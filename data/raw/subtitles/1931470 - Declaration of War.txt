- Adam?
Hello.
- Hello.
- Ready?
- Romeo.
- Are you joking?
- No.
Why?
- I'm Juliette.
- So we're doomed
to a terrible fate?
- I don't know.
"DECLARATION OF WAR"
Adam?
Adam?
- His hands are wild!
- His little twisted ears.
- It's crazy.
- I can't wait to get home.
- It'll be nice, honey.
Don't budge.
Or he'll never stop.
- Maybe he's hungry.
- You just fed him!
In five minutes, we'll get up.
- Five minutes are up.
I'm going.
All done.
You seem hungry!
Still hungry?
- He screeches.
One nonstop shriek
for three weeks.
A real nightmare.
It'll do us good.
- I think he'll sleep now.
- I'll call you back.
Talk to you soon.
- Who was it?
- Nikos.
He invited me to a party.
- Are you going?
- I don't know.
Not if you mind.
- Go on.
I'm exhausted anyway.
Unbelievable.
- Something's wrong.
- Stop repeating.
- It's because you don't react.
Say if you disagree.
Find a solution.
But you have no solution.
This kid is tyrannizing us.
- He's a baby.
He's three weeks old,
and babies cry!
- Go get him, feed him,
sleep with him?
- Almost done.
- I'm at a total loss.
Why can't we manage?
- You know, Romeo,
we had him fast.
Maybe you need time alone.
- I don't want to be alone.
Keep your suggestions
to yourself.
If you want to live alone,
say so!
Take him in your arms.
This kid just needs discipline.
- Yes, Rosi?
I'm busy.
Don't put her through.
I'm busy.
What's the problem?
- Adam has gas.
A bellyache.
It's hard to calm him down.
- No, the problem is,
he cries all day.
It's unbearable.
We don't know what to do
to keep our sanity.
We don't want a tyrant.
- You're right.
He's in perfect shape.
He has personality.
His motor skills
are humming along!
You breastfeed?
- Yes.
- When?
- When he's hungry.
- Meaning?
- When he asks.
- How many times a day?
- I don't know.
10 or so.
- Juliette, be honest.
Whenever he cries.
- All day long?
The problem is,
we're in a vicious circle.
He gets the breast nonstop,
no rhythm.
In fact, he's sick of food.
Stuffed.
Nauseated.
So he cries.
You think he's hungry.
You give him the breast again.
Think of a force-fed goose.
It's unbearable.
- What do we do?
- Space out the feedings,
so he gets on a schedule.
Today give him every two hours.
Tomorrow three.
Then four.
Honestly,
you have a tough few days ahead.
Even if he cries, resist.
- Can we let him cry?
- Not too long.
- How long?
- 15 minutes.
Tops.
Then go for a walk.
Distract him.
And if in three days,
he's still crying,
come back to me.
Questions?
- Thanks to Dr. Prat's advice,
Adam cries less
and sleeps more.
Everything falls back
into place.
Little by little,
they find balance.
Juliette and Romeo flourish,
and the child grows.
They both work
to make a living,
but other dreams don't pay off:
Juliette, to become an artist;
Romeo, the head
of a music company.
An only child,
he never knew his father.
His mother, Claudia,
raised him alone.
She is generous,
free-thinking, and independent.
Romeo and Juliette
are close to Claudia
and her companion, Alex
They enjoy being with them.
Juliette has two older sisters.
Her family is better off.
They helped them buy
an apartment.
- Tell me if I can help
with the renovations.
- Not much to do.
I love it like this.
- They have faith
in their future, their couple.
Young, happy, in love.
Life awaits, open-armed.
- I'm Juliette.
You're the new cook?
You okay, Romeo?
- No, not really.
- What's wrong?
- I gave Adam his bottle,
we played, and he vomited.
- You scared me!
It's nothing.
He's in the middle
of a bad cold.
I think he's teething.
- I feel bad.
We were playing just before.
I thought it was me.
- He's big now.
It's his teeth.
- He vomited it all up at once.
So I called.
Sorry to bother you.
- You're not bothering me.
Is he okay now?
- Now?
He's in great shape.
Smiling.
Covered in puke, but smiling.
I'll go change him.
- Call if you need to.
- Take care.
So?
What the hell?
You freaked me out,
little shit!
- You have a kid?
- Yeah.
- Boy or girl?
- Boy.
His name's Adam.
His dad was worried
because his son vomited.
- Try a little!
Go on.
- We won't finish
for when Adam gets back.
- We'll stay at Mom's.
It'll be fun.
It was like an old-age home.
- It always seems easy at first.
But it takes forever.
Like with girls.
- I fill all the holes?
- All of them.
- You're leaving?
- I have stuff to do.
- Can you come back tomorrow?
- No, thanks.
Once is enough.
You invite me over
to scrape walls?
- Stay in one area.
You won't get anywhere.
- Hello?
- It's Mom.
- Everything okay?
- I wanted to know,
does Adam have allergies?
- I don't think so.
Why?
- He vomited up the milk.
I gave him.
All at once.
It was quite something!
- Oh, yeah?
- Check this out.
Try this on for size!
Like my monster spatula?
- When did your nephews
start walking?
- Late, I think.
I don't know.
I can't remember.
Why does he keep vomiting?
- I don't know.
- Look at my finger.
This way.
Once more.
You're tired.
He's congested.
Teething.
He's ready for daycare.
- What's wrong?
- I hate this place
and these kids.
Somethings wrong with Adam.
I want to see Prat again,
and only her.
- The nurse said he was fine.
She'd have noticed.
- I've been watching him
for two hours.
He tilts his head,
like a retard.
- He's not tilting his head.
- I didn't notice at first.
The women who work here told me.
I'm going, but I'm afraid.
I'm scared shitless.
He's not normal.
- That's nonsense!
- No, it's not!
- Adam.
Did you have fun?
- Are you okay?
It's tough leaving
your child here.
It'll be fine.
- We're worried about Adam.
It's not like us.
Three things bother us.
He's not walking.
He vomits tons for no reason.
He has huge coughing fits.
And his head tilts to the right.
- Yes, that makes for
quite a lot.
Let's have a good look.
Is he anxious?
Change of habits?
- We're moving.
We can't sleep home yet
with the work.
He started daycare.
He's still adapting.
- Lots of new things!
Maybe he's nervous
about everything going on.
So he's coughing?
He's very congested.
If there's phlegm
he can't get out,
that would explain the vomiting.
Everything seems normal.
- Last night his right cheek
swelled up.
- I was just looking at that.
Hi, Adam.
Look at me.
Good boy.
There's something I noticed.
A slight facial asymmetry.
It's why it seems swollen.
But if you look when he smiles,
one side wrinkles more.
I don't know the reason,
but we should run some tests.
- Viral?
A girl I know had that.
Partial paralysis.
It went away.
- Maybe.
Bernard?
It's Ghislaine.
I have a child here
with slight facial asymmetry.
I've known him since birth.
He's absolutely perfect.
I thought so too.
Thank you, Bernard.
Here's what we do.
I'll make an appointment
with an ENT.
I'll do it quickly.
And call you tonight.
- Why an ENT?
She seemed flustered.
- She's the doctor.
We'll see what she says.
I want this done
before you leave.
- That night,
the pediatrician calls.
- Hello, Doctor.
A neurologist.
It was Prat.
We should see a neurologist.
- Juliette had been hired.
She had to go to Marseille
for Work.
She called her friend Louise
Whose father is a neurologist
in Marseille.
- She wants us to see
a neurologist.
- Really?
- Can I have your
father's number in Marseille?
Thanks.
I'll explain.
- What is it?
- Juliette calls Jean-Louis,
Louise's father.
She explains the situation.
- I'm going to Marseille
forwork.
I can take him along.
Do you know anyone?
- He says he'll try to get
an appointment with Fitoussi,
a renowned child neurologist
in a large hospital.
- Neurologist is for the head?
- He Won't know until tomorrow.
Romeo and Juliette
lie down on their sides.
They cannot sleep,
and listen to the radio.
- Less than half an hour ago,
bombs began striking
the Iraqi capital.
Explosions like this
have been heard.
- So war's declared?
Hello?
Yes.
Yes.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
- They held their breath.
- Louise's father.
We have a 5:00 appointment
with Dr. Fitoussi.
10:30.
Hurry.
We have one hour.
- Prepare his bottle.
- Juliette dresses quickly.
Alex gets the oar ready
- I'll get the car!
- Romeo tends to Adam.
Claudia does what she can.
- Take Adam.
- Get the stuff!
- Call Marion.
- Juliette calls the babysitter.
- Marion?
It's Juliette.
We're taking you
to Marseille now.
- The car's out front.
- See her?
- There!
- We can't miss this train.
- I'll explain.
- He's bigger.
I'm glad to see him.
- Call me.
- Perfect.
He seems in great shape.
I'm sure it'll be fine.
- Pediatrics, please?
- You go straight ahead
to the right,
straight to Pediatric Emergency.
- My son is Adam Bena√Øm,
for Dr. Fitoussi.
- We were expecting you.
This way.
- Where to?
- To your room.
- We're not sleeping here.
- Each child gets a room.
It's better than the hallway.
- Don't touch.
- Hello.
I'm Dr. Fitoussi.
- I'm going to make a call.
- So?
- In fact,
Adam has several problems.
He's not walking.
He vomits, chokes too.
And we're here
for the facial asymmetry.
- Yes, I see.
How long has it been?
The asymmetry, since yesterday.
- I want to see him move.
- Let go.
Come on, show her.
- Put him on your lap.
Look here.
There's some sort of blockage.
He's not moving his right eye.
We'll do a scan
to try to understand.
- In fact, all these?
He can do those exercises fine.
He's tired from the trip.
- We have to do this CAT scan.
It may be nothing,
but we have to check.
Did he eat recently?
- He had puree at noon.
- Perfect.
Give him nothing else.
We'll put him to sleep.
Don't worry.
It's a common procedure.
It'll be fine.
Stay with her to explain.
Come with me.
- We put babies to sleep.
It's a brain scan,
so they mustn't move.
We'll use a mask.
The anesthetic wears off
immediately.
- Dangerous?
- No, it's an anesthetic.
- Yeah.
They're doing a CAT scan.
It's his right eye.
So they want to check.
A CAT scan's normal.
It's how you see the brain.
Don't worry.
I'll call you.
Stop.
Give him to me.
Open this thing.
- Which way?
- Straight ahead.
- Go to the waiting room.
- Put him in his bed.
We'll put him to sleep.
Don't worry.
It'll be fine.
- No, not during the scan.
We'll come for you afterwards.
- How long will he be?
- Here you go, miss.
- Thank you, sir.
- So?
- Dr. Fitoussi
is coming to your room.
- Is there something?
- Come to your room.
- Tell me what it is!
Let me through.
Tell me what it is.
- You must leave at once.
- I won't go until you tell me
what my son has.
Please.
- He has a brain tumor.
- Listen to me.
The CAT scan shows a tumor
in the posterior fossa.
We can go inside.
We're lucky.
- So you can operate?
- Exactly.
You should also know
it's a big tumor.
It's a good sign.
- You mean benign?
- I can't tell you much
about the tumor.
A CAT scan isn't enough.
We need an MRI.
At that point,
we'll know more about the tumor.
You'll see that
with the neurosurgeon.
- It's operable.
- Yes.
- I want the best surgeon
for my son.
- You're in Paris.
Dr. Sainte-Rose
has a good reputation.
In Marseille,
we have Adam Schuman.
Jean-Louis Giraud knows him.
Anyway, it's the weekend.
We can't do anything now.
- Can I see him?
- He's in the recovery room.
Better tomorrow.
Get some rest.
I'll see you on Monday.
- Okay, Monday, thanks.
- Let's get a bite.
- Hello?
- Stay with him.
Tell him they can operate.
It's a good sign.
- Hello?
- Alex.
It's Juliette.
You have to tell Claudia.
I can't.
I told Romeo.
- Mom!
- Can I have a cigarette?
- Juliette?
You were so strong.
- Without you it's too hard
- I'm almost there.
We'll get through this.
- Juliette, I don't want Adam
operated here.
- We know no one in Paris.
Let's do it here, then go.
- It's not appendicitis.
I don't want him lobotomized.
- It's common surgery
Let's just do it!
- I want the best surgeon.
- We don't know the Paris guy.
We can meet this one.
- We don't live here!
Paris makes more sense.
We have no time frame.
The best hospitals are in Paris.
Let's go now!
A whisky.
Me too.
- They spoke all night.
At first, at odds.
- What do you think?
- I think Romeo's right.
Best to be careful.
We're strangers here.
In Paris we're all united.
We have to stay united,
because it may be long.
- Finally they decided.
- Okay.
- Dr. Sainte-Rose would operate
in Paris.
- You okay?
- No, I got in a fight
with my mom.
- Why?
- She asked me the aftereffects.
Juliette?
- What?
- I have something to ask.
- Go on.
- No outsmarting the doctors.
No idiotic theories,
no internet.
- It's a deal.
- Let's go.
- Where?
- To get some air, to the sea.
- We're not allowed to leave.
- I'll get special permission.
- Ah.
- What is it?
- A charm.
Keep it nearby.
In your pocket,
near the stroller, the crib.
It'll protect him.
Straight from China!
- See you all.
- We're out of
mother-child rooms.
Some should free up
throughout the evening.
Go back to reception,
and the intern
will figure it out.
Here it is.
- Adam, 18 months,
has a tumor
in the posterior fossa.
He's on cortisone.
How did you notice?
- He was vomiting wildly.
He wasn't walking.
It seemed like a problem.
Then he had facial paralysis.
So they did a scan.
- When do we see Sainte-Rose?
- You need an MRI.
That's tomorrow, I think.
As for the doctor,
he's very busy.
- Isn't he operating on Adam?
- I don't know.
Probably.
- She pissed me off!
Let's go to reception.
- We came to see
if a room freed up.
- One thing at a time.
So who are you?
- Adam Bena√Øm.
They said to come back
for a room.
- I doubt that.
Rooms are vacated
in the morning.
- We were told a child
was leaving tonight.
- Who said that?
- A woman in a white smock.
- Let's go.
- Wait?
- Come.
- Just a sec.
Can you check?
We'd like him alone.
The other kid is screaming.
He can't sleep.
- I understand,
but don't worry.
Children are rarely bothered
by screams.
Once a room frees up,
you'll have priority.
- Why?
- He's being operated on.
- Who's operating?
- No idea.
- No one knows anything!
- What I can do
is put a cot in the room.
- Perfect.
We'll sleep with him tonight.
- Only one parent can stay.
- We stay together.
- That's the rule.
- Who cares about the rules?
- Come on!
Thank you.
That was stupid beyond belief!
- What?
- Never ask the staff anything,
especially not about
the operation.
What got into you?
This is sheer madness!
Honestly, Juliette,
this is unbelievable.
You're making matters worse.
We're not at a hotel.
How embarrassing,
fighting over a room.
Stop wasting our energy
on unimportant things!
- I don't know what to do.
I'm lost.
- What's our goal?
- Sainte-Rose operates.
- Sure, but it's also
to keep our cool,
to get what we want,
and now we fucked up.
I'll go patch things up.
- I'll come along.
- No, you go to Adam.
- Look.
Let's see the little penguin.
- We can sleep here,
but discreetly.
- Great.
- Tomorrow we get a room.
- How's he?
- He's great.
- Want to go eat?
- Okay.
- The doctors!
- I see.
- Is Sainte-Rose there?
- For sure!
Which one is he?
- I'd say the tall one.
- The one with glasses
is doing the talking.
- The other's too young.
- I hope they'll see us.
- They're coming!
- I don't believe it.
They pass by without stopping.
- They don't know us.
- But still?
- Juliette?
- Sophie?
Why are you here?
- I'm a resident in cardiology.
- It's funny to meet here.
You were thinking pediatrics.
- No one can give me
a straight answer!
- And Sainte-Rose?
- The operating room!
He's always there.
When I see him,
I'll tell him off!
- Romeo, my son's father.
- It's for your son?
- He has a brain tumor.
- Damn!
Where is he?
- Doing an MRI.
- Is it recent?
- It's been five days.
They're operating.
- Excellent news.
Who's operating?
- Supposedly Sainte-Rose.
Know him?
- I know the name.
- Ever seen him?
- It's big here.
Good reputation.
- The invisible man!
- Surgeons are inaccessible.
There's a riddle
that sums it up.
Why is God different
from a surgeon?
God doesn't think
he's a surgeon.
I don't know Sainte-Rose.
I know he works miracles.
- It's spread
into the brainstem.
- We're full up.
- Adam's MRI.
- That must be Sainte-Rose.
- Come join us.
I'm Dr. Sainte-Rose.
I'll be operating on your son.
This is Dr. Harry,
our anesthetist.
The interns
I'll be working with.
Look.
The tumor is invading
nerves 6 to 12
and is compressing
the brainstem.
It's not easy,
but not impossible.
We'll be operating tomorrow.
No time to lose.
- Will it last long?
- About nine hours.
- Nine hours?
- Normal for this type
of surgery.
- Possible aftereffects?
- There mustn't be any.
- But if there are.
- There will be
no aftereffects.
Get some rest.
Don't count eggs
in the hen's ass.
Sleep well.
See you tomorrow.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
- I'm scared, Romeo, so scared.
- Scared of what?
- I don't know.
Lots of things.
- Know what?
Me too.
Let's say what we're scared of,
and we'll feel better.
- You start.
- I'm afraid it's a failure
and he becomes a vegetable.
- Me too.
I couldn't stand it if he became
handicapped because of that.
What else?
- I'm afraid
the trauma afterwards
will make him autistic.
- I'm afraid he'll go blind.
- If he can go blind,
he can go deaf.
- I'm afraid he'll go blind
and deaf.
- I'm afraid he'll go
blind, deaf, and mute.
- I'm afraid he'll go blind,
deaf, mute, and a dwarf.
I'm afraid he'll go blind,
deaf, mute, a dwarf,
and queer.
- Or blind, deaf, mute,
a dwarf, queer, and black.
- I'm afraid he'll go blind,
deaf, mute,
a dwarf, queer, black,
and a right-wing nutcase!
- What?
- I got scared.
That something happens
to Sainte-Rose
and he can't operate.
- Yeah, you're right.
That would really suck.
Let's pray Sainte-Rose is fine
even if we're atheists.
- You're right.
- Our father who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done...
- No, we can't start praying
like this.
I trust Sainte-Rose.
He's a class act.
- Not the kind of guy
who gets in trouble.
He'll be fine.
- Let's go to sleep.
Good night, honey.
- Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners
now and at the hour
of our death.
- Adam,
tomorrow you'll experience
something I've never known.
Today you impress me.
I feel so tiny
before what you'll undergo.
It's your life, not mine.
I respect it more than anything
- Some light.
- We're here.
- Adam, today's a big day.
You're getting an operation
for the lump in your head.
- You have to be brave.
The lump is a tumor.
It's why you're sick.
They'll take it out.
You'll sleep,
and then we'll be there.
- Adam, listen to me.
We can't come along,
but we're not abandoning you.
We'll see you after.
- I'm proud of you.
I love you so much.
Pisces.
"Anything can make you irate."
"Success: You work your way into
your coworkers' conversations."
Stay where you belong.
- You think it's here?
Where?
- Are you okay?
- Ah!
Whoo!
- Honey.
- This is Claudia, Romeo's mom.
- Shame to meet you like this.
- It's a little strange.
- I'm Juliette's father.
- I'm Claudia's wife.
- Claudia, this is my dad.
- So?
You're hiding.
Are you okay?
- And you?
What's that?
You'll need it more than me.
- She didn't want me
in Marseille.
She can be harsh.
Did you see Adam in Marseille?
Has he changed?
- Not really.
- If I had something so serious,
I'd want it to show.
- And Adam?
- It's almost been six hours.
- I dreamt of him last night.
He was 18.
We went to the movies.
It was nice.
- You okay, Mom?
Look, I brought champagne.
We'll open it later.
Cry now.
Not when Juliette gets here,
okay?
- Dad's been reading the paper
since he woke up!
- Everyone gathered
for the big day.
They waited it out
as best they could.
The weather was very nice,
despite the season.
Even if opinions at time
diverged,
if cultures
and tastes differed,
the only thing that mattered
was the reason they were there:
the child who today
wavered between fife
and dea th.
- My heart's racing.
- Mine too.
- Why is he here?
- It must be over!
- Dr. Sainte-Rose?
- Perfect timing.
I just finished.
Follow me.
Yes?
- See?
- The operation is a success.
No aftereffects.
I removed most of the tumor.
There's a tiny bit
on the brainstem,
but nothing to do.
He may become cross-eyed,
but that's an easy operation.
He'll have trouble swallowing
for a short time.
In sum, it's very good
that the operation went so well.
Now I must tell you
that the tumor is malignant.
- So he's dying?
- I don't know
the nature of the tumor.
It's being analyzed.
Results in three weeks.
- Is Adam in imminent danger?
- At worst,
we can keep him alive
with chemotherapy
until he's five,
and then switch
to radiation treatment.
- Five.
He'll live at least until five.
- At the Roussy Clinic,
he'll be in excellent hands.
But we'll have time
to discuss this.
- Understand it all?
- Remember the good stuff.
- So?
The operation's a success!
- We have to be strong,
Juliette.
- Yes.
- After the operation,
Adam stayed in intensive care.
Artificial coma,
then palliative care.
They visited him every day
until he fell asleep
for comfort and support.
Juliette‚Äôs and Romeo's
sole preoccupation then
was to explain to him
it Wouldn't last.
It would be over soon.
Now they knew that Adam's
recovery would be a marathon
but were still unaware
of the magnitude of the race.
- Juliette!
Juliette.
Unbelievable!
It's been ages.
I thought of you the other day.
How funny!
You live around here?
- Yes.
- Me too, almost.
I may buy a place.
The other day I saw Michel.
Still see Annick?
- We lost touch.
- Too bad.
I'll throw us a dinner.
We can catch up.
I have a bundle.
- A bundle of what?
- A baby!
You too, right?
- Yes.
- That's so amazing!
How old?
- He's two.
Just like Leo!
His name?
- Adam.
- That's nice!
And he's not too sick?
With day care, it's nonstop!
- Yes, he has cancer.
- That's awful.
I can't believe it.
Poor you.
How do you manage?
How did you notice?
Is it hereditary?
- No.
- Didn't they explain?
- There is none.
- There has to be.
- There isn't.
It can happen to anyone.
- Why the 4253?
Overdraft?
- It's easy.
I'd rather eat out than in
and buy my wife gifts.
- Joking?
- Not at all.
I could explain in detail,
but you'd pity me,
and that would be embarrassing.
- I need an explanation.
Do you make less?
Lose your job?
You'll have to give me
your credit card.
- How do you find him?
- Pretty good.
- How do you feel?
- Okay.
Pretty good too.
- We got the MRI results.
The tumor hasn't grown.
- Good sign?
- It means
his new treatment works.
- No, in fact.
With the ICE regime,
results should be better.
We have doubts
about Adam's tumor.
The MRI and the tumor's location
suggest that it may be
rhabdoid.
- What's that?
- A different kind of tumor,
more aggressive.
We'd change treatment.
- So what do we do?
- Nothing, for now.
- Why continue with ICE
if it's not working?
- We'll finish the treatment.
It's after the last session
we can tell.
And it allows us to rule out
if it's rhabdoid.
- Is the fact
that it hasn't grown a victory?
- Victory, no,
but we've made progress.
- Can I ask something?
- What are you asking?
- We know nothing
about this rhabdoid tumor.
She pulled it out of her hat.
What's the prognostic?
With the nicer cancer?
- Carcinoma.
- You said there was
a 70% chance of recovery.
And with the mean one?
- Aggressive tumors
are harder to treat.
- But you live?
- Less chance, but yes.
- What's the prognostic?
- It's hard to say.
A rare tumor
with sketchy results.
Chance of recovery is about 10%.
- When will we know?
- Unfortunately,
I can't answer that yet.
- Excuse me,
can you turn that down?
- Romeo!
Move!
Son of a bitch!
- Hi, Jeanne.
- You stood me up a year ago!
Never showed up,
never called back.
Now you show up.
Where's my birthday present?
- No present.
- You must.
- I don't.
I'm sorry!
What can I say?
I came empty-handed!
- Empty-handed?
I'll show you hands!
- Hit me.
- You asked!
- Stop bothering him!
You know his son has cancer.
- I know,
but I can still bawl him out!
- You're a pain.
Your dinner sucks.
Party sucks!
You annoy everyone!
- Relax!
- He has no sense of humor.
Unbelievable!
It's pathetic.
It's like beyond pathetic!
- Here's a good one.
- Small breasts
are closer to the heart.
- Don't make fun of her chest.
- Let me tell you something.
You two want to kiss now.
- Know who it is?
- It's Niko.
- Nikos.
Put your lips here.
- It's him who wants to kiss me!
- You don't know what you want!
I'm sorry.
- I just got passed over
for my friend.
Damn.
It gets me all flustered.
- I don't get it.
I thought you wanted
to kiss him.
- I want to kiss him.
- What the hell is going on?
An Open Kiss party?
It's an Open Kiss party.
Everyone kiss.
It's cool.
Open Kiss party!
So kiss me.
- I'd like Pediatrics, please.
- When do I set the alarm for?
8:00.
- It won't be easy.
- It's Adam's mother.
I wanted to know if all's well.
Great, thanks a lot.
Everything's fine.
No more fever.
Sleeping like a baby.
- Lousy magazines!
- They're turning my brain
into sponge.
- Kikou, honey!
- Don't call me that here!
- How are you, Philippe?
- Where's Adam?
- It's time for the machine.
- That machine!
I hate it.
And the chemo?
He's not vomiting too much?
He must be beat.
- The doctors say he's great.
Biggest baby in the ward!
The onesie?
- Ask Dad.
Tell her!
I laid out a bag of onesies.
He forgot it!
- He's out of clean clothes.
- She's upset about the onesies!
- I forgot them!
It's not a major incident!
- Get lost!
You annoy me!
- Are you crazy?
No big deal.
Stop it!
- So selfish!
- I think they're done.
- Wait here and stay put!
See all those obese people?
It's wild.
A family of obese people.
- And a real lot of them!
- Yeah, tons.
I'd never seen so many.
- Definitely every layer
of society here.
- The new MRI results
are not satisfactory.
Now we know for sure
that the tumor is rhabdoid.
- Is it serious?
- Adam has
a very serious disease.
- We couldn't know before?
- No.
- You think we lost time?
- It's a rare
and complex cancer.
We're moving
as fast as possible.
We'll meet again very soon
to discuss treatment.
Listen to me.
It's a serious cancer,
but nowadays it can be beaten.
- All we can do
is foster Adam's development.
Give him structure.
- We'll take things
as they come along.
Day by day,
not like each one's the last.
- We'll get government aid
to hire someone
who can take care of Adam.
- We'll have quality time
with him in the afternoon.
It's healthier.
- Or we'll never keep this up.
- We'll take daily notes
and share them with you.
- If our parents ask about Adam,
don't bother answering.
- Especially my mom.
Not to keep her in the dark,
but she panics
and imagines the worst.
It gets us nowhere.
- I have nothing to tell them.
It's not their concern.
You're the parents.
Thank you, doctor.
- We start a new treatment.
Potent chemotherapy
and a marrow transplant.
He'll stay in a sterile room
to avoid bacterial infection.
Only you can visit him.
Ms. Weiss
will explain the protocol
in the sterile ward.
- Only his parents
can visit him.
- The contamination risk
is too strong.
- You can stay in
the Parents Wing to be nearby.
Our social worker will explain.
- Furthermore,
we're selling the apartment.
We're broke.
- We'll stay at the hospital
however long it takes.
- This is another level.
You'll have to be strong.
- This is another level.
We'll have to be strong.
- These brochures
explain everything.
- Turn around.
Lift your arms.
Now we'll enter
the sterile ward.
- Romeo, it's time to get up.
You're a pain.
Don't take too long.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- How's Adam?
- He's okay.
- Give him a kiss.
- I will.
How are you, honey?
Did you sleep well?
What are you doing?
Don't play with that.
You know that.
What do you want to do?
You want to draw?
Play with stickers?
Stickers?
- I have too many tickets.
- You didn't even
put me in the show.
I'm one of the best dancers
in the group!
I'm a country legend.
- The Worst is Juliette.
Always the same?
- My heart is with you.
- Hey, big guy.
- Now I'm coloring it gray.
Clara died.
- Damn.
Poor thing.
- I need coffee.
Can you stay?
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, thanks.
You left Adam alone?
- I told his nurse.
Upset I didn't wake up early?
- Not at all.
It was strange
to hear Clara died.
I wanted to talk,
and you were cold.
- It's normal I was cold.
I walk in,
and you announce that.
I won't think of that.
I protect myself.
Fuck the rest.
Crying for someone
you don't know,
that's your problem.
Adam was there.
It's morbid.
- I didn't say it morbidly.
I was just scared.
- I'm scared too.
But there's no use comparing.
That's not what this is about.
You're upset I was late.
- No.
- Yes.
But you won't admit it.
- It's true.
I was upset you were late.
- Why not say so?
- I hate to be a killjoy.
- You are a killjoy.
So what?
You're right.
I'm a dick.
I didn't want to come.
I needed some air.
I'm sick of being here.
Everyone's on vacation.
We're stuck here.
- Where did you go?
- Out for coffee.
It was depressing.
So I took a walk,
and that's it.
I'm so fed up, Juliette.
Things were good.
We were happy.
Why did this happen to us?
Why Adam?
- Because we can overcome it.
- You do me good, Juliette.
If I get through this,
it's thanks to you.
- I'm sorry for earlier.
I'll tell you the real stuff,
not the fake real.
- What was that again?
- Come on, you understand.
- Juliette.
- Me too.
- Juliette and Romeo continued
like this for two years.
They put on a brave face.
They had no choice.
- They did it for Adam,
for themselves.
But reality
caught up with them.
They stopped Working,
stopped seeing friends,
out themselves off.
Then exhaustion settled in,
solitude.
They separated,
got back together
several times,
then separated for good.
They each started a new life.
They knew
they'd never be the same
but would stay
close to each other forever.
And before
their enormous ordeal,
they remained strong.
Destroyed, for sure.
But strong.
- How old are you, Adam?
- Eight.
- What grade?
- Second.
- Is it going well?
- Yes.
- Any favorite subjects?
- Yes.
- Like what?
- Math.
Can I play Nintendo?
- Not right away.
- The operation took place
over five years ago.
The remission period is over.
Understand?
- So he's cured?
- His chance of getting cancer
is the same as anyone else's.
- Can I play Nintendo?
- Mute it.
- When is the next MRI?
- In three years.
Just to check.
Which game is it?
- "Shrek."
- Who's Shrek?
The big green one?
- Mm-hmm.
- Things will be good now.
Even if it's never easy.
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you.
- I'm very happy.
