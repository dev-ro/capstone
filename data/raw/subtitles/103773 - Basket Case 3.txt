Searching for Traveller Conversions
Duane, wait a minute.
No, I can't.
I'm... I'm pregnant.
I've been pregnant for six years.
What
We tried to have him, but he didn't want to come out.
So, Grandma took care of me until he was willing to be born.
What
Don't be afraid of him
He is not dangerous at all
He just comes out sometimes to get some fresh air
No! No!
Duane, don't do this to me.
No, don't do that, please.
No, no, why?
Look at me. Look at me.
Please, Doane.
Ignore me
Where did Susan go?
Find Duane for me.
This has got to be a joke.
Even if we are separated, we are not two separate people.
It's just two separated flesh
I mean, cut us both up.
It doesn't make us two separate people
Just makes us two halves
But I know how to do it.
I know how to solve the problem
I know what it takes to get things back on track
I know how to solve the problem for both of us
Hey, can I talk to you for a few minutes?
What's that? You're having fun right now.
-You're in love? No!
No, no.
You are just an incomplete person
Unless I'm happy, you can't be happy.
You can't fall in love until I do.
I don't think it matters what happened before
This is the only way to solve the problem
Duane
Hey, it's okay. We're back together.
Title: The Devil in the Basket 3
Anyone?
I'm fine now. I'm fine.
I think it's pretty good.
You can let me out now.
I'm fine.
Everything will be fine. I know what I'm doing now.
I can control myself again
I'm perfectly fine. No more problems at all.
Not at all crazy anymore!
You can let me out now.
Really!
Good morning, Duane.
Oh, hello, I remember you.
Oh, Duane, I know this is all very hard for you.
But it's just as hard for everyone else
Where is my brother?
He should be here with me.
I sewed him on with my own hands
But I can't find him
We have to get your brother off you.
Sewing him back up like that won't solve the problem, Duane.
That's painful.
When did this happen?
It's been months, Duane. Don't you remember?
Oh, and where did he go?
I want to talk to him.
I could feel him
But I can't hear him anymore.
I mean, I can't hear a thing.
I know he's out there.
But he just won't talk to me.
He will. Wait until he wants to talk to you.
In the meantime, we've decided to take a vacation.
We would like you to come with us
It's going to be fun.
Can I have some muffins?
You know, Duane, in the time you've been locked up.
There's been, uh, a little change here.
How is my brother?
Yes, Duane, of course he's fine.
In fact, he's never been happier.
His girlfriend is also
His girlfriend?
Eve, remember?
They are waiting with great joy for
The arrival of a wonderful new little life
A new little life?
She's pregnant, Duane.
His brother's girlfriend is pregnant
You mean I'm going to be an uncle
Come on in.
Thanks simen
That's simen
He's new.
His tea is great. It's great.
This way, Duane.
We were all worried about Eve.
There is a good chance she will have a difficult delivery
And it's dangerous.
And we're not quite sure
What kind of a baby she will give birth to
This was our first trip in years.
We'll take an old school bus.
Go see Uncle Hell in Georgetown
He's the only one I trust.
doctor who can handle this kind of thing.
I thought we were here to see Blaire.
I need to explain to him.
Blaire
Blaire, it's me, Duane.
Your brother
I know you're in there and I just
 Just wanted to say I'm sorry
Sorry
For everything, I swear
Why don't you say anything
Why don't you talk to me
What do you want me to do?
I was out of my mind
I'm confused. It's a mess.
I need your help.
Brothers shouldn't not talk to each other
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Time Duane
Give him some time.
I want to apologize to you.
I never meant to kill Susan.
You certainly don't want to, Duane.
Neither Susan nor Benord would ever
Blame you for that unfortunate accident
Benord Who is Benord
That's Benord.
That's Benord.
Oh, my God.
I didn't know then. I didn't know.
Although Susan and Benord are dead.
But what you did to blaire
Is hard to forgive
I did it because
I think it's all his fault
Duane, stay away from your brother.
Do you understand?
All right, everybody, you should be all sorted.
Put your bags in the car and get ready to go.
Relax Frangreid, relax.
Stop fidgeting, Duane.
Okay, but...
Wendy, you look good.
You do not eat all the cornflakes Oh
Do you want a blanket?
Sharon, you're always reading.
Good to drink soda Elom
Do you want another sandwich?
What? Oh, I can't help it.
I told you to go to the bathroom before leaving
Oh, Segiral, you're having fun.
What is this
This is for Eve.
Oh, very good.
Our little mother-to-be, what do you think?
I can still sense that he's angry.
He's blaming me, but he just won't talk to me.
I know, I know.
But he's never been so quiet.
I can always hear him in
talking in my head
But I just want us to be together
Just like we used to be
I hear you. Okay, yeah.
You are right.
What's going on?
There's nothing to worry about.
She just started having pains.
Yes, my Susan has been like this for months.
No sales pitch
Hi, it's me in there, Sheriff Graven.
I have a gift for you
Please wait a moment
Andrew
How's it going, man?
Very good
What the hell is this?
This is for little Hell. I just found him on the side of the road by a
abandoned washing machine on the side of the road and found him
I think it would be something he would like
Just what he likes. Put it down first.
Give it to him later
You know, I'm still using that remote control that Hell gave me a few years ago.
Hell gave me the remote control
He can still use it.
Although it takes a little time
Come on, come in. It's like your own home.
I haven't seen you for a long time
I can't stay long. I'm just driving by.
Give something to Hell and say hello.
You know the last time I saw little Hell
when he was just a little boy.
Coffee, police.
What is this
Coffee, Sheriff.
Well, sure, why not?
Please step back
Coffee is ready.
Drink it.
Ouch, quite good oh
Yes, just like his other crazy inventions.
This one was just finished last week
How's he doing?
It's hard to explain
Sometimes good, sometimes bad
Sometimes he doesn't even see me
Is Tom Fox bothering you again?
Oh, no, sometimes there are still some kids
Wandering around and sneaking in.
No matter what, if something like this happens again
You call me
I will help you to solve it properly
Thanks Andrew
You and Hell take care of yourselves.
You too, Sheriff.
Thank you very much!
Thank you for the coffee Little Hell
People, listen to me.
Frank drove a little bored
And the radio has no sound
Since we have such a long way to go
How about I sing?
Oh, great. The drugstore.
Frank, stop over there.
Nice driving, Frank.
Does this come in extra large sizes?
That idiot parked that bus outside
The car is parked in the middle of the street, stupid ah
I'm sorry, officer.
I don't know what's wrong with me
Is that your bus, ma'am?
My car broke down when I started it.
But, I told my nephew.
He can come to my tea party
So, I took my old school bus that I used to take my kids to.
old school bus out
Well, I guess I'm just a little...
Tension
You know I've been thinking for a long time why she hasn't said anything
All this only means one thing
My brother is jealous of me
It's as simple as that. I'm good-looking.
And I'm smart, that's why he always wanted
Everyone's attention
Every time you finally think everything is okay
Then something happens
Are you the owner of the card?
Hello? Hello?
How are you doing?
I'm Duane Bradley.
Who
Duae Bradley
The infamous Bradley twins?
That door can open well
The famous Times Square freak twins
You can not get out of the well
I'm a prisoner, and you're going to help me and my brother escape.
A prisoner?
So how did you get out of my dad's prison?
Your father's what
His prison
He's the sheriff here.
Then he can get us out of here.
Because, if he arrests me.
Then he has to arrest him too
That means we'll be together again.
Why are you under arrest?
You see the small trailer behind the car shows it
See the basket above you
That's where my brother lives.
Inside the basket?
Yeah, he's kind of
You know, the freaky ones.
You're a fantasist, Duane, you know that?
I had a little girl and now she's all grown up.
I can't get her to spend much time with me now.
Oh, I understand. My nephew is also
Gotta go, gotta go
Wait a minute.
Ms. Lou, I'd like you to meet my daughter, Ope.
How are you? You've met my nephew.
Yeah, it's cute, but it's really weird.
I'm afraid he's already very sick.
Goodbye, Sheriff.
You know what, Dad?
These two people have problems
How are you guys doing?
Frank sholen, how are you guys doing?
Let me see
Oh, great. That looks great.
How are you guys doing?
Frank, how are you? I saw you driving the car.
How are you?
Liz, how are you, my dear?
You look fabulous.
Miss Marcol, I'm glad you could make it.
Good to see you
Everybody get in.
It's great to see you again.
You must be Mr. Bradley.
Duane Bradley
Can I borrow a sharper knife
It's just too far away, Ruth.
I'm sorry about Susan.
Where is Duane's brother?
He won't get into trouble.
Excellent
Where is our mother-to-be?
She was in the car when we were leaving New York.
She started having pregnancy reactions
I'll check it out.
Duane
You must be Eve.
I'm Uncle Hell, I'll take good care of you.
Now, I need to see the baby.
Do not worry, everything will be fine.
We better get her inside as soon as possible.
That's it. That's it. Careful...  Wait a minute.
She's having a baby.
What's going on?
Excellent
What's going on?
This is Eve's amniotic fluid
Get out of the way, everyone. Get over there.
Wait a minute, that's mine.
You've come at the right time, Ruth.
The little lady... Can't delay any longer
God.
I was so nervous.
You think of little Hell, don't you, Ruth?
How's he doing?
He is super eager to see you
You haven't spoken to him in a long time
Haven't seen him for a long time
He's all grown up now, Ruth.
Tall, strong, and much smarter than me.
Actually, he's the one who delivered the baby.
Little Hell
I taught him. He did every step.
I'm just his assistant.
Little Hell Little Hell Little Hell
Come on down!
Everyone is waiting to see you.
There's another little lady who's about to have a baby.
Little Hell
Aunt Ruth is here too?
Of course she's here. Open the door quickly.
Mom!
Son
I barely recognized you. You're so...
Really grown up
You know what, Duane?
I didn't start out like this.
I didn't know from the start
of these special people
But I was lucky enough to have Uncle Hell to deliver my baby.
Now
Both of them will help Eve and Blaine
I'm going too
Think I can trust you?
I mean, if I unlock this for you.
You're not going to run away or do something stupid, are you?
Of course not.
All right, then.
Let me help you untie
We don't want the little baby to see
His Uncle Duane is tied up.
I know you won't do anything to make me
regret letting you go now
I won't. I'm much better, really.
But thank you, thank you for giving me this opportunity.
Eve is in the last bedroom in the first floor hallway
Come on over and join us!
Good
Okay, okay, how's it going?
Very good
How's everyone getting ready?
Elmo, can you take this over for me?
We need to get the others out.
We can't do a cesarean section
Because we don't have the tools to stitch her up
Of course
Is it okay for Blaine to stay?
Of course.
I always thought it was a blessing for a father to see a child born.
It is a happy thing, what do you think?
Oh, yes.
Blaine
Oh, Blaine, I know this is all very difficult for you.
But I want you to stay here.
Share this moment with us
Come witness the miracle of life, please.
It's time to struggle again, damn it.
Take him into the room.
It won't hurt, Duane. I promise.
This won't hurt.
No, no, help.
Don't struggle anymore
No, no, no.
Hold him down. If he moves again.
I can't do it. Hold him down.
No, Blaine, no, he's not like other doctors.
He's a friend. He's a friend.
Blaine Stop
Get out, Blaine.
You're such a big douche!
Get him out of here.
Hell I should have thought of this long ago
Blaine has an overreaction to doctors.
What happened to her?
Okay, calm down.
Harder! Take a deep breath and push.
Use force Use force
Give me a towel.
Use force, use force, use force
Who is there
I forgot your name, but I'm here.
Duane
Oh, my God, it's so good to see you.
What are you doing here?
I kept running and running
I don't even know where I should be running
Then I remembered you said something about prison.
So, here I am.
But why?
Because I ran. From the window.
Uncle Hell and the others are waiting for the baby to be born
They don't even know I've run away
Uncle Hell?
You mean Dr. Rockwell?
I don't know. But you have to help me.
What are you doing at Hell's?
Can we get out of here first?
I mean, just the two of us, before they find us.
Listening to Duane
I don't know what's really going on
But, I'm sure my dad would be happy to help you.
Can you be the only one?
I mean, other people would have arrested me.
I just... I just...
God, I just don't know what to do.
I just want my brother back.
Back From Where
I can't tell you that I'm scared.
What to be afraid of
Scared of me?
You'd hate me if I told you.
Oh, Duane. Duane.
What if I told you
I will love you if you tell me
What if I said I only love people who tell the truth
What if I said I only love those who have the courage to face themselves
If I say I only love those who are brave enough to run naked
And while running naked, he proudly said
This is the true nature of the master it
Really?
She was supposed to have my uncle deliver the baby
You rush her too fast, she will not be able to stand
Wait a minute, I touched something. I touched something.
God, the first light of life
I saw it. I saw his descent.
Don't get me wrong, I didn't mean to be rude.
It's just that I got confused for a moment.
Wait a minute, there's another one, there's another-
There are two... twins! There are two
Hold him well. Hold him well. I'll pull this out.
And one more and one more
It's triplets. She broke the record.
Oh my God, is there another one?
That means she gave birth to four
Don't hug the stupid cat anymore
And ah
You can break the record now.
Five. She gave birth to five.
Five brand new lives
Give me a cigarette.
Hell, the sixth one, there are six.
This... this is unbelievable.
sextuplets
And there's more
Oh my God, not to mention the seventh one.
No.7 Shine on!
Oh, my God.
Legendary, number 8, come on.
I guarantee you with my head
You will be able to accomplish this
No. 9 What an exciting time!
Brother must eat a big meal
Here we go. Here we go.
Number 10! Keep it up! Come on!
Come on, comrades!
Give birth, try hard to give birth!
Explode your universe and keep on giving birth!
I love it! I love this!
This is simply
In the excitement that can not be expressed in normal language
Twelve. That's crazy.
Continue to babble in excitement
You're so good. I love it. It's so good.
I really wish Blaine was here.
He's so puzzling.
Chanting a poem in a spring dream
I love you to death I carry your breath your height
Everything about you
Continue to recite poems in spring dream
Possess Us Blaine
Possess us
Are you awake?
Dude, you're a dad.
See for yourself, Blaine.
You need to change a large basket
No, wait, let me out!
I didn't do anything!
Anyone listen to me?
Please!
You better keep your mouth shut.
If you don't know exactly what you're talking about
Why did my dad tell me he didn't say he was gone?
Baby, calm down.
Your father went to the city early in the morning
He said he had something to do.
Did you find him?
I'm looking... looking!
I only have two hands, but...
There are thousands of criminals here.
I found it
I found him! I found him! I found him!
Oh my God!
You're really Duane Bradley.
I don't like it. I didn't say anything.
Is this your brother, boy?
That means he's around, right?
Brother I don't have a brother
I don't know what you are talking about
I know where I've seen you before
What are you doing in this town?
Nothing, I was just passing by.
He lives in a home in Hell Rockwell.
Fuck, I used to trust you.
Duane, it's not my fault.
You're on the nation's most wanted list.
You're a bitch.
You're more vicious than Grandma Ruth.
Who
I don't know. I've never heard of her.
Bradley Bradley...
Sir, can you come over here?
What's up, young man?
You better not be looking for trouble
What do you want to say
I've seen this
What is it
What's happening
We're going to Rockwell's house.
Yes, the doctor may be in trouble.
You just wait here for your father.
Yes
We'll let you know when we're ready.
Everyone Everyone
Has anyone seen Duane?
What about Blaine?
Blaine, Blaine, put that down.
Stop
Put it down. Put it down.
Blaine, you're not being good. Blaine, you're not being good, Blaine.
Everyone, be quiet!
There's an exhausted mom in the next room
and twelve nursing children
Uncle Hell is still upstairs
Now I can't find Duane again
So, please
Leave me alone.
How's he doing?
With most of his face torn off
He's not bad
I'll stay here with him.
You go downstairs and play with them
All right, then.
Thank you
Tell them to be quiet downstairs
I don't see anyone.
So maybe I can stay in the car.
Sure, just in case.
Then you can go in and see
That way, we won't
Both are outside the car
Then one of us can
You shut up, boy.
Did you know that I have read
articles about this kind of thing
Articles about monsters like Blaine
Some come from spaceships, some come from what?
Bermuda Delta
They even have the ones that fall directly from the sky
It's like a fucking giant
Flying scary Halloween monster
They're holding a saw!
Will you shut up!
Listen
Do you hear the music?
Looks like a party
Let's look closer
Holy shit! Holy shit!
What's all this?
Oh my God!
It's incredible.
Look at that big one over there
I think we found it.
A strange species concentration camp now
Let's go. Let's go.
Wait a minute, I don't see him.
I didn't see the Bradley brother.
Forget what that brother bar I quit
Wait a minute, you idiot, wait a minute.
I'll go find the sheriff.
Let's go to the sheriff first
We came here for a million dollars.
We must get it!
You see that window open over there
We're going in through there.
Move it.
The Bradley monster is in this house.
We need to find it.
Get in.
I don't see anyone
Go inside and take a closer look
Get in. Get in.
I don't like it.
I don't like this!
I don't like this at all.
I don't like it!
What did you find out.
Nothing.
There's nothing. No one.
There is no Blaine and there is no one here.
Give me a hand
Blaine is not here.
He must have been here.
It may not be in this room
But he is definitely in this house
We just have to find out where he is
We're going to check the place out.
That's just crazy.
I'll see if there's anyone at the door first
Hell, they're right at the door.
I think they're coming this way.
That's not good. Not good at all.
We should get out quickly.
Those things will find our
They'll tear us apart.
They'll eat us alive.
They will dig out our hearts
Then drink our blood
Oh my God.
What the hell!
They are all Blaine babies
Damn so many Blaine babies
God, it's like a puppy dog.
Let's get going!
If they are Blaine's
We can use them to trap him.
Oh, my God! What is that?
Oh my God, there he is. There he is.
Shoot him! Shoot him!
Hurry up and shoot him!
I got it. Shit, I got it!
Do you think they heard you?
You're dead. You're dead.
Damn it, let's go!
Where are the children?
Catch them! Catch them!
Come on, get in the car. Come on.
What's that? What's wrong?
I don't know
I think I hear Blaine.
In my mind's eye
I think something is wrong.
You're a really strange person, Duane.
Dangerous and confusing
Just like we say primitive like animals
It's like your brother.
Animals like you
Must be kept in a cage
What you are doing
You are an animal, Duane.
But I am also an animal
And I know how to
To deal with animals like you
Bad Prisoner
Very bad, very bad prisoners.
You broke the law, so now
You must pay the price
You're a naughty boy, aren't you?
Naughty Naughty
A naughty boy like you
Must be punished
Oh, Duane.
What is this
What I molded to
What is this
This
This is where I lost
part of my body
Do you understand?
This is where I lost my brother
Jesus Christ, what the hell is going on here?
Oh, Dad, thank goodness you're here.
I told you not to play with my prisoners anymore
He attacked me.
Put your clothes on, little girl.
And throw your stupid whip for me
I can explain
Fuck, who the fuck are you?
My name is Mr. Duane Bradley.
I was completely forced to
Didn't I see you on that school bus today?
I've seen you before
He's a pervert, Dad.
His brother is a monster.
That's enough of you! Now you put your clothes on
And go home.
You're grounded, miss.
You're grounded for the next ten years.
The car is confiscated, no vacation
I will not buy you a pony again either
But, Dad, you don't understand.
Yes, I should have known better.
If you keep being such a slut, I'll lock you up!
You'll never get out again.
You won't believe it.
There are monsters, a lot of monsters
Many, many monsters ah monstrous ah
Oh, my God, there you are, Sheriff!
Look at this! Oh, my God! There you are, Sheriff!
Look at this.
What the fuck is this shit!
Your brother gave birth to me. I shot him.
I beat that Blaine guy to death.
No! No! -No!
You bastard!
No one can kill my brother.
He's not dead. He's not dead. He's not dead.
So, how's the doctor?
I didn't see him, I saw a lot of monsters.
We'd better get back now.
Give me a shotgun.
No, Sheriff, I'm not going!
Calm down, you don't understand.
That house is a monster hell.
We need to bring more weapons.
We need a lot of firepower.
All right, all right, listen.
You two have been through a lot tonight.
Belly, you take the Bradley kid.
Baster put the basket kid back in the car
Then we go back.
Where are Verna and Bary?
Rotation
Today is Friday
Call the others
Tell them all to get the hell out of here.
In the meantime, I'll go there again myself.
Hell, Hell, it's me, Sheriff.
Open the door!
Hell
Whoever's in there, you either open the door.
Or I'll shoot the door.
Now
God.
Can I help you, Sheriff?
It's full of surprises!
What's going on here?
What's going on?
First, your men killed this young lady.
Young lady
A respectful mother who just gave birth to 12 children
All stolen by your people!
When they broke into the house
I want to talk to Hell
I want those kids back.
I want to know who you are
And who they are
And what exactly did you do to Hell?
What do you want if you don't say it?
You shoot me too!
Don't tell me how to do it Miss Rlth
Please don't tell me what to do
Sorry
I appreciate your concern, but my dad is fine.
These people are our guests
People
Who the hell are they?
People like me Sheriff
Where are you
I'm in the lobby, sheriff. Come here. Take a look.
You know, I must have...
Made a stupid mistake, Sheriff.
I'm telling you, my son is dead.
But he's not dead.
He's right behind this door.
Now he wants to meet you face to face
So you two can share its beauty
Little Hell
Hello, Sheriff.
Little Girl
Hello, little devils.
They are actually quite cute
Where did they get it?
Dr. Rockwell's
It must be inherited from their family
No way!
Yes, his stupid grandson is
What do we do?
Lock up
Wait a minute, my dad said
I can keep one
Yeah? Did he say that?
He will, if I want to.
Look!
Doesn't she look cute?
Oh my God.
This is little Blaine
This is a Blaine little baby
This is Blaine's child, and this is my brother's child.
This is the cutest pet, right?
What do you think?
What? Pets?
No
I was wondering if I could train him
Teach him a few simple tricks, you know.
Sit down, roll around, play dead.
It's not a pet, you dumbass.
This is my nephew
Look at all the stuff in there.
There must be more at Dr. Rockwell's.
Here's what Belly and Baster had to say
Damn, how much is there?
I mean, are there two more, or are there 20?
Or maybe there are 200 ah
I really think those two words are not reliable
And already I think they are a little hysterical
They certainly don't get hysterical for no reason
They must have seen more.
Don't think about it. Let's all take a break.
What if there are all kinds of monsters in the house?
What if there are various shapes and sizes of monsters?
What if those monsters are much bigger than the ones here?
Bigger and stronger
And more brutal yet
You're making me more and more cranky, you know?
How do you know they are not out there at this time
How do you know they're not hiding in the darkness of the night
waiting for an opportunity to rush in and get them out?
Get them out?
Get them out?
Are you saying they're going to do a
classic, traditional-style jailbreak?
You saw their teeth.
They could have bitten us through.
Bite us through?
Then let them try
We can't just sit here.
Someone has to do something about it.
You're just scared out of your wits, okay?
No, no, no.
It's not good at all. It's not good at all.
Not good, not good, not good...
This is not good at all
What sound
What sound
Take it easy. Here you go.
Hello
What the hell is this?
I don't know, but it's heavy.
He's delightful, isn't he?
Do you not want to pinch him, pinch him?
Can you get out of here and leave me alone for a while?
What's going on?
He's still alive.
He is here
Blaine!!!
What a situation!
Oh my God!
You're alive. You're alive.
You are still alive
Boys. I'm Greeven.
I'm on my way back from Dr. Hell's house.
On my way back, I tell you.
Baster and Belly are absolutely right.
We do have to fight back.
Oh my God.
[Prayers]
Duane, Duane, please.
Just make him stop.
He's going to kill every single one of them
Oh no.
We need to get them out.
That's a lot of them.
No
Oh, no.
My baby girl ah daughter ah
Baby...
All right, listen.
Forget Grandma Roth, forget the kids.
We took a bus back to our hometown
Change the name, change the identity
We can find a quiet town
Start over
I don't know, maybe we could open a little store.
No, don't!
That's not good enough.
You can't get hurt.
Not now
Not when we can just be together
Help!
Help!
God, God, God.
I need to do something.
I need to find someone to save us.
I need to find him a doctor.
I have to think of something else.
Uncle Hell. Uncle Hell is a doctor.
Uncle Hell can...
Little Hell Little Hell...
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I've got an idea.
That's a good one.
Let's see. I just need to get the
power switch in the tighter...
[gibberish]
Hey, look, I got a light for you.
Do you think this will work?
Yes, of course.
Just put it over there
Someone's awake.
Hi, do you remember me?
Listen, before you get mad and bite me.
I have to heal your hand first
Because you lost a lot of blood
But you're fine now. So am I.
So, if we could talk first about
Look, I know this is all my fault.
Yes, if it weren't for me.
Eve would still be alive, but...
Listen, listen, listen.
Those two bitches who killed Eva are still alive.
Wait a minute before you go crazy. I have something to show you.
Excuse me, can I borrow the remodeling drawings to show my brother?
Sure. Hey Duane.
Have you considered butterflies or other creatures?
We can put them in the music to represent their entrance
No
Anyway, I tied your arm.
I can't help but think
What would you be like if you didn't have a limp
Of course the answer is obvious
So I asked little Hal to help.
We've been working on this for hours.
Let me explain to you
Got this structure diagram?
This is the control of the brain can control the 45 ° angle of rotation
Also equipped with a razor side of the 40 buttons is to control ... (various explanations)
Did you come in last night?
I didn't think I'd see you today.
Now is the time to waste time, little girl.
My handcuffs are ready.
The bullets for my robbery are loaded
It's time to give you a special taste
I've got my whip ready to go.
So, come on.
Wait a minute.
If someone reads the letter sent to you
I can never have to
bring up this sad past
So we can remember you as if you were still alive
Before the pain wakes us up
You have long since turned into a wisp of smoke
The pain of love can no longer continue
For your heart has long been in the arms of God
It's okay. It's okay.
Oh, dear, Eva.
Oh, Eva who will always live in my heart
Oh Eva, your silence makes my heart ache
Oh, Eva, buried under the little mound of earth in this place
Just because you are no longer their favorite
I'm afraid we're in more danger.
Important things to consider
Eva's children Bailey's children
Our children are still imprisoned in prison
They must demand freedom
I think we should take action
Instead of sobbing here
I think we should give them a better world
The days of hiding and hiding should be over
This should also be our world
They are just as ugly
But they never hide
So we shouldn't continue to hide either
I think you know where they are.
Where are the kids, Officer?
How can you do this to an innocent child
We're just innocent civilians, Sheriff.
I demand that you release them immediately I demand that you release them immediately
I've been waiting for you for a long time, lady.
I know you are here for them.
So everyone give me calm down
Otherwise, Ms. Granny will be the first to take a bullet.
What do you want me to do, officer?
A deal. I want Bailey.
He is responsible for the monsters
You give me Bailey.
I'll give you the kids
Very simple
Deal not
Of course, officer, tonight, at midnight.
Meet at the old factory site in town
Okay, you tell the irrelevant people to go home.
I assure you
Anyone want lunch now?
What are you doing? Get out of my store!
I'd like 25 cheeseburgers, 70 hot dog burgers.
80 butter burgers, 90 bacon cheeseburgers...
Packing?
Hello? I'm a police officer.
Anyone?
Duane, anyone?
You little bastard.
Oh, my God, that's so emotional.
Today, ladies and gentlemen.
We have invited special guests who are particularly important and shining in the community
They were only interviewed by our radio station
Come meet David and Basil.
Two deformed people
Some people think they are strangely ugly and disgusting
And some women find it very fascinating
So today's topic is the deformed man who makes it difficult for women to extricate themselves
What's going on here? Who are you? What's in the basket?
I'm Granny Ruth.
Here's some advice for you humans
From now on this is our world
No more hiding, no more running away.
If you see us on the road
And you don't like it
Just get the fuck out of my way!
This is where we put down roots
There is nothing that can bind us to anyone anymore.
Have a great day!
