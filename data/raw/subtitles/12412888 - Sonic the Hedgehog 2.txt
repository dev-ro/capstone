[Robotnik] Doctor's log.
It's day 243 in this...
portobello purgatory.
My only companion
is a rock I named Stone.
The question is,
for whom am I narrating this?
[shudders]
It seems I've become a featured
player in the theater of the absurd.
Marooned in deep space
by that wretched blue rodent.
But it's all good,
thanks to a breathable atmosphere
and my supreme intellect,
sharpened against the only
competitor savvy enough to bring it.
Chanterelle to d4. Mmm.
I've been striving to make fungi
into a functional drink of choice...
[sniffs] Mushroom coffee.
[slurps]
[sputters, gags]
With limited...
limited...
[gags, coughs]
limited...
success.
[gasps]
But today, day 243,
has brought a new optimism
to my most pressing endeavor...
Planet us exodus to returnicus
and kick blue butticus.
If my calculations are correct,
and there's no reason to say
"if" because they always are...
this quill is going to power
my masterpiece.
Let's light this candle...
and see who comes
a-knockin'. [Electricity crackling]
[shrieks]
Greetings! [Gasps]
[screaming]
Klaatu barada nikto.
[screams]
[weapons humming]
Agent Stone? Now!
[yells, grunts]
[Robotnik] Thank you, Stone.
It's time to say goodbye to
this piece-of-shiitake planet!
[grunts]
[panting]
Huh?
Where did you get that?
From a little blue menace
on the planet called Earth.
I'd be happy
to show you the way.
[chuckles] Oh.
[engine racing]
[sirens wailing]
They're still on us.
This'll slow 'em down. [Grunts]

Sonic. Are you still in bed?
You're supposed
to meet Tom, remember?
[grunts]
All right, all right,
I'm up! I'm up.
[Tom sighs] What a day.
Whoo!
Thanks for coming out, bud.
You know,
I feel like you and me,
we haven't had
much time together lately.
How's it going over there?
You getting any bites?
[snoring]
[screams] I can't swim! Help!
If I die,

Hey, hey, you're good.
You're all right. Come on.
[shivering] It's freezing.
All right, okay. Take it easy.
[shivering]
All right. You're good. Okay.
But now that you've had
a nap and a bath...
I went up to your room last night to
bring you some new comics and, um...
[Sonic on tape] Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Stop right there.
I wouldn't come any closer,
because this little hedgehog
had way too many chili dogs.
Oh, no. Oh, no. [Farts]
I'm so embarrassed.
Get out of here quick!
Oh, no, here comes another one!
[farts]
Go. Now. Save yourself.
[tape rewinds] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop
right there. I wouldn't come any closer,
[distorting] because this little
hedgehog had way too many chili dogs.
Oh, no. Oh, no. [Farts]
I'm so embarrassed.
Get out of here...
Ugh! I knew I should've
used real farts.
How many times
are we gonna do this?
What? Cast your line and not
catch anything? Seems like a billion.
I think you know
what I'm talking about.
The lying. The sneaking out.
The pretending to be Batman.
Blue Justice, trademark pending.
Whatever. You're being reckless.
Ugh!
Not this conversation again.
Hey. It's no fun for me, either.
But if you keep
being irresponsible,
we're gonna keep
having this conversation.
How is it irresponsible
to use my powers?
Sonic, you destroyed
an entire city block!
That block
was already messed up.
Who cares?
Look, I stopped a robbery.
I was a hero.
No, you put people in danger
and that's not what a hero does.
[sighs] You're supposed
to be my friend.
Stop trying to be my dad.
[sighs]
I can take care of myself.
Sonic, taking care of yourself
is not what being
a hero's all about.
It's about taking
responsibility for other people.
And right now,
whether you want to hear this or not,
you are still just a kid.
You got some more
growing up to do
before you're ready
to be the big hero.
But trust me when I tell you,
there will come a time when
your powers will be needed.
But you don't choose
that moment.
That moment chooses you.
Whoa. Look at you. [Chuckles]
Look at that.
I just got goose bumps.
Wait a second.
Did you steal that from Oprah?
No, sir. That is
a Wachowski family special.
Came from my dad,
in this very boat,
on this very lake.
He would always try and steer me
in the right direction.
And that's what Maddie and I
have always tried to do with you.
So, until your moment arrives,
I want you to work on
being a little more responsible.
Comprende?
Comprende.
High five on it.
Yeah! Donut Lord and the
Blue Blur are back at it again!
Hang on.

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

Oh, yeah! [Chuckles]
Wow. [Laughs]
Welcome to Sonic Air,

Now boarding groups one and two.

Sonic, this is so fun!
I'm sorry, ma'am,
you're group three. Please wait your turn.

Okay, then everybody else

Yes, power bump.
That's more like it.

Okay, use this one

Oh!
All right, we're off. Be good.
Yes. You have our number.
Sorry! Can't hear you! You're traveling
through a cross-dimensional portal!
Miss you already! Okay?
Have fun at Rachel's wedding!
Okay, it's 48 hours

Just a quiet night at home,

And you? What's up with you?
I was just calling
to say we're here.
But now every word out of your
mouth is making me suspicious.
What? You got to relax,

Have a Mai Tai.
Enjoy some time with your wife.

This weekend is about you.
You know what? You're right.
We power-bumped on it.
So whatever it is you're doing,
I'm sure you can undo it
by the time we get home, yeah?
Exactly! I mean,
I am deeply offended by such accusations!
So, how's Rachel's fiancé?
Is he as good-looking in
person as he is in pictures?
Hey, baby.
[sighs] Somehow better-looking.
[Sonic] Wow! You're about to be the
third best-looking dude in the family.
But, hey, still on the podium.

Trouble? Don't worry.

Uh-huh. Night, bud.
Hey! I was just

I should rip you limb from limb.

Oh, my God, look at your face!
Tommy, breathe, baby.
Breathe. I was kidding.
Hey, man,
I was totally kidding. Okay.
You were kidding. Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Rachel put me up to it.
It was totally her idea.
That rascal.
Listen, I don't know

Rachel does not care

Oh, I'm aware. Yeah.

it is an honor to finally meet you,

Is it okay if I call you Sonic?
Everyone calls me Tails.
You're probably wondering why.
Let me guess. Because of
the extra tail? That's right!
I should've known
you'd get that. Cool.
Also, what is going on?
Robotnik's back?
And who is Clifford
the Big Red Rage Monster?
[Tails] That's Knuckles,
the last of the Echidnas
and the most dangerous warrior
in the galaxy.
He's obsessed with finding
the Master Emerald.
[Sonic] Are you serious?
The Master Emerald?
That's just a bedtime story.
Well, he believes it's real.
And he must think
you're the key to finding it.

Hey, what are you...
Move your foot.

I got you off that planet and
you brought me to the hedgehog.
We have no more use
for each other.

I help you retrieve the Emerald,

You're suggesting an alliance.
Around here we simply

Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

You truculent space bumpkin!
You've crushed my favorite hand!
Really? My hand is uninjured.
Ugh.
But I'm now convinced
of your commitment.

nose out the window.

Welcome to the Wade Cave.
Which is something I hope
to someday say to a woman.
A woman who's not my mom.
[chuckles]
Wade, focus.
We need to figure out
why Knuckles thinks
I'm the key to finding
the Master Emerald.
And why did he mention Longclaw?
There must be a connection.
Wait a minute. There is.
Look. There's an emerald symbol
on the map Longclaw gave me.
I never knew
what it meant before.
[Tails] Something's happening.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Longclaw?
Hello, Sonic.
If you're watching this,
then something has happened to me.
And I pray you've made it
to Earth unharmed.
This world has been chosen
for a very important reason.
It's the secret location
of the Master Emerald.
Whoa.
The Emerald has the power
to turn thoughts into reality.
Like the Stay Puft Marshmallow
Man from Ghostbusters.
Shh!
In the wrong hands,
it could threaten
all life in the universe.
Protecting the Emerald
was my sacred duty.
And now I must pass
that responsibility to you.
This is my moment.
Follow the map, find the Emerald,
and keep it safe.
My dear Sonic,
you have a heart like no
creature I've ever known.
I love you so much.
Goodbye.
No, no, wait. [Sighs]
I won't let you down, Longclaw.
So is that y-your dad?
What?
No?
According to this map,
the first clue is in Siberia.
It's a compass that
will lead to the Emerald.
And with Knuckles already here,
it's a race.
Knuckles?
I knew a kid in middle
school named Knuckles.
Could fit his whole fist
in his mouth.
If this is the same Knuckles...
[exhales] ...we are screwed.

We're gonna get there first.

What do you mean, "we"?
You're coming with me.
Oh, no, no, no.
I just came here to warn you.
I'm not a field guy.
Don't worry. I got your back.

Dot, dot, dot.
Dot, dot, dot.
Doctor,
why are we working
with this imbecile?
Because that simpleminded space trash
is the key to something extraordinary.
Something to help you
get revenge on the hedgehog.
Think bigger, Stone.
The emerald he seeks
could power my wildest designs.
My genius wouldn't
just be recognized on Earth.
It would spread virally
to every corner of the galaxy,
allowing me to harness all the
negative forces of the universe
and commune
with Darkness itself.
Wow. That sounds big.
It's been on my vision board for
years. It's the Law of Attraction.
Didn't you see The Secret?
[chuckles]
Kaplooey!
Kaplooey.
"Another boring night at home."
The hedgehog has returned home!
Falsa.
Which is Latin for "wrong-o."
According to my worldwide network
cell tower triangulation, he's lying,
all the way
from the majestic hinterlands
of Eastern Siberia.
He's a long-distance liar!
Kuh! Kuh! Kuh!
Nga-nga-nga-nga-nga!
Yeah, there's more
where that came from.
[Knuckles grunts]
Tiny magic hedgehog destroyed.
Now let's begin our quest.
Wait.
What about your Minion?
The goat milker.
There's no room
on the ship for Stone.
I say we ditch him,
ghost him, blow him off.
Dishonor!
"Dis" is how I roll.
Ugh!
Uh, I'm sorry,
but I asked for the beef stew.
[device speaking Russian]
[speaking Russian]
Uh...
[speaking Russian]
Uh, what's going on?
Maybe they think
it's my birthday?
Don't worry,
I'll take care of this.
Okay, everybody, take it easy.
I'm sure there's
a perfectly good explanation
for whatever my friend said
or did.

There's got to be
something in here.
[Sonic] Tails,

Ooh! I think I got it!
Pivonka! Pivonka!
Pivonka!
Oh? Pivonka?
[crowd murmuring] Pivonka.
Da.
Pivonka!
[all cheering]
Tails, what's a "pivonka"?
It's a Siberian custom
to resolve disputes.
If we win, they let us go.
If we lose...
[both scream]
[shouting]
[shouts in Russian]
Okay, we have to grab the map
and get out of here. Where's the map?
Oh, no. I left it
on the table! Look!
[cheering, applause]
What?
[up-tempo music playing]
[music increases tempo]
[crowd cheering,

Oh, my God, it's a dance fight.
Sonic, what do we do?
We dance and get that map.
Here we go.
[grunts] Ow!

Okay, now let's do... No,
we're gonna go... [grunts]
[grunts] Ah, okay. [Grunts]
Okay, this is not going well.

Wait, Sonic. Look!

You want?
Come get.

Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!
[gasps] What's wrong,
Tails? Come on. I need you!
I can't do this, Sonic.
I'm not brave like you.
My gadget got us in this mess,
and I lost your map,
and we're gonna get
tossed into a fire!
Ah...
New deejay coming in.

Way to go, Tails.
[laughs] Wow.
Only Sonic the Hedgehog
could win a dance battle that epic.
Well, stick with me, pal.
Earth can be a scary place,
but I know everything
about this old pale blue dot.
Do you really mean that?
I mean, not everything. But I watch
a lot of Discovery Channel and...
I meant about me being your pal.
Of course, buddy.
[laughs] Comin' in hot.
Growing up,
I didn't have any friends.
Everyone in my village
thought my two tails were weird.
Hey, I know that feeling.
But then I saw you,
the fastest creature in the galaxy.
You were weird too.
But you were a legend.
That made me think,
maybe being weird isn't so bad.
You inspired me
to leave my village,
to find you and help you
in your mission.
I'm really glad
you're here, Tails.
I'm glad I'm here too, Sonic.
[both yawn]
Well, might as well
get some sleep.
This feels like a good
place to spend the night.
You'll be able to get clear
readings on your gizmo thing
once the storm is over,
so I... [sighs]
[snoring]
Night, Tails.
[yawning]
[gasps]
Tails. Tails. We have
a situation. [Snoring]
[Sonic] Hoo-hoo!
Today's forecast calls for
clear, sunny skies
and a 100% chance of
adventure. [Device beeping]
I pinpointed the coordinates.
It's right up ahead.
[Sonic] Wow.
Hey, Tails. Wait up.
Whoa.
Okay,
we got a giant owl door. Seems encouraging.
[grunts]
Whoa.
[gasps]
Check this out.
Can you translate that?
Uh, yeah.
[Tails] Ages ago,
a fearsome group of warriors,
known as the Echidnas,
forged the Seven Chaos Emeralds
into the most unstoppable
weapon ever created.
The Master Emerald.
With it, a single warrior
could defeat entire armies.
[screams]
[Tails] Believing no one should
have such power,
an order of heroes
recovered the Emerald
and swore to protect it
from evil.
Sounds like
the Owls and the Echidnas
have been fighting
each other for centuries.
Like Vin Diesel and The Rock.
[gasps] Whoa! Wait for me.
Okay, giant owl door,
giant owl. Makes sense.
Whoa.
Wait a second.
I've seen these symbols before.
Here we go.
[rumbling]
Well, that did something.
Whoa! The compass!
This will lead us
to the Emerald!
Hey, you got
a little something on your...
Oh, no. Tails, get back.
Run! [Tails yelps]

Heads up, my little stalagmites.
Someone call an Uber?
Hey, thanks for doing
all the hard stuff.
[grunts]
But we'll take it from here.
Okay, we really gotta talk
about your new look.
It's like Professor X
meets the Monopoly man.
And what kind of genius shows
up to Siberia in a convertible?
The kind of genius
that can turn up the heat...
with a flick of a switch.
[grunts]
Oh! Whoo! [Laughs]
Good one!
I'm sure that wasn't important.
Tails, that's our exit. Come on.

Uh-huh. Let's split up.
You go high, I go low.
Right.

Has anyone ever told you
you've got serious anger issues?
You mock me
with your weak jokes,
but you know nothing
about me, hedgehog.
Well, I know you Echidnas have a habit of
showing up uninvited and ruining my life.
Ruining your life?
Another bad joke.
I lost everything
because of you.
My tribe was on the verge
of its greatest victory.
The last of the Owl warriors
had been located.
Soon Longclaw's Emerald secrets
would be ours.
But my father stopped me
from joining the fight.
He said my moment
to honor our tribe would come,
but it was not this moment.
Those were the last words
he spoke to me.
I never saw him again.
We both lost everything
that day.
[Echidnas yelling]
Goodbye, Sonic. No!
Longclaw!
[groaning]
Sonic! Are you okay?
Deceiver!
No, it wasn't a trick.
Tails, take the compass
and get out of here!
Yeah!
Later, haters!
Tails!
Tails, come on. Wake up.
He chose helping the fox
over pursuing the compass.
Of course he did.
New friend,
same pathetic weakness.
Hmm.

Oh, no. No, no, no.

Okay,

You just gotta picture

So picture this.
Oh, my God. Okay, okay. Hang on.
What?

Oh, God. [Sonic] What? Tell me what "Oh,

when I was teasing Jojo.
What? Where is it then?

right back, I promise.
Please, Randall, it's really important. No,
bro. Go sit down.
Give me the ring, please? Randall,
don't look at him, look at me.
One second.
Put the ring on my finger.
No, Randall, listen to me.
Randall! Look at me.
Ring on my finger.
Give me the ring! Just

You really should have taken me up

It's okay, everyone.
We're federal agents.
You, too, Agent. Go ahead.
You mean to tell me
that this entire wedding was a
setup? Rachel, wait a minute.
What?
That's correct, ma'am.
Every single aspect
of Operation Catfish
was a complete fabrication.
Operation Catfish?
So is everyone here an agent?
Are you an agent?
Son of a...
Was the florist an agent?
How about the photographer?
The woman who waxed my...
at the spa?
Is Jojo an agent?

What?
Rachel, listen to me.
I'm done listening!
I am done listening!
I am so sorry. I am
so sorry. [Sobbing]
I really am. I am so sorry.
No. Hey, no!
Let him go! Hey!
[grunts]
Sonic, hang on.
Take it easy. It's not worth it.
Tom! Ah-ah-ah.
Sonic is not a threat.
He's on our side.
He's an uncontrolled
extraterrestrial.
And your days of aiding
and abetting him are over.
Secure them in the hotel
until the chopper arrives.
You're making a mistake.
[Rachel] Hold on, Major A-hole!
This is still my day,
and someone is gonna explain to
me what the hell is going on here!
After the events
in San Francisco,
a global task force was created,
devoted to protecting
our planet from alien threats.
That day,
Guardian Units of Nations was born.
G-U-N. Seriously? GUN, yeah.
Look, what about protecting
our planet from Dr. Robotnik?
Robotnik is dead.
You're wrong. He's back.
And you just hauled away the
only ones who could stop him.
Sounds like Robotnik
might be back in play.
If he is,
I want him found immediately.
And cancel my five o'clock
at the Olive Garden.
Aunt Maddie? Yeah.
Sonic and his friend
dropped this.
[gadgets beeping]
I have an idea.
And I want to have
a word with my fiancé.
And that word is "murder."
[Sonic] Hey, come on.
You can't just leave us in here.
My friend is hurt! He needs a doctor,
a vet, anyone!
Tails,
you got to wake up, buddy.
Please wake up.
[children chattering, laughing]
[police radio chatter]
All clear.
All right. Game plan.
I get inside the hotel and find
where they're hiding Tom and Sonic.
Okay.
Then I find Randall, right?
And then I squeeze the breath
from his lying, deceitful,
perfectly manscaped body!
[cackles]
I'm going through
a lot right now.
So let me process this
my own way, okay?
Sure, sure.
No judgment. Should've
brought a journal.
Okay...
Okay. Is this meant to be a
weapon? This is adorable.
Pew, pew! Take that, Randall!

Run, Randall!
All right.
We're about to
find out. All right!

Huddle up.

Together.
There's no time for that.
I'm the only one
that can get there fast enough.
Sonic, this is way too big
for you to do by yourself.
You see that little fox
over there?
He came all the way across
the universe to meet his hero.
And what did his hero do?
I practically got him killed.
You know what? You were right.
My moment came and I blew it.
I'm no hero.
Wait. [Sonic] No.

are open, honest

Because you saved me first,

advantage I do not understand.
It wasn't a tactic.
I couldn't just let you die.
Why?
I've been trying to destroy
you since the moment we met.
Because being a hero isn't
about taking care of yourself.
It's about taking responsibility
for other people.
Hmm. Wise words.

No, sir, that's

And again. And again.
Okay, I didn't fail that much.
But I didn't do this all alone.
I found a new family.
New friends.
And you can too.
You don't have to be
alone anymore.
[bones cracking]
[Sonic] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Are you kidding me
with that handshake?
[Wade] I'm done
playing games, pal.
You're gonna tell me
what I want to know.
And I am asking you
for the last time...
what would you like
on your bagel?
I'm not telling you anything.
And that is a display bagel.
I don't get it with you!
I mean, I've tried everything.
I was good cop. I was bad cop.
I was cop
who offers you a bagel.
And nothing. It's like...
That is a display bagel. Wow.
[rumbling]
[electronic warbling]
[yells]
Doctor, you're here.
[in electronic voice] Yes,
I'm here, and yet I'm...
not all there.
Sir, are you feeling okay?
I'm more than okay.
I'm upgraded.
[singsongy] Sinister 3.0.
My game is next level.
[warped vocalizing]
Hi. [Screams]
I can smell the electricity
in your brain.
[sniffs]
You smell like a snack plate.
Yeah, no, that's fair.
I had a couple today.
Sit down.
In the chair.
I didn't know.
'Cause he was in the chair,
so I didn't... Okay.
Sir? We have a problem.
[soldier 1] All teams in position!
[soldier] Set up a perimeter!
[soldier] Move! Move! Move!
In correct us, my trusty barnacle.
After all these years,
what I finally got...
is a solution.
Commander. Status report.
Robotnik is in there with Stone
and a hostage. Possibly local PD.
I'm not saying he's dumb,
but if he is local PD,
this town's in a lot of trouble.
[both] Wade.
Um...
Okay.
Rockin' that new
spring collection, I see.
Well, if it isn't
the Pastry King.
The Donut Lord.
A real genius would remember
the name of the guy
who helped kick your butt
off this planet.
And I'll do it again
if you mess with Green Hills.
Congratulations on your
oh-so-temporary sense of superiority.
You're finished, Robotnik!
We've taken everything.
Your lab, your drones,
your funding!
Let's see how big of a man you
are without your silly little robots.
Would you like to see how...
big a man I can be?
Welcome to the new norm.
My God!
Doctor! Take me with you!
[screaming]
[train horn blowing]
He's taking everything apart.
He's building something.
[Tails]
That can only be one thing.
The fearsome power
of the Emerald.
If that thing really
turns thoughts into power,
we are in big trouble.
Robotnik has a lot
of bad thoughts.
Hey, Sonic, are you sure
it was a good idea
bringing you-know-who aboard?
Knuckles isn't really a bad guy.
He's just a little mixed up.
I am not mixed up!
I have steely focus.
And I'm complex.
And that's a lot
for some people.
[chuckles] Hope you're not
still mad I hit you with that car.
Pfft!
I was completely uninjured.
And my revenge will come
when you least expect it, fox.
Whoa.
Sir, you're magnificent!
Thank you, sycophant.
Your admiration is inevitable.
I knew it!
Just like the Stay Puft
Marshmallow Man.
World Domination play list.
[heavy metal playing]
Fall back.
Fall back! Quick! Retreat!
How are we supposed
to beat this thing?
We need a plan.
Knuckles, use your strength to...
Jump off the plane. Wow.
Okay, this is what we're
gonna do. Step 1: Light taunting.
Step 2: I have no idea.
Sonic!
[Sonic]
Nice action figure, Eggman.
Does it do anything or just
stand there looking ugly?
Like a blister,
he keeps coming back!
He's on the okay-to-kill list. Shoot
the missiles. Make a decision.
I need a moment, sir. I'm
trying to figure out how to do this.
Did you even glance at a manual?
No! I'll do it.
Pardon my lightning.
You might want to
ground yourself. [Groaning]
Uh-oh.
I'm gonna pop that thing open
like a can of chili... [screams]
[Sonic] Whoa!
[Tails] Hang on!
Whoa!
[grunting]
Whoa! [Laughs]
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
Oh,
yeah! Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Close one.
[Sonic grunts] Sonic!
Robotnik!
Deceiver!
Die, mosquito.
[panting]
[grunting]
[yells]
Ooh! I felt that.
[growling]
Oh! Whoa!
What just happened?
It's the Stache Masher.
Right here in the manual.
Return to sender.
[Robotnik, Stone grunt]
Stone?
Oh, great.
Next thing you know, there'll be a
report about a hostile work environment.
Those were our best attacks,
and they did nothing!
We can't beat Robotnik as
long as he's got that Emerald.
He's too powerful.
Look, we aren't strong enough
to beat Robotnik on our own.
But there's three of us.
Your strength, your smarts
and my speed.
Together. That's how we win.
So we make our stand here
on the field of battle.
As a team.
This is it.
This is our moment.
Time to fight.
Bad time to say this,
but I don't actually have a plan.
Tails, any ideas?
We have to find his weak spot.
I suggest the groin.
What? No. No!
Traditionally, yes,
the groin is the weakest spot.
Stop saying "groin."
[Robotnik] Hedgehog!
Look out!
I know what his
weak spot is. It's me.
I'm the groin!
[Knuckles grunts]
Think about it. Whoa!
I live rent-free
in this dude's head.
So if I go out there
and rile him up...
He'll focus on only you,
leaving himself open
to a flanking maneuver
from me and the fox!
Hedgehog,
you are a brave and noble warrior.
Go to your certain death
with honor.
We're gonna have to work
on your pep talks, pal.
[laughs] Yeah. Let's go.
All right, mustache.
You want me? Come and get me.
You don't tell me
about coming and getting.
I am on the cutting edge
of coming and getting!
Coming, getting.
Coming, getting. Coming,
getting. Coming, getting.
Oh, you're really heavy.
That's because I am one million
percent muscle. Faster, fox!
Go! Move, guys! Move back! Let's go,
that's it! Go, go, go!
Keep going! Go! Go!
No, no! Stop! Stop the truck!
Tom, what happened here?
You thinking what I'm
thinking? Let's get our kid.
[both] We need your truck!
[voice slowing] Coming,
getting. Whew!
[Sonic] Yoo-hoo!
So what's the
plan here? [Panting]
Huh?
You gonna build
a big robot house?
Get yourself a big robot wife?
I'm going to enslave humanity and
force them to service my machines.
First, Green Hills.
Then the universe.
Then the multiverse.
Then who knows?
Maybe that'll be enough.
Full disclosure?
You won't be there.
[grunts] Eye lasers? Really?
[panting]
Snot rocket!
No, no, no!
[screaming]
[grunts]
[laughing] Giving up already?
Not so tough when you're fighting
someone 700 times your size, are ya?
You can't beat me!
I'm all-powerful! All-knowing!
All-seeing.
Looks like your fancy robot
has a glitch.
[voice multiplying] Is it me?
What about me? I'm over here.
Up top! Down below!
Behind you! [Laughs]
[voices overlapping] I'm
over here. Sorry! Over here.
Too slow! Try again.
You can't outsmart me.
Missed me again.
I'm the out smarter-er!
[grunts]
[yelping]
I didn't outsmart you.
I'm just the distraction.
[Knuckles] Robotnik!
I am also a hologram.
Disloyal.
"Dis" is how I roll.
[yells]
[Robotnik groaning]
[both screaming]
[both grunting]
[gasping]
Where's my Emerald?
No, no, no, no!
Computer, auxiliary power.
[groans]
[gasps] Oh.
The Emerald. It's right there.
Move, you hunk of junk!
I have to... [groans] reach it.
[groaning]
[grunts]
Come on.
There he is! Go! Go, go, go!
[Maddie yelling]
No!
We got you, Sonic.
Hold on!
[all panting]
You guys okay?
[Tom grunts] Yeah.
Okay.
I got the Emerald.
We could still defeat him.
Come on, come on. How does
this thing work? What do I do?
[cracking]
What?
No. No, no, no!
Look at the happy little family.
You have to get away from
me. I'm the one he wants.
Hey.
We're not going anywhere.
We're family.
And families stick together...
no matter what.
I love you guys.
We love you too, Sonic.
[chaos emeralds chiming]
No!
I got him!
I finally got him! [Cackles]
[thudding]
What was that?
[gasps]
[yelps]
[panting]
It's over, Eggman.
[chuckles] I like the
new look. It works for you.
What do you say
we just let bygones be bygones?
I did some things,
you did some things.
There are good people
on both sides.
Surely two intelligent beings
can work these things out!
[grunts]
Come on, buddy.
Get him, Sonic! Come on.
Yeah. Come on.
[gasping]
It's like that?
Okay, we're not friends.
Later, hater!
Sonic! Buddy! [Laughs]
Wait! You cannot touch him!
The hedgehog holds
the power of the Emerald.
I am sorry. He is no longer
the Sonic you once knew.
What?
[sniffs]
Mmm.
Oh, you got to try this.
Okay. He is exactly
the Sonic you once knew.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Sonic! Whoa!
Bring it in, bud.
It's good to be back in blue.
The golden god thing was fun,
but blue has always been more my color.
Looks good on you.
Sonic, you were
the most powerful hero
in the universe,
and you let it go.
Why?
Because I still have
some growing up to do.
And I kind of like being a kid.
And you're not just any kid.
You're our kid.
That's right.
Bring it in! [Tails] Yay. Hugs.
It's a good thing we didn't do
this before. You would've blown up.
[Sonic] Whoa! You fixed it.
I've spent my whole life
questing for this.
Now I have it.
Now we have it.
What do we do with it?
What next?
There were once
two orders of heroes
who protected the galaxy from those
who would use the Emerald for evil.
But they have all passed on to
the great battleground in the sky.
So we start a new order.
The three of us.
This is no light task.
We must make a vow to use our
powers to keep the universe safe,
to watch out for each other.
Our new tribe.
Oh, I know!
A power bump!
Good idea.
It's an Earth custom.
An unbreakable promise.
Very well.
A power bump it is.
Power bump!
[Sonic over PA]
It's truly a beautiful day
for baseball here
in Green Hills.
An exciting lineup today
with the debut appearance
of two new players!
On the mound,
rookie sensation from across the galaxy,
Miles "Tails" Prower,
facing off against the powerhouse,
Knuckles the Echidna.
Um, I don't understand.
Why am I angry
at the enemy ball?
You're not angry.
You just want to hit it
as hard as you can
and then run around the bases.
But if my quest ends
where I am standing,
why run at all?
Ugh. I can't with this guy.
Why do I even try?
This is just a game.
We're out here having fun.
Just having some fun.
Fun. Huh.
All right!
Give him the heat, Tails!
Hope you're ready
for my fastball.
Your fastball
will be dishonored.
And so will you, fox. [Grunts]
Easy, guys!
Don't think about it too much.
Just keep your elbow up,
eye on the ball
and give it a ride.
A ride? To where?
[grunts]
[growls]
Power bump!
[screams]
Ha! Victory is mine!
Hey, no fair!
That shouldn't count.
First base is also mine!
I think that was our
only ball. [Laughs]
I have conquered
the second of the bases!
Who wants ice cream?
Knocked the cover off that.
Ice cream! Ice cream, yeah!
[laughing] I am having
the fun! What is ice cream?
It's a dessert. If you like fun,
you're gonna love it.
Oh, yum. Dessert.
Does it have grapes in it?
No, not usually.
I'm proud of our little guy.
I really like his new friends,
especially the red one.
He cracks me up.
Heck of a swing too.
Come on, fox.
Our dessert adventure
awaits. Whoo!
Good job, guys. Yeah.
You too, baby.
Let's go get some ice cream.
Come on, come on.
I'm happy for you, pal.
Got your wing men.
Perfect friends to grow up with.
Come on,
Knuckles. Ah! My victory chariot!
I've got a lot more
than that... Dad.
Race you to the truck.
One, two, three, go!
No, don't go easy on me.
I want your best.
Sonic, I have just been told
they have sprinkles.
Ice cream and sprinkles?
This is your new destiny.
What a perfect meal to celebrate
my victory over you in base of ball.
What? I mean,
you barely beat me.
Ha! You've never been
beaten so hard.
[Sonic laughs]
Can't forget this.

Agent, I want an update.
Still searching,
sir. We haven't found any sign of Robotnik.
No one could've
survived that crash.
He's toast. Good riddance.
What a mess that lunatic made.
Sir, there's something else.
When we were wiping Robotnik off
our database, we found something.
A file buried deep in our system
and dating back over 50 years.
What was it?
Coordinates, sir.
Coordinates? To what?
[agent]
A secret research facility.
It was a black site, sir.
Someone worked very hard
to keep this hidden.
[commander] My God.
Project Shadow.
