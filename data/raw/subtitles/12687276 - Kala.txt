[Long, long, long ago]
'Wild! Wild!
Wild! Wild!'
'Wild! Wild!
Wild! Wild!'
'Wild is me!'
'Wild is you!'
'Wild is everything!'
'Wild! Wild!
Wild! Wild!'
'Wild! Wild!
Wild! Wild!'
'Wild is me!'
'Wild is you!'
'Wild is everything!'
'What's life without nature!'
'An end to pain!'
'You are the destiny!'
'You are the destruction!'
'Wild! Wild!
Wild! Wild!'
'Wild! Wild!
Wild! Wild!'
'The hunted and the hunter,
are two halves of your gamble.'
'The one who crawls,
and the one who flies,
are served equal justice
in your eyes.'
'As long as I have your
sphere of protection,
I have no fear to spill blood'
'One decision.'
'A blessed life.'
'Finally, a fall.'
'Uniting in death!'
Dad, hands up!
Appoos, come and have Horlicks!
Vidya!
Vidya!
Vidya, switch off the motor.
Vidya!
- Yeah, I heard you!
Switch off the motor!
- Ask him to drink Horlicks.
Didn't you drink Horlicks?
Go, drink it..
- Hands up!
Get going!
Dad, Blackie is running away!
Shaji, go fast.
- Hey!
The stray dogs have given birth to
big bunch of puppies at the field.
Blackie!
- Blackie will attack and kill them!
Blackie?
Blackie?
Blackie!
Blackie?
Blackie?
[Dog barking]
[Dog barking]
Come on.
Get inside.
Dad, bring him here.
This is his pace.
Not 'pace'.
It's place!
Why are you locking Blackie
up over there? Let him open.
And you want your grandpa to
create a ruckus over here?
If his hair falls over here,
grandpa will go short of breath!
When will grandpa
be cured from that?
I don't think he will
be cured anytime soon.
Sheesh! Why are you crying?
Come here.
Boys shouldn't cry!
If you wanted it, you should
have fought with me and taken it.
Didn't we watch a movie
at Palakkad the other day?
Yes, in an AC theatre.
'Jagannadhan'
You should hit like that.
But Jagannadhan
couldn't aim properly.
His spear never hit
the target either.
But this Jagannadhan
is stinking now.
Don't you want to have a bath?
- No.
Why?
- I am upset with you, dad.
For what?
You give a bath to
both Blackie and mom.
You never give me a bath.
Who told this to you?
I heard you telling mom.
Oh no! Don't spin me!
Oh no! The house is spinning!
Dad, is this your house
or grandpa's house?
Dad's house. No doubt about it.
Haven't you seen on the gate?
Shaji 'Nivas' (House).
But mom said that this
is grandpa's house!
[Car horn]
Park it over there.
Hands up, grandpa!
Drive properly.
- Appu, come here.
You got back last night, is it?
What about the thing you went for?
Did you hire him again?
I've given you many
second chances, right?
Consider this also like that.
Anyway, don't leave cash in
the dashboard again.
You also wasted a lot of money
in the name of doing business, right?
5000 Rupees is
nothing compared to that.
See you.
I'll shoot down these jack fruits.
Yeah, right.
Stop!
Come here, you...
It's a sweet, firm fleshed one.
It had fallen down.
Half was bitten by birds,
but it's still superb.
So I thought I'll
take 10-20 pieces.
Dad likes it a lot.
What happened?
You seem upset.
Dad just keeps blabbering...
Come here, Appu.
- No.
Here.
Go, give this to grandpa.
'Appu's grandpa!'
If that upsets you, imagine my plight! I
should have fled from here long back then.
Your dad is really frustrated.
He was taunting me a
lot ever since you left.
That's why I thought
I'll go home.
Dad talks as if I forced you
to do farming at Attappadi.
Let 2 days pass.
Please. Take me home tomorrow itself.
Mathappoo is there now.
Tomorrow is the 25th, right?
It's dad's check-up date.
If I come to drop you,
he'll vent all his anger
on you, when you come back.
Do you want that?
I'll take you home
some other day.
If you don't have time, call
Ani and ask him to drop me home.
Ani has come there earlier, right?
You didn't even turn
up for Ramya's wedding.
I had gone to check out
the land at Attappadi then, right?
And my vehicle broke down too.
Call your dad and ask him
to send Sudhiyettan here.
Oh yeah! I just remembered.
Aunt Meena had called.
To ask about Vinu's
admission in Bangalore.
The money is ready apparently.
I had told her that you had
gone to Bangalore, Shaji.
I said that I'll call
her once you're back.
Won't he get admission in our college?
Isn't it okay?
It is okay!
[Dog barking]
Shall we pluck the arecanuts?
Do it after one week.
Don't delay it.
Once it starts raining,
we can't climb.
Let's do it.
Looks like it will
be sunny tomorrow.
I have to go to the hospital
tomorrow. Let that be done.
I'm here, right?
We can call Tamilian workers.
They work for lesser wages.
Velu and his boys
have gone somewhere.
Call just 3 or 4 people.
- Okay.
It's okay.
What happened?
Ghost!
Ghost?
Where?
Near the well.
Near the well?
- Yes.
Son, that is Mani Aashan.
Mani Aashan just
dresses up as the Ghost.
The Ghost catches only bad kids.
Are you a bad kid?
- No.
Then what's the problem?
Minister Pinarayi
Vijayan said that
the electricity charges need
not be increased in Kerala.
All time record price for pepper.
French Open tennis
tournament begins tomorrow.
Has he slept?
Yes.
It's been 2 days since
he slept properly.
He was with the colouring book
that Jithu gave, day and night.
He draws quite well.
Look! He has drawn you
as an angel with a gun.
He might do well if
we give him a push.
He's my son, after all.
Shaji, I've called Ani and told him...
... about dropping me home.
Why?
Sudhi won't come?
I had called my brother first.
But since he's getting a fresh
load at his shop tomorrow,
he said he can't come.
He's busy tomorrow.
That's why I called Ani.
He is free tomorrow.
Looks like it will rain heavily.
Tomorrow there will be
workers at the field too.
Just 2 days.
I'll go and come back soon.
I need a break.
If I stay here in this mindset,
I'll be even more disturbed.
I'll just go quickly,
get refreshed and come back.
The workers will
need food tomorrow.
Prepare that before you leave.
- Okay.
I missed this.
For the past 3 days.
If this admissions plan works out,
shall we shift to Bangalore?
I can give tuitions.
Appu will get better education too.
No.
It won't be right if
we shift from here now.
Why?
Then dad will tell everyone that we
left him alone in his old age.
Shaji...
Don't take dad's harsh
behaviour to your heart.
He's quite old, right?
A character change at this age,
is not practical.
His main problem is that I bought
the land with your dad's money,
without listening to him.
Just that he's not saying it out.
And that flopped big time as well.
When dad called, he said he's
selling all the pepper in the house.
We can't predict how the
market is going to be.
He said that if there's another
war, prices will definitely go down.
It will be foolish to
wait till 2000 apparently.
What are you thinking?
You changed the subject so beautifully.
My treasure!
You are my treasure!
Don't eat it all at once.
Your teeth will decay.
Will Blackie's teeth decay too?
He's not supposed to eat this.
There are bones for him.
Hey!
You remember that we have to
go for my check-up, right?
Yes.
She wants to go to her
house with Appu today.
It's been long, right?
I've called Ani.
He will come.
He will drop them.
But when the workers come,
if there's no one here...
No need.
Manu will come.
I will go with him.
I have to go to the bank as well.
It will take some time.
Has Lalitha Chechi come?
- No.
It's not time yet.
Ask her to cook the
chicken with bell pepper.
Hey!
Peel those onions, please.
['Vaan Megham' from Punnagai
Mannan plays on tape recorder]
Do you have to go today?
Shaji, you know how difficult it was for
me to take this decision, right?
Please support that decision.
I need that support.
You have my support.
But I'll be alone here.
Go and come back soon.
Such magical weather, right?
Shall I smoke a cigarette here?
Dad won't come here.
Not now.
There are people outside.
There's light all around.
Do we have pineapple here?
- Yes.
Have it!
Was your dad always
like this to you, Shaji?
Shaji!
Who's that?
You've made that
place all dirty.
There's an orange inside
the cupboard in my room.
Is it 9 o'clock?
It's 9:10 AM.
Oops.
Oh! You're here, Chechi?
I got a little late.
Aren't you going today?
I'll leave at 10:30.
There are cobwebs on the window sills.
Please clean them.
Sister...
Shall I take this iron bar?
Okay.
Chechi, please have an
eye on the things outside.
[Ravi crying in pain]
Vidya!
What happened?
- Dad...
Dad!
Slowly...
I felt like someone suddenly
pushed me from behind.
Gently...
Who's going to push you?
You just might have felt so.
I said what I felt.
Gently...
Son, go and bring grandpa's
spectacles. - Okay.
Where are these workers from?
Many of them have
landed at Patthirippala.
They do all the chores outside
the houses, in the town now.
They charge less too.
Dad, shall we plant Robusta
bananas at Chammala fields?
Good quality seeds
are available now.
Reji deals with that now.
Shall I do it?
I heard that the
yield is good now.
Dad?
Get the title deed ready and sell
that land for whatever price you get,
and deposit the money
in her account first.
What is it?
Didn't I ask you to tie a
net under that coconut tree?
What's the point in telling you?
He never listens to what I say.
Mani!
Hey Mani!
- Chechi, give this to them.
Mani!
- Let them eat.
Yes.
What is it, Raviyetta?
One of the roof tiles in the
kitchen has to be changed.
There will be some left at the shed, right?
- Yes.
Take that.
And yeah, when you go,
tie a net under that coconut tree.
Sathyan, ask that Tamilian guy to
get 3-4 roof tiles from that shed.
Take the ladder as well.
Maniyetta, have some tea and go.
Wait. I have some work.
- To change the roof tile, right?
It's not going to rain now.
Why should you hurry then?
- Okay. Let me see.
It's 10 o'clock.
Hey!
You can do it after having tea.
Call all of them.
What about yesterday's chicken curry?
- It's over.
Do you have the oil
that you applied on dad?
Shut up!
Hey brother.
Where are you from?
Naickerpadi. You?
We both are from Kuniyampathoor.
Brother!
Where do I dump this?
Dump it under that coconut tree.
Hey! Hey!
Go and change that roof tile
after washing your hands.
The roof tile!
Who am I saying this to?
Where is Appu?
He's outside, dad.
He's playing with Blackie.
Bring him inside.
Playing, it seems!
I've come at the right time, huh?
Come, sit down.
Have some food.
No, dude.
I had breakfast from home.
I can have some tea though.
You have a check-up today, dad?
Yes.
Manu said he will come,
but he isn't here yet.
Manu is outside.
Is he here?
Why can't he say that he has reached?
That's quite a lot!
Dad...
What should I do about
those Robusta bananas?
Reji had called day
before yesterday too.
Must be to ask about this.
- What is it? Farming?
Is it one of your
experiments like earlier?
Are you planning to waste
your dad's money again?
What's your problem, you fucker?
Hey! What is this?
I'll come to your house and return your
money today evening or tomorrow morning.
Don't come to my
house and mock me, you fucker.
I'm already pissed off here.
Everyone has their own needs.
You should understand that.
You're not the only one in this world.
This behaviour of yours.
It's not right.
You've been saying
that you'll repay...
Ani, I'll come in ten minutes.
Yeah. Take your time.
Hey! Are you listening to me?
I'll give it, man.
Chechi...
We are leaving.
- Be really naughty over there.
Chechi, before you go, please serve
the food for Shaji and the workers.
Okay, dear.
Uncle Ani, did you see
my new Tom & Jerry bag?
Is it new?
- Yes.
You're so smart.
We're ready, Ani.
Come.
Blackie, we are leaving.
Tell Blackie that
we'll be back in 2 days.
Blackie, we'll be back
in two days, okay?
Check the air of the back tyre.
Shaji...
Blackie, we'll be back
in two days, okay?
Check the air of the back tyre.
- Shaji!
Yes, coming!
And I need your
pick up truck's key.
I have to send the
arecanuts before it rains.
Look!
Shaji, there's no problem here, right?
It's just my imagination, right?
Tell me that it's all the
fear within me, Shaji.
There's no problem here.
Go and come back happily.
Bye bye, Blackie.
Stop howling and climb
the next areca palm.
Gaping over there?
Got scared?
Yes, a little.
By the way...
Where are these workers from?
They are Tamilians.
One of them is from
Attappadi, I guess.
Is Attappadi in
Kerala or Tamil Nadu?
Who knows!
The other one is my sister's son.
Sathyan. He has also joined us.
Okay.
Just like you asked...
All of them look quite creepy.
I hand-picked them.
Shall we start then?
It's not the right time yet.
Let Lalitha leave.
She might tell Dad.
Then I'll climb two
more palms and come.
Come on.
Hello?
- This is Jithen. When did you reach?
Yes, Advocate.
I reached last night.
What about the thing you went for?
It didn't happen.
You know what will happen if you
don't settle it this week, right?
You'll go behind bars!
We need to go to
Thiruvananthapuram.
What?
- Can I get some water?
Okay.
You'll have to spend some money!
But you can become free.
Hello?
Here you go.
- Shaji!
Save it up. It will be needed later.
- What?
Hello? Shaji?
Shaji?
I'll call you back, Advocate.
You...!!!
What's your problem, fucker?
Didn't you get a bigger one?
No. I got only this.
Okay. I'll clean it.
You load this stuff.
Okay.
Bau!
Bau!
What is it?
Were you trying to steal something?
Don't worry.
I will not call the police.
Tell me.
Tell me, kiddo.
I have a lot of work to do.
I have to finish all that,
after this.
Are you tongue-tied now, you swine?
If you're not planning to say it,
you'll lie here.
I'll beat you to death like a dog.
And I'll bury you at some
corner of this field.
No one's going to
question me!
That boy was with
the hooch brewer Velangan.
I sensed something wrong when I
heard that he was from Attappadi.
I have seen him earlier.
It was his dog that died when you
burst that local bomb at the estate.
He has come to take
revenge for that.
He had gone to Paul first.
He beat him to pulp apparently.
For killing a dog?
How many of them were there?
This boy was alone.
And finally, Paul said your name.
All the liabilities of joint
farming are upon me now, is it?
You fucker!
This is not about joint farming.
This is your recklessness.
Yours alone.
Then who instigated me?
Your dad?
It's wild buffalo meat.
Caught by real hunters!
- It's a piglet!
These tribals whom
you call brainless?
They are much
smarter in hunting!
Electric shocks and local bombs...
didn't even touch the pig's hair!
Your experiments are impressive, Shaji.
But... nothing is working out.
Bau!
Bau!
All that meat is getting wasted!
Paid all the money he
had and bought this land.
Did farming which he
had no clue about!
At least hire someone
who knows the job!
Or pack your bags and give everything
to the pigs here and leave!
He's really violent.
Their people say that
God has possessed him.
He is a lunatic.
He's just acting like a lunatic.
I had also acted like one,
when I failed my pre degree course.
I'll deal with this.
No problem as yet, right?
No problem. I beat him up and
locked him up in the shed.
Hey!
Where the hell were you?
Roaming around without
doing any work?
If you roam around and stretch your hand in
the evening, I won't give a single penny!
The vigour your showed to ask for work?
Show that in your work!
And yeah!
If you do the work
you're asked to do,
I'll pay you in the evening.
Or go do whatever job you like.
There are only 5-6 areca palms.
And they are lazing around.
Go and do your work!
- Maniyetta, come and have food.
Sathyan!
Hey!
Yes!
- Did you see my watch?
No, Uncle.
It's 1:30 PM, Aashaan.
Come on.
Come and have lunch.
It will be 4:30 PM by the time it's done.
Then you can have tea as well.
Come fast.
I have to invite you or what?
Can't you hear me?
Come and have food.
That will take another
hour and a half.
Did someone run this way?
- Who?
I must have imagined it then.
Shall I leave, son?
- Okay.
'The son of this family, born in the
star 'Karthika', with the name Shaji.'
'The son of this family, born in the
star 'Karthika', with the name Shaji.'
Sathyan...
This was the land where my
grandfather and Uncle Kelu used to stay.
These guys usurped it from us.
We've become good for
nothings, right Uncle?
'All your sufferings and
distress should end'
'All your sins should be absolved'
'All your sufferings and
distress should end'
When there was a
conflict in between,
the scar from an attack from my father,
is still on Ravi's face.
What are you saying?
Long, long ago...
... all this land was ours!
Long, long ago means?
Eat!
Have your food!
Those who came in like this,
vanquished us and left.
What's happening, Aashan?
Is it done yet?
- Almost.
Has Lalitha left?
Yes.
Shall we start then?
Why do you always lock him up?
Set him free. Let him run around.
No.
What's his breed?
Cane Corso.
- What?
Cane Corso.
Whatever said and done,
there's only one being that gives back
double the love that we give them.
Dogs!
I have one at home.
A local breed.
We don't tie him up. He's always free.
This one's not local.
He's foreign.
It's a rich breed. So he has
to be treated differently.
So, shall I...?
You go have food.
We already had food.
Did everyone eat?
No.
There's a small problem.
Come there with the key.
I'll tell you.
Sathyan!
- Yes!
Climb on 10 more palms.
I'll send these guys back soon.
There's some other work.
Okay, Uncle.
- [in Tamil] Get down!
[in Tamil] You have other work.
Come on!
Shaji!
That's quite a lot.
Let's take 8 sacks
for the time being.
Caught him red-handed.
I slapped him as
soon as I caught him.
He ran away.
Bloody thief.
When they come looking for work,
how can I identify their characters?
Each one is a different type.
Anyway, I got my watch back.
Hey! Hold this.
We trust these guys and bring them.
And they end up messing with us!
Make it fast!
Stop admiring it and go
load it into the vehicle.
He's admiring its beauty!
Fill it quickly!
Kiddo... that day.... I
didn't do it deliberately.
It just happened so,
because I was drunk.
I can understand your emotion.
I'll buy a new dog for you.
I will kill your dog.
I'll buy a better dog for you.
A Dobermann or an Alsatian...
It was a local dog
that died, right?
I'll buy an awesome dog for you.
Try to understand.
I didn't do it deliberately.
I will kill your dog before
I finish my work here.
For that, I have to
die first, you fucker!
Come fast!
Come on!
Shaji!
Who's that?
What's that sound? Come fast.
Shaji, come fast!
- Come fast!
Sathyan!
Sathyan!
Son... Sathyan!
Hey!
- Hey! Get up!
Oh God!
What is this!
Sathyan!
- Sathyan!
Shaji!
You'll be alright, son.
Where does it hurt?
Sathyan!
Shaji, start the vehicle.
Let's take him to the hospital.
Come and help him up.
Hold his hands.
Shaji, start the vehicle.
Let's take him to the hospital.
Aashan, why don't we
take him to the hospital,
after loading the
rest of the pepper?
You know what will happen if
dad sees it lying here, right?
What the fuck are you saying?
Is your pepper more important
to you than someone's life?
Give me the key.
I will take him.
Shaji, don't complicate things.
If he dies here,
it is only my loss.
Give me the key.
- Hold him!
Hold him!
You'll be alright, son.
You are fine.
Shall we go?
Wait.
Shall we go?
- Wait.
What happened?
- Wait.
What is it?
- Wait.
Aashaan...
It will only take 10-15 minutes.
He will die before that.
Get down!
He's sitting here without doing any work.
Get down!
Hey! Load all the pepper
before it rains.
Let's go!
Shaji, I don't have
another option, boy!
Son of a bitch, can't you
understand what I'm saying?
You've been messing around
ever since you came here.
Let me sort this out. I'll buy you
a dog or cat or whatever you want.
Now don't get beaten up again.
Go home.
Tell me if you need bus fare.
I'll give you.
What gives you the
courage to mess with me?
Come on!
Didn't I tell you decently
first, you fucker?
But you want my dog then!
I'm not going to give
you a dog now, you cunt!
Now I will decide when
you will leave from here.
What happened?
Why did you come back?
What's the problem?
There's no problem.
What is this?
- It's nothing. I was working in the field.
The door is open. You go inside.
- Did you apply medicine?
I'll come. You go first.
What's the matter?
It's nothing.
On our way there,
we saw an accident happening.
Both Vidya and the child got
really scared seeing that.
We went a little further after that.
But she said let's go back,
and we came back.
What happened?
It's nothing.
A pig entered the field.
You're not hurt, right?
No. I beat it to death and buried it.
That's when this happened.
Where is my pick-up truck?
Mani has taken it.
He will bring it
back in some time.
You can take my car now. I'll bring
your vehicle home in the evening.
You should settle my cash in the evening.
- I'll give it.
Leave!
You will do it only if I say it like this.
That's why.
And then, the problem.
That's in your eyes!
I'm serious.
This blood smells different.
You smell different too!
You got really scared, is it?
Can you give me a hug?
This is common on the roads, right?
Firstly, that turning
is fresh in my memory.
We had skidded there during the
time when Appu was conceived.
It was a young boy.
And there was blood
all over the road.
Appu got really scared.
How can people hit someone
and go without stopping?
You take rest for some time.
Will you take him with you?
Let me lie down for a while.
Won't you sit here watching
Uncle Jackie's fights?
Okay.
Hey!
I'll throw this rope.
Climb up!
Hey kiddo!
Come on up!
I won't hurt you!
When I came to save you,
you're being a prick again?
Even when I kept
on holding back...
you want your damn revenge?
I lied that I killed your
dog because I was drunk.
I got a great high
when I killed it.
Die, you fucker!
What the fuck do you want?
I want that 'high'
you spoke about!
For that, I have to die,
you Nigger!
[Mani Aashan : Load all the
pepper before it rains, okay?]
You...!!
[car horn]
You're here?
Where the hell were you?
I was at the field.
Got your leg bandaged?
Does it hurt?
What happened here?
I saw Mani at the hospital.
What happened to that worker?
Didn't you hear me?
Dad...
Some of the pepper which was
in our shed is missing now.
Missing?
Say it clearly.
The Tamilian workers
shifted it somewhere else.
I had a doubt and whacked them.
One of them fell unconscious.
But... where is the pepper now?
I was looking for it. I have no
idea where they shifted it to.
Why the hell weren't
you watching them?
Vidya and Appu came
back, in between that.
Some accident on the road.
You went into the
room when she came.
And those guys stole
my stuff in that gap.
It's not like that, dad.
Why do you care if I
lose my pepper, right?
It costs around 2.5 Lakhs.
I should have asked that dog to guard it,
instead of you.
Dad!
Leave me!
Go and find my stuff!
You also go with him!
You can leave.
I can do this myself.
Don't worry.
I haven't told
your dad anything.
Close the gate when you go.
You've tried to secure the
power of the armour of God.
Such a God must be very powerful.
What is the name of your God?
My God is more powerful than
you could possibly imagine.
My God's name is...
.... money!
I have a doubt whether Mani
Aashan is also involved in this.
Why else should he bring new
workers whom we haven't seen so far?
I preserved what my father earned
with his brain and brawn.
You grew under its shade.
You won't understand its value.
The pepper in that shed
is more valuable than you.
When I step out in the evening,
the lost pepper should
be back in the shed.
You...!!!
That was worth Lakhs of Rupees!
Hey!
You...!!
Hey Shaji!
Shaji, what's the problem?
Shaji, what all troubles
are you bringing upon us?
Shaji!
Hey! What are you doing?
What should I do with the guy who's trying
to steal our stuff from our property?
Should I let him go?
Shaji....
Shaji...
Shaji, what happened?
Shaji...
- Hey Shaji!
Who is he?
Tell us who it is, Shaji.
Tell us what the
problem is, Shaji.
I'm asking you!
Who is he?
You've destroyed
our peace of mind.
Shaji, who is it?
He's the one who stole our pepper.
- So?
If you fight and kill each other,
will we get it back?
Mommy!
Son...
I told you to take Manu along.
Let me call the police.
I know what to do!
Shaji...
Set Blackie free.
He will handle it.
Hey!
Hey you!
You came to kill the dog, right?
He's in the kennel.
Kill him and get lost!
Shaji...
Don't do it.
What are you doing?
Shaji...!!
- Shaji...!!
Hey!
Son!
Shaji!
What are you doing?
Mommy!
- Shaji!
Shaji, he will die!
Shaji!
I'm telling you!
No!
I said no!
Leave him!
Let go of him!
Dear... Just tell him!
Shaji...
Leave him!
Shaji...
Dad...
- Hey!
No!
Hey!
If you hit them,
it won't affect me.
Move away!
I am here!
Come on!
Are you done?
Does it hurt?
Do you realize how it feels now?
'I know I'll never forget'
'But I can start up the hill'
'Days are grey
Clouds are back'
'Dreaming of my parted friend'
'Know the strides to me, far away'
'I’ll remember whole of you forever'
'Sun refused, wounds are deep'
'Your denial, in my heart'
Dear...
Go to him.
Go.
I'll think about it.
'I know I'll never forget my parted friend'
'I’ll be home,
Dreaming high, dreaming low'
'I know I'll never forget my parted friend'
'I’ll be home,
Dreaming high, dreaming low'
'I know I'll never forget my parted friend'
'I’ll be home,
Dreaming high, dreaming low'
'Kala'
