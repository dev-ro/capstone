They say,
Time is the greatest healer
As for me,
Time tormented me
l don't know
what time has turned me into
For, l was human once
Bala... Balajit Roy.
A table for three, please
Sorry, sir. You don't have
a reservation
Are you married?
- No
You're not married?
But l am married!
And this is our first anniversary
How can a guy who has...
Such a beautiful wife, not make a
booking on his first anniversary?
Correct, correct. He's correct
Joy... that's Joy Fernandes.
My best friend
And this is Nisha,
my sister-in-law
l tell you, she's made a huge mistake
by marrying my friend
lf not marry her, l'm surely
going to have an affair with her
And don't worry; my friend
is absolutely understanding!
See... Mr Bala... may l have
have affair with your woman?
Yes!
Sorry, sir, l'll have to
ask the manager
Manager? Why ask the manager?
When l got married, did l
ask the manager?
So why must l ask the manager
before booking a table?
l know my friend made a reservation
Did you make it?
- Excuse me.
lt's your wedding anniversary. Correct?
- Correct
She's presently your wife. Correct?
- Correct
So why would l make a reservation?
- Enough of all this
Let's go to another place,
or l'm leaving
Hey, one minute.
- Wait, we'll do something
Please call the manager
What seems to be the
problem, gentlemen?
They don't have a reservation, sir
What reservation does one need
to have an affair in Bangkok...?
But you need to reserve a table!
- But l want to have an affair and...
Let's... let's ask the manager.
Sir...
Please understand! Please understand!
- Please give them the table
Please... follow me.
- Thank you
The ass thought we were really drunk!
- You guys were the limit today!
Honey, ask him. l used to be
a terrific actor in school
Really?
- Yes, he wanted to become an actor...
but became a software engineer by sheer
accident. Shah Rukh Khan is lucky
lf this guy were in the movies,
Shah Rukh Khan would've been out!
You jerk, l'm here in Bangkok
and you're returning to Mumbai?
But my brother's getting married.
- lt's your brother's wedding, not yours
But...
- Hear me out
You can't help having the siblings
you have, but you choose your friends
So who's greater? The one you
can't help, or the one you choose?
Hear that? He ought to have been a
writer... instead, he's into software!
Javed Akhtar is lucky. Had this guy
been in films, Mr Javed Akhtar...
lf you guys are finished with your
flashback, may we order some food?
l'm very hungry.
- Sure, darling
lndeed. He had to become a chef...
- One moment, hang on
Today's my wedding anniversary.
Let me say something romantic to her
You say the romantic things,
l'll settle for romance
Don't you feel ashamed?
l do, but one look at my face,
and she goes running away
A sister-in-law is like
a mother, you know?
Don't let my father hear that.
lt'll give him strange ideas
l've never been able to figure out
the friendship you guys share
We haven't figured out either.
- Explain it to her
Open that, will you?
- Hey sorry
This is not fair, Bala.
You have such a lovely house...
an affectionate friend like me
and a beautiful and caring wife...
and what do l have?
- Come closer
You got shit luck
l wish my company would let me
develop software in lndia itself
Tell me something. ls this software
really going to be...
the end of the postal services?
Why else are they investing
so much of money in my project?
But their condition is that l operate
only from their office in Bangkok
Will you make a lot of money? As much
as the top industrialists?
Much more.
- How come?
Because the industrialists
don't have a friend like you
Pull my leg, go ahead! But no matter
how you blackmail me emotionally..
l'm going to have an affair
with your wife
Remember that girl in school?
l was about to hit on her
when you...
Hurry up, your cab has arrived.
You'll miss the flight!
One minute
Tell me something, Bala
Why are wives so jealous of the
friendship men share?
You'll get to know when you marry
l was about to...
when you made away with her
See? lsn't she beautiful?
lt'll take me four hours
on the flight now...
l'll see whether l can
find a nice airhostess
And you can have fun here.
- Have fun?
We haven't even a bed
and you talk of fun?
You have the floor. Granite-top
Don't we need mattresses? And there's
not even a towel here
From a sofa-set to spoons,
we still have to buy everything
lt'll take us a week to shop
and do up the house
Haven't you done any shopping yet?
- You were supposed do it
Me?
- Had you been here, you'd have done it
And l'd have fun with my wife.
- Oh yes
Yes, make me burn in envy.
Go ahead
Looks like even the aircraft
will crash at the way l burn
No aircraft is going to crash because
of a small-time sinner like you
Well, l must leave you now
You called me for your anniversary.
Also call me when you divorce
Sure.
- Shall we...?
Not her...?
Okay, maybe later
Go on... l'll fix you later
May l speak to Dr Chadha please?
- Speaking
Doctor, this is Nisha Roy here
l was calling regarding
my pregnancy test
Hi Nisha! You'll be happy to know
that you've tested positive
l'm sure your husband is
going to be delighted too
Congratulations.
- Of course, doctor
l must go and give him the
news now. Thank you, doctor!
Mister... mister... please!
For how long are you going to
keep me locked up here?
lt's already 3 months!
Please... at least tell me
what wrong l have done!
What have l done?
At least tell me what l've done!
Please, mister... please!
Damn you, you bloody swines!
Sister-fuckers!
lf you have the balls,
come on inside!
You want to fight,
come inside and fight!
l'll take you apart!
l'll tear you to shreds!
Mister... please
Okay, okay... l'm sorry.
Terribly sorry
l'm just a software engineer!
Never got into a fight with anyone
Please listen to me, mister... please
What do you want?
At least tell me
You want my software?
l'll give it to you!
But please don't lock me up here.
Please, mister... please!
Please open the door!
Please, mister...
Open the door!
l don't want any food!
Open the door!
Please open the door!
Open the door, please
Open the door
Had l known they'd hold me captive
in this room for 14 years...
would it have lessened my anguish?
Or increased it?
Fried wantons
Morning and evening, every day, every
single day... the same fried wantons
Red Circle
lt's believed in Buddhism that when
two people are destined to meet...
the place they meet at
is called the Red Circle
ls that what you're
trying to tell me?
l'm waiting
Whenever this tune is played, they
release valium gas into the chamber
lt's a gas used to control
dangerously violent criminals
When l've passed out...
somebody comes and gives me a haircut,
cleans up the cell...
changes my clothes
Bala...
Bala...
Now for the crimebeat
A woman was murdered in a bungalow
at Sandhurst Road last night
She used to live all alone...
ever since her husband, Balajit Roy,
went missing a year ago
He suddenly returned
home last night
There ensued a quarrel
between the couple...
following which Balajit Roy murdered
his wife and escaped
Police sources say that the blood stains
found on the victim's clothes...
matches Balajit Roy's blood-group
Balajit Roy's fingerprints have also
been found on a glass in the bungalow
The Bangkok police have launched
a massive manhunt for Balajit
l'm undergoing punishment.
My crime lives on
And l'm being kept alive
You're keeping me alive only because
you want to meet me, too
But you can't control
the way l think
You can't control my memories
l'll think of every person
l ever had anything to do with...
every human being
l must have ever harmed
Any harm
And my pain.
You can't control that either
Every line l carve on myself will
remind me of every moment l spent here
One line for each year
Who are you?
And when are we meeting?
Now, even l'm waiting to meet you
face to face
And this time, l won'tjust wait
l'll develop myself. For you.
Only for you
l have survived. l will escape
and destroy you
Princess Diana was given a final farewell
at the Westminister Abbey today
Hundreds of thousands of people assembled
to take one last look at her remains
The lndian army is doing its best to
throw out Pakistani infiltrators
Air strikes continued for
a fourth day today
lt's raining outside
Rainwater!
The sound of freedom!
l will get my freedom!
lt was 8:42 a.m. on Tuesday...
when the collision into the World Trade
Center was captured on camera
The second World Trade tower in
New York was also reduced to rubble
People fell over each other
in order to break...
every last remnant of Saddam's regime
Australia set a huge target
of 359 runs
Those that escaped, were lucky
But those that were swept away
by the waves...
were separated from their
loved ones forever
Everything has come to a standstill in
the last 3 years. Absolute standstill
Neither was there fog, nor gas,
nor was l made to faint
Nobody even gave me a haircut,
nor did anyone clean my room
But l'm ready
The day l come face to face with you,
l will destroy you
lt's getting difficult to recognise
Bangkok after long 14 years
So how will l recognise him?
Where will l look for him?
And what must he look like?
Who is he?
l haven't come here to save the women
of this city from these thugs
All l want to see is whether the
training l received from tv...
is any good
You liked the clothes?
Who are you? And why did
you do this to me?
Why did you hold me captive for 14
years and set me free like this?
You've been transferred, not set free.
From a small jail to a bigger one
This city is a jail for you, Bala.
Where would you go, if you left it?
Who are you? And why did you do this?
Fourteen years...?
lt either takes a madman to do
what l did to you...
or a lot of hatred
lf this is how much you hate me,
why did you keep me alive?
Why didn't you kill me?
Who are you?
Matt? Paresh Gilani?
lmran Hafiz? Sameer Hafiz?
Who are you?
l'm doing a research on you. Who l am
should not be as important to you...
as much as WHY? Not who, but why
Think, Bala. And think hard
Carefully read the
book of your life
The period at school is over.
And it's time for homework
By the way, your steak
is getting cold
486. Sandhurst Road.
- No English
Sandhurst Road.
Near the jetty... jetty?
Mister, you're an lndian.
So sit in an lndian's car
Don't get into that guy's trap.
He'll take you on a jolly ride...
and not even take you
to your destination
He'll burn a hole in your pocket too.
So c'mon, l'll take you there
Where do you want to go?
- 486, Sandhurst Road
By the jetty
By the way, you didn't ask the question
every passenger asks Jenny Singh
''How can a woman drive a cab?
That too, in Bangkok?''
l know Bangkok
like the back of my hand
That's because my father used to be
the driver of tourist buses
And l spent more time in the buses
than l spent at home
That's because my Mom died even
before l could say ''Mummy''
My Papa and l were the only ones
Papa resigned from his post at the
bus-service and bought this cab
But you know, tragedies and bananas
never come in singles
Dad died too.
Maybe to drive God's car
All that is left now is this taxi
and my antique house
Plot number 62.
Belonging to Jenny Singh, sir
The most beautiful one in Chao Thep
You appear to be silent types
Where do you want to go now, sir?
- How much do you earn in a day?
You're not a taxman, are you?
Without tips, 3000.
On good days, l make 5000
Here's 10,000. l want to go around
the whole of Bangkok today
For so much, l'd take you around
the whole of Thailand
Where'll l get fried wantons?
- China Town. Let's go
''This then, is my story...''
''about a quiet life''
''The silence asks me...''
''why l'm tolerating
the indignities'
''A legend, of days gone by...''
''from the lips of loneliness''
''Every wound seems to speak...''
''it seems to say something
to me''
''Agonising thorns of memories...''
''l pick from my past''
''ln the refuge of crumbling walls...''
''l'm still alive''
''lt's certainly not love,
my rosegarden sees...''
''lurking shadows of death''
''My eyes are excited with
everything that is familiar''
''There is no one who can tell me
how much l will have to wait for light''
''There is no one...
neither with me, nor at a distance''
''There is a friend,
my heartbeat...''
''which keeps telling me
what l seek''
''Life, l live...''
''swallowing on my own blood...''
''trying to sew life together
with thorns''
''There is no one with me anymore...''
''and yet, there is
the realisation...''
Stop, stop! How many restaurants
are you going to visit?
What on earth are you looking for?
- ''My desire to live''
''My heart, like a jungle
of memories''
''My heart, scarred by thorns''
C'mon. Let's go to another restaurant
''Piercing thorns of memories...''
''l pick from my past''
l'll wait for you in your cab
Hello, sir! Out! Out!
l don't want to get into problems.
Nor do l want your money!
Find another taxi
Else, Jenny will land in jail
and God will own the cab!
Shut up and drive
Where to?
- Some deserted place
Ask him who he works for and where
Ask him again
Hold it! He's willing to talk
Sit in the car
Cathay View
After that, you may leave
Open.
- Go away
There's always room in my hotel.
No, not the bodyguards
We'll have your guest picked up
from wherever you say...
and keep him here for as long
as you wish
No, no restrictions on the period sir.
We held a man here for 14 years
Additional services will
cost you extra
lf you want us to torture your guest
every day, it'll cost you extra
l'll let you know the dates.
They should be available
As you wish. Pay in installments
or a lump sum... it's okay
Why did you do it?
- Business. Nothing personal
Who asked you to do it?
Confidential
Who makes us do it and why...
we never know anything
We only do ourjob
Will you now squeal?
l don't know him
l've only spoken to him
over the phone
l never could meet him
''Death has been shamed...''
''for, in body...''
''there is still life''
''So much of wind, after all,
my breathing...''
''everything else has been
reduced to dust''
''l live...''
''but whatever for?''
''l'm alive...''
''but what for?''
''The assault was murderous...''
''and yet my fondness for wounds...''
''is still alive''
''My pulse is dipping,
the pain agonises me...''
''everything else is dust''
''l am alive...''
''but whatever for?''
Taxi! Taxi!
Chao Thep. Club no 62
Look after yourself, Bala
You...? You've come back?
Spare me, please!
l don't want your money, okay?
Find yourself another taxi!
Hey ass... you brought him here?
Look, mister... you're trouble, okay?
Trouble in my cab, trouble at China
Town and now trouble in my house!
Go away!
Look, l don't want to die so soon
l want to live
Have you really been
through all this?
You were quite ill last night.
You fainted... and l got worried
l called a doctor...
he put stitches on your back
and gave some medicines for you
Do you have a tape-recorder?
Why don't you have him killed?
- lt's necessary for me that he lives
As you wish, sir. A client's wish
is our command. So we'll keep him alive
But keeping him alive for so long
can even drive him insane
No. He mustn't go insane
Keep giving him medicines and see
that he remains in his senses
How long do we hold him here?
We hold him for 14 years.
- 14 years?
We haven't held anyone captive
for so long
May l ask you a question, if it
does not offend you sir?
What's his fault?
Balajit's fault is that he has
no control over his tongue
Neither will he live, nor die
He'll be fed twice a day.
ln a fully monitored room
l want him alive
Okay, sir
We share very old relations, Bala
The moment you and l have spent
14 years waiting for...
is now very close.
But it hasn't yet arrived
Anyway, let me give you another clue
to get closer to me
To Sea Runset
Where is To Sea Runset?
That's the old name of a club
But you can get there
only by boat
Bala...?
Balajit is a special guest of mine.
Do not bother about money
Such guests do not come calling
on me every other day
He must get VlP treatment.
Lace his drink...
so that he neither dies,
nor goes mad
l want Balajit Roy alive
Neither do l have the time to tell you
my story, nor even time to shed tears
l want this man.
You recognise this voice?
No
But who could hate you so much?
The question is how did he
get to know where you live?
Only he can tell
How's the reunion of friends
after 14 years, Joy Fernandes?
How did you get to know my whereabouts?
Whereabouts is no big thing, Joy.
Your blood group, your DNA...
and the number of snooker games
you've won in the last 14 years...
l know everything
- Listen, you...
l can trace this number.
- How? lt's a private number
l have my contacts
Before that, l need to
talk to the cabbie
Don't except mercy
because you're a woman
Tell me... who is he?
- l don't know anything
His name. Where does he live?
l don't know anyone!
- lf you don't...
how did he get to know where you live?
How could he send the cabbie here?
Why don't you ask him?
You have his number!
Bala, l've traced him. He lives
in the house opposite Jenny's
So here we are
Face to face
You and l have waited 14 years
for this moment
That's because before l kill you...
or perhaps before you kill me...
we must enjoy this moment to
the fullest. Am l right?
Who the hell are you?
What is know is that
you made me, Bala
And l made you
By the way, l also created a huge
business empire in these 14 years
But more than that, l'm proud
of the monster l have created. You
You make me proud, Bala.
To make money is easy
But to make a monster
is the work of a genius
Damn you...
Manners, boys. That's not
the way to treat guests
Especially when a guest has
just a short time to live
And you have no time at all
C'mon, Bala.
Can you really kill me?
Until you get to know why l held you
captive for 14 years?
Until you get to know why
l released you after that?
You have time till July 5th
to find the answers
Which means... only 4 days
Give me a chair
l'll first destroy every lovely thing
you like... and finally, you
When revenge is the meaning
of one's existence...
the meaning is lost,
when one has had his revenge
Man finds himself lonely.
That is why l kept you alive
And revenge for what?
What did l do to you?
You want to get to know everything
in the very first meeting?
Patience. All in good time
You'll get to hear the story
as well as its climax
l don't know how and why you and l
came into each other's life story
What l do know is that l will script
the ending of your story
And l have scripted
every thing in your life
You meet your friend and your
friend brings you here...
every little thing in your life
has been scripted by me
l'm the one who brought you
to Bangkok
The software company
you worked for...
happened to be one of
the many companies l owned
l have so much of money,
such a huge business...
and yet, l'm just like you.
Lonely
But l never felt the loneliness.
Because you were with me
All 24 hours of the day,
writhing in agony
lt's your pain that kept me alive.
Your pain was my cure
And now, your pain will be my cure
That's the spirit!
You are my pain and l am your pain
Let the worse pain win!
Pain it is that erases pain
He who suffers the worse pain
will win
By the way, you're quite careless
when it comes to women
You couldn't save your wife. And you've
even left Jenny all alone at home
You forgot to even shut the door.
Go and see if she's okay
Bad manners!
Haven't you been taught to knock
before you enter somebody's home?
Go down on your knees and
ask for forgiveness
Apologise!
Or the girl's going to die
Makes no difference to me.
- Really...?
Then why did you rush here
like a regular Romeo?
Good boy
You had my business closed down.
Now watch the fun
Keep these dentures.
You're going to need them
Good job. lt's going to be fun
Because it's my turn to
yank out your teeth
But l won't do it
You will yourself pluck out
your own teeth
Love it? Take it!
Stop
You're knocking out his teeth?
- Of course, sir. With pleasure!
You'll do nothing of the sort.
- Are you kidding, sir?
He'll have to pay a price
for my teeth
The price for your teeth
is lying in that bag
You know my weakness, sir.
Thank you
You're a fortunate man
He loves you so much
Let's end this episode right here
Else, l'm going to hack the hand
you touch the girl with
ln that case, you'll have to
cut off my tongue too
Do you believe me now?
Or do you still need proof?
Steel is up 14 points, pharma is up
23 points. What else is happening?
l need 2 million pharma
With competition, prices will fall
Get me lT, infocomm, airlines,
life insurance, hotels...
No, l'm not available for any
meeting. l'm busy with a guest
There are things in life
that mean more than profits
l'm neither greedy for money,
nor afraid of losses
Even if l lose a million
every day...
it'll take no less than 60 years
for me to go bankrupt
Sixty years. That means, l'll be
ninety-five. And broke
See you
Why outside the city?
Because you've been
sucked into this mess
He escaped because of you today
and l had to go down on my knees
You're making me a weak man
So l must keep you away from this
Sir, the two of them have left
They packed their bags
and left in a car
Keep an eye on them and
keep me informed
l hope you are not uncomfortable?
lf l'm causing you inconvenience,
l can take another room
l have no problems. You are the one
who looks hassled
For fourteen years you haven't been
with a woman
lf you find Gulfam, will you
really cut his hands off?
Yes
Because he hit me?
Scholar said he'd kill me too...
will he really?
Because you like me?
That's what he thinks
And you?
l have always lost the things
that l loved
l don't want to lose more
''l'm breathing...''
''blood still flows...''
''yet why don't l feel...''
''that l'm alive?''
''Am l alive?''
''Why is my heart on fire?''
''Why is my soul restless?''
''My heart beats to question...''
''if l am alive''
''Am l alive?''
''ln unspoken words,
in friendly loneliness...''
''l feel lonely in a crowd''
''Am l alive?''
''This desolate and dark...''
''restlessness...''
''looks for a familiar face... why?''
''My own lost existence questions...''
''am l alive?''
''Am l alive?''
You must use all your time
and energy to reach me
Because l'm your destination, Bala
l've got a present for you
l have done what you wanted to do
Just because l don't want you to
waste your time on such minor tasks
Every step you take must be
towards me, you don't have much time
Just four days.
Every moment is precious, Bala
The task isn't easier either
But ''labor omnia vincit''
Labour conquers all
Labour conquers all problems, Bala
God! My head is splitting
Feels like a bad hangover
Valium.
- What?
Effects of Valium gas
Which means...?
- He was here
Last night
He has also left something
l have done what you wanted to do
Just because l don't want you to
waste your time on such minor tasks
Every step you take must be
towards me, you don't have much time
Just four days.
Labor omnia vincit
Bala, this man is sick.
He's psychotic
We must get out of here
What about my fourteen years?
- And after you've taken your revenge?
l might become a human being again
But how does he know about all this?
My house, this hotel...
how does he know?
- l know. C'mon
What can l do for you?
''l have been bugged.
Find it''
lt was written ''Labor omnia vincit''
What does that mean?
Labour conquers all.
- What language is that?
Latin. And that's my school's motto
School!
l need a cyber cafe
To reach one's destination,
to achieve one's aim...
one has to sometimes wait for years...
track the rise and fall
of the bourses...
must be careful with stocks
you trade in...
who is collaborating with whom...
and who is faking collaboration
to raise his market value...
must watch everything
Unguarded territories
and competitive fronts...
must consider all that before
you attack
When you set a trap for the prey,
he mustn't get a hint
And when the prey is at your mercy,
attack
Kill
Labor omnia vincit
Labour conquers all
Labour conquers all problems
Yes, Bala?
Joy, did we have one Rohit Chopra
in school?
Yes, he was in our school.
Eight years junior
His sister was in our class.
Reema Chopra
Reema?
- Swine, you forgot Reema?
You ought to know Reema better
Remember your last day in school?
Guys, look! Reema Chopra!
The one in the centre
Take a good look at her, Bala.
lt's your last day in school
You are leaving tomorrow
Look
l'll miss her the most, really
You will miss her,
not us, eh?
Bala l tell you, he'll be the luckiest
who lays Reema first
You guys will just keep dreaming
And l will lay her, Joy
You will do it to her?
- l will
Bala, l'm the scoundrel,
the most shameless lad in school
l couldn't lay her,
you think you will do it?
Joy, what if l do it?
- Point
lf you lay her, Bala,
l'll lose 15 bucks
Bet?
- Done
Hurry up, no time
You...? Who are you?
- Hi. Reema Chopra?
Yeah.
- Hi. Bala
Balajeet Roy.
- Hi. What are you doing here?
Boys aren't allowed here!
- l know, but...
l wanted to meet you in private.
- Me? Why in private?
l wanted to give you a gift.
- Gift? Listen...
we have never met before, l didn't
even know your name. So why this gift?
Reema, accept this as a token
of our friendship
Friendship? l'm not so sure.
- C'mon Reema, it's just a simple gift
Take it.
- l'm getting late, l've got to go
Reema please... this is for you
with love, please take it
l don't need it.
- Please Reema. Please
Okay.
- Thanks. Won't you open it?
What? Aren't you acting strange?
- You won't imagine how happy l will be
Open it.
- l told you, l've got to go
Please open it, Reema. Please.
- God!
Damn the wrappings
What the hell is this?
- You like it? lt's for you
And now, wear that for me.
- How dare you?
Now just go from here!
- Fine, l'm going
l'll start shouting. Go!
- Going... relax. Going
And listen! Take this shit with you
Fine, l'm going.
- Go!
What happened?
- Wait
Done
Done, done!
l'm next!
Remember now?
Now you remember... Reema Chopra,
you, the auditorium and that panty?
After you were through,
the entire school had fun with her
That Reema Chopra
was a bloody whore!
Reema Chopra was not a whore
Hello?
Say she was not a whore
She was not a whore!
Who is that, Joy?
Say she was not a whore
My sister was not a whore
Joy, please talk to me
My sister was not a whore!
Yes, Bala
The story is about to end
Spring Towers, penthouse
l didn't intend to kill Joy Fernandez.
He invited his own death
l'm sorry, Bala
Keep him busy, while l clean myself
of his friend's blood
Bangkok always reminds me of Mumbai
The same traffic din,
the same heat...
conspiracies soaked in sweat...
some secrets...
and some bloody stories
You called me over to
tell the end of the story
You must've noticed that not one blow
from my men struck your head, Bala
Not because you are a better fighter
But because l forbid them
l didn't want you to lose memory
lt was all a lie, only to serve
my ego before my friends...
to win a bet. But it was a lie
For one small mistake in childhood,
you shoved me into hell for 14 years
14 years!
The story goes far beyond your memory
can travel, Balajeet Roy!
How's Reema, Rohit?
- Fine. Must be in her class
Will you do me a favour?
- What?
Go and ask your sister if she's
willing to get laid for 15 bucks
Wait, Rohit
Joy, won't you return
what Bala took from her?
So what do we get for 15 bucks?
- Reema Chopra!
Sister!
- What happened?
See how much we've earned
Wonder what you give for 15 bucks
that every boy wants
Kaka
Hang on
Go on
''My sister gets laid
for 15 bucks''
Open the door, Reema
Open the door, Reema! You'll die
- Sister!
Open the door
Before l could reach her,
my sister was completely burnt
lt took 14 years to make
a monster out of you
Butjust that one night
turned me into one
l kept extracting my revenge from you
But deep within, an eight-year old boy
still screams for his sister
l never knew...
just a careless word from my mouth
would lead to such a horrible end
Just a careless word?
lt took my sister's life...
and sent you to hell
for 14 years
Was it worth it, Bala?
Tell me!
Now l realise that
it was not worth it
But Rohit, whatever l did,
l did it unknowingly. Now l ask you
Such a grave punishment for my folly
in childhood... did l deserve it?
Wrong question, Balajeet Roy
You should ask me why
l set you free
You were held captive, and it was
the justice of an eight-year old child
Now you are released, and it is
the vengeance of a monster
Come
Bangkok has an interesting game
The girl in the centre...
is an innocent kid
And this crowd is bidding
for her virginity
he one who bids the highest
gets to take her...
to the bedroom
And he will snatch her innocence
l'm not interested in the game
No? You must take interest then.
- Why?
Another gift for you
Mr and Mrs Balajeet Roy's
happy family
Then a storm raged, and
swept away Balajeet Roy
The poor wife couldn't even tell
her husband that she was pregnant
Then l walked into her life posing
as your childhood friend
From the pregnancy to the delivery,
l took great care of your wife
l never let anyone meet her
Not even your family friend
Joy Fernandez
On your daughter's first birthday,
l got your wife killed
l heaped the blame on you
Afterwards, l raised your daughter
And now she's a fourteen-year old
young girl
ls she my daughter?
ls she my daughter?
ls she my daughter, Rohit?
ls she my daughter, dammit?
ls she my daughter?
My daughter?
Rohit please tell me,
is she my daughter?
My daughter... my child
My daughter
Yes, Balajeet Roy
Your daughter is of the same age as
my sister when she set herself ablaze
Your daughter too will go through
a test of fire now
The one who bids most,
will make a woman out of the kid
He was with me for 18 years,
like a shadow
l killed him too,
just to keep you alive
You won't watch your
daughter's circus alone...
the entire world will watch it!
On the internet
My daughter won't pay for my sins
On DVDs
On cellphones
Why did you stop? Hit me
Hit me
But it won't save your daughter
Hit me!
Don't punish my daughter
for my sins, Rohit
Save my daughter, please
Please! l beg of you
Please save my daughter
l shall be your slave forever
l'll do your bidding,
l'll be your dog
Please save my daughter
l'll cut my hands off!
My tongue committed a mistake
l'll cut my tongue off!
Please Rohit, save my daughter
My hands were too small
to save my sister
But you can save your daughter.
Not fair!
Please! Please
Rohit, please tell me her whereabouts
Please!
Even if l tell you, you won't reach.
Because you have only 30 minutes
l will try
Try?
l forgot it
l'll kill you, Rohit
lf you kill me, who will tell you
your daughter's whereabouts?
Tell me her whereabouts, Rohit
Your daughter is being plundered
in this very whorehouse
She is getting fucked!
l can save your life
for my daughter's sake, Rohit
l have achieved my purpose in life.
- No, Rohit
Just one word!
Give it to me in alms, please
l got one last shot left.
- Please Rohit
Last and final blow
Don't let go, Rohit. Please.
- l'll wait for you in hell
See you in hell.
- Rohit, please
Bala! What happened?
He...
- What?
My daughter
What...?
l know that place, Bala
Where's my daughter?
l don't know
Upstairs
Hello?
- Papa
Where are you?
- At home
Rohit spared my daughter.
And that was his last blow
Perhaps he too had a heart
Perhaps he saw his sister
in my daughter
That's probably why he
named her Reema
