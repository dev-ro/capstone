Okay. I'll call you later.
Bye...bye.
Hello.- Madam, a patient named Madhan is here.
What's the problem?
-I don't know.
He's silent & very abnormal.
Okay, send him in.
- Okay madam.
You can go.
- Okay madam.
Madhan, open your eyes.
Madhan, open your eyes...please.
Madhan, open your eyes.
Tell me, what's the problem?
Love.
Who is it?
A girl.
Her name...?
- Pooja.
What happened to Pooja?
Tell me Madhan, what happened to Pooja?
Tell me Madhan, what happened to Pooja?
Madhan...
- Pooja.
She left me...
...she eloped with someone.
I love her very much.
She ditched me.
Why?
Because I'm very poor.
Orphan.
I've no parents.
I don't know who is responsible for this face.
I don't know.
Then, why did I fell in love?
I didn't.
She did.
She was after me to love her.
I didn't fell in love.
I told her, I wasn't interested,
& I don't know anything about love.
And asked her to leave me alone.
She said she will d if I don't love her.
She said that.
But now...?
Where is she?
She is gone.
She has eloped with someone else.
She got a rich & wealthy man.
So she left me.
She is gone...
What happened to your sense?
You're an orphan.
Why did you fall in love?
You must get beaten up with slippers...
I must get beaten up with slippers...
I fell in love...by mistake.
By mistake...
She often used to say one thing...
It was...
...that she would be with me till death.
I didn't understand her words then.
Now I can understand.
She said that she would be with me till death.
Now I understand.
I died the day she ditched me.
I died.
This is just a corpse sitting infront of you.
Wearing this shirt,
and sitting infront of you like a disgusting thing.
I'm unable to forget her.
Madhan, cool down.
If Pooja has left you, let her go.
If not Pooja, choose some other girl.
It's wrong...
What you're talking is wrong.
How can I love some other girl?
That's wrong.
Be clear with one thing in mind.
Like we've only one mother,
there can be only one lover for a man.
Just one.
If he goes for too many girls...
It's ugly...it's disgusting.
I'm unable to forget her.
You think about love when you think about Rose.
I had planted her in my heart like a rose.
But while leaving me...
While leaving me, she pulled out the rose along with its roots.
While doing it the roots pierced into my skin & blood oozed out.
Madhan, calm down.
Calm down, Madhan.
...please.
Please...
- Don't cry.
I can't control myself.
Don't cry.
It's okay.
Why did you call me here so urgently?
To discuss an important matter.
What is it? Tell me.
Yesterday night, one man...
Caught your hand...?
Raped me.
Rape...?
In my dream.
Dream...!
But I really felt that he came to my room & raped me.
Who will enter your room?
You generally don't mingle with boys.
So someone has raped you in your dream.
Forget it.
Why discuss about something that had happened in dream?
I'm going to my class.
Do you remember the face of man who raped you?
Yes. Very well.
I think that such a man really exists in real life.
Better be careful. Bye.
Oh No!
She has scared me!
Does he really exist...?
Girls...Girls...Girls...
Daughters of many mothers-in-law.
I had made a flower bed for all the girls.
Ploys...ploys... ploys...
When I execute my ploys,
girls will find heaven in me.
"No one has mastered the romantic games of Cupid."
I didn't say that. The great M.K.T. said.
To execute the sin,
He shoots the arrows of love at the heart of girls.
He is ...
Manmadhan.
Ploys...ploys...ploys...
When I execute my ploys,

Your eyes are love trap.
Chics fall into your trap on their own.
Girls always flock around you.
Without you, a girl's life is colourless.

a wonderful singer,
and 100s of sizzling stars twinkle in my sky.
All the year,

I'll stick to you. Do not evade me.
Let's rub against each other,
bring our lips closer,
and become the season of love.
Let's cover our bodies with one another at night.
He's the only handsome guy...
He'll wage a war on you,
and will hoist the victory flag.
I'm a playboy.
Girls...Girls...Girls...
Daughters of many mothers-in-law,
I had made a flower bed for all the girls.
Ploys... ploys... ploys...
When I execute my ploys,

"No one has mastered the romantic games of Cupid."
I didn't say that The great M.K.T. said.

He is...
Manmadhan.
I'm Mohan speaking. - Yes sir.
I went through our company's auditing books.
Very good job.
But your fees is quite high.
What are you talking sir? I agree.
Unlike the other auditors,
I agree that I don't go through each & every transaction.
I agree that!
But whatever I tell you is very useful, right?
Correct.
That's why you've saved so much money.
Yes.
Then, what's the problem?
Okay. I'll sign your cheque.
- Okay.
Come to my office & collect it.
- Thank you sir.
I'll come. Bye.
Are you still thinking about that dream?
Actually, I've very scared.
Mythili, why are you scared?
I scared you just for fun.
Neither you'll see him nor such a guy will come in your life.
Hello Madhan.
- Hello sir.
What brought you here?
Your boss asked me to come to collect my cheque.
Okay.
- I'll get it.
Yes, tell me.
I was about to call you.
The rape scene in the film we saw yesterday was superb.
Very realistic...very thrilling.
We've smoked, boozed but never committed a rape like that.
If I get a girl alone, I'll rape her.
Hello...
Why are you pressing the buttons so hard?
The lift might get struck & we may be stranded here.
Just you & I, alone.
I've no problem.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Strange!
She is running away as if I was about to rape her.
I can't tell tins to humans.
So, I'm telling you.
Why did I get such a dream?
Malathi scares me that the dream will come true.
Just when I thought
it was only a dream...
Today I saw the guy
who raped me.
My heart stopped for a second.
I'm confused whether it is real or a dream.
I pray that it should be a dream.
Neither I should see him again,
nor should l ever get such a dream.
I must forget this bad dream & youire going to help me in this.
Please...
Oh no!
Did you hear what I was saying now?
What?
Did you hear what I was saying now?
I don't understand.
I can't hear properly.
That's why I've come to say tell Nandi.
Great!
Am I handsome...?
Wow!
Excuse me. May I know where can
I find the drums class is?
I don't know.
- Okay.
Hello...
Oh No!
Hello... Excuse me...
Excuse me.
Why are you running away from me?
I can't run. Stop.
I'm short of breath.
- Don't come closer.
Stop it.
What are you talking?
What did I do to you?
The other day, you saw me in the lift & ran away.
And even today, you're running away.
What's wrong with you?
The other day...
-When?
You entered my bedroom...
- Bedroom?
Don't shout.
Caught my hand...
I left your hand long back.
You hair style was different that day.
The day I saw you in the lift,
I understood that you've some problem.
Blit today, it is confirmed.
You're mad.
You're mad, right?
I've wasted my time talking to a lunatic.
Hi! Can I have some water please?
Thank you.
Who is this?
- Make a guess.
Guess...?
I think...Bolly.
- No.
Not Bolly...Sameer.
- No.
Vikram...?
- No.
Sunith...?
- No.
Naveen.
- Hey, it's me.
Oh my god!
Oh shit!
I'm really very sorry.
Okay, stay cool.
I'm extremely sorry.
You just look like my friend Anitha.
Hi! I'm Renuka Menon.
What about yourself?
Well. I'm Madhan. But I'm really very sorry.
I didn't really mean it, you know.
You just look like my friend Anitha.
Well, it's okay.
But...you know what?
You look like my boy friend too.
- Is it?
Come on.- It's okay.
It's okay.
I just sneaked out of my house.
Because my boy friend doesn't like me visiting clubs.
I like you. You're sweet.
- Thank you.
Would you ...for a drink?
No, I don't drink.
Oh no! A lunatic.
Hello...
God! Save me!
Hello green shirt.
I'm finished.
Why are you running away from me?
Do you understand now how it is when someone runs away from you?
That day, you ran away from me.
Do you know how I would've felt?
Now, I'm not afraid of you.
But you're still going back.
Will you have coffee with me?
Yes.
Your name...?
- Mythili.
Love me.
- Hello...?
It's a movie's name.
Your name...?
- Madhan kumar.
Call me Madhan if you like.
Did you swallow 2 eggs in your childhood?
No.
Your chubby cheeks inspire me to ask.
Hello...
I'll go away if you make fun of me like this.
Why are you so tensed?
Sit down...
You're getting tensed like a B.P. patient.
Who is tensed...?
This is tension. Got it?
Who is tensed?
Oh god...why are you behaving like a little girl?
We had come for a coffee, I'll go and get it.
Shall I ask him about that rape or not?
Already he thinks I'm mad.
If I ask him about it, then he'll think I'm really mad,
and tell everyone in college.
Let's not ask...
Have coffee... - Thank you.
Het's talk somethinq else.
Sorry...tell me about your family.
My parents are in America. I don't like to go there.
I like Madras.
Do you love any one?
Why is he asking that?
If I tell him that
I don't love any one,
he might immediately hold my hand and express his love.
Very dangerous guy...
I'll lie to him I've a boy friend.
That'll be better...
Just give one reaction for one question.
Why are you giving so many reactions?
Look here, I'm in love.
I've a boy friend.
Very good. Everybody should love.
I'm happy that you've a boy friend.
He's defying all my set ideas about him.
May be he's good.
Okay, time is up...shall I leave?
Hereafter we're friends aren't we?
Yes...
See, you're getting scared again?
You said you'll not get scared.
Sorry...
Who's Puncture Pandi here?
I'm Puncture Pandian...
What? - Will the cycle come?
Call the cycle... if it comes, take it.
Whether it will run well.
No other cycles are as good as mine.
Last month 2 cycles went on hire and they haven't come back.
Pandian, shall I take the cycle?
Yes...
Seat is shaking...
They adjust and sit in shaky assembly seats.
Can't you adjust the cycle seat?
Push it and go...or use it like a walking stick.
Brother, shall I take the cycle? - Okay.
Why there's no light?
There it's glowing... look and go.
There is no light in the cycle.

How much do you charge for an hour? - Rs.3
But in Kannapan's shop he charges only Rs.2.
Hire it from his shop.

Then come to me when I don't have cycle,
I'll charge Re.1.
Why are you taking....
I'll break your head, don't make me angry.

Okay, how is the place?
Veny dangerous, they are not returning the hired cycles.

Congratulations. - Yeah, thank you.
Who's this? - Forget about it, first tell me who is with you now?
Hello, who are you? Why are you talking rubbish?
In a week you're going to marry a Dubai groom.
You had been with him to beach resort,
I've taken your photos and video film with your boy friend.
If I release it, you'll be in trouble.
So, if you listen to me, it's good to you and me too.
How about you? You can understand Tamil, can't you?
My Dubai would be...

Okay, what do you expect now?
You know, you look ravishing in this balck outfit.
Who are you? You're somewhere here only.
Don't get tensed.
Please, why do you torture me like this?
What do you expect now?
I want a kiss.
Idiot! What's this nonsense?
I don't know who you are and you're asking a kiss, what's this?
I don't know how you would look.
Will you kiss me if you know how I look?
No, I didn't mean so.
Then how? - You want me to kiss you, okay I'll kiss you,
Tell me where you're... I'll meet you personally.
Shouldn't I atleast know your identity?
Okay I'll tell you.
You want to know my looks right?

Okay, where should I come now?
It's raining...where are you?
I'm in bike parking, on the left...Come.
I'll come...
I want to discuss an important matter.
Please tell me sir...
Recently, many girls are reported missing in Tamil Nadu,
Despite a thorough investigation, we've failed to know anything,
Were they been kidnapped or murdered,
is it one man or a gang?
We're clueless...
Because we didn't get any evidence or the body.
And the victims have no link between them.
Number of girls missing is on raise.
The details of the case, victims' photos are in this file.
Okay sir...
Before this problem snowballs into a big public issue,
and before Government exerts pressure on us,
It's your duty to solve the case.
So Mr.Devan, please act fast.
I'll do my best sir.
Oh god...why are you shouting?
I will be there in 10 minutes... I'm wearing the shirt now.
Oh god...I'll come...hang it down.
What a mad girl!
She's calling me home for dinner!
This mad girl's friendship is going the other way.
I've to put an end to it. What shall I do?
Hi... - Hi...Sorry I got late.
Some more rice.
No, its enough.
What happened?
That's...that's...- Don't I know?
You would have fell from bike driving drunken. - Very Intelligent!
Then what happened?
That's, I feel shy...
No problem, you can tell me.
That's...
My wife bit me while kissing.
Wife?
Yes... - What do you mean?
Are you married?
Yes.
Love marriage? - No.
Arranged marriage? - No.
Then? - Accident!
Accident?
A beautiful girl like you tried to commit suicide,
I stopped her.
She asked me if I can marry her,
And I did.
Have you seen Alaipayuthey film?
Like in the film we are living in our own homes.
We haven't yet consummated our marriage,
Whenever we meet, in an emotion,
she'll bite while kissing.
That's why...
Food is delicious.
I've eaten stomach full.
Where can I wash my hands?
Over there.
Hi...- Hi.
Why were you not coming to the class?
Yesterday it was my lip, today I've to find another.
What shall Ido?
I've to do something. What shall I do?
Who's that?
She's doing make-up at pack up age.
It's like Shopping mall... nobody is going to attend class.
Excuse me, may I have your lipstick please?
Why? - I' ve put a lip mark here.
I've a lip stamp, you want? - Okay.
Is this enough? - Enough!
Is this lip stamp?I can get it at my will.
Madhan, hi. - Hi.
Why are you scribbling in the air?
Lip stick on your cheek.
Is it? Has it gone?
This side... - I've put it myself, don't I know?
On the way my lover kissed me.
Lover? Stupid, Idiot.
Your poor wife... isn't she living for you?
How could you betray her?
Don't you feel it's a sin? Don't you've conscience?
You'll not come up in life.
Shouldn't spare guy like you.
Hello, mind your words.
Are you finished or have more?
My lover is my wife, my wife is my lover.
I'll call her lover when she makes me happy.
I'll call her wife if she troubles me.
That's according to her mood.
Sorry...very sorry... please.
I spoke without knowing... Forgive me please...
You've not reformed since your 'Kushi' days.
You've not changed your reactions too.
What's he blabbering?
O sorry...
What do you want?
I want to meet your wife.
Wife? - Yes.
Suddenly she wants to meet my wife.
What happened?
She is a crack...simply questioning.
That's...you can...but there's a small problem in it.
What's it?
If she sees me with a beautiful girl like you,
do you know what'll happen?
What'll happen?
What will happen!
She'll write a tale of love between us and sell it to AVM,
and make the film and run it for 200 days in Devi Theatre.
She's very suspicious.
You'll not believe...
Even if a lady reads news on T.V.,
she'll not allow me to see her.
Oh god...then no need.
Madan, no need to introduce...
I want to see her from a distance.
From a distance?
Please I want to see.
I think she'll not leave me.
Okay, I'll make it ready. - Ready?
No, I said I'll get her ready for you to see.
Nothing else... - Oh!
When? - Tomorrow.
What time? - I'll tell you.
Place? - I'll think and tell you.
Surely?- Definitely you can see her, can you go now?
This is library.
What a crack she is!
Where can I find girls?
Come, where is your wife?
You told me she'll be on time.
Where's she?
Wait.
Why are you looking at other girls here?
Don't you know who's your wife?
Wouldn't I show you if I know.
This girl looks okay.
Come here.
Why are you hiding?
Come this side... that's my wife. - Where?
How's she?
Very nice.
Did you see the life I've given to a girl who tried to commit suicide?
Even she'll not take a Rs.100...
Excuse me. Can I have change for Rs.100?
I've no change...
You've no change for 100, do you need a girl friend?
I'll get it from automan.
She's always like this...very cheap.
Always asking for change... her father is a silly man.
That's why she talks so.
You bloody...you rascal...fraud.
You've cheated me.
Suicide...lover is your wife
and wife is your lover,
You've uttered many lies.
That's why I wanted to see your wife.
Got
caught nicely? Wait!
Hello, you remember me?
I prayed to you earlier not to meet Madhan or see him,
I'm that Mythili.
I think you would've forgotten it.
That was for good only.
Listen carefully what I say now.
But don't leave it through that ear.
Madan is a very good man.
I've to love him, marry him.
I've to beget many children.
I'll see to all that...
He must live with me all my life,
you take care of that.
Who are you? Oh you're deaf.
That was earlier...wouldn't my prayers bear fruits?
Definitely you'll get Madhan.
You don't worry. All the best...enjoy.

I got wet even after the rain stopped.
Oh girl...
I developed love on you.
I nourished love for you in my heart.
I nurtured a plant in my heart.
When you bloomed as a flower in that plant,
I developed love on you.
Where did I find you?
I found you inside me.
I etched your image in my eyes.
I sowed you in my heart.
After that, he met her once.
He told her that he first saw her in the bus,
and later in the college & expressed his love for her.
But she never gave a ear to him.
She simply walked away.
Only when he turned back he knew that she never listened to him.
His heart broke into pieces.
He cried because she didn't love him.
But she expressed her love writing "I love you" on the wall.
Don't kill me with your looks.
The sun has fallen into my hands. I tried to control my desires.
You made them flow like the waves of the sea.
Don't kill me with your looks.
I tried to control my desires.
You made them flow like the waves of the sea.
He used to walk alone in her memories,
But after she expressed her love, he walked along with her
They were a happy lovers.
Sir, auditor is out of station. He wanted me to give you the key.
Okay. I spoke to him. You can go.
Hey Skin head!
I want to tell you something, come.
- Oh! Is it you?
Come fast.
You love Vaishu very sincerely.
But looks like Seenu will take her away from you.
Often I've seen Vaishu & Seenu moving very close.
How dare you...
You dog!
- Why are you hitting me?
Don't beat me.
I'm telling you the truth.
Don't talk bad about Vaishu.
Why are you beating me?
Hello.
- Hello Vaishu, I'm Madan.
Hi Madan.
Where did you go after college?
I was waiting for your call only.
Today, Ravi bad mouthed you & Seenu. I hit him.
Rascal! He suspects you both have an affair.
You suspect me and Seenu, don't you?
But you're lying that Ravi said this.
I know.
- No Vaishu.
You suspect our relationship.
You don't trust me.
- No Vaishu.
That's why you're acting with me.
How could you suspect us?
Vaishu, just a minute. He said this & I didn't.
I swear, I don't suspect you.
Do you know how much I love you?
You're important to me.
But you suspect me of having an affair with Seenu.- No...
Shit!
Why should I suspect you, Vaishu?
Don't talk to me hereafter.
Vaishu, please...
I didn't say that and I don't suspect you.
I won't talk to you again.
Please...Vaishu...
I won't talk to you... Okay.
Hello...
What happened?
- I had a quarrel with Vaishu.
Shit! Crying like a kid for such a simple thing? Look at me.
No. I will meet Vaishu in her house. Okay...
You said you had a quarrel with her. - No...
She might be angry with you.
- No, I will meet her. Please...
Listen to me.
Talk to her in the morning...
She is already angry with me,
Let me find out what she's doing and then I'll ring the bell.
Vaishu, do you know how beautiful you are!
But how did you fall in love with that guy?
I really don't like that.
His face, his personality
& shaven head...shit!
One must be qualified to love you.
He's a low class fellow.
Do you know one thing?
Even my maid servant won't love him.
How did you fall in love with him?
Love him...?
I'm not mad to love him.
I used the word 'Love' to trap him into marriage.
And he believed me.
So, you don't really love him?
It is him who truly loves me. I want that.
What do you mean?
If I marry him, he would never suspect me.
He won't beat me or scold me.
He'll be very affectionate.
He might even sacrifice his life for me.
He'll listen to whatever I say.
He'll be after me like a dog.
I decided to marry such a guy.
Since I wasn't interested to directly express my love,
I wrote it on the wall.
If I make him my husband,
I can flirt & enjoy just like now.
Do you understand now!
If he suspects us...?
He is already suspecting us. -What do you mean?
Do you what happened?
I phoned you after that
& asked you to come here.
My grandpa is out of station, was an advantage.
By now, he would be crying in his hostel.
Seenu, get me my clothes.
Take it.
Who will it be?
Why is he here?
Why did you come here at this hour?
Have you come here to seek my forgiveness?
Not necessary.
Please go away.
Didn't I tell you
I won't talk to you again?
You still suspect us.
It will never go.
I won't discuss about that with you.
Even now, Seenu is here.
You might suspect why he is here at this hour.
We were studying together. Combined studies. Is this enough?
Madhan, trust her. We were doing combined studies.
She is telling the truth.
We were doing combined studies.
If you don't like it, tell me. I will never talk to her.
Someone is misleading you. I can't bear that.
You & Vaishu are true lovers.
You both must live happily.
If my presence creates any problem between you both,
I cannot bear that.
I'll go away from her life.
Vaishu, let's break our friendship.
- Seenu, shut up.
Don't break our friendship because of him.
Why should we stop our combined studies?
Let him go if he wants to.
Do you know what's running in your mind?
You don't believe us.
You think we were doing something wrong.
To be frank,
you think I was sleeping with Seenu.
Yes, you were sleeping with him.
I did it unknowingly.
Vaishu, hit me...
You & Seenu...
Are you dead?
I killed her...
Why am I crying now?
You commited a sin.
I killed you.
Then, why should I cry?
Why am I crying?
- I don't know.
I won't cry hereafter. I've changed.
I want to you ask you something.
How was she? Very nice...!
I won't kill you.
People even drink phenol if they get it free.
If you get a girl, who will leave her?
She was very nice...!
She is my girl friend. She must be very nice.
Now, I must kill you.
If you go out
& reveal about it...
I've seen too many films till now.
Madhan, I won't say anything about it to anyone.
I won't say anything about this murder to anyone.
Let's hide it.
Believe me. I swear I won't tell this to anyone.
Madhan, do you one thing.
It was Vaishu who was interested in me,
she forced me to come.
So I came here.
Don't I know she's your lover?
How will betray you?
I came because she called me.
You came because she called you?
So, you wouldn't have come if she hadn't called you?
You came because she called you?
So, you wouldn't have come if she hadn't called you?
You came because she called you?
But if she asks you to come, you'll come, right?
If yes, shake your head like this.
If No, shake your bead like this.
But...shake your head.
So, if she asks you to come, you'll come.
Why are you talking in a female's voice?
Vaishu, tell me.
Why are you looking down? She has died & is up there.
Why are you looking down instead of looking of up?
Look up.
Tell me Vaishu...
What...? Is it boring?
Do you want to do combined Studies?
Do you want Seenu?
Seenu, Vaishu wants you. Go.
Seenu, you said you'll go if she calls you.
You shook your head like this.
Go Seenu. - No.
Seenu, don't break your friendship for me.
Continue your friendship up there?
Do combined studies, Seenu.
Go Seenu.
I won't...Madhan.
Go.
No...- Go.
No...- Won't you go?
Okay, I'll send you there.
Vaishu, just 2 mins. I'll send him there.
If you stand here, I'll kill you in one blow.
If you try to run, I'll chase & kill you.
How do you want to die? Easy or the hard way?
Vaishu waiting.
If you want to die the hard way...
Go man...
Madhan, leave me.
I told you to go.
Won't you go?
Die...
Go...
Hey, what are you doing here?
What do you mean?
Was I narrating a stop or what?
I told you that I killed them.
You're talking too much.
Hey, why are you shouting? Stop shouting. Sit down.
Raising your voice...
I must be tensed & not you.
You could have solved the problem talking to her.
Yes, I did the same.
She talked too much, and I solved the problem by killing her.
Killed her...!
It is Love which is responsible for everything.
Love...love...love...
You've killed 2 people because of love.
Bloody love!
What do you know about love?
Did you ever fall in love?
Do you know the pain of love?
When parents die, we only shed tears.
When love or lover dies, he also dies.
Has anyone committed suicide on his father's death?
Has anyone committed suicide on his mother's death?
Has anyone committed suicide on his brother's death?
No. Here, blood relations have no value.
But love is beyond color, caste, creed.
People sacrifice their lives for love.
That's love.
It's a pain.
Those who love can only feel the pain. You won't know that.
No one has the right to talk about love.
She fell in love with you, but slept with someone else.
Will you kill her for that?
Okay. You fall in love with a girl. Marry her.
If I take her away, how would you feel?
Don't talk nonsense.
It's disgusting.
She is your sister-in-law.
You...- Hey...
It sounds nonsense
& disgusting, right?
I killed them because I couldn't bear that nonsense & her disgusting act.
There are so many girls doing the same thing.
I will find them all.
And I will kill them.
So, you mean all girls are bad?
When did I say that?
Who are you to alter my story?
The story is mine. Don't build up on your own. Just listen to it.
We are here because of our mother.
I didn't say anything bad about her.
Mother Theresa became mother to orphans.
I never said anything bad about her.
Our state is being ruled by a mother.
I never said anything bad about her.
There are good girls & bad girls too.
I don't mean all girls are bad. Some are good & some are bad.
I'll kill those girls who betray boys in the name of love.
Will you kill them?
Do you think you can escape from the police?
Police won't spare you.
Neither police nor you can do anything to me.
From tomorrow, I'm going to change my style & everything.
Brother...
"Behind every successful man there is a woman".
This was said by someone.
"Behind every successful criminal also, there might be a girl"
It's my statement.
From tomorrow, I'm Manmadhan and not skin head Madhan.
You've gone mad. You...
I snatched the wire while coming in.
Don't shout. I've also locked the door. You can't come out.
If you reveal this to the police, I'll kill you too.
Okay. Bye. See you.
I'm Manmadhan & not skin head. Okay.
After that, police interrogated me
I told them that I knew nothing about him.
I lied that I never saw him.
Even the police were unsuccessful to find him.
I never saw him again.
The case remained unsolved.
One day, my auditor died.
After his death, all clients started to come to me.
I started to earn.
Later, I joined a music college.
I met Mythili there.
Just because myself & my brother look alike,
She mistook my brother as me & complained to the police.
She is not to be blamed.
This is the truth.
This is what happened.
Hello.- Hello.
I'm Shanmugam, Inspector of B2 police station in Coimbatore.
This is Constable Surendar speaking.
The statement given by Madhan,
and the details collected in my investigation match well - Okay sir.
I'm the sending the case file through courier immediately.
You receive it.
- Okay sir.
Inform A.C. Deva that
I had called. Okay.
Okay sir. Thank you sir.
- Welcome.
I'm Madhan's uncle.
He's innocent.
Release him somehow.
Look, the enquiry is going on. He's telling the truth.
Wait for sometime.
He's innocent, sir.
Look, don't cry. Forget it.
You came to know the truth only when I told you.
Things destined to happen will happen.
It is my mistake.
I informed the police in haste.
If I knew the truth...
You're Madhan's uncle, right?
- Yes.
Your complaint and our arrest both are wrong,
The interrogation is over. Madhan has told the truth.
Madhan's release is confirmed.
And Manmadhan who is out there, what is his crime?
He killed the girls those who commit crimes.
We won't catch him.
So, you were only bluffing.
That's the real picture. They cannot catch him.
You don't worry about anything.
Madhan's release is confirmed. Don't worry. You can go.
You also don't worry.
Madhan will be released.
We won't catch him.
I know, you won't catch him...
Don't cry.
The case where young girls of Chennai were kidnapped & killed,
has taken a sudden turn.
The accused Manmadhan who is in jail is found to be innocent
in the police interrogation.
Manmadhan's younger brother who is look alike of his elder brother,
is found to be the real murderer.
In this situation,
the court is going to pass the judgement tomorrow.
Will innocent Manmadhan be set free or...
will he be in jail till the police finds his brother?
Will Madhan be set free tomorrow?
- Definitely.
By looking at you,
I think you love him.- Yes.
Have you expressed your love to him?- No.
Oh no!
A great mistake.
You must express it as soon as possible.
Madhan will definetely be released tomorrow.
You don't need a beach or park to express your love.
Express your love inside the court. Then watch...
My dear Mythili, love me.
He'll sing & dance around you.
People are waiting to watch that.
Operator, start the song.
My dear Mythili, love me.
My dear Manmadhan, you're my lover boy.
From the days of black & white movie,
when we see heroines like you, our eyes will start shooting arrows.
By winking your eyes, you're trying to catch the rainbow.
With your cute smile, you sparked a fire in my heart.
You were a demon to me when you stripped my clothes off.
After my clothes were stripped off, you were a cupid to me.
I mistook you & abused you.
Now that I know you I'll hug you.
My dear Mythili, love me.
Madhan who was accused of kidnapping & murdering several girls,
is found to be innocent.
It has been proved that his brother Manmadhan is the real murderer.
So, the court orders the release of Madhan & declares him innocent.
Also, the court orders the police to arrest Manmadhan.
Uncle...
- Madhan...
How are you uncle? - Madhan, how are you?
Madhan, look there. Someone waiting for you.
Go. She's waiting for a long time. Go I say.
I mistook you as Manmadhan & informed the police.
If I had known the truth earlier, I wouldn't have done like this.
Do you know how much I love you?
I love you very much.
Look, I know that you love me.
I tried to avoid you because I didn't want you to love me.
But still you started to love me.
I was your friend because
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.
But now I tell you,
I cannot love you.- Why?
I don't know.
But we won't gel well together .
Look, you first thought
I was a mad.
Do you know a truth?
You think I first saw you in the college.
But I first saw you in my dream.
You raped me in the dream.
I lost my virginity to you in the dream.
But after meeting you in the college
& found you were a good man,
I lost my heart to you.
If you don't love me,I might even sacrifice my life.
Please don't say that you don't love me.
Don't talk nonsense.
I've many reasons for not loving you.
Please try to understand. I can't love you.
When you are so stubborn, I don't want to compel you.
I believe that one day you will definitely accept my love.
Good bye.
I like you.
I love you. But I can't express it.
I cannot express it. Because...
I mistook you as Manmadhan & informed the police.
If I had known the truth earlier, I wouldn't have done like this.
Do you know how much I love you?
I love you very much.
It is me who kidnaps girls & kills them.
My brother is in no way related to this.
The truth is that he killed only his love Vaishu & Seenu.
After killing them, he came to my house.
and said that he would kill all girls, and he is Manmadhan
Whatever I said to the police was a lie.
After killing them, he came to my house.
But something else happened.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Don't cry. What you've done is not wrong.
I'll take care of everything. - Brother, I didn't do it wantedly.
After seeing that ugly thing, I killed them in a fit of rage.
But I'm very scared now.
You don't worry.
I'll take care.
Sleep. Everything will be fine. Sleep I say.
Sleep.
Hey...open the door.
Hey...
what are you doing man?
Brother, forgive me. I'll die.
I don't like to live.
Hey...no... listen to me.
Hey...listen to me. Don't do it. Get down. Please...
Get down. Listen to me.
You shouldn't die.
Listen to your brother. Please...
Man can go in search of money or job. But not death.
Death must come in search of us.
I beg you. Get down.
I'm already dead. This is only a corpse.
Corpse shouldn't live on earth.
I'll die.
I've no one other than you.
Please listen to me.
It'll pain when you hang yourself.
You won't be able to bear that pain. Listen to me.
Brother, this pain is nothing.
I've undergone that pain. This is nothing.
I can understand...
I would've died that moment I killed her.
But I couldn't because I've no parents.
You are everything for me.
You brought me up & did everything for me.
I doubt whether I'll get a brother like you in my next birth.
That's why I came to see you once.
Don't die.
I've seen you and that's enough. I'll go...
I don't want to live. I'll go...
Listen to me.
I'm with you.
Hey, don't do it... Please... - Bye... - Please...
He is gone...
He is gone...
My brother...
You're not dead.
You're still alive.
One girl betrayed you
& you killed her.
There are so many girls who do the same.
I'll kill those girls who betray boys.
I'll kill them...
Hereafter, I'm you & you're me.
From today, you're Manmadhan & not skin head Madhan.
I'll keep your death a secret. I'll... How...?
I burnt my love for you just like burning my brother.
If my brother had got a good girl like you,
his life would've been a happy one.
And our life would've also been a happy one.
But everything happens according to our fate.
I'll live like this only. This is important to me.
I don't know whether what I'm doing is right or wrong.
Only god knows.
God is with me.
Though Manmadhan escaped... from the clutches of law.
someday, he must answer the law.
