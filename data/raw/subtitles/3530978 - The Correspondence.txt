Do you think
there's anything that we don't know
about each other?
What a question
at six o'clock in the morning.
Secrets
mysteries we still hold
for each other?
We are one big mystery.
That is the only reason
we are together.
No, come on. Answer me.
It's been ages since you gave me
one of your vests.
Will you be serious?
Is there something I don't know
about you that I should do?
The other ones have lost your scent.
Then I'll wear one the next time.
- At the conference?
- No, kamikaze.
Sooner than that.
Just whistle for me.
I'll join you wherever you want.
I'm sorry we can't be together
as much as we'd like.
We've talked about this.
It's enough that you're there.
Nothing else matters.
I'll wait for you.
Always.
You are going to miss your flight.
You never answered my question.
You can talk, you're a galaxy
full of unknown stars.
That's why I'll never tire
of observing you,
to discover every last one of them.
Well, good luck!
Thanks.
- See you soon my love.
- Yes please.
Soon, baby...
The correspondence
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
One less for you
to have to discover?
Amazing! How on earth did you know
we'd talk about stars?
Dexterity, my dear kamikaze,
an old man's dexterity!
Cut!
- Everything Ok, Amy?
- Yeah, it just hurts a little bit.
You tensed up as you fell. You were
leaning too far to the right.
When you land, be more flexible,
balanced, like this, yeah?
- You guys Ok?
- Yeah!
Hello? Am I speaking to
this world or the next?
It's hard to say.
- I hope the first hypothesis.
- So how did it go?
- Still in one piece?
- You might be disappointed
but it would indeed appear so, yeah.
Ok everybody. Let's take it
from the fall to the explosion!
Oh, looks like you spoke too soon.
You're gonna be blown
apart all over again.
You're not being very nice today.
Get it into your head
that in one or many pieces,
you're going to have to put up with me
for a long, long time to come.
- Will eternity suffice?
- Umm, I'm not sure about that.
But we can negotiate that point.
- Ready to roll!
- Off you go, my love!
- But don't die too much.
- Yeah, I'll do my best. Big kiss.
- What did they ask you?
- About the formation of the galaxies.
- How did you go?
- Ok. He's a nice guy, yeah.
Amy Ryan! Please...
Good morning.
Have you finished polluting
the heavenly vaults
with syncopated chopped up words?
- I'm sorry professor. I'm mortified.
- All right. That's enough.
Reveal to us the nature
of the god particle.
The god particle is none
other than the Higgs boson,
theorized in 1964.
But I refuse to believe that was
a lucky strike, this time.
A case of joint collective
synchronicity, I guess.
- What's up on your face?
- What?
Have you been making
a remake of "braveheart"?
- No, I've just started painting the room.
- Well...
Synchronicity or not, I'm really
glad it went so well for you.
- Hello?
- When's the next exam?
- What?
- I said when's your next exam?
March 27th, spectral
evolution of galaxies.
Wow, what a tough one!
You're gonna have to do less cartwheels
and more study, my girl.
- Too paternalistic.
- Ok, I might forgive you.
If you tell me the title of your talk
in the conference.
String theory:
Literary illusion
or the theory of everything?
Cosmic Harmony,
parallel universes.
Exactly.
And the space-time dimensions
on the basis of which
we should all have ten doubles dispersed
in the infinity of multiverses.
- So there are eleven of us?
- Eleven eds and eleven Amys.
So even if all your clones were married,
adding up all their free time,
we could be together forever.
- Yes we could.
But, darling, I'm afraid I am not going
to be able to be there.
- I have to do a lecture in California.
- Oh, no!
When will I see you?
It's already been two months.
Soon. Soon, I promise.
- Soon.
- At Borgoventoso?
Yeah. We haven't been there for ages.
But I've got something
really awful to tell you.
Hold on.
Hallo?
I'll be done there in five minutes.
Excuse me, daddy.
- What's the matter?
- I'm going to do my homework at Emily's.
- See you later.
- All right.
- Nicholas!
- Yes, daddy?
Take it easy on the nice boy act.
You were saying something awful?
Yes. I've lost the keys.
One of your ten doubles will probably
find them for you.
- Ok, one second.
- You go, I'll hold on.
- Hi.
- Ryan? Amy Ryan?
Yes, that's me.
- Sign.
- Thanks.
An anonymous package.
- Who could it be from?
- Certainly not from me,
even though since I've known you
I have used
that magnificent identity
from time to time.
You really are a wizard!
How did you do that?
Because you've already told me
that you'd lost your keys.
Afraid it's a case of cryptomnesia,
very rare in somebody your age.
How did you get him to come here
while we were speaking about it?
Collective synchronicity,
gravitational pull
or just a low fashion case of luck!
- I think you have to go.
- Yes, but stay there a minute.
Let me look at you.
You're so beautiful.
- Not like the show?
- Do you?
- Really sociable, your friend.
- Not half!
Cut! Move it!
- Are you Ok? Everything ok?
- Yeah, ok.
Perfect Amy! You were great!
We're doing a disembowelling scene
in about a month. Interested?
- Yeah, sure thing!
- Fantastic.
When she's risking her neck,
she's happy!
Well, let's just say I like opening
my eyes again, afterwards.
You've improved enormously.
That's enough for today.
Thank you.
See you next time.
- You take your iPhone to bed with you?
- Why not?
Anything not to have
to sleep with you.
- Hey, what's up with you?
- Keep your nose out of my private life.
Cool it, cool it.
I'm unavailable right now,
please leave a message.
Hello.
How are you?
What? What is it?
Butch! Butch!
- Hello, Amy...
- Hi!
- For you!
- Oh, thanks Tommy.
Thanks. See you soon.
- Bye.
- Bye.
My only girl
today is our sixth anniversary.
How could you think I'd forget?
Yes, all right. I know I've seemed
to have my head in the clouds
much of the time
but in fact as I get closer
to hyperuranium
I feel closer to you.
Well, what was I lecturing
on when I first saw you?
The concept of infinity
in the history of astronomy.
The only truly worthwhile
symposium of my career.
I remember the exact moment
when I first caught sight
of your entranced expression.
And I knew then,
how a lost soul must feel
when it recognizes the one into whose
body it wishes to be reincarnated.
And then we were together
even when distance
kept us far apart.
And this is how it will always be,
how it's been
all these wonderful years
these six most beautiful
years of my life.
For me, too.
So thank you, my darling,
my love, my soul.
Thank you for what you've given me.
Take care, see you soon!
Bye!
I'm unavailable right now,
please leave a message.
Dear professor Phoerum,
I don't know if you'll remember me
but I'm Amy Ryan,
the kamikaze student.
I wished to inform you that I've just
received your excellent lecture.
I'm most grateful to you
for remembering.
I hope to see you soon in order to put
to you some further questions
on infinity and the new frontiers
of metempsychosis.
Until then, accept my good wishes
for your work.
Good morning. Welcome.
Delighted to see such a lot of...
And thank you to everyone who
has contributed to the organization
of our annual conference
on astrophysics and cosmology
centre for quantum
computer technology...
...allow me to say a few words
about professor ed Phoerum
who for many years enhanced
the life of our university
with his unforgettable seminars
and who just a few days ago
regrettably, passed away.
It was only last week
that he called me from Edinburgh,
to tell me that he wouldn't be able
to make this conference.
I wonder if you would all rise
and observe a minute of silence
for our colleague,
for a wonderful man.
A colleague and a dear friend.
- Ed Phoerum.
- Excuse me.
I'm unavailable right now,
please leave a message.
I'm sorry, professor,
it's Amy Ryan again.
I need to speak to you urgently.
Anyway, I'll try again later.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
I'm unavailable right now,
please leave a message.
- Hello?
- Amy, at long last!
I've been trying to reach you for days.
I dreamt about you last night.
- Yes, I'll call you back.
- Wait, Amy! Don't hang up!
His exceptional gifts
as a popularizer...
According to Phoerum
and many other astrophysicists...
Lectures and seminars
all over the world...
Professor ed Phoerum
died on 15th of January,
but only today did his family...
15th of January?
My only girl, today
is our sixth anniversary.
How could you think I'd forget?
Yes, all right. I know I've seemed
to have my head in the clouds...
My sweet Amy, suddenly I felt
the need to write to you.
We chat everyday but...
I miss the excitement of holding
in my arms the same piece of paper
you'd lain yours on.
Of knowing you'll hold my letter
and stop whatever it was you
were doing to read it.
Hello. The first flight
to Edinburgh, please.
So here I am wondering
what you're doing right now...
Where are you?
How should I picture you?
What are you looking at?
I feel like missing the whole
world around you,
almost as much
as I miss you yourself.
Take care, my lovely girl.
See you soon. Your ed.
Edinburgh, January 20th, 2015.
I'm unavailable right now,
please leave a message.
Is it you who's looking
for professor Phoerum?
Yes.
- I haven't heard from him for some time.
- Doesn't he teach here?
Oh, not anymore.
I know he wasn't well. But why
are you looking for him?
I'm sorry, I can't find him.
Have you checked to the
graveyards in the city?
Yes, I have.
- But there's no record.
- And you're sure he's deceased?
Oh, hang on. I'm sorry.
Here he is. Edward Phoerum.
In fact, there's no grave but he
was cremated on the 20th of January.
Thank you.
My love, if you're the girl I know,
I guess you'll be going
to my home town
exploring my old homes.
If that's right,
if I'm not mistaken
please go to the offices
of Glen Durrell
...342 Newington street.
I'm thinking of you
and hugging you.
I will never abandon you. Your ed.
Please, sign here.
So professor Phoerum isn't...
Isn't...
Unfortunately.
Shortly before he died,
he left me something
in fiduciary deposit for you.
If there's anything I can do,
don't hesitate to call.
Hello Amy,
this belonged to my dad.
He wore it for every university exam
and never failed one.
I wore it after him.
I'm sure it'll work for you.
I will love you anyway,
everywhere, forever.
Your ed.
Miss! Miss!
You forgot this.
- Miss Amy Ryan?
- Yes.
You're the last one.
Hello Amy.
You know, I'm beginning to get it.
I mean, the reason why when
you cross to the other side
the first thing you lose
is the right to speak.
Because...
Because you don't have a clue
where the fuck to begin...
Yeah, I know what you're thinking.
I know perfectly well.
Why didn't I tell you.
Why didn't I tell you?
Well, because it
seemed pointless,
inappropriate, I mean,
out of tune.
Something that should
have no part of us,
something that had nothing
to do with us
and which, at the end of the day,
hasn't happened.
Besides that, I didn't want
to see you suffer.
You'll think it's easy for me now,
not seeing your pain.
And you're right, it is easy,
but you know I have always
been a lucky devil.
On the other hand, I am sorry not
to be able to get your messages.
But who knows,
maybe our doubles
will come up with something.
Who knows? Let's see.
In my own small way,
I've been putting a lot of thoughts
into this lately.
So you'll see,
your old wizard won't abandon you
without a struggle.
But I don't want to become
one of those ghosts
who end up in a kind of limbo,
just being a pain in the arse
to those they leave behind.
When you get fed up with
my existential stubbornness
you'll send an email to my address
with your own name
repeated eleven times.
Just that.
Then I'll leave you in peace.
- What's going on?
- Ls there a problem?
- Everything all right?
- Uhm...
Ok, we're done.
Are you Ok, Amy?
UK, got it'?
- Be careful.
- Ok.
She moved.
The cast isn't right.
- The face stands out very badly...
- Hey, something up?
No, no. Everything's fine.
- Sorry.
- Sit down.
- It's terrible in there, I know.
- I felt I was suffocating.
A day's work wasted.
We'll have to re-do the whole thing.
She must stay completely still.
She can't shed tears.
If the body is ok,
let's just do the head, eh?
No short-cuts, guys.
The whole body.
If you don't feel like it,
I'll get someone else.
It's all right, I'll do it again.
Closing time!
Excuse me, but this arrived
for you a few days ago.
We were going to forward it to
your home address but since you are here...
- Thank you.
- Good evening.
Forgive me, kamikaze, I forgot.
Big kiss. Your ed.
If my memory hasn't failed me,
you've got to take an exam today
on the spectral evolution of the galaxies.
Have you studied
hard enough? I hope so.
If I happened to be your examiner,
I'd ask you about
the statistical fluctuations
of the tonry-Schneider method,
because I know
you like that subject.
Anyway fingers crossed,
I'll try calling you later.
Kisses, ed.
I see here you have excellent marks.
So why the long face?
What's on your mind?
Nothing.
Not enough sleep, maybe. Sorry.
I'd like to help you.
Pick any subject, of your choice.
Statistical fluctuations
in the stellar populations...
- And the tonry-Schneider method.
- Excellent choice. Go ahead.
Impossible.
Hello Nicholas, today
is your eighteenth birthday.
I couldn't miss it,
certainly not this one.
I've no doubt you're turning
into a fine young man.
But if you've followed
your instinct to ignore
all that good advice I've given
you over the years,
then I've no worries for your future.
But a father is a father
and can't help doling out
wise counsel to his children...
Miss Ryan! This is for you.
Oh, thank you.
Sign here, please.
But I'm comforted by the fact that
I know you'll go your own way,
I have faith in you,
and your intelligence.
All you've got to do is blow on it
and it Springs open.
How many times I have got to tell you!
I'll change the lock on Monday.
It's all arranged.
Darling, I know you
too well to think
that the exam didn't go
anything but brilliantly,
so let's take that for granted.
Congratulations.
You deserve a present
but you have to go to Borgoventoso
to get it, on April the 9th
as usual.
In the envelope you'll find
the umpteenth set of keys.
Just in case!
Big kiss.
Talk soon. Your ed.
- Good morning, miss.
- Good morning.
Let you go.
And the professor?
Always late.
Let me know when
I have to come for him.
Fine, Ottavio.
Last time he wasn't too happy.
Too many people
trooping to his door.
What people?
Never saw them before.
A man and a woman,
then a younger man.
With bits of equipment.
I was never away from the pier,
waiting for you, miss, but...
Maybe that's why the professor
looked out of sorts.
Anybody here?
Welcome home my darling.
Thank you for coming today
on my birthday, as always.
Happy birthday to me,
happy birthday to me,
happy birthday dear Edward,
happy birthday to me.
But today the present is for you
so at last you can stop fighting
with your laptop.
How do I look?
Gorgeus, don't I?
Well, I'm gorgeous.
You know, all things considered,
it's the same being here
as being there.
Except that I don't get
to touch you and I miss that.
No point dwelling on this, I agree.
But remember what I said.
When I get too much for you
to deal with, you know what to do.
Your name, eleven times.
- Amy, I was expecting you.
- Of course.
It's April 9th.
I was sure you would come!
Come in! Come in!
The table is ready.
The professor was very insistent.
Everything as before.
The music, the menu, the cake.
Thank you.
We're all sorry here in the village,
but in a way we expected it.
We hadn't seen him
for months and months
and then suddenly he staid
for the whole season.
We shall look on it as one
of his longer absences.
Do you know what it was?
The last time he stayed
nearly two weeks.
There was a doctor
and I heard them talking.
Nasty word.
Astrocytoma.
You know, one day ed said to me:
"If you live with your head
among the stars
sooner or later one
will lodge in your brain."
- How did he spend his days?
- Writing, always writing.
Letters, notes, messages...
On his computer, on his mobile,
with his camcorder.
He never stopped
though he had trouble with his eyes.
He complained a lot.
Eat up, it's getting cold!
Good morning, Amy.
Hello, Angela.
- The village is more deserted than before.
- Yes, it is.
He'd be happy to know you're here.
He was a different man
when he spoke about you.
His eyes would light up.
The only time I saw him look strange
was that last day.
In the morning he went
to sit on the black rock.
He leaned his back against it.
He looked out at the horizon all day
until nightfall.
Who knows?
It's true, I'm looking at the reflection
you saw, but...
Ed!
- Ed!
- Amy, it's me.
Sorry I woke you.
- I wasn't asleep anyway.
- You've caught me in the act.
The professors was so specific:
"If Amy stays more than two days,
put this on her table, without
letting yourself be seen."
- I didn't manage too well. I'm sorry.
- No problem.
When you're out at lunch,
I'll drop by to tidy up.
Hi, kamikaze.
I'm glad you stayed on
in Borgoventoso.
You know my soul resides there.
I've never brought
anyone else except you.
I wonder if it's one of those days
when the light on the water
makes you feel you're
in another dimension.
Or if it's one of every colour
turns grey
and you feel in the world's shadow.
I've no way of knowing.
I think I do know what it is that you
have been keeping secret from me.
You mustn't get upset if I talk about it.
I would have done so,
sooner or later anyway.
Your advantage now
is that if you don't like listening
to my paternalistic ramblings
you can just switch me off,
any time you want,
get rid of me all together.
I'm talking about your parents.
I've always felt your discomfort
with this subject,
so I've never forced you,
but I think now is the time.
For you and for your own good.
Lately, your mother
has been phoning you
a lot.
And I suspect as usual
you never call her back.
Well, I have a confession to make.
After our last time together,
I went to see her.
She's very welcoming.
Don't worry, I didn't...
I didn't tell her about us.
Although, I can't rule out
that she did understand
more than I was trying to keep back.
Perhaps that's why she confided
in me so much about you
about the accident,
your feelings of guilt.
Stop it!
You think she hates you
because she'd rather you had died
instead of your father.
Is that it?
Stop it!
Amy.
She's suffering because of your
accusation. She misses you.
I know you detest me at this moment,
but I have to say this.
Now I understand why you like
to submit yourself
to that atrocity on films.
- Stop it!
- You'd like to disappear yourself,
but instead it's those
around you who vanish.
I admit, I'm not too original in this.
But I promise I won't do it again.
- So listen to me, my darling..
- Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!
One, two, three, four,
five, six,
seven, eight,
nine, ten, eleven...
What the hell's going on?! Cut!
Hey, release it.
She's got to stay there for longer.
- How many times do I have to say this?
- It was perfect, Amy.
But you need to hang there
without moving for a bit longer.
The clasp broke.
I was actually beginning to suffocate.
Come on, Amy, that is easy.
We're behind schedule,
- for fuck's sake!
- Oh, you really want me to die?
Hey, no argument, please.
We have got to do it again, all right?
- Please get ready!
- Easy, Amy, take it easy...
Yeah, Ok, "easy!"
I'm through with this!
You've pissed me off!
You go hang yourselves!
Fuck off, you bunch of shits!
One, two, three,
four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.
My darling wizard,
when you were writing your letters
and recording your videos,
you knew that, one way or another,
I'd get them and see them.
Right now I know you'll never
receive my replies
but I'm going to try anyhow.
For my own sake.
As long as you were here,
a galaxy of my life held together
to some extent,
but now it's crumbling into nothingness
and there's no stopping it.
If I have cut off
your correspondence,
it wasn't because
I didn't need you any more.
Quite the reverse,
in fact I am devoured with remorse.
Even though I flattened out the disc,
the support system is too degenerated.
I tried with a very special method.
I managed to transcribe the data,
but the content is damaged
beyond repair.
The whole thing is like that,
including the sound.
- And there's no other way?
- Afraid not. Sorry.
Ok, thanks.
Bring in the camcorder.
The whole recording will be there.
- Hey, what can I do for you?
- Hi.
It's about the deliveries you've
been making to my place
for the last few months.
Could you tell me when you got
the packages
- sure. Ryan, right?
- Yes, yes.
Ryan. Here we are.
Ok, everything was brought
in on the 10th of January.
How did you know when
to deliver the individual items?
The sender, one ed Phoerum,
left a set of delivery dates
and we just went along with his schedule.
Why? Ls something wrong?
No, no. Everything's fine.
Oh, hang on. We had three
other parcels and six envelopes
but last week we got an order
to return the lot to sender.
- What order? From whom?
- From ed Phoerum.
Hi.
Butch! Come on!
- Hello, mum...
- Amy, you never answer!
- Have you had any more dreams?
- Yes, but I won't tell you about them
because you're avoiding me.
So we're switching
roles now, is that it'?
What do you mean?
I miss your presence,
I miss wanting to keep back things
you don't know about me,
because then I can just
spring them on you,
whenever I choose
knowing that you'd have listened,
understood and helped me
as you always did.
I know how absurd it is,
but just because you can't hear me
today I want to make the effort
to tell you things
that I've never told anyone.
To be honest, your questions
don't surprise me unduly.
So what is it that embarrasses you?
Well, I've known ed
since he was at school.
When he gave me all that stuff
to forward on specific days chosen
by him, I didn't ask to...
You only gave me one package.
Why do you talk
about "all that stuff"?
I suppose you've recently received
quite a number of things from ed.
Apart from emails and other messages
that I can't even begin to imagine.
You should know everything
was dispatched from here.
But I repeat, I didn't ask to know
the content of those envelopes.
Ed was ed.
I would never let him down but,
please, I can't say any more.
Can't even tell me if
you've posted everything?
I've received notice to stop
dealing with the mail.
- From whom?
- From ed.
Or at least,
from the system he set up
to keep his will alive
but evidently not everything
went as it should.
So you still have material
destined for me.
Yes, but I can't hand it over to you,
unless ed Phoerum asks me to.
- Do you think he'll ask?
- Please believe me.
If I knew I'd tell you.
I can assure you of one thing.
In all my life I've never seen a man
as deeply in love as him.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven...
Hello?
I was just wondering
what'd happened to you.
I wasn't even twenty years old.
Dad and I took the oar to go
and see my grandparents.
I was driving.
Dad said I was managing fine
at the wheel.
He liked speed.
So did I.
Out of nowhere,
on a straight road we'd driven
on thousands of times before,
I lost control of the car.
Maybe because the road was wet,
or maybe because I was overdoing it
with the accelerator.
I went off the road.
The car rolled over down
a steep embankment.
I don't know how, but I managed
to get my door open
and throw myself out.
A clump of bushes softened
the blow and I was unhurt.
But my dad
my dad
my dad
he was trapped inside.
I couldn't do anything.
Anything-
I couldn't do anything.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
- Yes.
- I know exactly who you are
and you know exactly who I am.
- So what do you think you're playing at'?
- I'm sorry.
- It's just that...
- Ls what?
- Miss Phoerum?
- Yes.
It's me. I'm Amy Ryan.
Yes, of course.
I've seen photos of you.
And I recognised you outside
my house in January.
Nice to meet you.
Yes, January.
I was very confused.
Thank you.
I was waiting there.
I was hoping to find out
it was all untrue.
- But I didn't want to bother you.
- So, what are you looking for now?
Understanding?
- No, no...
- Consolation, then?
What would you like?
- Green tea, please.
- Nothing for me.
I don't think it was a good idea
for us to meet.
I've never thought the day would
come when I could meet you.
Because I've hated you
from a distance.
You're fully entitled to,
miss Phoerum.
Please, no need for formality,
we are the same age.
Three months difference.
You're a bit older.
It was only the existence
of my brother
which prevented ed
from abandoning us.
If I were you I wouldn't be so sure.
My mother and me,
yes, he loved us
but evidently it wasn't us
who kept him balanced.
You've nothing to say'?
Anything I say now would
be completely useless.
I can only swear that I've always
respected what ed wanted.
I never forced him
to tear his life apart.
I was happy with fragments of his time.
It wasn't easy,
but I've never hated anyone of you.
Good.
Now you can just vanish
and leave us in peace.
My father is no more.
Do you understand?
Stop searching for him
and stop sending
these absurd messages.
Ed is dead.
This is the explosion
of a supernova 1987a,
the expansion of its mass and
finally, its dissolution
into nothingness.
Professor Phoerum was thrilled
whenever he discovered one.
Could you tell me what his
last field of study was?
There's no need
for a telescope anymore,
but sometimes
the professor enjoyed it.
Look carefully.
- The crab nebula!
- Exactly.
It's still visible today since 1054.
Latterly the professor spent a lot of time
observing the crab nebula.
Why that one in particular?
Because he thought it had
the same shape as his astrocytoma.
Ed talked to me a lot about you,
in those final days.
I can imagine how much
that fed your hate with.
A bit.
But I'm gonna surprise you.
As he went on with these stories,
fragmented and mangled
by the illness,
my hostility towards you
changed into envy.
- Envy?
- Yes.
The more I heard him
talk about you,
the more I realised that no man would
ever love me in the same way.
Yes, the truth is I do envy you
and I'd like to help you,
but I don't know how.
Why didn't ed want to tell me anything
about what was going to happen?
He tried to conceal it from us too,
but he couldn't keep it up for long.
We found out quite quickly.
With you, distance helped him.
I don't know, I think he wanted
to protect you.
He tried to predict every move
in your life for three months,
so as to be at your side,
to be there for you.
He looked at it from every angle.
He wanted to show himself
immortal for you.
He almost succeeded.
- Then I just ruined everything.
- I know.
I wonder if he also devised
a way to,
to revive his communication network.
- I don't know.
He did it all by himself.
But I can give you this.
Oh, it's his camcorder.
Doctor Sobieski, who took care
of my father until the end,
he gave it to me.
I haven't even switched it on.
I can't accept the idea that you
won't give me another chance to...
To enjoy hearing all the words
you addressed to me,
and that I was stupid enough to delete.
- Excuse me, are you doctor Sobieski?
- Yes but I'm in a hurry.
You can make an appointment
at the reception desk.
My name is Amy Ryan.
Here I used to see him every day,
but I only went to Borgoventoso
at weekends, for his therapy.
Why did he stay there, so far from anyone
who could look after him?
I did all I could to discourage him
but it was no good.
"I have to organize
my future life" he'd say,
"I don't want anyone in my way"
and he'd laugh.
Did he ever talk to you about me?
Very rarely.
Offhand comments but,
believe me Amy,
he wrote letter after letter,
composed streams of emails, recorded
and edited hours of filming,
transformed the email software.
All destined for you.
He used everybody around him
as pawns right until the end.
Everyone was handed
something they had
to mail off on a specific day
to someone
who'd send it to somebody else,
who'd finally send it to you.
But nobody ever knew
what those missives contain.
Even the emails were encrypted.
A perfect plot.
And when I broke the spider's web,
what happened?
Everyone received
a telegram from ed
in which he bugged his accomplices
to send everything back to his lawyer.
Did you receive one, too?
No.
I was the only one who didn't agree
to play his game.
He took it badly,
but I left him in no doubt
that he couldn't count on me.
He knew I didn't agree with the way
he was treating his family.
Well, I hope that it didn't
compromise your friendship.
I'm a doctor.
I see everything close up.
If things go wrong
I fix them or at least
I try to, to make sure
people don't suffer.
Ed was a friend, but it didn't
stop me accusing him.
He was self-centred.
He succeeded in making everybody
unhappy his wife, his children
and in the end, I imagine,
even you, Amy.
You were right to put a stop to it all.
This plan of Ed's was insane.
Good only for a splash on the cover
of a second-rate sci fi novel.
What'll happen to all that mail?
It'll probably end up
alongside those wills
whose existence nobody
knows about.
But I've got to have those messages.
Please, help me
to convince Mr Durrell.
I know him well.
He's completely unbending.
He'd hand everything over to you only
if he received a request from ed.
Somebody cancelled
everything to make room.
I know you can work miracles
with these gadgets.
Help me.
There's one thing I could try.
But you'd have to leave me
the camcorder.
- And authorize me to get others involved.
- Who do you mean?
The intelligence service.
I've got a friend
there but you can't be present.
And if we find something,
inevitably we'll all see it.
What are you looking for in here?
I can't believe you'd give in to
one of my tantrums.
I just can't believe it.
If you even gave me the possibility
of breaking off with you, after you.
And if you know me,
you must allow me
the right to reconsider.
You must have dreamed up
some system
for letting me get back
in touch with you.
Eleven times ed, eleven times Amy,
eleven times you and me,
eleven times me and you.
Upper case, lower case.
I've tried every combination.
But it's no good.
You can't leave me
in a maze with no exit.
That's how I'd go off the road,
my love.
Understand?
We'll shoot the explosion separately.
There's no way
I'm ever doing that scene!
But the director wants you.
He'll put three cameras on the car.
You're in shot, and he's calling you
in other scenes.
- Don't go on.
- It's a great chance.
- You'd make a fortune!
- I don't care!
What's got into her?
I don't recognise her anymore.
Try talking to her, Jason.
Don't do it, Amy,
n00ne's forcing you.
UT don't take it so badly.
He's only so insistent because
he doesn't know anything.
- Maybe I understand though.
- You've changed profession.
You're a mind reader now?
There are some traces of recordings
done on memory cards,
but it's impossible to recover them
without the cards themselves.
Apart from that, the hard disc is blank.
Sorry.
- Thanks for trying.
- No problem.
You can always count
on me. I'll talk to him.
What are you looking for, Amy?
Apart from the envelope
you gave me last time,
did the professor give you
anything else?
Yes. A big envelope addressed
to a foreign lawyer, in Edinburgh.
It was stamped.
But open inside there were
some smaller envelopes.
Envelopes?
Letters for you. Numbered.
I was supposed to let you find them
in the house one at a time,
when I saw you coming to the village.
- Where are they?
The professor told me:
"I hope not, but maybe one Clay
I'll send you a telegram
with further instructions".
Dear Angela, please seal
the big envelope I left with you
and send it to the address given.
Thank you for everything.
Always. Ed Phoerum.
It arrived the day after you left,
the last time.
See how beautiful it is.
It's yours.
The professor liked these.
He used to study them.
Study and study.
Study and study.
- Study and study and study.
- Ottavio!
Did he leave you anything?
No.
But when he left,
this fell on the shore.
I've dried it in the sun.
It's not in good shape
but I've kept it for him.
Ottavio.
- The professore is...
- When he comes back,
he will get it.
Wonderful, wonderful years,
the six most beautiful years of my life.
So thank you, my darling!
Hi, Amy. I do this later.
Hi.
Sorry.
I hope you're...
Hello, Amy.
Hello, Amy!
Hello Amy, how are you?
Hello Amy, how are you?
How are you?
- If you want I'll stop the whole thing.
- No, it's Ok.
How are you?
How are you?
Not such a good day here, today.
I hope the weather's better
where you are.
I trust, let's say, you are
in a good place to listen to me.
Surprise visits
can be disastrous, I know,
but the guest always hopes
for a welcome.
Yes...
Who knows what
you're doing right now.
Who...
Who knows...
Who knows if I've managed
to make you happy.
I can't say these things to her.
No I can't, I can't, I can't.
As usual, you're right.
If it wasn't for you
I might never have gone to see her.
She was happy. So was I.
I stayed three days.
We had a lot of catching up to do.
It all felt right.
Thank you for insisting.
We've been able
to talk about you and me,
with nothing off limits,
did me a lot of good.
I felt lighter when I left.
Good night, my love.
Talk soon.
Now!
Cut! Give me a playback!
Rick! Rick!
- Rick! Come on! Wake up!
- Relax!
I'm alive!
- Excellent!
- Both of you!
- You were great.
- Thanks.
- There were at least eight of them.
- We are going to call the police.
Did they break into yours as well?
There was only one, the lady
on the third floor says.
Impossible. It was a professional job.
They work in packs.
- What happens...
- I don't know what's happening.
- Call the police!
- Someone call the police!
My apartment as well.
Cleaned out six apartments
but nobody saw them leave.
At the space-time dimensions
on the basis of which we should
all have ten doubles
dispersed in the infinity
of multiverses.
- So there are eleven of us?
- Eleven eds and eleven Amys.
Why didn't I cross
with that right away?
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven,
eight, nine, and ten.
Hi, kamikaze.
It's been too long
since we spoke
but I'm glad we decided
to make it up.
I hereby swear never to bore you
with my sermons ever again,
although I hope the last one
was some help.
If not, no matter.
But you'd better know that I'm not
gonna give up my job without a fight
as your tutor,
because I'm pretty good at that
and I suspect that you might have fallen
behind in that department.
Have you?
Ok, you're right.
Not now. We'll talk
about it another time.
You just tell me when.
I'm not completely deaf, you know.
I can still hear you clear as a bell.
I miss you.
I miss you, too.
But a bit less now,
partly because I've decided
to answer all your messages.
Take it easy, I'll try not
to go on too much.
Besides, you know,
I'm confident that one way or another,
you'll receive my correspondence.
Amy! It's ready!
Coming!
Well, as you heard, lunch is ready.
I have to go. But let me tell you
I've given up being a kamikaze.
Happy?
See you later.
I made a promise: That at the beginning
of your third lunch here
I'd give you this.
Did I ever talk to you about
the St. just library?
I'd check it out, if I were you.
I made an appointment for you
for the last Monday in may.
Try to make it if you can.
All my love. Your ed.
These are the volumes
requested by professor Phoerum.
Oh. Thank you.
You'll find the chapters suggested
by the professor marked.
Do be careful, these are rare texts
and very delicate.
I'll do my best.
Hello Amy.
I know, I never call
a pretty girl at dinner,
you never know what risk
you are running
but I had a terrible dream last night.
You were being courted
by some young men.
At first you shut them off
and then little by little
you warmed to one of them
who bore little resemblance to me
and I realised that,
this is inevitably
how things will end up,
it's only natural if I wasn't there.
So, this is why I'm ringing you:
To spoil the dinner you're having
with whoever you are flirting with.
Your jealous little scene
really upset me.
I'm disappointed
at your bad timing.
For the first time you seemed
to me out of order.
I feel like such an idiot
talking to you
knowing that you can't hear me.
You're incredible.
I wonder if I really deserve all this.
It'd have been better that
during those three months
you'd focused more on yourself
and your family.
Oh, and I forgot to tell you
that I'm getting on with my thesis,
but I doubt if I'll ever finish it.
I'm going to be an eternal
failing student.
- Apart from studying, what are you up to?
- Having a great time.
If that's the effect it's having, you'd
be better getting blown up with us.
At least you'll have a laugh.
Is it so important
if I laugh or not?
Well, yeah! If you laugh,
it means you're happy.
Good morning, kamikaze.
You're going to find
a mountain of important books.
Have fun doing whatever
research you want.
Now, by my calculations you should
already be at Saint just.
The monks should
have everything ready,
with bookmarks
at the relevant chapters.
These are the accounts...
There's somebody who makes
her happy. Lucky guy.
In other words, and without
any fear of being proved wrong,
we could conclude that in the history
of astrophysics
knowledge about the universe derives
from the study of dead stars.
The catastrophic event
that marks the end of a star,
whether it's the explosion
or collapse of a supernova,
a hypernova
or a bynar driven supernova,
enables science to understand
something, which,
on the hypothesis of the
immortality of the stars,
would remain even more inexplicable
to us than it already is.
By virtue of the relationship
between the speed of light
and the distance of billions
of solar systems from the earth,
we continue to see dead stars
even though they no longer exist.
Indeed, it is precisely their disastrous
end that reveals them to us.
An epiphany that can last
centuries, months
or a handful of seconds.
In any case it is
the revelation of a death
that occurred billions of years ago.
What scientists are doing is dialoguing
with that, which no longer exists.
What do you make of that?
Amy Ryan. Her thesis,
"from guest stars to supernovas:
A dialogue with dead stars,"
was highly commended
by the university board.
We now confer on her a degree
in astrophysics and cosmology.
First class honours with distinction.
- Oh, I'm so proud, so proud of you.
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.
- This is for you, Amy.
Or should I say doctor Ryan?
- Thank you very much.
- You are welcome.
Congratulations my darling, ed.
- Hi. Thank you for coming.
- Very well done.
Thanks.
Ah well, we could
hardly fail to be here.
- Can I introduce Nicholas, my brother?
- Congratulations, Amy.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
...but remember you still have
to earn your graduation gift.
Go tomorrow to 45
Herrmann street, first floor.
I'll be in touch soon, your ed.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
Professor ed Phoerum
has left you sole ownership
of his property in Borgoventoso.
But...
Would you now be so kind to sign
for acceptance of the legacy?
Here.
After that we can finalize the deed.
Excuse me, but...
- Does the Phoerum family know about this?
- Of course they do.
The legacy is part of the professor's
last will and testament.
Please.
Hi, kamikaze.
You don't know how happy
I am that you're here.
Who knows why,
but I don't imagine you
in the house by the fire somehow
but outside, by the lake,
or on the terrace.
Excuse my back.
I don't mean to be rude.
But the more time goes by,
the more vain I seem to get.
So today I decided
to show you my best side.
After all, even a supernova
continues to rotate in its orbit.
Although sooner or later,
in centuries or in seconds,
a moment comes when it reverts
to the nothingness
from which it was born.
And there's no way I am going
to be an exception to that rule.
So I fear, my darling...
I won't manage to come up
with any more ideas,
how to be with you.
But you know,
it's not fair to attribute anguish
and fear to a sense of nothingness.
The human mind will never
be able to grasp infinity,
not even truly understand love.
So I don't want you to cry.
There's a logic to everything.
For all I know,
at the moment of birth,
all of us possess the gift of immortality.
You'll ask "then why do we die?".
Because in the course
of our existence
we commit one mistake,
just one
but that makes us lose
the gift of eternal life.
I can already hear you asking:
"What mistake?"
It's not given to us to know
but it is because of that mistake
that human beings become mortal.
Of course you'll probably
raise the objection
that no one has ever
lived long enough
to demonstrate the reliability
of that theory
and that's true.
But it's also true that nobody has
ever been an exception to it.
Logic, logic, logic.
I understood what my mistake was.
Not everybody reaches that.
But I did.
My mistake was
not meeting you sooner.
Not being able to live
with you longer.
That seems to me
a good enough reason
to forfeit the gift of immortality.
But thanks to you,
these last three months
have been...
Beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful...
I'm trying to think
of an original closure,
but all I can come up with...
Is I love you.
Now, there's a curious story
connected with this work
it's actually the reject.
When we made it,
the model wasn't well,
she moved.
We repeated the cast,
absolute perfection.
But from that moment on
I couldn't stop wondering
why the deformed version
was so expressive,
while the perfect cast
said nothing to me.
Who knows what happened
to that woman,
but I feel what's captured here is
it's an imprint of a mysterious pain.
I'd like to have talked
to her about it.
I've tried to find her since, but
she seems to have vanished.
- That's very interesting.
- Yes, sure.
This is the first time
I see you working in white.
Is this a new direction for you?
I don't know what direction
my work is going to take.
Amy!
- Jason! What are you doing here?
- Nothing...
I thought I might find you here.
Haven't seen you for ages. You've
changed all your contact numbers.
Uhm... yeah, yeah.
You're tied up'?
Do you wanna go for a drink'?
Uhm... not tonight, no,
but I'll call you, and that way
you'll have my new number
and we'll fix something up.
Promise?
Promise.
