Once upon this same earth,
Beneath this same sun,
Long before you...
Before the ape
and the elephant as well,
Before the wolf,
the bison, the whale,
Before the mammoth
and the mastodon
In the time
of the dinosaurs.
Come on!
Now the dinosaurs
were of two kinds--
Some had flat teeth
and ate the leaves of trees,
And some had sharp teeth
for eating meat,
And they preyed upon
the leaf-eaters.
Then it happened that
the leaves began to die.
The mighty beasts, who
appeared to rule earth,
Were ruled, in truth,
by the leaf.
Desperate for food,
Some of the dinosaur herds
struck out toward the west,
Searching for
the great valley,
A land still lush
and green.
It was a journey
toward life.
It was a March
of many dangers.
Sharpteeth
stalked the herds,
Waiting to seize
any who strayed.
The leaf-eaters stopped only
to hatch their young.
Ha.
Aah.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha. Mama.
Hmm.
Mmm.

Mmm.
Mmm.
Aah!
Ha ha ha.

Some of the young
seemed born without fear.

Aah!
Yet...

Even hatching
could be dangerous.
One herd had only
a single baby,
Their last hope
for the future.
Ha ha ha.
And they called him...
Littlefoot.
Here I am.
Aw.
Ha ha ha.
Don't be frightened.
Come out.

Mmm.
Ha ha ha.
All that remained
of his herd was his mother,
Grandmother,
and his grandfather.
He knew them by sight,
By scent,
and by their love.
He knew they would
be together always.
Now, you be careful,
my Littlefoot.
Ahh.
Heh heh heh.
Aah.
Beautiful Littlefoot.
Mother, is this
all there is to eat?
Oh, i'm sorry, my dear.
The land
has been changing.
That is why we must walk
as far as we can each day
Until we reach
the great valley.
Littlefoot, quickly,
come here.
Look, up there.
A tree star.
It is very special.

A tree star.
It is very special.
It'll help you
grow strong.
Where we are going,
There are so many
of these leaves.
Come along.
Ha ha ha.
The great valley is filled
with green food like this,
More than you could
ever eat,
And more fresh,
cool water
Than you could
ever drink.
It's a wonderful,
beautiful place,
Where we can
live happily
With many more
of our own kind.
Gee, when will
we get there?
The bright circle must
pass over us many times,
And we must
follow it each day
To where
it touches the ground.
Have you ever seen
the great valley?
No.
Well, how do you know
it's really there?
Some things you see
with your eyes,
Others you see
with your heart.
I don't understand,
mother.
You will, my son.
You will.

Littlefoot, don't you
wander too far.
Hey!
Ha ha ha!
What are you
laughing at?
Oh!




Littlefoot.
Come, Cera.
Three-horns never play
with long-necks.
Pffft!
Littlefoot.

Three-horns never play
with long-necks.
A long-neck?
Hmm.
Mother,
what's a long-neck?
Why, that's
what we are, dear.
Oh. Well,
why can't I play
With that three-horn?
We were having fun.
Well, we all keep
to our own kind--
The three-horns,
the spiketails,
The swimmers,
the fliers.
We never
do anything together.
Why?
Well, because
we're different.
It's always
been that way.
Well, why?
Oh, don't worry so much.
When we reach
the great valley,
There will be
many, many long-necks
For you to play with.
Oh...I wish
we were there now.
Well, it's a long way yet--
Past the great rock
that looks like a long-neck,
And past the mountains
that burn.
Still a long way,
but we'll get there.

Oh!

Hey, hopper,
come back!

Hey.
You again? Go away!
That's  hopper.
I--I saw him first.
Well, he's in the pond.





Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

Over here.
Hey, this is fun.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

Ha ha ha!
Ohh!
Ohh! Sharptooth!
Help!
Mother! Help!



Go.
This way.
Mm-mmm.
Come back. You're going
the wrong way!
Aah!
Whoa! Ohh!
Mm-ohh!

Aah!

Aah!


Mother?
Run! Run!
Look out!
Aah!
Ohh!
Oh!
Help!
Help!

Mother!

Aah!
Aah!

Daddy!
Aah!
In this time
of the clash of continents,
A great earthquake
split the land.
Herds were divided,
families were cut in two.
Littlefoot was separated
from his grandparents.
Cera!
Mama! Daddy!
Cera was on one side
of the divide...
Her parents were
on the other.
Mother!
Mother!
Uh!
Mother, where are you?
Oh.
Mother.
Mother?
Oh.
Please get up.
I'm...
Not sure I can,
Littlefoot.
Yes, you can.
Get up.
Dear, sweet Littlefoot,
Do you remember the way
to the great valley?
I guess so, but why
do I have to know?
You're going
to be with me.
I'll be with you,
Even if
you can't see me.
What do you mean
if I can't see you?
I can always see you.
Littlefoot,
Let your heart
guide you.
It whispers...
So listen closely.
Mother?
Mother?
Mmm.
Mmmmm.
Hey!
What's going on here?

What's your problem?
You're not hurt.
It's not fair.
She should
have known better.
That was
sharptooth.
It's all her fault.
All whose fault?
Mother's.
Oh...
I see.
I see.
Why did I wander
so far from home?
Oh, it's not
your fault.
It's not your
mother's fault.
Now, you pay attention
to old rooter.
It is nobody's fault.
The great circle
of life has begun,
But, you see,
Not all of us arrive
together at the end.
What'll I do?
I miss her so much.
You'll always
miss her,
But she'll
always be with you
As long as you remember
the things she taught you.
In a way,
you'll never be apart,
For you are still
a part of each other.
My tummy hurts.
Well, that, too,
will go in time,
Little fella...
Only in time.
At first,
Littlefoot could only
think about his mother.
He hardly
noticed his hunger
And forgot about
the great valley
And that he must
somehow reach it.


Littlefoot.
Littlefoot.
Dear Littlefoot,
Do you remember the way
to the great valley?
Follow the bright circle
Past the great rock
that looks like a long-neck
And past the mountains
that burn.
I'll be in your heart,
Littlefoot.
Let your heart guide you.

Mother.
Mother!
Hee hee hee!
Mother!
Heh heh! It's you!
Wait, mother!
Wait!
Then Littlefoot
knew for certain
That he was alone,
and that though
The great valley
was far away
And the journey there
was perilous,
He would have
to find his way...
Or the chain of life
would be broken.
Cera!
Cera, hello.
What do you want?
Heh heh. Nothing.
Where are you going?
I'm going to find
my own kind.
They're on
the other side.
Well, i've looked
all over here.
You can't climb up
the other side.
Maybe you can't.
Uhh!
Uhh!
Wait! I'm going
to the great valley.
We could...Uh...
Help each other.
Ha! A three-horn...
Uhh!
Does not need help
from a long-neck.

Aah!
W-well, at least
we wouldn't be alone.
Well, when I find
my sisters,
I won't be alone,
so go away.
Three-horns can
be very dangerous.
And they only talk
With other
three-horns,
And they
only travel
With other
three-horns.
Hello.
I said hello.
What is your name?
Maybe you
cannot talk yet.
Huh? Huh?
Don't you
know anything?
Long-necks
don't talk to, uh,
Whatever you are.
Me? I'm a long-neck,
too. See?
And I have a long
tail like you.
All right...
I'm not a long-neck.
I'm a bigmouth,
but I am all alone.
I am.
I lost my family in
the big earthshake.
Um...You want
to go with me?
Yeah! Oh.
Oh, yes!
Yes, yes!
I do, I do!
Heh heh. All right.
Come on...
Ahem. But you have
to keep up.
I will keep up.
I will.

Where are we going
To the great valley.
I'm not gonna stop until
I find my grandparents.
Uh, do you think
my family went
To the great
valley, too?
Huh?
Hmm. Maybe.
My mother said
It's where all
the herds were going.
Oh, I hope.
I hope. I hope.
Ahem.
My name's Littlefoot.
Mine is ducky.
Yep, that is
what it is.
Yep, yep, yep.
* hmm hmm
hmm hmm hmm *

Don't step on a crack,
Or you'll fall
and break your back.

Heh heh.
My stomach
is talking.
Mine, too.
Hmm. I wonder what
this tastes like.
Aah!
The tree
is talking.
No, it isn't.
You should not eat
talking trees.
Nope, nope, nope.
Brlrblblrb! Oooh!
Aaooh!
Hee hee.
Aah!
Waah!
Aah!
Aah!
Who are you? Huh?
M-my name petrie.
Petrie, huh?
Funny name.
Uh, I--I flied?
No.
You falled.
I falled? Ohh!
You cannot fly?
How did you get
way up there?
I climb.
But you're a flier,
not a faller.
Hard thing to fly.
I guess it is.
We can't do it.
Nope, we cannot
do that all right.

Uhh!
Aah!
Uhh!
Uhh!
Aah!
* mm hmm hmm
hmm hmm *
Shh! Quiet.

Stay low.

Ow! Hey! Petrie!
Get off!
You got nice
flat head, flathead.
My name is not flathead.
My name is Littlefoot.
Littlefoot? Hmm.
Are you just going
to stay up there?
Yes.
Well, you can't.
Whoa!
You're tearing
my tree star.
It is very special.
Very.
His mother
gave it to him.
She did.
Ooh! Mother present
very important.
Oh, yes.
I keep safes.
Don't let
nobodies touch.
Yep, petrie,
You keep
it safe.
Yep,
yep, yep.
Nope, nope, nope.
I'm not a carrier.
Get off!
You're a flier.
Now start flying.
B-b-b-but--waah!
Waah! Aah! Aah!
Open your wings,
petrie!
Open! Open!
No, no!
No can do this!
You can fly!
Now open your
skinny wings
Petrie, higher!
Higher
like a flier!
Danger!
Where, petrie?
Th-th-there! Ahead!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Aah!
Cera! It's you!
What happened?
Why are you
so frightened?
Frightened? Me?
Ha ha ha!
Why are you
so frightened?
We're not frightened...
Are we?
Nope, nope.
Well, you should be.
I could be with
the other three-horns,
But I chose to come back
to warn you.
I met the sharptooth!
Sharptooth! Ooh!
Come on, Cera,
sharptooth is dead.
He fell down into
the big underground.
And that's...
Where he met me.
Oh! Dear,
brave Cera.
Dear, brave Cera.
Yes, I am brave.
Sharptooth is dead!
My father told me
That flatheads had
very small brains.
I was all alone
with him in the dark,
Just the sharptooth
and me.
I could
hear him breathing.
Aah!
I could see
his one big ugly eye
Looking for me.
What did you do?
Huh? Huh?
I walked
right up to him.
I looked him
straight in the eye
And said...
Aah! Whoa!
Uhh!
Ducky!
Hello.
Hello?
You should come out.
You should. You are late.
Yes, you are.
Yep, yep, yep.
Come out!
You are all alone.
Are you not
scared? Huh?
We're going
to the great valley.
You could go with us.
Yes, you can.
Uh, you are
a spiketail,
So we will
call you spike.
Ducky!
so the 5 hungry dinosaurs
Set off
for the great valley.
There had never been
such a herd before--
A long-neck,
a three-horn,
A bigmouth,
a flier, and a spiketail,
All together,
All knowing that if they
lost their way,
They would starve
Or find themselves
in sharptooth's shadow.
Hmm.
Tree stars grow
Where there's
lots of water.
If we follow
this water...
Hmm. No
green foods here,
And I still hungry.
I'm still
hungry, too.
Aah!
Can you
smell something?
I...I...
I smell...
I smell...
I smell...
Hmm. Ducky.
You smell me?
Heh heh.
I smell water.
I smell...
Tree stars!
Oh, look!
Green food!
The great valley!
I found it!
Cera, stop it!
I found it!
Earthshake!
We've got
to get out of here!
That way!
Come on! Come on!
Help!
Spike, hurry up!
Ducky, spike,
get out of there!


They're eating
our food!
Look, look what
they're doing!
They're
so greedy!
What about me?
I'm still
hungry!
Haah! You hungry?
I empty all the way
to the top.
Now we at
the great valley
And still got
no green foods.
Oh, we be hungry
forevers. Ohh!
No, petrie.
Cera was wrong.
This isn't
the great valley.
Oh, it is not
a great anything.
Nope, nope, nope.
Well,
we better go down
And see if there's
anything left.
Petrie, could you
fly up there and--
No, no!
Petrie,
do not feel sad.
It is all right.
Many things
do not fly--
Rocks, trees, sticks,
Spike.
Waah!
No!
Hey!
Ducky, push petrie
towards the branches.
Ohh!
All right, spike,
not too fast.
Whoa! Ok.
Hey, not too fast.
Hey, not too fast!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
You four
look so ridiculous.
Ha ha ha ha!
Ohh!
Ducky, petrie,
come down here!
We've got
green food!
Fly, petrie!
Aah!
Fly, petrie!
Flap your wings!
I flied?
Come on, Cera.
We've got green food.
I can get
my own green food.
See? I can
take care of myself...
All by myself.
And i'm not
afraid to be alone!
I know my way to go,
And i'm not
afraid of sharptooth!
I hope he doesn't
eat any of you.
Don't worry.
There isn't
any sharptooth.

Sharptooth! Spike.
Ahem.

There isn't
any sharptooth.

Mmm. Mmm.

Ohh!


Wake up.
Wake up!
Wake up!
Hey, stop that.
Shh! It's sharptooth.
Cera, stop it.
Shh!
He'll eat us.
He'll eat us!
Run!
Come back!
Don't look back!
Keep going!
Aah!
Now will you
believe me?
I'm sorry.
We're safe now.
Nobody's safe with you.
Look, it's the rock
That looks like
a long-neck,
Just like
my mother said.
We're going
the right way,
The way
to the great valley!
Littlefoot had been wrong
About the sharptooth, but
the others followed him.
Their only hope was
to reach the great valley,
And Littlefoot alone
knew the way.
Come on. Get up.
We're going
the right way.
We got to keep
moving up.
Oh, you can't
quit now.
What if
the great valley's
Just over the top
of these rocks?
Though they were
sore-stumped and tired,
Littlefoot urged them on.
He'd never seen
the great valley,
But his heart told him
that they were close.
Surely at the top,
they'd behold it finally.
This is your great valley?
You're crazy.
I'm leaving.
Cera, we have to keep
following the bright circle.
I'm taking the easy way
for once.
But it's
the wrong way.
Who says?
My mother.
Then she was a stupid
long-neck, too.
Take that back.
Never.
Take it back!
No!
Spike!
Spike, stop!
Don't fall!
You!
Let go of my leg!
Spike.
Take that!
Huh!
Go on!
Go the wrong way.
We never wanted you
with us anyway.
Come on. We have
to keep going.
Come on.
Cera's way is easier.
I think so, too.
Oh, flathead, wait!
Ooh! Aah! Ow!
No be angry.
Wait!
Cera, wait for us!
We're coming
with you, Cera!
Cera, spike, wait!
I--I wish Littlefoot was
h-h-here with us now.
M-m-me, too.
Spike.
Spike, do not stop.
We must stay together.
A-a-a-aah!
Aah!
Whoa! Cera, I--
Whoa! Oh, Cera,
ducky, spike! Help!
Help, Cera!
Cera, where are you?
Littlefoot!
Ducky!
Littlefoot!
Hang on!
I'm coming!
Littlefoot!
Quick, this way!
Hang on, petrie!
Help!
Ooh!
Ducky! Spike!
Oh, petrie
am so happy.
Jump, petrie!
Help, ducky!
Petrie, pull!
Petrie.
Aah!
Help!
Help!
Aah!
Aah! Help me!
Help me! Help!
Woo!
Get away!
Get away from me!
Aah! Stop it!
Let go of me! Help!
Help!
Petrie, spike,
ducky, help!
Cera, it is us.
Aah!
Ha ha ha!
I knew it was you
all along.
I knew! I did!
Oh, get out
of my way.
Cera?
Cera, come back! Cera!
Cera was still
too proud to admit that...
She'd gone
the wrong way.


Aah! Sharptooth!
It's sharptooth.
Let's get rid of him
once and for all.
What'll we do?
Look, we'll coax him
to the deep end of the pond.
He can't swim
with those scrawny arms.
Me and spike
will go
And push that big rock
on top of his head.
And then he'll fall off
into the water.
Petrie,
you whistle
When he's just
at the right spot
Where the water
gets dark.
Now we need some bait.
Hmm.
Me? Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

Hm--hm--hm--hm...

Aah!

Ducky!
Ducky!

Push, spike, push
with all your might!
Ha ha ha!
Petrie!
I flying.
I flying!
I flying!
Help!
Petrie!
I'm coming!
Cera, you're back!
Aah!
He was...
My friend.
Poor petrie.
Poor, poor petrie.
Petrie.

Stop!
You go
without petrie?
Petrie.
Oh!
Petrie, you're safe!
Yep, yep, yep, yep,
yep, yep!
Littlefoot.
Littlefoot.
Mother!
Littlefoot.
Mother?
I tried to do
what you told me,
But it's
just too hard.
I'll never find
the great valley.

Mother. Mother!
Don't go, mother!
Don't go!
The great valley.
Cera, spike,
ducky, petrie, over here!
Littlefoot,
you found it!
Yep, yep, yep.
We did it.
We did it together!
The great valley
Was all they dreamed
it would be--
A land of green,
of leaves, and life.
There were waterfalls,
grassy meadows,
Enough tree stars
to feast on forever...
And raising upon them,
their families.
This is our
new brother spike.
Mama, I a flier!
Yay!
Yay!
Daddy!
Cera?
Daddy.
And Littlefoot
Found his grandmother
and grandfather at last--
The same loving faces
he'd looked into
On the day of his birth.
Littlefoot! Come on.
I'll race you.
And they all grew
up together in the valley--
Generation
upon generation,
Each passing on
to the next
The tale of their
ancestors' journey
To the valley...
Long ago.
