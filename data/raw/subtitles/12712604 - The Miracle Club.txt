Hiya, son.
Hiya, Rosie.
Are you hiding?
Where did Rosie go?
Daniel, where's Rosie?
- Jeez, give us a look at you.
- Wash your hands.
George...
have you any money?
- GEORGE: Why do you need it?
- Pilgrimage.
What bleeding pilgrimage?
We're entering a talent contest.
The winner gets two tickets
to go to Lourdes
with the parish.
Dolly, I don't care what
you do, win or lose,
you're not taking
him to Lourdes.
- Why not?
- Because I'm out there
every day, breaking me bollocks
and you want to give
our money to the church?
- They have loads.
- We've been to all the doctors
in Dublin, and they don't
know what's wrong with him.
And some faker in
Lourdes is going to know?
Miracles happen there, George.
He could speak.
That's all we want.
We can't just give up on him.
Look, maybe he
doesn't want to talk.
That's fine with me.
- Where's Rosie? Find Rosie.

Right. Here you are,

Chrissie Aherne?

Thank you...
for contacting me.
I'm sorry I was too late.
My flight was cancelled.
- I...
- You're here now.
That's all that matters.
Let me offer you my
heartfelt condolences.
The death of a parent
is a terrible loss.
I'm fine.
- Big turnout for the vigil.
- Well now, you see,
we have the Holy Cross All
Stars Talent Contest tonight.
It's been planned for months.
It's a... it's a
fundraiser for Lourdes.
Your mother was on the committee
and she worked so hard
to make it a success
and everyone felt that she'd
want us to go ahead with it.
We kind of feel it's sort
of like Maureen's wake.
I hope you don't think
we're being insensitive.
It's fine.
May I have the keys
to the house, please?
I'm sorry, yeah, of course.
- [WHISPERS] There you go.
- [WHISPERS] Thank you.
- A lot of flowers.
- Hm.
Let me know how much it
cost. I'll pay you back.
The parish didn't
pay for the flowers.
Who did it?
Your mother's friend, Lily Fox.
- Tommy.
- TOMMY: Yeah.
Would you, would you give
me a hand with this zip?
- I can't...
- Yeah.
God be with the days
when somebody died,
the whole street went dark.
Now, look at us. We're off to
do a bloody cabaret. [SCOFFS]
How do I look?
You look lovely.
I went to visit Declan today,
asked him to bring us luck.
TOMMY: You're not
visiting our son,
you're visiting a
pile of bad memories
stuffed with rocks and statues
that don't mean anything.
I asked him to watch
over me tonight.
What do you want to be
going to Lourdes for anyway?
I've always wanted to
go there, all my life.
And look, look, I'm
running out of chances.
[KIDS LAUGHING]
- PATRICK: Can't catch me.
- I'll get you, Patrick.
You're finished with him.
- GIRL: Get back here.
- He's a waster, that fella.
The sooner you get rid
of him, the better.
I don't want to
get rid of him, Ma.
Besides, where are
you going to live?
Not here. We're bursting.
We've put our names
down for a house.
Maybe we'll get
Auntie Maureen's.
Christ on a bike! Can
we bury her first?
Where the hell are you going?
- FRANK: Out.
- EILEEN: You are on your arse.
- I'm going to the pub.
- No, you're bloody-well not.
You're minding
them kids for once.
I'm going to the charity show.
Sure, why do you want to win
a trip to bleeding Lourdes?
I'm going out.
One of these days
you'll come home,
and I won't be
shagging-well here.
Promises, promises.

Absolutely brilliant, ladies.
- Well done. Enjoy your night.
- Thank you.
Yes, yeah, thank you.
That was great, honestly.
We'll win. I know it.
I don't believe it.
Mother of God.
Who is it?
Auntie Maureen's daughter.
- Mrs. Aherne had a daughter?

Risen from the dead.
I wouldn't have recognized you.
Okay, 40 years will
do that to you.
It'll do a lot of things to you.
Well, I'm sorry for your loss.
Eileen, hi.
Mm.
Oh, you remember me. I was...
I was sure you wouldn't.
- Yeah, who forgets family?

I'm Dolly Hennessey,

Very sorry for your loss.
Your Ma was a great neighbor.
Thank you.
It's very nice to
meet you, Dolly.
- You were very good up there.
- Thank you. [GIGGLES]
How much were the flowers?
I want to pay you back.
I bought them for your mother.
She didn't think you'd be here.
Why would she think that?
Have you ever come
back in 40 years?
For the flowers.
I don't need that.
It was an honor. Your
mother was a saint.
Well now, who'd have thunk it?
Maureen's daughter, and
coming all this way.
And only a little bit late.
Yes, but it's great
to have her back.
Marvelous, absolutely
bloody marvelous.

No, my love.

She's going to help

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
Wonderful service, Father.
It came to me all of a sudden,
Maureen's ticket to Lourdes,
it's terrible for
it to go to waste.
I have this lump on my breast.
I see. And have you been
to the doctor with it?
Oh, no.
I want to go to Lourdes.
Since poor Maureen is gone,
she'd want her ticket
put to good use.
I'll see what I can do.
Bless you, Father.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Your Ma asked me to give you
this in case you came home.
MAUREEN: "Dear Chrissie,
if you are reading this,
it means you came
for my funeral,
so thank you for that.
I remember you
saying when you left
that you'd only come
back when I was dead.
Welcome home.
I don't know the pain and
the joy that you've known.
I guess I don't really
know you at all,
not the you that is
reading this today.
But you're here, and
that tells me everything.
I've been saving
for a very long time
to come and see you in America.
I always wanted to see Boston.
We are more alike
than you think.
We both carry our
pain too proudly.
I know you have no love
for Lily Fox or Eileen.
I don't blame you for that,
but it's a heavy load to carry.
I've left something for you
in the top drawer of
my dressing table.
I'm sorry for what I said.
I'm sorry for what I did.
The last words you
hear from a mother
shouldn't be angry ones.
I love you, Chrissie,
with all my heart.
God bless."
- [KNOCKING ON DOOR]
- Hello, hello?
How are you, Chrissie?
My mother is dead,
I'm in a place I swore I
would never come back to,
everyone is happy
as ever to see me,
so overall, I'd
say, yeah, mixed.
You seem a little cross, maybe.
You think?
- From my mother.
- Thank you.
Put it to good use. Just
do not give it to the nuns.
This is your mother's
voucher for Lourdes.
Give it to someone who needs
it. I don't need a cure.
Not everyone goes to
Lourdes for a cure.
No?
What was she looking for, then?
Reconciliation.
[♪]
I think she'd like you
to go in her place.
Take the voucher.
I don't need it.
[DOOR OPENING, CLOSING]
Chrissie wanted you to have it.
You didn't tell her
about my lump, did you?
No, no, no, no, no.
Strictly between ourselves.
Congratulations. You're
coming to Lourdes.
[EXHALES IN RELIEF]
[EILEEN] It's a
service of gratitude
to God and Our Lady.
Service of gratitude
to my bleeding arse.
It's one big gimmick to
squeeze my money out of me.
Do you not know the
"Song of Bernadette"?
FRANK: No.
- How does it go again?
- It's not a song, it's a film.
It's about St Bernadette
and how she saw the
Blessed Virgin at Lourdes.
You're not going to
no bleeding Lourdes.
I have to go, Frank, please.
You got something
all of a sudden?
Course not.
You're not going on any
holiday in the French Riviera
with Father Too Good-looking
for his own bleeding good.
You think I can't
see what's going on?
I'll be helping Dolly and Daniel
and the other poor unfortunates.
[SCOFFS] Unfortunate,
that's a good one.
What about me? I'm
the unfortunate one.
Who's going to have to do
the cooking and the cleaning
and minding the children?
Not me, I can tell
you. That's your job.
Will you go and
sell that ticket?
I'm not selling it.
Sell it! Sell it to
some poor unfortunate.

You can't go. I won't allow it.
- I'm going.
- What'll I do on me own?
I'll be back before you know it.
Now, will you stop
making me feel bad?
- What if something happens?
- Go back to bed, Tommy.
You'll be safe there.

Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy, will

Don't you get talking to

Who? Chrissie?
EILEEN: What the hell

I think she just wanted a break

I'll tell you what she's up to.
What?
Father Dermot, that's

It appears I am
sharing with you.

Isn't it beautiful?
Is there only one bed?
Your Ma wouldn't have fussed.
Well... [LAUGHS] I
am not my mother.
Ain't that the truth.

Show some respect, Chrissie.
This is a holy place.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Father's taking
us to the grotto,

See you downstairs, Lil.
Right.
Whatever the reason you came,
it wasn't to sit
in a hotel room.
DOLLY: I wasn't
expecting all this.
All what?
- Selling.
- Selling.
Yeah.
You'd think it was Liberty
Market back in Dublin.
I suppose.
I thought our Lord
hated all that
when he chased them
out of the temple.
Hard to believe
though, isn't it?
Her coming after having Jesus
to coming here to Lourdes?
And France, like.
I mean...
Why did she suddenly show
up after all these years?
I'm asking myself
the same thing.
[♪]
What you got there, Daniel?
DOLLY: Look!
Ah. It's so pretty.
I'll treat you, Daniel. Not
a word to Frank, you hear?
And I'll have 12 of

LILY: Mother of God!

watching her poor son...
crucified.
She's picked a good place
to stand, all the same.
- What?
- So, we could all see her.
Oh.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
Do you believe she
really came here?
The Virgin Mary picked
this spot and that girl?
Yes, yes, I do.
Whether she did or
not, is unimportant.
You might want to

Wonder what that
one came here for.
Well, maybe our
Lady brought her.
I think she's nice.
So is her clothes.

Would you stop staring?
People hate to be stared at.
Look, isn't it beautiful?
See, that's where all
the crutches used to hang
from all the miracles.
We'll find a miracle
for you, Daniel.
Daniel, Lily's talking to you.
It's all right,
love, never mind.
God, imagine though.
What?
If we seen one happening
right in front of our eyes,
a miracle like.
I think I'd die if I
seen people get up,
throw their crutches
away and walk.
But it might not be
crutches, Eileen.
Other things get cured, too.
Tumors and things you can't see.
EILEEN: Now, that's right.
How do we know there wasn't
hundreds of them cures?
Sure, look at Lily over there.
What about Lily over there?
Well, you don't need a crutch.
Excuse me?
EILEEN: For your leg. You
don't need a crutch to walk,
so if you got a cure now
you wouldn't have a crutch
to put up on the wall.
I didn't come here looking
for my leg to grow longer,
for God's sake.
I wouldn't know what
to do with myself.
In fact, I'd probably
lose my balance.

[TELEPHONE RINGING IN DISTANCE]
Here, I'm gonna take
this up to Daniel.
Blackberry.
Not like there is at home.
Want to taste?
We used to pick blackberries.
You and me, and Declan.
We'd lie on the grass,
and we'd eat them,
and we'd brag about
our future, and...
[EXHALES] ...oh, God. We
were so full of ourselves.
Declan and you...
- and me.
- [INDISTINCT CHATTER]
I never heard you
come in last night.
You must have been late.
Well, I'm glad I
didn't wake you.
EILEEN: Talking
to Father Dermot?
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY] A priest.
You always did love a challenge.
[CHUCKLES]
Declan could swim like a fish.
Makes you wonder how
he, of all people...
- would drown.

Her leg was hurting

CHRISSIE: Are you

- [WHISPERS] No.
- You okay?
It's just me leg. You go ahead.
I'll catch up with
you's all later.
So, it's...
- You look pale.
- I must have overdone it.
You seem to know
what you're doing.
Chrissie, Chrissie, the
baby. What happened?
Your pulse is normal.
I think we need to
get you a wheelchair.
Now, you need to take it
easy on that leg today.
I'll go fetch a chair.
Yeah.

Now, be strong.

[BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH]
[VISITOR SCREAMING]
- Is that someone dying?
- It's the water.
- They say it's bitter cold.
- [VISITOR CONTINUES SCREAMING]
Jesus.
They're not stepping in
the same water as us,
- are they?
- Oh, of course, they are.
But that's a bit much.
We'll be catching infections.
Oh, no, you won't catch a thing.
This is Lourdes.
It's another miracle.
Our Lady told everyone
to come and bathe...
- [SHOUTS IN FRENCH]
- in the miraculous water.

- [SPEAKING FRENCH]
- That's the man!

It's a miracle.
He's after walking.
It is a miracle.

We're only here five minutes

Get Daniel in.

I believe you had

The poor crippled

Ah, no, false alarm.
Every day we have one.
- Really?
- Every day.
But only the men.
Always the men.
You know what men are like.
But the real miracles like,
how many a day would you get?
- [INDISTINCT CHATTER]
- [BIRDS CHIRPING]
You're all right, Daniel?
[PANTS]
- DOLLY: Daniel!

Daniel, did you say something?
Say it again. Come on, come on.
- CHRISSIE: Dolly...
- You can do it. I'm listening.
- Just give him a minute.
- Say, Ma.
- Ma. Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma.
- Dolly.
We should try again, maybe.
Oh, he only touched the water.
If we could get
him all the way in.
CHRISSIE: Dolly, just...
just look at him.
Let him tell you what
he's trying to say.
[♪]
[CRIES] I'm so sorry, my love.
So, sorry.

Stop it. Dolly,
it's just not true.
[SNIFFLES]
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
- Well, that's that then.
- What?
Guess how many miracles
there is after being.
- How many? What?
- Sixty-two.
- Sixty-two.
- That's very good in one day.
Not in a day.
Well, in a week,
that's still very good.
Not in a week...
since she first
appeared in 1858.
1858?
Oh, it couldn't be.
I have to tell you, I'm
very disappointed, Lily.
Frank was right. It's
all a bloody gimmick.
[♪]
FRANK: Oh, that looks lovely.
Lovely bit of stew.
There you go. Now, uh...
want a bit more?
No, it's really good
for you, you know.
Oh, boy. Uh, eat.
I said eat.
Mm-hmm.
Well?
- It's good.
- Mm-hm.
[CHUCKLES] It's
hardly burnt at all.
[KIDS LAUGH]
Excuse me, you always expect
a certain amount of burn
with the stew.
- Ugh, I can't eat it.
- [KIDS LAUGH]
- That was a bit curt.
- [KIDS LAUGHING]
A little abrupt.
Come on, eat up.
[CHUCKLES] I didn't know
you had it in you, Da.
- Hm.
- FRANK: I... I don't.
I... I made it up
as I went along.
[KIDS LAUGHING]
It's not as good

Well, nothing is as

Were you never a child?
We used to skip to it.
You're in Lourdes now, Eileen.
Don't you dare
lecture me, laddie.
Dragging people halfway
around the world,
only to disappoint them
when there is no miracles.
It's a con. It's a
sham. You're a conman.
Come on, its bedtime,
Eileen. Come on.
Palling around with
Chrissie Aherne.
If you ladies forgive me,
I'll... I'll... I'll...
I can't believe you's, Eileen,
carrying on like a corner

I'm sorry. Sorry, Lily.
- [CRIES] Lily, I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's all right.
It's all right.
- Come on, we'll go to bed.
- [WHISPERS] I am sorry, Lily.
I just want to go home
and be with my kids.
Come on, now.
Apologies, Father.
Why did you leave
and never come back?
Leave?
I was banished, Eileen.
You were there. You remember.
And who told them
about the pregnancy?
You were my best friend.
You were the only one I told.
Why didn't you give the baby
to the nuns as you was told?
- Come on, Eileen. Come on.
- EILEEN: Don't start with me...
Pretending all these
years it was an accident.
It was the guilt
that killed Declan.
You killed him with the guilt.
- LILY: Apologies, Father.
- It's okay.
Poor woman.
Her condition at present
though, it's hardly surprising.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

Dolly.
- Dolly, just breathe.
- [SOBS]
- Here. Come, come sit.
- [DOLLY SOBS]
[SNIFFLES]
I have to make a confession.
I'll get Father Dermot.
Oh, I don't think he'll
come after all that.
Well, I have to confess me sin.
What sin, Dolly?
I ruined him.
What did you do?
Did you smack him,
Dolly? We all do that.
- You get overwhelmed.
- [EXHALES DEEPLY]
No.
The trauma in the womb...
what I done on him.
What did you do?
I tried to miscarry him.
[EILEEN SIGHS]
Oh, that's old
wives' tales, Dolly.
None of them work.
Between ourselves, I threw
myself down the stairs
more times than I
had hot dinners.
[SCOFFS]
Thank God, they came
out the same way.
What one did you do, Dolly?
[HESITATES]
I can't.
LILY: Oh, it's best you
get it off your chest.
You'll see yourself,
it's probably nothing.
Now, how... how...
how did you try?
- [SOBS]
- Just leave her alone.
- She doesn't wanna say.
- But I want to tell.
- I have to confess.
- No. No, you don't have to.
Guilt is killing
her, isn't it, Dolly?
See?
Go on, Dolly, love.
- I filled the bath with water.
- Dolly, don't tell them.
You can tell us, Dolly.
You filled the bath up
and then what happened?
It was freezing,
just like today...
and then I got the whisky.
Whisky?
Five bottles.
Five bottles?
You could have killed yourself
drinking five bottles of whisky.
I didn't drink them.
What did you do with them then?
I poured them in the bath.
- [GASPS]
- What did you do that for?
[SOBS] You know why. I
sat in it to make it pass.
That's how I know
I done it to him.
You didn't do anything, Dolly.
Sure, I mean...
he's perfect, Daniel.
You didn't do anything, Dolly.
It has to be boiling water.
[SIGHS] How do you
know, Chrissie?
Because when I made
it to Boston...
my landlady...
she knew.
She knew I was sick every day.
I think she was used
to girls like me.
She told me I couldn't stay...
and she gave me a
name and an address.
So, I went just a
few blocks away...
and this woman...
she gave me pills.
She gave me something to drink.
[CRIES SOFTLY] She
did what she had to do
and then...
she put me in a bathtub.
The water has to be boiling.

Chrissie.

Oh, thank you.

Declan...
told us you were...
[BREATHES DEEPLY]
you were leaving.
He...
God, he loved you, Chrissie.
He wanted to marry you...
have the baby with you.
I should never have meddled.
It's because... it's
because of me...
- he's dead.
- Oh, Lily.
- [BREATHES DEEPLY]
- [LILY SOBS] Oh, no.
We lied to him.
Yeah, we were ashamed.
We lied.
I lied.
I told him...
you were going to America
to find a better life...
and that you'd done with him.
And it destroyed him.
I destroyed him as sure
as I gave him life.

LILY: Now, I'm old, Chrissie.
I'll be dying...
soon enough.

No, your mother, Maureen.
I was hoping she might...
tell me what to expect,
you know, when I...
when I got up there.
If I get there, I don't
suppose I deserve that.
I mean, I...
I haven't believed, you know?
Not properly, not
since, Declan, you know?
But I... I... I
didn't have the heart
to say that to your mother.
No.
Well...
you wouldn't have wanted
to take that away from her.
She loved it. [CHUCKLES]
All the hocus pocus.
Well, there's always
hope, isn't there?
Um, even... even when you
don't completely believe.
Peace...
that's what I hope for.
Peace.
I'm glad you came
home, Chrissie.
Your mother would
have been so proud.
I've... I've no right
to ask you this, but...
can you ever forgive me?
Thank you.
[KISSES] Thank you, Chrissie.

- [BIRDS CHIRPING]
I'm sorry about
last night, Father.
I don't take it back.
You're, uh, what
do you call it...

You don't come to Lourdes

You come for the strength

is no miracle.

Have you been to a doctor?
Why can't people like
us have miracles?
Why can't I have a miracle?
I go to Mass.
- I come to Lourdes.
- We'll go together...
to the doctor. We'll
find you the best one.
I'll go with you.
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah. [SNIFFLES]
