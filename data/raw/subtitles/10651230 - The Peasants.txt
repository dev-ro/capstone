Look, Kuba!
They're flying away.
Hanka! Come over here!
God's blessed you with
a good potato harvest.
Aye, indeed!
She said the baby
had a spud nose.
The spitting image of Boryna!
No!
Many a young lass
would chase after him!
They had no room for her!
Neither in hallway or barn!
Just like mine!
The plague-ridden
scum. Her own children!
Come get that wool your
mother left, Magda.
Why? Father won't hand over
anything, even her clothes.
Jagna, come!
So dressed up!
What a necklace you've got!
Just some alder branch
I found, I cut it and...
Beautiful and talented!
A rich widower for this one!
I'm not rocking
someone else's cradle.
There's nothing to worry about!
His are already weaned.
I'm fine where I am.
Fine or not, one day you'll
have to fly the nest.
The husband you get,
the farm you get.
And the woman you become.
I don't care about that.
Don't talk rubbish, Jagna!
She's young still; Says
whatever comes into her head.
And don't think that you
can slink off to the Inn!
You'll feel my whip if you do.
Come on, Mama!
And you?
Don't you cause
me worries enough!
What did I do?
Talking back to
the Mayor's wife!
Do you want them to
speak ill of you?
I didn't mean to offend her.
I'm just happy here with you.
My dear child.
What's going on at Boryna's?
I'll not be ringing the
bell for her funeral;
Clink your pots instead.
Daddy! Rosey is dying!
Jambrozy has bled her. Nothing!
Then we put melted
wax down her throat.
Still nothing!
Our best cow!
Devil twist your guts if
that's how you mind her.
You're always ready
to eat my food,
but lend a hand - never!
I've been out digging
potatoes all afternoon!
Like you ever notice a thing!
Scum! Wasting such a beast!
What?
Snivelling again! It's
all you're good for!
Leave her alone.
- Don't attack my wife.
- And you're no better!
What do you ever do
for this household?
What am I? Your farmhand?
I work like an ox for
nothing. Not even a good word.
Shut up before I lose my temper!
You live on my land, eat my food.
Too much bread's making you bold!
Don't reproach me with the bread
I'm owed by my forefathers.
Passed to you as you should
now pass it on to me.
I doubled this land
with these hands.
And while these hands
can work, it stays mine.
If you don't like it,
try your luck elsewhere.
Maybe on Hanka's three acres
you can eat fresh rolls daily!
I'd even eat mouldy potatoes, if
they weren't thrown in my face!
Father wants you
to cut up the cow.
I'm no butcher.
Must you always fight with him?
He's your father.
For us, for our children,
make peace with him.
Come on, Antek.
You make peace if you want.
But don't tell me what to do.
With no mistress in the house,
things drain away,
like through a sieve.
Time to marry!
And that's that!
You're joking!
My wife is scarcely
cold in her grave!
The whole village would talk!
Eat, eat!
Listen, Boryna!
There are so many
unwed lasses here,
that when a man goes
about the houses,
he smoulders hot as a stove.
Take Zo≈õka,
slender, a hard worker,
and not a bad dowry.
She's a grumpy shrew,
and has one thick hip.
What's he need her dowry for?
Isn't he the richest
farmer in the village?
Well, Weronika,
Staszek's daughter.
Taken.
Roch's son sent her
vodka yesterday.
Jagna Dominikowa?
A fine lass!
Jagna?
They say she chases the lads.
Oh yes?
Seen her have they?
People gossip just
for the hell of it.
Take care!
I'll be back.
Don't worry!
God bless.
Is your Jasio off
on his studies?
He'll be back soon
enough. I shouldn't fuss.
He's going to the seminary,
to be a priest.
You've brought herbs!
Thank you. Give your
mother our blessings.
The priest talks so well of her.
Such a wise woman.
Wait. I'll give you
something for these.
Mother said there's no need.
Don't be silly! I insist.
Poor thing.
Its wing is broken!
Will you take him, Jagna?
I can't. Father would
kick him out, for sure!
Take Storky.
I'll cure him before spring.
I'll feed him and everything.
Take him!
Do take him, Jagna!
Maybe I could find room
somewhere in the barn.
Hatching some plan, are you?
Antek, don't tell father.
Why would I, Jozka?
Better be off, father's
looking for you.
You really want
this scrawny thing?
I really do.
Have you heard?
The Squire's driving
everyone's livestock
out of Wolf's Hollow!
All that land, the scum! And he
begrudges us our grazing rights!
They say your son-in-law
means to take you to court.
That bloody blacksmith!
Running amok, the lot of
'em! Coveting what's mine.
They might back off if
you were to marry again.
I'll not take the first
lass to cross my path.
Throw in a gift of land, and even the
very best of them won't hold back.
For land, like sows to a trough!
Are the boys any different?
Always sniffing around,
like dogs, for a dowry!
They say the squire wants
to sell Wolf's Hollow.
He can want all he likes,
but we have wood gathering
and grazing rights there.
Sue him then.
Who has time for the courts when's
there's so much work before winter?
How true! The burdens we bear!
Three notes!
Ladies boots! With
laces and heels!
And greased with fat!
It's a good look for you!
How much?
Three notes.
I'll take it.
You'd make a fine farmboy!
Or not.
I'd hire you in an instant.
I'd be too expensive.
For some,
but you couldn't be
too expensive for me.
And I wouldn't
work in the fields!
I'd do all the work for you.
Jagna!
Take this.
I bought it for you.
Pure silk.
- I can't!
- Take it, Jagna.
And when some young peasant brings
round the vodka, don't drink it...
Why be in a hurry?
I said seven!
Six and a half! It has blight!
Your face will be
blighted after I punch it!
The wheat's pure as gold!
People are saying I
should take you to court.
Go ahead!
Give Magda the land
that is rightfully hers.
I'll not take it to
the grave with me;
But while I've
breath in my body,
I'll not give up a single acre.
Then pay us the value,
of those two acres.
Enough!
A man has a need for money when
he's on the lookout for a new wife.
Sure!
If I choose to, I'll marry.
Any objections?
Objections? No, but...
I might even send
vodka tomorrow.
Do so!
Why would I mind?
But give us the calf at least,
Rosey's one,
and I'll even help you.
You'll help,
will you.
Jambrozy!
Come, drink with us.
What are you thinking
about, Jagna?
Oh, nothing much.
How's the stork? Better?
Better, thank you.
I'd like to hang
onto those clouds,
and float far away with them.
I'd go with you.
Would you like that?
There were two people,
and both were young.
Day by day, night by night,
there was hunger,
there was passion,
And both were young.
And from their
whispers, came a...
Shut it!
Sounds like you're
being skinned alive.
came a child!
Day by day, night by night,
there was hunger,
there was passion,
and there came a child!
There were two people,
and both were young.
Day by day, night by night,
There was hunger,
there was passion,
And both were young.
And from their
whispers, came a...
Did you hear that tomorrow
Walek is sending vodka
to Ala Paciotkowa?
- Is she already old enough?
- Barely, but she's got so much land
that lads are in a hurry.
They'll line up for
you too for sure!
If your daddy doesn't
spend your dowry
on a new wife first!
Stop spouting nonsense.
Father only buried
mother in the spring.
What does that matter to a man?
Every one is a pig,
always ready to
thrust his snout,
into a fresh trough.
Come on, Jagna! I'm
soaked to the bone.
If you meet Antek,
tell him to hurry!
Hail Mary, full of grace...
Hurry! Let's hurry!
Move, come on!
Come on, girl! Come on!
Go!
Move your arse!
Jagna!
Jagna!
You shouldn't have loaded
so much on one horse.
I'm not doing two
trips in this weather!
We'll push. On three.
One, two... THREE!
Go on! A little more!
You're clear now, Szymek!
God be with you,
Antek, thank you!
- Jagna!
- You go on!
Hanka is waiting for you!
I'll walk you to
the Mill, Jagna.
The water has caused
a breach there.
It got so dark, hasn't it?
Are you afraid?
Why would I be?
You coming to the
cabbage party tomorrow?
Go now!
They are waiting for you!
Will you come?
I will!
Hey!
Off with you!
Ala and Walek got engaged!
She'll be a beautiful bride.
She bought such pretty
ribbons at the market.
Beautiful for a day.
Until they chop off her
plaits at the unveiling.
Then the lad will
have a surprise!
Jagustynka, never a
good word for anyone.
What? I'm just
telling how it is.
It comes to all of us!
Let's have 'em, let's have 'em!
Colourful as a field of flowers!
All dressed up, the
lasses, like a wedding!
Planning on marrying
cabbages, are you, girls?
Did you hear that
Mateusz is back?
They say he built the Counsellor's
house all by himself in just 6 months.
He made us a new
hen house in a day.
He's an able craftsman!
Able indeed!
I'll bet he'll be able
to make something new
pop up in the
village in 9 months.
Lukasz!
Play some music!
Well, ladies, all this work
must be making you thirsty.
Jagusia, some bread and lard.
Give me some!
For you, and for you!
I don't like the taste of vodka.
One for you, Jagustynka.
Your health!
Your health! Your health!
Bravo!
Bravo, musicians!
Thank you for the hospitality.
- But I have to run now.
- You didn't even eat anything.
Mother's expecting me.
God be with you.
God be with you.
That one's me.
Flying before all others.
No.
This one's like you.
So bulky he might
fall out of the sky.
And then he'd crush
some pretty girl below.
This is you.
I'm like dirt to you?
No...
You are like holy soil.
That brings life.
You bring me to life.
Yes! Come in!
Praised be.
Praised be.
Mark you that a man of
importance has come to see you!
- And why!
- I'm listening.
You're a wise woman.
So you know that
sooner or later Jagna
has to leave home.
I am bringing this from the
first farmer in the village.
Shall we drink to that, Mother?
Drink away, but you
haven't said yet who it is.
Who?
Why, Boryna himself!
An old widower!
Old? But recently in court
for fathering a child!
True
except it wasn't his.
Of course it wasn't!
A farmer like him with
a wench like that?
Let's drink, mother!
I could, but he's more likely on his
way to having a beer with angels above.
Then what? The kids
kick the stepmother out.
No, that's not for us!
A bride's price!
Maciej promised a
land settlement.
For Jagna.
I...
the Mayor, swear it.
Well
we'll think on it.
Drink, Jagna.
Drink.
We've got you a man
as solid as an oak.
You'll be
the first lady of the village.
Drink up!
I said, drink.
Drink, Jagna!
- Jagna!
- Leave her, mother.
I told you already, Mateusz!
You did, you did
what did you tell me?
To let me go!
I just want to talk to you.
Be quick. I've work to do!
Your mother wants to sell you.
Like a heifer on market day.
You'll go with the old man?
If she tells me to, I will.
Do you think I have a say in it?
You do!
Just tell her
what you want!
Sure.
That's easy for you to say.
Jagna.
- Back from the world already?
- I'm back.
- Mother.
- A bitch was your mother, not me!
Why've you come? There's
nothing for you here!
I've come to see Jagna,
not you.
Stay away from
Jagna, do you hear?
People have maligned her enough
in the village on your account!
I'll sign over those three acres
next to Michael's to her.
Her late father left her
five, and one of forest.
Match that and give her six!
What!
Those by the road are best,
where you grow potatoes.
Those are the pick of my fields!
And isn't Jagna the
pick of the village?
I suppose.
But God in heaven, six acres?
That's more than a farm to most.
No one'll take it as
long as you're living,
and remember the
fields from her father
will be yours,
you can sow them immediately!
Your health!
Play musicians! Let's dance!
You're on Father's side!
I'm on the side of order.
Paid you off well, has he?
Not from your pocket.
Oh it's from mine,
son-of-a-bitch, mine!
You've taken enough already,
so you're not in a hurry!
Like that calf he just
gave you? Is that nothing?
You could have taken it too.
Except I'm not a thief!
I'm a thief, am I?
Hey, hey!
I'm a man of office!
Easy, Antek, or you'll be sorry!
And you're nothing but a drunk.
A Judas and an embezzler!
I bet he paid you both
well to defend him!
It seems to me, Antek
that it's not the land
that's bugging you.
- What then?
- You've been chasing after Jagna,
and now you're sulking.
Leave him!
Antek!
Leave him!
And on the second day,
when all the people had left,
and Blessed Virgin,
and the Holy Apostles were gone,
only the little dog was left.
- And he sat and howled...
- Do you ever shut up?
Why are you jumping
down her throat?
Your health!
Your health.
You've signed over a
whole six acres to Jagna!
Because I chose to.
And if I choose, I can sign
over everything to her.
You could, if it
belonged only to you.
Who else's is it?
Who else's, tell me!
Ours.
Fool.
The land is mine,
and I'll do whatever
I want with it.
- We won't let you take what's ours!
- Hark at her!
Brings us three worthless acres of
sand, and now she's giving me lip!
If your lot is so bad here,
go find something better.
We're not going anywhere,
because our land is here.
Give it to her if you want to.
But divide the rest
among your children:
Antek, Magda and Jozka.
Look at her, now she's
dividing up my land!
We only want what's just!
You'll get justice at
the end of my stick!
Lift a finger against
her and you'll not live
to see your wedding day.
Six of our best
acres, settled on her!
Mother's clothing,
her beads, everything!
And for who?
For who? For that dirty sow!
What did you say?
She's a dirty whore,
and all the village knows it!
- The whole world even!
- Don't you dare,
or I'll beat your
foul mouth to a pulp!
I'll say it too!
That your Jagna's
a common whore,
you hear me?
Whoever wanted her, had her!
Antek!
For the fear of god, lads!
Stop! Stop!
Enough!
Enough, enough!
A worthless bitch.
You're just too old to realise
that you've paid more
than others would.
Leave.
Come sunrise, I don't want to set
eyes on you in this place again.
Why so gloomy?
Don't be like this with Boryna.
Be soft, be gentle
maybe he'll settle more land on you,
or toss a pretty penny your way.
I don't care for pennies!
There must be something
more important in life.
Have you no fear of God?
Foolish girl.
Look.
Look!
Your settlement from Boryna,
six acres of pure soil!
Do you think that you'd be
happy without that holy soil?
God did not create
you to be poor!
No!
Love comes and goes,
but land stays.
Welcome! Drink people, drink!
Drink, my dears!
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Eat something.
Look at her! A grand lady!
The first lady of Lipce now,
and she sits there
like at a funeral.
She's overwhelmed!
She's a beauty though.
I'll give her that.
Why wouldn't she be,
when all she does
is sleep and eat.
And lies behind every bush
with anyone in trousers!
Zoska, in the name
of the Holy Virgin!
This is no place
for such gossip!
I give it 'til spring,
she'll be bored by then
and chasing farmhands.
Her mother was just the same!
Jagustynka!
Aren't I right?
She prays away now,
because she's wrinkled
as a potato after winter!
But she fell to her knees for
other reasons in her youth.
Now, she'll feel at home.
And help herself
to mother's things.
Let's drink!
We'll fight for what's ours.
One! Two...
Look, mother! How
beautiful our Jagna is.
There's never been such
a wedding in Lipce,
nor will there be again.
Ah! Jagna, my beauty!
I have to rejoin the guests!
Aww... What a hostess!
- Drink, young lady!
- Bottoms up!
Your health!
I hear they are
hiring at the mill.
I told you already!
I'll not work for
the peasants here.
Maybe
I could work there.
Don't be daft, dad!
Antek, we're living
on potatoes and salt.
I won't work in Lipce!
It's more than three weeks
since anyone's spoken to me.
You fought with your father.
Don't other lads fight
with their fathers?
Maybe, but you're the only
one whose father is Boryna!
Let them spit on
me. You want that?
It's not about what I want,
it's about what we need!
And the old man,
he boils her milk,
makes her tea.
Brings it to her bed.
He can wait on
her hand and foot,
but Jagna will go back to
her old ways soon enough!
I heard that she's
frisky for her stepson.
Nah!
All the gossip about them
knowing each other is not true!
I heard
that he'd whine at her door,
and she had to chase
him off with a broom!
Many a time she
complained to me.
- Wasn't I in her bedroom more than once?
- Not the first, nor the last!
You're lying.
What did you say?
You're lying, you scum!
Boys!
Stop!
Antek!
Mateusz!
Jesus, he's gone straight
under the wheels.
If anyone else bothers Jagna,
they'll get the same.
Mateusz!
He's alive?
He's alive!
He's alive!
- Beautiful!
- It's not!
Witek, is the stove hot yet?
I'll bring more wood.
Close the door!
The cold is getting in!
Master Jasio!
Praised be Jesus Christ!
For ever and ever.
- I bring the altar breads.
- Welcome, Jasio!
Good day.
Back from school already?
Since Sunday, three days ago.
What's new?
Everything goes quietly
with us peasants, as usual.
Quietly?
What about your wedding?
There was so much fun
that people were
dancing for three days!
Look at Jagna's cutouts!
Very beautiful.
Truly.
- I passed Antek.
- Oh yes?
He's grown so thin.
He looked weary.
Weary indeed.
He wore himself out
while breaking Mateusz's ribs!
Thank you for your hospitality.
And... Merry Christmas!
Goodbye, Jasio!
God be with you, Jasio!
What's going on? Why
were they fighting?
Why,
over you, of course.
Like dogs over a bitch in heat!
- You're lying like a dog!
- I'm telling the truth!
Mateusz was boasting
to the peasants
that he spends time
in your bedroom.
So Antek near beat him to death!
Worry not, love.
Antek would fight
the world for you.
- Happy Christmas!
- God be with you!
Happy Christmas!
Did you see, Maciej, what
we sent with the farmhand?
Ah, yes, fine work,
Michal. Thank you.
I see you're wearing
mother's hat.
It suits you.
Let's go.
Jagna
come to the floodmeadow one day.
- I have a husband.
- Yes, you have.
My father.
Can you change that?
Easy...
I come in peace.
You shamed me in front
of the whole world.
You beat me so badly,
they even summoned the priest!
But I am not holding a grudge.
Why were you lying to the lads?
I only said those things
because I was angry...
What's Jagna to me now!
Welcome!
- Welcome!
- Praised be!
Praised... Are
they in the alcove?
Come, Jagna.
Forget about it
while you still can.
How can I?
When it runs through
my bones like fire.
Don't I know it!
Didn't I chase after her myself?
But she preferred you.
The Squire has no right!
Yet he's sold logging
rights in Wolf Hollow!
Lipce has always
had rights there!
He owns the wood.
But we will seek a compromise.
What compromise?
The forest is already sold.
They've marked the trees,
and they'll start cutting.
Let him mark them, we
won't let him cut them.
We won't let him.
- Every day I wait.
- You think I can leave? They watch me.
Play the volta, boys!
And make it lively!
I was only dancing.
He'll weep someday...
- Move!
- I was only dancing!
- Move!
- Leave me!
Stupid.
Decorates the house, but
she's blind to all dirt.
Because it's clean.
Maybe the illness has
gone to your eyes.
I swear, when I get
up, you'll regret it!
Shush, Jagna!
Go and see if Jozka needs help!
Come on, it's not her fault.
Then whose?
You left her alone and went
drinking in the backroom.
The music was playing,
everyone was dancing,
having fun.
So...
So what was she meant to do?
Stand in a corner
like some old maid?
Just cure me and don't
give me life lessons.
I know well enough.
Hanka?
Hanka!
For the love of God, Hanka!
Stop by some time.
- Even tomorrow.
- You drove us out.
So how could I come to you?
I can't let you and my
grandchildren starve.
In the cherry orchard,
walked a pretty lass,
searching for her
lost innocence.
It's the revellers!
The revellers are here!
Fire...
Fire!
Fire!
People, fire!
Jagna's apron!
Gimme, gimme! Keep working.
They say that Boryna
caught them in the hay,
and that's when
the fire started.
Antek did it, for
sure, out of spite!
Did you see it?
Did you see him light it?
Then what are you
blabbering for?
I heard the old man beat her so
badly that she's still lying ill.
- I said it would end this way!
- That's enough!
Quiet!
I see you've been begging.
Since you make us live like beggars,
I seek compassion elsewhere.
You have no shame.
Is it father's?
I told you, damn it!
Not to go to him.
He invited me, so I went.
I won't let me and the children
go hungry because you don't care.
Take it back! Now!
I don't need anything from him!
But the children
do, and so do I!
Take it back!
Or I'll take it and
shove it down his throat!
He can choke on his charity.
Try it!
Touch it and you'll see!
He bought you cheap.
With a crust of bread
like a stray dog.
You've sold us even cheaper.
For a scrap of Jagna's skirt.
Go on!
Run to your bitch!
Lipce must fight!
Today they took our wood.
If we don't defend ourselves,
tomorrow they will
snatch our land,
our houses,
possessions...
Slaves of the Squire or Boryna,
what's the difference?
For God's sake, Jagna,
stop your nonsense!
It's no wonder he's
punishing you now.
He's made of flesh and blood,
not paper like your cutouts.
He's your husband!
Not one I chose.
Do you love me?
Haven't I said so?
Don't I come out to see
you whenever you want?
You love me indeed.
Like some mad dog who can bite,
and you can't get rid of!
I have to go now.
If I've gone to the dogs,
it is because of you!
Because I loved you.
Do you understand?
You love me?
You only take it out on me!
What?
You need another already?
You think I ever wanted you?
Boryna's farmhand?
People!
We have suffered an injustice!
An injustice we cannot tolerate!
We have rights in Wolf's Hollow!
The forest is ours! And the
Squire is cutting it down!
We complained - in vain!
We took the Squire to the court!
Justice was denied us.
But enough is enough!
They are cutting down our wood!
- Are we going to let them?
- NO!!!
We must defend what's
ours ourselves!
Look, it's a mob!
Fetch the horsemen.
Don't be afraid, people!
It's our rights, our
will, our justice!
All together, people!
Follow me, people!
To the forest!
To the forest!
Don't just stand there! Attack!
Jagustynka, take women
and smash their shacks.
Horsemen!
Watch out, lads!
Come on, lads!
Rally round, don't give up!
Son of a bitch!
Get the horses!
Boryna!
Father!
Show me Anton Boryna!
Soldiers.
Father!
Is that you, my son?
It's you...
He was defending his father!
Justice is on our side!
You're all
under arrest!
Father.
- I am sorry!
- Stand up!
You're coming with me.
We fly to thy protection,
O Holy Mother of God;
Do not despise our petitions
in our necessities,
but deliver us always
from all dangers...
I thought only peasants
are up at this hour?
Folks like blacksmiths don't
need to get up at dawn.
With father ill, and Antek
and the rest in jail.
I thought I'd check...
- If you need anything.
- No need, thanks.
I'm keeping my eye on
things, as father asked.
Four eyes can see more than two.
- I'll wait until Jagna's up.
- Wait all you want.
Get out, Hanka!
Quiet! There's a sick man here.
Not that you care.
He could be starving to death
before you'd lift a finger.
You heiress.
My husband is my
business, not yours.
The whole farm would go to ruin
if you had the running of it.
That's why father
put me in charge.
And go feed that
whining cow of yours!
Father didn't say anything?
Jesus!
- Michal!
- Sorry, Jagna.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I came to see how father is.
Did he say anything?
No.
The organist told me that
Father has a lot of cash.
He probably hid it
in the storeroom.
Let's split the money evenly
before Hanka steals everything.
Just give me the key, Jagna.
Hanka has the keys now.
Don't turn your back on me
when I'm talking to you.
You doing the
shopping now, Jagna?
It would probably
be easier for you
if they let Antek out?
I can make enquiries.
I have influence.
Come.
Sit down with me.
We'll figure it out.
If you have such influence then
why are the men still in jail?
Just for defending
what's theirs?
Don't sulk, Jagna.
I am on your side!
I can help with Antek.
Keep cranking!
Hanka!
Why are you yelling?
You hung that over my bed!
That was the only place for it.
Doesn't it suit you?
If you get hungry, you
can rip a piece off.
Since you always take
what others worked for.
Let her go, if she
wants to fight.
Try it, bitch!
I'll scratch that dainty face so even
your own mother won't recognise you.
Ha... Hanka!
Hanka
throw them out.
Are you in pain?
Throw them all out.
In the storeroom. In the wheat.
In the wheat barrel.
You will find some
money. Hide it!
So they don't take it from you.
Save Antek.
Don't let them take it.
It's yours.
All yours.
You said you could help Antek.
All in good time.
Come, Jagna, come.
Let's rest here.
- Look!
- There's nothing to see here.
Come here, Jagna, come now...
I'm sorry.
I got carried away.
Touch me again, you pig, and
I'll tell the whole world.
Tell them...
As if anyone would believe you.
Come, farmer.
Time to sow.
Time to sow...
Time to sow...
Dear God, giver of
salvation and forgiveness.
We ask for your mercy to
take Boryna, your servant.
By the grace of the Virgin
Mary and all the Saints.
To you, with eternal blessing,
For Jesus Christ,
our Lord, Amen.
Come to me...
So, what's new, Hanka?
Everything is as usual.
Plenty of work to be done.
As usual?
You took father's money?
You would steal it and you
think everyone is like you?
What you've stolen is yours.
But the land must be divided.
I'll not give it up.
I'm just minding my husband's
property. I've no rights here.
Now that father's dead,
Antek is in charge.
It's all up to him.
In charge of his
prison cell, maybe.
But honest people will
make the decisions here.
Honest! Look at him!
You're only looking to
grab as much as you can.
Oh, poor little thing.
Sitting pretty on six
acres of our finest land.
You're right, Hanka.
Let's wait,
for Antek to return.
He can settle with this harlot.
I wish I'd broken my legs rather
than ever enter this house.
No one's tied you down. You
were free to leave anytime.
And don't spit at me. After
all you've done to me.
What have I done?
Stolen things? Killed somebody?
You chased him like a bitch in heat.
When you knew he had a wife and children.
Oh, I chased him, did I?
You don't see his faults?
How he was pinning at my door
even for a glimpse of my shoe.
It was he who befuddled
me, and did as he pleased.
You want the truth?
But you'll regret it.
If I would want him,
no matter what you do
he'd kick you out,
and follow me all
over the world.
Remember this and don't
think that you are my equal.
Get out of this house now!
Get out!
Don't let Antek turn
away from us again.
Here! Is this what you want?
These acres?
Take them then,
and I hope you choke
on them to death!
Jagna.
Don't touch me.
You had something
to say. So say it.
Don't be afraid of me! Jagna!
I hardly recognise you!
Well, as you left me, so I am.
I never left you.
I was thinking about
you day and night.
Maybe you had something
else on your mind?
Yes, I did.
- I was thinking of how you disgraced me.
- I disgraced you?
Did I tell you to
become my stepmother?
Did I force you to run
around with the Mayor?
Jagna.
Would you go out into
the world with me?
Antek, no!
What a drought!
We were so worried about you.
Happily Hanka managed
to bail you out!
Worried, were you?
Of course!
You are the first farmer now.
Two sacks for you, mistress.
Hanka.
How easily the
inheritance falls to you.
Now you only need to kick out
Jozka and all will be yours.
Got your eye on Jagna already?
- She's only just widowed.
- I don't.
Just saying Hanka had no
right kicking her out.
- It was Jagna's home.
- It was not.
It's back where it
belongs, with the family.
Are you sure?
Her mother has filed
Jagna's claim at the court?
They'll get her property back.
We'll see.
Jagna.
People are complaining
about you in the village.
Let them bark.
They're hot and bothered
and it makes them angry.
You know...
The lads
are already queueing
up to bring you vodka.
Let them drink it themselves.
Not all lads are alike.
Maybe it would
help
in the village...
If you chose someone.
It would stop people's
tongues wagging.
I don't need help from men.
I've had enough of
their help already.
Jagna, my dear child.
Haven't you slept?
Why did you reject Mateusz?
He's a good carpenter.
Wasn't that Jesus's profession?
He has his past,
but so do you now.
I don't want Mateusz.
- I don't want any man.
- Don't talk like that!
You need to go to confession.
You can do penance and with
time people will forgive you.
I won't go to confession.
Fear the Lord, child.
Praise be to God.
Praise be, Hanka.
I'm going on a pilgrimage.
Please forgive any sins
I committed against you.
God bless you for
your kind words.
But what's done is done.
I ask you from my
heart for forgiveness.
I don't hold a
grudge in my heart.
I'll pray for you.
Jagna?
Don't you recognise me?
How could I not recognise you?
It's just that you look so
elegant now, so different.
Clearly coming back
from the world.
Right now I'm
coming from my home,
to get a bit of peace.
- And you?
- Just wandering around.
Is that a holy book?
No, it is about faraway
countries, and oceans.
Jesus! About oceans!
Have a look!
Look!
See this pyramid?
It's higher than five of our
churches stacked on each other!
It must be a mountain!
And what are those?
They look a bit
like my cut-outs.
I saw how beautiful your cut-outs
are when I visited at Christmas.
I haven't seen cut-outs as beautiful
as yours in the markets of Warsaw.
They've been looking for
you everywhere, Jasio!
- All over the village.
- I must go.
Interrupted your
prayers, have I?
Goodbye.
A secluded place,
far from people's eyes.
May your foul tongue shrivel!
So I rush off to search,
I look around, and...
Excuse me, Jasio lost his book.
What a nerve!
Get away from here! Never
show your face here again!
I'll not shed tears
because of you,
like Hanka and the Mayor's wife!
I'll teach you not to
conduct your little romances.
You'll remember me, you hussy!
To your kennel, bitch!
I heard that Jagna's now hanging
around the Organist's son.
Were you so lonely in prison
you've taken to women's gossip?
I'm only repeating
what people are saying.
Tell me who said so, and
I'll set them straight.
I won't give a single zloty!
Five thousand is missing
from the district's treasury.
They're taking everything
from them. The whole farm!
- And if that's not enough,
- Lipce has to pay the rest!
I'm not going to pay anything!
People, quiet!
Don't you know how the
Mayor spent this money?
- On Jagna!
- That's right! Of course!
You saw that, did you?
Don't I know it?
Am I not ashamed to have
a whore in the family?
Do something.
She bewitched my man.
He'd buy her anything.
- Whatever she wanted.
- Everyone saw it!
Where did she get those dresses?
Because she was Boryna's wife.
She got all the fancy
clothes from him!
What do you care?
Why are on her side?
Mother of God, save us!
She even tried to
seduce my Jasio!
The innocent boy ran
and told me everything!
What a horror! Not
even a priest is safe!
Look at the poor
harvest we've had!
Surely, a whore like that
has brought God's
wrath upon the village!
- Time to have end it!
- There's only one way!
Throw her out!
- Of course!
- That's how it must be!
Everyone agreed
to exile Jagna from the village.
Say what you think
about it, Antek.
Well, Antek,
we're all listening!
With your father gone,
you're our first farmer now.
We can't decide without you.
I live in the village,
and I stand with the village.
You want to expel her,
then expel her.
You want to put her on
the altar? Then do that.
It is all the same to me.
Antek!
Good.
Now we must sort this out.
Do you know what
they'll do to Jagna?
The law's
on their side.
To hell with such law.
What they're accusing her of
it's not true!
Will you stand against
the whole village?
- Are you on their side?
- I'm on no one's side.
I care for her as much,
as I care for dirt.
Jesus!
That you should
dare to kick out a person like
a mad dog.
Antek!
Your word means something.
It's too late.
Mother, the whole village
is coming to get her!
Quick! Close the door.
Jagna! Hide!
I'm not hiding from anyone.
Together, lads!
One,
two,
three!
People! People!
What are you doing?
Leave Jagna alone!
Out the way, mother!
Mama!
Grab her!
You'll pay for everything.
Oh, you'll pay, you whore.
What now, hussy?
Not so pretty anymore!
Take her out!
To the cart!
This is for the wrong
you've done to my child!
Take this, slut!
- Get her down!
- Bitch!
For the shame you
brought on the village!
Get her on the cart!
Tie her up!
Take her!
That's enough!
Come back to the village,
and we'll hunt you
down with dogs.
