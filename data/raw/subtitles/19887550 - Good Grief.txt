[man] So, Alisdair went away to Berlin
for a week
and came back talking about
all this great art he'd made there.
I'm playing supportive partner,
and I ask him where it is.
He says, "Where what is?"
I'm like, "Well, you do mixed media,
I run a gallery."
"I'd love to see this great art
you've made."
- Okay.
- [Thomas] It's a short film of him
and this hairy older Cuban man having...
very slippery sex on a greased-up tarp
in what looks like an empty shoe store.
- Putting the eggnog down.
- Marc, they made seven short films.
- Did they have sex in all of them?
- It's to do with the eroticism of greed,
or capitalism,
or something cloyingly well-intentioned.
Joke's on me if I stay.
- So you're gonna break up with him?
- Mm.
- No. No, it's too much hassle.
- [laughs]
- I'll just let him do it eventually.
- [sighs]
Are there any decent men in this city?
Thomas...
- Oh.
- ...how many times do I have to tell you?
You don't get to chime in on this
because you've made your own eggnog.
And your hot, wealthy husband
is about to lead a sing-along
by a roaring fire.
So... that question was intended
to just float there for a second.
[laughs]
It's the only box with your name on it.
[woman] Oh. [sighs]
I didn't know this was a gifts thing.
I forgot to bring wine.
Don't tell Terrance I told you that
because we got in a fight about it
on the way here.
Oh yeah. Considering we practically
share my husband,
I thought it only right.
Marc doesn't deserve you.
- You know that, right?
- [chuckles]
And listen,
if things go south between you two,
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll be right here.
Okay. Well, I'm sure
Terrance will be happy about that.
- Oh, he'd understand.
- [grunts]
If this is a check for my rent,
I swear to God...
{\an8}- [Sophie] Mmm.
- [Oliver] Incoming.
What the fuck are these?
Oh.
Well, those are hand-crafted maracas.
After last year,
I thought it would be nice
if you could still participate
in the carols.
- [chuckles]
- Do you know what? This is actually abuse.
That song that you picked last year
wasn't in my key. Not on me.
My love, your voice is like a church organ
someone threw out of a window.
[Marc snickers]
Suing this household
for emotional damages actually.
- Empty threats, empty threats.
- [Sophie] No.
- What are we suing for this time?
- I think it's high time I put me first.
Oh, as opposed to all the other times
you don't put yourself first?
- Thank you.
- From your husband.
I'm being silenced.
Why would you do that to her?
These are actually really beautiful.
Thank you.
Honestly, the gaslighting
around my singing is unbelievable.
- [Marc] Ooh.
- No, no, no.
You are absolutely tone-deaf.
And loud.
Really fucking loud,
and I love you for it.
How many drinks have you had?
None of your goddamn business.
Give me that.
- Okay.

of everyone's attention, please?
Daddy.
[all laugh]
We all know what time it is.

Yeah!
So, come. Jackie, darling, would you get
the sheet music off the piano
and pass it around to everybody?
You should also have received,
and I know you have,

You should shag the barman.
I saw him eyeing you up.
Probably because he's never seen
a single human eat so many sausage rolls.
[Oliver chuckles]
And I'd rather shag you, if that's okay.

Because, like, you've got that.
Me and you break up,

- What have I got?
- Oh, honey.
So Terrance asked me to move in with him.
That took long enough.
Yeah, I haven't gotten back to him yet.
Why?
Ah, too clean.
I feel like I can't be myself there,
do you know what I mean?
No.
Be yourself, like what? Live in squalor?
- Throw garbage on the floor?
- Maybe.
If that's what I wanted to do, you know?
Hey, babe.
Talking about you.
Cool. We're, uh, talking about you too.
[Marc] Hmm.
If only you could see

[Oliver] Lily Kayne
has gone and had her tits done.
- [Marc laughing]
- And the studio is having a meltdown
because Victoria Valentine
now has implants.
What do they expect me to do?
I write the books, they make the movies,
and you, my love,
redo our gorgeous kitchen.
- [Marc] I redo the kitchen?
- Mm-hmm.
I redo the kitchen
on top of illustrating all of your books,
and doing the covers,
and fending off
throngs of sobbing teenage girls
knocking on our door
wondering when you're going to finish
- the next two books you promised them.
- [Oliver laughs]
[Oliver] I owe you my life,
Marcus darling.
[Marc] I know you do.
[Oliver] And thank God
for those teenage girls.
[Marc] No, not tonight. Not when they're
taking you away from your own party early.
[Oliver] It's our party,
because you planned it knowing full well
that I had a book signing in Paris
in the morning.
[Marc] It's a signing.
You could have pushed a signing.
[Oliver] You don't push a Christmas
signing at the Louvre, my love.
Have I told you
how handsome you look tonight?
[Marc] Not enough, honestly.
Tell me the piano got tuned.
- [softly] The piano got tuned.
- Mmm.

[Marc laughs]
- [softly] Replaced.
- [exclaims]
[grunts] I have longed for people before...
[Marc] Mm-hmm.
I've loved people before
But not like this
It was not this
Give me a world
You've taken the world I was
Did you just come up with that?
- No, Anne Carson.
- Ah.
I'd give up this house
to have written that.
[Marc] Well, we don't want that.
We just redid our kitchen.
[Oliver] Too right.
[gentle music continues]
Thank you for the party.
[woman] Oliver changed
so many people's lives.
Especially mine.
I remember reading
part of the first Victoria Valentine book
for my audition for the film and thinking...
"This character
is why I wanted to be an actress."
She's strong.
Smart.
She's a truth-seeker.
Literally.
She's telepathic.
But I'm sure you all know that. [chuckles]
And now he's gone.
And my heart breaks.
For his family.
And for our movie. [cries]
All of us wondering,
"Why? Why did this have to happen?"
He had so many more stories to tell.
But life fucking sucks.
Now we don't know if we'll end up
shooting the fifth and sixth movies
because he was still writing them.
So...
Oliver...
you little slut. [chuckles]
Okay.
I hope the studio green-lights them
in your honor,
and that we get to continue to tell
your stories for many years to come,
because we...
need them.
Oliver's first word was "move."
As in, "Out of my way."
He can't have been more than one.
I was blocking his path
to our little back garden and, uh,
he was determined
to get to the snapdragons.
He loved squeezing their heads,
making them talk.
He didn't know it at the time,
but he was telling stories,
even before he could speak.
Growing up, he'd share his writing
with his mom and me.
Always about princesses
in search of things.
Um...
I've been thinking a lot these days
about all the times I encouraged him
to write about something else.
Something boys would write about.
He was, uh, quite defiant.
"I'm a boy."
"And this is what I want to write about."
I can hear him now,
scolding me for underselling his stories.
I, uh... had a tendency to do that, and, uh...
he'd be right.
It's not...
a light thing...
to know that your child succeeded
in spite of you.
I only wish I could have told him
how much I regret
blocking his path to the snapdragons.
I hope you're having a laugh
with your mom up there.
What I wouldn't do
to take your place, son.
I love you.
And I'm proud of you.
I'm so...
proud of you.
[tender music playing softly]
[Thomas] I've always loved your sketches.
How many times
have you promised me new work?
There'll always be space for you
when you're ready.
[exhales heavily]
Thank you for coming to stay.
Well, it's a huge burden...
- [Marc chuckles]
- ...to get to use your kitchen
and sleep on an expensive
memory foam mattress,
- but you said you wanted company.
- Mm-hmm.
[exhales]
You okay?
So, that's a yes. [clears throat]
- She's just through here.
- [Marc] Thank you.
Thank you for coming in.
Of course.
So, before we get into everything,
I wanted you to be aware
that Oliver's publishers
are trying to get out of his deal,
as he won't be delivering
his next two books.
It's been a month.
People are disgusting.
It's a big advance.
But yes, the Americans
have never been known for their tact.
Lawyers are on it.
We'll have more for you soon.
Okay.
[woman] And you?
Haven't been sleeping?
[Marc] Mm.
[inhales deeply]
I've been, uh, reading that
the brain is like a muscle.
That's why getting over a death
is so hard,
because your brain has been trained
to feel things for a person.
And when they go away,
your head is still operating
under the impression
that it should feel those things...
for that person. Like...
muscle memory.
So I'm just trying to train my brain
to not feel as much for right now.
Just to get me through the next year
so that I'm not constantly reminded
of the fact that I am now both an orphan
and a widow-er.
Why, does it look like
I haven't been sleeping? [scoffs]
I think we'll hold off on the will
for today.
[gentle music playing]
- I'm going to murder you for this.
- You got this.
You have got this, babe, I believe in you.
[man] All right, guys.
All done setting up the bars.
Bring yourselves over here,
we'll go through
what we're going to do today.
Sit on the ankles.
Good. On the third rep,
pause at the bottom.
Hands on the inside of the knees.
Good. Lovely. In this position,
I want you to cough for me.
[all coughing]
Feel your abdominals.
- Nice. Are you okay?
- She's not doing it properly.
No, you might need
to just check your pose,
- lift your chest a bit higher.
- [snickers]
Oh, no.
Slowly back down.
- Good. One more. Up.
- [mouthing] I love you.
[man] Breathe in on the way down.
Down.
And stand.
[imperceptible]
So my hair's just like yours?
So I want to be just like you?
I want to understand it.
- I want to... a lot of different guys...
- [Thomas chuckles]
...party until 5:00 in the morning?
You know, it's almost Shakespearean,
if you think about it,
the levels of betrayal,
and yet they continue
to show up to these dinners.
[TV continues indistinctly]
[gentle music continues]
What do you mean I have to pick a song?
It's a dating app.
The song plays
over a montage of pictures of you.
Well, is there... Thank you.
Is there an option not to?
I mean, what kind of songs do people pick?
Radiohead. An awful lot of
creative directors picking Radiohead.
It's only been six months.
He doesn't have to do this.
Thank you very much.
Toni Braxton, "You're Makin' Me High."
Works every time.
- [laughs]
- [Marc] How do you know?
- Nabbed me this one, didn't it? Hmm?
- [Thomas chuckles]
[Terrance] It was the pictures
that worked for me.
I can assure you it was the pictures.
Although, had I known
what I was getting myself into...
Anyway, I had a legendary slideshow.
- Men love a thong strap, God love them.
- [Thomas] Mm-hmm.
Aw, you've kept his nudes.
- [Marc] Give me that.
- [Sophie] That's so sweet.
What? It's fucking romantic.
I'm sorry, I was just
looking for photos of you,
and I can't find any of you
alone without him, and I...
It feels weird cropping him out.
Do I look older to you?
I feel like I've aged a lot.
- No...
- [Sophie] Yes. Your husband just died.
You're allowed, my God.

Oh, and, uh... I ended things with Terrance.
What? What happened?
[Sophie] It was a long time coming, Marc.
You know, and I'm feeling good.
Feeling great, actually.
It was bringing me down. All of it.
I just... refuse to be trapped

I just can't be his kind of wife.

Terrance proposed?

Apparently, they've just broken up.
What?
It's not it. Heart said no. Get dressed.

I'd stop by this art thing,

On your birthday.

I'm reading the card.
Oh my God, that fucking card
hasn't been opened yet.

- [Sophie moans happily]
Can you be in love with a couch?
[gentle piano music playing]
[Thomas exhaling]
[grunts] Sophie is taking
the guest bedroom
and is demanding privacy
as a 35-year-old single woman.
Didn't she share a tent
with a bunch of strangers at Burning Man?
Yeah, she wears logic
like one of those little handbags
that can't actually hold anything.
[chuckles]
- You okay?
- Yeah.
[chuckles] Yes. Yes.
[sighs]
It's nice.
["Heartbeat" by Annie playing on speakers]
[gasps] I got a date for tonight.
[Thomas] What?
Thomas, before you pass
any kind of judgment,
you're coming with, he's bringing gays.
- Bringing gays.
- [Sophie] Mm-hmm.
Why do straight people
think their gay friends
will automatically
want to sleep with each other?
I set you two up,
and it worked, didn't it?
Yeah, for a year, 15 years ago.
[Sophie] His name is Sebastian,
he works in advertising, he's 6'1".
He spends an awful lot of time
on expensive boats,
according to his profile.
I told him you'd pick the place
since you're paying.
I'm not paying for that.
Oh, Marcus.
I'd very much like for Sebastian
to forget his fucking name
when he sees me tonight, okay?
So I think we should
start making that happen.
Like, now.
ASAP.
- Things took a turn.
- Yep.

- [Marc] Hi.
- Hi.
Um, I would like to exchange this, please.
Thank you.
This is for Oliver Alston?
Yes. Oliver Alston bought this.
He spent a lot of money in this store.
Probably hit on you.
[woman] Do you know what happened to him?
It's so sad.
He would bring us coffees
when he'd come to shop.
You wouldn't happen to remember him
coming in here
with another man, would you?
[clerks speaking French]
[in English]
Um, there was a boy sometimes, younger.
Younger than you.
Um, maybe a boyfriend, I don't know.
Uh, are you his assistant?
I'm his husband.
And Oliver bought this for that boy,
uh, just before he died.
Died in front of me,
and not the boyfriend.
Now, I have friends upstairs that
would like to buy something in the store,
and I'd like to help pay for that
with this item.
So if you could please make an exception.
Unless you'd like to watch me
slowly unravel in the store.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
[Sophie] Too intellectual?
Or just... intellectual enough?
Nice balance.
Smart dress.
And there's you in it.
[laughs sarcastically]
[sighs]
One day, my love, a man is going to melt
that cold, cold heart of yours.
He's just going to take
a hair dryer to it, I promise you.
I love those glasses.
And the scarf. Get them both. Why not?
[uplifting orchestral music playing]
[Marc] I loved that apartment.
- You loved that flat?
- I loved that apartment.
You two broke up five months in.
I know. Now look at us.
I think about that apartment
a lot, actually.
Do you think about the day we moved in?
- Oh my God.
- What did you find again?
- A homemade dildo behind the bed.
- [Sophie shrieks]
- [chuckles] What was it again? A shampoo...
- Perfume bottle, yes.
It was a perfume bottle that
someone had wrapped in a condom.
In their defense,
those women had a reputation
for being very messy
and forgetful prostitutes.
Legends.
Are you ever going to talk about Terrance?
See, that's the problem.
Everyone wants to talk about Terrance.
I want to talk about me.
- [Thomas] Hmm.
- Okay.
Let's talk about you.
Thank you.
[Thomas laughs]
Okay, well...
I want to ride that thing at some point.
And I want to have fun tonight.
I want someone to look at me
like I'm fresh out the box.
Is that too much to ask?
No.
You liked that flat?
I remember one night
when Soph had gotten back from that bar
that she worked at that one summer,
- and you and I were in a good place...
- [Thomas] Mm.
...and we'd won that Elton John CD
- from the pub quiz across the street...
- [chuckles]
...and we put it on
and we opened all the windows,
because that place was like a steam room,
and we all laid on the bed
just hoping for a breeze.
And there was a moment
when the bass from those guys downstairs
remixed perfectly with
"This Train Don't Stop There Anymore."
- You remember the weirdest shit.
- No, and we were all convinced
that we were having
the same heat-induced hallucination.
But we weren't.
It was just a beautiful memory
in that apartment.
Was that the night I spilled my red wine
over those awful pointy shoes
you wore all the time, and you cried?
- [laughs] Fuck off.
- [laughs]
[chill music playing on speakers]
[man speaking French]
- [in English] How do I look?
- [exhales]
Like you didn't pay for that dress.
[Marc laughs]
Oh, here he is.
- Bonjour.
- [Sebastian chuckles]
- [snorts]
- [Sophie chuckles]
That's all the French I know.
These are my friends, Marc...
- Bonjour.
- ...et Thomas.
- Just Thomas. Thomas is fine.
- [laughs]
- [Sebastian] This is Esme...
- [Marc] Hi.
- ...and Remi.
- Bonjour.
[Remi and Thomas] Bonjour.
Bonjour.
- Oh.
- [laughter]
- So, what are we drinking?
- Wine.
Mmm. Excusez-moi.
So how do you all know each other?
[Remi] We work together.
Um, I start yesterday.
You've known these people for a day?
Yes, but, um, Seb asked the office
who wanted to get laid tonight
and I thought, "Why not? It could be fun."
- You want?
- Okay. Yeah.
Oh. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mmm.
Seb told me your husband is dead.
Um... he is, yeah.
That he was killed.
Mmm.
He was, yeah.
Not, like, murdered though.
- My uncle was murdered.
- Oh my God.
He work in construction.
And we later found out
he was mixed up in the mafia.
Burned alive.
Wow.
I'm... I'm sorry.
Yeah.
You must miss him.
- It's complicated.
- Yeah.
- Love is that way.
- [chuckles]
[waiter speaking French]
[in English] Are you ready to order?
[gasps] Yes, I want meat.
["Sortir ce soir" by Étienne Daho playing]
I have a very strong point of view,
you know?
And I will not apologize for that.
I can't keep working under people.
I need to take charge of my life.
What is she doing?
[Sebastian] You need to do
what makes you feel good inside.
- [Sophie] Exactly.
- And only you know.
Only I know.
Okay. All right.
In theory, okay,
but I thought I'd have my own gallery
by now. That's also life.
Sometimes you do things you don't wanna do
to get to where you want to go.
No, no. You don't get it.
You don't get it. Mm-mm.
Does he not get it,
or are you not willing to hear him?
Says the boy who worked for his husband.
[laughs]
Okay, I will not feel bad
about working with my husband.
Lily fucking Kayne would not have a career
if it weren't for my illustrations, so...
Babes, babes, babes,
I would kill for what you have.
Own it.

- [crowd exclaims]
- [applause]
[waiter speaking French]
[gasps] Who ordered these?
[Sebastian] You did.
- Send them over.
- That's just what you need.
[Sophie] Okay.
To doing what makes you feel good inside.
[hiccups]
You're going to find out
what a good singer I am.
I can't wait to see that.
[Sophie] Fabulous.
- [Sebastian] Are you?
- [Sophie] Mm-hmm.

- Your tongue is blue.
- [chuckles]
The drinks were blue.
And I'm only just realizing how this
must look to someone I've only met once.
I'm not normally like this.
Besides shoving your blue tongue
down my throat...
[snorts]
- ...and knocking my head against the wall...
- Mm-hmm.
...you're not that bad.
I don't know what that was.
It felt sexy.
It felt like a sexy thing to do.
Would you like
to give your tongue some air?
Yeah.
Give me a second.
- [laughter]
- [Sophie] Mmm.
You all right?
[Marc chuckling] No.
[whines]

- [Marc] Yeah?
Where are you going?
- [Marc] I'm gonna go for a walk.
- No, sit down.
[Marc] No. I'll be right back.
I'll be right back. Have fun.
[Theo] Come on.
I thought I wouldn't hear from you.
I also thought that.
But things change.
- Oh, wow.
- Hmm.
- What changed for you?
- A lot.
I guess I felt... lonely.
I don't know if that's a rude thing
to say to you.
Why is it rude?
Well, I feel like I might take offense...
to that.
I... Like, the only reason
someone wanted to get in touch
was because they felt alone
and wanted company.
Like the reason
for getting in touch wasn't...
romantic enough, it's practical.
And what's wrong with that?
You were lonely, you thought of me.
I think that's kind of romantic.
These days, everybody needs a parade
to show how much they care
about each other.
[Marc] Well, a lot of people are insecure.
Like, you're not very confident
without being arrogant,
which is a very hard thing to pull off.
[Theo] I think arrogant people
have something to prove.
[Marc chuckles]
Don't we all have something
to prove to somebody?
Yeah, sure.
I'd just rather be upfront about it.
I think a lot of people would like
to be upfront about a lot of things.
But honesty doesn't just
spill out of a lot of people.
It should.
[waiter speaking French]
Merci.
[in English] They haven't changed
the recipe in 65 years.
- Mmm.
- [Theo] Hmm.
How are you feeling now?
I'm all right.
If the waiter came by and asked you
what you thought about the soup
and you said, "All right..."
[laughs]
...they would ask us to leave.
No, they would probably be asking us
why we're eating French onion soup
on a date.
Is this a date?
I don't know, you tell me.
You seem like a very transparent person.
What does it mean?
That you don't look like you lie a lot.
I don't know. I try not to lie.
[Marc] Hm.
I've been lying for a long time.
To a lot of people.
And it feels really heavy. [sighs]
Like I'm... swimming with my clothes on
and I can't take them off.
I stopped liking my job,
but I keep working because it pays well.
And that makes me feel sick.
- [Marc] Hmm.
- But not sick enough to quit.
Which makes me feel even more sick.
- You should quit your job.
- Yes.
[laughs]
What are you doing?
- I'm trying to take your clothes off.
- [laughs]
I just told you something truthful.
Now, it's your turn
to tell me something that's not a lie.
I'll try not to judge.
[clicks tongue]
[inhales deeply]
[clicks tongue]
I feel like I abandoned my mom
when I met my husband.
Like I chose a distraction over
sitting alone with her death or something.
Didn't take the time to grieve...
or...
live with the reality that she's gone.
I didn't do that.
I opted out.
Hmm.
Stopped painting. I avoided things
that would remind me of her, even though...
all I want is to be reminded of her.
And I can feel myself
doing the same thing with Oliver.
I agreed to an open marriage...
out of fear, not trust.
He asked,
and the idea of giving him
a reason to leave
felt scarier than keeping him happy,
so that's what I did.
There were rules.
Work trips, one and done.
- "I don't want to hear about it."
- [Theo chuckles]
But he broke those rules.
And I can...
I can feel myself choosing anger...
to distract from...
from how much I miss him.
All I want is to be able
to have that fight with him.
- You should start painting again. I think.
- [laughs]
I've also been told I overstep.
[Marc] Mm.
This is a terrible game.
[both chuckle]
[gentle piano music playing]
- [Marc] It's a shame your city's so ugly.
- [Theo] I know.
- [Marc] Yeah. It's a real problem.
- [Theo] I know. Yeah.
- I should move.
- [Marc chuckles]
[Marc] What are we doing?
- [Theo] Surprise.
- [Marc chuckles]
- [Theo] Just wait.
- [Marc] Okay.
[knocks]
[Theo speaking French]
Merci.
[in English]
Have you ever been here?
[Marc] No, I have not.
I've always wanted to, but...
Merci.
[gentle music continues]
[music swells emotionally]
[Theo] Monet lost two wives and his son,
and was losing his sight
when he painted these.
We are standing in a house of loss.
Wow.
- He wins.
- [laughs]
This is how someone chose to remember
the things he loved.
- It's quite special, no?
- Hmm.
It's amazing.
Imagine being able to do this.
You can do this.
[laughs]
I... No, I can't do this.
No, you can't do this,
because this has already been done.
Pretty successfully.
But you can do something.
You're very nice to me.
It's intentional.
I'm sorry about your husband.
And your mom.
Hello?
[keys jangle]
Hello?
[muffled conversation]
- Where were you?
- [Thomas] Where were you?
[sighs] Relax, would you, Thomas?
[Thomas] Where did you go?
I went for a walk. Why? What's going on?
A long walk.
Yeah, it was a long walk.
What's the problem?
I had to pay for everyone's bill
at karaoke.
Okay, I'll obviously pay you back
for the karaoke bill.
That's not the point.
I mean, it is, and yes, you will.
You said you'd come back.
You didn't come back.
Sophie couldn't talk
by the end of the night.
- [Sophie grunts]
- And?
And while I was paying 1,500 euro
for everyone's bill,
she fucking left, never picked up
her phone again rest of the night.
I told you, I left it at the bar.
Okay, I'm...
I don't get where this is going.
She leaves with a guy none of us know.
You were gone.
Sure, maybe I'd taken a pill,
maybe I was a bit drunk,
but when I don't hear back
from our best friend
after something like that,
I'm gonna get scared.
Okay, okay. Makes sense.
But you could have taken home
that little thing
and had this entire place to yourself.
- Clearly, we were fine.
- Were we?
Soph, do you want to tell him
where you ended up last night?
Hello?
Thomas, I'm sorry, okay?
I appreciate you. Can we just move on?
Soph was picked up by the police.
She was found sleeping near a bus shelter,
half an hour outside the city.
So, while you were napping,
I was with her dealing with that.
Are you okay?
Yes.
I'm here, aren't I?
I honestly don't know when I became
the only friend on this fucking trip.
- [Marc] Okay, okay.
- [Sophie groans] Jesus.
Thomas, I am sorry
that you had to go through that.
Are you still on the drugs?
[chuckles softly]
I'm... I'm just trying...
How is it your husband dying has only
made you even more of a spoiled brat?
[lock rattling]
Hello?
I'm... I'm sorry.
I think I have the wrong apartment.
Then how did your key
let you into this one?
[man] I'm sorry, I didn't think
anyone would be here.
[Thomas] What the fuck is going on?
Who are you?
I'm Luca.
Do you wanna tell them,
or would you like me to?
Oliver met someone else.
- What do you mean?
- That's what this is.
[Sophie] Hold on, hold on.
Oliver gave this kid
the keys to your apartment.
- I didn't know you.
- It's not our apartment.
It's Oliver's apartment.
And yours, presumably?
No.
I only found out about all of this
very recently,
and if I'm being honest,
it was just all too pathetic.
But I needed to see this place
before I gave it up, and I...
I wanted to do something nice
for you both...
It's the lying that's pathetic, Marc.
- Thomas.
- I shouldn't be here.
I'm in the middle of something.
Is there anything you can do on your own?
You have to drag us out here
to, what, keep you company
while you scope out
your husband's double life?
I opened Oliver's Christmas card.
He told me he had met someone else.
I fell apart. I made a bad call.
[Thomas] Hmm.
I do want to spend time with you.
This was never supposed to be...
- It wasn't like that.
- He wrote that in the card to you?
You pretended like you'd been here before.
Thomas, it's like an ache right here.
What is?
Loss.
It's like a little ulcer right here
that never goes away.
And you somehow figure out ways
to take your mind off it enough
to not feel it as much.
But yeah, sometimes you lose sight
of what's going on around you
because you just... [inhales deeply]
You just want to be able
to breathe the way you did before.
So... yeah, I messed up.
And I'm sorry for being a spoiled brat.
I'm just trying to figure out
how to live with the reality
that my husband died...
leaving me...
to get back to this. This.
I'm sorry...
you're having to deal with that,
but I'm allowed to feel things too.
I think you should go.
I don't have anywhere to go tonight.
[Marc sighs]
Can I at least stay here
until I figure out where to go?
- [Marc sighs]
- I can wait in the bathroom.
Oh my God, he's not hiding
in the fucking bathroom.
I'm sorry, don't you live here?
I live in Berlin.
Then how did you meet my husband?
If there is another apartment in Berlin...
I live in Berlin,
but I dance a lot in Paris.
I won Oliver's art scholarship.
[exhales]
[Luca] I was performing in Paris
last year,
and Oliver came backstage after the show
to introduce himself.
Yeah, I'm sure he did.
We kept in touch, and then we just...
- Where are you gonna go?
- He can't stay here.
- He's got nowhere else to go.
- [Marc] I know that.
I am not the bad person in this situation.
And what, is he supposed
to stay here with us?
[melancholy music playing]
[alarm beeping]
Can I help?
No.
Can you not do that inside, please?
Sorry, but the atmosphere in this room
is strangling me.
- [Luca] Can I have a drag?
- Take it.
It's okay?
A cigarette at dinner?
I didn't know I'd woken up in 1988.
[Sophie] Yeah.
I'm sorry, I...
I don't even know what this is.
I'm sorry, everybody. I've messed up.
Should someone say something
before we eat?
Thomas, I really don't think the Lord
should be allowed anywhere near this food.
I think he was talking about Oliver.
Right. Sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
[clears throat]
It's fine.
[Sophie] Marc, fuck.
Can you just let it
not be fine for me, please?
Just let it not be fine.
Let me apologize for fucking up tonight.
Because if I don't, we'll just
move past it like we always do.
Thomas, I'm sorry about last night.
And I'm sorry
for brushing off your feelings.
And I'm really sorry I scared you.
I don't know you,
but I'm sorry you have to listen to this.
Oh, Marc, I'm sorry.
We should be out dancing right now.
That's what he would have wanted.
And I know he did some shady shit to you,
but you have to know that
Oliver loved you so hard.
For so long.
And I'm sorry he's not here anymore.
[cries]
[Sophie] And I miss him.
[sighs] Fuck it.
[melancholy music playing]
He expected more from us.

Terrance got tired of waiting for me
to wake the fuck up.
And I don't blame him.
[sighs] I'm a lot.
All this time,
I thought Terrance was too safe for me.
But he wasn't safe.
He was safety.
And that's the part I wasn't getting.
Because I'm a lot.
I'm a 35-year-old woman
who had a good man who loved her,
and I chose a bus stop.
If it makes you feel better, I don't think
anyone actually has their shit together.
Okay. That's where I disagree.
I think people
can have their shit together
and live lives that aren't a total mess.
And be kind to people,
and be generous to people,
and want good things for people.
So, no, I think that's a cop-out.
It's keeping you both from realizing
your behavior has hurt people.
See, when I asked for the truth...
Okay, is this because
I left early last night?
No, it's a bigger-picture thing.
Well, what is the bigger picture?
It...
What's the bigger picture, Thomas?
There isn't a bigger picture, okay?
Can we get off this thing?
Why is it that you only get this on edge

Why is it only him?
People feel things
that are inconvenient, Thomas.
It happens.
It sucks, but it happens.
That's okay.
It's never me.
And I don't know why.
Not just with you, it's just never me.
I'm never the one.
It's like people can smell it on me.

But it wasn't.
And that's not on you.
It's on us.

I think I just need to go home,

You're right,
people don't have their shit together.
But I think, for our sake...
we have to try harder.

He was curious about everyone.
And everything.
That's why being the one
to hold his curiosity felt so good.
I miss that.
A lot.
[exhales]
- So have you been staying here, or...
- No.
No, he had only just gotten it.
For work, I think.
And it wasn't like that.
I don't blame you
for feeling something for my husband.
It's hard not to.
- A hug might be pushing it, you know.
- [chuckles softly]
Yeah. I understand.
[contemplative music playing]
So, the estate agent called to say
they'd like to list the London house
next week.
Okay.
You're okay with that?
I am, yeah.
That house isn't mine. It was always his.
I feel like you're not into this idea.
My opinion is of little relevance here.
Well, you manage my finances,
I'm selling my house.
Your opinion isn't irrelevant.
I trust you're not running away?
From him, I mean.
Mmm.
My wife died 12 years ago this month.
I ran.
From her.
From us.
Physiology has a clever way
of protecting us
from what we perceive
to be a threat to our bodies.
Which is why
the more we close ourselves off...
the less we feel.
At the time, that benefited me.
I got on with it. Went back to school.
Studied finance.
Built up a successful business.
Nice house.
Good clothes.
Never having desired anyone else.
And you can survive that way.
Until the usualness of it all
starts creeping in.
And the new life you'd built as a refuge...
begins to feel like a void.
Because, as it turns out...
to avoid sadness...
is also to avoid love.
That hindsight is a discomfort that
you will forever mistake for indigestion.
[gentle music playing]
[Sophie] Well, I've been hustling
to get that trust back,
but he's not making it easy.
Is he playing games?
[Sophie] No.
All the feelings are still there.
And he says
he still wants to marry me... eventually.
So, if that's going to happen one day...
he needs to know that I'm good, you know?
- And I get it.
- Hmm.
It's a miracle he's not the worst.
- Oh my God, biblical.
- [exhales]
- Better than it was, huh?
- [Marc] Mm.
Have you talked to Thomas?
[Sophie] I have.
Actually set him up on the apps.
Big step.
Oh, huge.
There's an offer in on the house.
- Oh, fuck you.
- [Marc chuckles]
I will have a guest room ready for you
at the new house.
If you think I'm taking
an hour-long train ride to see you,
you're out of your tiny mind.
I need to be somewhere else.
I want to paint alone in a room
overlooking the ocean
like some sad lesbian in a period drama.
- Oh, Christ, no.
- [Marc laughs]
Please, let me have that.
End of an era, huh?
Huge.
Proud of you.
I'm proud of you.
But I'm serious.
You'll be coming up here
more than I'm going to be going there.
Sober and selfish.
Oh my God, that's the title of my memoir.
I love you.

[song fades out]
It's for you.
- Well, I should hope so.
- [laughs]
He... He was a beauty, wasn't he?
Yeah, it was almost annoying.
He'd have loved this, Marc.
Thank you.
Really.
[gasps]
Get out of town.
Oh, I don't believe it.
Look. Look!
- [Terrance laughs]
- [Sophie gasps]
I love it. You're a genius.
- Aw, I'm glad you like it.
- [Sophie] Oh my God, well done. [gasps]
It's nice to see this thing back on track.
Let me see the ring, let me see the ring.
Things are never on track with this one,
but it's back.
- And it's on.
- [Marc chuckles]
Okay, just because
your face is on this wall
does not mean that you can touch
or take home any of the paintings.
- Moi?
- [Marc] Mmm.
Hands by our sides at all times.
We have some gorgeous sparkling water here
for you tonight.
- Thank you, darling man.
- [Terrance] Very nice.
Really wonderful. Really cool.
[sighs]
I'm glad you came.
Considering how many times
I begged you to start painting again,
you're lucky I didn't come out of spite.
I heard I make a cameo in this show?
Without my written consent?
- Welcoming lawsuits as Christmas presents.
- Hmm.
You're even better than I remember.
It's a step.
I brought my boyfriend.
I hope that's okay.
We went with boyfriend and not partner?
I had my money on partner.
Oh, fuck off.
- [Marc] Who's this?
- Ben.
- Ben, it's very nice to meet you.
- [Ben] It's nice to meet you.
Thank you for coming.
- Just meeting Ben.
- Hi. Yeah.
- Good to see you.
- [Sophie] Hey, pal-so.
[indistinct chatter]
- [all laughing]
- Have you seen the ring?
[Thomas] Oh yeah, I heard all about it.
[Sophie] Do you see me?
[Thomas] Yes, we all see you.
