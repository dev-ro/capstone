If you open the teIephone
directory of Mumbai city then..
..you wiII get 5940369 RahuIs.
But Sonu Nigam, sorry, the..
..the teIephone department
doesn't know that one more..
..RahuI had come to
this city 2 years back.
That same RahuI is shifting to his
won fIat today. - What happened?
He has come down from 1500 sq ft
to the fIoor and do you know why?
Because his friend,
phiIosopher and guide, Karan..
..aIias Pandey.
- Why are you pushing me around?
Show some respect. I know that
your rent for a few months is due.
Both them had met at the
fashion designing institute where..
..both of them had
passed with fIying coIours.
The reason was Karan.
You named your creations
naked truth and sent aII the..
..modeIs on the ramp
wearing onIy their briefs.
Both of you are rusticated
from this coIIege. - Okay.
Madam, pIease. - Madam is the
baIance fees refundabIe? - Get out!
You said that we'II go to a new
house. But this is the oId fIat.
Yes. EarIier we used to go
inside through the front but..
..now we wiII used the back door.
Even after being a taIented
designer RahuI couIdn't cIimb..
..the Iadder of success.
But as far as cIimbing was
concerned Karan was on top of aII.
We have bareIy Ieft and
they have cIoaked everything.
I can't beIieve that we have
come to the same oId house.
And now we don't have
to pay the rent too.
When did we pay it earIier?
Both of them are very Iucky as
far as getting a job is concerned.
If the young boys get the job of
dressing up young girIs then..
..who wiII bother
about the size of the pay?
Any way their Iife is not run on
cash but not even credit cards.
It runs on credit. EarIier I
had doubt seeing your faces.
But I'm giving it now seeing
this chap's face. Both the suit.
What? - It is suit. I aIso
thought something eIse earIier.
Yes, we'II return your suit.
- That's what I said.
Don't ask me where these two
are of to wearing the suit.
They are of to an important
mission. - Hey, wiII you drive?
I'm hungry, buddy. Today
there is no marriage or baptism..
Nobody is ceIebrating a
death anniversary or birthday.
What shaII we do
for our food, buddy?
You aIways think of onIy food.
Think what we'II do for our drinks.
You don't taIk about drinking. I
need it compuIsoriIy after drinks.
Yes, buddy. I aIso need it.
- I'm taIking about sIeep.
I'm aIso taIking
about sIeeping onIy.
Their soIution is a schooI party.
Such a schooI where both of
them have never been and..
..such a party where
they have not been invited.
That's how it is.
- Park it properIy. - What?
Get the air checked aIso.
Kabab.
That is why I don't take
him to Taj and Oberoi.
You keep going. I'II be back soon.
- Okay.
What's for dinner?
- Quite a Iot.
Come here every 5 minutes.
What's your name?
- Guddu.
You don't meet me these days.
- You aIso don't meet me.
Hi, how are you?
- Fine, how about you.
Guddu, do you remember that she
was Iike a carom board in the schooI?
Now it has become Iike a mountain.
How did this happen? - For 2 years
she is working in the siIicon vaIIey.
AnjaIi, did you hear that
Sanju might be coming tonight.
That too from America.
What? Sanju ! The one who was
everyone's heart throb in schooI?
I hope you are not
puIIing a fast one. - No.
It is a Iong time
since I've seen him.
He is in America for
the Iast 12 years.
A boy from America. Must
be an accompIished pIay boy.
Come here.
When Sanju comes we must take a

Because our SyIvina has
become Miss America. - Oh reaIIy.
Then we must ask

Friend, just one more.
Come on, buddy.
Come on, pIease don't.
Kabab.
DarIing!

Excuse me, have you seen my Naina.

Wow!

Ladies and gentIemen. Listen

You again got us into
a probIem. Sanju, shit!
How wiII I know that Sanju
is a girI and not a boy?
Our Iife is aIso a heII.
We eat Iunch on credit..
..and pay for the
punches that we get.
How many times have I
toId you not to pIay bIind?
This much my father
aIso didn't insuIt me..
..when he threw me out of the house.
Don't remind me of my father,
buddy. When I Ieft DeIhi he..
..came to the station to see me off.
He had tears in his eyes when he
said that.. - What did he say?
He said that promise me that
you'II never return back home.
See there is a bird there.
- In the night? It must be a bat.
Not the fIying one, buddy.
The one that makes us fIy.
See there.
- Oh !
She is not in our IeveI, buddy.
Her father must be a miIIionaire.
After marriage we
reduce the miIIions.
This had to go bad now.
- Mercedes doesn't have its..
..earIier reputation. - Yes,
buddy - Why don't you buy a Ferrari?
I was going to buy that but there
was onIy one piece in the showroom.
Sachin was adamant in buying that.
- You mean TenduIkar. - Yes.
I Ieft that car for the sake
of the nation and he is crying..
..for such a smaII thing.
- Yes, buddy. So sad.
Oh Mercedes. Mine is aIso
a Mercedes. Any probIem?
Look at this. The
door is not opening.
Opening things is my speciaIty.
Come on, give me the kiss.
I mean give me the keys.
Here you are.
Your fingers seem to
have magic in them.
AII my eIeven
fingers have magic in them.
Then show me that magic.
- No, not here.
Let us go to a pIace where
both of us are aII aIone.
Sure! Then Iet's go.
- Come on.
Let's go.
- Where shaII I Ieave the Mercedes?
Leave it at Krishna cottage.
- Okay.
Can I ask you something?
- Yes.
Don't you have any boyfriends?
I mean..
ActuaIIy I Iike the height of
the MusIim boys and the width..
..of the Gujarati boys. It is
not onIy difficuIt to get such a..
..combination but it is
aIso impossibIe to find one.
You didn't teII me your name.
- Nasiruddin Shah.
So you work in the movies.
- No, I'm not that one.
God is great! His fortune
aIways takes him forward and..
..my fortune makes me
cIimb from the back.
Sir, the
commissioner has caIIed for you.
Sir.
I had caIIed for the HavaIdar,
why have you come?
I'm HavaIdar sir.
Then why are you wearing
the uniform of an inspector?
Sir I'm an inspector. - You're an
HavaIdar (constabIe) & an inspector.
Two positions at the same time.
Sir, my name is HavaIdar and
I'm an inspector in the force.
I'm inspector HavaIdar.
- Shut up.
Your case is more
compIicated than this case.
This is the fifth case
in the Iast 2 months.
Sir, a girI has been raped
and murdered in the Iift.
What is the poIice
doing in this connection?
What are you doing?
- I'm shaking it up. - What?
I mean that I've
shaken up the poIice force.
If the poIice can't soIve this
case then we'II take the heIp..
..of an expert.
- Expert! What type of an expert?
A person with the experience
of rape and murder. - What?
I mean a person who has
soIved such cases before.
What can be the motive
behind such murders, sir?
Time pass.
- What, time pass?
When there is rape the
motive is cIear. Sex.
Sex can be bought with money too.
Every one is not as
fortunate as you are, madam.
How are you sure that aII
these murders have been..
..committed by the same person?
That is because this time aIso
there is a red rose near the..
..dead body and a part from the
body is aIso missing as earIier.
This time which
part is missing, sir?
That is.. Sorry, I can't teII in
front of a famiIy audience.
In your opinion who couId it be
who is committing aII these murders?
To Iook at he wiII an
ordinary man you and me but behind..
..that mask of an innocent man is
the face of murderous, inhuman deviI.
I'm sorry Mrs. Gaitonde.
I'm in a heIpIess situation.
I don't know what you are
but you are Iike a cow to me.
Good morning uncIe.
WiII you teII about this to
anybody? - Have we toId tiII today.
No, thank you.
What's this? Stop it.
The day I catch you that
doII of yours wiII be finished.
The suit taken on
hire has been damaged.
That stammering feIIow Popat
of the Iaundry wiII kiII me.
Sir, someone has
unnecessariIy instigated you.
There is no ghost in this house.
I need money badIy, so I'm
seIIing this house cheap.
The IandIord. I think
that we must vanish now.
Come. This is the fIat with 24
hours water and 24 hours eIectricity.
You'II aIso get fresh air
and a good view for free.
Now you bring your wife
and start Iiving here.
Why can't I Iive with another
woman? - Of course, why not?
One minute.
- Okay. One minute.
HeIIo darIing, I had come on a
work hence couIdn't ring you up.
Who are you?
I don't have a name.
- Why?
Since my rebirth
hasn't happened yet.
I'm Iooking for a body.
Were you Iooking for me?
- Yes.
I can go anywhere.
Inside your phone too.
Why my phone?
- Isn't incoming free? - Yes.
Where is he?
- You have to Iend me your body.
'Praise the Iord. Lord
save me from the miseries.'
'The Iord who shaII keep
ghosts away from you.'
The ghost is
itseIf chanting prayers.
Ghost!
How many
misunderstandings do human have?
How many times
have I toId you that..
..they don't stay here
anymore? Go from here.
Why don't you
understand what I'm teIIing you?
They have given me this
address and toId me to come..
..here and take the suit from them.
- Shut up.
I have given it on hire them.
I have a Iaundry.
You are taIking
obscene you dirty man.
I'II not Ieave you. I have
suppIies suits to a Iot of big men.
Get Iost.
Ghost!
What is this happening.
Someone is shouting ghost..
..and someone is
shouting for his suit here.
How hard that fatso
hit me on my heart.
In the backside there is Popat and
in the front it is the Iand Iord.
How do I go out from here?
This is seventh customer
that I brought and he ran away..
..as if he saw a ghost.
- Ghost!
What is wrong? Why
did you get startIed?
Have you aIso seen the ghost?
- Yes, sir. - Where?
On the CD. - On the buiIding
stairs? - No, on a pirated CD.
I'm not taIking of that movie.
I'm taIking of reaI ghosts.
Are that chaps Karan and
RahuI coming here steaIthiIy?
What are you saying sir?
Some one 5 foot and 10 inches..
..taII wiII go through this
pIace without me noticing.
No one can escape from my eyes.
HeIIo. Are you Iike
this from chiIdhood?
Have a nice day. Bye.
- Bye.
Go carefuIIy.
How unkind god is? He wiII have to
remain aIone throughout his Iife.
No, darIing. God makes
a pair for everyone.
See he has made you
to be paired with me.
That's why I say that god
is so unfair. - Come home.
Hey Auto. Come here.
You can run away from this worId.
How Iong wiII you run
away from your seIf?
PIease Iook at my paIms
and teII me about my fortune.
I don't have to see your hands.
I can see your face and teII.
The Saturn is annoyed with you.
Sunny DeoI. I mean Iord Shani.
Give me one thousand rupees.
I'II go out and perform prayers.
I don't have 1000 rupees.
- Then 800. - I don't have that too.
500.
- No. - 200 - No.
At Ieast you must have 100.
- No.
Then how much do you have?
AII put together I have
tweIve and haIf rupees.
Then you don't have to
fear for anything, son.
Even the Saturn can't
do any damage to you.
Go. Vacate the pIace.
It seems that he
has become emotionaI.
Listen. You seem
to be a good person.
Come here and Iisten to me.
- TeII me.
A girI wiII come into your Iife.
GirI! - Yes, she won't be an
ordinary girI. She'II have a..
..moIe on her chest.
- MoIe on her chest! - Yes.
Once that girI comes
your fortunes wiII change.
Fame wiII faII at your feet. The
worId wiII be behind you and..
..you shaII be ahead of the worId.
Where wiII I get such a girI? -
You get the god if you seek for him.
Go and seek.
What are you staring at?
ShaII I give you some thrashing?
Karan, what happened?
- This? That girI with whom..
..I went Iast night on
the Mercedes. - Accident!
Did it hurt badIy?
- No, you have to grow up.
You don't know, some
women Iike it wiId.
WiId!
- That too in a 5 star hoteI.
Then she gave everything over to me.
He said that he is Nasaruddin Shah
and forced me to sit in the car.
I didn't know that
the car was stoIen.
I promise you that I didn't
steaI the car. I have done nothing.
I just opened.
- What? - Door.
Now I'II give you a thrashing,
get inside.
Then we went inside
her room. A deIuxe suite.
Then she sIowIy started undressing.
Lucky man. After that?
- After that she tied my hands.
Sir, don't dare to touch me.
Why not? Your fingers
have magic, isn't it?
They don't have now they had it.
- Shut up.
Why are you siIent?
TeII me after that.
Then she took out my beIt.
WiII you open it again? Nothing
of yours wiII open after that.
How Iong did it carry on?
- For the first ten minutes I was..
..conscious and
thereafter I don't know.
When I gained
consciousness it was aII over.
Then how did you come here?
She dropped me in her Mercedes.
It was one wiId night, isn't it?
- Yes, buddy.
The girIs Iike it
that way these days.
The night is over and
everything is forgotten.
But she wiII not be Iike that.
She! Who's that?
The one who'II change my fortune.
- Who wiII change your fortune?
That girI who wiII
have a moIe in her chest.
Yes, buddy. One astroIoger
toId me today that one girI..
.,Iike that wiII come into my
Iife and change my fortunes.
You do as I suggest. You find a
girI first. Then you put a moIe..
..on her chest. Because if you

..get beaten and aIso get me beaten.
I have fuII faith that the girI..

Moreover you have a Iarge heart.
Why did you stop? Keep massaging me.
The girI with the moIe?
My sister in Iaw.
There?
- Yes, buddy.
Is there a moIe in her chest?
- You don't beIieve me.
No Iike that, buddy.
- Now go and propose to her.
The marriage wiII be in the
night and the honeymoon in DK's fIat.
Is that the keys to DK's fIat?
Yes, now we wiII enjoy
one fuII month there.
It's not nice to go to 5 star
hoteIs using a girI's money.
Now go.
- Yes.
But what wiII I do, buddy?
It's simpIe. Take a rose
and smiIe at the girI.
But a IittIe Iess.
If in response the girI
smiIes then wink at her.
OnIy one eye.
Yes.
If she gets up and waIks away
then it means she is caIIing you.
Go and propose to her.
It's working.
She Iooks a IittIe outdated.
But I've got to do this
to update my fortunes.
She is caIIing you.
She is hooked. She
has caIIed me aIone.
Let me go and check up the moIe.
Excuse me. - Hey, take away
your hands. - Listen to me.
The moIe.
- PoIice! HeIp!
HeIp!
Madam, what happened?
Why were you shouting?
TeII us what the matter is.
A young man came
with a red rose and..
Look that side. You
pIease Iook that side.
He put his hand.. Have
you understood? - Yes.
I hope it was not
that seriaI kiIIer.
The one who rapes the
girIs and kiIIs them.
SeriaI kiIIer!
I'm a fooI. Whom did
I take advice from?
I escaped by a hairIine.
I don't know what that woman
must be thinking about me?
You. - I just wanted to see wheth
er you have it or not.
That's why I.. - Not here.
Go there. PIease go away.
Madam, stop. ControI. I'm not abIe
to controI myseIf, madam.
PIease heIp me, madam.
- HeIp.
I'm unabIe to controI,
madam. HeIp me. - HeIp.
ControI me, madam. Madam!
Madam, my pants.
Madam, pIease forgive me.
I'm not abIe to controI.
Madam, heIp me. Madam, controI.
Yes, we shaII do it.
That's what we are here for.
A big nuisance.
- What happened?
Here we are not getting the rapist.
There is this suppIier..
..caIIed Popat who is
teIephoning big shots and..
..teIIIing them that he
wiII suppIy girIs to them.
Hey, go and enquire.
- Yes, sir.
Inspector, I shouIdn't
have Ieft my husband.
I was rocking. - This is not a
Chinese van. It's a poIice station.
That's why I have come
here to give a compIaint.
CompIaint? PIease teII me.
Someone tried to rape me.
Rape you?
- Yes.
Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure, idiot.
Are you sure that
this is the same person.
Yes, sir. The woman says that he
aIso had a red rose which..
..we find near every corpse.
He aIso had a machine to cut..
..parts from the body.
I'm sure sir that he
is the same kiIIer.
Once we get his description
the photo wouId be reIeased..
..and that person
wouId be behind bars.
Look inspector.
I don't want to take
any chance in this case.
Hence as I had said I'm appointing
an expert to soIve this case.
Expert!
- Yes, Dr. SrewaIa.
Dr. SrewaIa is a practicing doctor.
But he is a master in
criminaI psychoIogy.
I know him from the time he used..
..to teach psychoIogy
in DeIhi University.
He has major contributions in
catching big seriaI kiIIers.
He has recentIy returned
after assisting ScotIand yard.
He wiII assist us in this
case on our personaI request.
Let him work on this
case in his own styIe.
Because he has his own
theory in soIving such cases.
Three, two and one.
Dr. SrewaIa, have you
forgotten something?
Yes, purse.
Not the purse but you've
forgotten to wear your trousers.
Where is the purse?
- Inside your trousers.
So you see Iogic.
The trousers wiII aIso
come aIong with the purse.
You see, what I practice at
home, that psychoIogicaI..
..theory I practice
on my patients aIso.
Don't practice this
theory and forget me one day.
How can I forget you? Mrs..
Parvati.
- Who is that?
Joking! Mrs. SrewaIa.
Listen. Don't take
up any dangerous case.
You remember that you
narrowIy escaped death..
..at the raiIway yard in
ScotIand yard and took..
..a vow that you'II never
take up any case henceforth.
You had promised that
you'II onIy practise.
I wiII stick to it.
- Promise. - Promise.
Take this.
- One sec. HeIIo.
Yes. I'm reaching in
another 5 minutes. Yes, I wiII.
It's more..
..more smaII.. and scary.
And hair.. just Iike yours.
Straightened up.
The nose was not Iike this.
WeIcome sir. I'm
Inspector HawaIadar.
ActuaIIy, sir, I.. - You're
Inspector but your name is HawaIdar.
Oh ! The Commissioner was right.
You're reaIIy speciaI, sir.
Are you searching for something?
- BaIIs.
BaIIs? - Yes, found 2 but
stiII Iooking for the third one.
Three? You're extra-speciaI, sir!
MyseIf Hiya Hingorani
from Honk Kong. Yes, sir?
Miss Hingorani.. choose baII.
- Why, sir?
This is Dr. ScrewwaIa. The
famous criminaI psychoIogist.
Do as he says.
- Oh !
Right.
- Right?
My doubt has proved right.
She is a victim.
You're reaIIy speciaI, sir.
But, how did you come to know
with the baII that she's a victim?
Inspector, HawaIdar..
- Yes?
Haven't you read my thesis?
The theory of my three baIIs?
Read them. And you'II
understand everything.
Now give me the case detaiIs.
The first murder was at
KaIyan, then KandivaIi..
..then Kanjurmarg, then
KurIa, then KaIbadevi..
..then the Iast attempted
murder at Khar.. is that right?
Yes, sir.
- What do you think, inspector?
Every word starts
from the Ietter 'K.'
This man Iikes the word 'K.'
Sir! I've got it!
- Oh, reaIIy?
'Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham.'
'Kuch Kuch Hota
Hai.' 'KaI Ho Na Ho.'
Sir, there's a new
suspect in my eyes.
'Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki.'
'Kasauti Zindagi Ki.'
I've got another suspect in my eyes.
And if we work
shouIder to shouIder..
..then we'II certainIy succeed, sir.
He's the one!
- Oh !
The ruffian !
- The ruffian ! - Got him!
Sir, we've got him!
This very face has snatched
away the peace in my Iife!
I won't spare him! I'II
reIease his photo in the press!
You'II not at aII do that.
- Huh !
If you arrest him on the
statement of a woman..
..then any abIe
Iawyer wiII get him out.
And I reaIIy don't want that!
- Then what do you want?
I want to catch him red handed!
I want to catch him red handed!
From today on operation
'FaiI' starts. - Operation 'FaiI!'
But, why operation 'FaiI', sir?
Inspector, you shaII
get to know about that..
..after the success of
the operation. - Huh !
Oh ! Oh, sir!
On one hand it's the Pandit..
and on the other it's you !
Both are speciaI!
His address.. his food.. his
drink.. his usuaI hanging pIaces..
..and the pIace where he sIeeps..
and with whom does he sIeep..
..everything.. everything
about this guy. - Yes, sir!
Oh, yeah !
Oh, yeah !
Oh, yeah !
Oh, yeah !
Do you know..
..just for these fiIms..
..Japan has made such a TV..
..that you can go into
it from the backside.
What are you taIking about?
But, where's the way to come out?
When there's so much fun inside..
..then why wouId anybody
want to come out? - Yeah.
ActuaIIy, they were aIso
trying to stop me inside..
..but I had to come
out with a heavy heart.
Just for you.
- Thanks.
It seems they are caIIing
you again. - It's the phone.
HeIIo.
- Hi, Love.
Oh, God!
- PIease, don't put the phone down.
PIease come to me.
Look.. nobody shouId know
that we're Iiving in DK's house.
Yes, we don't stay here.
Look, DK, you cannot fooI
me by changing your voice.
I know that you're at home.
Why are you doing this
to me? What's my fauIt?
Nothing.
- Let go!
Nobody shouId know.. that's why.
HeIIo.. heIIo!
O my God!.
Dk.. you've not done the right
thing by being unfaithfuI to me.
You've seen the Iove of Kiran..
and not her retribution.
By the way.. whoever the girI was..
..she seemed to be
quite perturbed with DK.
Hey.. was it that Kiran?!
The one who was fighting
with him at the store?!
Be it Kiran or Raj Kiran..
..don't put ourseIves in another
mess by meddIing into DK's affairs!
Not again.
I was simpIy giving her a
shouIder, man. - ShouIder?!
If you give her a shouIder..
..then DK's gonna Iend a
shouIder to you (dead body)!
And, he won't be aIone.. there wi
II three men aIong with him.
And, you.. what wiII you do?
- Me?
I'II waIk ahead
with a pot in my hand.
Just stop giving me Iectures.
Think about your own Iove
Iife. Think about marriage.
That oiIy oId girI of yours..
she's getting further oId.
Don't remind me of that!
- Let me eat. - Here.
Just don't know where the girI
might be.. who's my destiny!
Madam.. we've brought him.
Catch.
Men ! They are aII use for nothing!
So, girI.. was he the same?
TeII me, girI.
- Yes, sis, he's the one.
When I was passing
through the Ianes..
..he pinched me on the butt and
caIIed me 'Kimi Katkar (Actress).
Is it? You move. Move.
- Madam.. Madam..
Madam.. the thing is.. she's
into the habit of sIeep waIking..
..so I was trying to
wake her up by pinching.
Waking up?
- Yeah.
And if I raise my baton..
neither you'II be abIe to wake up..
..nor wiII you be abIe
to Iift anything! RascaI?!
Pinching?!
What's happening inside?
- Whatever's happening inside..
..can happen with you as weII.
- Huh !
Don't worry, Raghu.
You've just pick-pocketed,
isn't it? - Hmm.
But this inspector UrmiIa
Martodkar is a danger woman..
..she'II forgive you
for 100 kiIIings..
..but she won't ever spare
you for harassing a girI.
It's the madam's caII.
HeIIo? The madam's busy.
What?
Madam, your caII.
- Who is it?
Some Kiran..
- What?
She's caIIing herseIf
Kiran. I refused her..
..but she says
it's an pretty urgent.
Madam, the rod had been heated.
You Iike to pinch in
the butt, isn't it?
It's Sub-inspector
UrmiIa Martodkar.. who's that?
I'm Kiran.
What do you want?
Inspector Martodkar,
I've heard that..
..you go out of the way
to heIp peopIe Iike me..
..who have been betrayed in Iove?
- That's 100% right.
Seems you've aIso been betrayed?
- Sir.
TeII me the name of that
scum and I'II take care of him.
DK.. his name is name is DK.
We were into an affair
since past two years.
But when I spoke about marriage..
he simpIy refused.
He isn't picking up the phone even.
- Better go to his home.
I had to.. but the thing is.. my
parents are against this marriage.
They have boIted me
shut in the house.
And if DK doesn't stands by me..
then I'II commit suicide.
No, dear.. you
shouIdn't taIk Iike that.
Your DK needs a proper briefing.
Hmm. Madam..
- Yeah?
The rod is stiII in.
- PuII it out. - Okay.
And Iisten.. shove two more.
Yes, teII me his number and address.
Hey!
I've kept the press on Popat's suit!
Just keep an eye on it!
- Oh, shit!
I hope it's Kiran.
HeIIo.
- Can I speak to D.K, pIease?
He is.. but who are you?
- My name is Kareena.
I've heard a Iot about him. But
never got a chance to meet him.
Can you pIease give the
phone to him? - ActuaIIy..
ActuaIIy, I'm DK here.
- DK!?
Oh, wow!
I'm a great fan of your designs.
- Me too.
ActuaIIy, sir.. I'm supposed to
take part in 'Miss Bhandup' contest.
I want you to design
my cIothes. WiII you do?
Yes, of course. In
fact I was born to do.
But, what's the need for cIothes
to win the competition? - I know.
But it's written on the form
that cIothes are compuIsory.
Yeah, these days
they are very strict.
Fine. I'II come right away
to give you my measurement.
In the pretext we
shaII meet each other.
I cannot wait for that.
Come soon and give it to me..
I'II be waiting for you.
Okay, then..
- Bye. - Soon.
Am I cooI or am I cooI?
So, you've become D.K.?
- Yeah. You know how is it?
But, who is this DK?
- He's a dog.
He fooIed a girI and
is then betraying her.
But I wiII see to it now.. as to
how doesn't he mends his ways.
Look.. Iisten to me..
..what if the girI
comes to know the reaIity?
How wiII she, man?
She hasn't yet seen DK.
Now I'm DK for her.
Try understanding man.
The air is hot..
That's why I'm teIIing you.. pIay
cautiousIy.. or eIse you'II burn.
Didn't I teII you to keep an eye?!
- Sorry!
Now you've to handIe
this thing and Popat!
Bye-bye to both DK and you !
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Where's he? Disappeared!
The rascaIs.. gave me
aII the wrong numbers..
..and got me
thrashed from the pubIic!
I won't spare him!
I won't spare him!
Excuse me..
- Huh?
Your keys.
'A girI shaII come in your Iife..
who might have a moIe on her heart.'
What you doing?
'CooI-CooI!'
'CooI-CooI!'
'CooI-CooI!'
Seems to Iess?
I've to manage.
Go.. and caII the sir.
- Okay.
I'm the sir.
So, you're DK?
- Any doubt?
Kareena?
Shahid.. I mean.. I mean DK.
Come. PIease come in.
Don't be scared. Don't
be scared. I'm there baby.
Don't be scared.
Bye.
This means.. the moment
our Iady officer Iures him..
We'II catch him red handed.
The pIan is good.
But why is it that you need an
officer of 20-30 for this operation?
Good question, Mr. Commissioner?
But, you've to understand that..
..I'II have to create
some situations for him..
..so that he wiII be in a
position to attempt rape.
And this particuIar
emotion wiII arise..
..onIy when the girI
is between 20 and 30..
..and she shouId be
beautifuI and absoIuteIy charming..
..and.. sexy!
But, such an
emotion can arise even..
..at the sight of an
eIderIy woman, Dr. ScrewwaIa.
I'm not taIking about you.
I'm taIking about that kiIIer.
Sir!
- Yes?
Sir.. as you toId..
..I've carefuIIy seIected four
Iady officers from the department.
Good. Are they aII between
20 and 30? - They seem to be.
Come, sir. Sir, this is
Inspector PhuIe. - PhuIe?
This is Inspector Masoom Kumari.
HeIIo.
- Come.
This is Inspector Roopmati.
- Who?
Roopmati.
- HeIIo. - Come.
This is Inspector Kamsin Gupta.
Are they aII in the
poIice department? - Yes.
You can go.
Nobody eIse?
- EIse?
Yeah. She might be on the way.
But, she's very hot-headed.
She's caIIed 'Ab Tak Chappan'
(56 as yet) in the department.
57!
Your DK is number 57
whom I've straightened out.
He might pick up
anything eIse or not..
..but he'II
certainIy pick up your phone.
Get away!
Who is she?
Sir, she's UrmiIa Martodkar.
- UrmiIa Martodkar..
Is she okay?
- She needs some repairing but..
Where's he?
Is she okay?
- Yes.
Mr. Commissioner.. if
I wear short dresses..
..and if I teII him 'WeIcome'..
then Iet aIone that rapist..
..not any common man wiII Ieave me.
Isn't it, Dr.
ScrewwaIa? Isn't it normaI?
Do you find this man as normaI?!
Lights off!
Look.. he's reminded of something
the moment he sees the watch.
And he risks his Iife.. to
reach somewhere on time.
But, where?
That's the repIy to it.
He knows that a girI arrives in
the baIcony daiIy at this time.
He has his timing
for this perversion.
Look.. Iook.. is this normaI?
Motherf..
- Look ahead.
Any man can get excited at this
sight of this girI in this pose..
..but except for the Commissioner.
- Right, sir.
This man's mind has crossed
aII the Iimits to vuIgarities.
Look what aII he does when he's
unabIe to controI his Iust. - Motherf..
And he tries to
head toward the girI..
..but she's fortunate
enough to move out from there..
..but then see what he does
to overcome his Iust. Look.
When he can do aII
this in broad dayIight..
..imagine what might
he not do during night.
No, his game is not up yet.
Now, here you might feeI
that he's pIaying with the cat.
But, no.. his game is
something different.
This is normaI, Mrs. Martodkar?
The bIoody!
You gun seems to be
firing daiIy, man?
It was that Mercedes
babe the other day..
..and today this one..
whom did you enjoyed the most?
With this one?
Want to hear the detaiIs?
- Of course, man !
TeII me.
- She came into the bedroom.
WeIcome to my bed.
How is it?
Great.
- Great, isn't it? I knew it.
In the bedroom?
Then?
- Then she heId my hand in hers.
At her touch.. my whoIe
worId started spinning. - Aaah !
What happened then?
Taange (Legs)! - So you went
in a Tanga (Horse carriage)?
Not the Tanga (Horse carriage)..
her Iegs..
..they were so beautifuI..
I grabbed them tight!
Then? - Then she brought her siIky
tresses near my face..
..and then she
spread them on my face..
I'm teIIing you the truth !
I'm not DK! - FooIing
Inspector UrmiIa Martodkar?!
AsshoIe!
Wow! What happened next?
Then she took me into the bathroom..
..and in the bath-tub.. we three..
- Three?
Me.. her..
- The pIumber?
Water.
- Oh, yeah water.
Water.
- What happened next?
We were Iying in the water..
..and a current was
passing through my body!
The phone's ringing!
- Huh? - The phone.
HeIIo. - DK dear, pIease
don't put the phone down.
Yes, Miss Kiran, I'II
do whatever you say..
..but the truth is.. I'm not DK.
What? You're not DK?
- Yeah.
Then where's DK?
- DK.. that dog.. that swine..
..he betrayed you and
took off to America.
DK betrayed me and went to America?
- Yeah.
Did he forgot aII the nights that he
spent with me at the Juhu BungaIow?
Juhu's BungaIow!
The promises he made in
the backseat of my Mercedes!
Mercedes!
- He forgot everything?
Miss Kiran.. if I..
..had I been in DK's pIace then
I wouIdn't have made you weep.
I wouId have never Ieft you ever.
- ReaIIy?
I wish there was someone
Iike me in your Iife. I wish..
But.. have you ever seen me?
''As I saw you.''
''As I got to know you.''
''I Iost aII my senses.''
Ever since I saw you, Kiran..
I'm unabIe to see anything eIse.
That means you reaIIy Iove me?
You're not after my money?
No, not at aII.
I'm just after you, Kiran.
How romantic! Stay ever behind me.
And, you stay ever in front of me.
- How sweet!
I Iove you, Kiran.
- I Iove you, Iove.
My Iove, I Iove you.
I Iove you. I Iove you.
HeIp me, man. - From today on
I've stopped doing Iabour work.
Meaning? - You used to say
not to pIay in bIind, isn't it?
Today I pIayed it bIind..
and I won the jackpot..
..the car, the bungaIow..
and Kiran.. everything!
How come?
- I've set Kiran.
Boss's Kiran?
- She was Boss's.. now she's mine.
Tomorrow she might
be someone eIse's.
Such girIs are untrustworthy.
They forget everything
aIong with the passing night.
You better move. Go
and do the Iabour work.
Don't teII me Iater..
that I didn't teII you.
Don't teII me Iater!
Aaah ! Hey!
Move in ! Move in !
What's this, man? Where's it stuck?
Come out!
It's stuck in the wrong pIace, man !
What's this? Out! Out!
It wiII get torn !
I'II shoot the bastard right here!
Miss Martodkar do you want to faiI..
..the operation 'FaiI'
right on the first day?
We've to catch him red handed.
And not bare-handed.
But, Iook, what is he up to?!
Listen.. according to my pIan..
first you go to his house.
Okay? Let's go.
We've to change your appearance.
Look..
..at first Bihar has to
be turned into Mumbai..
..and then in Mumbai..
NaIasopara and Bhayander..
..have to be turned
into MaIabar hiII.
It's difficuIt. But try it out.
''We're so cooI!''
''We're so cooI!''
- Get Iost you asshoIe!
I'm sorry, madam. I
didn't recognise you.
ShouId I shove in the rod?!
- Rod?! - HoId it. HoId it.
He didn't recognise
means its working..
..but one thing has to
be changed.. your Iingo.
Once I get a new job..
I'II get rid of this DK.
Oh God! The IandIord!
When wiII I get rid of him?!
God wiIIing.. it
shouId get soId today.
Come, madam. Here's the fIat.
Come, madam. I'II
show you the whoIe fIat.
I want to see it aIone.
- Want to see it aIone? Why?
I want to stay in here aIone.
- Oh, I see.
Fine. You see it. I'II be
back from the society's office.
'A girI shaII come in your Iife..
who might have a dot on her heart.'
Madam, did you see the house?!
- Yes, here..
Don't teII him that
I'm here.. cut off!
So, sister, are you
purchasing this fIat?
No, I don't want to purchase it.
Rather I want it on rent.
No, sister, I've repented a Iot
since I gave it on rent once..
..hence I don't want to
give it again on rent.
So what shouId I do?
I'II make a move.
Seems Iike the house is jinxed.
It isn't getting soId off.
HeIIo. - ScrewwaIa's in
there? - Why you?. - Hey!
UrmiIa Martod.
- UrmiIa Martod!
He's bathing.
HeIIo.
Just excuse me pIease, one second.
Go out for a whiIe.
Thank you very much.
Sorry to keep you hoIding but..
..I hope you didn't teII Mrs.
ScrewwaIa about your identity?
No.
- Good.
She might not be abIe to bear it if
she comes to know aII of a sudden.
HoId on, pIease.
Stop suspecting!
Have you been to his house?
- Yes, I've.
He has got a fiIthy
sight! The bIoody..
Language, Miss Martodkar.
Be carefuI of your Ianguage.
Yeah.
- What happened next?
What eIse.. I said I don't want
to purchase it.. give it on rent.
Good, good. Did he hear
you say that? - Yes, he did.
Now, do as he says. Don't argue.
He'II definiteIy come after you.
Aaah !
Come here.
Come here!
Come!
Look.. I've heard
you taIking to him.
You want this fIat on
rent, isn't it? - Hmm.
You'II get it. ActuaIIy you
don't have to given the rent even.
You can stay with me.
The way you I stay.
But.. are you okay in mounting?
- What did you say?!
Nobody shouId know about it..
..so the mounting
shouId be done from behind.
By the way.. today's it's the day
off.. nobody wiII come over there.
Don't be scared.
Just come to stay over there.
- When?
Tonight at 2 A.M.
Okay?
- Hmm.
Hey! One minute! One minute!
What's your name?
- UrmiIa.
RahuI. Nice to meet you.
PIease do come. 2 at night.
Ouch !

To cIimb up without practice?
It might a bit difficuIt.
But are you caIIing from a PCO?
- Yes, sir, I'm caIIing from a PCO.
Good. Because I don't want my wife

You never toId me that

They have Iocked her in a room!
I don't think I'II be

I mean.. without her money.
I've aIready settIed down

Then what are you pIanning to do?
Today I'm going to her house..

TeII me.. is it easy find

Everyone shaII go head over heeIs!
They wiII freeze at my sight!
Munna, your father had buiIt this
White House with aII his bIack money.
Yes, he did.. but we've to
seII it because of Kiran.
Is that man coming to see the house?
No, his son is coming.
ActuaIIy the boy is

..and he'II be staying

Oh my!
The height of this bungaIow is

He Ioves me! He Ioves me not!

He Ioves me not!
You're reaI crazy.
- Yes, crazy in Iove!

Wow!

''CooI!''
''Look, we're so cooI!''
Who's that man-woman besides Kiran !?
He's the same one..

Don't worry,

After you depart.. I'II properIy

Why not? Why not? It's
necessary to suppIication.
So, shouId we take it as finaI?
FinaI?
To teII the truth.. I
thought you might object to it.
Why is that so?
- I mean.. it happens..
..to hand over your
priced treasure to a stranger.
How it is.. I know.
But.. you guys are a
great famiIy. Great famiIy!
By the way..

Both are ready.
What's this, uncIe?
You've Iocked in Kiran?!
One minute.. who are you?
Who am I? Jokes yet again?
I'm your wouId-be son in Iaw.
And, Kiran's wouId be husband.
- Huh !
By the way.. is there any
affair between these two? - Shut up!
He's the one who has provoked Kiran !
UncIe, why have you
turned into a viIIain..
..from a supporting actor
aII of a sudden? - Shut up!
He's wants to gain
from her naOve nature!
Get Iost from here!
- Look, uncIe..
.. I've come here to
taIk about marriage.
TaIk with some respect.
Be shamefuI, you scoundreI!
What shame? I've just come
here to seek Kiran's hand!
You're taIking as if
I've made Kiran pregnant!
O' God!
How shaII we face the peopIe?!
- Shanti! Shanti, Iisten to me!
I'm trying to teII the
same thing to Shanti.
Get Iost from here.

Get Iost, scum! Or eIse

And if you cut the back then..

Take it easy! Take it easy!
Don't take tension

Hey, uncIe.. remember

Attack!
O' God!
Now, teII me.. what's your probIem?
ActuaIIy, doctor.. the
probIem is.. I Iove men.
I just Iove boys.
Look.. this is not hereditary.
- It is, doctor.
The thing is.. even
my father Iikes boys.
My grandfather Iiked boys.
Moreover even my great
grandfather Iiked boys.
Look, Iook, Iook.. is
there nobody in your house..
..who Iikes girIs as weII?
Yes, it is.
- Very good.
Who's it?
- My sister.
One minute.
Dr. Rekha, here. - Rekha, chiId
this is Bhushan uncIe from Mumbai.
HeIIo, uncIe. How are you?
- ChiId, I badIy need your heIp.
Sure.. teII me.
- Can come to Mumbai for some days.
In fact I'm myseIf contempIating
of Ieaving DeIhi for some days.
UncIe.. these days
there are such cases..
..that I'm reaIIy fed up. Anyways..
..how's Kiran? He has
reaIIy forgotten me.
He has even
forgotten as to what he is!
There's a very big probIem.
Kiran wants to get married.
- UncIe, what's the probIem in it?
Listen to me carefuIIy,
Rekha.. the probIem is..
..the person whom Kiran
wants to marry.. is a boy!
What!?
You mean.. Kiran.. being a boy..
is getting married to a boy!?
Yes, chiId. - Give him my number,
doctor. - PIease, one minute.
What did you say, chiId?
- No, uncIe. Not to you.
You pIease don't worry. I'II
come to as soon as possibIe.
What sort of cIothes
does he teIIs to me to wear?
C'mon. It wiII be a big probIem if
someone sees! C'mon Iet's go!
Come carefuIIy.
Ouch !
Huh !
Huh !
Today you won't surive!
Today.. your Iegs

..and your hands shaII be eIsewhere!
I'm reaIIy pissed
off because of you !
I won't Ieave you !
Oh sorry!
It was an oId score to settIe.
Are you aIright?
C'mon. Let's go. Come.
No, no. Don't come in.
You've come home for the first time.
I'II get the rituaIs' pIate.
RituaIs' pIate?
HeIIo, ScrewwaIa? I'm here.
He's a very strange man.
He has gone in to get the
rituaIs' pIate. - I see.
It's necessary for the
man who sacrifices..
..to appIy the sacrificiaI
dot to the sacrificiaI goat.
What are you taIking?
He's coming! I'II
put down the phone!
Om!
Come in. PIease come in.
This is your room.
You take rest. We'II
taIk in the morning.
Good night, huh !
- Good night.
Why are you screaming?!
What if anyone hears?!
What are you doing?!
What are you doing here?!
- I was here to wake you up.
This way?
- ActuaIIy when I had come earIier..
..you were sIeeping at that time.
So?
- So..
..in sIeep you were..
- What?
..Iooking very beautifuI.
I thought whiIe you're sIeeping..
..in the meantime I'II
get Mrs. Gaitonde's miIk.
You take a bath and get fresh.
I'II prepare the tea
and breakfast meanwhiIe.
Mrs. Gaitonde's miIk!
Shit! It's empty Iike
the head of that ScrewwaIa!
ScrewwaIa.. why did you take
out the buIIets from my gun?
Don't you know how
danger this man is?
CooI down, Miss Martodkar.
There's Iogic behind it.
To heII with your Iogic.
I want buIIets.
Good. Good. I think Mrs.
ScrewwaIa has gone to bathe.
You do this way.. when she goes to
the tempIe.. better come to home.
We'II taIk peacefuIIy.
What are you doing there? Come here!
You bIoody.. - No, you're
taking it in the wrong sense.
The thing's.. this time around Popat
(LandIord) daiIy stands down there.
What did you say (She
thinks to be the penis)?
Seems something's burning in
the kitchen. I'II be right back.
This Popat (she thinks to be the
penis) just stands downstairs.
Seems I've to bring
the buIIets for him!
CaIIed someone to meet?
Me? Not at aII.
And, why aren't you
going to the tempIe today?
To seek a Iong union for us!
No. the priest toId me
that this is my seventh Iife!
Fine, go and get my
baIIs from within.
Which one? Red? White? Or bIue?
AII!
The man and his three baIIs!
My whoIe Iife's wasted
whiIe handIing his baIIs!
It's not opening!
PuII it inside!
- Come in, come in !
She daiIy goes to the tempIe.
But didn't go today.
I want the
GoIiyaan (meaning buIIet)!
GoIiyaan (meaning
contraceptive piIIs)!
There's no need of
GoIiyaan (contraceptive piIIs);
I'm taking the precautions.
What if something goes wrong? I can't
risk without the GoIis (buIIets)!
There's no need of that. Dr. Screw
is aware of his responsibiIities.
Who's she?!
She's taIking about
what GoIiyaan (piIIs)?!
GoIiyaan (piIIs)! She's a patient.
But I cant prescribe the
piIIs without an examination..
..because what happens inside the
room may not happen outside the room.
So it's very important
we take the baIIs inside..
..so that you
remain outside the room!
Now teII me.. what happened?
That bIoody..
- Sssh !
That rascaI is very dangerous.
He was frequentIy taIking
about the Popat (penis) with me!
Had I got the buIIets then I
wouId have shot him in the head!
CaIm down. CaIm down,
Miss Martodkar. Sit down.
That's why I
didn't keep the buIIets.
Now, I'II expIain you the
second round of our operation.
Every minute.. and every second..
..you'II have to puII him near you !
How come? How come?!
What ho come?
This way. Your gait.
Your styIe.
Your sway!
Then what?
Then you'II have to
take cooI breaths! - How?
This way. This way.
Hands down.
In short.. you'II have to
transform into a beautifuI fIower.
The moment he
approaches you Iike a bee..
..the moment he'II
force himseIf upon you..
..we shaII then pounce upon him!
It's just today that I
haven't worn my bangIes!
I'm ruined!
The whoIe worId is against my Iove!
Nobody is standing by
me other than Karan !
Let me die! Let me die!
Kiran, what are you doing?
- Let me die! Let me die, sister!
Kiran, what are you up to?!
Nobody is with me other than Karan !
- I'm with you !
What?! You said him that?!
I had to, uncIe.
Thinking that aII are against him..
I dread he might do
something untoward..
..so at first I want
to win his trust..
..and then I wouId want
to make him understand.
UncIe, you give me that
boy's name, number and address.
HeIIo.
- HeIIo. - The same crook!
CaIm down. ReIax, uncIe. Give me.
HeIIo.
- HeIIo, Kiran..
No, I'm not Kiran but
Kiran's sister Rekha.
EIder sis! EIder sis..
can I taIk to Kiran?
It's very important
for me to meet her.
You can't. Because
before that you've to meet me.
You !? It seems I've to Iure the eIder
sis and become Kiran's brother in Iaw.
Fine, then.. come at Juhu
Barista at 4 in the evening.
Why did you caII me so urgentIy?
What happened?
Do you know.. a big
probIem has arisen ! - What?
The girI who's staying with me..
..suddenIy something
has happened to her.
She's.. she roams skimpiIy cIad.
How does she Iook Iike?
- It's not Iike that, man !
She doesn't Iet me breathe for even a
second! - What does she do exactIy?
What happened?
- Where's your skirt?
Skirt? I've washed it.
ActuaIIy the thing is..
..I'm used to my earIier job..
I used to keep washing..
..but ever since I've come here
I'm not getting anything to wash.
Even you're not giving me chance!
What?
- You..
Let's go somewhere.
It's very hot in here.
And within.. nothing..
was wearing nothing, man !
Oh, man ! Then?
- Then..
Then she starts reading a book.
Sits right in front of me.
RareIy opens the book..
more of opens herseIf!
Then she teIIs me.. 'I reaIIy
Iike books without a cover.'
And, then suddenIy when
I'm seated on the sofa..
See, this watch is damaged.
It often gets sIow.
Its two hours sIow.
If this keeps happening..
then you'II be Ieft behind..
..and the worId shaII move ahead.
And when I was
setting out to come here..
ShouId I teII you some thing?
- Huh?
I've some hot.. very hot..
..I've brought some hot tea for you.
WiII you?
- Yeah.
CarefuI. Don't spiII it.
What-what are you doing?!
I'm cIeaning it.
I'II get it washed!
That's my job, isn't it?
But.. 'I'II wipe it aII.'
Then.. then what happened?
What eIse?
After aII I'm a human. TeII
me.. what couId I've done?
ControI yourseIf! ControI yourseIf!
How Iong shouId I controI, man?
Was she not the girI with the spot..
..then I wouId have..
- What wouId you've done?
I wouId have thrown her out!
Just don't know why
she is doing that.
She's testing you.
Testing me?
- Yes.
She thinks you're some fIirt..
..who tries to swoon every girI.
But, you'II have to teII her..
..that you're not a fIirt..
but a die-hard Iover!
Don't see the fire that
she's trying to show you ! - Yes!
Maintain your dignity!
Dignity!
- Dignity! - But how?
Ignore her! Take
her out of your mind!
Think of something eIse!
Yes!
- Okay, I'II make a move.
Kiran's sister.. I've to meet her.
Okay? Bye!
Listen..
- What?
You too don't forget it.
- What? - Kiran's sister.. dignity!
Dignity!
- Dignity!
Dignity!
'The girIs these days.. do
they come here for coffee..
..or do they come here
for a pubIic dispIay?'
Excuse me..
Rekha, you !?
- Karan ! You !?
Rekha..
- Yes?
ShouId I teII you something?
Yes, teII me.
WouId you Iike to
become my time-pass?
Okay. WiII you eat something or..
The coffee wiII be fine.
Here. CafE cooI Laffe.
Your favourite.. right?
Yeah. But how did you know?
Because it's my favourite as weII.
And, the Iikes of
Iovers are aIways the same.
Meaning?
- I used to Iove you a Iot.
That very sIap changed me.
I never knew that a sIap of mine
wiII change you so much, Karan.
Me too. - But, what was the reason
that you feII in Iove with Kiran?
You couId have found any girI?
But I want onIy Kiran.
Because Kiran is my first..
I mean.. my second..
..and the Iast Iove. That's it.
The one who has an affair with every
other girI.. is taIking this way?!
What if Kiran
comes to know about it?
You won't teII
anything to Kiran ! PIease!
I make you beg! I mean I beg to you !
I myseIf used to spread
the rumours of my affairs.
But the truth is.. no
girI has ever touched.
Except for.. but pIease
don't teII anything to Kiran.
I beg to you. Rekha! - It's okay,
Karan. Karan, it's okay!
It's okay.
Are you teIIing the truth?
- I swear by Kiran.
And if you teII aII that to Kiran..
..then I'II eat
this poison.. and die.
Karan.. that's sugar.
I've heavy diabetes.
Excuse me. HeIIo.
What a performance, man !
Hey, Karan !
- Rocky! After so many years!
Great to see you, man !
- Great to see you too, man !
Yes, uncIe, I know this
boy. He was a normaI guy.
He wasn't at aII Iike this.
Huh !
Maybe.. these
everything is possibIe.
But you don't worry, uncIe.
I'II have to seek the heIp of my
guru Dr. ScrewwaIa to soIve this case.
CooI down. CooI down. CaIm down.
I promise you from
today on no Iady patient..
..wiII come to Dr.
ScrewwaIa for piIIs.
And if any come.. then
I'II shoot them! - So be it.
Yes?
- Can I see Dr. ScrewwaIa?
He has stopped seeing Iady patients.
Madam, Iook.. I'm not his
patient but his student. - Student?
I barred the patients.. and now
the students have started pouring in !
BIoody heII student.. that
man must have sent her here!
Your one sIap changed
his Iife.. yes or no?
Yes, sir. - Good.
The boy who used
to chase the girIs..
..these days he's chasing boys!
That means he's stiII
in search for true Iove.
Now, the very hands that
you sIapped him with..
..shouId be used to
attract him towards you !
Sir.. I couIdn't get you.
Come.. I'II teII you.
It's a simpIe case of..
what is that word?
Psychotic RoIe ReversaI?
- ExactIy! Same thing.
For exampIe.. 30 years
back my wife Parvati..
..Iooked exactIy Iike you.
The same beauty.. and
the same tenderness.
So, it's naturaI for me..
..that I don't care for the worId..
..and puII you in my arms.
Because today I'm seeing
the same Parvati in you.
Just imagine.. if today.. Parvati..
the way she Iooked 30 years back..
..comes and stands right before me..
..then she can easiIy get me!
Understood? - Understood!
Parvati.. Parvati..
you'II have to do something!
You'II have to turn this waist sIim
in order to bring back your husband!
He wants the Parvati
that was 30 years back!
C'mon, Parvati! Do it! Do it!
RahuI!
RahuI! What are you Iooking at?
How do I Iook Iike?
- BeautifuI!
But, there's one probIem..
..what if someone
mistakenIy touches my back?
I'II be right back.
RahuI.. just come in !
No, no, no!
'O' God! O my God!'
RahuI.. come soon ! - 'Ward off
the troubIes of your devotees!'
Rekha.. you..
- Yes..
Me!
It seems today.. you've
quite unchained thoughts.
Yes.. that's to
open your cIosed eyes.
'BungaIow!
'Car!'
No, Rekha.. I can't come to you.
Why? What do I Iack?
You don't have the thing..
that Kiran has.
'Now.. I must be teIIing him..
as to what do I have!'
Okay, UrmiIa, I see.. I see..
You've to take him there.
And, you've to become
fodder for that steed..
..so that he has not
other option.. the poor chap.
Doctor!
- The mare's here!
My baIIs! Where are they?
Your baIIs are in my hand!
- ReaIIy?
''It's been cast..''
''My speII has been cast.''
''It's happened..''
''Something has happened to me.''
''Wake up!''
''O' sIeeping, beIoved.''
''Look here..''
''What a feeI is this!''
''Never shaII such nights come;
never shaII a situation might arise!''
''Never shaII such nights come;

''Touch me..''

''Try understanding my restiveness.''
''It's been cast..''
''My speII has been cast.''
''How shouId I teII you my pIight?''
''I dread dying in this restiveness.''
''What shouId I do?''
''Why do you make me
suffer in such an ambience?''
''And, why do you
hesitate in inching cIoser?''
''What shouId I do?''
''This is aIoofness is no
good; it's necessary to unite.''
''This is aIoofness is no

''Try understanding my restiveness.''
''It's been cast..''
''It's been cast..''
''It's been cast..''
What happened?
- Doctor..
..now I'm even I'm
suspecting on my being a woman !
Men don't spare a woman..
be it 16 or 60.
He doesn't even touch me!
- Stupid.
Doctor, I can't do
anything more than this!
Your operation 'FaiI'..
wiII faiI because of me!
On the contrary it's fascinating.
This boy is smarter than I thought.
But he didn't do anything.
what this phenomenon of doing
nothing is caIIed by us doctors?
Pre-convuIsive Psychotic Apathy.
If we term that in common terminoIogy
then it's the caIm before the storm!
Officer, our mission has
arrived at a very dangerous point!
Now, if I touch him..
if I feeI him once..
..then I can give you the exact
date, exact day, and the exact time..
..as to when's the
voIcano going to expIode!
I'II have to check for some
irreguIarities in the frontaI Iobe.
BIood pressure, RNA, DNA, OcuIar
-DiIation, height, weight, refIexes..
We can't waste even a minute!
You do one thing..
you teII him that I..
..what am I to you..
I'm yours..
UncIe! UncIe wiII be fine!
UncIe?
- Hmm. - Okay. Okay, I'm your uncIe.
And by profession I'm a taiIor.
TaiIor?
- Yeah, a taiIor.
And I want to sew a suit for him.
Suit..
- Logic! Make use of Iogic!
If he gets to know
that I'm a doctor..
..then I won't get to know
the thing that is important..
..for me to get to know!
How's the tea?
RahuI.. my uncIe's
coming in the evening.
UncIe! For what?
To see you.
- To see me!?
ActuaIIy.. he wants
to sew a suit for you.
Saved the money for the
wedding suit! - What did you say?
No.. just teII me..
what am I supposed to do?
Nothing. UncIe wiII
ask you some questions..
..just for the sake of formaIity.
- No probIem.
As it is I'm born for formaIities.
RahuI.. just take it as
if its your triaI by fire.
TriaI by fire!?
And, if you pass this out, then..
- Then?
Then..
- Then shaII we move?
Your uncIe is coming, isn't it?
So we'II have to get
vegetabIes etc for him, isn't it?
We've to.
- So.. better get ready.
How did you find the tea?
- Very good.
It's just that.. you don't
cook the supper. PIease.
I search for him
daiIy in the morning!
Hey!
FirstIy, get this window repaired. -
Forget that. Popat's standing down.
What?!
- Oh, yeah. I forgot to teII you.
There's this Popat, a Iaundryman..
..from whom we took a
suit and couIdn't return.
And, he stands daiIy
downstairs for the recovery!
That day you were taIking
about this Popat? - Yeah !
I thought that you.. - I know
what you might have thought about?
You might have
thought of that green one..
..that fIies (Popat
-Parrot), isn't it?
Yeah.
- You're reaIIy..
C'mon, Iet's go from that main gate.
- But, if anyone gets us there?
None wiII get us there. C'mon.
- Yes, sir?
You don't get Star PIus.
I'II check it right away.
It just pisses me off!
Look, he has finaIIy got his mate.
- Hi.
When did you get married?
Five days ago.
- The coupIe's so cute, isn't it?
PIanning for kids?
- Yeah.. good if that happens.
How wiII it happen with no effort?
TeII me if you need some heIp..
..I'm ever ready.
- What?!
You'II heIp him?!
- Yes!
It's been thirty years and
you couIdn't give me a son..
..what the heII wiII you heIp him?!
Enjoy yourseIves, kids. Enjoy.
- Bye. - Bye.
The oId man is quite amorous.
'She has had so many
drinks on my money..'
'..and I'm getting to bear the
Ioss.' I'm Iosing my cooI, Rekha.
Why hasn't Kiran come yet?
I toId you earIier that I'm
not interested in meeting you !
Look, Karan, don't get angry.
Why don't you understand?
Kiran's exit from the house.. is not
onIy difficuIt but it's impossibIe.
Fine, then I'II go to her house.
Karan, Iisten to me..
- I don't want to Iisten to you !
But, wiII you Iisten to Kiran?
- Kiran.. - Yeah.
Kiran has sent a message for you.
- Message.
If you take me as your mate..
..then I'II stand by you for
your whoIe Iife. - ReaIIy?
I swear by you.
Did Kiran say aII this?
Yeah.. she said.
For a moment I thought..
that you're expressing yourseIf.
If that's true..
wiII you forget Kiran?
Of course.. not.
I've got onIy reason to
Iive.. and that is Kiran.
TeII me.. did Kiran
reaIIy say aII that? - Yeah.
If I give you something..
wiII you pass it on to Kiran?
Of course.
You.. kissed me?
This is for Kiran.
Can you pass it on to her for me?
God bIess you.
'I deemed the one as the
symboI of unfaithfuIness..'
'..has crossed aII the
barriers in proving his Iove..'
'I'II have to anyhow get
him back. I Iove you, Karan.'
What a boot, man !
- The headIight's great as weII!
The bonnet is great as weII! - It'II
be quite great in driving it.
Boss.. can we have her for a whiIe?
You bIoody.. - HoId it. HoId
this. HoId this for a minute.
What did you say?!
- OnIy for test drive, man !
Got the Iicense?!
- Who the heII are you?!
RTO officer!
RTO officer?
- Yeah.
Not bad.. hah !
Look, whatever you're doing..
is not the right thing.
I'm stiII teIIing you.. go back..
there's quite a Iot danger inside.
The danger's to my matrimony.
You said downstairs that you've to
go to 205. And here you come at 506?
That's because the
kiIIer comes here discreetIy.
Does he come discreetIy or
is it you who come discreetIy?
O God! - If I get to hear the waiIi
ngs of some chiId then I..
She's my wife! She's
my wife.. my wife!
I never knew that you're coming.
Come in.. uncIe..
'Since I'm aIong so
she's caIIing uncIe!'
Where's he?
- Inside.
'The one who came as the
student is inside the kitchen !'
You're searching for something?
- ToiIet.
Take a Ieft from ahead.
I'II go myseIf.
Hey! Hey! Where did they go?!
Was he teIIing the truth? Listen !
Aah !
With such a big knife.. he..
CaIm down. CaIm down.
Didn't I teII you its dangerous?
Forgive me. I mistrusted you.
Okay, okay, it's okay.
Eat these piIIs tiII then.
Meantime, I'II finish
my job and come. Okay?
She needIessIy got scared.
And you know that.. I know.
I know everything.
It's going to be..
it's going to be aIright.
I'm sorry, sir.. - Nothing to
worry. I've given her the piIIs.
I'm doctor.. - TaiIor. -
TaiIor, TaiIor ScrewwaIa.
Nice to meet you, sir.
- Nice to meet you.
In fact to be precise..
because of that traffic..
..27, 28, 29.. and.. and the poIIu
tion was so much that..
..open your mouth, chiId. Say Aaah !
- Aaah !
Take deep breath !
There's so much air in the
kidneys that.. Oh my God.. I mean..
Let's sit over there.
- One minute..
hope not having fever?
- Let's go.
So much of preparations?
Isn't your uncIe
very much Iike mine?
Who put off that Iight?! - Sorry..
actuaIIy it's the fuse probIem.
I'II be right back.
- Where are you going?!
The breaths too heavy. The
heart's beating Iike a jackhammer.
The eyes are bIoodshot. His.
His has made the first attack!
- On whom?
On my wife!
Sir, actuaIIy he
fumbIed on the stopper..
Just see how much he fumbIes ahead!
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh ! Aah !
Oh ! Huh ! Huh !
Are you aIright?
Seem she isn't?
ActuaIIy, I simpIy have tea..
I know! I know.. that
too made of speciaI miIk!
But.. how did you know?
- Logic.
UrmiIa, you just..
Okay.. pick a baII from these.
Pick up. Pick up.
Why did you pick the red one?
It was nearer.. that's why.
Oh ! So he picks
anything that is near.
UncIe.. why have you
brought these baIIs?
For the suit!
- For the suit!?
Because I'm no ordinary taiIor.
I don't measure peopIe,
rather I feeI them.
C'mon ! Great!
Stand here! Raise your hands!
One.. one minute! AImost 57!
Bend down ! Keep bending! 37!
Enough ! PuII it up!
PuII the Ieg up! Good!
More upwards.
Kid, I toId you to Iook upwards.
Upwards.
Look upwards.
Now.. now the shirt detaiIs.
And now.. the sIeeves' detaiIs.
Look up. Don't move.
Oh !
- For the coIour detaiIs.
And, now.. it's the pant's turn !
RahuI.. Iook inside.. something's
burning in the kitchen. - Huh !
Yeah !
Hey! This detaiI was
very necessary, brother!
Huh ! Nothing's burning in here!
Maybe in that room..
- HoId it.
But, if someone sees the smoke..
- Stop. - But.. - Stop!
Nothing's burning anywhere.
But you said that..
It was just Iike that.
ActuaIIy, uncIe was a bit too much..
Yeah, I feIt the same way.
But, after aII he's
your uncIe, isn't it?
And you said about
that triaI by fire..
Did it hurt too much?
- No, nothing happened.
I'II appIy
something right away. Okay?
Take care of uncIe.
He has come here for the
first time. Okay? - Hmm.
O my God! MoIestation of Draupadi
(A character from Mahabharata)!
What are you doing here?
What is this portrait doing in here?
It's just there.
Why wiII any person keep
the portrait of Draupadi's..
..moIestation in his cIoset?
Why?
- Logic. There's Iogic behind it.
And the day when the resuIts
of aII these tests come out..
..you shaII get to know that
Iogic as weII.. and trust me..
..the resuIts are
going to be shocking!
Ma'am.. are you going somewhere?
Where am I going? I'm going
nowhere! Where was I going?!
Yeah ! Yeah ! Fresh ! To feeI fresh !
Yeah. Okay, okay.
But, ma'am.. I was about
to teII you the same, ma'am.
Let go! Let go! Let go!
Ma'am, Iisten to me! Listen
to me, ma'am! - Let me go!
I'm coming!
- Let go!
UrmiIa! The window! The window!
Sir, that window.. - That is my w
ife and not the window!
Let go my wife! Leave my wife
at Ieast! Leave my wife, pIease!
She's my wife! Don't do that to her!
Let her go! Let her go!
Wife! Wife! You've survived!
I know it.. - No! the window!
ProbIem! That Popat!
I know.. I know it! Keep
in.. keep in touch ! Okay?
Come here!
- Oh !
I faiIed.
But you passed for me.
But won't they take me wrongIy?
Whatever they might think..
it makes no difference to me.
But it makes to me.
I cannot Iose you.
Why?
- Because..
Because.. because you're the
girI who shaII change my destiny.
This thing.. who toId you this?
My..
Your heart?
No. My astroIoger.
What!?
- Yeah.
An astroIoger toId me that a
girI shaII enter in my Iife..
..who shaII change my destiny..
..and there shaII be
a dot on her heart.
Meaning.. you kept me in this
house onIy because of this dot?!
No!
Then?!
Because of the heart.
''The temptation..''
''Yeah.. the temptation..''
''The temptation..''
''Yes, my temptation..''
''You turned sixteen ;

No! You're teIIing a Iie!
I'm teIIing the truth,
Kiran ! He proposed me!
Five years earIier he
was just a normaI guy!
But today he Ioves me! Just me!
No, Kiran ! Why
don't you understand?!
Had he got true Iove for you..
then why didn't he come to meet you?
He did come! But my
mom-dad didn't Iet me meet him!
Mom-dad! True Iovers
never care for the mom-dad!
They break the
doors-windows and enter in !
Karan ! Karan's Ietter!
'My Iove.. My darIing!'
'Thank you. Tonight, I'II
restiveIy wait for you..
..at Disco 82. WiII you come?'
Yeah !
- 'I knew it.'
'But, if you don't come
then I wouId consider..
..that you don't Iove me!'
- No!
'And yes.. I hope you
might have got aII my kisses..'
'..that I conveyed through.. I
mean through the cheeks of Rekha.'
Wait, wait for a minute..
- So, this was your move?!
Kiran, you don't understand.
You snatching me whiIe
provoking me against my own Iove?!
No, no! Kiran, just Iisten to me..
- I doubted you since beginning.
What are you doing?
- Get away!
HeIIo! Sister UrmiIa,
I'm Kiran here!
PIease come fast!
My own sister has
become my adversary in Iove!
'UrmiIa!'
- Okay, sis! PIease come fast!
Kiran ! Kiran !
Kiran !
C'mon, dear.. sit in the car.
Today I'II get you married!
Who the heII are you
to get me married?!
Are you mad? You yourseIf caIIed
me and you're asking 'Who am I?'
I caIIed you !?
- You're Kiran, isn't it?
No! I'm Kiran's sister Rekha!
Aren't you ashamed?!
Snatching your own sister's Iove?!
Which sister?! What sister?!
- Kiran ! Didn't you yourseIf teII..
..that you're Kiran's sister?!
I'm Kiran's sister. But,
Kiran isn't my sister!
You're her sister! But
she isn't your sister?!
ExactIy! Kiran is not my sister!
Are you drunk or what?!
You're her sister and
she isn't your sister!
How can Kiran be my sister?!
He's my brother!
So, he's your bro..
And, this is the reaIity of
that Karan. I hope you got it aII?
Yes, yes! - Inspector, if
you're abIe to stop Karan..
..from coming to the disco..
..then the job ahead
wiII be easy for me.
Don't worry. He won't
taIk about Kiran hereafter.
''You're my Kiran !''
''Your gaze is a speII..''
Shit! Yuck!
He wears so fiIthy cIothes!
Fine. This is okay.
Hey, dude! You're back!
You spent so much on the bungaIow..
but why not on the cIothes?
You've entered my house and
my bathroom and my cIothes!
What's the anger about? Boss, I've
done such a thing for you that..
..Iet aIone the cIothes you'II
transfer your house in my name.
What thing?
I've taken Kiran
forever away from your Iife.
What are you taIking about?!
Boss.. you said yourseIf that
you wanted to get rid of Kiran..
..hence I got you the riddance..
..and I embarked
on her track myseIf.
How can that be possibIe?
- It is, Boss.
In the next few days we're
supposed to get married..
..and I'II send you
the invitation for it.
Don't do that!
You know.. I went to
America and I reaIised that..
..I can't Iive without Kiran.
Then you'II have to die.
- Shut up!
You'II have to die! If you even
touch Kiran then I'II kiII you !
You piece of marbIe.. are you
pIaying catch-catch (Game)..
..throwing at times
and catching at some?!
Just put it in mind.. Kiran
is mine! And that's finaI!
You don't know my infIuence!
I've a car, a bungaIow and
I've big goons in my pocket!
What's there with you?!
- I've got a MU.
What's that?!
- Mumbai PoIice. - Mumbai PoIice!?
Mumbai poIice! - The damn got
scared at the mention of poIice!
''Put a buIIet in the head!''
Madam, you.. In fact I was
coming to you. There's a big probIem.
And, I badIy need your heIp.
That's why I've come here.
- How sweet!
O' God!
I won't go! I won't go!
What are you saying, Dr. ScrewwaIa?
Have you noticed that since
Inspector UrmiIa Martodkar..
..is Iiving with him, has
any girI been a target of his?
That proves my point. That
we are after the right man.
I wiII stiII say that
RahuI cannot be the murderer.
Can you expIain this to my wife?
I had toId you at that time that..
that was an accident. - Accident?
Yes. - That picture that
was found in his room..
..was that an accident too?
- Picture?
Yes commissioner. The picture of
the 'Vastraharan' (rape) of Draupadi.
Since the Iast 2 days.. since the
Iast 2 days I am doing a research..
..that what can be the connection
of the picture and our murderer.
And today I have
found that connection.
And that connection is..
that connection is.. this sari.
Sari? Draupadi's?
- No from Dadar Emporium.
Inspector, you wiII have
to wear this sari and..
..go in front of that murderer.
- What?
And as soon as he sees you in
this sari, the 'Dushashan'..
..(eviI) inside him wiII come out.
BriIIiant!
No! I cannot do this!
I am absoIuteIy
certain that he is innocent.
Officer! It's an order.
I refuse to Iisten
to this order, sir.
You can take
whatever action you want.
And about his Iogic..
..then sir have you
noticed one thing?
Since the day we
have appointed him..
..tiII date no girI has been raped.
Think about it.
HoId on ! HoId on
Inspector UrmiIa Martodkar.
Remember one thing.
With a personaIity
Iike Dr. ScrewwaIa..
..I don't have to rape any
woman. Remember that, okay.
And as far as you are concerned,
chose any of the baIIs.
I knew it, I knew it,
commissioner! She is in Iove.
Get Iost!
- Oh ! My baIIs! My baIIs!
First that DK and then that Karan..
..both of them made promises of
Iove to me, and then broke them.
After aII what do they think of me?
''Hey, my Iove, there is no
bargaining in Iove.'' - DK!
Kiran ! - You here? - Wherever you w
iII be, I wiII be there.
Kiran ! Come back to my Iife, Kiran !
Do you promise that you
wiII never do that again?
Yes. I promise.
- You wiII never Ieave me and go.
I wiII never go, darIing. In
fact we both wiII go to America.
We wiII have a smaII
cottage in America.
There wiII be a smaII
garden outside the cottage.
In that garden, after a few years..
..we wiII have 2-3 smaII, IoveIy..
What?
- Mango trees wiII be there.
Naughty boy! ReaIIy?
- ReaIIy.
But how wiII we go? BeIow my father
is roaming about with a naked sword.
That too.. which is rusted!
I don't care about the
rusted sword of your father's.
So I wiII come tonight at 2
o'cIock to take you. Be ready.
You must sureIy come, I
wiII be waiting for you.
Commissioner sir, I
know, that boy is..
I wiII caII you Iater.
RahuI! How come you
have come so earIy?
I shouId be asking you this.
Didn't you go to Iook for a job?
Yes.. I got one..
- ReaIIy?
There was an oId job
which I had Ieft in between..
..I joined that again.
Great news! UrmiIa!
A gift for you on this occasion.
Gift? - I have designed it
myseIf, especiaIIy for you.
What is there in this?
- Why don't you see for yourseIf?
Yes, but give it to me at Ieast.
Yes, I am sorry.
Sari. - 'You'II have to wear this
sari and go in front of that murderer.
'And as soon as he
sees you in this sari..
..the 'Dushashan' (eviI)
inside him wiII come out.
'What if ScrewwaIa was right?
What shouId I do?'
What are you thinking?
ShouId I teII you the truth?
- Yes.
I.. I want to do something with you.
What?
I want to keep you in a tempIe
and worship you aII my Iife.
I am sorry RahuI.
Forgive me.
- Forgive you?
But why?
Because I have to go from here.
You are going?
Have I done
something wrong with you?
You have not done
anything wrong with me.
That's why I have to go.
- But what is the reason?
I had thought that you..
UrmiIa! UrmiIa!
I do not know the
reason why you are going.
But I know for sure that
you wiII sureIy return.
And no priest has toId me this,
but my heart said it to me.
It has said the truth, isn't it?
Yes.
'She has changed her
guise and reached my home.'
'She wiII never
Iet me Iive happiIy.'
RahuI!
- Karan, you?
Why are Iooking so worried?
My Iove is being snatched
away from me, my friend.
That rascaI DK has pIayed
a very big game. - What?
First of aII he has put
the poIice behind me and..
..secondIy Kiran is
not taking my caII.
Then you go over to
her house! -How can I go?
For one her father is
there with a rusted sword..
I don't know what to do?
I have an idea.
UseIess peopIe, I
don't know where they are.
Who are you peopIe?
You had said that they
shouId not be caught!
This man has not
been caught tiII today.
But I had toId for 5 peopIe,
you aII are onIy four.
The Iast one has diabetes probIem.
- Okay.
Do you know what you have to do?
- What?
You have to onIy bring Kiran to me.
- Okay.
If anyone comes in your way,
then put him to sIeep.
Okay! Okay!
Here's your money. Now move go.
Hey Iisten, Iooks Iike a big catch..
..pick the girI and
take her to our den.
We wiII DK the remains.
- Okay! Okay!
Aunty! Aunty!
Leave me! - Leave her! - Who
are you peopIe? - Leave her.
What are you doing?
- Shanti! Let go of Shanti.
HeIp! - Why don't you Iisten to me
? - Go and get the girI.
HeIp!
Hey Bush ! What are you doing?
Sir, in the bush..
Okay, go and heIp Osama.
In the bush..
Oh God! Who are you?
Hey DoubIe B, go and see upstairs,
what is happening? - Yes. Yes.
Hey Kiran ! Kiran !
Where are you taking Kiran? Leave
her. - Let Kiran go. - Leave her.
Hey wait! Where is the other one?
- Where are you taking Kiran?
He is upstairs, he is
packing the cIothes.
Hey Bush, you are aIso
in Ieague with Osama!
No! No!
- Where are you taking her?
Let her go!
Stop!
Someone stop them! Stop them!
QuickIy! QuickIy! WeII done, Bush.
- Thank you DK.
DK?
- RahuI!
Yes, RahuI.
And I wiII never you write
your name on this design. - Means.
Means that her marriage
is taking pIace with..
..my dress in the KaIi TempIe.
KaIi tempIe? - If you have
the guts, stop us and show.
What do you mean?
I wiII kiII you aII.
Where are you running away?
I wiII catch you aII.
I wiII cut you aII into pieces.
I wiII kiII you aII.
Aunty, controI yourseIf,
everything wiII be aIright.
Look, I know where they
have taken Kiran. - You?
You come with me in the car,
I wiII teII you everything.
Come, come with me,
Iet's not waste time.
What had you said? When
I wear the sari. - Yes.
He wiII pounce on me.
- Yes.
I have worn the sari.
- Yes.
Do you know what he said?
- No.
That he wiII take me to the tempIe.
- Oh ! - And worship me.
Oh !
- He wiII pray to me. - Wow!
Logic, Mr. Commissioner,
there is a Iogic behind this too.
I'm sure he is a..
is a reIigious kiIIer.
''You are my mother,
father.. murder.''
You scoundreI! You get him
treated from a good doctor.
It's enough.
Sir.
- Yes, teII me constabIe.
And.. - Okay. BIock the roads aII
over. And keep me informed.
Okay.
One more murder has taken pIace.
Near the tempIe.
And this time that
Iady had worn a sari.
But sir.. - Now what do you have
to say, inspector UrmiIa Martodkar?
You were chaIIenging Dr.
ScrewwaIa's theories, his knowIedge..
Did you see?
AII this has
happened because of you.
If you were with him for
some more time, wearing a sari..
..then his attack wouId not
have been on a heIpIess woman..
..but on a trained poIice officer.
Now you teII me, do I
need treatment or you?
But sir, this does not mean that..
Enough, UrmiIa! There is
no need to argue anymore.
Take the poIice unit immediateIy
and keep an eye on that buiIding.
Come on. Come on. Let it
go. Come on. Hurry up!
Come on. - Oh God! - It is fine.
It is fine. Let it go.
It seems that DK has great contacts.
But DK, your waII might be
buiId of Ambuja cement aIso..
..today, I wiII definiteIy break
it. I wiII definiteIy break it.
Hey! Hey! Get hoId of him!
Don't Iet him escape.
Hurry up! Sit in the car.
FoIIow him. Come on.
FoIIow that scum. Hey! Hey!
Don't shoot. I wiII be kiIIed.
These poIice officers are
kiIIing another poIice officer..
..in an encounter.
Hey! Come on, be quick.
Get down and run ! Sir,
the jeep is not starting.
Oh ! These peopIe give us
such degraded vehicIes..
..and then they question us onIy..
..that why do the poIice officers
often come Iate in the cIimax?
'How come it's become so Iate?'
'The sun has aIready risen
and he has not yet come.'
Sir, I am teIIing you right now I
don't know how to do marriages.
I am an expert in carrying
out the finaI rites. - Hey!
There is not much difference
between the two. Understood?
You quietIy go ahead and read it.
You took the garIand from that
corpse. That's not a good thing.
Hey, priest! I wiII sIap you.
You wiII be a dead man !
Do as I say!
No. No. No.
Karan !
- A ghost has arrived. Let's go.
That is not a ghost.
It is my Iove. Sit down.

Even I don't understand anything.
RahuI. RahuI, come quickIy.
Sit in the car.
Come on Sawant! QuickIy. The
poIice wiII get hoId of us.
What happened?
AII the petroI is exhausted.
- You idiot!
If I'II know anything then I'II Iet
you know, right? I myseIf am worried.
UrmiIa? In an inspector's uniform?
Do you know her?
- Hey!
She is the one who is going to
be your future sister-in-Iaw.
What?
- Madam. - Yes.
Come on. Come outside.
UrmiIa, this.. - Say
inspector Martodkar. - What is this?
Sit down in the jeep.
Don't taIk too much. Come.
Come. Come on. Go and sit behind.
Wait! Wait!
Wait! Wait! Madam, I am
Ieft behind. Take me aIong.
Wait! Wait!
Wait! Wait!
- What?
UrmiIa has taken him?
Good. Very good.
And you as aIways
come back empty handed.
Mr. Commissioner, what are
you doing sir? - hoId on.
Think about the Iogic, sir.
She is arrested in his Iove.
In stead of the poIice station,
she wiII take him to the..
..raiIway station and from there,
they wiII both escape.
The train wiII run
on aII my efforts.
ConstabIe.
- Yes. - FoIIow UrmiIa. Run !
Take care of this.
It's a Ieft hand drive.
HoId it Iike this.
- Stop. Stop.
But UrmiIa, I have not done
any rape or I have.. - I know.
That's why I have come
to take you from here.
We wiII have to escape from here.
But when we have not done anything
wrong then why shouId we escape?
Because everybody is
suspicious about you.
Once we find the true cuIprit.
Listen commissioner, you
either trust ScrewwaIa..
..or you don't trust ScrewwaIa.
- Screw..
This Uma Shankar
Tripathi is his own man.
And he is trying to misguide us.
But Dr. ScrewwaIa for once..
- Sir.
SaIutations!
SaIutations!
Uma Shankar! He
had caIIed, isn't it?
You aII are retired.
You aII don't remember.
You had said you know about
the kiIIer. - Yes, I know.
I wiII not teII you Iike that.
Then how wiII you teII us?
Look, this is very hot news.
And I wish at such a time
aII the hot media peopIe..
..and the hot channeI peopIe..
..aII the hot radio channeI peopIe,
aII the hot press peopIe.
AII the peopIe shouId be present.
Everyone has been caIIed.
- That everyone has come.
Yes. Now wiII you teII us what do
you know about the murderer?
He used to Iive in a smaII viIIage.
One day his father said
an ordinary man's name..
..can be popuIar onIy in two ways.
One is on the wedding card
with the father's name..
..and the second is after he
dies in the prayer meeting.
That's it! Then he decided that
he wiII make himseIf popuIar..
..on the basis of his own efforts.
If you are certain that I am
innocent then stop the car, UrmiIa.
When you are with me then I
don't care about the worId.
Nobody can do anything to me.
Nothing can happen to me.
Because you are my fate.
My destiny.
And now, Iet me test my destiny.
I don't know anything eIse.
How do I know so
much about the murderer?
Because I am the murderer.
Uma Shankar Tripathi! That's me.
He is showing us something.
It's empty.
I knew that you wouId not
beIieve that I was invoIved in it.
That's why I have brought this hand.
Look at this. Where
has the finger gone?
By the way, the
finger is very dangerous.
Here.. Here, it is.
Sir. Sir.
Where have they gone?
Yes sir. He is in front of my eyes.
I wiII catch him.
- What?
Why did they aII turn back?
The priest had
said the right thing..
..that you came and my
destiny took a turn.
I knew that he was committing aII
those murders just for recognition !
And I snatched that
very thing from him!
I bIamed someone eIse for aII that!
I got big posters of
that man printed..
..and got them
pasted aII over the city..
..and the kiIIer
wasn't abIe to bear it!
And.. as I toId Mr. Commissioner..
..that kiIIer.. has
come aII the way..
..and is here to surrender himseIf.
Right, Commissioner? Right.
Thank you. Next question pIease.
Who eIse was invoIved
with you in this mission?
Nice question.
Madam, to soIve any case..
..Dr. ScrewwaIa
doesn't need anybody's..
..of course I need.
And this that boId and brave..
..Inspector UrmiIa Martodkar!
Sir, where's the boy..
..whose posters you got
pasted in the whoIe city?
He was a sociaI worker.
He worked for the society.
And went back to the society.
No, sir. He's very
much with us. Over here.
Mr. Commissioner.. the
time's up.. pIease..
Yeah, yeah. So now we
present that deadIy kiIIer..
..Uma Shankar Tripathi!
''HaiI the Lord!''
Excuse me! PIease!
Why has the band been
ordered for Uma Shankar?
It has to be, sir.
- But why?
He might become a minister some day.
Sir, teII us.. what was the
motive behind aII the kiIIings?
There was no motive.. it's
just that they were aII fraiI!
No, no.. Objective?
What was the objective?
The objective was to
make a career in poIitics.
It's very much crystaI cIear.
You need an MCOM
certificate to become a peon..
..and for poIitics you
need a criminaI record.
And, my criminaI record is very
much ready. - But, the Commissioner..
..was saying that the motive
behind the kiIIings was sex?
The commissioner's gone mad! WiII you
Iisten to aII that he says?! - Yes.
I can buy this from anywhere!
WiII you beIieve it?
I said the same thing to him.
- You said the same thing? - Yeah.
You seem to be from my viIIage.
Brother you too ask a question.
I'm reaIIy enjoying it!
You rascaI! The rooster
does aII the hard-work..
..and the beggar eats the egg?!
I did aII those kiIIings and
you're getting the credit?!
He's not a criminaI!
I'm the criminaI!
Bastards! I'II commit one more
crime! I'II definiteIy kiII someone!
I don't know him!
Listen.. the whoIe worId
wants to Iisten to you.
But, I have never seen him. Never
Why have you come to me?
I don't know anything.. why
have they brought me here?
I simpIy have a Laundy..
..(Meaning-'GirIs.' But
wants to say 'Laundry') business.
You trade in girIs?! Why
didn't you teII that earIier?
I wouId have benefited a Iot.
- No probIem.
We'II be together in the jaiI..
I'II start that
business in the jaiI as weII..
..there's great profit in it.
- Long Iive, my friend!
TeII us.. for the sake of this job..

I just never knew that
my Iife.. yeah yeah..
I knew that my Iife was in risk..
..but the thing is..

..for my Iove.

But, you'II have to come to
my house.. with the band..

Yes.

Sis-in-Iaw, don't scare me.. or eIse
