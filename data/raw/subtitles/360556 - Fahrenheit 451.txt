Eels rioted last night
in Denver, demanding medicine,
travel permits
and full access to the 9.
Twelve Eels were arrested and
all the graffiti was found and burned.
Meanwhile, here in Ohio,
a warehouse full of graffiti
was found outside of Cleveland,
including a rare discovery
of pens and paper...
- Yuxie, MiPhotos.
- Here ya go, Montag.
Your fans are waiting on the 9.
Two firemen were sent
to the hospital with minor injuries.
Fire Commissioner Nyari
released a statement.
"Our elected officials will not allow
the happiness of our great state
"to be threatened by evil Eels.
"Our firemen will defend
our democracy."
Great choice.
You'll look good in those.
Now for the Happiness
Index, we go to Arthur Link.
You like that?
- There she blows.
- Yeah, Captain, yeah!
When you have a "why" to fight,
you can bear almost any "how."
I'll give you a "why."
You knocked my tooth out.
You're too pretty, anyway.
Let me see.
You can keep it that way.
Everything you lose
comes around in another form.
I'll get the doc
to print me up another one.
Eels are bad.
They're dangerous,
and they want chaos
in your hearts and your minds.
They want to make you unhappy.
Eels try to upload graffiti
to the Dark 9 before we can burn it.
What should these young Natives do,
Master Trooper?
Stay vivid on the 9.
If you see something, say something.
Eels say we limit information. Lies!
Master Trooper Montag, can you
read any book you want on the 9?
Sir, any book, sir.
Yuxie, show us some classics.
The Bible...
To the Lighthouse...
And Moby Dick.
This is all you need to know.
Anything else
will make you sick, crazy.
And that's why we're here.
To protect you,
and to keep you safe and happy.
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!
Please rise.
Happiness is truth!
Freedom is choice!
Self is strength!
Don't worry, these are for
training purposes only, okay?
Now, have any of you guys ever seen
one of these bad things for real?
No!
We burned almost every
physical book in the country.
So by the time you guys grow up,
there won't be one book left.
He should probably raise his hands
a little higher, right?
I might miss.
This is not a drill!
We've got Eels on the move!
- We got Eels slipping away! Move!
- Eels on the move! Let's ride!
Check all gear! Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! This is why we train!
Let's burn! Let's burn! Let's burn!
Down the red-hot valley, Io!
Down the red-hot valley, Io!
The phantom armies marching go
Salamander, ho!
Salamander, ho!
Ignite the tomes
and burn them bright
And feel the Salamander's bite
Feel the Salamander's bite
Salamander, ho!
Salamander, ho!
- Why we do burn?
- For happiness, ain't that right?
- Hell, yeah!
- Salamander!
Ho!
- Holy...
- Stone! Grab that hammer, baby!
Come on, let's go!
Kyle! Joe! Around back!
Have us a good
old-fashioned barbecue!
Captain wants some Eel soup!
Let's do it, boys!
Pipemen.
What do I upload? Wiki pages?
Shakespeare? Coltrane?
I gotta get to the servers.
Save what you can.
It's game time.
Y'all know what to do.
Freeze! Don't move!
Montag, upstairs.
I got him.
- Don't make me chase after you!
- Hold him down!
Everybody stay
right where you are!
Hey, drop the cord.
Come on. Yeah.
Come on.
You dream about hiding from me,
you better wake up and apologize.
- Hey, Captain, wanna come get some?
- Go check the other rooms.
Are you done?
What are you waiting for?
Waiting on you.
Good evening, Cleveland,
and welcome to tonight's fire show.
Captain Beatty
and his Master Trooper, Montag,
have uncovered Eels
pretending to be Natives.
What punishment would you like
to see here tonight?
Welcome, Natives, and everybody
at home watching on the 9.
Look what we found hiding
in your beautiful neighborhood.
Time to shove 'em out!
Eels don't deserve freedom,
now, do they?
- No!
- We won't let 'em take our jobs
and steal our tax money,
now, will we?
Hell, no! Self is strength!
Happiness is truth!
Guess what time it is?
Time to burn for America again!
- Come on.
- Wait, wait. No, no, no.
No, no, no. Wait.
Stone! Reprint.
- Yuxie, plus 10 years.
- Identity deletion commencing.
No!
Yeah.
Delete his identity!
- Ban his travel.
- Get that money, too.
Enjoy your new life as an Eel.
I'm not fire. I'm fire plus 100.
I'm molten lava on graffiti.
They call me a walking
incinerator for happiness.
Damn, it's a pleasure to burn!
Everybody watching at home on the 9,
are you ready?
Burn 'em, Montag!
Take that, Eels! Take that!
Hey. You're still high on kerosene,
aren't you?
I can smell it from here.
Let's get going.
- Where we headed?
- A little after-hours trip.
You hear from Major Curtis?
It's happening. End of the year.
- I knew it. "Major Beatty."
- Yeah.
I'm gonna miss
your ugly mug around here.
Yeah. You'll finally become me.
No. Not become you.
I'm gonna be
Captain motherfucking Montag.
There she is.
Don't worry,
I'll talk to her this time.
Keep your dick in your pants
and stand guard.
Well, well, well. Clarisse.
I hope you're not
wasting my time tonight.
Your last tip led me
to Boy Scouts with pornos.
Reactivate my fingers
like you said you would.
Feed me scraps,
and I'll delete your travel permit.
That's bullshit. You need me.
How many years
did we restrict you? Six?
After all the tips I gave you,
I should be free.
A beautiful, free rat.
Take a year off my sentence,
and I'll give you something you like.
Six months. But it better be good.
I didn't hear the Captain
say you could leave.
Yeah? How come he always makes you
wait outside like a little dog, huh?
You're just like Beatty.
I'm not like Beatty.
- Everyone has a master.
- Not me.
You spy on me,
but you never do anything.
- Why do I always make you nervous?
- You don't.
When I see you burning up Eels' lives,
you don't look nervous.
That's because I'm very good
at my job.
Have you ever thought,
even for one second,
why you do what you do?
You should try reading before burning.
See you around, Montag.
Hey.
Off limits.
Let's go. She recommended a spot.
Captain Beatty, I have
my permits, sir, all 100.
I can't wait to see 'em.
See if you can find me
a new pair of shoes.
Captain.
Well, look what I found.
You guys must think
you're pretty slick.
Sit down. Don't move.
Have they uploaded to the 9?
Nah. Just this monitor.
Hit "play." Do it.
Let's see what they have to say.
Before bots and the rise
of automated writing,
we had jobs forjournalists...
...someday.
She'd spend weeks, sometimes months,
investigating a story,
and then she'd publish
a series of articles...
...even thousands of words long,
on physical paper,
and the Internet, or the 9, today,
which everyone was free to read.
But nobody was reading anymore,
or they were just glancing
at the headlines
generated by an algorithm...
Thousands of words?
In your pathetic time,
were people happy?
No. There were so many
millions of opinions,
that our country slid
into the Second Civil War.
Eight million dead,
including my father.
Your father must have been old enough
to remember a time
when firemen put fires out
instead of starting them.
- Hey!
- You need to relax, all right?
Benjamin Franklin,
the founder of
our first fire department,
gave us the right to burn.
Those are lies.
Ben Franklin did not do that.
After the last
of your generation dies,
so will your words,
your memories,
and the burden of your fake past.
Even in their self-hours,
Captain Beatty and Master Trooper
Montag keep Cleveland safe.
Let's give them a plus-100 salute.
Do your part. See something,
say something. Tell Yuxie.
Meanwhile, firemen outside
of Buffalo, New York,
captured Eels attempting
to cross the border into Canada.
There has been an increase in illegal
migration, and local fire stations...
When you become Captain,
you have to know more.
You'll get to read more.
So you've read entire books?
Yeah, but the Ministry, of course,
they have complete works, right?
I don't know.
I suppose when they
make me District Major,
they'll throw me a few more scraps,
but the Ministry's...
How can we see anything
but the fire shadows in the cave,
if we're never allowed
to move our heads?
What does that mean?
Nothing.
You're as impatient as I was
when I was your age.
Yeah.
I just wonder how much my dad knew.
- He was a great fireman.
- Damn right he was.
- And a friend.
- Fucking Eels.
He was a hero.
- Same as you'll be, Guy Montag!
- I am a hero.
I am a hero.
Down the red-hot valley, Io
The phantom armies marching go
There we go!
Salamander, ho!
Salamander, ho!
Ignite the tomes and burn them...
...do things yourself!
Hear the Salamander cry!
Salamander, ho
Salamander, ho
It's a DD series.
It works.
I put in a new belt myself.
What do you have for me?
There is an abandoned house
out in the woods near Bedford.
It's a drop-off spot for graffiti.
- Does anyone live there?
- No, I don't think so.
Yuxie, firemen.
Did we use to put out fires?
That's a classic Eel lie.
And Benjamin Franklin?
Founder of our first fire department.
What's wrong, Montag?
Nothing.
Your vitals have been off recently.
I'm going to reconfigure your cocktail
and have new drops delivered.
That's fine.
John, have you used your drops today?
Yuxie, go dark.
I'm secure now.
Clarisse?
Haven't had milk in a week. Thanks.
Sorry, I couldn't find
any cooking oil.
- That's okay.
- Hey, Clarisse?
Be careful what you're selling.
People are talking.
Yuxie, go dark.
I'm secure now, Montag.
Signal lost.
Entering a black hole.
Set a transponder
so Raven can find us.
Transponder set.
Did Clarisse tell you about this spot?
Douglas.
Freeman, check around back.
Stone!
- Joel, Kyle, clear this room.
- Yes, sir.
Montag, get that
tumor Eel on her feet.
The rest of you, search the house now.
Yes, sir.
How many of you are there?
How many?
Grapes of Wrath. Hmm.
Get her up.
You heard the Captain.
Up, on your feet.
How many more of these do you have,
Ma Joad?
If you can read, you can talk.
"Play the man, Master Ridley.
"We shall this day
light such a candle, by God's grace,
"as I trust shall never be put out."
Captain Beatty.
You're never gonna believe
what we found, sir.
You gotta get up here.
Phelps, keep eyes on her.
This is gonna be
the most important burning
the country has ever seen, sir.
Go see if Raven followed
the transponder.
- But sir...
- You just heard the Captain.
Now move.
A regular, damn Tower of Babel.
I've only seen something like this
once in my career, when I was a cadet.
Have you ever seen
a physical book before?
Kafka.
A pornographer and a sexual pervert.
I like that about him.
Have you read that book?
Every fireman sooner or later
wants to know
what the Eels know,
what's in all this graffiti
that we burn.
You want to hold it?
Go on.
Before the men come back.
Open it.
Read.
Read.
Read.
Do you want to know
what's inside all these books?
Insanity.
The Eels want to measure their place
in the universe,
so they turn to these novels
about non-existent people.
Or worse, philosophers.
Look, here's Spinoza.
One expert screaming down
another expert's throat.
"We have free will."
"No, all of our actions
are predetermined."
Each one says the opposite,
and a man comes away lost,
feeling more bestial
and lonely than before.
Now, if you don't want
a person unhappy,
you don't give them two sides
of a question to worry about.
- Just give 'em one.
- Better yet, none.
See? Huck Finn
and his nigger friend.
The whites knew that you blacks
were offended, so what did we do?
We burned it.
And then Native Son came along,
and the whites didn't appreciate
that one all that much,
so they burned it, too.
Why didn't they like it?
Henry Miller, Hemingway.
The feminists don't approve,
so into the flames they go.
You see, we are not born equal, Guy,
so we must be made equal by the fire,
and then, we can be happy.
So, we burn.
Well, let's clear all this filth
out of here
and get the fire show started with.
Shall we?
But take one last look.
You may never see
anything like this again.
Your grandchildren won't even
understand what a book is.
Can you tell us anything
about what's inside?
Nothing that can't burn
at 451 degrees.
And there you have it...
Montag, let's get her out of here.
Come on.
Let's go.
Lady, this whole house
is gonna get torched.
And me, with my books.
- Let's go.
- Montag, never mind.
Just get over here, please.
Captain, are we just gonna leave her?
Get over here now.
Look, miss, you can do what you like,
but you know as well as I do
these books are gonna burn.
No.
Omnis.
Omnis.
The Ministry has wiped out
the word "Omnis" from across the 9.
This coward is not
going to become a martyr
before we find out
what the hell she's shouting about.
Captain Beatty,
perhaps you can explain
why you let this Eel start a bonfire?
We didn't know she had a match, sir,
and the kerosene...
Major Curtis spoke highly of you.
I hope I can come to understand why.
After "Beatty's Barbecue,"
our team reported the word "Omnis"
appearing in unusually
high numbers on the Dark 9.
If an Eel is going
to blow herself up for it,
we need to get ahead of it.
This is the first
self-fire in Ohio's history,
and only the fourth in the nation.
This marks a new low in Eel actions
threatening our happiness.
Details about this tumor Eel
are coming in.
She lived alone in the woods,
without Yuxie, like a wild animal,
and suffered from
a plus-100 mental illness.
A result of extreme exposure
to reading graffiti.
Coward.
We will be updating you
as more details come in.
- You all right?
- Always.
Life of a Master Trooper, huh.
Montag.
You hesitated tonight
in front of the men.
I know.
But it won't happen again.
You know, it's my first time
seeing a self-burn, too.
But as far as I'm concerned,
it just proves
we're doing the right thing.
What was that old lady talking about?
"Master Ridley, play..."
Something.
Well, back when people
still believed in Gods,
the Brits burned alive
two Eels at the stake,
Ridley and Latimer,
for praying to a different book
than their queen did.
Before us,
people committed genocides over books,
while others blew themselves up,
killing innocent people.
Insanity plus 100.
But why did she burn herself
for books?
Well, she tried to burn us all,
don't you think?
She didn't say "coward."
She said "Omnis." What is that?
Well, the Commissioner won't say
what the Ministry knows,
but I guess
we're gonna have to find out.
Burn me.
- John.
- Go ahead.
Hurry up. I won't ask twice.
I know you're different
than the other men.
I watched you grow up,
and that's how I know
you feel the same inside as me.
Closer.
I've been burned so many times,
I don't know where my scars end
and my body begins.
There's no way you're gonna break.
You're the youngest cadet
I ever accepted
into the Youth Fire Brigade.
I raised you.
And one day
you'll be just like me, son.
You won't feel anything
when they burn you.
Yuxie, go dark, please.
I'm secure now, Montag.
"I am a sick man.
"I am a wicked man.
"An unattractive man.
"I think my liver hurts."
"I agree that 'two times two is four'
"is an excellent thing.
"But 'two times two is five'
"is sometimes also
a most charming, little thing."
- False.
- Yuxie, I said go dark.
We are dark.
It's just me and you.
But that is false.
Two times two can only be four.
What are you doing, Montag?
Are you feeling okay?
Where are you going?
I don't think that old woman
killed herself.
I think they staged it.
It's all fake.
Didn't even bother to sync her lips
this time. You saw that shit, right?
Yeah, they definitely murdered her.
Why do you keep pounding away at it?
Hey. Are you good?
Clarisse, you know what
we're working on.
We need someone with your connections.
So you tell me when you're ready
to come back to us.
See you later.
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Hey!
- Did Beatty send you?
- No, I just came to talk.
What do you want?
I want to know who that old woman was.
I don't know.
She lit herself on fire, for books.
- Why?
- What do you care?
Because I can still smell her burning.
You did that.
And you told us
exactly where to find her.
She didn't say "coward."
She said "Omnis."
What is that?
I don't know.
I just want to show you something.
I took it from her house.
Is this a trap, pipeman?
If anybody sees me with this...
I'm dead.
Hey, Clarisse.
Yeah?
- She didn't see who you were.
- I shouldn't be here.
Then leave.
Please don't do that.
Can you read that out loud?
Please?
"Even if man were nothing
but a piano key,
"even if this were proved to him
by natural science and mathematics,
"even then, he will invent
destruction and chaos.
"He will invent all kinds of suffering
out of ingratitude,
"simply to convince himself
that he is a man
"and not a piano key."
Hard to understand, right?
The Ministry has been
wiping away language
in order to wipe away thought.
There used to be 6,000 languages
in the world.
Today there are fewer than 60.
Why do you think the Ministry
wants to create
one universal language on the 9?
For the connection and happiness
of all Natives.
During the Second Civil War,
the old tech companies
developed systems to predict
our thoughts.
Then they became the Ministry,
or the Ministryjoined them.
Then they sold us what we wanted.
Self and happiness.
Which the 9 provides in spades
and what we hired you to defend,
with fire.
You're telling me people
wanted it this way?
The Ministry didn't do this to us.
We did it to ourselves.
We demanded a world like this.
Let me ask you something.
Benjamin Franklin, did he
start the first fire department?
Yeah, but to put fires out,
not to start them.
- Beatty told me the opposite.
- I know exactly what Beatty told you.
Maybe he believes that.
Maybe he's lying to you.
Maybe when Beatty was a young cadet,
his fire captain lied to him.
Do you have trouble with memory?
Take a lot of drops?
What about you?
Can you remember your past?
Some.
Are you hungry?
I don't have much.
How about your parents?
Can you remember them?
I was raised by Eels to be an Eel,
pretending to be a Native.
We read books, watched films...
Everything you burn.
By the time I was a teen,
I wanted to be normal, like you.
So, I ran away from home.
Got hooked on the 9,
the drops, everything.
I was happy for a while.
But then, you know, life.
Men.
I was broke,
so I started selling graffiti.
Didn't know that old woman
would be there.
I had never thought about the people
behind the things that I burn.
I mean, they must have spent
their entire life making things.
And here I come, in two seconds...
It's gone.
I want to show you something.
Try.
Come on.
Like this?
Here.
Put this hand here on top.
Yeah, that's it. Try it.
All the details surrounding the Omnis
are classified,
but the Ministry will include
the public to help smoke it out.
The danger is real and immediate.
Washington's watching us, boys.
I want your cities to burn so hot,
the Commander-in-Chief
can roast marshmallows
all the way from the White House.
Make it rain kerosene.
DNA.
The genetic information
found inside all living organisms.
The Eels have converted
the language of technology
into the language of DNA.
They've figured out a way
to insert enough graffiti
into this microscopic speck of DNA
to bury the Earth 10 times over.
The Omnis is the collective
consciousness of mankind.
It will be every book, painting,
music, film,
all of history,
everything on the savages'
Internet of old.
News, memoirs, facts.
It will be a trillion
person-years of graffiti,
all inside
this microscopic strand of DNA.
Now, the Ministry believes
it is here in Ohio,
and in transit to scientists
in Canada.
We have to find it
before it crosses the border.
Captain, if they succeed,
how will we stop it?
If the Omnis is unleashed,
there will be no way to stop it.
All of humanity's chaotic knowledge
will burst forth,
like mosquitoes spreading malaria.
And the dark countries will take over.
Even the greatest army of firemen
will seem like spitting babies
before the Omnis.
And everything our parents,
our grandparents,
sacrificed in the Second Civil War
will be lost.
We will not let that happen.
We will burn down the city tonight,
gentlemen!
- Salamander!
- Ho!
Eels on the move!
Eels on the move!
This is why we burn!
If any of you know where the Omnis is
and don't talk,
your lives will be burned!
Breaking news.
There is a new threat
to our nation's happiness,
the Omnis.
The Ministry has not revealed details,
but fire divisions across
Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Ohio
are conducting raids,
searching for this new evil.
Get him! Get him!
"Omnis." What's that mean to you?
What's that mean to you?
You're not doing yourselves
any favors.
Tell me where the Omnis is!
Death to fire! Real liberty unite!
Come here!
Slippery, little Eel.
In the truck!
They try to say
there's no evidence danger exists.
Well, then show me the evidence
danger doesn't exist.
The truth is, this danger is real,
the threat is real.
Omnis is real.
Death to fire!
"To be sure, I myselfjust
made up all these words of yours.
"This, too, is from underground.
"I've spent 40 years on end there,
"listening to these words
of yours through a crack.
"I thought them up myself,
"since this was all
that would get thought up."
I will have you all down on
this street before the night is over!
Consequences of silence
will be severe!
Help yourselves and your neighbors
by telling us what you know!
Not tomorrow, not the next day,
but now!
"At least I myself
have only recently resolved
"to recall some
of my former adventures,
"which, till now,
I have always avoided.
"Can it be that you are
indeed so gullible
"to imagine I will publish this all?
"And, what's more,
give it to you to read?
"Now I want precisely
to make a test.
"Is it possible to...
"Is it possible to be perfectly
candid with oneself
"and not be afraid
"of the whole truth?"
One of you Eels must know
something about the Omnis.
What if I tell
these people what you do?
What would be worse?
What I do to you,
or what they do to you?
We're all the same here.
Whatever you do to her, you do to us.
Is that so?
Fair enough.
I am your judge, and I am your court.
I receive you when you come,
and I dismiss you when you go!
- Round 'em up!
- Get over here.
Round 'em up.
Over there! Round 'em up.
Get down! Stay down!
Come on. Come here.
The Ministry
has placed the nation
in a plus-100 state of security
until the Omnis is found.
Youth Cadets have been
recruited to patrol borders
and search all transit hubs.
Do your duty.
Stay vivid on the 9
and report all suspicious activity.
- What are you doing?
- I have to get out of here.
Where are you gonna go?
There are people hiding out
at a compound my family used to know.
Maybe I can help them.
They've got checkpoints
all over the place.
You think you can make it?
I have a friend who knows
where they are.
I think he can help me.
Will I see you again?
Keep searching for that Omnis!
- Get 'em out of here.
- Yes, sir.
All clear. Let's check upstairs.
And how would you explain
your behavior today?
I fucked up.
- I couldn't tell you why.
- Was it the kid?
Eels use kids as decoys all the time.
No excuse. I know my actions
put you and the men in danger.
What if they had had the Omnis?
Captain Beatty...
Sir, it's been a true honor.
But...
I respectfully ask
that you accept my resignation.
- Get that off my desk.
- I'm sorry, John.
Do it. Now.
Are you serious?
I just submitted your name
to replace me as captain.
- It's not about that.
- So you're willing to throw away
the 16 years
that I've invested in you?
I have 16 years
of the Ministry's shit in my head.
And I want to know why we burn.
I want to decide.
- So you want to prove you exist?
- Yeah, I do.
I got things inside my head
that don't make sense.
Dreams about my dad.
Look, as your commanding officer,
it is my duty to report you
for letting two Eels go free today.
And if I do that,
you will be tried for treason.
And there will be
nothing I can do to protect you.
You betray me,
and I will burn you.
And then I will burn your ashes.
Dreams are a terror, son. I know.
But it's just your mind
flinging itself to pieces.
Just stand back
from the centrifuge, okay?
You have a virus.
Go home and rest.
Take a hot bath.
And then you report to work tomorrow.
But don't make me come get you.
Reactivate.
Hello, John.
Yuxie, get me Fireman Douglas.
WOMAN Do your part.
See something, say something.
Tell Yuxie.
Together, we will keep Cleveland...
Montag, get in.
How'd you find me?
- My friend Gustavo...
- I'm no friend of his.
Don't look at me.
- Don't fucking look at me!
- Stop!
- What's wrong with you?
- You deleted my brother's life, man!
And you gave him 25 years!
You're scum!
That's enough.
You better be right about him.
Where we going?
To those people at the compound
I told you about.
- They want to see you.
- For what?
- Something about the Omnis.
- Do it, or I will.
You have to put this on.
Who else was with him?
I don't know, sir.
Axis-Cam picked up Clarisse.
I knew Montag was a rat.
I told you he wasn't pure.
I didn't ask your opinion!
And the next time
I tell you to follow someone,
you crawl into their asshole!
You hear me?
Report back to the station.
Yes, sir.
This is a problem, John.
Clarisse told us you stole this.
But when I see you sitting there,
all I can see is fire.
You must be burning all these books,
and us, in your mind.
Because you are what you are,
and perhaps,
that's all you'll ever be... Fire.
This man is just like
his commandant, Beatty.
He's not to be trusted.
Why did you burn books
your whole life?
Because that's all I know.
This man is a stuk stront.
But I want to do something else.
Why?
When I look at that book,
it made me remember when I was a kid.
Just sitting by the ocean,
and I was trying to fill
this sieve with sand.
But the faster I poured,
the faster the sand fell through it.
Looking at the words in that book,
I felt like they...
They were passing right through me.
Like my whole life just
passed right through me.
And that I missed it.
I'm not gonna let that happen again.
Books are here to remind us
what fools we can be.
But if we can remember,
if the Omnis can spread,
then maybe we will win.
The disconnected human mind
is the last bastion
against the technological world.
It's the most secure place
to preserve these books.
We're totally off the grid.
No computers, no way
for you firemen to track us
or enter our dreams.
Everything safely here.
You memorized all these books?
We each memorize one,
and then we become the book.
I am Toni Morrison, Song of Solomon.
He's The Letters of Van Gogh.
She's Chairman Mao,
The Little Red Book.
She's Rumi, Darwin, Anna Karenina.
And she's Half of a Yellow Sun.
She's still memorizing it.
In fact, you've met one of us already.
You took this book from her library.
She was John Steinbeck's
The Grapes of Wrath,
now lost to humanity forever.
But maybe from her death
we will gain something.
We haven't seen Clarisse
since she was a teen,
when she was here with her parents.
I believe you were memorizing
White Teeth.
And she tells us you want to help.
We have an important task for you
related to the Omnis.
But we have to be sure about you.
Do you know this man?
Fireman Hester, Fourth District.
That's right. He's in the back room,
waiting for you.
And you're gonna have to kill him.
You never told me that.
He's through that door.
A revolution is not a dinner party.
Good luck.
I need you, I need you.
Stop! Put it down!
- Hey, man, what the fuck is this?
- You did it.
It's over.
I'm James Baldwin.
The Fire Next Time. Welcome.
This way, please.
There's a young man, Clifford,
in this barn,
in transit to a group of scientists
in Canada,
and we need you to escort him
over the border.
His mother was a geneticist
behind the Omnis.
Before she died, she injected the DNA
into Clifford's pet bird.
- The Omnis is in a bird?
- Yes.
We need you
to get them both to safety.
Clifford? There's a man here
to see you.
Eight. Tagore, Gitanjali,
and poems by Tagore.
It's number eight.
Has he read all these books?
He's memorized
over 13,000 books.
Pick up a book and test me.
I won't look. But you'll never win.
Read the title.
- Remembrance of Things...
- Remembrance of Things Past.
Marcel Proust, 1927.
Three thousand thirty-one pages,
seven volumes, 1,267,069 words.
Open it.
Open it.
Page number... I'll turn around.
No cheating. Page number?
- Page 935.
- 935.
Line 12. Go to line 12.
"So, as long as you distract
your mind from its dreams,
"it will not know them
for what they are.
"You will always be taken in
by the appearance of things,
"because you will not have
grasped their true nature.
"If dreaming is dangerous,
"then the cure for it
is not to dream less,
"but to dream more,
to dream all the time."
Again. Test me again. You'll lose.
Can I show him Lennie?
- Can I?
- Yes.
Hey. This is Lennie.
My sturnidae, from the Latin sturnus.
Medium-sized passerine.
Very gregarious.
Very beautiful.
This is my Lennie.
What's up, Lennie?
- So, what's the next step?
- We need a transponder.
The scientists in Canada
are transmitting a homing signal
that will call to a transponder.
Can you get one
and come back tonight?
Yes.
What are they gonna
do with the bird?
They're waiting to extract
the DNA with the Omnis,
duplicate it,
and then inject all other animals
so that knowledge
can spread and multiply.
And cover the world.
You'd better hurry.
Master Trooper.
I wasn't expecting to see you.
- Are you over your sickness?
- Yeah.
You were right. I just needed to rest.
- I'm feeling 100 now.
- Beautiful.
- So you're with us?
- Yes, sir.
We need to find the Omnis. Any leads?
Yuxie, have Fireman Douglas
and his squad report.
Ready time. I'm ready to gear up.
What does two times two equal?
Excuse me?
Four.
Why? What's wrong?
Is that all you have to say to me?
Of course. John, just talk to me.
What's going on?
I, too, burn with desire.
But I would rather walk
with my brother in the darkness,
than go alone in the light.
- Sir.
- Whatever happens tonight, Guy,
you should know,
I would rather walk with my brother.
Douglas, report, please.
Found this in the locker room, sir.
Whose locker did you find it in?
- Nobody's. It was just on the floor.
- Like a dead rat.
Take it. That's an order.
Go on. Read us a bedtime story.
Let's burn this shit.
No, no, no, no. A special tip came
directly to me tonight.
Might be a good lead on the Omnis.
But let's finish
this little business first.
Open the book.
Oh, my. Your pulse is really racing.
Steady now, Montag.
I wouldn't want to burn your hand off.
Now read. Read to me.
"To go wrong in one's own way,
"is better than to go right
in someone else's.
"Taking a new step,
uttering a new word,
"is what people fear the most."
All those silly words,
those false promises,
the timeworn philosophies.
It's like chain-smoking,
chapter by chapter.
- Go on. Don't stop reading to me.
- Sir.
Next page!
"Did you think that one tiny crime
"would be wiped out
by thousands of good deeds?
"That there would be no punishment?"
A little knowledge
is a dangerous thing.
You read a few lines,
and you're ready to blow up the world,
chop heads off, destroy authority.
I know. I've been through it all.
Now, what do you want to do?
I want to burn.
Montag.
My brother.
Let's burn.
Good evening, Cleveland.
Live outside
Master Trooper Montag's home,
where shocking events are unfolding.
Montag! Do you have anything
to say to your fans?
Montag?
Something the matter, Montag?
You wanted to fly near the sun.
You burn your damn wings off
and you wonder why.
Go in. I'll give you a minute
to get your house in order.
Go on.
No one is looking out
for you now, boy.
Hello, Montag.
This is rather unfortunate.
Some people would like to see you.
That's quite a collection of graffiti
you have there.
Your fans deserve an explanation.
These aren't mine.
You set me up!
Welcome, John.
I've been waiting for you.
Yuxie, go dark.
I told you I would burn you
if you betrayed me.
And this...
This is the big dance.
Douglas. Stone.
Yuxie! Let the fire show begin.
Now, you do what
you are trained to do.
All you know how to do.
Burn.
You're not finished. Go on.
Free yourself.
Let's light him up.
Tell your fans what time it is.
It's time to burn
for America again!
Say it, Montag.
- Say it!
- Spit it out!
Come on, Captain.
Why did you do this?
What did you find? Chaos?
The Salamander eats its own tail.
Master Trooper Douglas.
Master Trooper Douglas reporting, sir.
Tell us what you saw.
Montag getting into a car with
Clarisse McClellan and two known Eels.
No wonder you've been
so eloquent lately.
But you're still
the same dog I raised.
Just barking
at someone else's command.
Gather a squad, find Clarisse and
the other Eels and bring them to me.
Yes, sir.
- Montag! Stop it! Let go! Drop it!
- Drop it, Douglas!
Well, that's one way
to win your fans back.
- Hold fire till your brother speaks.
- Drop it, Douglas.
Go ahead, pull the trigger,
let Douglas have it.
- Captain...
- Quiet, Douglas!
Could it be existence is our exile
and nothingness is our home?
Fire is your home, Montag.
Burn away.
No, Captain, please!
What is called "a reason for living"
is also an excellent reason for dying.
Montag, you did it.
You did it.
Choice.
Dear Natives,
Eel Montag, murderer Montag,
terrorist Montag
has committed treason
against our nation.
Eyes on Axis-Cam, eyes on the 9,
and report where this terrorist is.
Terrorist Montag,
could he have the Omnis?
Stay vivid to find out.
- Where's Gustavo?
- They arrested him.
Transponder?
- Page 93.
- 93.
"I bequeath myself to the dirt,
"to grow from the grass I love.
"If you want me again,
look for me under your boot soles.
"You will hardly know who I am
or what I mean,
"but I shall be good health
to you nevertheless,
"and filter and fiber your blood.
"Failing to fetch me at first,
keep encouraged.
"Missing me one place, search another.
"I stop somewhere, waiting for you."
Found him. He's heading
to this black hole outside Talay City.
Rerouting for fastest arrival.
Clifford, run!
Hey, look at me!
Get out of here!
Run! Run!
- Toni!
- Don't you move!
- Get down!
- Get off of her!
- Get over...
- Run!
Come on. Get up, we gotta go.
Come on.
Stand still!
When I ask you not to move,
that means don't move!
Hey, Clifford.
Omnis?
Stop.
I command you, Montag.
Stop.
