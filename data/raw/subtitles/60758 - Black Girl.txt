BLACK GIRL
Will someone be waiting for me?
You made it all right? Let's go!
Have a nice crossing?Yes, sir.
Lovely country, France!
Yes, sir.
Here we are at last!
Is that you?
Hello, Diouana.
I hope you'll like it here.
I'll show you your room.
That's your bed.
And that's the Riviera...
Juan-les-Pins, Nice...
Cannes...
Antibes.
Now let's go see the kitchen.
The kitchen, the bathroom...
the bedroom, the living room.
That's all I do!
That's not what I came to France for!
What are the people here like?
The doors are all shut, day and night!
Night and day!
I came to take care of children!
Where are they?
Why does the mistress always shout at me!
I'm not a cook! I'm not a cleaning-woman!
You're not going to a party!
You've been dressed like that for three weeks!
I bought this apron for you.
Let's see...
Turn around...
We're having guests for lunch.
maafe：大概是用花生酱西红柿等煮的炖肉酱
Make us rice with maafe.
Why this apron?
What am I in this house?
I was never a cook!
Why does the mistress want rice?
In Dakar, her cook never made rice!
Maybe the rice isn't the same in Dakar...
I'm here for children. Where are they?
Why did the mistress send for me if they aren't with her?
After this rice maybe they'll show me the city.
Maybe we'll go to Cannes...
Nice, Monte Carlo.
We'll look at all the pretty stores...
and when the mistress pays me...
I'll buy pretty dresses,
shoes,
silk undies
and pretty wigs.
And I'll get my picture taken...
and I'll send it back to Dakar... and they'll all die of jealousy!
I hope they like my rice...
My sauce isn't too spicy...
What if the children don't come?
I'm dying to taste it!
You'll see, it's good but very spicy!
Genuine African cooking!
Prepared by the maid!
Could you pass me the rice?
Yes.
You like it?
Yes, it's very good!
Very spicy!
I like spicy food! I'm in luck!
Diouana.
A plate of rice and wine.
They eat like pigs and jabber away!
These people!
And do they drink!
A little sauce...
It's good!
A bit more...
You must come to Dakar!
Africa isn't safe now, all those civil wars.
Senegal is safe.
Yeah, that 's pretty good.
Delicious.
And well-prepared! Your cook's a gem!
Africans only eat rice.
Just what is maafe?
Is it fattening?
I hope it's aphrodisiac!
Always kidding!
Thank you, Diouana.
Do you mind, Miss?
I've never kissed a black woman.
I've got a feeling she's angry.
Their independence has made them less natural.
He was just joking!
Your rice was fine! I'm proud of you!
Make us some good coffee!
Put that down.
Come here!
"Public letter-writer".
Where are you going?
To look for work.
It all began that morning...
in Dakar.
I went up and down the stairs...
from one floor to the next.
It was the same all over:
Nobody wanted a maid.
Think of the future!
For me, the future is black!
A man can't have opinions any more!
That's obstruction!
That 's what you say!
Speak for his own interest.
In your district...
I'm elected by the people!
Not so loud!
Why not? I say "no"!
Think of your family!
Children!
He's right, you have to ease off a bit.
Excuse me...
No! I don't want any!
He picked me up... All he did was look at me.
My mind was elsewhere:
I had to have work.
The street was empty except for 2 women...
They were lovely... I watched them go by.
But he kept on talking.
He told me about the square... where maids wait for work.
When we got there, he left me.
I promised to see him again.
And like the other girls... I sat on the curb to wait.
The sun passed over us several times...
but we all came back every morning and evening.
That morning... I went to the square as usual.
The others were there...
and I sat down on the curb...
as I did every day, to wait for destiny.
She came up from behind...
She passed us in review.
No one could see her eyes.
She looked us over one at a time.
We saw she was looking for a maid.
They rushed her.
Each wanted to be chosen.
The lady backed away...
from all those reaching hands.
I was getting up when the lady came towards me...
and asked me if I wanted a job.
"Yes ma'am."
"Can you care for children?"
"Yes, ma'am."
"You've worked for white folks?"
"No, ma'am."
She hired me anyway. I was happy.
I had a job! When I went home that evening...
I was very, very happy!
I've got a job!
I've got a job!
I've got a job with white folks!
I've got a job with white folks!
I've got a job!
a job!
a job with white folks!
I've got a job!
a job with white folks!
As usual, mother was there.
And I told her about my job.
Mother threw down the mask and told me to be brave.
Give me the mask and I'll give you 50 francs on pay day.
It's for me?
Yes, ma'am.
A present from the maid.
Looks like the real thing!
This is the new nursery maid.
Tell her the house rules:
What she breaks, she pays for.
Give her something to eat.
Yes, Ma 'am.
These are the children:
Sophie...
Damien...
and Philip.
Now go play outside.
In Dakar, I didn't do the cooking...
or the laundry.
I only cared for the children.
I took them for walks...
took them to school...
and brought them home again.
I'm not so sure!
In Senegal...
With Senghor, it is.
I'll have to think it over.
It's a golden opportunity!
But all those civil wars! I'm a family man!
From a distance, it seems worse that it is.
But look at the Congo!
Senegal isn't the Congo! And life is easy there.
How long before I'd get back to France?
You get leave every two years. And there's no risk:
Part of your salary is paid in France.
It sounds interesting...
What about housing?
Everything is taken care of.
You'd have no worries.
Here 's the coffee.
Does she speak French?
No...
She understands...
Instinctively?
I suppose so.
Like an animal!
Anyway, she cooks well.
It's time for us to go.
You must come to Dakar!
Now I understand.
The mistress wanted a housemaid.
That's why she picked me!
Why am I here?
Am I a nursery maid or a housemaid?
Diouana seems strange.
No.
Look!
She seems to be wasting away.
Maybe it's the climate.
What about the climate? She's lazy, that's all.
The children will be back soon...
We have to think about it.
Excuse me, I'm going to take a nap.
Yes, you'd better. And I won't cut short my vacation!
I'm fed up with this life!
All you do is drink!
You need to stop when the kids come!
I'm going for a walk.
She wasn't like that in Dakar.
Neither was he...
When the children come...
Who'll do the cooking and washing?
Back in Dakar they must be saying:
"Diouana is happy in France...
She has a good life."
For me, France is the kitchen...
the living room, the bathroom and my bedroom.
Where are the people who live in this country?
The mistress told me:
"You'll see, Diouana, there are lovely shops in France."
Is France that black hole?
What am I here?
The cook?
The cleaning woman?
The washerwoman?
And when the kids come, what else will I have to do?
I'm alone.
Did the mistress bring me here to shut me in?
That's why she was so nice to me in Dakar...
giving me her old dresses...
her old slips...
her old shoes.
I spend my life between the kitchen and my bedroom.
Is that living in France?
Diouana, wake up!
Get up, lazy-bones!
Will you get up?
We're not in Africa!
Get up!
We 're not in Africa.
I didn't hire you to sleep! The children are here!
Diouana, come out of there!
I know you've finished!
Diouana! Get out!
Get out of there!
What's going on?
Get out of the bathroom.
Diouana won't come out!
I had to make coffee myself! She's useless!
Soon I'll be the maid here!
Hello, son.
Good morning, daddy.
Get dressed.
Perhaps a rest would do her good... She needs one.
What for?
She could visit the town.
She knows no one here but the grocer...
And I'm responsible for her.
Philip, go play outside.
Watch out for the window!
Take those off! Don't forget you're a maid!
The kids are here, the picnic's over!
Diouana, are you ill?
No, ma'am.
Then what is it?
If you don't work, you won't eat.
If I don't eat, I don't take care of the children.
News from Dakar...
Diouana, there's a letter for you.
It's from Dakar.
Shall I read it?
Yes.
It's from your mother.
"My dear daughter...
Diouana, I am your mother, I write this letter.
I've had no news since you left.
Thanks to Atif Correa, got the address from your boss.
My health is getting worse every day.
Why do you leave me penniless?
I've nothing to live on while you have fun in France.
Squander your wages.
I know you can't write.
But I'm sure your mistress will do it,
Because she is a great woman
And a mother,
and gave you her cast-off clothes
She'll write for you.
You mustn't think only of yourself.
You've sent nothing since you left
Even if you have a salary.
What did you do with the money?
Think of me, think of your mother
Who has to pay for even water and who is so poor.
I think of you and pray for you and your employers.
Your mother."
Well, we're going to reply.
I hope this will help!
"Dear mamma,
I received your letter..."
Now what do you want to say?
Diouana, tell me what to write.
Well, I 'm gonna continue. Stop me if you don't agree.
"Dear Mamma, I received your letter.
I'm in good health and I think of you.
My mistress didn't have time to write for me..."
That's not true. And it's not my letter. Not more.
My mother didn't write it.
And I didn't ask him to write a letter for me.
And my mistress is no lady.
It's because I can't write.
If I could write, I'd tell all about my mistress' "kindness".
I'm a prisoner here.
She's mad! After all, it's her mother!
I'm their prisoner.
I don't know anyone here.
No one in my family is here.
That's why I'm their slave.
Go play with Diouana.
Let's go.
Diouana, we're going to play! Papa and mamma have gone out.
This mask is mine.
The mistress deceived me. Let her take care of her son.
You won't give me something to eat. So take care of your son by yourself.
Can I come in?
Diouana, when will my brother and sister be back?
I don't know!
I haven't eaten, I won't work.
I'm not my mistress' plaything.
They're fighting again!
That's life in France.
Why did I want to come to France?
The mistress had given me a dress and a suitcase...
and we went for a walk through the city.
All I could think of was the trip ahead.
We had a photo taken.
We argue, because he made a gesture that I did not like.
I broke off.
All I could think of was my trip:
I was going to France!
You think France is prettier than this?
How do I know? I've never been there.
My mistress asked me to go with her.
What for?
For the children.
He's angry. He's going to say:
"That's domestic slavery!"
My mother has agreed, I'll go to France.
To France! To France!
FOR OUR DEAD A GRATEFUL NATION
Come down!
It's a sacrilege!
Will you come down!
Don't stay up there!
You hear me?
Run!
Jump!
Come on, I'll take you to France!
Just think!
What about?
I'm going to France with my mistress.
What will you do there?
I'll visit the country.
Why is he sulking?
I'm in his room. What more does he want?
I've got to go to France.
I promised my mistress.
She didn't do the dishes.
Where can she be?
How should I know?
Sleeping again!
On your feet!
Where's the mask?
Are you ill?
No.
Do you want your money?
Here's 20,000 francs.
What's wrong?
I don't know. Let her be.
Why, there's the mask!
It's mine!
Let go!
It's mine!
You sent off the mask.
Help!
She's out of her mind!
What's going on?
She took down the mask.
But it's hers, she gave it to you!
The ungrateful wench! After all I've done for her!
This mask is mine.
I bought it for 50 francs.
Never again will the mistress scold me.
Never again will she say: "Diouana, make coffee."
Never again: "Diouana, make rice."
Never again: "Diouana, take off your shoes."
Never again: "Diouana, wash this shirt."
Never again: "Diouana, you're lazy."
Never will I be a slave.
I did not come here for the apron...
or the money.
Never will she see me again.
Never will she scold me again.
Never again Diouana.
Never will I see them again.
The mistress lied.
She's always lied.
She'll not lie to me again.
Never will she lie to me again.
She wanted to keep me here as her slave.

We're going back to Dakar.
Her housecoat.
Follow me.
This is Diouana's boss.
Come with me.
This way.
Mother, this is Diouana's boss.
Mister, this is Diouana's mother.
It's for you.
Here...
Take it! It's for you!
Take it!
She doesn't want it. Keep your money.
