What happened?
Wake Jayram and Mohini.
Tell them to get ready.
And Sriram? Find out. Where is he?
Daddy's calling...
Seven missed calls! Dad is going to
hold on to this for the next 7 lives.
Sorry, my phone was on silent mode.
That's why we've
been trying to call you.
We are all going to her house now.
I suggest you come there directly.
Immediately!
You know my friend Rajat? The fat one?
He met with an accident on
Ring Road and broke his hip.
I need to rush to the hospital.
Please don't say you won't be coming...
I'll come.
For the funeral.
Black Sheep!
You're the Black sheep of the family!
I look 'black' to you?
I'll come for the memorial service.
...and I'll have my memorial service.
And guarantee you'll miss that as well!
There are others
besides you in this world.
Don't you need to
fulﬁll your duty towards them?
What can I do for the country?
The grandson of a Gandhian
freedom ﬁghter speaks thus.
Your grandfather was my inspiration.
Jayram considers me his idol.
For Chinnu, Jayram is a hero!
ls there anyone for whom you are a hero?
Send you to America to study
and you return an alien...
You don't look a part
of this family anymore.
NO SON.
This time I won't support you.
You've become extremely self-centred.
Your aunt called from Chennai 8 times...
All she wanted was to know
whether you liked her sweater.
You didn't use the sweater...
...but you didn't even say "Thank you."
Where is that sweater?
Where is the sweater?
Muttu considers me a hero!
To hope for anything
from this boy is like...
There's only one
solution to straighten this boy.
Even a small thing is
valuable for the country.
He was switched at the hospital.
Mom will see the sitar
and agree immediately.
She has two!
Your smile...
Can I be honest?
I have no interest in getting married.
I was going to reject you... but...
Then do it!
Our family is exactly like yours...
I'm in love with someone else.
But I can't say no to
this proposal. So, please...
They're calling you outside.
Come on!
Such a small world, right son?
In the 1946 freedom struggle,
your grandfather...
...and Mr. Natarajan's father
were both in Hyderabad Jail.
If I would have refused, dad
would throw me out of the company.
And anyways, why should I
care about Vasudha's problem?
What say, Sandy?
Plus, she's beautiful,
Tamilian, from a good family.
Mom and Dad are love-struck.
A prize catch like this makes
everything fall into place. Right?
Everything3 vegetarian?
Why are you doing this?
Everything3 vegetarian!
Don't tell the family but
I'm a strict chicketarian.
Sriram, I'm very serious about him.
Then why tell me? Tell your parents.
They will never accept Kamal.
Kamal Haasan? The actor?
Kamal doesn't have his
own place nor a stable job.
He's an environmentalist. Like...
You mean a social servant?
Vasudha you've been saved.
I promise you, you've been saved!
These people are really dangerous.
They're crazy.
I used to date one such girl.
It was quite serious but...
Don't tell me that in today's day
you thought you'll ﬁnd a guy
who hasn't had a girlfriend.
How many girlfriends did you have?
Mar“!-
But this one was special.
Less of Environment.
More of a mentalist!
The government has said
you can't defecate here...
...because there aren't any toilets.
Sol said, "Who needs a toilet?"
Since we're fasting, what
will we possibly excrete?
Whatever it is, get rid of Corruption!
We're done with Corruption!
Get rid of Corruption!
We're done with Corruption!
Get rid of Corruption!
We're done with Corruption!
Get rid of Corruption!
We're done with Corruption!
You must be hungry.
Eat this quietly. No one will know.
If a 70-year-old man can fast,
then why can't I?
Just let this bill get passed.
Then these corrupt
idiots will be taken to task!
I should have been a politician.
The kind of money they earn!
Did you vote? No, right?
If you did, you could
have brought about a change.
Who do I vote for?
They're all corrupt!
Blame someone else.
Now tell me, what's different
between you and a corrupt politician?
Kids from all over
the country come here.
What treatment?
They are all AIDS patients.
No... Nothing...
And anyways, AIDS
isn't transmitted by touch.
You know? You remind me of Shabana Azmi.
Since I was young I have
dreamed of having such a car.
And ﬁnally dad has agreed.
Buying a car from your
dad's money is no big deal.
Buy one on your own. That's something!
...because I don't want to
go to some "Tomatina" Festival
Yes. Because you've
forgotten to enjoy life.
These festivals only
look good in movies.
You know, in our country...
Country... Country... Dia,
you're not the Prime Minister.
You don't miss a
chance to bark your slogans.
Even I know one, "Live and let live!"
If I start commenting
on your lifestyle...
...it'll make you very upset.
I know.
Which is why I wonder
if I've made a mistake.
You're just saying all
this to scare me off.
And anyways, she wasn't wrong.
Maybe not, but real for sure.
Son. Leave some for next time!
On the wedding day, the
groom suddenly pretends.
Then the bride's relatives beg and say,
Can we meet tomorrow?
Alone?
And why this meeting?
...you're going to start
with the Kamal story again.
Isn't it the same guy?
The waiter at my house that day?
- No. - It's him.
I don't remember.
Let's talk about something else.
About Dia.
You two were so different.
How did you meet?
Like a guy falling from the 18th
ﬂoor meets the concrete below.
I had just returned from
studying architecture in America...
Oh man! We're stuck
here since 2O minutes!
We'll miss all the wedding festivities.
Relax. Why so tense?
Just forget the wedding.
It's my brother's wedding!
Don't talk rubbish.
Why're you smothering me?
Dia. Her name's Dia. Family friend.
A little crazy.
She's so weird, which is
why she's still single.
Her parents are so worried.
And hello!
She's much older to you.
But she's hot!
What are you doing here?
Playing football!
Can I borrow your jacket?
I'll clear the trafﬁc in 5 minutes.
Come on out!
I'll return both.
Take off your clothes.
How many months does it look like? 12?
- I'll do it on the way.
- What an amazing girl!
You're the husband. I'm the wife.
I'll clear this jam in 5 minutes.
- Has the Minister left? - Not yet.
Oh no no! Take your time.
You've stepped out...?
My water bag burst. How much longer?
Do something...
Do something...
Say "All is well"
It kicked! And so strong!
Looks like it's about
to happen right here!
Do something!
Look. We need to go to
the hostel right now!
Please just wait for 5 minutes.
Hold! Just hold!
Record this injustice on a mobile phone!
Oh man! No!
- Note his name down! Note it! - No. No.
Let them go Sir,
we'll fall into trouble.
Err... Do one thing ma'am,
you go ahead, please.
But our car is right at the back.
Ok. So bring it ahead.
Hey! Move the barricade!
Go help him!
Hey! What are you doing there? Come on!
- Come on, hurry! - Open it up.
- Are you crazy? - Hurry!
The Minister's convoy
will be coming any minute!
ls he pregnant as well?
Where is your car?
I can't see it, sir.
God will thank you.
If I have a boy, I
will name him after you...
Hey! Even if it's a
girl I'll name her Lahiri!
Hey! What are you doing?
Put up the barricade!
I'll lose my job, man!
- The Minister's on his way. - What?
Sir, just hold for 2 minutes.
Err... what was her name?
What?
Eff... NO I10...
Oh, honey!
The baby's coming.
That's why we're going to the hospital!
It's coming now!
What?
Hey! What's happening? Stop the traffic!
It's not about the pranks or fun.
So many people were harrowed.
They should consider the
public as well, right?
What?
Sounds like Sridevi.
What's happening, Dia?
Nothing much. Just
joined the Rotary Club.
Was returning from there and I got late.
Oh where's my daughter? Where's Dia?
There she is...
You didn't realize
that Joshna is my friend?
Your girlfriend?
But how will she even know?
You think I won't tell her?
She'll throw me out!
You're so much older than me.
Don't cry, my child...
What an idiot!
- Come on move!-
Yeah Yeah! I'm leaving.
What were you thinking?
...l still think she was correct.
Since we met she was leading me on.
What happened next?
You know they say that lightning
doesn't strike one place twice.
They're wrong.
Six months later.
India and Bangladesh were
playing a cricket match...
And Sachin Tendulkar was about
to make his 100th century...
...and my dad took me to
some stupid mall opening.
My ambition for the last two years.
I'm so very happy!
If the Municipal
Commissioner is pleased today...
One day, even you shall
build a mall like this.
Please, let me in...
I have some work inside.
If I could enter...
Oh, honey!
I completely forgot
you stay in Bangalore.
I didn't realize
she'll create such a scene.
We were all immature.
I hope you understand
you were wrong as well.
...and I'm apologizing.
Greetings everyone!
Mr. Venkat and his team
have worked very hard.
Bangalore city's development has
always been a challenge for me.
What's going on?
The land in Ramnagar allotted for a
sports ground by the government...
...has been seized by your
son-in-law to open a giant shopping mall!
Now the kids need a
place to play, right?
Bangalore city's development has
always been a challenge for you.
Forgive me...
Why are you getting upset?
What do you have to say?
Will you make grounds for the kids,
or will they have to play in malls?
What's your opinion on
corrupt ministers in this country?
Should they be put behind bars?
What's the future of this country?
Please respond, sir!
Now let's see what he does.
This mall will be...
But, why?
Because I'm certain Sachin Tendulkar
will make his 100th century today.
Oh, honey!
When will I see you next?
Will you behave?
Lunch tomorrow?
We came to this very restaurant.
There!
So for an NGO job, you
left Delhi for Bangalore?
I can't work in a bank-like place.
I've heard of weekend charity.
I have friends who do it...
But full-time agony on this salary?
It's better than being a loafer...
You and your Social Sisterhood...
...made his shopping
mall into a sports stadium!
I don't wish to hurt anyone.
I just aim to correct what's wrong.
What will you eat?
Listen, you aren't a vegetarian, I hope.
Why? Because I'm the NGO-type?
Yeah...
I'm a vegetarian.
You know, right?
Chicken don't provide Oxygen, shade...
Nor do they protect the
ozone layer in anyway.
So you rather save the
trees and eat chicken!
You know you lack
something up there, right?
Hey, one sec...
These are still alive!
Yeah, so?
How can you kill someone?
If you don't kill and
eat them, then what?
Should I adopt them?
It's good we didn't go to the zoo.
Or I would have to adopt God-knows what.
You get away with it
because you're pretty.
If it was someone else...
All talk and no action.
You're not as bad as you
portray yourself to be.
Hundred Percent Black Sheep!
Grandson of a Gandhian, and
you befriend the wrong people!
Who keeps such pets?
She's not wrong.
She's a charity worker. Her
landlady doesn't allow pets. That's why...
What should I do?
You have a lot of problems
with your father, right?
No, no...
He has the problems.
I have always been second.
There is no father in the world...
...who doesn't have
minor issues with his son.
Anyway, forget all that.
What's tomorrow's plan?
Tomorrow, let me take you out.
I guarantee you haven't
seen this side of Bangalore.
I hope you haven't seen it.
Hey, cutie! Let's get a room.
Eh hero... are you coming?
I've never been here before.
If anyone spots me here,
my dad will kill me...
Punishment without any pleasure...
Don't worry. I'll make sure
your reputation isn't ruined.
And my entire team is here. Come!
Or else... I would
have been pimped away.
Where's everyone else?
They've all ditched us.
Somebody's mom disallowed.
One has his brother's birthday...
And some have a mosquito allergy.
They're all fools!
Brilliant! What dedication
from the Social Sisterhood.
Why does he have a camera?
We're making a documentary
on the life of sex workers.
You're not making that
kind of a ﬁlm, right?
What now?
Whether they come or not, we're here.
We'll make this documentary happen.
Are you crazy?
You've gone to the red light area?
Archana's mother has told me everything.
We're making a documentary, mom!
Why the drama?
It's our mistake, Dia that
we've been so lenient...
Why do you do such work?
Which boy will marry you?
We'll get many boys for that.
If none of the other girls were going,
why did you venture out?
Now listen to me...
...promise me you will leave
right now... immediately...
I've said it... now!
I believe there's a problem?
Who is this?
We are here with your daughter.
That's right! These kids have
taken full police protection.
Do note my number, you
can call me anytime.
Oh yes. Of Course. One minute.
I'm just searching for a pen.
Yes, tell me...
This used to be a monastery earlier.
Only a couple of
builders know about this place.
So the negotiation is very strong.
We can easily build an orphanage here.
If your dad is
refusing to buy you an Audi...
...why vent the anger on
me and my poor orphanage?
There are bigger
problems than this in life.
You mustn't brood like this.
There are bigger
problems than this in life.
You mustn't brood like this.
They want to get me married off!
There's so much to do in life...
And if I refuse,
there's emotional drama.
"Great-grandma is withering.
She's serious..."
"Dad is so tensed..."
I can't believe all
this isn't disturbing you.
It's not.
Cause anyway I know we
don't have a future together.
Take my advice. Get married.
One minute.
Not that I'm dying to
get married to you...
...but what do you mean by, "we
don't have a future together?"
We're so different.
You're a Punjabi from Delhi.
I'm Tamilian from Bangalore.
You want to open an orphanage and I...
So what have you been doing with
me for the past year and a half?
I'm only kidding. Why
take it so seriously?
I'm not kidding.
Pick me up at 6pm.
The ﬂight is at 8.
"Whenever I try to say some good..."
"...my words get me misunderstood."
I told you...
...you aren't as emotionless...
...as you portray yourself to be.
I'm orphaned, mother!
How will I live without you?
There's that guy.
Mr. Dhillon's son, Naresh.
Sitting in white.
Then there's that one...
in white.
Colonel Suri's grandson.
But the one I like...
...is there, sitting in off-white.
Sharmila aunty's son.
She's right.
They're all in white.
When they're in colours,
it'll be easier...
I don't want to get married.
If I had told my
mother the same thing...
...you wouldn't be here today.
Thank you. May she rest in peace.
Why don't you want to marry?
Hey, who's that?
I'm in sales for thirty years.
So, for me...
Why should I give you my daughter?
What qualities do you have
that other boys don't have?
I have many qualities that
others my age don't possess.
I'm lazy...
...aimless, and completely useless.
ls he joking?
No sir. Of course not!
I'm so eccentric that
living with me is hell!
But whatever you say,
you daughter is way ahead.
I know her for just over a year.
You've handled her since childhood.
Every seven days, she voices
eight issues with ten demonstrations.
There's the fear of riots.
And sometimes arrest.
Will she return home safely?
She ignores the
suffering of her loved ones.
Yeah, but there was a lot of police...
It was me!
A hundred times I warned her,
"Don't go there..."
But you know how adamant she is.
Thankfully, I was present there
or anything could have happened...
Let's break it down.
Your daughter is a living,
breathing Tension Machine.
Whoever she's with,
his life is in danger.
And you're in sales for thirty years.
You're aware how difficult it
is to unload defective goods.
So now you tell me...
...why should I take your daughter?
Match is made!
What a marvel you are!
See?
Convinced them!
What? Have you seen your face?
I look like a defective piece?
I can't ﬁnd a single
issue with your love story.
She's exactly like Kamal.
But I haven't changed my decision.
So, now what?
You want me to give
you away at your wedding?
Why are you telling me all this.
Tell your parents.
I want to Sriram...
...but I can't.
I guess you won't understand.
You should talk to them.
They want to get us
married in full-speed.
Now, you place the ring...
"Oh Lord, I know not who I am..."
Punjabi dish in a
South Indian restaurant?
"Oh Lord, I know not who I am..."
"Nor am I a believer of religion..."
"Nor do I believe in salvation..."
ls this guy a part of your dowry?
"Oh Lord, I know not who I am..."
"Oh Lord, I know not who I am..."
Who are you?
Stalker? Hit man?
Where ever I go, I ﬁnd you.
Whatever it is, you sing well.
a.k.a. Kamal.
What did you think? You'd
come here and achieve something?
Just because you think
Kamal is a Sikh, you feel...
It doesn't matter what I feel.
Your parents will feel a real jolt.
They call me racist.
They are the real racists.
Which is why Vasudha is quietly
agreeing to this marriage, otherwise...
Otherwise what? It
wouldn't change anything.
Today you simply sang a song...
After marrying her,
you'll sing for alleviation.
What do you mean?
Where will you stay after the wedding?
My family is in Chandigarh.
But I have my job here.
Who will I teach
Carnatic music in Chandigarh?
Teach something else...
What will you name your children?
They'll where the
sacred thread or bracelet?
Where will the ceremony occur?
Hindu Temple or Sikh temple?
Idli tastes best with Sam bar...
- ...not with Masala. - Enough!
- Vasudha and I are in... - In love?
So much that you'll
leave your family and city...
...and settle here are a misﬁt?
Forget Sikh Festivals
and celebrate Pongal?
Forget wheat and have rice?
Dance to South Indian tunes
instead of the Punjabi beat?
Even if you do...
...the cultural difference is enormous.
Before you love someone else,
learn to love yourself...
It's best in the long run.
Come come...
What do I do with this?
Keep it.
Maybe you'll learn to
love someone other than you.
Sandy, why are you so restless?
It's not your wedding.
Kamal sent me this message.
Chandigarh or Bangalore,
I want to be with you.
Surjeet or Savitri,
whatever the name be...
...they will be our kids.
They can wear the
sacred bracelet or thread.
Worship whoever they want.
As for me...
...for the rest of my life I
will dance to your family's tunes...
...be an outsider and feel content.
Looks like Kammu's message
triggered off Sandy as well.
ls this the same crab?
You still have it?
YES.
What really happened
between you and Dia?
Well, I've told you the entire story...
How did it end?
What happened ﬁnally...
...when you realized...
Have to show you something.
What?
Not like this...
YES.
This is the best day of my life.
And what did you do in return?
What enormous favour did you
do that he bought you the car?
I just broke him a land deal. That's it.
Which land did you deal?
Which land did you deal, Sriram?
You wouldn't have got that monestary.
I found out. Many
builders were after it.
You had no chance.
I had a chance!
Before you sold that
land through your company.
Open your orphanage somewhere else.
Yes, I sold it.
Whoever bid the highest, got the land.
No Sriram.
Why am I doing all this?
FOP US...
So that you, your parents...
You did it for that...
You can point out my mistake,
the world's mistakes...
But do you notice your own ﬂaws?
What have I done?
With the safety net of your
wealthy family, you cry about the poor.
Sit in an Italian restaurant and
talk about the undernourished.
Wiping the tears off the
oppressed for ten minutes...
...doesn't make you a hero.
If you empathize so much, why
don't you go stay with them?
Can you?
NO. right?
Commentary comes easy Dia.
What's hard is playing the match.
Debates, demonstrations,
protests that's all you can do.
Then what's the
difference between you and me?
Maybe you get a high by
putting down others around you...
...so that you can feel
better about yourself.
No one here is a
hundred percent correct, Dia.
Everyone has ﬂaws...
You, your lifestyle,
your fake social work...
Why can't you just be normal?
Stop weeping, and don't
ever lecture me again.
I will never say a word to you again.
She went back to Delhi.
What do you think?
Does Vasudha also think it's my fault?
If I wouldn't have bought the
monastery, someone else would have.
Girls, I tell you.
I wish they were all like you.
What happened?
Sriram is a little delayed.
He's upset since last night.
His pet passed away.
You shouldn't have sold the monestary.
And should've stopped Dia.
You say you've forgotten her.
You not only remember
the times with her...
...but the exact dates.
Your face lights up
when you talk about her.
Our ﬁrst date?
Was the exact same
restaurant you took her.
I'm a complete rebound case.
You've only ever loved one person...
...Dia.
And you told me this yourself.
ReaHy?
Then why do you seem more
upset than me about this wedding?
Because of Sandy.
Last night...
The last link between you and Dia.
And last night, that broke too...
And you lost Dia forever.
If Kamal and I had even half
the moments of your love story...
...l wouldn't be here today.
And if you have any brains...
...and can bend your
ego for just a minute...
Then leave this wedding and run for it.
Think again.
Think again.
If you still want to marry me...
I'm sitting right here.
Don't leave the wedding and go to Kashi.
Marry my daughter.
If you leave, where will she go?
If you get married,
your life will be ruined.
Run!
My girl will worship you...
...feed you and love you like no other.
Fly, my son...
Fly...
Sriram, if you're my son, run! Run!
Walk it up! You need to lose weight.
Hey! I was here ﬁrst! What an idiot...
- Sorry, man... - Fool...
ls Dia here?
Dia isn't here, son.
Look...
I know...
...you must be upset.
And it's my fault...
But until I don't win her back...
She really isn't here.
She's gone. To Gujarat.
What?
Gujarat?
For an NGO trip?
No no. Less of the 'N'
and more of the 'G-O'.
Nowadays she comes here
for a trip, to her own home.
I had told you.
Don't be so lenient with
her that we lose all control.
But, what is she doing there?
For the last eleven months
she's moved to a village.
What's it called...
...Jhumli.
Village?
On the border of
Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.
Oh don't worry, she'll be back.
Don't worry.
I'll bring her back.
How do you get to this Jhumli?
It's a very easy route...
Let's have the Thepla...
How does one get from Gondhva to Jhumli?
I hope there isn't another train.
No no. Not a train.
How does one get from
Sharavari Taal to Jhumli?
I hope there isn't another bus.
No no. Not a bus.
The journey ends here.
You'll have to walk it up now.
Walk? Are you crazy?
Sir, this vehicle won't go ahead.
The road is naano.
Oh. We'll go in the Nano car?
Sir, not Nano.
Naano road.
In Gujarati, 'naano' means 'small'...
...and 'mote' means 'big'.
There's another road.
Around the hillside.
Fifty-ﬁve kilometres long.
It'll take four hours.
Ok. See you!
Let's go!
NO...
Hey brother...
Don't be afraid. Grip it
like this and cross it.
It's very dangerous!
Mom dangerous.
It's simple!
I'll show you.
No no... You'll slip and fall...
Hey Mowgli...
This isn't a circus!
Come on... give me
your hand. Don't worry.
Come Oﬂ.
Give me your hand...
Hold it. Come on. Come come.
Carefully...
Come... Come...
Carefully... carefully...
Carefully... carefully...
Hey! Watch out!
Watch it!
Careful. Slowly.
Come HOW...
"Oh brother, my brother."
"Why do you fear?"
"The earth is ours and
the water is near..."
Now I understand why Dia is
stuck on this side of the bridge.
Who the hell can cross this?
I like the glasses...
Forget that.
Tell me.
Dia Sharma.
Fair Behen?
Come. Come.
- Come. - Fair Behen?
Come.
And this. This is Mohan uncle's house.
The Head of the village.
What are you doing, blind fellow?
Laali aunty?
I'll pick Laali up on my
back and cross the bridge?
And who'll pick you up then?
The Almighty?
I'll go opposite and pull the rope.
So that the bridge falls apart?
So you expect me to
get a helicopter then?
No. Fair Behen.
I can't go ahead...
We'll take the other road?
Oh uncle, the other road is around
the hillside! It'll take ﬁve hours.
Mohanbhai, let's turn around...
Laali trying to cross
the bridge in this state...
...can spell trouble.
Then... how will we reach the hospital?
I will deliver Laa
i's child.
YOU?
Who delivered Chanda?
Come on. Let's hurry.
But Chanda was a goat...
We know... now let's go...
Come on... Pull...
Budhna, you loser...
Next time, you give
birth to the child...
It's a girl.
And thank God she
resembles the mother...
You hear, Budhna?
You're a father. Again!
Now beat the addiction.
Or I'll beat you up!
First she was crazy. Now
she's completely lost it.
Become the mid-wife of the village.
I'm happy here.
Really happy.
This is the world's
most beautiful place.
You have a grey strand...
Oh yeah, since a while...
Let's go back home...
You'd see me and... do this...
I'm done with that chapter of my life.
So you won't return...
NO.
And spend your life here...
- In this village? - Yes.
In this dirt and poverty?
YES.
From who are you exacting revenge?
Your Bangalore social work was better.
You haven't changed.
You must be exhausted.
Stay over tonight in the hut nearby...
Take some photos and leave tomorrow.
Dia, I'm not a tourist.
Anyway there isn't
anything here worth seeing.
Except for dirt and poverty.
And who's Sri ram ?
I'm Sridevi remember?
You... You just delivered a child...
Agirl...
Do you need more gravy?
No... thank you.
What's going on here?
Do you get any chicken here?
Chicken?
For chicken you'll have to travel far.
Won't get it here.
Dia was right.
There's a serious problem in Jhumli.
No chicken in the village!
Oh, honey!
Why don't they leave me alone?
What's their problem?
They're trying to
tell you to return home.
ReaHy?
I thought they're
telling me to get married.
Here, look at this...
lv'e been pranking
these idiots since morning.
If you make fun of them, I'll slap you!
Mohanbhai, right?
Sriram.
But if you wish, you
can call me Sridevi...
...just like Fair Behen does.
'Behen' means 'sister'
Just Fair One.
Fairest of the village.
I don't know Gujarati.
Please stop all this drama.
We have some important
business to attend to.
Mohanbhai, where are you going?
Sridevi Brother, Madam and I
are going to visit Lateshbhai...
...the Regional Collector.
What does he collect? Stamps?
Taxes for no beneﬁt. And
curses from all the villagers.
Now if you're done with your RTl act...
...please leave and stop irritating me!
No, Dia. I won't leave.
"l proclaim it, and the heavens above.
"I've fallen for you
like an innocent dove."
"Oh, I'm in love!
I'm in love! I'm in..."
"...love!"
Hey Salman Khan!
What's the problem? Come?
We'll have to cross this
very bridge to go back home.
Lateshbhai we...
One minute, one minute, Mother India.
This is my son.
Bhavtesh.
Last Sunday was his eighteenth birthday.
I asked. What do you want?
What did you say?
Here you go.
Dad, can I drive it?
NO.
- Lateshbhai, about
the bridge... - Sir...
...is that your father?
That's my father.
Forever in his own world.
Gandhian.
Hero for the world. But a zero at home.
For thirty-nine years he was in
the party and gave his son? Nothing!
The property, farmhouse, the
buffaloes are fruits of my efforts.
He gave me nothing.
He has a family property in Narora.
But he sits on it like a snake.
Neither does he sell it,
nor does he give it to me.
Lateshbhai, you've been
ignoring us for six months...
Yesterday a pregnant woman was stuck...
Delivery done?
Yes. But should've
happened at a hospital.
Not you.
I'm asking him.
Sir, if you'll just give
us the balance payment...
YES.
Stand here.
You begging for money? Throw him out!
It's not about the money.
There's something bigger than money.
Respect!
I had given you'll a chance.
Give me ten acres of land from
Jhumli and make your bridge.
Lateshbhai it's about the principle.
Being the regional collector,
it's your duty to make the bridge...
If you refuse to make the bridge...
...l will be forced to
approach MP Kirtibhai.
Dad, can I drive it?
No!
If the bridge is made...
...all ofJhumli's
problems will be solved.
A three-crore rupee
bridge for just 270 people?
There's no chance!
I don't know about three-crores...
...but this bridge will
be done in three months.
Dad, can I drive it?
No!
Who's this?
Are you an engineer?
Sir, I'm an architect.
Which is why I know.
Can I drive it?
Drive it up your backside!
Okay. Okay, Mother India.
You've got your contractor so
that he can make his commission.
No. I understand all these tricks!
You son of a...
Sriram, one minute...
Dad, can I drive it?
Yeah, drive it!
You son of a donkey...
What have you done?
You wrecked the new car!
You fool! Idiot!
You can bid adieu to your bridge.
Now suffer in Jhumli without one.
I'm never making that bridge...
And you... Exactly like your
stupid mother... Can't you...
Your father will also make it happen!
Father.
What sort of idiot have you brought up?
You're a gandhian...
Just give him the property.
And in return, tell
him to make the bridge.
My new car!
Wrecked my new car!
Run... run...
I'll make it!
The distance between you and me.
That I'll cover by making the...
Just get it approved by MP Kirtibhhai...
...I'll handle the rest.
Isn't it nice? My...
Go play-
One minute. One minute.
ls going to use his
rusted architecture degree...
...work hard, stay in this village...
...and make a bridge for me?
Not for you, Fair One.
I'm doing this for these poor,
helpless villagers.
Stop this 'Nliss India' speech.
What's the real deal?
Their problems won't be
solved till this bridge is made.
Till their problems are solved,
you won't leave.
And till I won't leave,
your problem isn't solved.
Ok. Done.
What's done?
The day the bridge is made,
I'll return with you to Bangalore.
You're sure?
- You aren't fooling me,
right? - Fair Behen!
What's Rattan saying?
Sridevi bhai is
making the bridge for us?
Then we'll be able to take
the big bus to the big school?
It won't be easy.
Making a bridge is still far away.
You won't last here for even ten days.
Start counting Fair One.
I'll manage.
And I love the smell of cow dung.
You think you're some hero?
The bridge my father
gave his life up for...
...you think you can
accomplish with your tom-foolery?
You'll fall ﬂat on your face, mate...
...and there won't
be anyone to save you.
The day I'll ﬁnd a barbecue...
---V0l1'
l go missing!
What do I say about Mahato?
His father, Dhanji he
did a lot for this village.
But see his luck.
This bridge was the
reason he lost his life.
He suffered a heart attack...
...and we couldn't even
take him to the hospital?
If I don't get this bridge made...
...then my name isn't Sriram.
This Mahato is a twit.
He doesn't have any
respect for his elders.
Now you're the Head here.
Mohanbhai, have you lost
something that you're searching for?
Then... why are you always slouching?
These ninety feet
seem like nine thousand.
Where's the screw? Where's the screw?
No no... Forget it. Move ahead.
Lateshbhai said Kirtibhai is so
strict he doesn't entertain anyone.
There's an entire line waiting here.
What now, Madamji?
What do you mean, 'what
now?' Let's get in line!
Spiritual Ceremony?
No. It's his mother's death anniversary.
This is a prayer meeting.
For Kirtibhai's mother.
Lunch is being served. You
think they'll have chicken?
Yes. Why not? Go inquire...
Come, Mohanbhai...
Dammit!
Crazy as ever...
Greetings, Kirtibhai.
I'm Dia Sharma.
From Jhumli.
I know this isn't the right time...
...but it's with great
difficulty that I have reached here.
Father, just give him the property.
And spare all our lives.
Just look at those security guards.
They'll turn us to pulp.
Twenty seven people have lost
their life due to the bridge.
Here's the report.
Kindly review it, please...
I'll then make an
appointment to meet you.
We're dead!
Your 'maa ne’...
How did these people enter?
I get just one day of the year
to remember my deceased mother.
And I spend it serving these idiots?
What're you waiting for? Throw them out!
I'll set you straight!
Get out! Your 'maa ne’...
And you get out, Mother India! Get lost!
Not Mother India! Grandmother India.
And I promise you'll
go crying back to her.
Now I'll go straight
to the Chief Minister.
Go to the Prime Minister for all I
care. Get lost! Get out of here!
Not me... your 'maa ne’...
What's this 'Nlaa ne?'
It means 'Your mother's...' in Gujarati.
Not mine! Your mother's...
Your mother's...
What?
Your mother...
Rasilaben!
Your mother Rasilaben
deserves a great honour.
Which is why we specially
got this proposal today.
We want to name the bridge on Jhumli...
...after your mother: Rasilaben Bridge.
We just came to seek your blessing.
My»-
My mother... a bridge in her name?
I'm touched.
Kirtibhai, you don't know
this guy. He's a scoundrel.
You numb-skull!
You dare to come
between me and my mother?
A bridge in my mother's name...
...will be made in Jhumli.
The foundation stone
shall be laid tomorrow.
Hail, Lord Sri Ram!
Hail, Lord Sri Ram!
No no... Even they deserve some credit.
Once the bridge is made, the
children will be able to attend school.
It'll be easy.
You'll really be sorry...
...the day I exact
revenge for that slap.
And this slap won't hurt your body.
It'll break your soul.
Kirtibhai, you heard that?
Do you think I'm a fool?
Making this bridge for you lazy people?
Stop taking my things.
Sriram, I'm not coming back with you.
Liar! Ditcher!
That was a joke.
What do you think?
Jhumli is the only
village with problems?
As soon as the issues are solved here,
I'll move to another village.
Fine.
Then I'll follow you there as well.
I ran away from my wedding for you...
Till you don't come
running back to me...
...I'm going nowhere.
WhV don't you get it?
I get it.
But I also know that you
aren't as emotionless...
...as you portray yourself to be.
What do I do with this?
Break open you head?
Then you'll lose one
brick of the bridge...
This is the ﬁrst brick
of the bridge foundation.
Tomorrow you'll get
your return gift as well.
You won't see that white hair.
You look good old as well...
Ninety feet.
Now seem like forty-ﬁve.
He's cut off all ties with you.
He's removed your name
from the company as well.
Then tell him, from today
I want nothing from him.
You'll cut off blood ties
for a North Indian girl?
Your Punjabi inﬂuence has
affected poor Vasudha as well.
She's married to a Punjabi! Sardarji...
with a turban!
Come quick!
Move back!
- What's going on here?
- What's happening?
From now on, the bridge work is shut!
- What do you mean, shut? -
Shut means shut! You heard me!
What happened?
Kirtibhai is caught in
a huge petrol scam...
...and sent to jail.
He's been expelled from the party too
Which is why you can't make a
bridge in his mother's name anymore.
What's this? Oh Lord! It's raining!
Come on, hurry! Take care of your huts!
Cover them up...
This unexpected rainfall
is so pleasant to see.
You don't have the same
problem as in 'Lagaan,' right?
No sir. Why?
Then why are you so excited?
Now we won't plead
before anyone for this bridge.
No Kirtibhai. No Lateshbhai.
And no third idiot.
We'll make it ourselves.
Here's the architect.
And here's the labour.
This tea isn't spiked, is it?
See how one shower of rain
has brought them all together.
This is how we'll all
make the bridge together.
Dia we need to make a bridge!
Not cover it with blue plastic.
Are you with me, or not?
Forget me. No one's
going to support you on this.
Fine. Stay out.
But beware...
Before Lateshbhai gets here...
...the entire Jhumli will be
putting their hands to work...
Looks like all the
villagers have drowned in the rain.
Aunty, why did you come?
How will you work at this age?
No dear. We haven't come to work.
We have just come to tell you
that no one will work on the bridge.
YES.
Madamji, it's the holy month of Death.
We can't start any new venture.
It's bad luck.
Yes. If our forefathers are angered,
the bridge will fall.
Yes and next year we'll
celebrate your month of Death.
Madamji, if we start after this month...
Till then, Lateshbhai will
hatch a new plot to stop us.
Fine.
Go worship your fore-fathers.
Whatever needs to be done...
...I'll do myself.
Idiots! If you don't care,
what am I doing?
Go to hell, all of you!
Lateshbhai, not ten, take twenty acres!
These guys won't utter a word!
There's no better way to
honour my father than this.
Come.
Dude brother.
How much more time for
the bridge to complete?
You're in a hurry!
What will you study to become?
Doctor or hero?
I... I don't know.
Go... work...
Tell us what to do...
They won't leave me...
Sir. I'm done with a hundred.
Your're done?
- ls there electricity? - Yes sir.
- ls the fan new? - Yes sir.
Then why isn't it working?
Do another hundred.
Stop this nonsense.
Not you! Stop their nonsense.
Send across a notice.
Using government equipment
and machinery is forbidden.
Do one thing.
Just get all the material picked up.
Sridevibhai...
...do something.
Do something Sridevibhai...
You twit! Do it correctly.
If we name the bridge after your father?
After this old lunatic?
Who doesn't give his
own son his property?
Are you out of your mind?
Father, just give it to him...
...and tell him to
make the bridge in return.
Just twenty acres of land.
Ten that I wanted earlier for my farm...
...and ten as the price of that slap.
ls this land of any use to you?
No. It's a wasteland.
Then sign it.
Look, there's no other way.
But madamji...
We'll have to do it secretly.
Nothing works in this
country without give-n-take.
We understand all this. Dia
and her principles won't get it.
Very good!
Take it that your bridge is made.
Sir, just one request.
Till the bridge isn't made,
you don't step into Jhumli.
The thing is, once the bridge
is made, Dia will leave with me.
Then you're happy and the
villagers are happy too.
How did you convince Lateshbhai?
Just looked deep into
his eyes and said...
...recover the cost
of the bridge from me!
Atleast you bowed down to somone...
Yeah. But he has really hairy legs.
I'm sure, in your love,
he'll get those shaved as well.
Looks like I'll have to start packing.
Madam, whats the
point of arguing with me?
Ask him, your 'hero?'
Lateshbhai, you said you'll come
here only after the bridge is made.
Yeah. But my factory
plans got ready early. So?
Whether he makes a farm or factory,
...or the Taj Mahal, our
bridge is getting made.
That is why I didn't
want to give him the land.
They will contaminate
the water around here.
The entire Jhumli will be
ruined and displaced. Finished!
Lateshbhai, you will
make no plant here...
The deal is done!
Look at this.
Lateshbhai you have played a game.
Stop this nonsense and get out of here.
Why are you so enraged Mr. Hero?
When did you start
caring about the village?
You're getting what you want.
You said it yourself that
once the bridge is complete...
...I'll take my
heroine across it and leave.
Hadn't you said it?
And remember what I had promised?
The slap that will break your soul?
If in six months I haven't
put up this chemical plant...
...and ruined your stupid Jhumli...
...then my name isn't
Lateshbhai Dhaneshbhai Shah...
...the son of my father.
Hail Lord Sri Ram!
Come on! Run along!
He's intentionally
created such a situation.
He's such a rascal.
You've repeated the same mistake...
“again!
Dia, whatever I'm doing, I'm
not doing it for myself...
Again?
I'll do something.
I'll ﬁnd a way...
Now, you can't do anything.
If you want to help,
then pack your bags.
Now solving this mess
is my responsibility.
Not yours.
I'm not leaving this village.
Then I'm leaving.
After doing so much, this is what I get?
Dude brother!
Dude brother!
I didn't say it that day...
But when I grow up, I
want to be like you.
- Dad, I... - Need money?
Bored of the village?
Want to return home?
Just wanted to say...
...you were right.
And wrong as well.
There is someone in this
world who idolizes me.
And I will not abandon him.
What happened?
The black sheep...
...isn't black anymore.
I haven't ever spoken up before.
But he had told me
slouching isn't the way.
Which is why for the ﬁrst time,
I wish to voice my opinion.
If he was wrong, so was I.
And he wasn't wrong.
After all, he was the
one making the bridge.
Fair Behen. They've arrived.
Come on. Hurry up! I don't have all day.
Come, come all of you.
I took care of one idiot,
all you others... come come.
Lateshbhai, this factory...
Your 'hero' had come this morning.
Felt like giving him one tight one!
Whatever you want... say it quick.
There.
My ego is kneeling before you.
Do whatever you wish to me but...
But please leave the
village alone. Right?
I understood what my
father kept lecturing me.
All I want is...
...what your father
doesn't lecture you...
...you understand that.
You've lost it.
Even I have sworn on my father...
I won't leave that village.
Now tell me. What're
you going to do about it?
I'll stop you.
Stop me?
How?
I don't know. But I'll ﬁnd a way.
Whatever it takes...
...l won't let that village get ruined.
Said it?
Done?
Now leave.
Someone get him out of here. Get out!
Hey! What are you doing? Let me go!
Leave that vilage alone.
Or else... I'll kill him.
You want to kill him?
Dad, do something!
Kill him!
If my father was never mine,
why should I be there for my son?
- Kill him. Go ahead. - Dad,
what are you saying?
Let me go!
Kill him! Go ahead.
Enough. Enough. Stop.
Stop. You'll kill him.
Why are you getting beaten up?
I don't like all this.
Throw him out of here.
Without any respect.
You're a persistent fellow.
What happened to you?
Property papers.
Sell it.
But make their bridge.
Else, forget me being your father...
...you aren't my son.
What, father?
Woke up so late?
He will never change, son.
I was just waiting to see...
...when you would change.
Dad, this is a 'hero!'
This was a true slap on the soul.
Now how could I live at home?
My father and son,
both consider him a hero.
Hey! Take that down...
Keep your land and your bridge.
But where is he?
Where else?
Making your bridge!
One minute, Mother India!
He told me to show you one more thing.
I don't know why he told me to...
But how does it look, Mayankbhai?
"l ran away from my wedding for you..."
"Till you don't come running
back to me, I'm going nowhere."
Oh, Fair One!
You can take the new one...
mbridge!
Oh, honey!
Dude brother isn't speaking to you.
What? You're crying?
I think all city girls
should run off to a village.
The country will be ruined.
Now what?
Should I pack your bags too?
Who said I'm coming home with you.
I said I'll come the
day this bridge is made.
This is still incomplete.
Will you come with me?
The bridge is made!
Lateshbhai, may God bless you...
Thank you very much!
Put those sticks down.
- Be careful! - I'm faster!
Let's go?
YES.
What time is the train?
Tell me something...
Can we stay back in a near-by village?
There's no electricity there.
I become an electrician now?
Yeah. So what's the big deal?
Okay, just for a week.
_ 5 days, - 5 days?
Mom's dinner?
Liar!
Ditcher!
Oh, Honey!
Dad will throw me out again!
