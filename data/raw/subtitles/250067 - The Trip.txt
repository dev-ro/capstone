Leave? You can't leave!
I have a million things
I have to do today ...
But Peter I can't thank you enough
for helping us put a quick end to the strike.
These damn unionists,
they just make my blood boil.
I really appreciate you
burning the midnight oil to put a stop to it.
The Tribune couldn't have continued publishing
without your counsel.
It was my pleasure, Hal.
Well, if there is anything I can ever do for you,
please let me know.
You bet. It was good to see you.
Peter! Finally I get through to you.
- Congratulations on your ...
- Thanks! Excuse me.
- Uh, there's someone that I want you to meet.
- Sure!
- Hi!
- Hi!
- You enjoying the party?
- Yes, thanks for inviting me.
This is Larry Jenkins.
Larry's a very dear friend of mine.
We went to school together in Boston.
He's a publisher.
Now, Alan's dad was in the marines with Hal.
And now Alan works for Hal
over at The Tribune.
I am an intern actually.
Just graduated from UCLA
and is writing his first book.
And Hal tells me he's a
very talented writer.
Well ... send it on over to me when you're finished.
I'd love to read it.
Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Uhuh.
Listen. I gotta get on my way. Great party, buddy!
Thanks!
Uhm, why don't you stick around
for a while after everyone else's left.
We can discuss your future.
I-I-I have to give Hal a ride home
and I still have some writing to do.
Well it's simple...
You just come back here after all that.
Cause that's when the real party
starts anyway.
I-I don't think I can.
I insist.
Ok, thanks.

Hello?
Oh! When the chicken is away,
the rooster will play, hmm?
Look, uh ... "Greg Brady,"
Next time you want
to steal everyone's trick,
why don't you go home first
and rethink the outfit, ok?
Uh ... I was just leaving.
Ok, Ok! Why don't you get to the morgue
and check your boyfriend back in, alright?
Oh!
Merv!
This, unfortunately, is my roommate Michael,
who sometimes makes the first impression
that shows him for who he truly is.
Cute!
Mervin, don't be upset.
Generally he is a cool guy, but he
gets a little obnoxious when he's been drinking ...
or eating or talking.
He's the first friend I made
when I moved here a year ago
- I'm Tommy, by the way.
- Alan.
And what's your connection here?
I met Peter through the LA Tribune.
In the personal ads?
No, he just negotiated a quick end
to a major strike for us
and he invited my boss
and a bunch of others over to celebrate earlier.
And then he invited me back here ... tonight.
So you're a writer?
Yeah.
What do you write?
I'm working on my first book.
- What's it about?
- Ironically enough ...
Haha ...
the homosexual lifestyle
through the ages.
The homosexual lifestyle only has
two ages: a young and 29.
Ahahaha!
Actually I work with a group who's goal is
to change people's negative view on gays.
My goal is my biggest challenge.
Ha!
You know, I'd love to
interview you sometime.
Hmm! That's a new one.
Come here.
Uhm ... I--I should get going.
See ya!
- Hello
- Can I speak with Tommy, please?
- Yeah, who's this?
- This is Alan Oakley from last night.
- Oh! Oh, hey!
- I was just checking to see if you'd like to have dinner tonight?
- Uh, sure! What time?
[KNOCKING]
Hi, you must be Tommy?
Alan has told me so much about you!
Come in, please.
For me?
How sweet!
Aww!
Uh, who are you?
Oh, I'm Beverly.
Tommy, hey!
Sorry! Sorry!
Right on time, too!
- Don't get used to it.
- So you met Beverly.
We've done our introductions.
So Alan tells me that you are homosexual.
Beverly!
Only cause there's nothing good on television.
I just find it so intriguing!
Uh, not always. Liberace, for example.
Ahahaha!
Liberace is a homosexual?
Sadly, yes.
Uhm ... let me take this, thank you.
I'm gonna check on dinner.
Why don't we get to know
each other a little better, hmm?
So what was it like growing up in San Francisco?
I'm from Texas.
Are you from the Valley?
You are so good!
[GIGGLES]
I--I'm confused.
Oh, I know sweetie. It's probably because
you had a very dominating mother.
So, what do you two have planned for the menu
tonight? A menage a trois?
Oh, no!
Alan hates French food.
Are you for real?
Excuse me?
I--I said ... uhm ... are--are you a Leo?
You know, I-I should be honest.
I really don't know that many homosexuals ...
Except Giorgio ... my hairdresser.
Oh, he is so good!
Do ... do you do hair?
Well, not so much other people's. I do mine.
- I loved it.
- Thanks.
Oh, and Maurice, my interior decorator ...
He does all kinds of ... you know?
Do you know him?
Uhm, limp wrists, slight lisp and a flair for colors?
That's him!
Ooh!
Let's bond ...
I'll get my candles, and bells,
and we'll chant.
That would be great ... yeah ...
So, you and Beverly getting
to know one another?
Uh, yeah, I'm--I'm getting to know her.
Just don't get her started on her guru,
you'll be on her knees before you know it.
You wish ...
Huh?
Uh, is she your ...
Shandi awaits us.
Oh, honey, dinner's ready.
Aww ...
So what are you two like, a couple?
Oh, no! No ...
He is my lover.
Isn't he dreamy?
I think I need to smoke some pot!
Oh, that sounds great!
You don't smoke pot, Beverly.
No, we've never smoke but the gods smoke pot ...
our American Indians smoke pot.
It brings us closer to our inner ... uhm ...
... unconsciousness.
- And Shandi would have approved.
- You're so good!
No, I don't smoke pot.
Come on, it's just like smoking a cigarette.
I don't smoke cigarettes.
Honestly, Alan,
you are such a slave to reality.
Go ahead, it's no big deal...
if you are worried about a political career,
just don't inhale.
[SIGHS]
So when did you decide
you wanted to be a writer?
Uhm ... it's always been
my dream since I was a child.
When did you first realize
you were gay?
Well, it has always been
my dream since I was a child.
Ever since I was a child, I always...
So does your family know that
you're doing gay rights work?
No, they're old time dunk me if you got 'em Baptist but, uh,
they knew it's something that I believe in ...
and they are behind me.
The only thing that I ever have behind me
was my father's boot.
"Get a job, get married,
join the military."
"Visit exotic locations, meet
interesting people and kill them!"
There is nothing worse than a military father.
Y--Y--You, you always have guns
around the house when I was growing up.
One day when I was 13, I picked
one up and it accidentally went off.
I killed Patton.
Patton?
Our parrot.
[COUGHS]
I'll never forget Patton's last words...
"Polly wants a casket?"
I get these variations of shakes
everytime I get near gun.
I can't even look at one without
hearing "Rawwwk!"
Sweetie, you never told me that!
- So where are you from originally?
- Seguin, Texas.
W--Why come to Los Angeles to change
people's views about gays?
It seems like Texas needs it
more than LA.
Well, I tried to group together in college
but the only place they were willing to stand
together was the library men's room.
I spent a lot of  time in the
library men's room, too.
When did you have your first gay encounter?
Hmm ...
8th grade, January 12, 1968,
3:45 pm. It was a Friday.
That's very precise.
It was very precise.
Something weird is going on here.
What, is this supposed to be a date or something?
[NERVOUS LAUGHTER]
I thought it was.
What?
He's teasing you, honey.
No. I don't think he was.
Now I know why you didn't want
me here in the first place.
Well, because this is for my book.
I'm going home to chant for you, Alan.
Beverly, wait!
Wait a minute, I forgot something:
Cocksucker!
Was that an insult?
You are so cool!
- Sorry, I don't mean to ...
- No! It's okay.
We met a few months back
at the Young Republicans Club
and I thought she was normal
Then I don't know where she became this
candle burning, chanting Buddhist.
You met her in Hitler Youth camp
and you thought she was normal?
What in God's name were you doing
there in the first place?
I'm a Republican.
You're kidding, right?
If I am, it's not very funny is it?
I'm, I'm completely lost.
Why would a straight Republican ...
write a book about homosexuality?
To provide an objective source material
that doesn't indulge in proselytizing.
You're so stoned.
I am not.
Come in!
You want a shotgun?
A what?
Come here, open your mouth.
You should ... I think you should probably go...
Yeah, yeah, Ok.
I'm sorry. I, uh ...
Hey, sweetie!
How's your big night?
I won't ask you how big, how many times ...
Does he has a twin brother?
God, I won't ask, I have my pride.
Oh, forget it, it was a disaster.
- What's the matter? Is he bottom too?
- Worst.
- Is he straight?
- Yeah, but even worse.
Oh my God!
What can be worse than straight?
He is Republican.
He's a straight Republican!
Do you know any other kinds?
I--I'm sorry honey, but when he first opened his mouth,
Judy Garlands first fell out!
Oh, I'm, I'm  sorry sweetie,
I didn't ....
realize ... It's tough break.
God, how I wish they made cards
for moments like these.
You want a massage?
Thanks you but no.
I have to get to a rally.
Have fun!

Here sign mine. It's in support of Nixon.
Okay, now that I can sign?

That's not a prefix! Son of a bitch!
Sir!
So what are you doing here?
I-I jog here every morning.
- Getting many signatures?
- Not really.
Hah! Nixon's won. Ahaha!
Do you have plans tonight?
Or maybe you're busy
bringing down the government?
No! No, I'm not too busy. Why?
Well, it's Saturday and I used to spend them
with Beverly until you scared her away. So ...
I scared her away?
Yeah.
And you'd like to thank me with ... dinner?
Sure!
Alright!
I can't remember the last
time I had that much fun.
You're a Republican,
you never had that much fun.
I don't know. Some of those
upper people can get really rowdy.
- Is this my plant?
- Yeah!
What happened? You know you're
supposed to talk to it twice a day ...
Hi, plant.
Hi, plant.
Aww!
Well, I'm pretty wrecked,
so I'm gonna stubble home.
No! Why don't you stay the night.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah!
I can take the couch.
No. You don't have to do that.
I don't?
That couch is a torture device
for unwelcome relatives.
You sleep in my bed ...
- You sure?
- Sure I'm sure.
Alright.
I'll take the couch, I'm used to it.
Ok ... good night.
What are you doing?
The--The couch was worse than I remembered.
I'll take the couch.
Good morning!
Oh, I get breakfast too?
Usually all I get is a phoney name
and number.
Ahah! Last night was a blast, thanks!
Yeah, I had a good time too.
Well, you need to cool the charge zone ...
I need to save some of my brain cells for retirement.
So what are you doing tonight?
I can't see you again.
Here!
Oh, you're supposed to catch that.
I said I can't see you again.
Why?
Because I have feelings for you.
I think you know that.
But you climbed into bed with me anyway.
Come on!
"Dude, I was so drunk I don't remember a thing."
"Man I'm real horny right now, I wish
my girlfriend was here."
I don't know what you're talking about.
You know damn well
what I'm talking about.
I don't want you to be with me
because of some drunken encounter.
Well, I'm not a fag like you, ok?
Well, I'm so happy for you.

- Hello!
- Tommy?
Look, he doesn't want to talk to you.
Why don't you get out the white page
and call someone else?
   [TYPEWRITER CLANKING]
The American Psychiatric Association classifies
homosexuality as a mental illness.
I need your signatures to change that!
Homosexuality is not
a mental illness.
You should be ashamed!
You should be ashamed of that outfit!
Homosexuality is not a mental illness, sir.
Please brother! [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
Walk nice!
Can I just talk to him for
a second, please?
Listen, I put a restraining order on a guy
who didn't call half this much.
Faggot!
Alan, it's a potential two-book deal,
how could you resist?
I don't know. I just don't feel
good about it anymore.
The best thing is to get it out of your hands
and and out of your mind.
You sign right here and then we're done.
I've known Larry for a long time.
Trust me, your book
is in best of hands.
I guess your right.
Thanks for putting a good word for me
with Governor Reagan.
I think it's gonna be a good article.
Well, listen,
If there's ever anything I can do for you,
just give me a call.
Thank you, you've been a good friend.
[ KNOCKING]
Oh, excuse me.
What part of "fuck off, drop-dead, go to hell,
you're not getting a Christmas card" do you not understand, huh?
Why do you keep calling me?
I do not want to see you
or hear from you again!
I think I'll be going.
- Tommy, what a surprise to see you here!
- I'll talk to you later, Alan.
What do you want?
I can't stop thinking about what happened.
I just want to apologize for the way I treated you.
- I ... I finished my book. Peter's ...
- I don't give a fuck about the book!
What ... do you ... want?
I wanna say I'm sorry.
Absolution granted, go with with God.
We're done.
- Wait!
- What?
I wanted to tell you that ...
I-I ...
- Did you take the little bus to school?
- Spit it out! Say it!
I'm out of here!
I'll let you get back to crying
over Spiro Agnew's resignation.
That's not gonna happen...
Cause I hate you.
Now, fuck off!
Dude I was so drunk,
I don't remember a thing.
Shut up.
Hey, Alan, it's me. Call me baby.
It's Dylan again. The guy keeps asking ...
Larry Jenkins.
Uh, Larry, this is Alan Oakley.
Well, hey, I was just, uhm,
getting ready to call you.
I want to talk to you about the book.
Yeah, Alan, I needed to talk to you too.
Listen, it's a great book
but the timing ... it is all wrong.
I don't think that this is
the good time to release it.
Oh, that is great.
Oh my God, this is so great.
Ah, this is going better than I expected.
Yeah, listen, I'll give you a call
when the next one is finished?
I look forward to that.
Ok, see you!
Hey!
Who was that?
Uh, it's my publisher.
They're not gonna publish my book.
Oh! I'm sorry!
I know how much that meant to you.
Ah, it's no big deal.
What are you talking about?
I didn't care for it that much anyway.
Look you worked so hard on it.
I don't understand how you
can dismiss it so easily?
Am I missing something?
Well, can I read it now?
I'd like to just forget about it.
Ok ...
This will cheer you up.
Uh, it's not my kind of read.
Read? Damn, you are new with this.
Well why don't you teach me something.
Okay ... lesson 1...
No ... stop!
I won't ...
- I'm coming!
- Not yet, not yet!
Come on Alan, don't keep your mother waiting!
You better  move on. Open up in there, boy!
Good morning!
You still in bed, mister?
It's 0900! Damn, that must be nice.
What, what are you doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be in Vegas?
You father wasn't winning
so we decided to leave early.
We thought we'd see you
before we drove back in San Diego.
Now, isn't the best time.
We only came over to see you.
God! You know I hate this city.
Can I just ... I'll give you a call later?
Don't be ridiculous.
Get up, get up!
My mom and dad are here!
Oh great! I can't wait to meet them.
Are you crazy? No way!
They'll freak if they saw you!
My! I didn't know I look
that bad in the morning?
Come on!
- What do you want me to do?
- Just hide in the closet!
You'll bury me in a crawlspace
before I get in a closet.
I'm an only child.
My parents expect twenty grandkids!
They cannot see you!
I'm guessing your parents can't see a lot of things.
I'm sick of being your dirty little secret.
We never go out. I never met any of your friends.
You don't want me answering the phone.
I'm sorry. I didn't realize.
Uhm ... this is my friend Tommy.
He stayed the night last night because...
He got kicked out of his apartment.
Your mom's not stupid.
She can see what's going on here.
My roommate had out-of-town guests.
Things got a little bit too crowded so Alan let me crashed here.
Yeah ...
And I told him:
I can take the couch.
But Alan being the righteous guy that he is,
said: No, no! You go ahead take the bed,
I'll take the couch.
Well, that was sweet of you.
Anyway, don't worry about the coffee.
I've got a pot going.
I'll let you two get dress.
I liked the hat.
Dress!
H-how was Vegas?
Vegas is full of drunks, partying
and gambling till dawn.
That's we first met actually.
The good old days!
I was a dancer at the Pink Flamingo
and Ted was on leave from the marines
He was so cute in his uniform.
You were a dancer in Vegas,
that's so cool!
Did you ever meet Ann Margret?
No, but I wore her pantyhose.
The girls and I were doing a tribute to Elvis ...
Mary!
So how do the two of you know each other?
Uhm ... the Young Republicans Club.
Me, I just love Dick.
It has so much sugar.
Nixon's a fine man.
Glad to see young minds
supporting the team.
although he's a little too
liberal on some issues.
All in all, he's a fine man.
So Alan, do you have something
you want to tell us?
Uhm, I don't think so.
Might I be reading some new item soon?
I can explain it.
I think you should.
I think you owe your mother an explanation.
It was a  ...
Your father wants to know
when your book is coming out.
Oh! T-t-the book?
Uhm ... I--I haven't heard back from them yet, so ...
You haven't heard?
Well get your ass in gear!
- Ted!
- I mean, make some calls!
Use, you know, knock down ...
Use some initiative for once!
Ted, we need to be getting home.
Your father doesn't want to miss Kojak.
Who loves you, baby?
Well, you two have a safe trip back.
Yeah, and keep us posted for a change, huh.
It was nice meeting you, Tommy.
It was nice meeting you.
Oh! Your magazine was getting wet,
so I put it on the side of the couch for you.
I think they liked me.
Oh my God!
And what's the deal with your book?
I thought you said your publisher didn't like it.
I only told them that so they'll stay off my back.
I can't believe you left your porno magazine,
now my mother saw it!
Well, I wasn't the one who got it wet...
You little shit!
Closet case.

I mean, we haven't taken a vacation
in the four years that we've been together.
Mexico? You know I hate road trips.
Why don't we fly there instead.
If we fly there, it's not the same thing. I mean ...
it's about bonding on the road,

Oh no! Come on! Come on! Come on!

I think we found the perfect time to release your book.
Larry, I don't want anything
to do with that book.
That was a long time ago
and I don't believe in that anymore.
Certainly I don't want my name
attached to something like that.
- Alan, your making a big mistake.
- No. It was good seeing you.
Quite the turnout! You're popular.
They're mostly Tommy's friends.
Thanks again for doing this for us.
It's my pleasure. Oh, before I forget...
Here are the house keys to the place.
And I thank you for housesitting for me.
It's not a problem.
Tommy and I are looking forward to it.

Oh! W-what does he look like?
Well ... he's handsome, smart,

Hmm ... why would you let
someone like that out of your sight?
Well, in case I find someone better.
Oh, shit!

Yeah! Do you like secrets?
Have a sit.

No peeking.
Ok. Happy anniversary!

Too pretentious to buy me
a picture of a Volkswagen?
Haha!
It is also yours and arrives next week.

No! No, no! I can't accept this.
You have no choice! It's bought and
paid for,  and there are no refunds.
Look, it's for both of us.
No.

Do you have any idea
how much I love you?
Why don't you show me.
How could you do this to me?
Alan, you signed a contract with me
4 years ago. This was all perfectly legal.
The timing was just too perfect to let it
pass and I didn't attach your name to it.
So what are you worried about?

"Prior to this vote, singer Anita Bryant

"... against the ordinance which

"Following the overturning of the law,

Tell him I wrote the nation's number
one hate book? I can't do that.
Well, I suppose the whole thing might blow over
and no one will ever know that it was you.
But don't you think it's better to be honest?
Can't you get Larry to pull
the books off the shelves?
You got to face up to this, Alan.
You're right.
Just talk to him. He'll understand.
I hope so. Thanks.
Where is it?
There it is.
Gonna wish me luck?
Uhm, I need to tell you something.
What?
What is it?
Knock 'em dead.
Thanks! See you tonight.
The Anita Bryant-led effort to rescind
equal rights for gay people in Florida ...
... has spread nationally.
We're sitting here with Tommy Ballenger
of Out Loud, a group he founded ...
in order to prevent the Bryant crusade
from taking root in California.
Mr. Ballenger,
What does Out Loud plan to do about all of the
anti-gay rights bills being passed around the country?
Well, I think the best thing that Out Loud can do
is to educate everyone about diversity.
The people fear what they don't understand.
Have you read the book "The Straight Truth"?
It was obviously written by the Christian
right in an  attempt to make us look bad.
Why do you think it was published anonymously?
Any final words?
Yes, yes. Thank you.
I'd like to make a deal with the
Anita Bryant people.
If you stop telling lies about us,
we'll stop telling the truth about you.
You may have heard that there was an incident
during a pre-concert meeting with reporters.
And this is what happened:
"We brought a crusade across the nation and
try to do away with the homosexuals"
"Then certainly we could done on June 8
after one of the most overwhelming victories in the country."
"Uhm ... uh, but we didn't ...  we ... we tried to avoid it
and went into a place called Norfolk, Virginia"
"And we're met with protests"
"and uh, all kinds of problems ...
and uh ... uh ...
"Security! Security!"
- No, no! Let him stay.
- No. Well at least it's a fruit pie.
Yes, I would like to give you the name
of the author of "The Straight Truth"...
and I wished to remain anonymous.
Mr. Ballenger, it's been revealed that the
author of the book "The Straight Truth" is Alan Oakley,
a man you been living with the past four years.
Would you care to comment
on these allegations?
Was this a plan to make money out of
the controversy Anita Bryant has caused?
Was this a hoax designed
to look like a right-wing attack ...
in order to garner sympathy for your cause?
Give us the straight truth, Mr. Ballenger:
Is Alan Oakley actually your lover?
Oh come one!
People wanted to know the truth!
Listen. You Farrah Fawcett major asshole!
If you don't haul your twack out of here
I swear to God,
I'm shoving that microphone so far up ...
Oh!
Uh! The hair is all wrong, honey!
Cut!
There isn't a newspaper in the country,
except maybe a gossip rag ...
that would employ a journalist who's
the subject of more news than he writes.
It--it wasn't supposed to be published.
A real journalist would never write
anything that can't be published!
A real writer takes responsibility
for his words!
Even your father agrees with me on this.
You have created...
an environment of anarchy around here.
We have protestors outside
in front of the building!
The phones they are ringing off
the hook with death threats!
I have no choice, Alan, but to let you go.
Is there anything you want to say?
I'm sorry.

What's up?
A phone number and address in Mexico.
Let me guess ...
My dream man will be there.
Beverly I know you are excited of this idea
of psychics on infomercials ...
... but let me be the first to tell you,
it won't catch on.
It's Tommy's address and phone number.
Come on!
You're making things right with the gay community,
make thing right with him too!
He hates me.
You're the only one who hates you.
I can't. I have ... I have
to prepare for my speech ...
and I think Peter's planning
something for my birthday.
He's sick, Alan.
Michael asked me to tell you. He thought
it would be easier coming from me.
He's going to his parents' house the day after
tomorrow and he wants to see you before he leaves.
No, I can't.
I have to get home.
Home to what?
Alan!
Mary! Hi, it's Beverly.
Look, we need to help your son.
Oh! So you are a dyke!
I have an idea.
Alright sister!
You coming to bed?
In a minute.
That damn construction crew ...
they won't be finished putting up
the new gates until Tuesday.
I wanted them to finish before
my parents come tomorrow!
- Your parents are coming tomorrow?
- Yeah ...
so you have to move all your stuff
into one of the spare rooms while they're here.
Oh, I got you a new suit to wear.
It's hanging in your closet.
I'm going to bed. Good night.
[SNORING]
What is this?
It's the keys to my BMW. It's all yours.
I'm buying a new one.
Stop with the gifts, Ok?
I'm perfectly happy with my car.
Alan, it's a Honda.
How can you be happy with that?
We are not doing that great, are we?
What, are you kidding?
I'm never been better!
- The firm has only lost one case this year ...
- I'm talking about us, Peter!
We've grown apart.
I'll take you to Cabo as soon as I get some time.
I don't think that's
the answer to our problem.
Ha!
I can't believe this second-rate law firm
is getting so much work.
Hi, plant!
Dad, you two should take
a trip to China...
for your 60th anniversary.
- What?
- China, dad!
I don't care what we eat
Just don't let that woman of yours
cook any more of that damn roast!
This is Peter, not Martin.
Peter isn't married. Remember, George.
Why aren't you married?
Because he's too busy with work.
He doesn't have time to date.
Oh, Alan, we haven't seen your lady friend
that Peter has been telling us that much.
We'll she's too busy with work.
Which she's got President Reagan
to thank for that!
Oh, we have President Reagan
to thank for a lot of things.
I'll get it.
He's a nice young man.
Surprise!
- What is this?
- Happy birthday!
This is not a good time.
What's that dreary music?
I've been in elevators with better
music than this.
It's your birthday so ...
we decided to come over
and party.
Mwah!
Oh that's B.S.! We're here for the free liquor.
Your mother is single and ready to party.
Mom!
This is how we used to do it for
the after hour show at Caesar's Palace.
You go, Mama!
Peter's parents are here!
Wheel them out, then!
Let's do this at another time, please?
I can't believe invited them and not us!
You are a bad boy.
Yeah, go to your room, now.
Guys ...
We got to talk!
Mom, do not touch a thing ...
I thought Peter might appreciate it.
If Peter needed a hooker.
Oh, come on! I might a
little extra cash on my way home.
What's up?
Why haven't you called your mother?
You do realize your parents just got divorced.
Yeah, well, she looks she's fine to me.
Your real birthday present.
I thought you might need a little vacation.
- I told you,  I can't.
- Your plane leaves in 3 hours.
You'll make it to Mexico and
enough time to sip on a margarita ...
and catch that flight with Tommy to Texas.
- I can't go.
- Why?
Because Peter wouldn't like that.
"Peter wouldn't like that."
Beverly!
Alan! Peter wouldn't like even if
I sat on his face and grind it!
Come on! Jump off his nip ... for a change!
He took me when no one else would, Ok?
He's a little baby
He's Peter's boobooboo ...
I said I can't go.
Grow up and be a man.
Keep it! You might change your mind!
What is that racket?
Sounds like a bunch of colors!
I will go and see what is going on.
- Is he working?
- He's not budging.
The night's still young!
Come on. Not tonight.
Come on, join us!
Don't be such a square.
He's just like his father.
I didn't raise him like that.
[ CRASHING SOUND]
I hope that wasn't expensive!
It was!
I told them they couldn't stay.
I can't believe you invited
your parents for his birthday but not us.
It's your birthday?
Well then, I came just in time.
What's for dinner, anyway?
- We don't have enough.
- Oh, knowing you, you have more than you need.
Why do you keep looking at your watch?
That was a terrific meal.
You know how to cook, Alan.
Thanks.
Wine! Yes, please.
I'll have another.
Could you be anymore of an alcoholic?
Well, I'll give it a shot,
but I'm not making any promises.
Are you ready for your
big speech tomorrow night?
Oh! How exciting!
Practice on us!
- So, dad, how was your golf game ...
- He's giving a speech ...
on Reagan's neglect of the health crisis.
You should be proud, Peter.
Could we not make this dinner table
conversation tonight?
Where is Alan's father?
Probably screwing some young tramp.
I should have left him years ago ...
but he was just so good in bed!
Some days I can barely walk.
No one here is interested in that.
Lower your voice!
We are not hard of hearing.
Well, you could at least take
some interest in my son's well-being!
I respect all of Alan's interests,
I just don't like having them
shoved down my throat!
That's the first time I heard you complained
about my son shoving anything down your throat.
I'm not quite sure how to take that ...
Hmm ... said the altar boy to the bishop.
You're way out of line.
First you come into my house ...
- Your house?
- ... uninvited ...
Oh, I forgot. You live alone.
Don't do this.
Don't make the same mistakes...
I made with your father.
I love you and I support you ...
But I can't sit here and
watch you destroy your life.
If you leave right now, you'll make it in time.
In time for what? He's not going anywhere.
This dinner is over.
I want everyone out of here now!
You don't have to shout.
- Let's go, George.
- You don't have to shout.
Take your cane.
Did we say something wrong?
I hope you enjoyed embarrassing me.
What are you doing?
I'm leaving you.
Is there some problem I'm not aware off?
No, there is a problem you've been ignoring.
We don't belong together, Peter.
Let's discuss this tomorrow.
Peter, I am leaving you and
I am not coming back.
Where are you gonna go?
I'm going to see Tommy.
Tommy who?
Tommy Ballenger.
What?
You want to spend your life with him
on--on picket lines,
throwing condoms in churches
and screaming about how dire everything is?
Why do you think I saved you from
that in the first place?
How did you save me?
If I hadn't pushed Larry
to get your book published ...
that's the life that you would
be leading right now.
- You got that book published?
- Of course, I did!
You fucking asshole!
You had the opportunity for success.
And what did you do?
You threw it all away. You wasted your life.
That book destroyed my life!
What turned you into this monster?
I didn't change, you did.
Now put the bags down and
get back upstairs.
Hmm ...
What happened to my gate opener?
I have it.
Could you open it for me?
Alan, it's cold out here.
Now will you come on?
Then go somewhere warmer like to hell.
I got a plane to catch.
Peter, dammit!
For the last time, open the gates!
Did the party moved out here?
Could you talk some sense into your son?
Hey son! I'm supposed
to talk some sense into you.
Mom, I need to get out of here.
Makes sense to me.
Take care of yourself and
give my love to Tommy.
- What's all the ruckus out here?
- It's okay, Dad.
Will you open those gates?
You are not helping the situation.
Where is he going?
He's getting the hell out of here!
What brook's place is everyone's yelling for?
Will you open that gate?
It's time for you to go home.
Aww! What are you doing?
Let him out!
C'mon. Give me that!
No! That's my grandmother's!
Laid it herself, I bet!
Don't make me kick your ass!
Oh no, not that.
