ENGLISH SUBTITLES BY : PRIMITIVE_MAN
SPRING 1986
Hello, Jacques. How are you?
Dish of the day?
Yes, I am starving.
Glass of red?
I can't drink whilst on duty
Make it a small beer.
Beer...
-Jacques, Sorry I'll have to cancel my order!
Ok?
Ruben! Ruben!
-Have you seen the paper?
-Which paper?
-oh!
What is it?
I'm busy, Vanuxem.
-They're closing us! Read this!
CUSTOMS TO CLOSE!
In 7 years we're done!
No - NO!!!!!
SEVEN YEARS LATER
HAPPY NEW YEAR 1993
-- ANYTHING TO DECLARE --
Hands up, Dirty Bastard.
On the ground, Motherfucker.
Don't shoot!
Ruben!
You were sleeping on the job!
Idiot. You scared me to death.
I must report this.
I wasn't asleep..
Yes, you were.
No.
What were you doing?
I was... thinking.
With your eyes closed, drooling?
-I think deeply!
Do you take me for a fool?
There's no one around. Except you..
Why are you here?
Can't sleep at home?
I fell asleep for 2 minutes.
The place is dead. Coffee
''The place is dead''?
''The place is dead''?
Come with me... Come with me!
What is this?
The road.
No, here. What is this?
A yellow stripe.
-It's not just 'A yellow stripe.'?
For this line, the great patriots
history.
With their tears and blood and lives
they protected our country.
This is not simply 'a yellow stripe.'
With body, soul,
and loyalty....
...with force and determination,
brutal attacks have been repulsed.
French people who were out on the harvest ...
... houses were raped and
women set on fire!
No, reverse that.. And right here, here,
here they stopped.
this insignificant place, yes
sanctified to the Belgian kingdom.
So you see. This line is important.
Here men fell, heads high.
Sorry to correct you ...but here, heroes died.
So, excuse me..
but yes, this is a place of death.
and I care!
My apologies, I was wrong. My apologies.
You're very tense lately!
I accept your apology.
Now with Operation Uppercut.
Right now?
Yes, right now.
I've just finished a night shift.
Given that string of saliva on your jacket.
I think..you've had enough rest!
Forward with Uppercut.
Go ahead!
I've moved 500 metres in 30 minutes!
-Calm down, sir.
The border is not open?
-Not til the 1st of January.
Some of us have to work
-Yeah, yeah.
You, here.
What's going on?
-Vandevoorde!
Harrassing people right to the end, huh?
Where is everyone?
Trade Union Meeting.
-Again?
We must have a strike!
A Massive strike!
Who is for?
We're only four people!
Five with the boss.
Are you for striking? Mathias?
Sure. ..I'm with you..
We're in agreement!
Yes, but...
...what do we do?
We block the border!
Stop all vehicles.
If we stop vehicles...
aren't we working?
Isn't that our job, huh?.
We'll let all vehicles through!
If we let all vehicles through...
..it's like we agree to open borders.
True.
I don't give a shit!
-Stop being so difficult, Greg.
Meeting is over, help Bakari.
She's busy. Go
What are you doing, Ducatel?
-Installing the new computer system
What system?
-A computer.
It arrived on Friday.
You're the first user.
This is the computer revolution.
What a mess. I can't see my desk.
Where's my typewriter?
You don't need one. The computer has a
word processor...
...which uses this cable to print,
automatically.
I liked my carbon paper, but still...
I discarded it.
You did what?
-You won't need it anymore.
Watch....
I type the report here
or the notes...
... And click 'print' ...
You know what I had to do for
a supply of carbon paper?
Look.
What is this crap?
A simple interface problem.
'Paper jam'. It says here.
Take your TV and Air conditioner,
and put everything back.
I've not finished...
I'll stick with my
Carbon Paper.
It's complicated enough
managing a customs office.
As you wish.
Now go and tell that Belgian
Vandevoorde that he must back down.
Not Vandevoorde.
-That's an order. Now!
Hi, honey. You okay?
I was talking about you, and my boss said,
"You've know each other show a year, huh?
Go see her. " And here I am.
And the real reason?
I must talk to your brother.
This traffic problem is his fault.
Be nice.
Will he be nice?
-Ask him for a drink, sometime.
We'll go together.
Then he'll see us together.
-When will tell my brother
about us?
Soon, baby.
There he is.
You scared the hell out of me, Louise.
I'd like a mixture of 300 grade.
Of everything.
Okay.
Put it aside?
See you soon.
It's a ridiculous offer. Half of
what we paid eight years ago.
It's the best offer in months, Mme Lanus.
It's 'Janus', with a 'J'.
You, yourself sold it to us.
-This is a goldmine.
'It was', M. Janus, 'It was'.
As of January 1...
..the border will be open,
and who'll stop then?
We'll work it out. We serve good drink,
have good sales, and five percent.
Whatever!
We have wasted enough time with you
What do we do now?
We sell it to a jerk who
doesn't know the euro.
Someone like you!
Someone who doesn't read newspapers,
just watches TV and still doesn't understand.
A fool who doesn't think too fast.
Vanuxem, search this...
What!
Hello...
About this congestion...
My boss is going to call your boss
...if you don't speed
up the traffic flow.
I cannot hear you in that uniform.
Look, I thought I'd just give you
a friendly heads-up
Is that a threat?
-No, a simple warning.
Piss Off!
Ruben Vandevoorde, damn it.
Be reasonable for once.
Take the piss out of my accent again
and I'll kick your ass.!
-I did no such thing!
-oh no? ''Once'' !
That's not a Belgian accent!
Here's a Belgian accent.
You French think you're so superior.
-I am a superior
Just kidding. Calm down, Ruben.
I have to go.
Back to your own country.
What did he want?
The congestion lifted!
The French are as bad
as drug traffickers.
Often, they are one and the same...
Should we transport it in two lots,
Mr. Duvall...
...It's a lot
It's the last job of the year
...and what then?
Mobile Customs?
That's the problem.
Tiburce is your guy
reliable?
It cannot go wrong.
Bullet? He beats everything.
Hence the name.
Firstclass ex-prisoner. Right?
Yeah ...
Good, let's go over it...
You arrive at customs,
and what do you do?
I'm going with flashing lights across the border.
And if they stop you?
I'll say that I'm transporting injured..
I am in a hurry. There is danger.
And?
And?
That's all, isn't it?
No, fucking idiot. Most importantly:
look innocent.
Sorry, Mr. Duval. I'll look innocent.
-Let's see it.
-What?
Look innocent, you moron.
Like this?
What the hell is that?
You look like an imbecile!
Sorry, Mr Duvall - I don't know how to look
innocent...
I have always been guilty.
Always have been.
You must seem cool...
... But alert.
Cool, but alert.
Not too cool. That is suspicious.
Not too alert, which is
suspect. Understand?
Yes, I get it.
Look at me. Like this.
Yes, that's good.
Like this..?
It might be better if you don't stop.
What are you doing?
What?
Where is the 'U'?
The Who?
The 'U'.
What do you mean 'U'?
Can you read, Bullet?
Yes.
'Yes' - Where is the U of 'Ambulance', Moron?
There's a U in 'amblance'?
Say that again?
Amblance.
-Yes. Amblance...
Isn't this the way to spell it?
"Isn't this the way to spell it?"
''The Bullet'' !
AmBUlance !
B-U ! B-U ! B-U, look!
Two 'BU'?
Not two. One!
Ambubulance ?
Come here.
There's a U in ''Ambulance'' !
Am-BU-lance, Moron!
Unbelievable!
Do not tell mama
I brought you..
It's a secret between you
and dad. OK?
-Why are we move this board?
- Because ... It's no ordinary board.
..These signs indicate
the border between countries.
Watch closely.
In which country am I?
Belgium.
And that is?
-The best country.
Now, in what country?
-France.
This is the land of...
-Complete idiots.
Leo ...
In which country is Papa now?
In Belgium.
Yes, you get it. Very simple.
We've increased Belgiums size!
That's genius, Dad.
No, Leo. We taking back
what's ours!
The great kingdom of Belgium...
..once extended 200 kilometers
further, to Reims!
When was that?
Third century, and it was called
Belgica Secunda.
-You know why you're
named Leopold?
In honor of Leopold I, first king
the Belgians, June 26, 1841.
No, 1831.
-1831, sorry, dad.
That's ok.
Tell me.
What was the biggest blunder
of King Leopold I?
He married a French woman,
daughter of Louis Philippe.
..Just another stupid French person..
-Exactly.
I'm impressed.
You are your fathers son!
And heaven? Is it Belgian or French?
-Belgian.
-Everything good is from Belgium.
The border goes straight up.
Err... Are the stars of Belgium?
-Naturally.
But the earth rotates.
If the stars are above France,
they are French.
No. Stars can travel abroad,
but they come back to Belgium.
They run around the earth during the day,
At night they sleep here.
What are you doing?
Protecting the moon...
..as she sleeps with us.
The future is not known,
but your dad will protect you.
Lord ...
... Ensure the independence of Belgium
and its sovereign will...
... And that Europe is never united.
Never!!!
Pardon.
Please also protect
my whole family. Amen.
Oh yes. Lord, I also pray...
...that my sister finally finds
a good man..
A good Belgian, of course! Hmm?
You're doing me a great honour.
Taking me out in public.
I am very happy.
Me too.
Wait here, I'll take a look.
If I'm not back in 5 min, join me...ok?
What are you looking for?
-Whether the coast is clear.
-oh no, Mathias...no...
It's ok....
Mathias!
Good evening.
Mr. Ducatel.
Come with me.
Take a seat please, Sir.
Mathias!
Mathias!
Mathias Ducatel ...
Jacques...
-We had the same idea!
You okay?
Do not worry. If you say nothing
to my wife, I am discreet.
Very nice of you.
No, you know. It works both ways!
Do you have another table?
You wanted romantic.
This is much more romantic.
You're alone?
Of course not...
You cannot be romantic on your own!
Here she comes.
What are you doing?
I wouldn't want to sit too close...
People might get the wrong idea!
Stop it. Come here, Louise.
-The menu.
Call me when you're ready.
How brave. I'm impressed.
Sorry I let you down. I'm Stupid.
You do everything by halves.
You make decisions but don't act.
I will act.
oh yeah? Prove it!
Honey, what are you doing?
Louise Vandevoorde,
will you be my wife?
Oh, my God...
You're fixing your shoes?
No.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
And?
You've asked my father?
No.
My brother?
No.
What then?
-We elope.
It's my family.
Your family decides?
-That's not it.
What then?
I cannot walk away from my family.
I'll talk to your father.
Is it yes or no?
Please...
Yes.
Yes? Are we ...
Yes
I love you.
I love you too.
That's Ruben Vandevoordes
beautiful sister!
What is it?
I heard something. There is someone.
What?
A Frenchman.
You hear something. Not French.
A French sound.
Ruben, You'll wake Leopold. Lie down.
Are you hungry, Ruben?
We will eat when nobody wants
to get into Belgium.
Excuse me? I would like to pass.
Just here to there to refuel.
Do we Belgians go
to France to refuel?
No, it's more expensive..
Pricier then in Belgium?
-Sure.
Why, 'Sure'?
You claim that your service is better!
With us there is more tax.
So it's cheaper for you.
..Our Belgian petrol
is cheaper in Belgium...
..for us.. Now get out.
You have no right to speak
to me like that!
I'm here to prevent French parasites
from entering Belgium. Go!
I have the right to enter Belgium.
I will fill up.
Assault!
Freeze!
Assaulting a customs
official is a crime!
Vanuxem, cuff him.
Eat Tarmac!
Can we go?
-In a moment.
When are we going to eat?
Let's see what he's got...
There is something in there?
Bend over.
Not in my slip. No, please.
Ruben!
Perhaps it's the cuffs.
Really? You think so?
Indeed.
Unbelievable. See this?
Good detector. Is it Belgian?
No, Chinese.
Here's the Chief!
It's okay. You can go.
Vandevoorde, you're responsible
for that monstrous traffic jam?
Traffic jam?
-What's this man here for?
Him? He's a suspect.
-Suspected of what?
Chief, he was in his underwear.
-Liar!
You forced me to undress!
Me? Absolutely not.
What has this man done
to be treated like this?
Is he French?
-No, I do not believe so.
Yes, I am French.
-I did not know. How nice!
To my Office!
Sorry!
In the European Union your
anti-French attitude is a problem.
Anti-French, me?
No, I Love France!
-That's not the view of everyone.
Cool it! You have a bad reputation.
How can that be?
I am the most francophile Belgian.
Francophile are you?
-I love France's beautiful country...
Good for you.
You're to be part of a
mixed Mobile Customs Unit.
Man-woman?
-Franco-Belgian.
Great idea, chief.
No, a brilliant idea!
Not for me. I can not.
That is beyond me.
No, boss, please. No.
Then, you must leave..
..those are your only choices.
I'm sorry.
To the future of
computer experts.
Computer Expert.
Is the same.
Two daily specials, and we are in a hurry.
I'm going to miss him.
Mme Janus, have a drink?
No, not me.
I do not drink champagne
to the disappearance of Customs.
I'd rather drink poison.
-Don't take it so hard.
How do I go on?
You are civil servants ...
..but we must continue.
Our revenue declines.
What do we do without Customs?
No Customs, no one stops.
With one currency, no exchange.
What I said?
We had not thought that far.
It's lunch time. We usually have
thirty customers, and now?
It is empty.
Yes, definitely.
Irene, I promise that the customs officers
who stay will eat dinner here everyday.
Promised.
You can trust us.
We tell it everywhere, even in Belgium.
We'll save it yet ...
Thanks.
Jacques!!
Yes, my little baby?
The lady and gentlemen are lunching here.
I'll find them a spot.
Hurry up.
What I get tired of that shithead...
This is the plate of the day?
-We have to economize.
You see what a joke Europe is?
He looks unhappy.
He's married to a french woman!
So he's 'Belgian Unhappy.'
He is despised by is wife -
The Frenchman at is best.
That's his misfortune.
A Frenchman asks a
Belgian customs officer:
"Would you check my indicators? "
"Of course, with pleasure."
So the Frenchman turns them on.
The Belgian walks round the
car checking.
"Yes, it does. No, it doesn't"
"Yes, it does. No, it doesn't"
"Yes, it does. No, it doesn't"
Do you know why the French
are fond of Belgian jokes?
They have three times to laugh.
When you tell it, when you explain it,
and when they set out to understand it!
Let's go.
We haven't eaten.
It smells like Frenchmen!
Hey, Vanuxem. Come on.
I am innocent.
Innocent, innocent ...
Makes you wonder
doesn't it... if Vandevoorde...?
He'll let a Belgian ambulance through?
I bet you fifty Francs not.
Customs. Kingdom of Belgium.
Papers.
Where are you going?
I'm transporting seriously injured
for an urgent transplant.
It's a matter of life or death.
Are you laughing at me?
No.
Yes.
No.
Yes, you laugh.
I try to stay cool,
but I'm tense.
Hands on the wheel.
Do they normally transport
the body?
No, it depends.
On what?
On the organs.
You have French papers,
but your car is Belgian.
I am French. I work in Belgium.
You steal bread in Belgium.
I do not eat bread, I'm on a diet.
A joker.
Ruben. Come look.
Do not move.
You see, it's without a "U" !
Get out.
Hit the gas!
Hit the gas!
Get out. Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Accelerate!
Wait, wait ...
Freeze!
What are you doing?
You like to do drugs.
Calm down, Vandevoorde.
Here you have nothing to say.
Customs? French people who do it.
-I'm not excited.
You should try getting angry.
I like to see you wild - weakling!
Don't insult me!
You're a weakling,
a little weakling.
Go away or I'll arrest you.
On what grounds?
-You've come across the border with drugs!
Stupid shithead...
Sorry, that was an accident.
!! Vandevoorde !!
Nice punch. He deserved that!
He's getting even dumber.
-He out there. alright!
Come on.
Tell me you didn't hit him...
-Sorry. He insulted me.
This can't go on. Grow up.
I said, I'm sorry.
You're making excuses!
Are you kidding?
Doing it before talking to my dad...?
He's screwed up our lives for a year.
Should I apologize?
You ...
What have I done wrong?
I'm from the other side
of the border. He can go to hell.
A stupid comment.
I'm not stupid.
Your brother is stupid.
A stupid Belgian.
Do not say that.
He's just a stupid Belgian.
You are racist.
Of course not. This makes me mad.
Sometimes I can't stand it.
Why are we together?
-Sometimes I wonder that too.
I hate you.
Wait... Louise.
-Get off me.
See? Just like your brother.
Same Belgian attitude.
What about it?
All stupid.
Wait, Louise!
You're on something. I feel it.
I'm so ashamed, father.
Fear not. The Lord guides
the straying sheep.
Even if I shot a Frenchman?
You shot a Frenchman?
It is not the shooting itself, but
when I hit him and he fell ...
...I felt a great... satisfaction.
A kind of joy.
A kind of ecstasy.
That's evil father.
Heaven, where does this absurd
French hatred come from?
Father ...
Yes, my son?
No, It comes from my father.
Love your neighbor as yourself.
God has commanded.
I know, father.
But if my neighbor is French...
...I cannot. Physically impossible.
If your hate persists ...
... I cannot give you absolution,
For you do not show contrition in confession.
I'm really sorry.
-You'll go straight to hell. Forever.
I go to hell forever?
-You may not pass through the Customs of Paradise.
Can I never enter paradise?
-Sure.
But - With such a sinful soul
you cannot.
Damn...
Attention, Gentlemen.
Miss!
-Excuse me, Bakari.
Go ahead.
We're listening, Vandevoorde.
Well...
I am genuinely sorry
about what happened.
I went too far.
I was wrong. I should
not have insulted you.
I was not thinking clearly.
Excuse me.
I am also sorry. My apologies.
No problem.
Good. Incident handled.
Now the Mobile Customs Team.
We need a volunteer
for a French-Belgian team.
Who?
Pardon?
Which Belgian officer?
Me.
Enough already. Which of you?
Is this a joke?
-Not at all.
Nobody will volunteer.
I'm available. - I Volunteer
Seriously.
Put me down on the team
with Ruben Vandevoorde.
You are going to Paris
that IT stuff?
I've changed my mind.
OK, then you begin
next Monday.
Report at 9 AM here for the briefing.
Why not in Belgium?
It can alternate!
-Complicated. Easier to do it here.
In No Man's Land then - which is neutral.
-OK, No Man's Land.
And this is the dining room.
-With room for sixty.
What are they doing now?
-It's a Meeting.
Customs meetings,
and no one orders anything?
But you always say yes.
No.
-Except to me.
Want to see the apartment?
We know that the removal of Customs
will lead to more drug traffic.
We share the responsibility.
You'll be alone in the field.
No assistance.
Believe me, it's a new game.
What is that?
Mobile phone. This first is for you.
See how small it is?
Very small. Great.
Use sparingly.
It costs a fortune to use.
Your training will cost 40,000 Belgian francs.
-That 5,900 French francs.
Is that all?
-Yes.
One weeks training, which will not take place.
-Why?
We had to purchase an emergency vehicle
with the budget.
For 5,900 Francs? What kind of vehicle?
What is that?
Ridiculous.
The third member of the team,
- Grizzly.
What do we do with such a monster?
-He's one of our best drug agents.
This?
-To protect us?
Protection, No.
Grizzlys superb at drug detection.
He'll assist you in your work.
To the car, gentlemen.
Your work must exemplify
international cooperation.
Count on us.
-To the Europe of tomorrow.
This is getting good.
Stop that, please.
Sorry.
Get back!
Off.
He seems very stupid, that dog.
Must be French.
He seems to like Belgians.
Just kidding...
Why didn't he stop?
-We're not Customs...
...And look like clowns.
They thought we were waving.
What?
-What the hell am I doing here?
The world is changing, and we follow.
No, that's different.
The world is broken, and so are we...
We have a 'Stop' sign.
Have you broken down?
-Border Patrol, sir.
Really?
-Why, "really?"
It looks like you've broken down,
or are lost.
We are Customs
and at work.
Customs still exist?
-We are now mobile.
Now get out.
We'll prove Customs still exists.
Do not upset because he is French.
-He seems very French.
He's laughing in our faces.
-No, he asks if we still exist.
-I know I still exist,
but in this land - nothing!
Well... he's gone.
What are you doing!!
Do that again!
-Don't shoot.
He fleeing.
-You can't just shoot him.
OK. What do we do now, Mister Smartass?
-His registration record.
Or we go after them,
but we don't shoot.
We are now in France.
French laws, I decide.
I suggest: Following.
What do you think?
In that?
Are you upset, darling?
No, you know.
Your brother's got a nice fellow,
Vanuxem.
He's nice, but I'm looking for
someone I love.
I never see you with a man.
I must tell you something.
-What, you like women?
You're a dyke?
-You do not say 'dyke', but 'lesbian'.
You're a lesbian.
-I did not say that.
Why do you and
Vanuxem not...?
I do not feel like it.
-He's "mixed race", you know?
Flemish and Walloon. A true Belgian.
You're kidding me...
everything is about Belgium to you.
The true Belgian.
You're annoying. Pick
another subject.
What is it?
I saw the label. This water is French.
I just want Spa.
That is. Take this, it is fine.
-I want Belgian waters.
Pretend this is Belgian.
I am crazy about you.
I love you.
What is it?
I hear you beyond.
Your sister wants me drink French Water.
-Why buy it?
The water is fine.
-Tastes dirty.
Give him Belgian waters.
-Thanks, Ruben.
Let me taste.
You're right. Stingy.
With a dry finish.
Dry water? That's Logical!
You talk such drivel.
-Do not talk to me in that tone.
Apologies, great savior of the nation.
-What?
You're the great defender of Belgium,
until your last breath.
Stop it!
-No! I'm tired of your paranoia and racism.
Racism? Patriotism
Is not no racism, Daddy?
Of course not.
-Enough. Stop.
You know what you need?
A good man at home.
Vanuxem.
-Good idea.
That 's enough.
Where you going, sweetie?
-Home.
Italian coffee, coffee maker from Taiwan,
cups from Limoges.
Gingerbread from Belgium.
Hypocrites!
What do you want?
-I wanted to see you.
What are you doing with my brother?
-Trying make friends
Maybe then we can be happy.
Besides, we're not even get married.
Useless. All that time lost.
-Why?
You were right. My family is stupid,
but it's my family!
I'm so sorry..,
so sorry.
Louise, Louise...
-Please, Mathias.
My treasure ...
-You're Making it more difficult. Help me.
It's over. This is better.
You'd be very wise to buy.
It's a goldmine that runs effortlessly.
Right, Jacques?
If you look at sales figures,
huge!
Then why are you selling it?
My husband is very ill.
An incurable disease eats
him. Slowly but surely.
I must admit, I'm very sick.
...his illness ...
I mean,
he must take time to heal...
To rest and heal...
so that I have more
time for...
Some incurables...
do heal.
Hope springs eternal, they say.
Bullshit! I know
your situation.
But the customs come here every day.
Yeah, that interests me.
What do you mean?
I also run a trade
that suffers from a united Europe.
I transport in secret between borders.
Smuggling?
Call it that if you like. Nothing bad.
Hifi equipment, cigarettes ...
A little extra income.
Interested?
-We are honest.
I'll make you an offer.
We do not need you dirty money!
-Quiet, they'll hear you.
Do not look at them.
You don't need to smuggle.
Keep your ears open and find out
when Mobile Customs deploy.
We're not interested!
-How much is here?
Give the envelope back.
Keep it for the moment.
Serve Vanuxem.
-No way!
Nothing wrong.
I get in touch with you soon.
Get me that information,
or give the money back.
Think about it.
-I already have
I don't hate the French,
they make themselves hated.
You're right.
You agree?
Of course.
We are arrogant,
contemptuous, whiners ...
Exactly.
Take Belgian jokes.
They're insufferable.
Good Point.
-Why do my colleagues laugh at you?
They're idiots.
No - They're jealous.
Of what?
You're the best customs officer
on the Franco-Belgian border.
Yes.
You monitor the border by yourself.
They'll never reach your level,
So they laugh at you.
And you?
-Yes, They pick on their superiors.
This is a form of respect.
-Belgian jokes are respected?
Pure admiration.
Calling someone you admire?
Really! It's stupid...
Like your language.
It's French, but called Belgian.
Exactly.
Like... 'Belgian Franc' ... makes no sense.
Why not 'Belgar Dollar?'
What should I say?
...15 Belgians or 15 Belgars
Fifteen Belgars!
See!
Look, we take this Spike-Mat.
If a car drives over it,
it punctures the tires.
Customs.
Oh no.
Shit! Shit! Shit!
Shit! Shit! Shit!
That's the guy from the ambulance.
That we have.
A diesel van.
Hurry!
I didn't drive it over...?
Did I?
We're in the middle of nowhere!
What do we do?!
The mobile phone...
What?
The Mobile Phone.
Here...
Customs.
Vanuxem? It's Ruben.
Warn the boys,
the police.
There's a fleeing car.
A red van.
...carrying contraband.
Red, Registration ...
... 60 and 15.
We say 75.
From Anor direction Chimay.
I repeat ...
Are they coming out? Are they?
They are not.
Expensive and worthless!.
It's a failure,
a total failure.
This must stop.
Ir's ridiculous!
He's right. It doesn't work.
Nobody takes us seriously.
Abolishing Customs
was a folly!
A Strategic and economic failure.
And anti-Patriotic!
It's fucked up.
I'm sorry, but our report
is that this is unworkable!
Vandevoorde, a negative report
will not stop this, you know?
We could go on strike.
Absolutely.
Are you crazy? All the Customs Officers
together won't change this...
The Customs Border Post will finally disappear.
No matter what!
It's over.
Debriefing over.
Repair the car...
...at your own expense.
Goodbye, gentlemen.
Incredible! This is so over.
Ordered to the streets again. Abandoned.
Depressing!
-Let's have a goal in mind.
Who's the enemy?
-France?
No, those drug smugglers.
-and?
..And for January 1, we
pick those bastards up, eh?
The cars shit. We'd be faster on foot ...
-Maybe my brother can help.
Isn't he in jail?
-Not anymore.
A lot of work.
We only want new tires.
-maybe... rims.
We have very little money.
I do it for Bruno.
Tomorrow at a quarter past two
it'll be ready.
Come on, guys!
Hurry, hurry!
I feel like crying....
What is it?
I'd like to be mobile.
Working alone is boring.
You miss me, Vanuxem?
I found it fun when you shouted.
Now I'm bored stiff.
Take an afternoon nap.
You'll see me often.
You're my brother.
Is it the beer?
I choked.
You are brothers?
First let me see if I like your sister.
You're being picky?
She is beautiful, but...
Don't say anything nasty.
Are you two going out?
I'm thinking about it.
Excuse me...
You okay?
Fine. You?
-It's alright.
Where's Nadia?
-She working at Finance now.
She never even said goodbye.
-Lads...!
Will you join us for dinner?
The next time...
...You can simply say:
'I admire you.' OK?
No wonder you're jealous,
but jokes are unnecessary. Agreed?
Of course.
We will.
Three servings of stew.
A present for our French friends.
These are good portions.
Jacques has become generous?
Just a bit of meat
with a good sauce.
Mobile Customs works hard.
All day in the car?
No, we stick mainly to
the back roads.
Oh yeah?
Which country roads do you patrol?
He was hard but...
...Alpine engine, V6,
250 hp, 3 liters...
Top speed: 186 mph.
This is more than rims...
It's beautiful.
Does it need such a big engine?
-Why not?
Is a Renault is a Renault.
Crazy, huh?
Thank you so much. It was delicious.
Thanks for the invitation.
I must thank you.
You defended me.
It was hardly neccesary.
Thanks anyway.
My husband thanking a Frenchman?
Wow!
Mathias is no ordinary Frenchman.
He's a good Frenchman.
The exception proves the rule.
We're all the same.
Once you know them,
you realize that everyones..
..the same. Right?
Well said,
but I don't agree.
Are you married, Mathias?
-No, I'm single.
Seeing anyone?
Huh, It's complicated.
err.. Complicated? Why?
Because... How to explain...?
I love my girlfriend,
who is black.
But her family hates whites.
We can't be together...
That's horrible.
Is she pretty?
Yes. Beautiful.
It's stupid. Stupid.
Mathias, may I give you some advice?
-Sure.
If I were you, I'd give her
family a chance.
Are you in love?
Love conquers all.
It's true.
I'll have to think
on it.
After the birth, came 3 kings
with gifts for Jesus.
And talking of good news...
One of our faithful families,
the Vandevoordes...
...Announce the engagement of
Louise Vandevoorde to...
...With another parishioner:
Bruno Vanuxem.
Our best wishes for their happiness.
You shouldn't have returned.
-I had to.
I lost thirty pounds
with the ambulance.
I must do something quickly.
-I cannot.
Do it for me.
Many have done it.
You are won't be the first or the last.
I Can't.
-Yes.
Relax, it won't hurt a bit.
I can't.
It feels wrong.
Don't be so difficult.
So... look...
Watch.
Start with a small one...
...then the big ones...
Can I put a couple
in my coat lining?
No. We run no risk!
Everything you need is here...
I'll leave you alone. I'll wait outside.
Here.
If you need help,
call me... or not.
How was it? Everything in?
You see, it's not complicated.
I bring the money back to?
No, definitely not.
Put it behind the door trim.
Take these back roads.
Janus says they never use them.
That'll takes time.
-It's better than being caught!
What is it?
-I must hurry.
Well, then drive. Go!
I didn't wish you Merry Christmas.
'Merry Christmas', Mathias.
Thank you.
Is something wrong?
-It's nothing.
You've not had a great Christmas?
-No, and it your fault.
My fault?
-I'm sick of your Belgian face.
That fry-hungry face, you know?
I love Belgium and the Belgians,
but not you, racist jerk.
Well, I say - I am French,
and you can catch the plague!
Mathias?
What is it?
-I'm quitting and leaving.
I'll say goodbye and wish you
good luck with Vanuxem.
What? I'm not marry Vanuxem.
-Well, the priest said it.
A setup by my brother. I was furious.
Were you in the church?
Yes... Fuck... Ruben.
Shit...shit..shit
Shit...shit..shit
Ruben, I insulted you.. to..
..to test our friendship.
And?
What? Go ahead.
That you earned.
-We're even?
No!
This is for 'Fry-eating face'.
Look, look ... Wait.
Damn, that red van.
Hurry!
Faster!
I've got my foot right down.
Are you blind...
There's a fence...
Unlucky!
I swear I'm innocent.
I know nothing of Customs.
We're not stupid, Mr. ambulance driver.
Why are you on the back roads?
My family is waiting in Brussels.
The car is empty.
I can't verify the registration - no signal.
Why is he sniffing his back?
-Why's he sniffing your ass?
That's normal. Dogs do that.
Don't they? It's natural.
Other dogs maybe, not humans.
You're not a dog? Are you?
I have a dog. Perhaps he smells...
You're going to have your picture taken.
-Why?
To see why your ass smells
so nice to dogs!
Shut up...
You're something special!
Look at this, Mathias.
Here's what Grizzly sensed.
The guys' full of drugs
In his Ass?
No, it's impossible!
Why?
-Don't you remember?
I have no idea how
these drugs ended up there.
Someone must have planted them!
Someone stuffs 30 balls up your ass
and you know nothing.
That's right.
Oh god, oh god...
How would they do this?
-I've no idea.
I can't explain it.
Maybe he was sleeping with
his ass in the air.
Could be. Or his wife of is
committing adultery with a magician.
Abracadabra ...
What is this?
-A rabbit?
Magic.
-Big magic.
When you woke up, didn't you feel it?
-Yes, it itched.
When it comes through the plastic.
It itches.
Well, It did.
Happy now? It did.
What am I looking at?
Ten years, minimum.
Or give us all the information you have.
I'd end up in the channel.
We're going to the anti-drug brigade.
Then your in their hands.
What will they do?
-They'll get the drugs out...
...Weigh them and put them back.
-Really?
Probably insert a microphone.
-A walkie-talkie.
To keep your eye on you.
There's enough space in your ass.
We should cover this area.
There's quite a lot of movement at night.
Few people live there,
and it's close to the motorway.
We should park here.
And someone here.
Would you stand there?
At the highway?
My mule got arrested on
the route you showed me.
Quiet. They'll hear you
They don't use those roads.
-Impossible. You must have screwed up.
We're fucked.
They make there own routes up!
How do I get my trade back?
Yes, how does he gets his trade back?
I'm asking you!
-Oh yeah...
Well, he had to write down everything.
You'll get your money back.
What's left...
You've spent my money?
You never keep your head.
Forget that-
there was ten times more in that car.
What's happening in the kitchen?
Jacques...
I have to go,
otherwise they'll come in.
They're looking at a map.
Try to memorise it.
Clear?
Go!
We came for lunch,
not a long wait.
I was backed up in the kitchen and...
Move the plates...
then I can move the map.
Excuse me.
Shall I clean it?
No, It's just fine.
As you wish.
Jacques.. The meals?
I want a map.
A Map. Here.
-No, the menu.
Good heavens. Bingo.
We've got them.
Let him come to us.
-Customs...
Come closer.
He won't stop.
-Watch this!
Ruben, he's not stopping.
-He'll stop!
I have the Spike-Mat.
You Okay?
Thank you.
You'd have done the same.
I think not.
What are you doing?
Did you drive Duvals car.
-I almost ran over Vandevoorde.
He shot at me.
-Vandevoorde shot at you?
Yes. What a setback.
Did he recognize you?
-There he was here.
He shot at me.
-Really? Are you hit?
Good job it's not our car.
-I'm stopping now. This was my last ride.
Wait.
Look what Duval gave us.
The agreed amount and
an advance for the next ride.
There is no next ride.
It's finished.
I beg you. Two more rides.
-No, Irene, it's over.
We have enough.
Our heads are above water.
I've not surfaced!
Damn, you've no ambition!
You don't get many
opportunities like this.
We have money.
A lot of money.
Aren't you glad to see us?
Yes, but...
...it's the last day of the Customs.
-Tell me about it.
A glass of champagne?
The end of Customs is not a
reason to celebrate.
Give us a drink. Something strong,
We could use it.
So could I.
Best wishes.
Goodbye, Customs.
I'm not looking forward
to the the new year.
What are you doing tonight?
Nothing special.
You're spending it alone?
Yes, you know.
Come eat at my dads,
Vanuxem too.
-I Can't. I'm French.
Then pretend your Belgian.
No, I just can't.
Come on.
He has a spare Belgian uniform.
This is your size? Maybe it's a little big?
-I'm not much larger. Right?
Happy New Year.
Good evening,
Mister Vandevoorde.
Who is this again?
Mathias, my new colleague.
He comes from...
Liege, huh?
Best wishes,
Mister Vandevoorde.
Don't talk so strangely.
-No?
Mathias?
From Liège, yes.
From Liege?
Olivia, my wife.
Nice to meet you.
-Right.
Leopold, my son.
We'll wake him
for the fireworks.
Louise, my sister.
Nice to meet you.
Ruben never told me you were beautiful.
Mathias.
Sit down.
Thank you, it's very nice.
-That does not sound very Liège.
My sister is pretty,
but outspoken.
Can I have some bread?
-Sure.
Well?
I was born in Brussels.
-You've no Brussels accent.
My parents moved a lot.
What do they do?
Stop be difficult!
Ignore her.
It's not her fault - she a dyke.
Dad...
-Excuse me, lesbian.
You're hard on men,
but they do nothing.
That's true.
They do nothing.
What you can do is annoy?.
-Exactly.
That 's enough. Come on, eat.
Enjoy your meal.
Okay?
-You can't just pretend.
I do this because I love you...
-Silence.
Let's start over.
-Are you serious.
I am.
Let them get to know me.
Maybe then they'll accept us.
-Digestive, Liege?
Yes, a digestive would be nice.
-Why are you talking weird.
I'm imitating Belgian.
If you don't care about me, I'll go.
This must stop.
What are you doing?
You're crazy. What are you doing?
I can not be without you.
I miss you, I want you.
Idiot, my familys' outside.
Your brother loves me.
I also like him.
He insisted that I came along.
If he found out... What would he say?
You're so beautiful and smell nice.
You drive me crazy.
They'll wonder where we are.
I don't care.
Mathias, not here.
Not here?
-No.
Is there someone on the toilet?
-Yes, busy.
I need to use it - urgently.
-Go outside.
No! It's freezing outside.
-One Moment.
What're you doing?
-I'm hiding.
Out the window!
Out the window
-Jump!
It's freezing!
-Jump. That'll cool you off.
Quick...
My clothes.
Fast.
Finally. A moment you said?
Why's the window open?
All yours!
Why were you outside, Liège?
Seeing if the fireworks had started.
It's not yet midnight.
It's not far off.
Thanks and best wishes.
-Sure.
Good night, Dad.
Goodnight and goodbye.
Louise, take Vanuxem.
It's on your way.
If you want me to.
-I come too.
No, come with me.
I'll drop my family off...
...And bring you to France.
Goodbye and Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
Why stop here?
-Would you do me a favor?
Good evening, father.
What is it, Ruben?
Nothing wrong.
I wish you a happy 1993.
And I've made a resolution.
I'd like to introduce to you:
my friend...
Mathias...
Ducatel.
Good evening, father.
-Good evening, my son.
He is French.
And?
I am friends with a Frenchman.
I. have. a. French. Friend.
That's excellent, Ruben.
Father, it's incredible!
That is, father, for later...
You know, the Customs.
Later.
You know, Ruben, God's ways
are mysterious.
Exactly.
Tell him we're good friends.
We're colleagues. We trust each other.
And we're happy.
We're great friends, eh?
Tell him where your from..
..where you come from.
-From France. I'm French.
French - Frenchman.
Friendship alone is not
enough in the eyes of God
and friendship sought to get into
Gods good graces... is wrong.
That did not happen.
I had no ulterior motives.
Ours is a beautiful friendship.
It is simple loyalty
between two comrades.
Eh, buddy?
-Yes, my friend.
I do, however,
have ulterior motives.
I think you understand.
Of course, my friend.
What did you say?
I befriended you
because I want to marry your sister.
You've seen met her once.
No, we've been together a year.
In secret.
Goddamn!
You've been seeing my sister for a year?
You little bastard!
Vandevoorde!
Watch your language in God's house.
That bastards seeing my sister!
Get out!
You will not swear in this church.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of your!
You dirty French liar!
Not in God's house. Father...
Violence solves nothing.
You'll go to hell!
For touching this shit!
I'll make small fries from that jerk.
Ruben, I'm a friend...
I'm your friend.
Your sister loves me.
Shut up!
What is it?
I told your brother,
and he's gone crazy.
Shoot!
Kill me in front of your sister.
Kill both of us but...
-Move.
...I am miserable
without the Frenchman.
And when we broke up?
I'd wake up wondering...
..if my misery could
get any deeper.
You're just with him to
spite the family.
You think we weren't serious...
When he asked me to marry him,
I was so upset...
...upset and afraid...
...of you and your racism.
That's when I knew I loved him.
I love you.
I love you, Louise.
I love you, honey.
Happy New Year, Louise Vandevoorde.
Happy New Year, Mathias Ducatel.
I could never be without you.
-Me neither.
Is Ducatel there?
-One moment.
For you.
Mercier here. Can you come now?
There's a BMW doing 120.
I'll be there as
soon as possible.
There's a speeding BMW that
we must intercept.
Be careful.
I'm worried about Ruben.
We're at our post.
Can you hear me?
Shit!
He's just past the toll.
Blue BMW, French registration.
You didn't say "naturally".
What?
I say 'French Registration"
you usually say, "Naturally."
I only want Louises' happiness.
Live long and happily with her, but
if you get divorced, I'll kick your ass.
I am glad we are brothers.
Say that after the divorce
There he is.
Faster, faster, faster.
Not out the window. We're going too fast.
We come through ...
Try and keep the engine...!
Turn off the Engine. Get out.
Hands up.
Jacques, what are you doing here?
Transporting a couple of
cartons of cigarettes.
Why were you fleeing?
I didn't see you,
and it's smuggling.
Give me the keys.
What now?
-I cuff you!
Why?
-You're under arrest.
You've known me a long time...
this, because of a few cigarettes?
Your cigarettes?
What is that?
A large quantity of cocaine.
I didn't know.
I didn't look in the trunk!
Does your wife know about this?
Absolutely not.
I had no idea.
My God, Jacques.
What have you done?
I didn't know it was drugs.
He always said 'cigarettes'.
So this wasn't the first time?
-No, the fifth. Hey, baby?
Can't you keep your mouth shut!
Sorry...
Mathias, Ruben,
we couldn't make ends meet.
Do we face prison?
-Ten years apiece!
Unbelievable.
Unless they cooperate.
And that means?
We want to know everything, so that
we can catch this gang.
What..?
Like undercover?
Something like that.
This way you stay out of prison
and just get a fine.
Is that ok with you?
-Not really.
We'll help you, but I take all the blame!
I don't want Irene to go to jail.
That would be nice.
Did it go OK?
-Very good. Very lucky, great.
And this dent?
-That...
There was a problem on the highway,
but I was able to flee.
Nothing wrong.
Do not worry, Mr. Duval,
the drugs are still in it.
You know about the drugs?
No, I meant to say 'cigarettes'.
I must say that the atmosphere in
here is a bit tense...
I guess I just got confused.
Bastard!
Stop, stop!
Jacques!
You all right, Jacques?
What happened?
To the success of
the Franco-Belgian brigade.
Belgian-French.
Great.
Since when have you worked
in secret with us?
Many, many years.
A very long time.
I'll tell you about it..
-No. This is not the right time.
Why not?
Not a good time.
Why not?
Why not.
Where was I ...
No.
You're incorrigible.
Let's celebrate.
To everyone's health.
-When she and I...
Come on, Jacques.
-In the beginning I was ...
You stupid idiot!
King of the morons!
Look at the moron!
I'm in the same car, Officer?
-Commissioner.
You're quite handsome...
Jacques, I am being abused.
I found this in a bag...
...under the sofa.
Does this happen to...
Yes. That is mine.
We are all alike, son.
Humanity.
And we share one planet,
Earth. That is all.
From...
What does the Frenchman
want now?
You cannot park there!
A Gook.
Dad, Isn't China also on the earth?
Yes, but not this side.
Hey, Yellow-man
Your van is blocking
my driveway... move it!
You're talking to me?
You have a problem?
