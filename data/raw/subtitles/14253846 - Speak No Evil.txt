[Derek] Today we made ravioli
with um,
I think there were bits of

Well, you should come
to the cooking class with us
maybe tomorrow,
because I believe that tomorrow
they're making the gnocchi.
The ravioli that they tried to
teach...
- [clinking glasses for toast]
- [Derek] Oh, right.
I'm sorry to bother you during
this very lovely dinner.
I just want to say two things.
I hope we didn't wake you up,
because the noise you heard last
night, the banging on the door,
- [all laugh]
- Very quickly, that was me.
- [laughter]
- We couldn't find our way,
so we were very late here.
Ah-ah, sorry for that.
Ah, we don't know each other.
That's the way it goes on holidays.
But uh, you know, I want to meet
you people,
because you look all so nice
and beautiful.
And uh, I want to toast to you,

To the food, of course.
And to love.

Patrick, nice to meet you.
We met at the Villa?

- Hi. Karin.
Sorry, I forgot to introduce
myself. I'm Louise...
- [Patrick] Hello.
- And this is Agnes.
And what's your name?
[Louise speaking foreign

Abel has difficulties speaking.
So, if he feels some sort

he can get a little insecure.
- [both] Ahh.
- But there's no pressure at all.
And who is this?

[Agnes] Ninus.
Ninus?
Agnes just lost it,
so Bjørn went to find it.
You went to find the rabbit?
[Bjørn] Yes.
That's very heroic of you.
[laughs] Thank you.
No, no. I'm serious... respect.
Well, thanks.
You're very welcome.
So, did you guys have lunch yet?
[Louise] By the way,
where are you guys from?
[Karin] Holland,
the southern part.
Yeah, countryside,
it's a beautiful area.
Wow, I would just love to move
outside the city
and be close to nature and all...
Yeah.
Well, you should come and visit us.
- That would be great...
- [waiter] Lasagna Vegeteriana.
- [waiter] Prego.
- Ci, Vegetarian?
- [waiter] Vegetarian.
- Yes, thank you.
- [waiter] Tagliatelle ai funghi.

[waiter] E pizza margherita.
So, you're a vegetarian?
Yeah, I eat fish, but yes,
I'm a vegetarian.
That's so good.
We could all learn from you.
Yeah, good for the environment, really.
Well... thank you...
[waiter] E peposo.
Oh, Grazie Mille.
Oh, I'm starving.

[both laugh]
[Patrick] Wow.
Well, I actually think that
Dutch and Danish people
are very similar.
Yeah, so we're the same.
[laughs]
Well, in many ways I think so, actually.
It's uh, the same humor,
the same um, the same um...
same culture.
Yeah, at least we have more in
common with people from Holland,
than with the Swedish people.
[Patrick] I's so glad you say that.
- Yeah?
- [Bjørn laughs]
Really. No, I had
a Swedish colleague
when I worked for the Médecins
Sans Frontières.
You're a doctor?
Yeah.
No, really. He was the most

we would love to invite you
to come to visit us.

It's a little souvenir

[Bjørn] It's Louise who bought
it, so...
Thank you.
[Karin] Uh, where's Abel?

He's been cooking all day.
He's making Wild Boar.

This is your room.

I want to show you my pool.

Look, Agnes, we made you a

And... a mermaid?
Yes, it's something that I think
represents Denmark very well.

- Yeah.
I know it.
I've heard it's quite small
and disappointing.

Well, actually there are some
anecdotes about it
that are really nice.
Oh yeah, you know what is also
nice?

- Hmm?
This is for you.
Oh, no-no, that's fine...
I insist.

It's delicious. It's crispy and

Very good.
Oh, hi Abel.

But it is really lucky we've got
the GPS,
because otherwise we'd have got
lost like 20 times
I had it under control.
No, [laughing] the GPS had.
- I had.
- [both chuckle]
[Abel crying in background]
It's frightening sometimes,
how we lose our ability to find
our way through life.
Because we hand over the
responsibility to technology.
That is so true.
I mean, people nowadays don't
have a clue how to read a map.
I must admit that driving in a
car like that,
with GPS and all these
modern things, you...
I-I want to turn it off sometimes.
And, as you were saying,
Patrick...
Is he all right?
No, no, he's fine. He's fine.
He'll fall asleep in a minute.
He just does this sometimes.
It's part of his disease.
Oh yeah, what is that?
Abel has what you call
"congenital aglossia".
Meaning basically, he's born
without a tongue.
Or... a much smaller tongue than
you and me.
But is he in pain?
Oh no, no pain.
He just has a hard time
making himself understandable.
Oh no, I understand everything
he says.

Uh, excuse me?
Agnes really wants
to try the slide.
And do you think it is possible
to ask Abel to move away
just for one second?
[Karin] So sorry about this.
No, it's okay, it's nothing.
[Patrick speaking to Abel

Patrick, it's all right.
He doesn't have to.
No, he wants to say

he really wants to.
[Patrick speaks

[Abel] Sorry.

- It's good, right?
It reminds me
of what we call a Mazarin?
A Mazarin tart...
a Danish thing.
Come here.
[sighs]
Hey, am I interrupting?
No-no, of course not.
Well Patrick and I would like to
invite you to dinner tonight.
Oh, that's so nice of you.
Yeah, there's a nice restaurant
with great local food
just up the road.
And we wouldn't want you
to miss the opportunity
while you're here.
That sounds good.

No, tonight is without kids.
Didn't I tell you that?

Oh, that's great. It's the house
specialty... you should try it,
- Okay
- It's good.
Yeah, and the "boerenkool"?
Boerenkool. Oh, that's also
stamp pot, you'll love it.
It's delicious, they make it
very well here.
And what is stamp pot?
Stamppot? Oh, that's typical
Dutch. Very traditional.
Like potatoes and vegetables,
you stamp it all together.
Steef! Let me take care of you
guys. Okay?
Yeah, fine with me.
[speaking foreign language]
And remember, I'm a vegetarian.
I'm sorry?
Yes, I don't eat meat.
Oh, yes, yes. So good
for the environment, yes.
But you eat fish, right?
Yes.
So you're not a vegetarian,
you're a pescatarian.
Yes.
Yes, Steef?
[Steef and Patrick speaking
foreign language]
Hmm?
And fish is not meat?
Of course, um, but it's better
for the environment.
And the way
the fishing industry works
and how we treat the oceans
is not affecting the climate?
[scoffs]
Well, I would like
to propose a toast...
- Okay.
- For uh,

without saying goodbye.
No, as I was just trying
to tell Patrick,
we had some really lovely days.
And then I ask again, why are
you leaving...
[Karin interrupts in foreign

We had some good days,
it's just um...
there's just some things that...
that make us believe that
it's best that we go home.
What are those things?
I want to know.
- It's um, many things.
- Such as?
It's just, um... such as...
Such as the bed for instance.
It's really small, and uh,
and Agnes doesn't want to sleep
on the floor,
so she comes in at night.
Okay, so
with all of your respect...
First of all, I'm a vegetarian.
But all you've been doing since
we got here was serving meat.
But we have all sorts of food.
You can have a hagelslag
sandwich right now.
I can make it for you.
No, thank you.
And last night
at that restaurant or...
roadhouse or whatever that place
was, it was...
it was very uncomfortable
to drive.
And the music was so loud.
And you were drinking
and driving.
And the way you were touching
each other in front of us
that just made me so
uncomfortable, I'm really sorry.
But it just um... so many things
have felt so wrong.
I'm really sorry,
but it's just how it is.
I'm in shock.
[opens refrigerator,
clangs bottles]
[shuts fridge]
Can-can I say something?
Uh, first of all... Louise.
I am so sorry that we forgot
that you were a vegetarian.
And if there are things
you don't eat,
you just could have told us.
Right?
[Louise scoffs]
And our house is not huge,
so we cannot offer you
a big luxury room
and a king-size bed, Bjørn.
I'm sorry.
And I am truly sorry that Agnes
doesn't feel comfortable
staying in Abel's room. But we
thought it was only natural.
I mean, if you only knew how
much Abel was looking forward to
sharing his toys
in his room with Agnes.
And the roadhouse,
as you call it...
the hugging and the dancing.
We were just having a fun
evening. Guys, come on.
I mean, dancing
and kissing the one you love.
What's the problem?
To me, it's crossing the line
when you pick up my daughter
at night.
And then you take her
into your bed,
where you slept next to her, naked.
Yeah but, where were you?
Louise,
I mean, Agnes kept calling?
She was crying.
[Karin] Where were you?
First of all there's nothing we
can do now to change the way
you have felt
during these past few days.
And it truly breaks my heart
to hear
that you haven't enjoyed
your stay.
It makes me wonder
if maybe I've failed as a host.
No one is forcing you to stay.
But I really hope you do, 'cause
today is gonna be a great day.
I promise you, today,
it's gonna be great.

It's not about that.
No! This is about doing
what is right.
This is really...

when he is crying
instead of shouting at him.
Yeah, and Patrick,
what the fuck?
Why can't you just
let him dance?
Oh, that wasn't dancing.
[speaking in foreign language]
Yeah, but you threw a cup
at him!
[speaking foreign language]
Sorry, but I can't listen to you
talk to him that way.
