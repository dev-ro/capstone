- Find any?
- No.
I don't believe you.
Where are you going?
Look how pretty you are.
It's wild.
I wonder if I should cut it.
No, I won't let you.
It would be easier.
If you do, I'll leave you.
No, because then I'd kill you,
and myself as well.
You're very dissuasive.
- Do you love me?
- I do.
Is that all?
I adore you.
Come.
GOODBYE FIRST LOVE
When do I see you next?
- I don't know. Soon.
- Not tomorrow?
I can't this weekend.
Let's talk on Monday.
Ok. See you, then.
- I suggest you drop it.
- Oh yeah?
Enough! You'll wake up Dad!
No!
I have to tell you something.
You won't like it.
What?
I'm dropping out of school.
No. You shouldn't do that.
I've made up my mind.
I haven't gone in months.
You'll regret it your whole life.
I'll go crazy if I keep on going.
I'm leaving
with Julien and Mathias.
Back to South America.
When your father hears this...
he'll take back the studio
and stop giving you money.
I know.
- I'll manage.
- Really?
Will you be taking Camille?
She says if I leave,
she'll jump into the Seine.
Claude?
Heard of Jacques-Emile Blanche?
Yeah.
It's pretty.
Have it appraised.
Go to Drouot.
But why sell it?
You should hold onto it.
If you're sure,
I have a friend who'd want it.
Where did you get it?
My grandfather left it to me.
My parents will be pissed
but I have no choice.
I don't have enough
to leave in September.
Especially if we decide
to stay longer.
You're wearing makeup.
No need to do that for me.
I thought we were going
to meet this week.
Did you go out every night?
Forget it,
I don't want to know.
I hung out with Mathias and Julien.
We talked about our expedition.
And I went to a lousy party
in a shitty club in the suburbs.
Everyone was there
to fuck and do drugs.
- I took nothing and screwed anyone.
- Good for you.
Because I love you too much.
So why do you go to those parties
rather than see me?
I don't want
to become too dependent.
I'm afraid it'll be even harder.
Camille!
You know how tough it is
to sleep without you...
not to see you when I wake up?
- I can't live without you.
- Yeah, right.
It sucks you never believe me?
Your friends always get priority.
You're obsessed with your trip.
Don't be jealous.
It's ridiculous.
Easy for you to say.
I spend my life waiting for you.
I work nonstop and spend
every night at my parents'.
Go out, then.
Actually, I don't want to.
That's your right as well.
- You don't give a shit.
- You're such a pain!
Why do you want to fight?
I was so happy to come for lunch.
And you spoil everything.
Sorry but I'd rather leave.
Sullivan!
Give me a hand?
Dad's eating out.
I have no idea who with.
Your brother came and left,
as usual.
- No one called?
- No one.
Yes, Delphine!
She needs her history book.
Pull yourself together!
Stop moping.
- It's not your thing.
- What isn't?
- Relationships.
- I told you I was happy.
I'm allowed to be sad.
- All Sullivan does is make you cry.
- Tears of joy.
I cry because I'm melancholic.
You were full of life
before you met him.
It's been a year.
Time to move on.
He's the one.
You're 15! Don't be stupid!
Don't get worked up over
someone not into you.
What do you know?
Go see a movie or something.
Do some exercise.
Tone up. You're skinny.
Love is all I care about.
- It's all I live for.
- Spare me.
Here's your father.
- You're insensitive.
- That's it.
I'm not melancholic enough.
I won't mention him again.
Honey, can you get me
a cup of coffee?
Lukewarm as usual.
What about a decent
coffee machine?
If you're not happy,
go to a café.
- I'll use the microwave.
- Fine.
Damn brat.
Thanks, honey.
So? What are your plans
for the weekend?
I see.
My Romeo!
My baby, my sweetheart...
I thought you'd dumped me.
That I'd never see you again.
Are you crazy?
You know I love you.
I love you so much.
You disappeared again.
You could have called.
- You're cruel.
- Please, no fights.
You're so pretty.
I'm going to eat you.
Wait.
You drive me crazy.
Where are you taking me?
- Not to have sex.
- I sure hope so.
You stay here.
- No.
- Why?
You don't deserve it.
That's for sure.
We need to talk.
Again? What about?
We've said it all.
Come on.
- I'm not an animal.
- You are.
Let's snuggle.
You didn't come for nothing.
I brought some work.
I have a math quiz on Monday.
You won't get off this easily.
- I'll rape you.
- Oh, not that.
Little pervert.
- Hello.
- Hi.
How are you?
- This is Sullivan.
- Hello.
He may have
a nice Jacques-Emile Blanche.
- We want your opinion.
- Okay.
- Come on, 3000.
- Stop it!
It's a pretty painting,
but it's fake.
The signature's phony.
And it's tiny!
- But real.
- Honestly, it isn't.
It's a fake.
2500 is enough,
as a favor to you.
- No regrets?
- No.
Paris-CDG to Caracas
on TAP Portugal...
September 10th at 6:40 p.m.
Hi there!
Are you crazy?
I can even make it
to you from here.
Yeah, right. Come on down.
Idiot!
Let's go pick our room.
Not bad.
Perfect.
It's the kids' room.
Why not take one
that's more spacious?
To avoid searching for you
in the bed.
There's no one.
It's my dream house.
Hurry up, I want you.
Sex... always sex!
The only thing you care about.
Wouldn't you rather read
for a change?
We have all life long
to be serious.
Let's make the most of our youth.
Whatever you say.
Are you getting up soon?
No...
I'll go buy groceries then.
Where were you?
Visiting all of Ardeche?
Don't be like that.
I told you
I didn't want to be alone.
- You can't be trusted.
- Camille...
I don't want you to go.
What will I do without you?
You can't put everything
on my shoulders.
You have to live
your life as well.
We have to have experiences
to share, or else...
Or else what?
Scared you'll get bored?
Yeah, maybe.
And that you'll get bored too.
I'll never get bored.
You'll meet tons of girls
and leave.
I'm not going there
to meet girls.
To work, to learn...
To become a real person.
And our life is worth nothing?
- I mean nothing to you?
- You know you're not nothing.
I love you, Camille.
But you want to be everything.
That's not possible.
You're everything to me.
If I lost you,
I wouldn't survive.
That stuff makes me want
to leave you.
- You're so harsh.
- No, you are.
- Me?
- Yes.
With your lack of understanding,
your threats.
Come on.
Let go of me!
I'm sick of your tears.
Because you don't love me.
You drive me crazy.
Say it again and it's really over!
I'm leaving
and I'll be back in 10 months!
It's not the end of the world!
It's ready!
Mustard?
- Goodbye, Sullivan.
- Goodbye.
Have a safe trip.
Cheer up.
It won't be long.
He fell very sick
and died in 1924.
Lenin left a will.
In it he supported
his old friend Leon Trótski.
"Camille, my love,
I'm writing after three days
on the road.
Three nights with no bed,
I touched ground
only to change buses.
You're so far
and I miss you so,
I feel I'm going to die.
Tomorrow we have free time.
I'll be able to call you,
but I won't.
Don't be upset.
Hearing you without touching
is hard enough,
but your tears and reproaches
break my heart.
Each time we speak
I feel so awful afterwards.
I figure it's the same for you.
My long silences annoy you.
How can I share
my experiences with you?
How can I tell you about my trip
if each detail hurts,
and you take everything
as an insult?
As if what I experience
is against you, against us.
That's not true.
I love you with all my soul,
and my love for you is precious.
I carry it always.
Don't ever forget that".
Go find Dad
see if he needs help.
"I've been in the mountains
for 10 days,
stranded in a refuge
on a blue river,
nestled amid gorges
and waterfalls.
Everything here is peaceful,
the forest fulfils you.
Every day I feel further
from my life in Paris,
from the people I knew.
Lost in search of peace,
possibly utopian.
In Paris,
all I'd find is balance.
When allowed to change,
I grow closer to myself
and this ideal.
But you won't let me run away.
You follow me wherever I go.
I look for you while kissing others.
I think I love you
but I want you to disappear.
I don't want
to mean anything to you.
It was a dream,
not much remains
of what we thought we said".
This was invented
by a German philosopher, Leibniz.
He is targeted
in the character of the philosopher.
Leibniz's devise,
which Voltaire over simplifies,
all's for the best
in the best of all possible worlds.
What's on for this afternoon?
Reading?
Maybe.
THE MODULOR
Le Corbusier
You have nothing more fun?
It's time to turn the page.
Isn't it, honey?
Girls, you're late!
You have two minutes to change.
It's that way!
I go crazy standing
around for hours.
I can't even manage to think.
Not my carpaccio!
- Don't be mean.
- It's not for you.
It's all I have for dinner tonight.
- So hands off my carpaccio.
- What do I eat then?
You can't let me starve to death.
Have some cheese.
Here.
- Is there any bread?
- Nope.
Have crackers.
See your father?
We had dinner last week.
What's his girlfriend like?
I hear she's quiet.
You won't make me talk.
I'm not trying to.
I don't care.
What do you think?
I'm happy for him.
Your project
has its strong points.
It follows its unusual logic
through and through.
And yet... my problem lies deeper.
Student housing
isn't just for walking around,
spiritual awakening or whatever.
I like how you make
use of the site.
You want to work
on horizontality. Fine.
But it has to be functional.
The covered terraces, the trees,
the enlarged pond, why not?
The reflections
in the water are nice.
So is the footbridge
to the library.
But what about housing?
There obviously aren't enough.
And they're too small.
Closets.
Elegant, with big windows,
but closets.
In the winter, who'd want to walk
two miles around the lake to go eat?
You put too much importance
on the water,
and not enough
on the living quarters.
Your project is more suitable,
for solitary retreat
than communal living.
What you've imagined
is a monastery.
'A house must please everyone,
unlike a work of art,
which doesn't have to please.
Art is the artist's private matter.
This is not the case for houses.
Art is born
without its need being felt.
Houses, on the other hand,
fulfill a need.
People seek to maintain
their comfort.
They hate whatever wrenches them
from their certitudes,
whatever bothers them.
This is why they love
their houses and hate art'.
"Four years... and what?
Nothing, but silence.
Every day is another day
without him.
But I have a vocation.
It's a reason to live.
Isn't that enormous?"
Shit!
I meant to warn you.
No.
Why not?
Because.
I don't feel like it.
- You're bothering me.
- You're something?
Sleep here if you want,
just don't touch me.
Is everyone here?
Alexander, shut the door?
Today I'd like to speak
about the shape of something.
And the thing in question
is a glimmer.
What shape would it have?
In sum, what is a glimmer?
A very faint light?
Where can it come from?
- A candle?
- What else?
- A gaze?
- Yes.
A reflection?
Something shiny?
- We say 'glimmer of hope'.
- Indeed.
Twilight or dawn?
Glimmers of daybreak.
Is the connotation of this word
positive or negative?
A glimmer.
Is it something you want to see?
What does it evoke for you?
Its form, its representation?
It's the remains...
The trace light leaves?
- It's what escapes darkness?
- Good.
In general, a glimmer
implies two things...
light and darkness.
What do you think?
This weekend I was reading
a text by Tadao Ando,
an area
with a glimmer of anything,
where anything happens'.
Think that over, because
it's what's missing in your projects.
The problem is you seem
to take light for granted.
Something is missing,
a nuance that would make
all the difference.
Something we might
call 'the journey'.
The way you
approach light is too...
literal, too mechanical.
It should also be
a way of expressing doubts.
Start it all over from scratch,
Rethink the building from
the inside out from the darkness,
as if starting
from a shadowy mass.
And to get started, tell me each a
word you associate with darkness.
Don't think first,
the point is not to be original.
- Night.
- Abyss.
- Secret.
- Death.
You see?
Architecture must grapple
with all of these words.
But first,
there's something else,
something essential,
that's linked to all of them.
- The past?
- Almost.
Memory.
To submit another proposal.
We sent it last week.
They still haven't paid us
from before.
I'm coming.
Laura, can you continue?
What's visible here,
is only half the project,
It's like an iceberg.
Imagine this gate,
the representation
of an ideal city,
extremely well-planned,
and at its cultural pinnacle.
"And they absorb flatly
and functionally,
the pictorial world in silent joy".
I haven't had time to tell you,
but I like your new house a lot.
In your work, there's,
a courage and maturity
rare for your age.
What brought you to architecture?
I don't know.
Places affect me
and I need to get a hold on them.
I feel like I understand
their language.
It's the only thing
I could move mountains for.
How did you become an architect?
At first I didn't want to be one.
I wanted to be a clarinetist.
I had a problem
and couldn't continue.
- Regret it?
- No, not at all.
It's a nice profession,
but too solitary for me.
It would be a shame to leave,
without taking a dip.
And I wanted to show you this site
which I find amazing.
Before, no one used
to come here,
between the airport
and the industrial zone.
Ever since they built this,
people started coming.
They come from Copenhagen
to spend the day.
It's recreational
and it respects its environment.
It's peaceful,
despite
its proximity to the airport.
It's sheltered from the wind.
Let's go check it out!
"Solitude isn't weighing me down,
for once...
The clouds seem
to be parting, at last."
- Hello.
- Hello.
I'm coming.
What do you want to do?
We said we'd go to the Louvre.
Aren't you sick of museums?
On the contrary.
I'm making up for lost time.
You never talk about yourself.
I don't want to bore you
with my stuff.
I'd rather talk about
more interesting things.
Your life's not interesting?
Your family?
That's not it...
I'm in the middle of a divorce,
It's hard.
It's the last thing
I want to think about with you.
My son Nils lives with his mother.
You never see him?
Sure I do.
I go to Berlin every weekend.
Except the ones you
spend with me.
Except those.
Like you, I feel no nostalgia.
Only the future counts.
These past years,
up until we met,
were nothing, a void.
Just a lot of pain.
You shouldn't reason like that.
At your age,
nothing is in vain.
Life is never what you expect.
Your fantasy-version of the world
is doomed to failure.
It's up to you to create one
that's deeper, more real.
That's how you become yourself.
- Here.
- Thanks.
Next time at the Louvre,
let's follow the same path
we did today.
So everything settles in.
I need to do things twice
so they stick in my memory.
Don't throw away the lamps.
Put them in storage.
-And the balustrades? We remove them?
-No.
It's in the files.
They're perfect.
Camille, don't walk there!
- Don't be foolish.
- It's fine.
The granite's in perfect shape.
After a century of wear and tear.
It's stunning.
Remember the granite floors
in Dessau?
Look at this sophisticated gutter.
Yes, I know.
The downspout
is right above the drainpipe.
The water lands in this open box.
The tube came here,
just an inch above.
Very attractive,
playing the cylinder off the square.
Will you keep it.
Let me show you.
The downspout and the box.
We'll restore the glass bricks
so the water is visible.
Like it's following its course.
It's important that the downspout
not touch the box,
which acts as a conduit.
The water is channeled,
but free.
I want to put back my window
on the second floor.
- Because it's missing.
- Quiet.
It's an embassy.
No need to make it a bunker.
Excuse me.
Selma?
Hello.
Camille! How are you?
How's Sullivan?
Still in South America?
He came back a while ago.
Thank God.
- If ever he wants to say hi.
- Okay, I'll tell him.
I thought about the windows.
I want to rework them.
Let's put the air vents elsewhere.
- They'll say no.
- I don't care.
I can't stand it anymore!
We had to tear down a wall
that was fine!
Come have a look!
You're paying!
It'll be approved next week.
- Anne will send it.
- Okay.
Yes, I called you Friday
about a busted generator.
You sent someone and
three hours later it broke again.
IT'S SULLIVAN.
CALL ME.
I'M SCARED TO.
Still have your studio?
I don't live in Paris.
I've been in Marseille
for three years.
But I come and go often,
to see friends and family.
For work too.
- For work too.
- I figured.
And you're working?
I'm a photographer.
That's what you wanted.
For the local press.
'Human-interest stories'.
A friend and I began
a small company. We're handymen.
That's the money I live off of.
- And Marseille?
- Yeah, I like it.
In Paris I never felt like I fit in.
It depresses me here.
A friend of mine
has a place in Cassis.
We go swimming every weekend.
Let's go.
I want to take a walk.
I work here in Paris
for a Norwegian architect.
I hope I'll have my own firm
in a few years.
You'll be an architect?
I'm impressed.
I'd never have imagined.
- What did you think I'd become?
- I don't know.
Never thought about it.
- Do you live nearby?
- At Bastille.
But I'm moving in
with my boyfriend.
- Have you been together long?
- Long enough.
I love him as much as I loved you,
but differently.
Our relationship changed me,
it gave me strength.
Sorry I hurt you so much.
You wanted to stay free.
It seems so far away now.
It was another person,
another life.
Are you, seeing anyone?
I was with a girl for a while,
but we just broke up.
- Otherwise, just flings.
- Flings?
Not you?
Nothing at all.
That's a shame.
It hurts to hear you say that.
You can't imagine.
I didn't mean to hurt you,
I was just talking.
- I have to go.
- Already?
I have something at 7 pm,
clear across Paris.
So get going.
I want to replace the concrete pit
with four metal structures,
Zinc finish.
Rework this plot of land
and make smaller, more viable units.
Can you come? It's urgent.
And add thin strips of grass...
I'm bleeding.
You're bleeding?
Since when?
An hour ago.
I called the doctor.
It was a miscarriage.
There are some tests to do.
I loved my little baby.
I know.
Will we have others?
Of course.
Why?
I was ready.
You have time.
You're young enough.
You're in too big a hurry.
I'm so lucky I found you.
It's a miracle.
I'm the lucky one.
You're the light of my life.
Hi.
I lost track of the time.
Lots of friends to see.
Short trip.
I almost left.
Thanks for staying.
Why are you here?
Repainting an apartment.
I'm working like crazy.
Our firm won a bid and they
made me project manager.
I didn't expect it so soon.
That's great.
Congratulations.
Let's see
if there's room upstairs.
Excuse me.
But the pressure is enormous.
Maybe I won't be strong enough.
I'm sure you're strong enough.
It's here.
Very fancy.
I almost forgot...
From last summer.
Not in front of me.
If you prefer.
Go back to your architect.
- What a bad movie.
- You didn't like it. Too bad.
- You did?
- A lot!
No way.
What did you like?
The characters, the dialogue,
the story. Everything.
I don't understand you.
It's so French!
The actors are annoying,
it's talky, complacent...
- I found it awful.
- You just don't get it.
It's beautiful and deep.
You're not sensitive enough.
I don't even want to discuss it.
I see you still have a monopoly
on sensitivity.
And I see we still never agree.
That's the only thing
we can agree on.
We have no common taste.
But we agree on the essential.
I don't think so.
But it doesn't stop me
from loving you.
I'll always love you
and never know why.
Camille, stop it!
It's true.
What do you think?
- Abandoning me?
- As if I wanted to leave?
It's your fault if you leave.
Stay instead!
- Hello.
- Hello.
Careful.
I saw scary stuff in the papers.
It's up north, in Sanaa.
Not Aden.
I'll call you when I land.
Anything wrong?
You're not glad to see me?
I thought
about you all week long.
Should we go have a drink?
I just want to be with you.
Just me and you.
But it's impossible.
Yes, it is possible.
We even have all night.
Camille, you're crazy.
It's not what you wanted?
Yeah, but...
What about after? Tomorrow?
What happens then?
Thanks.
I've missed you so much.
How could we have
stayed apart so long?
You left me.
Did you forget?
No.
I never stopped loving you.
Not for a minute,
not for a second.
I have you inside me
like a disease.
Don't say that.
The window won't open.
It's this duct behind it.
We had no choice.
We said to put the duct here,
by the chimney flue.
We'd have to have rebuilt it,
rewire everything,
break the screed.
- We don't have time.
- Check the blueprints.
We'll do just as it says.
I have music.
I brought blankets.
I even have food for after.
- After what?
- After we make love.
You're always hungry after.
You have it all planned.
So how's the bed?
You're no longer
the pure girl from before.
My heart is still as pure.
But you're unfaithful.
You're cheating on a man you love,
who loves you.
That's my problem.
I'm so happy to see you again.
Nils' room,
he's Lorenz' son.
He's at his mother's.
This is the guest room.
We'll sleep in it.
It's me. Are you there?
You're not? Anyone home?
No one?
No one at all?
You can answer.
I won't talk.
I'll try your mother's.
Hello?
I just walked in.
- For me?
- Open it.
Like it?
Thanks.
Don't start crying.
I want to live with you.
I want you to be my wife.
To have kids together.
What's this?
A night gown,
so you can take it off me.
- Lights out.
- No, no...
I still want to see you.
I'm leaving.
My train's at 5 pm,
but I have to see my parents.
When will you be back?
Not too soon.
You don't want
to come to Marseille?
You want me to?
You'll see where I live.
And meet my friends.
So long.
He used the bus lane,
ran some red lights
and resisted arrest.
A suspect on the lam,
according to police,
who were involved
in a high-speed chase,
of an usual type on the slippery
streets of the capital.
This weekend
I'm going to Normandy with Anna.
When? Tomorrow?
- And me?
- You're staying.
I see.
- You're leaving tomorrow.
- Yes, tomorrow.
Okay.
That's not too cool.
I just got back.
I know, I canceled before.
Once more and she'll kill me.
And I'm not invited?
It's just girls.
Okay, okay. Good. Great.
Okay, okay.
You always say okay.
Damn it!
It's that asshole.
I have to answer.

I'M WORKING ANYWAY.
ANOTHER TIME?
- Hello.
- Hello.
I'd like a room for two nights,
please.
- Can you put these on the site?
- Yes.
I've been off one day
and guess what I did?
- What did you do?
- Nothing.
- Was it nice?
- Amazing.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Since Dad left, it's wild.
I'm alive again.
He had his good side.
He couldn't hurt a fly.
He's a very good person.
But day in, day out...
A pain in the ass!
I put up with it for 20 years!
I love being able to pig out
in front of the TV.
I almost forgot!
A letter for you.
I wonder who still writes
to you here?
"Camille,
I dreamt about you
while in bed with someone else.
You were expecting my child.
How can I stop thinking about it?
I'm leaving you,
too late or too soon to start again.
You're far from me
and I'm already in enough pain.
I don't know how to love you
with this love I can't control.
The ties that bind us
are stronger than time,
I'm leaving in the hope
of finding you one day,
when we'll be freer, older,
more worthy of our love..."
Dinner's ready.
I don't believe it.
Not him!
When will you finally get over him?
Lorenz?
Lorenz, where are you?
- Am I bothering you?
- Not at all.
Want to go down to the Loire?
- Right away?
- While there's still sun.
Can I meet you in half an hour?
All right.
Take a stick for the snakes.
And put on a hat!
