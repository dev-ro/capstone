How could you decide on your own?
Don't you know about the police?
How can we trust them?
Can we trust Vishwa instead?
He's the cause for this mess.
Look, Fami, you know what

Sir, I performed

He was the one...

So, that means you knew
one of them from before?
Yes, sir.
–Is that why you went...
Yes, sir.

–Yes, sir.
Did any one of them
behave inappropriately?

Meera, it seemed you laughed?
And were extra friendly?

Normal.
You had dinner together.
That's normal.

You laughed and chatted together.

So, they took great care of you.
Then why hit with him a bottle?

You caused him to bleed.

At that time,

But if someone touches you

...you feel so repulsed.
I said no repeatedly,

So, I lost it.
I didn't expect him

My pleading didn't work,
he got really aggressive.

Need I say anything more,
Your Honour?
Meera Krishnan says
Adhik tried to outrage my modesty.
That is why I hit him
in self–defence.
Mr. Satyamurthy, cross?
Mr. Satyamurthy, cross?
Such drama!
I've noticed
from the beginning, Your Honour.

This girl

Meera, you've beautifully edited
the events of that day...
...to suit your purposes.
But you did leave out a few things.

I shall elicit from you.
I'll ask you directly.
How much did you get paid?
–Objection, Your Honour.

Mr. Satyamurthy, careful.
–Your Honour,...
...what this girl claims
is hard to believe.

Would any girl go to a resort
with a man she has just met?
Sir, I thought I was safe
in the beginning.
Sir, I thought I was safe

I admit that was a mistake.
I shouldn't have gone.
You didn't make any mistake.
It was a deliberate, planned move.

No!
–Yes!
You felt safe with the boys.
You said so yourself.

You said so yourself.
What did you mean by that?
–I meant...
...I felt that
they weren't indecent boys.
So, you felt that were decent.
They won't create trouble.
So, you felt that were decent.
They won't create trouble.
They won't even think of it, right?
–Yes.
So, basically decent boys?
–Yes, but, sir.....
So, basically decent boys?
–Yes, but, sir.....
When you saw the boys,
you realised they were rich.
Surely they'd be interested
in some fun.
It would be easy to seduce them.
You could extract a ton of money.
It would be easy to seduce them.

But your plan failed.
Neither were they fooled,...
...nor were they interested.
Angered that it didn't go...
...nor were they interested.
Angered that it didn't go...
...the way you planned,
you hit him.
Instead of admitting that,
you claim that you were friends...
...and they insisted on dinner.
These are lies. Am I right?
...and they insisted on dinner.
These are lies. Am I right?
No, sir, we thought
we had become friends.....
Friends?
Friends?
It takes months and years
to become friends, Ms. Meera.
No, we thought
they were known to us.
Known to you.
That's what I'm also saying.
Known to you.
That's what I'm also saying.
You were well–versed with the
background of Adhik and friends.
You knew they were affluent.....
–Sir, at the time, I had no idea...
You knew they were affluent.....
–Sir, at the time, I had no idea...
...if they were rich or poor,
or well–connected.
I knew nothing!
–Fine.

–Fine.
Let's assume you went there
with the purest of intentions.
After having dinner
at the restaurant,...
...why did you drink?
...why did you drink?
They offered us.
–I didn't catch that.
They offered us.
–I didn't catch that.
They offered us a drink.
We had one drink each.
At last you admitted the truth!

You didn't claim
they forced you to drink.
Your Honour,
we've submitted a photo.
Your Honour,
we've submitted a photo.
In it, you can see Meera holding
a full bottle of booze...
...and pouring herself a drink.
...and pouring herself a drink.
Luckily, this was captured
on Venky's camera.
Sir!
Sir, the table was really small.

Adhik was sitting
a little further away.
So, he asked me to fix him a drink.
–Point to be noted, Your Honour!

Even Adhik's drink was made by her.
What we gather from this is,...
Even Adhik's drink was made by her.
What we gather from this is,...
...she had planned it
before taking them into the room.
Sir, the bottle was too far.....
–What?

It was far away.
–Okay, forget that.
Did you have just one drink?

One at the restaurant.
–And then?
One in the room.
–Women of Tamil Nadu...

–Women of Tamil Nadu...
...want liquor shops closed,
they protest on the streets.
But these girls.....
Anyway,...

Anyway,...
...you drank at the restaurant.
Then you flirted...
...with Adhik
and said naughty things.

and said naughty things.
The manager is witness to that.
What were you talking about?
I don't remember, sir.
You don't remember.
Shall I remind you?
You don't remember.
Shall I remind you?
You were discussing sexual
positions with Adhik.
And giving detailed descriptions,
which the manager overheard.

So, tell us, how much
do you charge for all this?

I remember, sir.
He told me a joke.
So, I told him one too.
–A joke?

Tell us so we can laugh too.
–Mr. Satyamurthy!
Your Honour, please allow her
to narrate the joke.
Your Honour, please allow her
to narrate the joke.
She's lying, Your Honour.
–I'm not lying!
Then what's the hitch?
Tell us the joke.
Even if it partly matches
with what the manager said,...
Even if it partly matches
with what the manager said,...
...we'll believe you.
I can't.
–Why?
I can't.
–Why?
Unable to make up
a fake joke on the spot?
No.
No.
Making a joke in private
and repeating it in public...
Making a joke in private
and repeating it in public...
...are different altogether.
–Exactly my point, Your Honour.
If a girl cannot even repeat
a joke like that in public,...
...then how will she admit
that she went there to solicit men?
Naturally she'll claim it was
a simple drink, a simple dinner.
But we should note that she readily
went with men she did not know.
But we should note that she readily
went with men she did not know.
Therefore I recommend that
the court disregards what she says.
And instead take the evidence
into consideration.
And instead take the evidence
into consideration.
For instance,
this video evidence.
If you take a look at the CD,
it will be clear...
...whether or not
they asked for money.

In the first clip,
Meera came out.
The other 2 girls followed her out.
They discussed money matters.

And they went back inside.
A while later,...
...Andrea comes out with Venky.
From Camera Two's footage,...
...Andrea comes out with Venky.
From Camera Two's footage,...
...you can see
that they are went into Room 503.
Venky went in first
and turned on the light.
Venky went in first
and turned on the light.
Then Andrea went in
and closed the door herself.
Shortly after,
the room lights went off.
And then Famitha
went out with Vishwa.
And then Famitha
went out with Vishwa.
They went into another room.
Suddenly loud sounds are heard...
...from Adhik's room.
Everyone rushed to his room.
...from Adhik's room.
Everyone rushed to his room.
Inside, Meera had asked Adhik
for more money.
He had refused.
They both started arguing.
He had refused.
They both started arguing.
Meera hit Adhik with the bottle
and fled to avoid trouble.
If she was not at fault,
then why run?
If she was not at fault,
then why run?
She could've called the police.
Why didn't she?
Because girls like her
won't go to the police.
Once they got into trouble,
they lodged a fake complaint.
Once they got into trouble,
they lodged a fake complaint.
In conclusion,
what's in the video is the truth.
The rest is a lie.
The rest is a lie.
Meera Krishnan, language!
–You and your clients are lying!
We didn't go there for money!
They repeatedly invited us,
so we only went to have dinner.
The room was filled
with cigarette smoke.
That is why we came out
for fresh air.
Andrea had been missing
for a while.
Andrea had been missing

So, Famitha went to check on her.
When I was about to leave too,...
...he grabbed me
and started touching me.
...he grabbed me
and started touching me.
I said 'no' many times.
I said 'no' many times.
But he held me in a tight grasp
and wouldn't let go.
Then I took the bottle
and hit him.
Then I took the bottle
and hit him.
Ask him to try
the same thing again, sir.
I'll break his head.
I'll break his head.
Meera Krishnan,
next time the court.....
But, sir.....
–Will have you removed!
Sir, please!
I never asked for money!
Sir, please!
I never asked for money!
Please!
–Meera, quiet!

–The court is adjourned.

They are all lying, sir!

I can't do this anymore, Fami.

I'm taking Meera home

There are 2 toll gates on the way.
Approximately 45 kilometres.
It would take a minimum

there is to the case.
There was nothing else

If a girl drinks,
she's not a decent person.
If a boy drinks, it's merely
injurious to health.

That doesn't mean
I support women who drink.
If drinking is wrong, then
it's wrong for women to drink...

for men to drink.
The scales of virtue should be
equally balanced for men and women.

In our country, men are created

So terms and conditions differ,
