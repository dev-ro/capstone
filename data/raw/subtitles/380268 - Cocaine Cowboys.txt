They will see that I have a
loaded shotgun
And we will shoot somebody.
I never traveled
for the county of Dade without being armed.
Not there is doubt on it.
I always had a he/she arms,
he/she didn't sleep well without her
especially in Miami of that time.
Edna Buchanan said in television
that it carries two weapons
and that all should make it.
Merret Steirheim,
then administrator of the county,
and the commissaries were furious,
so I was person it doesn't burnish for a while.
Miami was literally
being come below.
But the police help non Ilegaría
due to lack
of personal in the department.
The federal agencies
they admit to be paralyzed
for the lack of men, money and resources.
The department of police of Miami
it left frantically to look for personal.
More policemen in the street
they will help to revert this tendency.
They used to have parameters.
Not to never have consumed drug
to be police.
They reduced it
to in the last 10 anuses
and that didn't work.
"In the last five anuses."
They didn't reach even this way.
Lastly, Io reduced
to the last two anuses.
And Ilegaron to a point
in that hired them
if they didn't consume in that moment.
That was
in the biggest crisis of police corruption
from the days of Serpico in New York.
The whole class of the academy of that anus
it finished in prison or dead.
They are already three the officials
that they arrested this weekend.
Today's arrests was given
while other seven
they are in accused trial
of stealing to the drug dealers
and of selling the drugs themselves.
The Policemen of the Cocaine
they have been accused of conspiracy,
traffic of drugs and organized crime.
The result, impacting...
40 policemen and former policemen
arrested or suspended
in the last two anuses.
Sixteen suspended
in the last two weeks.
And that is not everything.
At least 30 more policemen
they will be suspended.
The hand of the law failed in Florida of the South.
Then stop to work
and let us abandon the streets.
We are committed
seriously and we will recapture
the control of the streets another time.
The system of justice doesn't work here.
I suggest that we revise the whole concept.
CENTAC 26 entered in operations
in December of the 81.
There were 25 organizations previous CENTAC
in all EE UU.
CENTAC means
"Tactical Central" Unit.
Our main objective
he/she went to unite to homicides
with the division of drugs.
They had connections
with the Antidrug Agency, with the FBI.
We were fighting
with criminal's type
with who we had not fought before.
The instructions
that I gave they were very simple.
In difficult times,
they take difficult measures.
You could use any method
to take out somebody of the streets.
We will come undone of them
imprisoning them
or killing them.
It was a dedicated unit
to be more active than it reactivates.
It was a different way to make the work
and it was necessary then
due to the criminal's nature,
so much with the Colombians
as with the Cubans
that they came from Mariel.
Miami seems to be had
transformed into the Lost Paradise.
In the autumn-winter of 1981
the article < i > Paradise Perdldo < /i>
it left in the magazine < i > Tlme.
The magazine < i > Tlme < /i > it squashed Miami.
The article of 9 pages
it was focused in Miami
as the problematic center of drugs,
crimes and refugees.
The politicians in Miami and in Dade County
they became crazy when Io saw.
The first question is:
"?Is it safe to visit Miami Beach?".
- ? What would he/she tell them?
- Again I tell them
that unless they come to traffic drugs,
it will be so sure here as Io it would be
in any part of the world,
included their own city.
We were divided worlds between two.
The capital of the sun and the amusement...
and the capital of the murder.
That era the idea of the article...
Ios criminals won
and we lost.
I Was Born in Cali, Colombia.
I arrived to EE UU in 1969.
I Grew in Chicago,
it was mechanical with my dad.
I worked for General Motors, there I learned
how to open cars.
Even young, they knew me
as one of the best
thieves of cars in Chicago,
and then, after the anuses 80,
it was known to be assassin for the poster.
JORGE "RIVl" AYALA
ASSASSIN
He/she admitted their participation in 29 murders
during Guerra of the Cocaine.
It is suspicious of other 12 murders.
I joined with a group of types.
We stole cars
and we sold them to the desguazaderos
for 200 or 500 dollars each car.
We used to steal 5 or 6 per night.
We were three.
We made good money.
Better than working with dad.
He/she came from a good family,
he/she had Io that needed.
Not he/she needed to steal cars
but it was for the money and for the enthusiasm
of entering in the car of somebody
and then to sell it.
Chicago
August of 1980
Restoring Tropicana.
We used to go
there for the public phone.
AIlí us Ilamaban.
We used it as office.
He/she took a specific place
where it parked
and nobody more Io used.
I arrive one morning,
and there was a parked car.
I asked to the waiter
of who it was. He/she said:
"Of a fat fish of Miami."
I told him/her that I cared
of who a carajo was.
He/she wanted to move the car, so me Io Ilevé.
The following morning
we were in the restaurant...
and three Colombians entered
asking for Riverita.
"I am looking for it
because my car was stolen."
"I am the type that you look for, I am Rivi."
"You stole me the car
and I want that me Io returns."
"Not you Io will return.
"Give me 500 dollars because now it is mine.
"You parked where you didn't should."
He/she began to laugh and he/she told me:
"Yes that have eggs?do you know?".
I said: I "listened that before."
And he said: ?" What will you make?".
"It is simple. 500 to recover it."
He/she paid me, Ilaves takes out and he/she opens the cajuela.
Ilena of weapons was.
Revolvers, automatic guns.
And he/she asks me if he/she had gone to Florida.
"Yes, with my dad."
"?Do you have relatives there?"
"Yes, about six."
He/she asked me if Ilevarlo could Miami.
"Clear?will you pay me?"
He/she said that he/she would give me 5000 dollars.
I told him/her that it was well.
To Ilegar, he/she said that he/she had some businesses,
maybe we could work for him
and to make more money
if we stayed there.
"?To make what?"
He/she said: To "give drug
"and to pick up the money.
"Maybe to sell marijuana
from time to time."
The pay was good, 1000 dollars per day.
The first time that we work was
with people of the business of the drug.
But he/she didn't have intentions of killing people.
It was this way later, but...
Weeks later
we were in Jacaranda,
a night Colombian club in Miami.
Thin he/she comes closer and he/she asks me:
"?Are you our supplier?".
He/she tells me: He/she "hears, you should leave
"because we will give a blow here.
"Those of that table,
"the six Colombians
that they are laughing and taking liquor
"we will liquidate them. To all."
I thanked him/her the.
I asked him/her go to warn to my boys,
except to Vanegas, the Black one,
because it was drugging.
We tell him/her Black because it was very dark.
It was black Colombian.
I went to the bathroom and I warned him/her.
"We have to leave,
they will kill somebody."
But I didn't tell him/her to who.
It asked me him to give him/her
a moment and I came out.
Then Vanegas went to that same table
and he/she told them that they left,
because it will have a shooting.
It ruined the blow, it was an accident.
He/she knew one of them
so alone he/she tried to protect their friend.
I was out, Vanegas came out.
Behind Vanegas,
all pushed to leave.
Thin Ilega in its moto, was angry.
"You Io ruined everything
"and it should not have warned them."
I said: ?"Of what do you speak?".
"You warned them, they didn't know,
"and the only ones that Io knew
"they were you. You."
I told him/her that yes,
that I warned to my boys.
I said: He/she "waits, I will speak with Black."
I asked him/her if it had warned them.
"I told to one of them of the shooting,
"but he/she didn't know that it was that table."
I told him/her that we were in problems.
I returned and I told him/her that Io had made
but that it was an accident.
He/she told me that it was in problems
with their boss,
and that the boss wanted to know me.
"Tell to your boss that was an accident."
"Not he/she wants to hear that,
"alone you", he/she told me.
"The boss wants to know you.
"It is that or you are in problems."
We get into the car and I tell him/her:
"Won't they kill me?no?".
ÉI responded: "Not I know,
I don't guarantee you anything, old."
We had ruined it.
We speak of killing six people.
You already know, these types are not cowardly.
He/she asked me if he/she had a he/she arms
and I told him/her that yes.
But he/she had two.
He/she had one of back
in the left leg.
We went until Holiday Inn
in the freeway 95.
I look and I see to four types leave the car.
I asked: ?" Are they?".
"Yes, but there is more to your left."
I looked and there were four more than the other side.
I came closer to the oldest type.
"?Are You Rivi?"
"Yes", I told him/her.
"They come with me."
We get into the car
and in the back seat there was a lady.
She gave the orders.
She spoke,
nobody said,
Io that she said made.
Their husband was ahead.
Not he/she opened the mouth.
He/she didn't ask me questions.
Alone she spoke,
saying me what to make.
She is the one that has the power.
A woman is speaking this way to me
and he/she should have said him/her
that he/she left to the shit,
but I thought: "No, not."
He/she asked me if it was the one that there was
wornout the blow.
"In certain way yes", I told him/her.
He/she told me: Months "ago
that we are looking for them
"and it is the first time that we see" them.
And me Io had ruined.
He/she tells me: I will tell "you what to make.
Find them
"and kill them for me.
We will be this way by hand.
"The two siblings" interest me.
To the other ones four will kill them
to be sat down in the table.
"?lban to kill to other 4 to liquidate at 2?"
He/she told me that he/she made this way the things.
"To liquidate to the whole table.
To come undone of all."
I was surprised that.
I say, he/she spoke of murdering as...
I asked him/her him to give me one week
and that he/she would find them.
"When you find them, Ilámame.
"I will give you 50.000 dollars for each one."
When I returned I asked questions to Thin.
"? Who is this lady?"
He/she tells me: He/she Is "the Godmother."
"? Do you want to be more than the Godmother?"
He/she said that he/she knew it of Colombia
and that it was very dangerous.
"If you don't complete, it will order you to kill."
She was the biggest in that time.
He/she was the Godmother of the traffic of cocaine.
I return to the hotel,
and I count the boys.
Vanegas was there, and I told them
that we were in serious problems.
"If we don't find them
we will have to release ourselves,
"because they will look for us...
"this way me Io noticed."
Vanegas...
he/she says that he/she can
to find the one bigger than them.
"It is all Io that we need, to one."
Through him, we find to the other one.
I told him/her that Io Ilamara to the search
and that it fixed an encounter that night.
"We will kidnap him
"and Io will give to this people."
We call, nobody answered.
On the following day, same Io.
To the third day they didn't answer
and it was losing the hope.
To the fourth day, they answer.
We are in being
in Ramada Inn.
We told him/her that we had weapons
and explosive to sell.
But when Ilegó to the hotel,
Io made with its son of 15 anuses.
Not we had the boy.
Vanegas was intelligent
and you Io Ilevó to the car.
If we would not have to have ourselves him Ilevado.
He/she speaks with Vanegas, he/she laughs.
I am hidden,
and when Vanegas opens the cajuela
I leave and I put him/her the weapon in the ribs.
I tell him/her: I was looking for" "you.
"I don't owe you anything, he/she tells me.
"No. Somebody more it looks for you.
"There is a lady looking for you.
"You Ilama Griselda Blanco."
"That fat dog, I don't owe him/her anything", he/she says.
Cumbamba kicked him/her the face
and it removed him/her the teeth.
"It shows respect for the lady.
"Tell it to him when you see it,
we work for her."
It became pale. He/she added: You will see "it
"in a couple of hours."
There it began to tremble.
One hour later Ilegan and you Io Ilevan.
The following day I am at home at 16.00 o'clock.
She enters in my house,
he/she enters as if it was the owner.
My wife was cooking.
And he/she says: "I love the fish."
He/she was eating
while I was how Io killed--
Io cut in pieces--
everything while we had dinner.
I said: ?"Did it shoot him/her?".
He/she said: "Yes, I shot him/her...
"and Cumbamba Io cut,
"Io put in a box
and Io wrapped for gift
"with a monkey, and Io we leave
"to some blocks of here, in the freeway."
I said: ?"In my neighborhood?".
"Yes, he/she said.
"We went toward the south to come to visit one another
"and we saw that it was
a good place to throw it."
I looked at it and I asked him/her if he/she joked.
And he/she said: "No, it is seriously."
I said: ?" Does Io always make?".
He/she said that yes that he liked it.
He likes us to cut people
and that we throw this way them.
Griselda Blanco grew with his mother
in Medellín, they were very poor.
He/she was a prostitute.
Their criminal life began as pickpocket
and then they moved to New York.
There he/she entered in the business of the drug.
I heard their name for the first time
at the end of 1973.
In the confidential information
she appeared like a threat
for EE UU.
Their business grew.
He/she was a Colombian important trafficker.
Rafa and Griselda were friends of the childhood.
For that reason Rafa gave him/her everything.
By the middle of the 70, they accused her
in a case of cocaine
very big in New York,
maybe the biggest in that moment,
and after that he/she escaped and he/she escaped.
He/she put on in search and it captures.
The track lost him/her
from the moment of the accusation
until they transferred me to Miami.
Not we know
with certainty when it was in Miami.
Maybe in the 78, non Io knew
because he/she was a fugitive.
But we knew that it was dealing.
In the Latin deep culture, it is not common
that a woman is
the head of their own organization,
so I suppose
that he/she will have been an evil woman.
Griselda should prove the Colombians
that it was worthwhile to maintain
the businesses with her.
He liked people to fear it.
And they feared it.
People were him/her so afraid
that their reputation
it preceded it where it was.
I made the error
of not knowing who was at the beginning.
I met her in the department of Rafa,
I adored the Latins,
and I asked to Rafa who was.
And Rafa told me
that I could not go to bed with her.
I asked why not and he/she told me:
"If you go to bed with her,
I will have to kill her."
Then I asked to Max
who she was.
And he/she began to be
all those histories.
It was hypochondriac.
Quite decadent.
A Ferrari was bought
for Christmas for 80.000 dollars.
It collected wealth.
Their gifts of Christmas
they were always expensive.
Eva Perón ring...
jewels and other things.
It consumed and it abused of the drugs.
He/she was also lesbian.
Paranoiac.
Worse than the movies.
Not even < i > Mlaml Vlce < /i>
it was so extravagant.
He/she had bigger three children.
To last Io Ilamaron
Michael Corleone Sepúlveda
Io that is incredible.
Their murders!skies!
Ilamaban the Black Widow
because he/she had murdered
to a couple of husbands,
or he/she had made them kill.
It cut them literally the throat
after going to bed with them.
Not I know how many times Io made.
"Non Io will make because Rafa will tell him/her
"you already know--" and Max said:
"He/she will give same" Io.
It could be annoying
one night and if you sleep with her
it will cut you the throat. ? What will it happen?
There will be a war.
She was worse than anyone man
involved in this.
The first homicide of fame
in that was involved, it was in Dadeland.
There people of Griselda
he/she entered to the liquor store and it flew him/her the head.
Good, half of her.
Of course, it was in July of 1979.
I believe that he died for a swig.
That was Io that established it
as the more violent well-known trafficker.
AIlí began the wars of the cocaine.
And we begin to see more homicides.
The paper of Griselda Blanco
it was very prominent
in Io that Ilamamos
the Wars of the Cocaine.
He/she murdered many Colombians and Cuban
to obtain their position in the life.
Wherever that they go
Ilevan their special mark of savagery.
This well-known woman as the Godmother...
it was the responsible one
of most of the murders
happened in Florida of the South in those days.
In the anuses 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1982
she murdered in Dade County.
Griselda Blanco was...
the angel of the death.
Not I know about any organization
to the one that are attributed so many murders
as to Griselda. Non Io knows.
It could be for simple things.
If it was in a restaurant
the previous night...
As when we were
to The Peroz in the beach.
He/she could be eating
and the owner gave him/her problems or something like that.
There was an enormous type,
he/she began to speak pavadas.
And he/she spent of alive with her.
And she says: "To the shit with the owner,
"I will destroy him/her the business."
And we left.
Some types passed in motorcycles
they occurred turn
and they began to shoot
to those that waited
to enter to the place.
And then Io lead Ilenaron
fair in the door.
They were about accusing me
but it was outside of the city.
He/she will have entered with mistaken people.
Riverita became
in the main assassin of Griselda.
It was always with me and other three.
- He/she had an army with her.
- A cast of mischievous.
Their people were... almost as of movie.
- He/she Had Paco.
- Paco Sepúlveda.
Diego Sepúlveda. Toto.
Carlos Vanegas. Alonso Ayala.
A panda of scruffy.
As the gang that didn't shoot well.
Uber, Guillermo, Velásquez.
Alone they killed people.
Cumbamba.
Monteco, Diego Escobar.
Oscar Mario.
Brave Jaime.
They were bodyguard and assassins.
They lived off this.
Some are farmaceutas,
other trash cans,
and these they were murderous.
It was all Io that made.
Dog Castro was his main assassin.
For me it was one of the best
that Griselda had.
It is a legend,
it always caught their man.
Osvaldo, son of Griselda.
Then he/she had 15 anuses.
He/she wanted to live quick.
It carried weapons and all that.
It moved 300 and 400 kilos of cocaine per month.
Everything orchestrated by their mother.
He/she wanted to be similar to Don Corleone,
he/she wanted to act as him, and Io made this way.
He/she had cockerel attitude, due to their mother.
It was in the club night Faces
with their friends and their girlfriend.
Dog lived close.
And Osvaldo thought:
"I will stay here,
"in the house of Dog."
It managed the car until the entrance
almost until the door, skidding
and making noise.
Then Dog came out.
And he/she told him/her that he/she left.
He/she told him/her that if it didn't allow him/her to spend the night
it would count their mother.
And Dog told him/her:
"I care a carajo.
"I care a carajo your mom,
"tell to your mom that leaves to the shit."
Dog Io kicked in the ass and he/she told him/her
that he/she entered in the car
and that he/she left.
"Tell to your mom that I kicked your ass."
The boy returned and it counted his mom.
One of the things with her was
that one could not play their children.
Not it cared who was,
the person would die.
There was always somebody he/she made something bad.
If Io made or not, it was reason so that her
he/she had problems with them.
That Ilamó takes a long time to the house.
"Tell him/her that we are in war,
"that he/she is no longer my friend, he/she is my enemy.
"So if Io sees, shoot him/her."
Rivi and their people were in that area.
Not it will be easy, because he was good.
If we make a mistake, Io loses
or he/she murders us.
Rivi, the driver
and another gunman went in a van.
I will make the shots.
He/she had a M16.
I tell to the driver: "Come closer,
"of window to window,
"and I will shoot for the door."
He/she knew that if he/she opened the door
in movement, he would realize.
He/she knew all the tricks.
Dog opened the door of the garage,
it left toward the street 168
and then it rotated toward the national one 1.
In the national one 1 had a traffic light
at some 800m of distance.
We had a lot of time.
It is here where they
to reach Dog, to put on in parallel,
going to the west. Them to the left,
Dog to the right.
I took the machine gun
and I shot to the wheels
trying to fly them.
It lost the control of the car
and almost it collides with a wall,
but Io controlled.
He/she returned to the road.
In that moment they came closer
to the national one 1.
There we were, near the red light.
There was a gas station to the right.
When coming closer to the national one 1
Dog cuts for the gas station,
they go enough express,
he/she leaves to the north for the national one 1,
and there it loses to the type that shot him/her.
We look for for all sides, non Io saw.
We left and we said:
"We ruin" it.
Griselda me Ilama the following day.
And he/she says: They "murdered their son.
"He/she was sleeping in the back part
"and the bullets crossed the cajuela
"and they gave him/her in the head."
I told him/her that non Io saw,
because of having him fact
we had never played that car.
He/she told me: It asked "me him to tell you
"that it will catch you, because he/she saw" you.
I told him/her that it was well.
Dog was a federal fugitive.
It was wrapped in the traffic
and there was an arrest order
of the Antidrug Agency.
For that reason he/she didn't go
to denounce the fact to the police.
He/she returned to their house,
it put to the baby in the bathtub.
Ilenó of ice
Io could preserve this way the whole afternoon.
ÉI and their wife
the whole afternoon Ilorando happened
with the baby in the bathtub.
The following day, Ilamaron to the police
to warn us where the body to find.
These are Ilamadas that Jesús made
to the room of complaints.
"Please,
I have just left the body without life
"of the baby that you/they killed yesterday.
"Excuse, yesterday some bandits
"in a white van
"they shot me with a machine gun
"and the boy was seated and Io killed
"in the avenue Seventh and the street 53.
"The boy's body that you/they killed yesterday,
"the bandits."
This is the mosque
where they left
the body of Johnnie Castro.
Dog looked for the church
where they had confirmed
to Johnnie months before.
Not he/she could find it
and this was Io better than it got.
He/she found this mosque
in the same neighborhood.
The boy was wrapped in a sheet.
There were three roses in their hands.
A rose for each anus of life,
and I believe that a passport.
Here it is.
He/she knew that they needed the passport
to prove who was.
He/she was born March 10 1979,
so he/she almost had three anuses...
almost three anuses.
We realized that it was Colombian
for the passport, etc.
We call the sergeant Singleton,
of CENTAC and to their people.
We knew that it was
Griselda Blanco and their people.
We obtained the name of Riverita,
but he/she swims in short,
not even a picture
that he/she says: "This is the one that we look for."
Anything of that.
I don't remember another case
where they killed a boy.
To small Johnnie Castro
Io killed to be close
of their father, a looked for Colombian
for some of the Horsemen of the Cocaine.
I was a policeman beginner.
He/she made less than an anus that was there
and my son had
almost the same age then.
People ask me
if it bothers me to see the bodies.
Never, except for this case.
That hit me very hard
because he/she had children of that age.
He/she was an innocent, innocent baby.
Griselda said: "To the carajo,
"at least we gave" him/her.
Io not even complained.
To her... he didn't care anything.
Although the Colombians were wild
in the way in that you/they made the things,
she made them in a stupid way.
But it bothered a lot of people,
not alone in EE UU,
but to people in Colombia.
All said
that she was outside of control
and that it would ruin the business of all.
Ochoa told him/her that alone it killed
to those involved,
and that he/she avoided to murder to innocent.
The only thing that I remember
it is that the Colombians wanted
that she stayed far from Miami.
He/she received a lot of pressure of the other ones.
"To the carajo with them.
"Here Io that I want make.
"If they don't like that come me to look for."
This way nomás.
He/she heard conversations in Spanish with Rafa
because I was in the house.
"!Prostitute's daughter!
"!Another time makes me same Io!
?Now what I will make?"
He/she knew that him Ilamaría to Colombia
and he/she would ask them
what he/she should make, but this woman
he/she always survived, because it
to have died a lot of time before,
much.
And of turn to the work.
Riverita...
he/she transformed into their favorite assassin.
As if it was security.
As if it was the boss of security.
Nobody knew where he/she lived but me.
Many of the meetings
they were in the house of Rafa, of Max.
In fact, I met Max in their house.
I was there with Griselda.
Starting from there, I never liked it.
He/she told to Griselda
that it didn't trust the damned one.
"Not I trust him." I told him/her:
"If you don't go away,
"he will put you in the jail.
"Next time that Io sees, Io kills."
But him you Io counted Rafa
and they returned with men
to make sure
that anything passes Max.
"He/she takes care of Max, he/she is my godfather."
"To the carajo with Max,
I will kill to the damned one."
"?Will you kill me?", he/she told me.
"Not now, yes later."
It was necessary to respect to the type, because he/she came
threatening, Ileno of weapons,
with that whole people.
It is about a type...
anyone that enters with a retinue
it is somebody important.
Non Ilamaba the attention, you know.
He/she had a house in Palm Beach
another in San Agustín and two in Chicago.
He/she had many cars.
He/she bought them to my fiancés also.
My wife, a couple of fiancés.
In this life... it is necessary to have a couple.
What wanted, Io that I liked,
Io saw in the street and Io he/she bought.
Not he/she had to worry about the price.
Not I know, type world of the show...
That thing type.
It was an attractive type that he/she spoke English
and he/she had a lot of charisma.
It is one of the reasons
for those that he/she pleased him/her well.
I grew here.
Not I crossed the water
and I began... and they put me in the street.
Although it was maybe similar of bad and he/she murdered
to more than anyone of the other ones.
I am of good family,
but I grew in the street
in Chicago.
I was a bad boy from the beginning.
An assassin of cold blood.
The truth is that I didn't fall well,
because he/she used to bounce...
about people that had murdered.
Once I lowered the window
and I shot him/her with a MAC-11
in the face.
Not I want to hear: "Ah, murdered to this type
"here, there...".
I will murder anyone in EE UU
or in Europe, or where they send me, Io will make.
Not I want to hear their bounces on that.
Of those that UU worked in EE,
it was the best.
It was disconcerting, somehow
because he was this woman's assassin
or Io that is that it was.
During the anuses 82 and 84,
he was who she used
exclusively for their murders.
My reputation was
that if it was behind you, it would catch you.
If you escape, I will catch you.
If there was a debt to get paid,
he took charge of charging it.
Many clients said
that they were late
and she told them: "If you don't come tomorrow,
"Rivi will go for you."
"No, non Io sends."
Alfredo Lorenzo
he/she was client of Griselda Blanco.
Griselda ordered me him to give him/her
5 kilos of cocaine.
Then they were 50.000 dollars each one,
at 250 each 30 grams.
They gave him/her cocaine in consignment.
Io made this way Griselda.
"? How many days do you need to pay me?"
"One week."
"I will give you two weeks."
When the two weeks passed,
he/she no longer wanted the money,
but the person's life.
To Rivi Io sent to charge the debt.
I went to their house to look for the money.
And alone he/she gave me excuses.
"Tell him/her that he/she gives me more credit
"and I will return him/her the money."
I didn't tell him/her anything, the type gave me pity.
Rivi realized that Lorenzo
it played with him.
So you Io informed Griselda.
He/she told me: Io that you should make" "already know.
Their destination was written.
With Griselda, if you didn't pay, you died.
Until the mafia he/she would have
a class of code of honor.
The Italian would be about solving
how to recover the money.
Maybe later, they would give him/her a beating
but three weeks later it would heal.
When Colombian Ilegaron,
the beatings finished.
Those Latins of hot blood
they don't think first.
First act and they think later.
Although they murdered to the whole family
then there they would think:
"Skies, I finish of...
"? How will I recover the money?".
And it is too much afternoon to recover it.
Not it is for the money,
but to send a message.
"Don't swindle me, don't enter with me,
"because I will kill you or I will make them to kill you."
He/she said: "Kill them."
And him Io made.
Miguel was to my right,
Oscar Murillo, Born,
to the left, and I hit the door.
Alfredo opens the door
and when Io ago
I put him/her the weapon in the ribs.
It points out him/her that he/she doesn't make noise.
I ask him/her for the wife.
He/she said that he/she was cooking.
I went until her and he/she tells me:
"Not I know Io what it happens,
"but I ask him/her him not to hurt my children."
Three children, two daughters, a son.
I believe that the daughters had 6 and 4 anuses.
And the son was a baby.
I said: "No, I won't hurt your children."
Griselda had told me that he/she murdered them.
I supposed that single Io would kill him.
He/she spoke with her and I heard two shots,
a couple... Io that happened knew.
Miguel had killed Alfredo.
I requested to Oscar that watched over her,
that he/she would return.
I went to the other room.
I asked to Miguel if it was made,
and he/she told me that yes.
When we were speaking, I heard a scream
and then I heard a metralleta.
I returned to the room
and he told me: "She was about being thrown above."
Oscar had shot him/her
10, 15 times in the chest
and she continued alive, making...
some strange noises,
it left him/her blood of the mouth,
he/she was dying.
I grabbed Miguel's weapon,
a.380 with muffler and I shot him/her
twice in the head
so that he/she stopped to suffer.
I told them that we left.
But Griselda said it to Miguel
that it was necessary to kill all.
I asked him/her of what he/she spoke.
"Alone they are the children."
And he/she tells me that he/she will murder the children.
I told him/her that non Io made.
"She told me
"that they are worth extra,
"so I will win myself the money."
I told him/her that it would not kill the children.
And he/she leaves in address to the children.
I took out my weapon and I told him/her
that you outside of the house.
Miguel became crazy:
"We have to kill the girl."
I said: "No, coarse.
"It is hour of leaving of here."
I had to take out them to gun tip.
Alfredo and Griselda Lorenzo
they were opposing dead
in June of 1982 in their house.
It was a modest house
in the area of Rhodes.
In 1982 it had returned to CENTAC.
I received Nelson's Ilamada Andrew,
that he/she was a detective
of homicides of Miami.
The bodies were in different rooms,
and who made the homicide
he/she left the children in the house
with their dead parents. They found
to the girls and the boy
playing with the body
bloodstained of the mother
inside the house.
They paid us and I explained to him/her.
I told him/her that there were not
murdered the children.
He/she got angry and he/she said:
"The order was to kill all."
When she says all, they are all.
I told him/her that he/she had made the decision
of not killing them.
"?Why?"
"Because they are babies."
After Johnnie Castro,
when they killed the boy,
I believe that he/she got used after it.
You already know, to murder children.
He liked to be in war.
He/she spoke every day of it.
We have to catch to such and to which,
we have to eliminate it.
It was... it was something that she enjoyed.
He/she went to the war with Paco Mejía,
who was their assassin anuses behind.
It seems to be that it swindled her
and he/she put on for their bill.
And he/she declared the war to Griselda.
Official of homicides
they discovered weeks ago
that a great load
of cocaine valued in millions
that he/she came from Colombia, never Ilegó.
The police says that he/she went to New York.
That is one of the things
that he/she didn't forget neither he/she forgave.
I go to New York to kill all
those that worked for Paco Mejía.
It broke all the rules there.
I spoke with a person that told me:
"There will be a bathroom of blood."
Of those that kept the drug,
to the assassins. We kill at 11.
Eleven people. Mm.
In less than 24 hours.
They should have been 12,
but I allowed to escape to one.
The detectives
they are in contact with New York
to investigate the similarities
among this blow
in the area of New York
and the murders for drug
here in Florida of the South.
The war began.
Griselda took the first step.
We are in the commercial center America.
In 1981 you Ilamaba Bread-American.
We arrive and I put the cars
where he/she wanted them.
This is the scene of the homicide
of Octavio Mejía,
Paco's father.
When Mejía left the commercial center...
Io ambushed.
They shot him/her several times,
different marksmen.
A lot of people were angry,
because he was not part
of the war between Paco and Griselda.
Many got angry with Griselda.
It became more enemy, but he didn't care.
He liked that.
Not he/she knew that Paco, his son, was there.
It was in the car
when their father entered to the center.
It was angry because non Io saw.
It will catch it otherwise.
They happened to us the fact that he/she had a house
in Killian Parkway. Griselda tells me:
"Not you will wander this time?no?".
"No, I will fly the house."
He/she said: ?" What are you saying?".
"I will put a bomb,
I will kill all", I said.
I got 200 cartridges of dynamite.
The explosion was tremendous.
Him first that it flew it was the roof.
The house one came below.
The neighbors wondered
what it had ruined
the neighborhood's cars.
The windows were broken.
He/she wanted to hear the good news
that they found somebody.
It turned out to be that I missed it.
The house was empty.
It was more a skirmish
in the conflict Griselda Blanco-Mejía.
Two weeks later, found out
that Paco Mejía
it was in a flight to Miami
and it was alone. Griselda says:
"We will catch it in the airport.
"You Io will make." Of under the table it takes out
a bayonet of 40 cm.
"I want that Io matés with this."
He/she wanted that Io stabbed.
"? What is this?
? Do we change style?", I told him/her.
They told him/her "the pig"
and he/she wanted him to die as such.
He/she offered me half million of dollars.
But he/she had to catch it inside.
I told him/her that he/she would not enter to the airport.
"It is a suicide mission.
"Not I make those things."
Max Mermelstein and Riverita
they advised him/her that he/she didn't give that blow.
Not I will enter to the airport
to stab him
because I don't want to go to the jail.
It must be another.
"I already have to other", he/she said.
He/she told me that he/she was Miguel.
Miguel Pérez, Miguelito.
Miguelito was as Rivi, but without class.
Miguel told me that if the pay was good
he/she would enter to the White House
and it would kill the president.
This picture took it
soon after of Ilegar
in 1982 in Mariel.
It was one of the most fearful types
that I knew in my career.
It began them to him
to know as the marielitos
the intrepid marielitos.
Physically, it intimidated.
It was bigger
and he/she had more force than Rivi.
It is the type class that one thinks
that it could become crazy suddenly
and that it could leave the neck.
I spoke with Miguel and it accepted.
He/she told me that they would give him/her
250.000 dollars and a house
to catch it in the airport.
I told him/her that if he/she entered,
it won't support it.
Miguelito didn't care it and single Io made.
"The only thing that I will make for you,
"it will be to show you who Paco is."
They knew in what flight it was,
when it arrived.
And Io was waiting.
Well, there Paco came
and Io last that he/she waited
it was that a black Io attacked.
While it left customs
a man comes closer with a bayonet.
Miguel comes from behind
Io grabs with force, Io rises
and Io knifes.
It used the bayonet several times.
I counted 6 or 7 times.
All in the airport
they were with the open mouth.
They were in shock, nobody said anything.
The ribbon to the floor and he/she leaves running.
AIlí began to scream.
The police ran
until the place of the incident,
they pointed out them toward where Miguel escaped
and Io caught at once.
One of them approaches Miguel,
that he/she falls to a meter of me
and Miguel looks at me as requesting help
with the eyes.
I denied with the head and I said that not.
Not he/she could make anything.
The policemen came from all sides.
You Io Ilevaron and we leave.
This was too much, because this place,
even then, policemen's Ileno was.
There were policemen in each esplanade.
To attempt something like that
it was a madness, and obviously
it was this way, because Io caught.
It was this way Miguelito,
he didn't care it.
He/she had work to make,
Io that is... to murder,
and him Io ago.
But Paco survived,
and they sentenced Miguel
for murder intent.
I believe that they gave him/her 15 anuses.
The last time that I saw Miguel was.
I believe that that it was the last exaggeration
of the war Mejía-Griselda Blanco.
Griselda Blanco was the catalyst
so that the government
of EE UU recognized
that Miami had serious problems,
that in fact
we were as Dodge City.
It was outside of control.
Créase or not, when one murders people
a lot of pressure of it is received.
You have the hen of the eggs of gold.
?Why to enter with her?
Everything was for blame of the violence.
Not it was for the quantity of drugs,
they didn't have idea of the quantity that Ilegaba.
They formed special groups.
An antidrug group
well-known as CENTAC 26.
These types pursued me...
? Who rays were?
He/she not even knew
who were.
?From where did they come?
The district attorneys wait
to carry out arrests for drugs in the future.
They had chosen Reagan.
We need that the president
he/she comes to Dade County
to speak with the taxi driver's widow
to the one who you/they flew him/her the head.
The wars of the cocaine, the violence,
the homicides, the cover of < i > Tlme, < /i>
Ilevaron to the action.
The vice-president's forces Bush
to combat the crime in Florida of the South
they flooded federal agents' Miami.
It is a combined operation with the state,
the local police,
the coastal watch, the customs.
Florida of the South is not able to
to be a refuge for the criminals,
for the organized traffickers of drugs
neither for the murderers to salary.
The rest of the country
bill was giving
that it was not a problem of Miami,
it was a national problem.
This initiative will join our resources
to combat the problem of the drugs
and the crime in Miami.
I sent him/her a telegram
to the president begging him/her
that it puts to the Air base Homestead
in foot of war to intercept, to stop
and to demolish, of being necessary,
the airplanes
secret loaded ships
that they try to enter drug in Florida.
There is a non identified ship
to the west of West End, Great Bahama.
?They can send an airplane
to identify it?
I received authorization
of the government from Colombia
to shoot to their ship.
Expert, 1-6-0, well.
Please, stop.
Tell him/her that he/she stops and Io will make.
They gave him/her. !Be fume, be fume!
The agents say
that the tests confirm
that they have a ton of coca
for value of 31 million dollars,
1000 millions in the street.
The quantity of drugs
confiscated in this area
it ascended to 2500%.
The net weight is
of around 1700 kilos.
It is the biggest seizure
never carried out by the federal government.
He/she would say that it is more 4 times
of Io that we never made.
? He/she means that it is no longer possible
to enter drugs in EE UU?
No, we didn't say that.
? What does he/she mean?
? What is Io that affirms?
Every time will be more difficult.
The good news is that the index of crimes
low control is.
There is a commitment to long scale
on behalf of the citizens, of the government,
of the police and of the tribunals
in giving him/her it battles to the enemy.
!Be quiet, be quiet!
It was really the principle of the end
of the era of the Horsemen of the Cocaine.
The index of murders lowered from 1980.
There was a drop of 50% in the city
and of 30% in the outskirts.
There were too many policemen
and a lot of pressure in television,
so I told to Griselda
that there was a lot of pressure,
that it would be better to leave vacations.
He/she told me that he/she planned to transfer
the operation to California.
"? Do you come with me, Rivi?"
He/she no longer wanted to continue killing,
he/she had a lot of money.
He/she Would Return to Chicago.
In retrospective, we know
that she left around 1984,
when the index of homicides
it lowered clearly.
It was happy of leaving
because it was conscious
of the pressure to my around,
and she didn't want to understand it.
Seeing that the whole organization
he/she had moved to California
and that I am an agent in Miami
I had to convince to my superiors
that it was worthwhile
that he/she investigated a case in California.
He/she knew that it was question of time
before they pursued us.
I said that if at some time it caught it,
he/she would give him/her a kiss in the cheek.
He/she left to California
and their business began there.
Rafa didn't want
to send the product until there,
so she decided
to be made friend of Marta
to get the cocaine.
She was family of Ochoa.
"Not I need Rafa, I can get everything
"this way." Io made this way.
Max tells me: "Not there will be
"coca for a while,
because there are problems.
"Griselda decided that he/she doesn't want to pay
"about 1500 kilos or something like that."
I asked him/her
what he/she had to do with us.
"Ochoa doesn't want to send anything
"until everything gets ready."
Griselda tells me
that he/she wants to kill that dog.
"?To who?"
And he/she answers: "To this dog."
Griselda said that if it killed Marta,
there would not be any test
of if he/she had given the money to Marta or not
and of if Marta
non Io had sent to its family.
I told to Griselda
if he/she made that, it would finish with their business.
Not there would be place
in the world where to hide.
They would look for it for the rest of their life.
But he/she wanted to make it same.
I told him/her that it was not necessary.
It was their exit. "I Will Murder Marta
"and I will say that I gave him/her the money,
"and if they ask me,
"I will tell them that I don't know where
it is because you Io gave to her."
"Griselda? what will you make?", I told him/her.
He/she told me: "Murder it."
As soon as he/she entered and he/she saw Griselda
you Io made above.
"Godmother, Godmother,
? what have I made you?"
Griselda answers: "Anything."
They kidnapped her,
they murdered it and they found it
to the side of the highway.
It was spotted of blood,
you could not kill Marta.
AIlí began another war.
That exploited him/her in the hands.
All gave him/her the back.
Even Rafa, their best friend.
I remember that Rafa and the other ones...
The other of the poster.
...they thought of having to kill her.
There was a price for the head of Griselda.
They told him/her that where they saw it,
they will catch it.
Max entered in problems
and it was the principle of the end.
ÉI knew that he/she had a problem.
Not he/she should have smoked, but Io made.
Not he/she thought that they would go behind him.
Max me Ilama and he/she says
that he/she believes that the police Io pursues.
"I will get myself into the car, I will go for walk,
"stay in the cellular one with me."
"Well, Max, I will stay to the telephone."
Max you gets into the car and he/she leaves.
It leaves the entrance and he/she tells me
that they came from all sides.
I knew that low surveillance was.
The cars blocked my exit
and when I realized,
there were 40 weapons aiming me.
End of the conversation.
They arrested him and more Io never saw.
He/she had millions of dollars
buried in bags in my garden.
That night I went out with a lantern
to take out the bags,
because he/she feared that they came.
He/she lived in the area of Everglades.
I jumped in a canoe like with...
I don't know how many...
between 6 and 8 million dollars,
I threw them in the canoe, I rowed to the other side
and I buried them
in the National Park of Everglades
because he/she believed that they came to my house.
But nobody came neither it passed anything.
Nobody believed that there would be problems.
Mickey and the other ones said
that there were not problems
with the last airplane that landed
and that everything seemed to be well.
I told them that we continued
until Io discovered.
Jon said that there was not
I motivate to worry.
We believed that Jon was very intelligent.
September 20 1986
I remember September 20
because he/she could not sleep.
That night in particular
he/she worked with Mickey and their people.
And because he/she could not sleep, I decided to leave
to the radio room that we had
in Miami, to direct to the airplanes.
They were the regular trips, unique unusual Io
that we should have noticed,
it was the silence in the radio
because they knew that we listened everything.
I looked around when I left,
because paranoiac continued for Io of Max,
and I didn't see he/she swims at all.
Everything followed their course.
The airplane landed and I said: Good "other trip,
"I leave home, I feel well."
As soon as it landed
and he/she entered to the barn,
they appeared in helicopter and people
it left armed of all sides.
Lower slowly!the hands in the air!
!Show my hands!
I heard a noise,
it was as if a ray
it had impacted us.
The types that were
in the airplane they escaped.
A truck appeared
to about 100 kms per hour
and they entered for the door.
It was a simultaneous haul,
Tampa and Miami.
Dresses arrived of black
with the masks
and glasses of night vision.
It seemed that we were
of turn in Vietnam.
It was a madness.
I left for the back door.
"?Do I leave to tirotear with you?"
I had a confrontation with one of them...
"!Throw you to the floor and be quiet!"
"Yes, it is well."
They looked at me,
and Io will never forget.
"!Roberts! ? What do you make here?"
I said: Do I "believe that I put the paw?no?".
"Yes, old.
"We would have gone later to your house
"but us Io facilitated."
"Not he/she could sleep, old."
"What pity", he/she said.
We arrive at the police station and I heard in the radio
that there were shootings, and shots.
"!It is the war!"
I said: ?" What does it happen?
?Does he/she have to do with me?".
"It is your airplane, your farm."
There were shots, shootings.
They ran for all sides
shooting the weapons.
"Your friend is shooting us."
Mickey, my friend.
I was about escaping in the airplane.
He/she had a gun of flares
and around
there were tanks of gasoline that we used
to recharge the tank and to release us.
I turned one of them.
Mickey wanted to escape.
It shot the weapon...
I left to the swamp.
I saw the show the whole day.
Not they could find it and Io pursued
in the forest the whole night.
These types became crazy.
This morning, agents of Customs and of the FBI
they began a haul of 12 people
that they helped to transport
almost 9100 kilos of cocaine
toward the country for sea and air
from Colombia.
One of detainees is the fugitive
Michael Munday.
The organization Munday
it transported cocaine
from Colombia
using airplanes in direct flights.
An airplane in combination with boats.
The airplane released the loads in Bahamas.
Not it was their cocaine, neither they sold
cocaine in the streets,
alone they transported it
for another people
and they got paid for the transport.
A hired service.
Those loads were held
to some sophisticated buoys
that they allowed them to find the drug
when the authorities were not close.
This transmits a radio sign
and it also possesses infrared light
that it allows them to see them at night.
This shows advanced Io that were.
Max Mermelstein transformed into the witness
that he/she wanted to speak, among other things
of the murders in Miami.
We will interrogate to this type...
and honestly, at the beginning he/she didn't believe him/her
75% of Io that he/she said,
it was too much disheveled.
Max was sold.
He/she gave our back to all.
And it began to cooperate with them.
You Io said to Jon,
but he/she didn't believe me neither he/she listened to me.
From the beginning,
I told them that Max was weak,
that it would accuse us in some moment
and it is hence that Io wanted to kill,
but they didn't leave me.
The government didn't have idea,
and if it was not for Max Mermelstein...
Not I believe that they had caught us.
It filled the holes.
Not they knew where the farm was,
they didn't know anything about the trips.
Not they knew anything.
He/she made 5 anuses that we worked.
Max was of the family.
I never believed that he/she would make us that.
They arrived the following day,
they broke the entrance and they confiscated the house.
We could confiscate properties
for value of 130 million dollars
in the area of Florida.
Thirty five horses Fine Step
and 14 hectares of ranch
in Marion County, Florida,
they were also confiscated.
It left in the cover
of the newspapers the following day
and he/she had all above me.
People that wanted to kill me
because they said that Jon owed them money,
people that had their money
and not me Io gave to me.
Max accused Mickey and me.
Not he/she could believe it when I read the positions.
Not I realized that him
in fact he/she worked for the poster.
Not he/she knew that Rafa was in the car...
Not he/she knew anything about that. Not I say
that he/she didn't know anything.
I say that one didn't realize
of big Io that was that
in Io that Jon was put.
You go aboard in a trip
where you make a lot of money
and you are very powerful,
for that reason anything... anything will happen.
I remember the day
that he was sat down on the seat
Ilorando, because he/she had
that to leave Io that loved...
Not I accuse anybody more than to myself.
You leave when it is moment of leaving.
He/she spoke with her and he/she told me
that he was not an informer.
I told him/her: He/she "works for the police,
"I won't come closer to you because you will go to the jail.
But me not."
"They Come to Los Angeles."
"No, I am well where I am", I told him/her.
We locate a house that you/they had rented.
We knew that it was in the house.
We find it and we enter.
I ascended and I found it seated in the bed
reading the Bible. I came closer
with the gun in the hand.
It was startled a lot.
He/she would never believe that it was
a maniac murderess and it forces.
They arrested her in the house.
And I kissed her in the cheek,
as I promised to the agents
many months before.
The police believes that it is responsible
of at least 200 murders...
in one period of more 10 anuses
of wars for drugs.
Today, an arrest that could demolish
to one of the figures
more notorious criminals from Florida.
Then they arrested their children.
Everything one came below seriously.
Now I take care to myself.
All are in the jail less me.
And they are looking for me.
For that then, him and their siblings
they were in the airport
in a stolen car.
It stops them the police
and they resist to the arrest.
They had cocaine
and they put them low it guards.
I am low it guards from then on.
With the time, the market of the drug
it was disarticulated by the police.
Much of that money
let us say that it disappeared,
and while it was judged,
it sentenced and he/she sent to prison
to the drug dealers, something happened.
The businesses
that they frequented and they supported
they began to melt and to close.
The bank Sunshine State
it is outside of career.
It is alleged that Sunshine State
it was bought with the laundry
of money of the drugs.
All the night clubs melted,
the concessionaires
they left to the bankruptcy,
the jeweler'ses.
The real estate businesses
they are decaying.
That type of businesses
it has suffered too much.
Those crashes
they created new opportunities.
The economy of Miami stayed
with the speculators that won
money with the business of the drugs.
If you had a concessionaire
whose sales were
of 20 millions to 60 millions for anus
during ten anuses, there you have
500 millions extra
that they are giving turns.
Not it would have been there
if you didn't have the horrors
of the Horsemen of the Cocaine.
The drugs destroy to the community
when it is fought with the street.
When we speak from drugs to the level
that the main drug dealers
they live, they go of vacations
and they buy houses here,
washing the money, etc.,
that improves the economy
of a city or community.
Much of that money
he/she went privately to infrastructures.
Constructions for the value
of 2300 million dollars
you Ilevan to end in the center of Miami.
The general construction
in the center and in Brickell.
The authorities of the center
they say that more constructions
for 1000 million dollars
you Ilevarán to end
in the next ones 6 to 8 months.
Uf, built half of the city.
It built the towers,
the sky-scrapers.
They say that the boom of the construction
it will last the next 10 anuses.
The drug traffic
it saved Miami in many ways.
If you look to the buildings,
many of them
they were built
or they were paid with money of drugs.
These new constructions represent
25.000 new works
and annual wages for millions.
The new condominiums,
offices and banks
they will add about 20 millions
of more dollars
to the base of taxes of Miami.
While the cocaine entered Miami
and the millions of dollars
they entered in Latin America,
legitimate Miami
he/she realized that it was
the entrance to the rest of America.
The traffic of drugs
it put to Miami in the map.
<i > Newsweek < /i > Ilamó to Miami
Casablanca of America.
What contrast with Io of 7 anuses behind.
A thing about the terrible publicity
it is that there was much.
All spoke of Miami.
- Miami.
- Miami.
- Miami.
- To Miami Beach.
- The whole world.
- People said:
"I always wanted to go to Miami,
"?seriously it is this way? The beaches that I see
"and the beautiful women
and the night" clubs.
It Is the Club 1235.
It is the place where
he/she took place the great party
of < i > Mlaml Vlce < /i > on Saturday.
We were in television
every Friday
with < i > Mlaml Vlce.
The histories were based
entirely in the drug traffic.
He/she can that < i > Mlaml Vlce < /i > he/she doesn't help
to improve the image of the city,
but he/she makes a lot for the local economy.
Don Johnson and < i > Mlaml Vlce, < /i>
To Pacino in < i > Caracortada.
It was very attractive.
This is Miami, everything is more relaxed.
It was interesting
because when the series came out
they found an abandoned hotel
or a gas station in the beach,
they put lights, they painted them,
they fixed them, they renovated them,
they recorded the scenes there
and they left a renovated place behind.
I believe that they made that a lot of people
he/she saw the possibilities that there was.
At the end of the 80 and principles of the 90
the European industry of the fashion
South discovered Beach,
and behind the models
the European rich visitors come
that they pursued the models.
And we finish receiving to the famous ones.
He/she reminds me to the city Greenwich in 1965
because it is in fashion and it is new.
Then Ilegaron the paparazzi
and they created a phenomenon.
It passed of being a place vacacional
to be the international capital
prosperous of America.
The world began
to converge to Miami and Io we get.
We could have reborned
without so much people died.
He/she could have lived without it.
And a lot of people could live
without the enormous contribution
of money to the community.
There were colateral too many effects.
Not I believe that the economic benefits
they were worth the cost in the society.
I still love more Miami, but the master
by Io that was
before the war of the cocaine.
? What price was it paid by a sky-scraper?
? How much people he/she had to die
for those buildings?
Not it was worthwhile,
too many died hence.
Honestly, Miami
it would not be where it is today
without having lived the horrors
and tragedies of those anuses.
Today people delight speaking
of how they survived
in Miami in 70 80.
I returned because he/she had to make it.
Not he/she had option.
Jon Roberts left the federal prison
in October of 2000
It Returned to Florida
as condition of their conditional freedom
I will never forget when I left,
I went to a hotel in South Beach
Ilamado The Surfcomber.
The first tomorrow
I got up and I went to the beach.
It was recumbent and a girl leaves the water
and while it leaves
I see that he/she doesn't have the part of up.
They have to understand
that he/she made 11 anuses that it was in prison.
He/she looked at that naked girl
and non Io could believe, I got scared.
I ran to the hotel and I could not leave
of the room during one day.
"? What did it happen?"
The world had changed.
The city had grown a lot
in those 12 anuses.
Mickey Munday was a fugitive
during 6 anuses
until it was arrested by the police
in 1992.
It left prison in December of 1999.
Non Io knows, the times change.
In that time,
we didn't care anything.
Miami was an open city,
totally different.
If you requested me that it killed to such and which
alone you should point out it
and me Io murdered.
It is no longer open,
it is a different city.
Today could not make it.
He/she would make it in a completely different way.
It is a very different city
to the one that the memory.
Many of my acquaintances
they are no longer here.
The friends with those that I grew
they are dead. They killed them.
Rafa Cardona Salazar
it was murdered to shots
in Medellín, Colombia,
December 7 1987.
Soon after of their arrest
in June of 1985,
Max Mermeistein entered in the Program
Federal of Witnesses' Protection.
Their testimony was in the accusation
of the leaders of the poster of Medellín.
The whereabouts of Mermeistein
it continues being an incognito one
and it continues working as witness
remunerated for the government of EE UU.
According to some reports,
he/she has a contract of 3 million dollars.
Griselda Blanco and Jorge "Rivi" Ayala
they were accused of the murder of
Johnny Castro and Alfredo and Grizel Lorenzo.
Rivi avoided the death penalty
consenting to testify against their boss,
Griselda Blanco.
I Went to Miami,
I declared myself guilty of two murders.
Life imprisonment to be
fulfilled simultaneously.
I am here from then on.
As a result
of the information given by Rivi,
there were 14 different homicides
attributed
to the organization of Griselda Blanco.
When it occurred turn and he/she began to sing
on all the homicides
and how she had ordered them,
it was completed.
She was our John Gotti,
and Rivi their "Sammy The Bull" Gravano.
The case against Griselda Blanco
it turned out to be a frustration.
Terribly disappointing and useless.
It was declared guilty
of insignificant positions.
We were escaped. I believed that we had it.
What happened was shameful.
Rivi was involved in a scandal
sexual very publicitado
with secretaries of the office
of the attorney of the state of Miami Dade.
Humiliated, the attorney did without of him
as witness against Griselda
and he/she offered him/her a sentence
agreed of conformity.
When we lost Rivi,
we lost the connection
between the assassins and Griselda.
Riverita helped to create
the case and to destroy it.
One of the investigations bombarded
of more significant homicides
that they were made.
During their terror reign,
she made many enemies
here and in Colombia,
and they have not forgotten it.
Certainly not Io forgot with concerning
to Uber and Osvaldo.
The children of Griselda,
Uber and Osvaldo,
they were murdered with machine guns
in Colombia.
The proverb "who kills to iron,
to iron he/she dies" it is very certain
in the business in the one that you/they are.
It is probable that if he/she returned to Colombia,
it would suffer the same luck.
Not there is nobody that deserves
the death penalty more than her.
It should be sentenced to death.
He/she gives me some comfort the fact
that it will be in prison
until the day in that I retire.
Not I know how much more,
but it will be in prison
while it is police.
The sergeant To Singleton retired
of the police body of Miami-Dade
June 30 2003.
Griselda Blanco left the jail
June 6 2004.
The same day that left, they stabbed Rivi
in a jail of Miami.
He/she survived, but he/she refused
to identify their attacker.
June 7 2004,
Griselda was deported Colombia.
Their whereabouts is ignored.
When I moved to Florida
it was in Orlando,
in Disney World, with my children
and he/she spoke with people from Germany.
"My God, they are from Miami."
"? What does he/she have of bad Miami?"
"Skies, murder people every day.
"We look at the news in Europe."
I said: "Yes, yes, it is a dangerous" city.
"Not I will go there of vacations."
My wife looked at me...
if they knew.
What wanted to know was
what it happened with all the money.
The invasion happened before the dawn,
when airplanes of EE UU
they bombarded the barracks
of General Noriega.
It used their position
to sell Panama to the traffickers.
When Noriega fell
we lost through the bank of Panama
about 140 millions among Max, me,
Rafa, Ochoa, Escobar,
all lost a part.
It was this way like we lost a lot.
It was then in the jail
and there was not way to retire the money.
The government you Io Ilevó everything.
You Ilevaron all the money.
We went to the cinema
and we lined up during two hours to see
the famous movie < i > Caracortada, < /i>
me and other nine types, the ten assassins.
The movie begins
and they try to kill him.
They bring to two Colombians to murder it
and we begin to laugh.
Us Io had killed.
If it happened in the real life,
Io would have murdered.
February 3 2006,
the lawyer Samuel L. Burstyn
it was declared
guilty of obstruction to the justice

in their house in Sunset Island,
valued in 4,8 million dollars.
The district attorneys said
