After the Danish defeat in the 1864 war, crossed Jon
and his brother Atlantic to start fresh.
In seven years they struggled to find
foothold in the unknown country.
7 years, where Jon missed his wife, Marie, and their son.
7 years of family separation.
The year is 1871 The country is America.
Kresten, it's your father.
Welcome Marie.
Thank you.
How nice to see you.
You too.
Say hello to your uncle, Peter.
Good day.
I'd better see to go.
So you do not lose your place on the stage.
Are not you going with us?
Uh, no.
Peter likes to stay inside the city once in a while.
Hello...
Ma'am..
Where are you going?
My wife doesn't speak the language.
She will learn it.
Not only you look like them.
You also sound like them too.
It comes in also.
I'm sorry, there's been a mistake.
You'll have to take the next coach.
But we paid for this sits.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
This is no way to treat newcomers.
We have been travelling for weeks.
I'm sorry ma'am, but you'll have to get out.
Do as he says.
Are there many animals?
Yes, there are many different animals.
There are foxes, there are bears, there are deer.
Are there bears where we live?
Where we live?
No, there is not any.
But if there was one...
Then we shoot it and rip it.
And sell it down in the city.
Is there a town nearby?
Yeah, not so far from us.
We can be back there in a day.
Kresten...
You should not be worried, right?
It's a really nice place.
And I've built, so there is room for all of us.
When I'm big enough, will you take me out hunting?
I think, we can do it tomorrow.
If you like.
Sorry, I haven't had a drink for years.
I forgot what this stuff would do to you.
Out here.. when you're offered a drink, ma'am...
You drink..
Marie, take a sip.
It's get em to do here.
You ain't gotta hell a lot to say, do ya?
I like that.
My own princess, she don't talk at all.
She's mute.
The Indians cut her tongue out when she was a little girl.
I supposed they got tired of hearing her screaming,
after they killed her parents.
What is your name?
My wife's name is Marie.
That's a beautiful name.
You just come out here?
My wife and my son did. yes..
I've been here for a while.
It's not so easy for anyone,
to be without a woman, for such a long time.
Damn, it's hot here.
You're not used to this heat, are you Marie?
No, I suppose not.
There is always a solution.
Let's see what you got.
Don't do that!
Such a warm little flower.
Don't do that!
Are you threatening me?
No, I'm telling you to get your hands off and behave.
Kinda sounds like he's threatening me.
That's the impression I got.
What do say you, Lester?
Yep.
I'm not trying to threaten anyone, I'm just...
What're you gonna do about it?
You can't do nothing.
Come here!
Nothing.
You can't do a damn thing.
Sit still!
Bite his ear.
Marie, bite his ear.
Do not be afraid.
Kresten, go get the gun.
Do not be afraid.
Just take it.
And stay down, Kresten.
No, stay down. Stay down, Kresten!
Lower your gun.
Do it!
Damn son of a bitch.
I don't like you much dude.
You got 5 seconds to get out of here.
You understand me?
One!
Two!
Three!
Marie...
She ain't dead!
She been fine!
Wait, wait!
She ain't dead.
Wait, wait.
I didn't touch the boy.
Who did it?
I have not seen them before.
Strangers.
It's a sad day, Mr. Delarue.
But we must bear in mind that no one in this peaceful town,
is involved in the gruesome killing of your men.
Where is my brother?
Your brother?
Mayor Keane..
Sir?
Make sure he does not stink of booze,
when the princess sees him.
Of course.
You bring him to my house,
I'll make sure he looks his best self.
Take him there.
Did you catch the killer?
Mr. Delarue I can assure you,
it ain't nobody from around here.
I need to know who killed my brother.
There's no witnesses survived.
Witness with shotgun was shot dead also.
We lost two lives today.
One, my own blood.
I will give you two hours to find the man who did this.
And Sheriff...
I want that man alive.
That's impossible.
You are a man of God, Sheriff Mallick.
I'm sure you've heard the words of our lord:
A tooth for a tooth...
Yep.
You have until noon to find the man who did this.
Or you bring me two of your people.
Mr. Delarue...
You choose two, Mayor Keane...
Or I will take four.
Of course.
I am ready, Father.
The whole town will always be grateful to you.
Take good care of my grandson, you hear me?
We'll try the best we can.
I, for one will help the boy to run the store.
This isn't right.
I'm not sure I can make it without you, Grandma.
Of course you can, my boy.
Please Don't!
Please! Father.
Please help me Please! Father.
My life is not that bad.
I don't wanna die.
I'm never been a burden here.
I'm innocent. Please Don't!
May God have mercy on your evil soul.
Everybody, Stay calm!
Well, Sheriff...
A tired old woman and half a man...
That didn't add up.
That man's death...
That's on you two.
Tell me something, Mayor Keane...
How much does Black Creek paying for protection?
80 dollars every month.
It seems to me you gonna need more
protection with the killer around.
From now on...
that Fee is doubled.
Mr. Delarue, this is bad.
We can't generate those numbers.
$160, by the month end.
Every month.
Until you find the man that killed my brother.
Are we in an agreement?
Yes.
Yes, we are.
I thought we would be.
Let him rest in peace, princess.
I will find the man that killed Paul.
And I will personally make him pay the price.
That's a promise.
I will take care of you now.
Together...
Raul, see.
I'll go and talk to the sheriff.
See you in a bit.
Good day to you.
Where is your grandmother?
She is dead.
Delarue shot her.
I'm sorry to hear that.
What can I do for you?
I've got some skins.
We go in west.
So the only two men around here
know how to shoot, will live?
I guess so.
Weren't you two soldiers came back were you came from?
We can use people like you,
for we gonna face them murderer.
You know I was a soldier once, and it taught me a lesson.
Don't get into a fight, you know, you gonna lose.
Cowards.
Funeral NATHAN KEANE
Who is that?
John.
It's good to see you in color for once.
Are you still buying out land?
I do it occasionally, Yeah.
How much will we get?
Well.. I couldn't possibly give you more than 145
That's half of what we paid for the land 6 years ago.
Like I say, times are hard.
Since Delarue raised his fees,
there's a lot of people want to sell.
Still. you're a good man,
and I wanna help.
Let's make it everybody, stay calm!
150?
Or you can buy it your time.
Who knows. If they find the man
that killed Delarue's brother -
Well, campers may calm and prices may rise.
What man?
You don't know?
Delarue's brother just got out
of jail and some lunatic killed him.
Shot everyone on the stagecoach.
Since then...
I take the 150 You won't regret it.
I need you to sign this.
Where will you go?
I'm trying to find a place on the west.
I would probably do the same, If I was a young man.
That's for you.
And this is for me.
You'll need to keep that money somewhere safe.
In your boots, maybe?
There a lot of hungry people out there.
14, 15-tails at a collected
sum of $3,148.
And 12 percent, your entitled to $3,524.
And 76 cents.
Let's make it a dollar.
Madelaine takes pride on making sure those books add up.
Well, the devil is in the detail...
The company doesn't like the way things are going.
Are you aware that the sheriff in Black Creek
wired the federal government for help.
I manage to blocked the communication for now.
But you can't go on using
the same methods you used in the army.
These people are not Indians.
Standard Atlantic, is a modern company Colonel Delarue.
And we need our operations to look civilized.
Am I making myself clear?
Good.
Now, How long before Black Creek is bought up?
I'll have the whole valley bought up in a week
if you let me do things my way.
Just answer the question.
You keep your cavalry out of the equation,
I recon it'll take 3 to 4 months.
That's all I needed to know.
Good day to you.
So they want me to be civilize, princess.
Hell, I guest I can do that.
As long as we keep piling up the money.
Alright boys...
I'll take it from here.
Let Pet run...
Mallick?
He wasn't on the stagecoach.
He's not involved in this.
He broke Deputy Marshall's jaw. At least I'm gonna
have to take his legal punishment for that.
Unfortunately, things are gonna be...
a little bit different for you.
I already had to send word to Delarue,
that we got you into custody.
I'm sure you're aware that his been...
making life hard for... all of us.
I do not know what happened to him.
He used to be a good man.
I guess killing all those Indians in war, It must have...
Unsettled his mind.
I am sorry for your loss, John.
Yeah, I am.
But you seem to have followed him
right down the same path.
If you just.. showed a little compassion
for Delarue's brother, instead of killing him.
Mrs. Borowski, Mr. Whisler
and Joe Noleg still be here.
I won't be the last man
Delarue is going to kill around here.
No.
Probably not.
But your death is gonna buy us some time.
I already wired for assistance.
Trying to restore some law and order.
Sometimes you gotta sacrifice a single sheep,
to save the rest.
I'm just a shepherd, guarding his flock.
They say you are a soldier.
Did you ever fight, in the war?
I did.
Who was the enemy?
Germans.
Germans?
Bravo.
You have my respect.
Here he is.
The worthless son of a bitch that killed your husband.
Your beloved husband,
killed my 10-year-old son.
And he raped my wife.
No one ask you to talk.
Well...
We will soon find out what you're made of, soldier.
You're late.
I'll be with you in a moment, Henry.
Can I have his boots?
Go ahead.
Keane...
You won't be needing these, my friend.
Not where you are going.
I got a christening this morning.
So Sunday Mass gonna take a little longer.
You give him water if he asks for it.
And don't get excited.
Can I have some water?
No.
Sorry to turn my back on you..
But the view is better from here.
Got you pretty good, didn't I?
I mean, you were ugly before I knocked out your teeth...
But now...
I hope you have a woman that loves you.
'cause you ain't gonna find one with that face.
You've probably never could gotten anything
without paying for it.
Not with that stupid voice of yours.
But it's gonna cost you extra now.
That's for sure.
Shut up!
I actually did you a favor.
I mean it's better now.
Now you don't just sound like a sick mule,
you look like one to.
I said shut up!
People won't be as surprised to when you open your mouth.
Damn it! I'm gonna kill you.
It's probably a family thing.
I am sure your whore mother
sounded like a mule when you were conceived.
Damn!
Do you know how long, I've waited for this very moment.
You felt that, didn't you?
Of course you did.
You are so... beautiful.
You know what those.. what those savages
did to you, taking your tongue.
I know it must have been horrible for you.
But I see it as...
a gift...
To me.
When I'm done here...
You and Me we're gonna..
We're gonna get a place in New Orleans.
Oh, you will shine.
You will be the princess of New Orleans.
Get the horses.
John! John!
You're coming back.
They split up.
Corsican, take half of men follow this trail.
The rest come with me.
Bring your sister inside the house, Billy!
And take Daddy's gun.
We don't want you here.
You shouldn't drink from the well,
it's full of that sticky oil.
I left you some bread and boiled water
Thank you, Mrs. Whisler.
Why are you leaving?
Delarue killed my husband.
I'm sorry to leave you like this.
You wanna come with us?
I'll be fine.
He's gonna kill you.
You know Paul, he...
He saved you from them Indians.
But he never did straight you out.
Damn it.
Now I gotta kill you.
That's a shame, Henry.
We could take good care of her.
---------
Once again...
Good fortune smiles down upon you, princess.
Once you've all had your way with her...
Cut her throat.
I would like my boots back.
Your boots?
Sure.
I kept them here for you.
I kept them nice and clean.
Look.
Here.
Did you buy Mrs. Whisler's farm?
Yeah. I did. Yeah.
Have you got her deed?
What? This is all very confusing...
What about my deed?
You want your money?
Sure..
Sure here.
Here it is, John.
Take it, take it all.
What were you doing on Delarue's place?
Someone that died.
I mean everyone deserves a coffin.
Even though they ain't going to heaven.
Henry...
What?
You called him Henry.
Get the lid off that coffin.
Sure.
I'm an undertaker.
That's what I was doing.
Somebody's gotta take care of this mess.
Get in!
Look.. I'm just trying to make
a good living, you know.
That's all.
I'm a businessman.
You're not even a man.
Please don't.
Get in.
You won't get away with this.
Get in.
I'm the mayor of this town.
I try to help people.
Nobody wants a land.
Please no!
No. God, no.
You're right, John.
I don't keep the deeds.
I give them to Delarue.
I need a revolver
and all sorts of ammunition from my Winchester.
Give me a knife as well.
I'll pay for it.
I also need two bottles of kerosene.
I want you to go to Mallick.
Tell him that Keane has making money on all of us.
All that land and houses he bought...
Wasn't for himself, he's selling it all to Delarue.
It's that sticky oil.
Delarue believes that it will soon be worth thousands.
Think you and your brother
are gonna fight Delarue on your own?
No, my brother is dead.
Let me come.
You're just a kid.
I'm not a kid, I'm 16 in May.
I'm practicing my shooting.
I'm not a bad shot.
You don't stand a chance on your own.
He brought his own coffin.
Burn him.
The barn is on fire!
Do it!
Do it!
I underestimated you, soldier.
You may have killed all my men.
Be sure as hell...
So you did end him.
And all of his men.
You know we've been hoping... praying.
That someone like you would come along..
Save us from our misery.
And that's what you did.
Only good souls left now.
I thought you got them all.
She's coming with me.
You don't wanna go down that path, John.
I want you to leave this place.
May the Lord have mercy on both your souls.
