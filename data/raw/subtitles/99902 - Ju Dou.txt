(1920's A mountainous area of China)
(Yang Family Dyers)
Good afternoon,Uncle
Just back now
There was constant fighting out there
So why are you still alive
How much is there
Count it
Erlaizi
Tianqing,you are back
Don't bother to come tomorrow
There past a few months
Erlaizi has been helping me out
Why does the horse look so thin
Go and rest
You'll have to start work early tomorrow
What took you so long to get back
l had to cover
for you the past three months
Outside was chaotic
There was no way through the skirmishes
Look at my hands
They're like black claws
That old miser
pays me next to nothing for it
Your uncle bought himself a woman
Have seen her
l notice the wedding charms
She's called Judou,pretty-looking too
She cost him a fortune though
Your uncle is a real bastard
How do you think
your last two aunts died
He tortured them to death
They never gave him children
lt serves him right
Listen carefully at night
You'll hear your new aunt's screams
Please spare me for a few days
Spare you
And sacrifice my bloodline
You,barren bitch
Go,tell your aunt to come down here
Aunt,my uncle wants you
You're finally here
l didn't spend all that money
for a lazy woman
Old Yang
Rush order 2 bolts
of cotton in bright red
5 in golden yellow
Ok No problem
267 lbs
You've got so much work here
that you should have some more hands
Then l'd have to spend more money
No Tianqing can handle it
Tianqing is almost 40
You should find him a woman
He's been living off me
for the past 30 years
Why take on another mouth to feed
You'd have one more worker
Maybe in a few years
She wouldn't cost you much
lsn't Tianqing like a son to you
A son Shit
He doesn't have my blood in him
l only took him in
when his parents died
because of the neighbors' gossip
How could my son be so stupid
Watch out you idiot,There'll
be no mercy if you ruin the cloth
Make the dye even
Don't use too much
l paid for you,so follow orders
lf l buy a beast
l can ride it or beat it at my pleasure
Do you think you are any different
lf you are obedient
and give birth to a son// l'll be your ox,your horse
lf you don't,l'll whip you to death
Tianqing Tianqing
Where the hell are you
Get up here
l'm coming
The sun rose hours ago
You've learned nothing
but laziness
You don't follow orders
We worked over-time on this order
So ask a higher price learn to haggle
We don't want to lose money
Try to find cheap lodgings
l don't want you spending a lot
and producing so little
l'll go get the donkey
Tinkling bells,tinkling song
one step down to Wangjia town
Surrounded by a howling pack
No way out,must run back
You bought fertility lanterns
They'll light the way for your grandsons
Hope they'll bring me good luck
You are back so soon
Aunt,how did you hurt your face
l'm nearly blind l fell
Your uncle's butchering a pig
For the festival of the moon
Your arm is bruised too
l tripped lt's a joke
Let's go back
You are getting thin,but soon
we'll have a feast to fatten us up
Listen
the pig is screaming for his life
Are you comfortable
Now you must be comfortable
l can't bear this anymore
Enjoying it
Who's there
lt's me
Tianqing
Yes,it's me
Did you feed the horse
Yes ls aunt hurt
Nothing serious,just a stomachache
Maybe ate something bad
l can go get old Witch Li
We shouldn't take any chances
That's ok,she feels better now
l'll go to sleep then
Ok
What was that noise just now
lt scared me
lt's pitch black out here,who know
Aunt,what's wrong
Tianqing,your uncle's
going to end up killing me
l can't take any more
Let him do it Don't try to stop him
l don't want to live like this anymore
My uncle's got a bad temper
He's not human Your uncle's not a man
l'll tell you the truth
He has a diseaseHe's impotent,
so he tortures me
l can't take anymore l can't stand it
Did it eat enough on the way here
3 feeds a day and another at night
l'm afraid it's dry cholera
Zhang wants green
one Old Cui wants pink
The cloth has been sent over
Don't use too much wood
l know
Back you go
Tianqing you can sleep well with his
darling horse ill he won't be back tonight
Aunt,wake me up early tomorrow l have
to dye the clothl sleep like a log
When have you slept
the whole night through
With the old man away
you have nothing to fear
You really are a blockhead
What are you afraid of
Me Afraid
lf not,why did you bolt your door
You are not a child
ls your aunt some kind of wolf
Are you afraid of that l'll eat you
But uncle
Don't even say his namel
wish he were dead
Someone might come in
You weren't so scared
when you were peeking at me
So why didn't you block up the hole
lt's still pure lt's yours
My potion worked its charm
She's pregnant
Really A girl or a boy Must be a boy
That depends on your lucky star
Ancestors,bless me with a son So that
our bloodline can continue into eternity
Witch Li ,you are a master
l'll always remember your kindness
When my son is born
l'm coming to repay you
ls it ture
Yes The old bastard is so thrilled
He thinks it's his
l have kept track; it's definitely yours
Judou,make sure you sleep well,eat well
Our boy's going to be a big,healthy one
l have to go We can't let him see us
A wine jar,one with a handle
Judou hasn't disappointed you
A son Damn My son
There aren't any good portents
for the boy
Well make one up then
Nonsense
Our art has been handed down
through the generations
Are you wiser than our ancestors
He's the sole Yang descendant
a cursed sign and our family is ruined
Tianbai sky white
Tianqing sky green
These two names fit together perfectly
for this generation of Yang family
Great toy
He'll learn to play it in a few days
Dry the cloth gently
So your aunt and Tianbai
can get more sleep
My precious woman l love you
l thought l was going to die that day
not being able to see you
Be quiet
He's just like you
What am l like
You'll know when you see him
Tianqing,your son,your son
Hurry You have to leave now
lf he finds us,we are done
The old bastard won't be back
for a whole yet
Aren't you afraid he'll kill you
l'm not sure who'll kill whom
Brave boasts behind his back,you fool
So what if he does catch us
lt's bound to happen someday
He won't be any match for all 3 of us
Uncle Uncle
What's wrong
He's paralyzed,but he'll live
Legs are useless He's crippled
You fucking whore
You pathetic cripple
still trying to play the master
There is nothing left in your trousers
nothing
We've done it but you never know
lt's your turn now You can't kill me
The gods have eyes
They give me Tianqing
Do you hear me
Tianbai is Tianqing's son,not yours
What do you think of that
Why doesn't Tianbai smile
He'll smile in his own good time
Tinkling bells,tinkling song
One step down to Wangjia town
Surrounded by a howling pack
No way out,must run back
Home to sound my trumpet strong
Kill him Kill the old bastard
Why did you stop
Kill him Kill him
Don't touch my son again l'm warning you
Judou,take our son up to bed
lf you are tired of living,just tell me
Tianqing Tianqing
You want to burn us down
lt wasn't so easy,old bastard
That's right,you failed
l don't want to end your good times
Breath,you old devil
From now on,Tianqing and l
will serve you just as before
to show you how happy we are together
Understand
Taking him to bathe
The sun is burning today
Jinshan,you are so lucky
Tianqing is more filial than a son
