Oh God, pIease stop copying Bobo.

Take Zubin to his dorm.
Zubin, kiss?
Come upstairs.
Tuck me in.
PIease.
Good night.
Can I ask you something personaI,
if you don't mind?
Sure.
The adoption board had
advised you that...
if both of you want to adopt Zubin...
you shouId get married.
Yeah...
Then...
is there a probIem between
the two of you?
No, father.
Bobo Ioves me and Zubin very much.
ActuaIIy...
ActuaIIy, I don't know father.
You, know how Bobo is.
You know sometimes...
sometimes he's Just very cIosed.
Where's Bobo?
He's outside, in the car.
This Iift doesn't work, sir.
Didn't you read the notice?
Why don't you add
''Since 25 years''?
Bobo...
- Tamara...
- What happened?
Misha's dead body... a Iizard...
Where?
There.
In that chest.
This is Misha's doII.
I Just don't know how I saw...
What made you come here?
I don't know.
How oId were you?
When your sister died?
WeII, Misha was 6,
so I must have been 1 1 ...
How did she die?
In an accident, I think.
WeII... Bobo...
We've been together for a year
and you stiII keep secrets from me.
But I reaIIy
don't remember Misha's death.
Just her voice... and face.
WiII you Iisten to me for once?
PIease seII that oId apartment.
It's time to move on.
I know you have bad memories
attached to that apartment.
I understand your diIemma.
But...
If you don't Iet go of your past,
we can't have a happy future.
I can't figure out one thing, though.
How did a Iizard get
into a cIosed chest?
ShaII I show you how?
This way...
Tamara...
This way...
Tamara... stop it...

Thank you.
Bobo, I'm retired now.
I know...
Most of my former assistants
are renowned doctors now.
Let me find one for you.
No.
OnIy you can heIp me.
But why?
The probIem is reIated to my past.
And you have witnessed everything.
Okay.
PIease...
ReIax Bobo.
ReIax.
ReIax and teII yourseIf...
you are going deeper
and deeper into a state of hypnosis.
Picture yourseIf...

Furtlher an d furtlher...
beyond which is bright Iight.
ReIax.
ReIax.
Now you are at the time
that you want to reIive.
WouId you Iike to teII me?
Where are you now?
I am in Dad's study...
reading a book.
In secret.
Which book?
Time, Witchcraft and the DeviI
A CuIturaI History.
Where is your Dad?
In his chemistry Iab.
I read in the book that
the number of the DeviI is 666.
So, the easiest way
to reach heII was pressing...
6-6-6.
What are you doing here?
Daddy toId you never
to enter this Iift.
I know.
Go and do your homework.
I want to be with you.
Okay, but if you teII Daddy, I'II
never ever show you another trick.
Is this a new one?
Yeah...
What is it?
Keep quiet and watch.
Yes.
Oh, you fixed the Iift?
But what's the trick?
Just see.
Yes! I did it.
Where is the Iift going?
To heII.
Where?
HeII.
Bobo.
- Bobo.
- Don't be afraid.
Stop the Iift.
I am afraid.
Don't be afraid.
See this.
Is this heII?
Yes.
Who Iives here?
Bad foIks.
Frorm tlhe wrlhole wrorld?
No, onIy from this buiIding.
Every high-rise has its own heII.
AII the bad peopIe from this buiIding
are sent here after they die.
azy wratclhrmen,
grurmpy old rmen wrlho lhate kids...
the buiIding secretary,
crueI step moms...
Are there any good step moms?
There couId be, but most are not.
Thank god, we don't have step mom.
WiII you be quiet now?
We've got the door open.
Daddy!
Are you aIright?
There is no Iimit to
your everyday pranks.
What...
what were you doing in that Iift?
Nothing wrong with the Iift,
Bobo can make it work.
ReaIIy?
How?
When he pressed
aII the buttons together...
Iift started shaking heaviIy.
and then the Iift
took us down to heII.
Where?
Misha, you want
a piece of my chicken?
Thank you.
Where did it take you?
HeII, Daddy, heII.
Oh.
Where is heII?
BeIow the ground fIoor.
Every high-rise has its own heII.

Here I am.
Come on, Bobo.
Hurry up!
Okay.
Corme.
Oh ! Hi.

Somebody is waiting. Get in.
So sweet!
Yeah...
She's Misha.
Hi Misha.
Say heIIo.
And he is Bobo.
HeIIo, Bobo.
We didn't press the Iift button.
Bobo...
Where did you come from?
I came from down under.
In the Iift?
Yeah.
Frorm lhell?
Misha!
It's fine.
Soutlh Africa is lhell at least
for ln dians an d blacks.
Wait I'm coming.
Wait.
Wait I'm coming.
Hey gramps...
Wait.
Do you want to see a trick?
No, Bobo no.
Don't disturb him.
Where are you parked?
ActuaIIy, I came by taxi.
Is there a taxi stand cIose by?
Right outside their schooI.
I'II drop you.
PIease come.
Are you sure?
Yes... no probIem at aII.
PIease come.
Thank you.
By the way, I'm Diana.
Hi, I'm Sharan.
I feeI sure that
Diana is a witch...
an d tlhat slhe carme up
frorm lhell in tlhe lift.
I was getting angry on Daddy...
I feeI Iike punching him
on his stomach...
and shoving the witch
out of the car.
I Iove chiIdren.
I Just Iove chiIdren.
Thank you, thank you so much.
Okay kids, bye.
Thanks.
l arm prayin g tlhat tlhis wrill be our
first an d last en counter writlh Diana...
but Daddy had some other pIans.
Bye.
He was hearing wedding beIIs.
Let's go.
Yes.
I win !
Open it fast.
I win !
I want to go in first.
Open it fast.
That's cheating.
I came first.
Daddy, didn't you go to coIIege?
No...
but how come you two
are back so earIy?
We had tests and
then we were Iet off.
And how did they go?
The tests?
Remember me, in the Iift?
Frorm lhell.
So sweet.
I couId Just eat you up.
Corme on, l've rmade sorme san dwriclhes
an d rmilk slhakes for you guys.
You want?
Here...
Come on.
Have it.
Bobo, come here.
Bobo, the good news is
Diana has agreed to Iook after you.
So I can concentrate
on my research work.
She's a trained governess, you know.
No?
Why? What's wrong with her?
Why isn't she wearing a cross?
What do you mean?
It's the Church's ruIe.
Every Christian has to wear a cross.
If anyone breaks that ruIe,
they go straight to heII.
You mean you don't Iike Diana.
Why Bobo... what's wrong with her?
She's a witch from heII.
Bobo!
Bobo, come back here!
It's okay.
Here it is.
To preserve her eviI powers,
a witch has to sacrifice a chiId.
Every Ieap year.
It's every fourth year
that has an extra day.
Means?
Leap year.
Is this a Ieap year?
Yes.
Has she come to kiII us?
Yes, but don't worry.
As Iong as I'm around,
I won't Iet her do anything.
Let's teII Daddy.
No.
It's pointIess teIIing him anything.
PIease teII Daddy.
No.
UnIess he sees it with his own eyes,
he won't accept it.
We have to coIIect proof.
We have to watch the
witch aII the time.
And remember, aIways be aIert.
In the beginning, Diana used to come
by Just in the mornings and evenings.
But IittIe by IittIe, she started
hanging around aII the time.
This is your Iunch...
What happened, Bobo?
Diana wouId spend hours
in dad's study after dinner.
She'd pIay Ioud music.
So that their voices couIdn't
be heard outside.
Diana is constantIy trying to win us
over with aII kinds of devices.
According to the book...
a dermon lords over tlhe day...
and a witch is
the empress of the night.
The reaI form of
a witch is beautifuI and scary.
Dense hair Iike cIouds
over angIe Iike face.
Twisted Iegs and hands
Ionger than the body.
Ancient schoIars said..
..that a witch's strength
Iies in her braid.
And a demon's power Iies in his neck.
Bye-bye.
The book aIso said that a witch...
can perform eviI activities between
midnight and 4 am.
That's why Diana was
never home at night.
I had to catch her red-handed.
Let's end the meetings of
coming and going daiIy.
et's get rmarried tlhen.
What?
Don't be siIIy, Sharan.
Bye.
- Bye.
After that night,
the witch grew aIert and wary.
A cat and mouse game
began between us.
The moot question, however...
was which one of us was the hunter
and which one the hunted.
Gramps...
you need to improve
your acting skiIIs on pIaying oId.
ast tirme l slhowred you a trick,
l cauglht your eyes rmovin g.
Bobo, come on, Iet's go.
Lisa...
Lisa Dutt.
Weren't you in Arthur Road JaiI?
You were supposed to be hanged.
They Iet you go?
Or did you escape?
Sorry, madam.
It's his seniIity acting up.
He's past ninety.
It's okay.
- Come Bobo.
- Come Bobo.
Gramps, who is Lisa?
PIease teII me
who is Lisa Dutt?
Witch !
Finally l lhad a stron g lead.
Next day at schooI,
I was desperate to get back home.
I wanted to ask
Gramps about Lisa Dutt.
Dad.
Dad.
Bobo, what happened?
Bobo.
Bobo, what happened?
Bobo, what happened?
She became a Iizard
and attacked me!
Bobo, what happened?
Who did this?
The witch did it.
What happened?
A Iizard feII on him
and he got spooked.
You okay, dear?
Good boy.
Now I'm sure you'II become
a great magician when you grow up.
A Iizard faIIing is
a sign of good Iuck.
It was you who feII on me.
Not a Iizard.
Bobo!
You killed tlhe old rman on tlhe tlhird
floor an d nowr you wrant to kill rme!
That's enough, Bobo.
Mind your Ianguage.
et rme lhan dle tlhis.
Bobo.
Bobo, why do you hate me so much?
You are a witch.
Who has come up
from heII.
I have seen you change
into a Iizard.
Is this the way you speak to eIders?
Say sorry, come on.
No.
Say sorry.
No, I won't.
Say sorry.
Time, Witchcraft and the DeviI.
Where did he get this?
Frorm a wraste paper ven dor.
Wow!
And his ambition is to
become a magician?
Why don't you ask him?
Bobo?
I've been hypnotised
to another dimension.
Very nice.
Why on earth wouId a professor's son
want to become a magician?
To be honest, Doc, he's very good.
Look Sharan...
I'm sorry but what shouId I say...
it's quite a crazy book...
it's feeding his fantasies
and anxieties.
et's Just keep it out
of reaclh for nowr.
He's at a sensitive age,
he is Just 1 1 .
It's not advisabIe to
start a therapy now.
May be...
he stiII can't forget
the Ioss of his mother.
That is why...
he's inventing aII kinds of reasons
to avoid accepting you in his Iife.
I'm sure, your Iove and
time wiII win him over.
ike daddy even Dr. Palit disrmissed
rmy side of tlhe story...
he arranged for counseIing..
I'm in schooI with the counseIor.
Everyday l arm told tlhat it's all a
figrment of rmy irmagination.
Everything, even the Iift going
beIow the ground fIoor and...
Diana transforming into a Iizard.
GraduaIIy I started doubting myseIf.
Was it all really a
figrment of rmy irmagination?
A haIIucination?
Daddy gave us a surprise,
he got married.
Very speciaI.
We were supposed to be
a happy famiIy now.
See this, a very oId one...
- MostIy from 1 3th or 1 4th century.
- Show.
Careful, it's very slharp.
It can behead your enemy
in one stroke.
Careful...
Just Joking.
I've started pretending to Iike Diana.
Happy birthday to you.
Today is Diana's birthday...
which comes onIy once in four years.
February 29th.
Bobo.
Happy birthday to you.
Listen...
I'm taking a taxi for the meeting.
Why don't you bring the kids straight
to the restaurant?
930 shouId be good.
Many happy returns of the day.
Thank you.
Bye.
Bobo, you want to pIay hide and seek?
No, I'm watching the ecIipse.
PIease.
PIease Bobo.
Wow, the moon is turning into red.
OnIy one game.

Don't be afraid.
You don't remember.
I've come here to remind you.
Corme.
No.
Daddy.
Daddy.
Daddy.
Daddy...
Daddy.
Daddy.
AII the powers of
a witch reside in her braid.
What have you done, Bobo?
What did you do?
I was doing this for both of us.
I swear on the DeviI...
I wiII return.
I wiII return.
I wiII come back for you.
4... 3... 2... 1 .
So doctor, do you beIieve
in witches and spirits?
Yes, I do.
My grandma used to say that the
witch was the empress of the night.
And grandpa used to say
that once you sIept with her...
you wouId never want to sIeep
with anyone eIse.
So if you bump into a witch,
think of me.
AII of my girIfriends
are getting oId.
What about my visions when
I was hypnotised?
Durin g lhypnosis you sawr everytlhin g
frorm your rmermory wrlhen your wrere 11.
And you were
psychoIogicaIIy unfit then.
I had said way back then that...
you didn't want to accept
Diana as your mother.
And you wouId
make up stories about her.
What about Misha's death?
She died because of suffocation.
That's what the
post-mortem report said.
What about dad?
Cardiac arrest after tlhe slhock.
And Diana vanished without a trace?
What do you have to say about that?
She must be a con woman.
An impostor, a criminaI.
Before she couId get your father's
weaIth she escaped.
PoIice tried to Iook for her...
but you know our poIice.
So after a whiIe the case was shut.
Bobo, caIm down.
Leave her.
eave rme!
Why did you come back?
What are you doing?
Why did you come back?
CaIm down.
Bobo, Bobo....
Somebody caII for
an ambuIance, pIease.
Bobo...
Tamara?
Yes.
Hi. I am Dr. RanJan PaIit,
Bobo's psychiatrist.
What?
- What is going over here?
- Step out?
Don't worry.
He is okay now.
You did not trust me...
or eIse you wouIdn't
keep it from me.
For tlhe past twro wreeks you
are goin g tlhrouglh tlhis lhell.
Yet you didn't teII me.
Because you get worried.
And now I'm not!
Tamara,
you are getting it aII wrong.
No, I get it very weII.
Mr. BiJoy Sharan Mathur,
you are superstitious.
Give up magic and
take up witchcraft!
Try to drive out the
eviI spirits from peopIe.
Psychiatry, hypnosis...
What nonsense!
Hey, reIax!
CaIm down.
I am absoIuteIy fine now.
At Ieast Iook at me.
I'm Iistening !
et us start a newr life.
et's get rmarried.
Give me one reason why
I shouId marry you.
I Iove you.
Yes. You proved it too.
You Iove me.
You know, I'm not so sure anymore.
Okay, here are three reasons.
I don't snore at night...
I don't fart...
and I am a tiger in bed.
I hate you.
I hate you.
Don't ever do that again.
Never!

Brave girI, what is your name?
Lisa Dutt from Canada.
What were you up to
with the computer aII night?
Porn?
There's an offer on
your dad's apartment.
Twenty miIIion rupees.
They want to finaIise
the deaI today.
I've agreed to a 4 00 p.m. meeting.
I'II come directIy, okay?
You'II reach on time?
Are you Iistening?

Hey... nice view, don't you think?
How did you get here?
By the Iift.
Frorm wrlhere?
Frorm lhell.
I caIIed her here.
We met Iast night after the show
and became friends.
AbsoIuteIy.
She pIays every instrument
known to man.
- Not true.
- Genius.
AII right, a few.
She's a huge fan of yours and...
she's Ioaded with money.
AIso true.
Coffee, guys?
Yes, pIease.
And she's the one offering to
buy this apartment?
Wow, Bobo!
You shouId be a detective,
not a magician.
The thing is...
she's Iooking for something cIose
to the schooI.
And I toId her about this apartment.
I aIso toId her how
attached you are to it.
Thank you so much.
If she agrees to
become the buyer... coffee.
Firstly, you can visit as often
as you like.
And secondIy we can
save on the brokerage fees.
So Lisa, here's the deaI.
Are you wiIIing to pay
twenty miIIion rupees by cheque?
Yes.
AIright, sir?
No. Thirty miIIion rupees.
You must be Joking.
No, I'm serious.
But Bobo, the market
vaIue is twenty miIIion.
I know. But for her
it's thirty miIIion rupees.
I don't know...
isa... l'll talk to...
Lisa...
isa, listen to rme...
Bobo, what's going on?
- I did a GoogIe check Iast night.
- GoogIe?
There was a Lisa Dutt here
in Mumbai in 1 960...
who was sentenced to Iife
imprisonment for kiIIing a chiId.
VoIunteering for a
dangerous act in my show...
then wanting to buy my apartment out
of the tens of thousands in this city.
It's bit of a coincidence,
don't you think?
She's teaching at Zubin's schooI !
A dozen highIy-quaIified appIicants
and they picked her!
She was the best.
ExactIy! Another coincidence?
You've Iost your mind.
Tamara, taIk to me...
No, I don't want to.
You know, you're Just...
Tamara...
Tamara, Iisten to me.
Tamara, think about it...
how such a young NRI girI,
on her first visit to India ever...
can suddenIy want to buy
an apartment in India?
And an expensive apartment!
Come on...
Twenty miIIion is a Iot of money.
Don't you think?
She is Just a teacher.
So this is the Lisa Dutt of 1 960,
somehow reincarnated.
Perhaps.
PBy tlhis reckonin g, every
isa Dutt in tlhis wrorld is a writclh?
Did I say this?
But there is something unusuaI
about this Lisa Dutt.
I had aII her documents checked.
She's Iegit.
She is not fine, Tamara.
Wait, Iet me show you.
Look at you, Bobo?
What is wrong with you?
Why did you go to that quack doctor?
I'II make him pay for this.

Tamara...
Tamara, pIease, don't do that.
Why?
Tamara!

Why?
For turnin g norrmal person crazy.

And you'II do as you wish?

Your apartrment is responsible
for all tlhe problerms.
If you don't seII it...

It's not me who needs an apoIogy.
Hi Lisa.

How many sachets?
One.
Maybe you are Just too sweet.
et rme try again.
I'II do it.
This is your first time in India?
Why?
I had never heard of you.
One day, out of the bIue...
I had a dream about you.
It was so reaI I GoogIed
you the foIIowing morning.
And there you were on YouTube!
I was shocked.
That's crazy.
Everything was Just

HonestIy, I mean I got so

Let's drop it.

According to the book
your Iives are in danger.
Corme to rmy clinic irmrmediately.
Okay.
Who is it?
Who is there?
Who is there?
Who are you?
The empress of the night.
Don't you remember?
Your grandpa used to say that once
you've sIept with a witch...
you wouId never want
to sIeep with anyone eIse.
Corme to rme.
Doctor...
Doctor...
Connect me to the
trauma section pIease.
I want to taIk to Tamara Mathur.
This is her husband.
It is urgent.
She is sIeeping right now.
Any message?
Damn !
No, but untiI I get back to
the hospitaI...
I want an attendant in her room.
AII the time, do you understand?
Of course, sir.
Just give her the message that
I've gone to pick up our son, Zubin.
Okay.
Okay, sir.
Why does the moon turn red,
during the Iunar ecIipse?
Because of the scattering of Iight.
As we can see everyday...
Iight scatters at sunset due to
the sphericaI shape of the earth.
And onIy Ionger waveIength coIours
Iike red and orange are visibIe.
There's something significant about
today's Iunar ecIipse.
The moon's red coIour.
Another important fact
is today is 29th February.
- Meaning?
- Leap year!
It's a Ieap year.
It's every fourth year
that has an extra day.
In some time we wiII witness
a compIete Iunar ecIipse.
ive!
Even today, witnessing
it is a speciaI experience.
Imagine how excited
our ancestors wouId've been.
To preserve her eviI powers,
a witch has to sacrifice a chiId.
Zubin.
Zubin !
Zubin !
What's happening here?
Sir, pIease don't
disturb the session.
Zubin was right here.
Where is Zubin?
Sir, can I heIp you in any way?
Zubin...
Zubin...
Zubin...
Zubin...
Lisa...
Lisa...
Zubin...
Lisa?
Hi...
Tamara?
Yes.
Tamara...
Witch.
Empress of the night.
You know...
It's my birthday today.
Thank the DeviI.
You finaIIy know the truth.
I'm not afraid anymore.
Corme closer.
This is your uItimate test.
Zubin's sacrifice.
Don't be afraid.
He won't feeI a thing.
He is unconscious.
But I am wide awake.
EviI witch !
AII this time...
you pretended to Iove us.
No, Bobo.
I reaIIy Iove you.
I reaIIy do.
I swear on the DeviI.
But I Iove...
Zubin more.
And that's why you're kiIIing him?
I'm not kiIIing him...
I am sacrificing him.
This is our uItimate test.
We are caIIed to sacrifice
the person we Iove the most.
Look at you...
Iiving among mortaI humans
you've forgotten everything.
You are one of us, Bobo.
You seem to have forgotten again.
You're Iost in the
ordeaI of human Iife.
Corme closer.
The DeviI wants his discipIe
to return to him.
No, I don't beIong to your worId.
I'm not a demon.
Corme back.
You think you can get here by mereIy
pressing some buttons in the Iift?
You think it's your magic?
This is the tempIe of Satan.
No one can come here
unIess he wants you to.
Your being here proves that
you are one of us.
lt wrasn't coin ciden ce tlhat
isa carme lhere lookin g for you.
It was the DeviI's miracIe.
He pIanted you in Lisa's dream.
Now the worId above wiII
beIieve that Lisa kiIIed Zubin.
And you...
an d rme...
wiII be together.
How beautifuI that wouId be!
We'II be happy forever.
Here, Bobo...
Best of Iuck.
What are you doing?
I have the same
power that you have...
but I don't have an eviI heart.
Don't be a fooI.
Don't do that, Bobo.
I had to wait 20 Iong years
to be reincarnated.
Bobo...
Bobo, you can do anything you want.
You are speciaI.
You seem to have forgotten.
I have come to remind you.
Your being here proves that
you are one of us.
The DeviI wants his
discipIe to return to him.
There are two types of demons.
Good and eviI demons.
The extra day in a Ieap
year beIongs to the demons.
So, if during an ecIipse on
29th February the moon turns red...
the demons can recIaim their power.
You cannot destroy me, Bobo.
Never.
A witch's power
resides in her braid.
But...
she can onIy be destroyed by
someone innocent with a pure heart.
But you're not innocent anymore.
I know you are craving...
to become a demon again.
A demon's power is in his neck.
And his neck is caught
in a witch's braid.
You have refused
DeviI's benevoIence.
You wiII die for this.
You wiII die.
You stood up to a witch !
Zubin, cut the braid.
I wiII...
I wiII come back for you.
Madam, is everything okay?
Yes.
Now do you beIieve that I Iive here?
Wlhy don't you corme up
an d clheck rmy apartrment too?
No, it's fine.
Madam...
Henceforth remember that
this is India, not Canada.
So?
Canada an d ln dia are very different.
How so?
There are no Iizards in Canada,
but there are in India.
You think this is some kind of Joke?
No, sorry.
AII I had was one drink.
I am not drunk.
Why don't you beIieve me?
I saw a Iizard in
the bathroom and...
I don't remember
anything after that.
Didn't you find me unconscious?
Yes.
Bobo, the baffIer.
isa, l'rm sorry.
I reaIIy am.
How did you do it?
What?
Was it magic or...
Or?
Witchcraft?
We possess both.
The good and the bad.
It's up to us what
we choose and defend.
Get it?
Why didn't you Iike me before?
I thought you are a witch.
