[Crowd Cheering]
[Man]
Rock 'n' roll.
[Woman]
I, uh...
I got a little song
I want to sing to you
that I learned when I was...
just...
so high.
It was really the first...
blues...
I ever heard...
by this funny little man
named Furry Lewis.
It went...
It went...
d Let me call you
sweetheart d
d I'm in love d
d With d

Jesus Christ!

d Well, now
tell me, darlin' d
d Since I need you d
d Well, honey, honey
come home dd
Aah!
All right! Yeah!
Pass me
them peanuts,
would you, baby?
They're cashews.
God, you
know everything!
I need
something new.
I got no fucking
life, Rudge.
I can't get laid.
Nobody wants me.
Uh...
Well,
that ain't all.
I can't do things
half-ass anymore.
I got to
sound good.
I got to
sound great,
and I don't,
I don't.
It's nobody's
fault, man.
I just got
too much work.
We all work too hard,
don't we?
Sometimes in the morning,
my pee is so tired
I have to wake it up
with a shot of vodka
before it'll come out.
Now that's tired.
Now,
you listen to me.
I would like to have
some time to myself
before I kick off.
And after this
Florida show,
I'm gonna take
a year off!.
You come into
an inheritance?
I just can't dredge
up the sincerity anymore.
Oh, wrong.
No,
don't tell me wrong!
Wrong! I'm fucking running
the Green Bay Packers!
You're giving me
sandlot in Dixie!
I don't want
a year off
a year from now.
You got 29 people
working for you!
I don't care.
You want out?
Call in the dogs,
piss on the fire!
I taught you that.
I know you
taught me that.
$3 million worth of dates
we're talking
about canceling here.
This is
a fucking business!
Like Chevrolet
and Sara Lee.
This is no
you-don't-feel-good-today.
Screw the promoters!
Call off the tour!
Take a nap.
It's up against
the wall now.
Don't anybody give me
that tired artist bullshit!
I'll give them
two dozen badass lawyers
to drive them crazy with!
And if anyone
thinks I'm jiving,
just take a good look
up here in my eyes!
Well...
I guess
you told me.
Yeah.
You're one
of the best
singer-ladies
in the history
of the world,
pure and simple.
Don't fuck it up!
Sweet cheeks.
Sweet cheeks.
Come on.
Sweet cheeks.
Hey!
I'm so tired.
Hey.
Hey, you want to
eat some Chinese?
All 900 million of them.
Rack jobbers rule.
Ready?
Yes, sir, Mr. Rudge.
Hop on the desk,
then, eh?
Send them in.
Get out of the way.
Settle down!
Settle down!
Listen!
Quiet! Quiet!
Hey, how about some flesh?
Eat your heart out, Richard.
Tell them.
Hey, Rose,
what have you been up to?
Same as everybody--
Hanging out, having a
good time, staying stoned,
and getting laid!
Ask me
about the advances
for the Florida show.
Is that concert
really sold out?
We got some seats
in the parking lot.
After that,
we're clean.
Rudge wants a roof
over the place
so he can hang them
from the chandeliers.
We're taping
for our
television special.
What network?
Two of the networks
are fighting for it.
I sold it to 1 5
countries, foreign.
I see a gross of
at least 4 million.
I do the singing.
Hey, Rose,
how do you feel
about doing
a concert back home?
I think it will be nice,
you know?
They're my own people.
I know them. They know me.
They understand me.
You look tired, Rose.
If you had to work
for a living,
your ass
would be dragging, too.
So after my hometown show,
I'm thinking about
taking a year off.
Ayear off? What?
Sure, she's going
to take a year off.
The Viirgin Mary's
filling in for us.
[Musicians Jamming]
O.K., hold it!
We got 20 minutes.
Want to tell me who
all these people are?
I want everybody
that doesn't belong here
to get the hell out!
This is
my family.
O.K., honey, out.
You don't belong back here.
You, too, Brunnhilde.
Let's go. Out! Out!
Come on, girls.
Can't you hear? Out!
You can party
after the show.
Oh, save some
for me sometime.
Smells like jock straps
in here, y'all.
Danny, let me
see the list.
Here.
Let's cut " Fire Down Below."
Rose, you always
liked that one.
Well, let's cut
" Keep on Rocking."
Rose, the set's
all right.
No, it is not!
All those tunes you
sing wonderfully.
If I want to cut
a song, that's it!
Oh, shit.
I'm sorry.
I...
you're
in good voice.
The mama's
in good voice!
Here.
That's for you, baby.
That's a stopwatch.
I got 3 5 good minutes.
Keep track of my time.
Don't let me go
past 3 5 minutes,
or you'll hear from me,
motherfucker!
That's a new one.
Rose!
Rose!
Rose!
Rose!

Go out there, baby.
You own it!
You own it!
No doubt
who you are!
Rose!
Rose!
Don't say motherfucker
tonight, all right?
There are important
critics out there
that we need.
There are cameras
all over the place.
Please, don't say
motherfucker, all right?
Rose! Rose!
O.K.
Go get them, baby!
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Rose.

Goddamn!
Howdy, New York City!
How you doing?
Long time no see, huh?
You want to know how
I keep this tired, battered,
old body in shape?
Yeah!
The same way we'll get
the whole goddamn
world into shape!
Drugs...
sex...
and rock 'n' roll!
Drugs, sex,
rock 'n' roll!
Drugs, sex,
rock 'n' roll!
Drugs, sex,
rock' n' roll!
Yeah?
What's going on
down there?
They keep handing her
bottles up on the stage.
Shit!
Thank you.
Sometimes people say to me,
"When's the first time
you ever heard the blues?"
I tell them,
"The day I was born."
You know why?
You know why?
Why?
Why?
Because I was
born a woman!
Aah!
We got some noisy females
in the house tonight!
Being a woman
is so interesting.
What are we, ladies?
We're waitresses
at the banquet of life!
Get into that kitchen and
rattle them pots and pans!
And you better look pretty
goddamn good doing it,
or you'll lose
your good thing.
Why do we do that?
We do that to find love.
Oh, I love to be in love.
Ain't it just
great to be in love?
Ain't it just grand
laying in your bed
waiting for your man
to show up?
When he finally does
about 4:00 in the morning
with whiskey on his breath
and the smell of another
woman on his person...
Honey, I can smell
another woman at 500 paces.
That's an easy one to catch.
Oh, mama's getting nasty.
So what do you do
when he smells
of another woman?
Do you say,
" Honey, let me
open up my loving legs.
Dive in.
The water is fine?"
Is that what you say, girls?
No!
No!
Or do you say,
" Fuck this shit?
"I've had enough of you,
"you asshole!
" Pack your bags!
"I'm putting on
my little waitress cap,
"and I'm gonna find me
a real man,
a good man, a true man!"
I'll tell you something.
I actually thought
I found myself one.

in his arms...

Hurry up!
Why couldn't
I change clothes?
We've only got 30 minutes
to get to Billy Ray's.
Relax. We got
it covered.
Everyone's
got it covered, eh?
Hey, what's up?
What's the matter?
What's happening?
Jesus, I'm hungry.
I'm tired.
Feed me, hold me,
make me happy.
I've got
something here.
What you got?
Cs and B1 2.
Ah, cookies
and milk.
Kid's stuff.
Keep it that way.
Check my arms.
No.
The scars have healed.
I'm not checking
your arms anymore.
That's all behind us.
Come on.
I look like shit!
You look
like a star.
I don't feel like
seeing hillbillies.
Billy Ray's been begging me
to meet you.
Why don't he come
to see me?
d Hear the whistle blow d
d A hundred d
d Miles dd
Billy Ray!
That's better.
We still need
another rhyme.
Billy Ray.
What?
Remember Rudge?
This here's the Rose.
How you doing?
Ooh, hello,
Sturdley.
How are you,
ma'am?
I wish this little cherry
was in my band.
Can you diddle that, son?
Oh, I don't believe you.
What a fine,
young piece!
Billy Ray,
this is Rose.
Oh, hi.
Hi, Rose.
I loved you
for many years.
You have?
Yeah.
She did one
of your tunes on her album.
Yeah, I heard.
It's a pleasure meeting
such a dainty lady.
How did we miss
getting together?
Careful planning.
Well,
I'm looking forward
to hearing
your catalogue.
I sang
" Huntsville Prison" tonight.
The place went
ape shit.
They did.
I've heard good things
about your " Huntsville."
Did you?
Yeah. Ol' Dee says it's
the best he ever heard.
It's even better
than Loretta's.
You never said that.
I'll be straight with you.
It didn't show me much,
not much at all.
You think
I'm kidding you, don't you?
I...
I kind of hope so.
This world's too
full of bull already.
Now, understand me.
I don't begrudge
anybody their due,
I'd just appreciate it
if you didn't record
any more of my tunes.
It would be different if you
knew what they was about.
That's the way I feel
about it.
I want to tell you
something else, too.
I don't appreciate
you coming in here
and talking all that trash,
especially to my son.
Rose!
Shit, Billy Ray.
You didn't
have to do that.
Rose, baby, wait.
Rose!
Hey, come here!
Listen! Hey, wait!
Listen,
that was horrible!
How could you let him
talk to me like that?
What was I supposed to do?
If I knew,
what the fuck would
I need you for?
You just
stood there.
Listen,
he's an asshole!
What can I tell you?
That doesn't make me
feel any better!
Don't let this stuff
get to you.
What do you care about
some redneck singer?
You're the star.
Why didn't you
tell him that?
You're trying to
sign him, ain't you?
What?
You're trying
to sign him.
You're trying
to sign him.
Oh, she's only
kidding, God.
Dying to meet me.
My ass!
You dragged me
here for clout.
It goddamn well
backfired!
Wrong!
Don't do that!
Hey, baby.
Get lost!
Fucking
lowlifes!
Calm down, Rose.
Don't you tell me
to calm down.
Sit on my face.
Oh, yeah?
Is that right?
You act like life's
some jack-off dream!
Fuck you!
Fuck him!
Fuck them all!
Christ!
Come on, here! Help!
What happened?
He passed out.
Get the first-aid kit.
Lady,
this car's taken.
I want to get out
of here.
Billy Ray owns the
car for the night.
I got a great idea.
Let him walk.
Let him walk.
Let him walk.
Let him walk.
Hey, I don't
need this.
Hey...
Let him walk.
Hey, uh...
You just bought
yourself a car
and a driver.
Rose! Come back here!
What are you looking at?
You know who I am?
Yeah.
You're the Rose.
Is that all?
Excuse me?
Is that all
you're gonna say?
I don't know.
I always liked
your music...
a lot.
That's all right.
You don't have to
fall down
and wet your pants.
My name's Houston.
You from Texas?
Yeah. Poxahachi.
Poxa what?
Poxahachi.
It's got the highest
rate per capita
of insanity,
suicide,
and incest
in the country.
But it's fun
on Saturday night.
Is that right?
Where you headed,
lady?
Oh, I don't know.
The big city.
New York!
I picked myself
a live one tonight!
Bright lights,
big city.
Bright lights, big city.
You're smoking tonight!
Have one
on your ol' mama.
Hey, thanks.
Look what
the cat dragged in.
Those pies
sure looking good.
Jell-O don't look
bad either.
We don't serve hippies.
That's O.K. We don't
eat them neither.
Arlene.
O.K.
I would like
ham and swiss on rye
and a beer, please.
I would like a B.L.T.
with pickles.
Please just order
something to go, O.K.?
I mean, we don't want
no trouble, you know.
Suits the shit
out of me.
O.K.
Sure. Give us
ham and cheese--
What the hell
are you looking at?
Damn! Ain't you
Paul Newman?
Get lost, bimbo!
Look, why don't you
take some danishes?
I can put them
in a bag.
Whatever you got
that's quick.
O.K.
Hey, Rose.
I'd haul ass
if I was you.
Yeah. When we
get our stuff.
It's coming!
I'm about ready
to kick me some ass!
Take this
sloppy whore out.
If your dick's
as small as your brain,
you're in a lot of trouble.
Oh, my God, don't!
I'll give you a fight!
Knock it off!.
Go! Get out
of here, please!
Look, please go.
Show's over!
That man's gonna
continue eating.
Oh, my God!
Oh, God!
Jack,
get some ice!
Doggone!
You slapped
that sucker silly.
That was just like
being on TVi.
Let the good times roll.
Student leaders claimed
women and children
were burned to death
as a result of U.S. troops
using napalm.
They're animals.
I don't know how human beings
can behave that way.
Chemical defoliants sprayed
on Vietnamese jungles
were destroying
the Vietnamese food supply.
Houston...
you look like
you need a drink.
And you know what?
Your ol' mama's
gonna buy you one.
We're gonna put
our dancing shoes on
and buy ourselves
a drink.
Good deal, Lucille.

A bottle of tequila
and no grass.
Oh, how daring!

Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, bitch.
Butch! I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Right on.
Well, thank you.
You're a wonderful audience.
We have somebody
in the audience
who tried to sneak in
a little while ago.
She used to live upstairs.
Every night we'd say,
"Are you sleeping?"
She never was.
Where's my 1 0 bucks,
motherfucker?
How rude!
She did a concert
earlier tonight
where she personally
slayed thousands of people.
Waiter, would you
send her a drunk on me?
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'll get in trouble
for pointing her out,
the incredible Rose!
All right!
Hey, mama!
Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose!
Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose!
All right!
Rosie, we got
a surprise for you.
All right, gentlemen,

Ah, ever polite,
honey!
That's the way
mama taught me.
Which mama
was that?
Look at this place,
honey.
I'm rich enough to buy
the whole damn place.
You like being rich?
I sure do.
Someone's spreading
the rumor
that being rich is a drag.
Whoever's spreading
that rumor
is dead-ass broke!
Were you ever rich?
Not like that.
Once I went
down a river.
I didn't see
another soul
for six days.
Felt like I owned
the whole thing.
Were you really
alone for six days?
Yeah.
I ain't been alone
in about 300 years.
300 years?
Yeah. 300 years.

You're something else, lady.
Something else.
Mister...
so are you.
Mmm...
thank you.
Viery good.
Do you think
I'm sexy?
You kidding?
Come on. The Rose
wants to know.
Anybody who talks
about themselves
in the third person
is loony tunes.
You don't fool
around, do you?
I don't have the time.
You have
time for me.
You want
to go steady?
Want to
go steady?
Do you? Do you?
What the hell.
I'll just get you
a box of
chocolate-covered cherries.
Oh, God.
Remember them?
Wrapped in
gold paper
with little
cracked hearts.
On Vialentine's Day,
the boys and girls
exchanged them.
Oh...
I wish I'd known you
in high school.
I wish you had, too.
I wish I had a girl
with hair this color.
I don't
need charity
off trash
like you.
What is it?
Huh?
What's
the matter?
Oh, I hate this
mushy love stuff!.
Wake me up when
the killing starts.
I'll tell you
something,
something about me
that's so weird,
you won't believe it.
Yes, I will.
No, you won't.
Bet you I will.
All right.
Here goes.
Um...
once...
when I was
in high school...
I got drunk
one night, and I...
I, uh...
I took on the whole
football team.
You always tell
Christmas stories
like this?
You're shocked,
ain't you?
No, I ain't
shocked.
I woke up
on the 50-yard line.
I'd hate to tell you
some of the places
I've woke up.
You know,
I've waited
all my life
to go back there
like somebody,
like a star.
I want to hear
that hometown applause.
I want them to push,
scream, scratch,
and bite
to get a view
of the Rose.
She'll shove it
in their teeth.
Shove what?
Herself.
Me.
Old rich
and famous me.
[Telephone Rings]
[Ring]
[Ring]
Yowza.
Oh.
Oh,Jesus.
Oh,Jesus. I'm sorry.
I'll be there
as soon as I can.
I was wrong.
I was wrong!
Oh, God.
I was
supposed to be
at a recording
session!
Oh,Jesus!
Oh,Jesus!
God, am I gonna get it.
Do I look old?
Where is everybody?
Hey, baby, what's shaking?
Where were you?
Rudge, this is my friend
Houston Dyer.
Houston, this is my manager.
This is Rudge Campbell.
Nice to meet you, sir.
Terrific!
Keep everybody
waiting for hours,
what do we
get in return?
A fucking cowboy.
They said you'd
never show up,
but I said,
"She'll show up."
She shows not one
or two hours late,
but 5 fucking hours
and $3,000 late!
Hey, these are
real live people--
Listen, sonny!
We go back
to when you
were whacking off!.
I'm in business
with her.
We talk to each other
any way we like,
so you butt out!
Don't talk trash
to him or me.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
My mistake.
I just thought
we had an appointment
to make some money.
Whoo.
What a bummer.
Choke you up, eh?
It's his favorite trip.
Well...
I just don't understand--
I was late, and he
was pissed off,
so he did a show
about it.
That's all we do.
His mouth is scuzzy--
Shut up!
He's
a fucking magician,
and he don't
need help
from a chauffeur.
Jesus.
Hey!
Houston!
Come here!
Rose,
close that door.
No!
I got to get out.
I can't let you go.
He's right
about you.
Miss me.
Gimme mine.
I want Chinese!
I want it now!
Close that
fucking door.
I'm going, Rose.
No!
Rose, this ain't
gonna work.
Yes, it will.
You're not going
without me.
Get out!
Never.
Rose, I said out!
Make me!
I don't need
this shit.
I never did,
never fucking did.
Asshole! Move your car!
I didn't come back
for some
hootchie-cootchie woman
to blow my mind.
I ain't no
hootchie-cootchie woman!
You can't park
in the street!
Lady, get that car
out of here!
What's the matter
with you, huh?
Get it outta here,
for Christ sakes!
Move it!
Go eat your meter,
goddamn it!
Hey, lady.
Come here,
you crazy lady.
Dyer! Dyer!
Oh, men! My favorite!
Dyer!
Did a guy come
through here?
That's all
we got here!
Houston Dyer,
this is Rose!
Hey!
My lord! Look at this! Ooh!
Dyer!
Houston!
Get out of here!
I've picked a peck of
pickled peppers this time!
Houston Dyer!
Dyer!
Hi.
Keep watering that.
It'll grow.
You want to borrow
my towel?
Dyer!
Is Esther living?
She's dead.
[Mumbling]
All right, everybody out!
Bingo in the main lounge,
shuffleboard
on the forward deck!
Don't dawdle!
Whoo!
What a lovely smile
you have!
There'll be
a masquerade ball outside!
Prize for the best costume!
Thank you so much
for coming.
If I don't get
a kind word
in the next
four seconds,
I'm gonna do
something fierce.
And 1 ...
and 2...
and--
At ease, sailor!
At ease.
Take a break.
Oh, Dyer...
I'm awful sorry.
I got a big mouth.
Gee, it's kind
of nice in here.
Are all steam rooms
like this?
Mm-hmm.
Why do you want
to walk out on me?
It ain't you.
It's your life.
It's like
a grenade range.
And it's me, too.
Lordy.
What do you mean
it's you, too?
Ooh, a mystery!
Come on. I told you
about the football team.
See...
I'm a sergeant
in the fucking army.
I'm A.W.O.L.
I should've been back
three weeks ago.
You ain't no chauffeur?
No, ma'am!
No, ma'am.
No chauffeur,
not the Lone Ranger.
I been had.
Sometimes
I get scared
maybe the army's
all I know.
I've been in
since I was 1 8.
1 8?
Yeah, I joined
on my birthday.
You know...
hot food,
roof over my head,
socks all lined up
in a row.
It was
a beautiful thing.
And then it kind
of went sour.
Are you thinking about
walking away for good?
Yeah.
You don't
have to go back.
You don't.
You can stay with me.
I'll take real
good care of you.
All right, lady.
The party's over!
I had
a good time!
I sure did!
You got it, baby.
What's the name?
We've had enough
of this lot.
After the Florida show,
we are canceling
all bookings.
What's
wrong now?
Everything!
My life is like
a grenade range.
Well,
that's specific!
I'm gonna wait
in the car.
Rose, can I have
your autograph?
You find
some hustler.
You're with him
1 0 minutes,
and just because
he hasn't picked
your pocket yet,
or said you look
like Petunia Pig--
You think he's
the white knight!
There's few
real men left.
I got one,
and I'm gonna hang on.
After that
Florida show,
he and I are
going away together.
They'll bury you
in the remainder racks!
Yeah? Well, I'll
take my chances!
What does he
feel about it?
He don't know about it yet.
Let's get out
of here.
You can't just leave.
You got to be crazy!
You got
your whole career!
Stay until after
that show back home,
and I'll go
anywhere with you.
I'll go
to the woods
or to the
mountain top,
out of sight.
Out of the country.
Out of the world.
Oh, Rose.
Rose!
You got to
be wacko!
Yeah, I know.
What are you
gonna do about it?
You're in love.
Yeah. All right.
O.K. O.K.
That arrangement
is marvelous.
Marvelous.
Hey, man.
Come on, now.
Just concentrate.
Different strokes
for different folks.
What?
Ouija girls.
Oh, right. Right.
Here you go.
Hey.
Sipping whiskey.
Lynchburg, Tennessee.
Population...51 7.
Waco, Texas.
Population, 94,63 2.
Everybody wants to
be a shitkicker.
Yeah.
You...
you and Rose are
really getting along, eh?
Yeah.
I'm just, uh...
I'm just really glad
she's found a friend at last.
I've seen them
come and go,
and I've always hoped
that one might stick...
give her an anchor.
You don't think she's
drinking too much, do you?

Thank you, St. Louis!
Hey, Don!
What a great job!
Chief!.
Would you like
to meet Rose?
Rose.
Rose!
Police Chief Morrison
here, Rose.
He gave us extra
protection tonight.
You have
a generous manager.
I heard Rudgey
called plenty things,
but never generous.
Excuse us.
Don!
Here you are!
Don Franks, Rose.
Don Franks, handling
midwest distribution.
Give me a hanky.
Honey, you were
sensational!
Incredible! Insane!
The band was so together.
You just put me away.
I wet my pants.
Don't you
want to change?
My shorts were in flames!
I think Rose
is tired.
Don's a good
friend of ours.
Rack jobbers rule.
Honey, they
don't rule me.
Hey.
What are you
doing here?
Don't tell her
she's tired
because she's got
responsibilities.
These people
are important!
Look, the lady
needs a rest.
When I tell her.
When she's finished.
We've got
a partnership.
What's
happening now?
I'm just having a word
with your friend.
I'm really tired.
I'll see you
on the plane tomorrow.
Take me to bed.
You got a picture?
I'm not sleeping over.
I've got something
extra for you.
It's cool.
Dennis got you covered.
All right, babe.
Let's get out of here.
When we gonna get
the fuck out?
Keep it cool, man.
Keep it cool.
Hey, Dennis.
They don't know when
this thing is gonna clear up.
Can't we even wait
on the plane?
I'll check it out,
all right?
You want your
fortune told?
No, thanks.
Let me see
your tongue.
Beg your pardon?
Come on.
Don't be a putz.
Let me see
your real tongue.
Come on.
That's the tongue
I know.
Listen, you look
a little green
around the gills.
Drink this.
Viitamins!
Minerals!
Really? Far out.
Drink it, honey.
You got to keep up
your strength.
Come on.
Don't be a chump.
Drink it.
Oh, my brave boy.
I'll get you
straightened out
when we go away.
I think
this will do it.
I think that will
for sure.
Ooh! Eew!
Terrible, ain't it?
Lordy!
Who ordered
a dozen raw eggs?
Right here!
Peanuts!
Yeah! All right!
Oh, Houston, look
what the army did
to those poor
little boys.
Better let
them be, Rose.
You know me
better than that,
don't you, dear?
Hey, Colonel!
Woo-hoo! Colonel!
I think she's
talking to you.
Oh, yeah.
You talking to me?
Oh, honey,
you know I am.

What the hell
is the matter with security?
Oh, baby! Baby!
Oh, I'm so hot!
Oh, Sarah!
Goddamn, how you been?
Houston, this is
Sarah Willingham.
Sarah, this is, uh...
this is, uh...
Houston Dyer.
Looks more like
Galveston to me.
It looks great wet,
doesn't it?
Yeah, it's wonderful.
Thank you, honey.
Sarah,
don't be a nit.
Of course,
it feels good.
Sarah, don't get
carried-- Sarah!
What?
Sarah,
you're getting it
all over my face.
Do you have
a license, madam?
Oh, girl...
Sarah.
What?
Oh, Sarah.
You're gonna get me
all fucked up again.
Rudge told me
you were fucked up.
I love how
you say fuck.
Sounds like tea
and crumpets
at the
Ritz Carlton.
I missed you.
I gotta tell
you something.
Something wonderful's
happened to me.
Wonderful!
That guy,
Houston Dyer...
a real man.
He's solid,
you know?
He's not like
any man I ever met.
He likes me.
He doesn't care
what I did before,
what I am,
who I am.
He makes me
so happy.
I can see.
Yeah, I guess
it shows.
Mine was a poetry
teacher at Bennington.
He was 30,
and I was 1 8.
I'm jealous of you, Rose.
I want what you have.
Shh.
Shh.
You're beautiful.
I love you.
Why?
Why?
Let me explain.
Shut up!
You!
Listen to me!
Rose!
Rose!
You stupid--
You!
Aah!
Oh, God!
Oh, baby,
I'm so sorry.
Oh, baby.
I love you, baby.
I love you so much.
Hold on.
Why can't you find him?
Rudge,
it's Bernie.
Do not--
Why can't
you find him?
Rose, excuse me!
Madeline,
go brush your hair.
Go brush your hair.
Why can't you find him?
I didn't lose him!
I ain't so sure!
Come on.
Where are you going?
If you can't find him,
I will .
We're leaving
tonight for Florida.
Hometown-- you're going
to show them all, right?
Step right up,
ladies and gentlemen.
See the show.
It's about to start.
Five minutes to show time.
Hey!
Hey.
Is there a dude
in here
by the name
of Houston Dyer?
Dyer?
Get out!
I hope your goddamn
chickens die!
You lousy farmers!
What the hell
was that?
Did you see her hair?
Oh, God, I was
such a good lay.
How could he leave me?
Mal, what's
wrong with me?
Nothing.
Should've...
I should've gone
to college.
Wait a minute, fella.
Whoa!
[Honking]
I'll clear the area.
[Honk]
Ah, to hell
with him.
I don't give a damn
about him anyway.
You positive?
Nope.
What do we do now?
There's only one
thing left to do.
What's that?
Go home.
Did you find her?
No.
The only thing
I do have
is she and the kid
tore up Memphis
looking for Dyer.
They never went back
to the hotel.
Black coffee, honey.
She better
show tonight,
or I'll break her
fucking feathers for her.
God, look at this.
Oh, lord.
Feels funny, huh?
It sure feels funny.
It look littler?
You said it.
Littler and poorer...
and dirtier...
and meaner.
This is where
I went to high school.
The football field.
Got me some memories
of the football field.
This is the vacant lot
where I got
my first kiss.
Eddie Pompadour
was his name.
Eddie Pompadour?
Eddie fucking
Pompadour, dear.
I was 1 2 years old.
His name wasn't
Eddie Pompadour,
but I called him that
because he had this
Elvis Presley complex.
It went to his hair.
There was a swoop in the front.
I thought
he was it, man.
See that?
That's my house
over there.
Yeah?
Yeah.
See those two people
in the yard?
That's my
mother and father.
Come on, man,
let's go.
Can you get
the phone?
Can't you get it?
What a wonderful answer!
Oh, there's
Leonard's Grocery!
You feel like
a Dr. Pepper?
Sure.
Is there something
I can do for you?
Don't you know
who I am?
Nope.
I can't say I do.
Give me a Moon Pie
and a Dr. Pepper,
Mr. Leonard.
Oh, it's MaryJo--
Rose Foster!
How you been,
Mary Rose?
What brings you
back to these parts?
Jeez!
Maybe next time
you'll know who I am.
I am the Rose.
The Rose!
My God,
this is her!
Look at her.
It looks exactly
like her.
I don't believe it!
49 is good.
49, please.
51 , please.
Check, one, two.
Send.
Test.
O.K., that's good.
Check the crossover,
then bring it up around 300.
Boost, bottom.
Boost, test.
O.K., that seems real close.
We need more volume.
Will you show 53 up?
Thank you.
I checked out
every hospital
and sheriff's
office
from here
to Memphis.
She'll be here.
I'm worried
about her, man.
Don't worry.
She'll be here.
She needs
this concert.
She'll crawl
on her hands and knees
to get here.
Hold it!
Hold it!
Hold it!
You can't
go in there, lady.
Aah!
Hey!
Hey, stop that woman!
Stop that car!
[Honking]
Well, I'll be damned!
What did I tell you?
I made it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I see.
Yeah,
and, uh...
I been doing
some thinking.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
And...
it's definite,
Rudge.
I'm gonna take
a year off.
Uh-huh.
And, uh...
yeah, go ahead.
Uh...
I, uh...
I don't want to hurt
the band, so...
I think...
I think
it's a good idea
if we keep them
on salary...
after tonight,
just until I...
I can decide when...
when to come back.
Stuff like that.
You finished?
Yeah, I'm finished.
Do you know
what this is?
No.
You ought to.
You signed it.
It must be
my contract.
Right.
Good.
Been reading it.
I've been
reading it
and thinking
about it.
I've been
thinking about us.
All those filthy
holes we played.
All those nickel
and dime hustlers
I had
to bargain with
every time you
opened your mouth.
And not all for you.
For me, too.
Because I loved it.
I loved it!
I loved
getting hold
of a selfish,
hopeless junkie
and turning her
into a performer
that they're willing
to mortgage
Australia for.
You want to
play Brisbane?
London?
Do you want to play
Paris, Tokyo?
When last night
I woke up,
and I thought...
fuck all this.
Did we go down
the road together,
or didn't we?
I came
to a decision.
Either you fulfill
all the commitments
you asked me
to make for you,
or you fulfill
none of them.
Do you get it?
You're not
singing tonight.
You're crazy.
The concert's off.
What do you mean?
It's my show.
I'm the promoter.
If I want to blow it
I'll damn well blow it.
Everyone will get
their money back.
I'll pay them
myself.
By the way...
uh...
get yourself
another manager.
I don't want you
in my life anymore.
You can start your
vacation right now.
You're fired.
Can I have
your attention, please.
I want all
stadium personnel
to meet with the production
crew in five minutes
at the north end
of the stadium.
Thank you.
Rudge!
Rudge!
Rudge!
Stop!
Stop!
Where are you going?
Turn around, motherfucker!
Stop!
Turn around!
Don't you walk out on me!
Listen to me.
I'm talking to you!
Come back here!
Come back!
Come back!
I'm talking to you!
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Where is everybody going?
Oh, Rose!
Oh, I missed you.
Houston, Houston!
I thought I'd never
see you again.
I missed you.
Oh.
Just so much.
I tried to stay away.
Houston, Houston.
Where have you been?
I was taking care
of some business.
Houston,
Rudge fired me!
Fired you?
He fired me.
I came all this way
to get everything
straightened out,
and he fired me!
He can't fire you.
He works for you!
You don't understand.
He's a promoter.
He pulled the rug
right out from under me.
What am I
talking to you for?
Who the hell
are you, anyway?
God!
I'm your own private
brown-eyed motherfucker!
Oh, you...
Oh, you...
what am I
gonna do now?
Where am I gonna go?
I got nowhere
to go.
Shit!
I'm so goddamn mad!
I feel so bad.
I feel so bad.
We'll go away
from here,
someplace where
we can breathe.
All I know is
how to sing.
I can't walk out
on that
for something
that I don't know
nothing about.
My whole life
is falling apart,
and you want to buy
me a sleeping bag.
Sleeping bags are nice.
Cozy.
We'll just go
till we don't
want to go anymore.
Where we gonna go?
How's Mexico grab you?
I'm a sucker
for adventure.
I really am.
Houston...
there's something
I want to tell you.
Come here.
Come here.
I want to whisper.
Oh, Rose.
I don't even have
a sound check on her.
We have to go out
and find her,
get her to this concert,
and forget these other
goddamn commitments.
I don't pay you
to think.
Are you insane?
You want to
tell these people
you don't know
where she is?
Am I insane?
I spent four years
in the trenches
with a certifiable
section eight.
I won all
the marbles.
I played my ace
in the hole.
Yeah. Maybe you'll
end up winning, Rudge,
but I think
your little game stinks.
Oh!
Whoa, whoa!
Ain't nature
wonderful!
Hauling ass
down to Mexico!
Got to make myself
beautiful.
You're
already beautiful.
You supposed to wear
glasses or what?
Oh, look at that.
Look! See
that neon sign?
Pull up over there.
What for?
That's the first place
I ever sang.
We're going to Mexico.
Come on. Please?
I just want to see
if they still know
who I am.
[Audience Cheering]
Whoa!
The Rose is back!
Rosie!
Rosie!
How are you,
sweetheart?
Monte!
Ooh!
Goddamn!
Good to see you!
You look wonderful.
Thank you.
You're
a big star now.
Don't go away.
Stay right there.
All right.
Hiya, Rose.
Hello, Billy!
Honey, you still in town?
Does your
mother know
you're out
with a hippie?
Christ, some things
never change.
Now, now, now.
Heard you were
in town, Rose.
Yeah, I'm in town.
Monte!
Yeah, yeah.
Here I come!
Come on. Bourbon...double.
O.K. A shot glass
for you, right?
And a little
bourbon.
What are you
doing here?
Came to see you.
I miss you.
You're wonderful.
What's your
boyfriend want?
He don't look happy.
Give him a Thunderbird
and a ginger ale.
What do you want?
Give me a beer.
Yeah, beer, beer.
Coming up.
All right, beer.
There you go.
Here's the bottle,
and there's
the beer.
Do that for me again.
A big one?
A great big one.
Sing and the drinks
are on the house.
You got it!
O.K.
Ladies
and gentlemen...
the Rose is going to
sing a song for us.
Give her a big hand!
1 2 bar blues in E.
Hey, where are you going?
To do what I do.
Hey, you
with her, man?
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
Got any reds?
All right.
If you want the greatest dope
in the world,
I got whites,
reds, windowpanes,
anything you want.
Hey, man, take
a fucking hike.
It was gonna
be for free, man.
Monte, come on.
Give me a beer.

He wants me back.
He says anything,
anything I want.
He's crawling.
Don't look
at me like that...

Don't look
at me like that!
Oh,Jesus, I'm sorry.
I did it again.
Oh,Jesus,
I wish you loved me.
Oh, please.

This is the best.

But I don't--
Rose, let me help you,
for old times' sake.
But I--
My own works.
You know why?
Why?
'Cause you're

Be good to yourself.

Do not park
in undesignated spaces.
Baby, where are you?
Uh...
I'm at school.
No, my high school.
How's the house?
Standing room only.
You have to
come pick me up.
No, I...
I can't make it
by myself.
I'll be waiting.
I'm--I'm...
I'm at the phone booth
in the parking lot.
Hey, you sound sick.

Everything's cool.
[Dialing]
Hello, Mom?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's me.
Oh, uh...
Oh, no, no.
No, you don't have to come.
No. Too much traffic,
and crowded,
it'll be crowded,
real crowded and everything.
Daddy?
Daddy, is that you?
You on the phone upstairs?
Well, I--I miss you, too.
I miss you both.
Uh, no, no.
No, no, no.
No, no.

Oh, no. Oh, no.

I'm fine.
Everything is great. Great.
Great. Everything's great.
Uh, no. Um, um...

after the concert.
We're going to go
to New Orleans,
but I'll try and get back
for Easter.
Um...
You know, I...
I'm so tired of the road.
No, I'm so tired.
I want to stop so bad,
but, you know,
there's only one way
to do that.
You've just got to--
You just got to make up...
make up your mind
you're going to stop.
Oh, yes.
I promise. I promise.
Uh, you, um,

I love you.
Bye.

Everybody hit the showers!
[Testing Microphone]
Give me something.
Get ready, everybody.
[Band Playing]
This ain't
going to work.
We're going
to a hospital.
No.
It feels real good
to be home.
And...
and, uh...
and you're my family.
Thank you for coming.
I, uh... I didn't mean--
I didn't mean to be late.
Uh...
Do you forgive me?
[Cheering]
Well...
I... I forgive you, too.

waiting for, boys?
