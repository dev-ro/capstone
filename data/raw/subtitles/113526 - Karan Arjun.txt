Here is Rs.10... Hey!
Where are you going?
Give me the extortion money
or I'll have you sacked!
Keep some money or you
will lose your job.
Put it in there.
Karan Singh and Arjun Singh,
put my extortion money.
- Don't cut our money today.
- What is so special today?
- That is a secret.
- What secret?
- We'll tell you later.
- Don't cut Rs.2.
Keep the entire
day's wage tomorrow.
Is that so? I trust you
because you are Durga's sons.
But don't go back on
your word tomorrow.
Rs.20 for me tomorrow!
Father, it is Sunday tomorrow.
It is a holiday.
Good-bye!
Have you sprung from
the skies, buddy?
Never mind that. Just tell me
how much the bangles are worth.
Why must you buy bangles?
Don't bother about that. Just tell
us how much the bangles cost.
- Show me that.
- No. This green one.
- These red bangles.
- These golden ones.
- These colorful ones.
- They're indeed beautiful.
- I win, right Mom?
- No! I've won!
You win or lose in
a contest, my sons.
And it's only
enemies who compete.
- I touched your feet first.
- No! I did!
- I did...!
- Stop it.
You're still racing
against each other!
Neither are you ahead...
nor are you trailing.
But my sons are ahead
of everyone else!
- We've got something for you.
- What is it?
- First shut your eyes.
- What for?
- Close your eyes! Go on!
- All right.
Open your eyes now.
You will wear bangles now,
like other women in the village.
We just can't bear to see
your hands so bare.
Extend your hand, mom.
Come on, mom.
No! I can't wear those bangles.
Why not?
I can't wear bangles
at my age, silly boys.
I understand, mom!
She'll wear the bangles only
when Dad returns from the city.
- That's true, isn't it?
- It's so many years already.
He would've returned,
had he wished to.
- He has forgotten us!
- There's no word from him at all.
And you're always waiting for him!
Let's go and return
the bangles. Come on.
No... wait!
Give me those bangles...
give them to me.
I will give these
bangles to your wives.
- But they were meant to...
- Go and bathe quickly.
- Greetings, madam.
- The accountant? You?
I've managed to reach here
with great difficulty.
Had someone seen me come here,
my life would be in danger.
But what brings you here
so late in the night?
The elder Thakur has
summoned you to the mansion.
Which mansion?
The one that shut the doors
on our good-fortune?
The mansion, whose wounds are
still raw in the heart?
Go away. I will never step
inside that mansion.
Fulfilling a dying
man's last desire...
...is considered to be
the greatest of noble deeds.
What?... Is the landlord...?
Yes. The landlord is
breathing his last.
His last wish is to see you.
But so long as the cursed Durjan
Singh casts his shadow there...
How can I go there?
Tomorrow's the festival
of Goddess Kali.
Durjan, with his brothers-in-law,
Nahar and Shamsher Singh...
...will be at the temple with
their families.
I will wait for you
outside the mansion.
- Please be there.
- Very well.
- Who was that man?
- And who's the old landlord?
I have kept a secret
from you for many years.
How was I to know that time
would one day stoke its fires?
It's the story of my life...
...which I have always
kept a secret from you.
But I will have to tell
you the truth today.
I will tell you everything.
The old landlord is
your grandfather.
- What?!
- Our grandfather? The landlord?!
Yes. I am his daughter-in-law.
I was a poor woman.
And your father married me.
But the landlord was instigated
by Durjan Singh, his nephew...
...and he refused to accept
me as his daughter-in-law.
I was driven out of the mansion.
Your father found a job in
a school in the village.
We were happy in our own world,
despite our poverty.
And your arrival brought more
joy and happiness in our lives.
But our happiness
soon turned to grief.
Durjan Singh dreamt of
inheriting the family riches.
And one night, out of
sheer treachery...
Durjan Singh killed your father!
What?! Was father...
You mean you have always...?
Yes. To keep this tale
a secret, I concocted a story.
I didn't want you to feel orphaned.
How was I to know that someday my
past would come knocking on my door?
That I'd have to go to the
mansion which I have always loathed!
No. We will not go to the mansion
that has snatched our father!
Yes. We won't as much as
step in the place...
...that has plunged you
in poverty and despair.
I know how the fires
of hatred are stoked...
...when one is reminded of the
humiliation he has undergone.
But I have always imparted to you
lessons in love and compassion.
Not hatred.
Hatred can only make man
and society, drift apart.
Hatred is the devil's shadow, my sons.
It's the devil's shadow!
Glory to Goddess Kali!
Welcome, madam...
The landlord has been speaking
about you since morning.
He's longing to see
Karan and Arjun.
Please come in.
Welcome, daughter-in-law.
Please don't touch me...
I am a sinner!
No, father. That which happened
was part of our destiny.
No. It was my arrogance that
had eclipsed your destiny.
I thrust my own blood in
the fires of misfortune.
I should be severely punished.
A terrible death that no sinner
would have suffered so far!
Don't say that.
The ointment of time heals
every wound inflicted by life.
Before I die, just once...
Won't you give me
the right to hug them?
Right? Our lives are for you.
Karan and Arjun are your children.
Go my children.
My children!
I'm truly unfortunate.
I couldn't play with you.
I'm returning the right I had
snatched away from you.
Now you are the
mistress of this mansion.
And your sons are its' heirs.
Take this.
The body becomes useless in old age.
But you have ruined your life!
You poisoned my life!
Go away from here!
I didn't come to this
mansion to go away!
Every brick of this house is mine!
I served you all your life!
You tried to kill me every moment!
But I didn't die.
Because I had a debt to pay,
to give these kids their rights!
I won't give these beggars one penny!
Instead I'll give you and
this family of yours, death!
No! I bind you by oath.
We don't want anything!
You may take everything.
We want nothing at all!
What are you saying?
You called me your daughter-in-law
and held my sons close to your heart.
We have got all the
wealth in the world.
We want nothing else.
Come on children.
Brother-in-law, you left
these two snakes alive?
Snakes can raise their fangs anytime.
They are the young ones
of a snake not snakes.
They haven't yet cut
their poison fangs.
Their father was the snake.
The sons will die at my hands
just as their father did!
What? You killed my son?
Yes. I did.
And his children too
will die at my hands.
- This can't happen!
- This will happen!
Because your entire family
is doomed to die at my hands!
Look at this old man!
You will see the dark shadow
of your death in my palm!
Run!
Run children!
Leave my sons!
- Leave my Karan and Arjun!
- Leave these little snakes?
The game has just begun, old lady.
It will be great fun!
Look there, old lady!
Look there!
Stop it!
You bite!
Mother!
Mother!
You hit my mother?
Let's run away!
Run Arjun!
I'm telling you to run!
Mother! My sons cannot die!
This cannot happen!
You are also a mother.
A mother can't destroy
another mother's womb!
My sons are the boon
given to me at your step!
You can't take back a
gift you've given once!
You will have to return my sons!
Return my sons to me mother!
Return my sons to me mother!
Return my sons to me mother!
Push harder. Little more.
Ate his mother soon as he was born!
Now will you eat my liquor bottle?
I don't have money for my booze!
Where can I get cash for your milk?
Don't cry son.
Our son will grow into a big man.
Even God will feel proud of him.
All thanks to Pestonbhai.
I work in his Riding Club
and eke out a living.
It's the Lord who does everything.
Who knows maybe your son
will run my Riding Club tomorrow!
Brought booze?
I'm hungry. I've brought food.
Rascal! When small
you cried for milk!
And now for food!
- Get me some booze!
- No, I won't!
Arguing with your father!
- Let go of my hand!
- No! First leave the bag!
Little fellow but has
the strength of a horse!
- Won't leave me?
- Scoundrel!
What happened son?
He was stealing grams so I hit him.
Wow! What aim!
What happens to you suddenly?
Will you kill him?
Why are you hitting him?
He was fighting for you.
This boy called you a drunk.
Therefore, Ajay thrashed him.
Control your son.
Those who do not have mothers
turn out to be like this.
Mother I will return!
I am with you son!
- I will return mother!
- There is no need to worry.
He is hallucinating.
It happens when the fever rises.
Mother! Mother!
Priest.
Did you hear? Did you?
My son has called out to me!
They will come.
My Karan and Arjun will return!
I've been listening for 20 years.
That Karan and Arjun will come.
But this world is such a place...
Once destroyed the people of
this world never ever return.
Wait and see.
My Karan and Arjun will return!
They will definitely return!
Karan and Arjun will return?
Mad old woman!
My father, Durjan Singh, has
given them such a terrible death...
...that even God will think.
10 times before sending them here!
Move aside!
Crazy old woman!
Looks like you still don't
believe your sons are dead.
Take this and garland
the photograph with it.
Look at it everyday so that you
are convinced your sons are no more.
This is from me.
From my side.
Priest, my son is going abroad.
I've brought him here
for Mother's blessings.
So that he returns
successful in his mission.
After tormenting one mother...
You are begging another
mother for her blessings?
You'll have to beg my sons.
Beg them for your lives.
To let you live.
Remember, these 3 garlands...
...if I don't garland
your corpses with these...
I'm not worthy of my name, Durga!
Remember this Durjan.
My sons will return!
My Karan and Arjun will return!
Stupid woman!
How can the dead return?
They will tear the
earth apart and come!
They will rip open the skies to come!
That guy is finished!
Hit him!
You were great!
You've performed a miracle by
defeating the favorite Kalia! Look.
A shower of cash!
Here's your share. From today
you are the favorite here.
Eunuch! You'll marry me?
I'll scramble your brains!
Dad she's abusing us!
Get lost!
You won't ever find a groom like me!
You seem to live in this area.
Is she a girl or boy?
Whom are you asking?
I'll tell you what I am.
Run! Eunuch!
Saw that? He was the fifth specimen.
Before my Dad gives my hand
to somebody else...
Hold my hand.
He doesn't care about you but
you chase him like a fool.
What's special about him
that you only want him?
Dad he has what nobody else has.
He slapped me once in childhood.
On my cheek but it left
its' imprint on my heart.
But the day you get slapped,
you'll forget finding grooms for me!
No! It isn't anything...
It's medicine.
Liquor in a medicine bottle?
I slog hard to buy medicines.
And you have this poison?
I want to save you
and you want to die?
There's still time. Change yourself!
Great! Simply superb!
Fantastic or elastic, any girl
who comes here makes him her teacher.
How did you learn such excellent
horse riding and marksmanship?
I put my heart into it and learnt it.
If you put your heart
into it, you too will learn.
His heart too is in it.
That's what I'm watching.
Daily she comes half an hour early.
What do I do? Since coming here,
I don't like being at home.
Like a kite is pulled by its' string...
I'm in the same boat.
Maybe that has afflicted you.
- What?
- That.
But in just two meetings,
it has happened that Mogambo...
Who is Mogambo?
My horse.
Yes, I'm attracted to Mogambo
and somebody else too.
Somebody else? Who?
- Really?
- Yes.
- Swear.
- By me.
I can see it in the eyes
but I want to hear it too.
- With a kiss...
- With the catapult.
How did this catapult
enter a love scene?
People love hearts and you
fell in love with a catapult?
You may have my catapult
if not my heart.
- I don't know how to.
- You only know how to shoot arrows.
I'll teach you.
Hold this with the right hand
and this with the left.
And pull it.
Now hold it tight.
Who is this fat hippo?
My body guard.
Papa has sent him with me.
If somebody troubles me, he LLs him.
Yes, lame and mutilated. ********
Let's see.
Hippo, where are you going?
- You! - Yes, me.
- Baby...! - Yes.
- What did you do?
- I kissed her.
Carefully.
Threw me!
Rascal!
A hippo on a horse?
Where's my gun?
Madam, looks like I'll have to
teach you something else
...in addition to horse riding
and marksmanship. - What's that?
One kisses on the lips not cheeks.
- Here.
- I'll learn that too.
Where is the ruffian?
I won't spare him!
What does he think of himself?
Was it a terrible fight?
The hearts liked each other.
And sliced the villain.
My ears were smoking!
- You too would be...
- What? - Smoking.
- From where?
- Mouth, ear, nose...
I'll roast you if
you say another word!
Always mouthing double meaning
dialogues like Dada Kondke!
Who was that ruffian son?
A flower and a thorn.
I threw it out!
Well done son! As long as
your hand is on the head...
...of these hoodlums,
my Riding club will survive.
Who would look after the
stable if it wasn't for you?
I am indebted to you.
No uncle. I am indebted to you.
You supported me after
my parents expired.
Loved me like a son.
Educated me, gave me a job.
Your Dad was my friend.
Whatever I did was for friendship.
Come on. It's time for your
horse riding students to come.
I was talking about him.
He alone can take on a hundred.
- If you meet him once...
- I'll meet him.
You've come back child?
Place the mug high.
- A little higher.
- Come on. Here.
- What childishness is this?
- Catapult.
I've been practicing but
I can't get my aim right.
You went to learn riding.
So where did this come from?
What one plans never happens
and what is not planned does.
And what you never think of
happens some times.
I mean it was great!
Did you follow what she said?
Yes. I'm not so stupid.
- Good day sir.
- Whenever I leave my mansion...
I think of one other world,
the world of our friendship.
This friendship is soon
going to turn into relation.
Your son Suraj is going
to become my son-in-law.
Suraj and Sonia can be engaged
soon as he returns from London.
Saxena, enough of sweet talk.
Let's talk something bitter now.
So that the poison of bitterness
doesn't spread in our friendship.
I have still have not got
the payment for my goods.
The party I have given the
goods to is delaying the payment.
Since he is dangerous, I want to...
When it comes to money,
I am very amoral.
Let alone friends and foes.
I don't hesitate to
kill my own people.
My payment should reach within a week.
Why did you stop the car?
Look in front.
Move aside.
Looking at her eyes I feel...
The Goddess Kali resides in her!
If she confidently says her sons
are coming, they must be en route...
- Accountant!
- I am...
Brother-in-law, finish the
story of this old hag today!
Brother-in-law her words
pierce like a needle!
Crush her.
What are you saying?
She is already dead.
Warriors do not assault women!
- I say crush the old hag!
- No.
No! What are you doing?
Why do you get involved with them?
They terrorize the whole village.
Why do you want to kill yourself?
If I had to die,
I would have died long ago.
But death can't destroy me
till I have destroyed them.
My sons will come to destroy them.
The weapons of a mother.
Karan and Arjun will come.
Mother!
Mother.
Run! Arjun run!
What's going on?
People suffer from sleep walking.
Do you talk in your sleep?
Can you see me? My heart is
beating like a neck slit chicken!
These bones are knocking about
like the coins of a carom board!
Whom do you talk to in your sleep?
I don't know.
But I could see strange shadows
right from my childhood.
I feel as if I have
some relation to them.
I have some deep bond with them.
Something drags me to itself.
Calls out to me.
And what happened today...
...has never happened before.
What happened?
There is a village.
Bells in a temple.
A path...
And I saw myself.
I am running and somebody screams...
Run Arjun run!
Run Arjun run!
Ajay, your father vomited blood.
The doctor said, he is very serious.
Liquor has destroyed his liver.
We will have to operate him.
- How much money will be needed?
- 10,000.
Fine, you operate him.
- What? You'll lose this fight?
- Yes.
Because today I have
to win against death.
It's a matter of my Dad's life.
I need 10000 bucks.
Another shower of cash!
Cash? How partner?
He is the favorite.
People will bet for him.
But we'll win because he'll lose.
And we won't have to pay anyone!
But will you really lose?
10000.
Is there anyone else?
There is! The local
favorite, Ajay.
Isn't the one who got thrashed
the same whose picture you showed me?
But I don't understand
how the tide has turned.
What are you doing?
We will be ruined!
What are you doing?
Stop it. What are you doing?
You needed 10000 bucks!
You said you'd lose the fight!
But you've ruined us by winning it!
What's wrong with you?
I wanted to lose the fight.
I don't know what happened to me.
A life time remains
for you to know who I am.
But at this moment your father
only has a couple of moments.
And this is my card.
- Who are you?
- My name is Ajay.
- Is Mr. Saxena at home?
- Yes, sit. I'll call him.
- Who is it?
- My name is Ajay.
But there is no one named,
Ajay in Mr. Saxon's home.
I'm a guest.
Gentleman, all of us are
guests in this world.
Nevertheless, my telephone
line got linked with yours.
In the course of talking,
our hearts too may be linked.
And we could become friends.
So, are we friends?
I am not interested.
Sir, you appear a strict man.
I have just lit my
father's funeral pyre.
Please call Sonia.
I am Vijay speaking.
Excuse me... there
is a call for Sonia.
Tell him that Sonia has left.
She has left.
Sonia dear, hurry up!
We have to go to the
airport to receive Suraj.
- She just left.
- You?
How is your father?
Here are your 8000 bucks.
I spent 2000 to cremate him.
I'll pay back soon.
I like your sense of self-respect.
Will you work for me?
Your strength, your obsession,
the fire smoldering in your eyes.
I like them. Will you work?
I would have refused another
but I am indebted to you.
- I'll begin tomorrow.
- Not tomorrow, right now.
We have to go to the airport.
- How was the trip?
- Fantastic.
- Where's Sonia?
- She's anxiously waiting at home.
My white Mercedes is outside.
You go ahead. I'll clear
the customs and come.
Is this Mr. Saxena's car?
Keep this briefcase in the car.
Didn't you hear what I said?
Keep this briefcase in the car!
I am not your father's servant!
You dare take the name of Suraj
Singh's father, Durjan Singh?
Keep your right hand in your pocket.
Or you will have to eat
with your left hand forever.
I think both of you have
introduced yourselves.
He is Ajay, a superb fighter.
And he is Suraj Singh,
Sonia's fiancÈe.
Since I came here
that's all I hear.
Sonia is on her way.
She'll soon be here.
It's turned to evening from morning
and there's no sign of Sonia...
Here comes Sonia!
And you neither came to
the airport nor were you at home!
I want to tell you so much!
And listen to so much!
Will you first listen to me
or tell me about yourself?
Now what do I listen to you
and what do I tell you?
- Why? - If you listen to
me, you will forget yourself.
And if you'll forget yourself
what will you remember about me?
And if you won't remember,
what's the use in telling you?
And what's the point in doing
something that's of no use?
Am I right? Bye.
What did she say?
Uncle did you understand?
Son, I'm not so stupid.
Did you see? This gun can tear
apart a 3-inch steel sheet.
It can shatter a bullet
proof glass into pieces.
Like, people select pearls
in the deep waters...
...I too have selected
this deadly gun from abroad.
A month later, these guns will
be delivered at the borders.
As usual, these guns will
reach me through Durjan Singh.
And I will give them to you.
Place your order for
any number of guns.
Uncle, I think, one of our
customers has not come.
- Has he rebelled?
- No.
No. He has become dishonest.
He did not pay me for
the goods bought last time.
And whenever I sent any of my
men to collect the money...
They did not return alive.
That means he swallowed our money?
Such a man is not born!
I have created a man of
steel to get even with him.
Peter, talk to your
men over the telephone.
Ask them to make my payment.
Or to take away your corpse!
What is the matter? You are
trying to look very dashing today.
Take this. All my debts are cleared.
All right, Sir.
You are repaying everybody's debts.
- When will you repay mine?
- What have I taken from you?
You have taken, what nobody
could ever take from me.
You didn't understand?
You have taken this girl's heart.
What? You, a girl?
Look in the mirror. You don't
look like a girl from any angle.
Am I not...
What's the matter?
Nothing. It felt...
I felt as if these bangles...
I can only buy you glass bangles.
Not golden ones.
What's wrong with you today?
- What are you saying?
- Yes.
I did fall in love with you.
But I never thought that
you are a princess.
And I'm the dust of the roads.
- Will I be able to give you all...
- You mean wealth is everything?
No. Money helps man
buy expensive things.
But not a heart.
Man can buy food with money.
But not hunger.
Man can buy a body with
money but not true love!
Love is the greatest
wealth of this universe.
Which you and I have got.
Your love and affection.
They are the treasures of my life.
I'll never let them be away from me.
I want to see you in palaces.
And you've decided to make a
horse groom your life partner!
Not just make him my life partner
but promised to live and die together!
Your anger and cruelty
cannot change our minds.
I'll change his life!
I'll destroy him!
I can do anything!
Can you carry your daughter's
pyre on your shoulders?
You are blind in his love.
I'll show you when the time comes!
I'll shoot you if you
come out of the room tonight!
You lead a peaceful life.
You are very fortunate.
You have no tension about food.
I massage you; I serve you.
Who serves me? Nobody.
In the next life,
I will be born as a horse...
...and you as Lingayya.
Why are you laughing?
Hey! Why are you talking to horses?
Do you have time to talk to me?
You are busy diving in the
swimming pool of love!
The sea of love is very deep.
If you drown...
Hey! Drowning is what
they call love, right?
You have really become a
lovesick Romeo in a week.
The thrill isn't the same
when you stake your life riding...
...as is the thrill when you
stake your heart in love.
If you do not listen to me,
then your life will be at stake.
For I have brought your
death in my hand!
A tiger's death in a mosquito's hand?
Who is this impediment
in the path of love?
I am Durjan Singh's son
and Sonia's fiancÈe.
My name is Suraj Singh.
Sir...!
Burn the place!
Take him away and go! Hurry!
Love got burnt!
Lover got burnt!
Very good, son!
To remove obstacles on the
way and to destroy enemies...
...is this family's tradition.
So I have abided by the
family's tradition.
Fool! Jokes apart. Prepare
for your engagement to Sonia.
We are coming there.
Today is the happiest
day of my life.
Because today I announce
the engagement of my only...
...daughter, Sonia to
Durjan Singh's son Suraj.
Soon as he arrives,
the custom of engagement will...
There he comes.
Stop!
You burnt my Dad's stable!
I'll burn your fingers!
- Call the police.
- No!
Let go of me!
Run! Arjun run!
Run! Arjun run!
I tell you to run!
Arrest him!
We are Thakurs by birth.
Pride and anger courses through
our veins along with blood.
Whenever our women step in
the quicksand of disrepute...
We have them buried alive
in the walls of our homes!
But the love of my son holds me back.
I have always fulfilled
every dream of my son.
And today I will fulfill this dream.
You will marry my son in my house!
Prepare to leave.
I don't understand anything.
All of a sudden why did
our hands stop fighting?
And then why did he tell me this?
Run Arjun! And why did I obey him?
What did he say?
Repeat it again.
Run Arjun! Run!
Something is terribly wrong!
This is the same phrase
you uttered in your sleep!
That's what I am thinking.
The words I kept saying in my sleep...
I kept murmuring.
The same words. The same name.
How did they come on my lips?
Who is this Arjun?
Who are you?
That's what I want to ask you.
- Why does it feel as if...
- We know each other?
We have some deep bond.
There's a chord that
draws us close to each other.
We have met before.
No. I don't even know your name.
Then in the party why did you say...?
Run Arjun! Run!
I too am worried. I can't understand.
How did these words come to my lips?
Who forced me to say it?
I don't know any Arjun.
Neither do I.
But it feels as if we have some
strange relation to this name.
Some old association.
Anyway my name is Vijay.
Thanks for saving my life.
God forbid but if you
ever face such a situation...
I will repay this debt.
Letter from Sonia for you!
Something appears fishy!
Her servant gave it.
What is it son?
They are forcibly taking my
Sonia to Durjan Singh's mansion.
She has asked me to rescue her.
She writes if I don't reach there...
She will consume potion and kill
herself but won't marry Suraj.
What are you thinking of?
Prepare to leave.
If I go, what happens to your stable?
- Your business...?
- Business goes on.
But once lost how will life return?
She is your love. Go my son.
God be with you.
That rascal has given you
these bangles, right?
Throw them away.
- Throw them away, dear.
- No! This is my Vijay's memento.
Not a memento!
This a forgotten story now!
- No!
- Remove them, dear.
