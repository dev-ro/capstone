     WAS ROSCO BIGGER,          
     BUT EVERYBODY              
     CALLED HIM FANG.           
        HIYA, DAVY.             
THOUGHT YOU WERE PRETTY         
FUNNY THIS MORNING,             
DIDN'T YOU?                     
            W-WHAT DO YOU MEAN? 
THE SPELLING BEE.               
MISS FITZSIMMONS                
LET YOU PICK THE WORDS,         
AND YOU                         
GAVE ME U.S.S.R.,               
AND EVERYBODY LAUGHED           
WHEN I GOT IT WRONG.            
            HEY, I MAKE THE SAME
            MISTAKE MYSELF.     
            IS IT TWO Ss OR ONE?
    GRR!                        
        YOU'RE UPSET.           
        I CAN SEE THAT,         
        BUT DELAY MY BEATING    
        UNTIL THURSDAY.         
        I'VE GOT CLASS PICTURES 
        TOMORROW.               
        MY MOM WILL KILL ME     
        IF I'M SCUFFED UP AGAIN.

            CHEESE.             
     I GREW UP IN HASTINGS,     
         MINNESOTA,             
     A SMALL RIVER TOWN         
     ON THE MISSISSIPPI.        
     MY FRIENDS WERE MORE       
     THAN JUST BUDDIES.         
     WE WERE A BAND OF VICTIMS  
     WHO WATCHED                
     EACH OTHER'S BACK.         
     ULF WAS AN ODD KID,        
     PRIMARILY CONCERNED        
     WITH EXPLOSIONS            
     AND SETTING THINGS ON FIRE.
                    COOL.       
 GERRY'S FATHER OWNED A BUTCHER 
     SHOP ON MAIN STREET.       
                    [WHISTLING] 
     TO HIS FAMILY, VEGETARIAN  
     WAS A FOUR-LETTER WORD.    
HEY, GUYS,                      
HOW'S IT GOING?                 
     ONE DAY IN CLASS,          
     GERRY WAS ASKED            
     HOW MANY DIFFERENT         
     FOOD GROUPS THERE WERE.    
     HIS ANSWER WAS TWO--       
     MEAT AND EVERYTHING ELSE.  
     ALAN WAS THE ONLY BLACK KID
         THAT WE'D EVER SEEN.   
     BUT ANY RACIAL DIFFERENCES 
         WERE SOON DISMISSED    
     WHEN HE PROVED HE COULD    
     SHOVE HIS WHOLE FIST       
     INTO HIS MOUTH.            
         IT WAS SOMETHING       
     EVEN GERRY COULDN'T DO.    
            [GERRY]             
            HEY, DAVY,          
            LOOK WHO'S COMING.  
     VICTORIA WAS BY FAR        
     THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL    
     IN THE SCHOOL.             
     SHE MAY HAVE BEEN 10,      
     BUT SHE WAS BUILT          
     LIKE A 12-YEAR-OLD.        
                HI, VICTORIA.   
HI, VICTORIA.                   
        HI, BOYS.               
            WOW.        WOW.    
        DID YOU SEE THAT?       
SEE WHAT?                       
                    THE WAY SHE 
                    WAS LOOKING 
                    AT YOU.     
            YEAH. SHE WANTS IT. 
WANTS WHAT?                     
HEY, DID YOU HEAR?              
        HEAR WHAT?              
THE MOON ROCK'S                 
COMING.                         
        WHAT?                   
        HERE?                   
YEP. NEXT WEEK.                 
THEY'RE SENDING                 
GUARDS AND STUFF.               
IF YOU TRY AND TOUCH IT--       
BANG! THEY'LL                   
SHOOT YOU ON SIGHT.             
                AW, BULLSHIT.   
    WHOA.                       
     DEATH ROCK BY DAVID LEARY. 
        CHAPTER 1.              
    EVERYONE IN TOWN HAD COME   
        TO SEE THE ROCK         
    TILL THERE WAS ONLY         
    ONE OLD MAN LEFT.           
    THE OLD MAN LIMPED UP       
    TO THE MOON ROCK            
    'CAUSE HE HAD A CANE        
        OR SOMETHING.           
        HE REACHED OUT          
    TO TOUCH THE ROCK WHEN...   
            FREEZE!             
FREEZE!                 FREEZE! 
        "DON'T TOUCH            
        THAT MOON ROCK."        
    BUT THE OLD MAN             
    WAS DEAF OR SOMETHING."     
                I'M DEAF        
                OR SOMETHING.   
    AND SO HE REACHED OUT       
    WITH HIS WRINKLED HAND      
            AND...              
    BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!        
YOU'D BETTER                    
BE SLEEPING!                    
            I AM.               
     I KNEW THAT ONE DAY        
     I WOULD LEAVE THIS PLACE,  
         AND I WOULD            
     BECOME A REAL WRITER.      
     I MUST HAVE                
     HAD HUNDREDS OF TOYS       
     THROUGHOUT MY CHILDHOOD,   
     BUT ONE WAS SPECIAL        
     ABOVE ALL THE OTHERS.      
     I'D SAVE MY ALLOWANCE      
     FOR THREE MONTHS           
     TO BUY THE EVEL KNIEVEL    
         ACTION FIGURE.         
     IT WAS AN ADDITIONAL       
         FOUR MONTHS            
         BEFORE I COULD         
     AFFORD THE SUPERCYCLE,     
     BUT IT WAS WORTH IT.       
     EVEL WAS DARING,           
     COOL, FEARLESS.            
     IN SHORT, HE WAS EVERYTHING
         THAT I WASN'T.         
        EVEL KNIEVEL'S A PUSSY. 
ONE DAY YOU'LL BE SORRY         
YOU EVER DID THAT.              
            FUNNY, I            
            DON'T FEEL SORRY.   
WELL, ONE DAY YOU WILL.         
                    CHICKEN.    
PORK ROAST!                     
     WHEN YOU'RE A MARKED MAN,  
     YOU APPRECIATE THE VALUE   
     OF A GOOD HIDING PLACE,    
     AND SO I SPENT THE BETTER  
     PART OF MY CHILDHOOD       
     SITTING IN THE CAVE        
     AT VERMILLION FALLS.       
     THERE WERE STORIES         
     ABOUT THE CAVE             
     THAT ALL THE KIDS KNEW,    
     STORIES ABOUT SOME KID,    
     USUALLY A FRIEND'S         
     COUSIN'S NEIGHBOR,         
     WHO WENT PAST THE RED ROCK 
         AND NEVER RETURNED.    
             I FIGURED THEY     
     WERE PROBABLY JUST STORIES,
         BUT WHY RISK IT?       
    A-T-                        
    O-M-

        IN CELLOPHANE           
        AND DROVE               
        TO THE HOSPITAL,        
        BUT THERE WAS A LINE.   
        I WENT TO               
        THE HARDWARE STORE      
        FOR NEEDLE AND THREAD   
        AND STITCHED IT UP

        BUT YOU CAN STILL DO    
        A FEW THINGS WITH IT.

USED TO BULLY ME AROUND?        
            OH, MAN,            
            HE NAILED YOU!      
            I'VE BEEN DOWN      
            THAT ROAD MYSELF.   
        EVERYBODY'S             
        BEEN PICKED ON.         
        IT'S PART               
        OF GROWING UP.          
YEAH. THAT WAS                  
A LONG TIME AGO.                
BESIDES, WE'VE ALL              
GROWN UP SINCE THEN.            
            FANG CHANGED AFTER  
            THEY SENT HIM AWAY. 
            I FORGET            
            WHAT HE WAS LIKE.   
    THEY SENT HIM AWAY?         
REFORM SCHOOL.                  
                REMEMBER        
                THE MOON ROCK?  
REMEMBER THE MOON               
ROCK WAS STOLEN?                
                FANG STOLE IT.  
                THEY SENT HIM   
                TO REFORM SCHOOL
                FOR THREE YEARS.
WHEN HE CAME BACK,              
HE WAS A DIFFERENT PERSON.      
        REFORM SCHOOL'S         
        ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING,  
        "PRISON FOR KIDS."      
            AND THE ROCHESTER   
            REFORMATORY         
            WAS THE WORST       
            OF THE BUNCH.       
THEY SHUT THAT DOWN.            
    [ALAN]                      
    THEY HAD TO AFTER           
    THAT 60 MINUTES STORY.      
    WHAT DID THEY CALL IT?      
                PEE-WEE PRISON. 
    WHEN HE GOT OUT,            
    THINGS NORMALIZED, RIGHT?   
    HIS PARENTS MUST HAVE--     
SKIPPED TOWN.                   
JUST PICKED UP AND LEFT.        
    THEN THEY SENT HIM          
    TO AN ORPHANAGE.            
    AT LEAST THAT'S             
    WHAT WE KNOW.               
                NOBODY KNOWS    
                WHAT HAPPENED   
                AFTER THAT      
                'CAUSE HE NEVER 
                TALKED ABOUT IT 
                TO ANYBODY.     
                KIDS ARE CRUEL, 
                BUT NOBODY,     
                NOBODY DESERVED 
                WHAT FANG GOT.  
            GOD, IT'S GOOD      
            TO SEE YOU.

YOU WOULDN'T                    
UNDERSTAND IT.                  
                    MR. LEARY?  
                    DAVY.       
                        HI.     
    HIYA.

UH, IT'S HOT DISH.              
                WHAT'S HOT DISH?
WELL, A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO      
WE HAD LASAGNA,                 
AND THEN IT TURNS               
INTO SPAGHETTI.                 
WHEN IT'S FINALLY               
UNRECOGNIZABLE,                 
THEY TURN IT INTO...            
HOT DISH.                       
            DID YOU SEE THAT?   
    WHAT?                       
            THAT GUY            
            FLICKED A PEA AT ME.
    WHO?

                        THERE!  
    WHAT?                       
                HE DID IT AGAIN.
ARE YOU ON MEDICATION           
OR SOMETHING?                   
            THE GUY'S FLICKING  
            PEAS AT ME.         
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.             
        WOULD I MAKE THIS UP?   
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?              
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.          
YOU'RE MAKING ME                
VERY NERVOUS.                   
        SEE IF HE DOES IT AGAIN.
HOW DO YOU KNOW                 
IT'S EVEN HIM?                  
IT COULD BE                     
A CONSPIRACY.                   
MAYBE THERE'S                   
A SECOND GUNMAN.                
                    VERY FUNNY.

HAPPENS AT NIGHT.               
            YOU THINK IT'S SAFE?
DAD, I DON'T THINK              
THERE'S TOO MANY                
DRIVE-BYS IN MAYBERRY.

        OF COURSE I'M O.K.      
        I DON'T FEEL            
        LIKE GOING OUT.         
        YOU DON'T ALWAYS FEEL   
        LIKE GOING OUT, DO YOU? 
    NO.                         
    I JUST WANT TO STAY IN...   
        FOR A WHILE.

HI, CLARK.

ATOMIC WEDGIE?                  
                I'M AFRAID SO.  
    BEN?                        
                        UH-HUH. 
YOU O.K.?                       
                    YEAH.       
I'LL WALK YOU HOME.             
            IS THIS YOUR STREET?
YEAH. IT'S THE BIG ONE          
AT THE END. SEE YA.             
                    HEY, KIRBY. 
    YEAH?                       
        YOU SHOULDN'T LET BEN   
        PICK ON YOU.            
I KNOW. I KNOW.                 
I SHOULD STAND UP               
FOR MYSELF,                     
BE A MAN.                       
                ARE YOU KIDDING?
    IF YOU STOOD UP TO BEN,     
    YOU'D GET CREAMED.          
                THAT'S RIGHT!   
KNOW WHAT I DID                 
WITH MY BULLY?                  
I GAVE HIM AN ALLOWANCE         
TO LEAVE ME ALONE.              
50 CENTS A WEEK.                
            IF THAT DIDN'T WORK,
            I'D THROW HIM OFF   
            THE TRAIL.          
    HOW?                        
            NEVER GO RIGHT BACK 
            TO YOUR LOCKER      
            AFTER CLASS.        
            ZIG-ZAG. IF HE      
            CAN'T FIND YOU,     
            HE CAN'T TOUCH YOU. 
    WHAT ELSE?                  
WELL,                           
THERE'S ALWAYS B.O.             
                    BO--WHAT?   
BODY ODOR.                      
YOU STOP SHOWERING.             
YOU LOSE THE DEODORANT.         
IF THE SMELL GETS               
REALLY, REALLY BAD,             
        NO BULLY IN THE WORLD   
        WILL COME NEAR YOU.     
YOU DIDN'T DATE MUCH            
            WHEN YOU WERE A KID,
            DID YOU?            
            WANT TO COME IN?    
        NO.                     
SEE YA.

POWER TOOL

I'VE BEEN HAVING                
PROBLEMS WITH HIM.              
        WHAT KIND OF PROBLEMS?  
HE'S BEEN PICKING ON ME.

    HOW?                        
                SPECIFICALLY.   
IT'S HARD TO SAY                
EXACTLY.                        
                TRY.            
            START               
            AT THE BEGINNING.   
YEAH, AT THE BEGINNING.         
WELL, HE SHOT PEAS

            BEEN TEACHING HERE

            IF HE'S HAD         
            ANY PROBLEM AT ALL, 
            IT'S BEEN THAT      
            HE'S TOO PASSIVE.   
HE'S CHANGED.                   
I THINK HE'S CHANGED            
BECAUSE OF ME.

            [SCREE]             
            AAH!                
            AAH!                
    AAH!                        
MY FOOT!                        
    DAMN!                       
            WHOA!               
AM I SUPPOSED TO BE SCARED      
OF DRIFTWOOD?                   
HOW COME                        
YOU AIN'T RUNNING?              
            I'VE BEEN RUNNING   
            AWAY FROM YOU       
            MY WHOLE LIFE!      
            I'M THROUGH RUNNING!
AT LEAST                        
YOU HAD A LIFE.                 
YOU RUINED MINE.                
        YOU RUINED MINE FIRST!  
YOU WERE MY FRIEND              
AND YOU BETRAYED ME!            
        YOU THOUGHT ME WERE     
        FRIENDS?                
        YOU BEAT ME UP,         
        YOU HUMILIATED ME.      
        I'M 35 YEARS OLD.       
        I STILL HAVE NIGHTMARES 
        ABOUT FOURTH GRADE!     
        THAT'S NOT WHAT FRIENDS 
        ARE SUPPOSED TO DO      
        FOR EACH OTHER.         
        A FRIEND MAKES YOU FEEL 
        GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF.    
REALLY? THEN YOU'RE             
THE BEST FRIEND                 
I EVER HAD!                     
                    DAVY!       
    OPEN UP, YOU IDIOTS,        
    I'M A MURDERER!             
    ULF.                        
WHAT ARE YOU                    
DOING HERE?                     
                I DID IT.       
            I STOOD UP TO FANG. 
GOOD FOR YOU.                   
            I KILLED HIM.       
YOU REALLY LET HIM              
HAVE IT, HUH?                   
        WE WERE ON TOP          
        OF VERMILLION FALLS.    
        I HIT HIM               
        AND HE WENT OVER.       
        HE'S DEAD!              
GET IN THE TRUCK.               
                I GOT TO CONFESS
                TO THESE GUYS.  
GET IN THE TRUCK.               
        JEEZ, DAVY,             
        WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? 
    I'LL SPEND THE REST         
    OF MY LIFE IN JAIL.         
                STOP TALKING    
                LIKE THAT.      
                LET'S GET       
                OUR HEADS       
                TOGETHER.       
                I'LL DROP YOU   
                AT HOME,        
                AND YOU'RE      
                GOING TO GET    
                SOME SLEEP.     
                I'LL GO BACK    
                TO OLD MILL PARK
                AND LOOK        
                FOR THE BODY.   
LAY LOW UNTIL I CALL YOU.       
DON'T DRAW ANY ATTENTION        
TO YOURSELF.                    
I'LL TAKE CARE                  
OF THE EVIDENCE.                
            EVENING, NEIGHBOR.  
    AAH!                        
DON'T YOU SLEEP, ART?           
        MIDNIGHT IS ACTUALLY    
        THE BEST TIME           
        FOR LAWN CARE.          
        SEE, THE SUNSHINE       
        CAUSES THE GRASS        
        AND SHRUBBERY           
        TO BEND IN A WAY        
        THAT MAKES LAWN CARE,   
        MOWING AND PRUNING--    
    ART.                        
            WHAT'S WRONG, DAVID?
I'VE DONE SOMETHING             
REALLY TERRIBLE.                
            YOU KILLED          
            THE SHOP TEACHER.   
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?           
            WELL, IT'S JUST--   
            IT'S JUST LOGICAL.  
            EVERYBODY           
            IN TOWN KNOWS       
            THAT YOU TWO        
            HAD A TWISTED       
            RELATIONSHIP.       
THEY DO?                        
            IT'S A SMALL TOWN,  
            DAVID.              
            PEOPLE TALK.        
YOU DON'T THINK                 
I'M A MURDERER,                 
DO YOU?                         
            OH, WELL, DAVID,    
            NOW THAT'S HARD     
            FOR ME TO SAY.      
            THE ONLY PERSON     
            WHO CAN SAY         
            IF YOU'RE A MURDERER
            OR NOT IS YOU.      
            SEE,                
            YOUR PERCEPTIONS    
            OF TONIGHT'S EVENTS 
            CREATES YOUR OWN    
            INDIVIDUAL REALITY. 
            IN THE END,         
            IT JUST--           
            IT'S ABOUT          
            SEMANTICS, ISN'T IT?
        I REMEMBER              
        THE FIRST TIME          
        I TRIED TO KILL BETTY.  
    WHAT?                       
            OH, LET ME FINISH.  
YOU TRIED TO KILL BETTY.        
                LET ME FINISH.  
                OH, I SEE.      
            I SEE,              
            MR. HIGH AND MIGHTY.
            HEY, I DIDN'T KILL  
            THE SHOP TEACHER.   
            WHO KILLED          
            THE SHOP TEACHER?   
    SHH, SHH.                   
            YOU KILLED          
            THE SHOP TEACHER.   
            YOU KILLED HIM.     
                DAD.            
            WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
    OUT.                        
            WHAT HAPPENED       
            TO YOU?             
                HI, MR. LEARY.  
    AAH!

        IF KIRBY SLEEPS OVER?   
HAVE YOU SEEN                   
MY DAD AROUND?                  
        GOOD NIGHT.             
                GOOD NIGHT.     
         NOTHING I AM DOING     
         IS WRONG.              
         THERE'S NOTHING WRONG. 
 [FANG]                         
 YOU'RE THE BEST FRIEND         
 I EVER HAD--                   
 BEST FRIEND I EVER HAD--       
 FRIEND I EVER HAD--EVER HAD.   
        YOU'RE ALIVE.           
YOU'RE DEAD.                    
WOW. YOU GOT

STYLE MY HAIR?                  
LISTEN, CAN I

                    YAAAAAH!    
                DAD.            
    WHAT?                       
            YOU BOYS ARE HAVING 
            A SLEEP OVER?       
            IS THAT O.K.?       
        YEAH.                   
ME AND BEN                      
MADE UP.                        
CAN'T YOU GUYS                  
DO THE SAME?                    
COME ON, BEN.                   
CONNIE IS ON.                   
                    COOL.       
CAN I ASK YOU                   
SOMETHING?                      
WHY DID YOU STEAL               
THE MOON ROCK?                  
                YOU'LL LAUGH.   
NO, I WON'T.                    
        I STOLE THE MOON ROCK   
            BECAUSE I WANTED    
            TO BE AN ASTRONAUT. 
            I'M SO STUPID.      
            A GUY LIKE ME COULD 
            NEVER BE SOMETHING  
            GREAT LIKE THAT.    
YOU DID ALL RIGHT.              
            OH, YEAH, I DID     
            GREAT, DIDN'T I?    
NO. I'M SERIOUS.                
YOU GOT A--YOU GOT              
A TERRIFIC KID OUT THERE.       
                THAT I DO.      
    HEY.                        
                    YEAH?       
    YOU CHIPPED                 
    YOUR TOOTH.                 
            FANG'S GONE.        
     I BELIEVE THAT ALL THINGS  
         HAPPEN FOR A REASON.   
     IN A WAY, MEETING BACK UP  
         WITH MY BULLY          
     WAS THE BEST THING THAT    
     COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ME. 
HEY, DAD.                       
     I'D CLOSED A CHAPTER       
         IN MY LIFE,            
     AND WITH THE SEMESTER      
     COMING TO AN END,          
     IT WAS TIME TO MOVE ON.    
                WELL, IT'S      
                THE LAST ONE.   
ARE YOU O.K.?                   
                YEAH, YEAH,     
                I'M FINE.       
    WOW.                        
WOULD YOU RETURN THIS           
FOR ME?                         
I'LL REIMBURSE YOU              
FOR THE LATE CHARGES.           
        I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL.   
        YOU CAN PAY ME BACK     
        WHEN I COME TO NEW YORK.
I'LL CALL YOU                   
AS SOON AS I GET THERE.         
                YOU BETTER.
