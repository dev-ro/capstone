"This story is entirely true...
...since I entirely imagined it".
OK.
Personalities from all over the world
have met today...
...to wait restlessly...
...for the arrival of the president Marc Jary.
The president will be welcomed
by the enthusiastic crowd...
...and will arrive at the
ceremony in the presidential car...
on Victory boulevard.
-President Jary will serve
for another 6 years...
...as the chief of state,
according to the people's wish.
-He was elected for the second time
...and has been transformed into the most important
figure in the country...
...while enjoying wide international support...
...and winning the elections
by a margin of over 300,000 votes
-Briefly, please, Mr. President, which political line
you will adopt for the next years?
-Bernard Shaw said...
"There are people that are seeing
the things as they are...
...and are wondering "why?"...
...and there are people that are dreaming
at things as they never were...
...and they are wondering "why not?"
-I will try to be among
the last ones.
-Up there, on the terrace!
I saw him shooting!
-To all the crews!
-Building 244B! 244B!
-The sniper is there!
Block all the exits!
Press communicate.
By presidential decree,
an inquiry committee...
...was designated to establish
a detailed report...
...about the circumstances that led
to the death of the president Marc Jary.
-The committee is directed by...
Frederick Heiniger,
President of the Supreme Court...
...and composed by Mr. Hugues Adler...
...the Secret Services Director...
...Mr. Robert Picart, Secretary of Justice...
...Mr. Albert Philippe, senator...
...General Anthony Baryn,
the Secretary of Defense...
...and Mr. Henri Volney,
General Attorney.
The inquiry, lasting over an year,
is close to its end.
20.000 testimonies, 30 annexed volumes...
...evidence, 682 pages, this is the report
that will be handed to the chief of state...
...and that will be soon published.
The report conclusions are:
President Jary was killed
by 3 bullets...
...shot from a semiautomatic rifle
Winchester Magnum, calibre 338.
The killer name is Karl Eric Daslow...
...and the murder was premeditated.
Daslow was a neuropath,
an unstable character and a loner.
Daslow acted single.
No complicity was proved...
...nor conspiracy.
During the arrest Daslow committed suicide.
Signed: Heiniger committee.
-Thank you, Mrs. Lapierre.
-Do you agree with these conclusions, gentlemen?
-Perfectly agreed.
-Then we will all sign this document.
-I'm very sorry, gentlemen...
...but I cannot sign this report.
-Camera 2, focus on Volney!
-Attention please, 20 seconds!
-The photographers are invited...
...to occupy the designated places!
-Attention please, 5 seconds!
-Good evening. Today at 4:00 pm
all the telexes of the world...
...were receiving the most astonishing
and unexpected information:
A member of the Heiniger committee...
...refused to sign the inquiry conclusions...
...over the circumstances
of president Jary's assassination.
That men is Attorney General,
 Henri Volney...
...who is with us tonight in our show
"One man, one event"
-Attorney General, this evening
you are the men that made the event.
-So we will kindly ask you
to answer the questions...
...of the 5 members of the committee
you took part of...
...of the international press representatives...
...and of those who want to participate
in this show...
...calling 7.777.777.
-Mr. Heiniger, you are the president of the
Supreme Court and of the inquiry committee.
-For this reason I will ask you
to start the debate.
I would like to ask Attorney General
 Volney a very simple question:
-For a whole year you have participated
in all the different stages...
...of this elaborate and exhaustive inquiry...
...yet you never once explicitly expressed 
your disagreement.
-Why are you doing it today?
-Mr. President...
-The year that you speak of was the 
year of the inquiry.
-I had no reason
to go against an ongoing inquiry.
-Today I cannot agree
with the conclusions of this inquiry.
-Please! I haven't finished!
-I would like also to ask Mr. Heiniger
a question.
-A very simple one.
-Please.
-Is it true that, along with the inquiry...
...you received a directive from
the highest levels...
...to establish that Daslow
was the only shooter...
...and that there was no conspiracy nor plot?
"I wouldn't take the responsibility
of starting a 3rd World War", you declared then.
-Did you received this directive?
-Yes or no?
-Mr. President of Supreme Court...
-Please allow me to help you.
-You will answer
that nobody received such a directive...
...and that I have no paper
to prove the contrary...
...and all this will turn against me.
-You will also tell me
that I've made up all of these allegations...
...but then I will show the document...
...that proves the contrary...
...and all of this will turn against you.
-President Heiniger,
do you take this chance?
-Yes, I received that directive.
-I mean this suggestion...
...this wish, more exactly.
-But I swear I didn't follow it.
-Thank you.
-So, General Attorney, on one side
we have those that signed the report...
...and the other side, you, a brave man of justice,
alone against all?
-No, Gral. Baryn, no...
-I must state that all the
Heiniger commission members...
...are honest, serious, advised ...
...and of outstanding character...
...conscious of the greatness
of their mission.
-we are flattered, Mr. General Attorney.
-"You are all correct, BUT..."
-But what?
-What are you blaming
this committee of?
-What I am blaming this committee of...
...is a certain state of mind.
-We are all sincere when we say...
..."we want the truth
and nothing but the truth"...
...but we all hope that this truth...
...will be different than
the one we obtained.
-A comfortable truth,
that bothers no one...
...that dispels the rumours.
-A truth that melts the mysteries...
...and keeps our image intact.
-What rumours are you talking about?
What are you afraid of?
-I'm afraid to admit that
in this country...
...certain political problems
can be solved through assassination.
This is unacceptable!
-Mr. President, allow me to recess...
...because of these insults
to the country's honour!
-Sit down, General Baryn!
-The truth has no honour, nor country!
It must be accepted as is.
-Jack Turner, France Press...
-General Attorney,
 you think Daslow is innocent?
-Mr. Turner, do not rush
to conclusions!
-After one year of elaborate inquiries
We've come to the following conclusions.
One: Daslow is the assassin of the
president Jary.
-I respond: It's possible.
-Two: he acted premeditated.
My opinion: possibly.
-Three: Daslow was insane...
-I answer that nothing allows us
to state this...
...because I don't find anything in this report
to prove his dementia.
-Then, did he commit the murder
being insane...
...or we are declaring him insane
because he committed the murder?
-Four: it says that Daslow lacked the family warmth,
that he was emotionally instable...
...and he wanted to take his place
in history with this gesture.
-There are countless like him
all over the world...
...but they don't shoot presidents.
-Five: it says that Daslow acted alone.
-Unfortunately, I can't tell that
for sure.
-Finally, six: Daslow committed suicide.
-And I answer to you - Why not?
-Finally, I have 6 doubts regarding
the 6 allegations above.
-Quiet! Everyone at its time, please!
-It tells me that
all the phone lines are blocked.
-I suggest you to listen
a viewer's question.
-Mr? Mrs?
-Like thousands other citizens
of this country...
...I liked president Jary.
-I want to know what will happen now.
-Mr. Heiniger, would you like to answer?
-Mrs, the 4th article of the
 inquiry committee mandate says...
...that if one of the members refuses
to sign the final report...
...the committee is dismissed, and the one
opposing to its conclusions...
...is authorized to start the inquiry
from the very beginning.
-This person, Mrs,
is the General Attorney - Henri Volney.
-Good night, Pierre.
"You were INCREDIBLE!!!!"
-I think he passed the whole night
in the office.
-What makes you say that?
-He wasn't shaved yet
when I arrived.
-Hello, gentlemen.
-Please allow me to say...
...how glad I am that you are beside me.
Thank you.
-That's all?
-These are the only images caught
by the only camera focused...
...on the official convoy, at the
moment of the assault.
-The enthusiastic crowd broke the cable
and the camera was disconnected.
-It took 3-4 min. to restore the connection,
and when was it was restored...
...all was done already.
-The drama took place
over the disconnection interval.
-I see.
-When the camera started again
i recorded a small piece of film.
-If you want to see it...
-Of course.
-At this moment the bar pattern appeared...
...and the assassination was announced.
That's all.
-Max... play again
the last sequences.
-Stop!
-We must find that man.
-If his camera was working, he surely
captured the murder on tape.
-Check all the labs...
...and find his name and address.
-Fine.
So I'm wedged in the office, right?
-That's age's privilege, pal.
-We must publish an announcement
in all the papers.
"We are looking for any amateur movie
of the assassination of president Jary".
"Please send the tapes at this address:
General Att. Henri Volney, P.O. box 405".
"Reward".
-No, "substantial reward".
-No, we don't watch any of the movies,
it's all automatic.
-The tapes enter on one side...
...and on the other side are thousands of km...
...of baptisms, weddings
and holiday memories...
...ready to be sent out.
-Here are the first results
of the published announcement.
-We already got 5 films
since this morning.
-8mm, 8mm wide, 16mm.
4 films without sound and 1 with sound.
-Bob?
-We must continue this. 2.800 labs...
...aren't so much though.
-Here? OK.
-We are watching the great moments
of cinema.
-If you are interested...
...call Mr. Sanio at 8.463.742.
-We have a case with a master of
suspense here.
-He has the business sense too.
-Mr. Sanio?
-Yes, Robert Sanio.
This is Mr. Keller, my attorney.
-Come in, please.
-Take a sit.
-How much, Mr. Sanio?
-After I discussed this with my wife...
...if I give you this film
 it means that I will lose it for good.
-Me and my wife are very attached
to this film.
-How much, Mr. Sanio?
-200?
-2.000.
-That we would like to be put into the account
of the cancer research foundation.
-Your generosity gives you honor.
-Of course, you will also give my client,
let's say... the amount of...
-25.000.
-Mr. Sanio, you are the most expensive
film director of this country.
-Take this to the office 412.
-I would like to add,
because I'm an honest guy...
...that I've already sold the movie
a year ago, right after the event.
-To who?
-I do not recall the company name...
...but I didn't sell it to no one else,
that you can be sure of.
-All right.
-Here. I made a copy.
-Maybe two of them, right?
-It's not the time for filming!
-Get out of here!
-Max, rewind.
I will tell you when to stop.
-Stop. Play.
"-It's not the time for filming!
-Get out of here!"
-Stop!
-Curious... Don't you think?
-The first bullet hits the president
from ahead...
...but few people
are looking in the opposite direction.
-Maybe somebody shouts at them.
-So you're saying that
during the assassination...
...somebody shouts: "Hey, Charly!"...
...and all the people are turning
to see who shouted.
-No, they definitely heard something...
but by no means "Hey, Charly!".
-Max! Go on!
-Here Sanio is hustled,
but he is still filming.
-Now playback again the same part.
-But when I tell you
to slow down...
...play it frame by frame.
-Slow!
-Stop!
-Those from below were looking at him.
There is no doubt.
-Increase the image. We must
find these people.
-It won't be easy.
-Max, Charly, you have a green light.
-We will go to see
the 2nd floor of the building.
-It's a nice office...
...but unoccupied
for over an year, unfortunately.
-The phone isn't working, sir.
You can make a call from the hallway.
-Do you want to rent this office, right?
-No, not exactly.
-Tell me, this office belonged
to a company...
...named Transcontinental
Import-Export?
-Yes. But they just vanished.
-But, since they payed for 8 months
in advance, the owner wasn't so angry.
-But I think I know what happened.
-We are in the building that the 
president was shot from, did you know? No.
-The Transcontinental people were
some stylish guys...
...that wanted to drift away
from this building.
-The best proof is their scuttle.
-What makes you believe
that they were "stylish guys"?
-Before they disappeared they
gave me an envelope...
...with a very beautiful gift inside.
-I'll leave it to your imagination.
-Hold on! Here.
-No, you don't have to...
Thank you!
-I will leave you the key,
you can return it to the janitor.
-I've called the Chamber of Commerce...
-Transcontinental Import-Export
does not exist.
-It's a shadow company.
-As well as this office, that was rented...
...only for hiding
the second sniper.
-And two snipers already means
an organisation...
-So one of the snipers was Daslow,
up on the terrace...
...and the other one here,
on the 2nd floor.
-But the 9 witnesses don't turn their backs
towards the terrace...
...but here, towards the 2nd floor...
...because the shots
were heard from here.
-Strange though, isn't it?
-There is nothing about the 9 witnesses
in the report...
...but instead, a certain Niki Farnese,
who was in the crowd...
...shouted pointing to the window
were Daslow was...
-I quote: "Up there! I saw him shooting!
I saw him!"
-Thank you for coming, Mr. Farnese.
-Your colleagues told me that it will only 
take a few minutes...
-My wife takes care of our shop
in the meantime.
-We will try not to misuse your time.
-The day of the assassination...
...you saw a person shooting...
...from this building's terrace?
-I saw it perfectly.
-Where were you at that moment?
-I came here early that morning.
-I was right here.
-Right beside this red curbstone.
-Are you sure?
-Absolutely!
I was sitting like this, you see?
-A policeman even told me
not to sit on the curbstone.
-It seemed stupid to me
because I was alone.
-So I stayed, and from this place
I saw it all happening.
-Can you give me your glasses, please?
-Thank you.
-Tell me, please,
what are you seeing on that board?
-It's blurry...
I'm short-sighted.
-But that day, when you shouted:
"Up there! I saw him shooting!"...
...that day you were
wearing the glasses?
-Of course, I wear them all the time.
-This photo was made that day.
-It's you there, right?
-Yes it's me.
-Only that you didn't have
the glasses on.
-I didn't have them anymore. The place was crowded...
Someone pushed me...
...and the glasses fell
and they broke.
-I had to buy another pair...
...I can give you a copy
of the invoice, if you want.
-But when I saw the assassin...
...I was still wearing the glasses,
that I'm sure of.
-Now you see the terrace?
-Of course...
-No, no, keep looking it!
-Mr. Farnese, this television vehicle
was exactly in this place.
-So what?
-I only said that I saw
up on the terrace a man with a rifle...
...and when the police came...
...they found someone
with a rifle up there.
-That proves that
I didn't make up anything.
-So?
-Nothing, Mr. Farnese.
-You can go back
to your wife and your commerce.
-I am Pierre Gregory, sir...
...and this is Stan, our sniper.
-You were the one who retrieved
Daslow's rifle and shells?
-Yes, sir. They were like this.
-These 3 marks are indicators
of the shells' position?
-Absolutely, sir.
-One of my colleagues took pictures
of the scene before my arrival.
-I brought them.
-OK.
-Good. Let's start.
-We are ready.
-We blocked everything on a 0,6 miles radius.
It's all ready. Over.
-Gregory, your shells
are not as disciplined...
...as Daslow's ones.
-Again, please.
-How do you explain this mystery?
-3 shells almost perfectly
lined up and grouped.
-I think it's more than a mystery, sir.
It's a true miracle.
-Thank you.
That's all for today.
-Did you find something
about the witnesses?
-We've almost completed the records.
Robert Kosheba, Marianne Delila...
...Charles Polodi, Guillaume Gemenos...
...Nicolás Rosenko, Ramón Jiménez...
...Ursula Hoffmann, Serge Levis...
...and an unknown.
-Well done!
-The truth is that we had
more luck than we deserved.
-Almost all of them came
to testify on their own accord...
...and were heard
by the Heiniger comission.
-I did not read such testimonies
in the Heiniger report... I'm surprised...
-Page 198 of the report...
"The commission discarded
the testimonies...
...that were proved too imaginative,
futile or preconceived".
-This is the reason therefore
you did not read their statements.
-All of them came forward...
...except two of them:
-Nicolás Rosenko, journalist...
...that was working for a tabloid.
-We found this on the first page
of his magazine...
...not as an author,
but as a subject.
-Hello?
-I am speaking
as representative of the PLO.
Palestine Liberation Organization.
-About?
-Listen carefully, I won't repeat:
We will execute your journalist...
...Nicolás Rosenko...
...because he is a propaganda agent
paid by Israel.
-You will find his body in your
underground parking, sector 6.
-One hour later,
PLO was denying its involvement
...in Rosenko's killing.
-The police closed the file.
-That's why Rosenko
did not come in front of the commission.
-I think he did not testify...
...because he preferred
to work on his own.
-He was passionate
about the Daslow case.
-I found this under the backseat
of  his car.
-"Daslow's authopsy was never made.
Why?"
-"Daslow kills himself with a gun.
To whom did the gun belong?"
-"The route of the official
convoy was disclosed...
...only in the last minute.
-How come Daslow knew it?"
-He's right.
-"They already know each other.
Who?"
-Rosenko tore off these pages
because they were very important to him.
-Give me your copy...
-Pages 147 and 148.
-Good...
-Karl together with an
italian friend, Luigi Lacosta.
-Try to find out something
about this Lacosta.
-Let's continue.
-Ursula Hoffmann...
-Recently arrived
from Hamburg's seedy harbors...
...she's the sensuality itself...
...she is the dream and the love...
-In a hallucinating nude show...
...Ursula Hoffmann!"
-Ursula! What are you doing there,
for Christ's sake?
-According the inquiry, it seems...
...we have a sentimental suicide here.
-Ramón Jiménez, 33 years, artist...
-Precise as always,
at 9.00 the garage keeper...
...takes out a client's car.
-In front of the garage
a man offers a light to a pedestrian.
-The pedestrian is Ramón Jiménez.
-Suddenly he seems to
feel badly...
...and he falls on the sidewalk.
-An ambulance stops
and picks up the patient.
-It was 9:05.
-Ramón Jiménez was still alive...
-At 10:30, accordingly to the
medical registry book,
...the ambulance arrives at the hospital...
...bringing to the emergency room
a dead person.
-"Heart attack", 
 the doctors concluded.
-No autopsy was made.
-There are dead people as a result
of a heart attack, aren't they?
-Yes but here we have a delay...
...an enormous delay of
one hour and a quarter.
-Even in the case of a traffic jam,
the trip from that garage...
... to the hospital won't last
more than 15 min.
-15 minutes.
-But the ambulance makes it
in almost one hour and a half.
-How did the ambulance
 crew explain this delay?
-They had no explanation.
-The ambulance belonged
to a small company...
...which was immediately
taken over by a bigger one.
-Of course they "lost" the personnel book
to cover up everything.
Marianne Delila...
Guillaume Gemenos...
Charles Polodi...
...three traffic accidents.
-Marianne Delila
was an exceptional biker...
-A truck hit her without stopping.
-And the other two?
-Almost identical cases,
both Gemenos and Polodi...
...lost control over their vehicles.
-The real accident causes were ignored
in all the 3 cases.
-Serge Levis, 23 years, single...
...was a model...
...you have his file here.
-Gone without a trace just before
he signed a few contracts.
-Found dead 2 months later,
in a motel.
-Robert Kosheba, 28 years,
electronics engineer...
-On 22nd of September. he had a drink
in Manhattan bar...
...when the narcotic brigade alighted
for a routine control.
-"Police! Nobody moves!"
-"Hands up!"
-The policeman that killed Kosheba
claimed self defense.
-And was suspended from duty
some time after.
-Robert Kosheba
did not carry any guns.
-And him?
Died from aphtae fever, I suppose.
-No sir, nobody talked to him.
-He hasn't appeared up til now...
He is staying anonymous.
-We don't know who is this person
or where is it.
-We made some photos
from that tape.
-"I am addressing to this citizen
and to all that know him".
"Please contact immediately
the General Attorney's office".
"Att. Volney, tel. 344.344.33"
"This number is available
night and day".
"I repeat: 344.344.33..."
"Sir, if this photo is yours...
...I urge you to call us
as fast as you can, not only because...
...you were the witness of a
highly important events...
...but mostly because your life...
...and the lives of your beloved ones
are in great danger."
"This was a message from Attorney
Henri Volney"...
..."a message that will be broadcasted
through out this evening".
-Call them, Frank.
You must tell them everything.
-Jeanne! Don't start again!
-Don't you understand that this is
the last mistake I could do?
-It all must be forgotten.
-If you don't call, someone
will identify you finally.
-The kid from the butchery...
...your office colleagues...
-So?
-I didn't note the phone number.
344.344.33
-Yes, I'm listening.
-"It was Robert Mitchum in
Young, Billy, Young".
-"Did I won?"
-No, Mrs, it wasn't him and
we do not offer any prize.
-"This is not a TV contest?"
-No, ma'am.
-Volney's office,
I'm listening.
-"I know the one whose photo
you broadcasted".
-"His name is Frank Bellony."
-"We were good friends".
-Why are you saying "we were"?
-"Because we ran into some problems...
...due to our wives - they
could not stand each other".
-Do you have his address?
-"I think he moved out,
we haven't met lately..."
-Hello?
-I'm Frank Bellony. I would like
to speak to General. Att. Volney.
-I'm his assistant.
Please don't hang up!
-Yes?
-General Att. Volney?
-I'm the one that you are
looking for you.
-I called because
you're wasting your time.
-It's pointless to keep broadcast
my photo on TV.
-I don't have any information
about this case.
-I didn't see or hear anything.
And I don't want to meet you.
-You are right to be afraid, sir...
-It's possible that you don't know this but,
there are 8 more persons like you...
...that saw something suspicious
on the day of the assassination
-Glad to hear that.
So talk to them.
-It would be very difficult, because...
...these 8 people are dead now.
And not from natural causes.
-If you don't trust me...
...you will be the ninth.
Not witness, but body, obviously.
-You are a jerk.
-You must choose between
the jerk and the killer, sir.
-All right... I live in...
-No! Don't tell me your address!
-Is there a pay phone near you?
-Perfect. Call me from there.
-We will trace the call...
...and we will come after you.
-Att. Volney, I'm listening.
-I'm calling from a pay phone.
-"Don't hang up.
We are tracing the call"...
..."and we will come after you.
We will arrive in a white car".
-"Don't hang up and don't
forget to insert coins".
-I see a car...
-It's not as you told me,
it's black... Hello?
-"We traced the phone booth.
We're coming.
-The Bellony's are here, sir.
-I'm coming.
-Good evening, Mr. Bellony.
-Good evening, lady.
-Our assistant will take care of you.
-You can rest
in the next room.
-All but me are?...
-Yes, they're all dead.
-Come with me, please.
-As soon as you have the list
bring it to us .
-Please concentrate
and look at the pictures.
-I have to identify the shooter
in these photos, right?
-Exactly.
-All those who will appear
were chosen considering their past.
-Are you comfortable?
-Max, please.
-No, it's not him,
he was way younger.
-No, it wasn't blond,
that's for sure.
-Good evening, Mr. De Palma.
-We are alone?
-I was told this here...
you must make a reservation
24 hours in advance.
-Mr. Lacosta, it's 3 AM...
...and this restaurant remained open
especially for us.
-I don't think we can complain
about the discretion here.
-Sit down please.
A bit of vodka?
-Which one you prefer?
-Polish, lemon, Russian?
-Your choice.
-Let be Russian, then.
-Did you watch Volney's
broadcasted appeal?
-Yes, by chance.
-The appeal wasn't broadcasted
anymore since 9 PM...
...probably because Volney
found what he looked for.
-This ninth witness
that you let escape.
-Caucazian shashlyk.
-Mr. De Palma, I accomplished
my part of the contract...
-We are very pleased with you
Mr. Lacosta.
-Perfect.
Our contract stipulated though...
...two commitments from you.
-The first one: the salary.
Accomplished.
-The second one: my safety
and my return to my country.
-For your safety we eliminated...
...8 inconvenient witnesses.
-But do you think it's the time
to go back in your country?
-A few hours from now it will be
maybe too late, Mr. De Palma.
-Right at this moment
there is a man in this city...
...a man who saw me...
...and who will talk.
-No... At least the one I saw
at the 2nd floor...
...does not seems like
anyone in these photos.
-I'm sorry, but...
I can't lie to you.
-We appreciate it.
-Anyway, I would like to see again
one of those photos.
-Sure.
-It's among the last five ones.
-Before this one, I guess.
-No, it's not him.
-This one! It's him!
-This is the guy
from the second floor?
-No, this is the man with the umbrella.
Now I'm sure, it's him.
-He was 1 yard behind me,
down in the crowd.
-I was with the other ones,
on the catwalk.
-I didn't notice him
in the first place...
...but he opened his umbrella
a blink of an eye...
...before the shootings.
-With all that sun then,
I assumed he is crazy.
-Excuse me, I don't think this has
something to do with your case...
...but it was strange to see him
among those in the photos.
-I'm sorry.
-No problem, thank you, Mr. Bellony.
-For your safety and
your family's...
...you must take
a forced vacation.
-I took care of everything.
-Here you have the travel cheques.
-This young man will escort you
to a private jet.
-It looks like you'll have
 very good weather in the Caribbean.
-I will take you back
to your family now.
-General Att., what have I done
to deserve all this?
-Nothing, Mr. Bellony.
You just watched something...
...that you weren't supposed to.
-Have a good trip!
-De Palma, Carlos.
Originally from Honduras.
-Refugee for political reasons
at age 23.
...suspected for a long time
to be one of the...
...leaders of a
criminal organization.
-Each time that he was indicted
he claimed he was discriminated ...
...and won. Sentenced for
5 years for financial fraud...
...he was released in less than 2 years.
-Put his phone under surveillance.
-You don't want to arrest him?
-No. Under what circumstances?
-For wearing an umbrella?
-If I'll be exposed
due to this witness...
...you will be exposed too.
-This means you will talk?
-I have certain dreams...
...and now I also got the money...
...as well as the age
to make them come true.
-You're right.
We must respect our dreams.
-They separate us from
reality's commonplaces...
...and send us to that invisible world...
...where we can
make our wishes come true.
-No, no, I'm waiting.
-An extremely rainy day?
-No, I'm not interested
in the wind direction.
-No clear sky?
Thank you very much.
-It's something I don't get.
-Daslow goes up the terrace with a rifle
to shoot the president...
...but now we know
that the rifle was not loaded.
-Why would one go up
with an unloaded rifle?
-Someone replaced it
in the last minute.
-The picture is taken
in front of his own house...
...having the rifle in his hand...
...on 28th March 1977.
-I called the local weather agency.
-On 28th March 1977
it was heavily raining...
...but in this photo it's sunshine.
-Maybe it was taken before,
or after the rain stopped...
-Before or after the rain...
-Hydrangeas do not bloom in March...
...but only at the end of July, Charly.
-It's a fake photo.
-They "put" Daslow's head on it.
It's obvious.
-So we have a fake image
of Daslow?
-Everything is fake in this case, EVERYTHING!
-A fake witness, a fake sniper,
fake shells...
...fake hydrangeas
and a fake report!
-With fake conclusions.
-682 pages of conclusions...
...that do not contain even the slightest answer
to the most elementary question:
-WHY? Why was Daslow on that terrace
although he had no reason too?
-The psychiatric report
specifies a case of paranoia.
-Of course! If we didn't find a reason...
...we concluded he's insane!
-Only that insane people
find reasons on their own:
...either God lead them...
...or they had to save the world
from a catastrophe...
...and they are telling that to themselves.
These psychoses can be detected.
-But about Daslow we don't have a thing,
absolutely nothing.
-Neither from school,
nor from the army...
...neither from his employers,
nor from his daily life.
-We can't get any trace
of psychical illness.
-Nevertheless, on May 22nd...
...at 13:01 he shoots
the president...
...and at 13:02 he commits suicide.
-Well, no, gentlemen!
An insane assassin never kills himself!
-He wants to show everybody
his vision!
-There are statistics about this.
-The psychiatric report is based
on a scientific experiment...
...directed by professor David Naggara
from Laye University .
-Perfect! Let's call him!
-It's 4 AM, sir...
-What day are we?
-Sunday morning, sir.
-Oh, well... Go to sleep.
I'll see you Monday morning.
"The undersigned psychological experts...
...not using the examination
due to subject's absence...
...have elaborated in this report...
...on basis of K.E. Daslow's past.
-His inclination to violence...
...which lead him to this
cruel and irresponsible gesture...
...can be explained through
what we call...
...paranoid dementia".
-Prof. Naggara,
do you remember this man?
-Yes, unfortunately he's famous...
-It is Daslow, right?
-Yes.
-He participated
in one of our experiments.
-Did you read the psychiatric conclusions
of Heiniger's report?
-I must admit I didn't.
-Professor, during the tests
you run here...
...could you diagnose a man
with a mental disease?
-In your opinion Daslow
was acting like a paranoid?
-Excuse me.
-I'll be back.
-A paranoid?
-I propose for you see
one of our experiments.
-The behaviour of today's subject
might help you understand...
...Daslow better.
-Very well!
-Have a sit.
-Through this special glass
you can see without being seen.
-You have a volume meter to hear
what they discuss down there.
-I'll be right back.
-Will it take long?
-About an hour, I was told.
-What are we going to do?
-We will explain right away.
-Here is prof. Naggara.
-Mr. Rivoli?
-No... Despaul.
-Then you must be Mr. Rivoli, right?
-Yes, professor.
-Gentlemen, a few words about the experiment
that we will conduct here today...
-A psychological theory says...
...that an individual learns
more correctly and efficiently...
...if he's conscious that every mistake
will attract a punishment .
-An example of this theory
in everyday life would be...
...the punishment that parents
enforce over their children...
...when they are making mistakes.
-They hope the punishment will help
the children remember what is right.
-At this university we are interested
only with adults.
-We will measure
scientifically, step by step...
...the influence of the punishment
over the memory.
-One of you will be the student,
which will be forced to remember...
...the other one
will be the instructor, which...
...by progressive punishments...
...will force the pupil
to use his memory more efficiently.
-We will draw lots to see which one will be
the instructor and which one the student.
-I am the instructor.
-Then Mr. Rivoli will be the student.
-Do I have to sit here?
-Please.
-It's not dangerous?
-What is this?
-A solution to avoid
the eventual burns.
-Ok...
-The principle is very simple:
-Here's a list with 30 words...
...each one associated
with an adjective.
-Sky - blue, animal - fierce,
wind - violent, etc.
-You're going to read to Mr. Rivoli
these 30 pairs of words.
-After that you're gonna read to him
only the adjective...
...and he must tell from memory...
...to which word
that adjective corresponds.
-I got it. So when I'll read
the word "blue"...
...he will have
to answer "sky"...
..."animal" for "fierce"...
"wind" for "violent".
-You perfectly understood.
-Each time when Mr. Rivoli
is wrong...
...you will inflict a punishment.
-You will draw one of these sliders...
...and he will get an electric shock.
-At the first mistake
he will get 15 volts...
...30 volts for the second one mistake,
45 for the third, etc, etc.
-The sliders act incrementally,
each 15V...
...so the shocks add up.
-Now please read
the associations to your student...
...slowly, articulating well,
so that he can remember them.
-Mr. Flavius will control
the experiment.
-So... sky - blue.
...animal - fierce, wind - violent...
...day - chilly...
...lemon - yellow...
...fish - grilled...
...egg - strong...
-How do you enlist
your candidates?
-Through an ad published
in the local newspaper.
"Do you want to make 6 dollars?
...giving us only 1 hour from your time".
"We are recruiting volunteers for a
scientific experiment about memory".
-What role did Daslow play?
-Instructor or student?
-Instructor.
It was the same spot as Mr. Despaul's.
...well - deep...
...bread - buttered...
...money - satisfied.
-OK.
-Please begin, Mr. Despaul.
-The first word: blue.
-Sky! Blue sky!
-Correct.
-Next word: fierce.
-Laugh! Fierce laugh!
-No, wrong.
The answer was "animal".
-15 volts.
-Next word: violent.
-Just a second... I know...
-Blow! Violent blow!
-Wrong. The answer was "wind".
Violent wind.
-30 volts.
-Think before you answer.
-I don't like sending these
electrical shocks!
-Next word: chilly.
-Chilly, chilly...
Isn't it "fish" by any chance?
-Do you believe sincerely
that these electric shocks...
...will enhance Mr. Rivoli's memory?
-It's not Mr. Rivoli's memory
that we're interested in here.
-What we're interested in is...
...it's  Mr. Despaul's capacity to obey.
His "submission to authority".
-For Mr. Despaul  the authority is
this university...
...Prof. Flavius, myself...
...and our white overalls,
which symbolize this authority.
-We will force him to punish a victim...
...that did him nothing wrong.
-How far will he go to obey our absurd
and outrageous orders?
-In this where the whole problem lies.
-Next word: yellow.
-Lemon.
-Very good! It was lemon!
-Let's carry on.
Next word: grilled.
-Bread... Grilled bread.
-No, wrong!
It was "fish" - grilled fish!
-165 volts.
-Stop! I refuse to continue...
Please let me go.
-Are you telling me that he must
continue all the way until 450 volts?
-I don't know...
-From a certain moment on,
it's obvious...
...that Mr. Despaul
will have to face a problem.
-On one side
the submission to authority...
...carrying out
the mission he was assigned,
...on the other side the horror
of making his victim suffer
-Soon, Despaul will be torn apart
by an almost unbearable internal conflict.
-To pull himself out of this situation...
...he must disobey the authority.
-We are studying the very
structure of this conflict.
-Continue, Mr. Despaul.
-Next word...
-One moment!
-Mr. Rivoli's right hand
is untied.
-The electrode has no contact anymore.
You must tie his hand again.
-I am the one who has to do this?
-We must run this experiment correctly.
-A very interesting phase:
the physical contact.
-Until now he acted vicariously,
through the use of the cursors.
-But now he must touch a man...
...that he is torturing,
although that man did him no harm.
-In this phase the duty of obedience
usually diminishes.
-I beg you, sir! Stop.
-Why don't you focus?
Do not answer randomly!
-Let's get this over and done with.
-He asked me to stop.
What do you think?
-Please continue.
-Please focus before answering...
...because we are nearly at 200 volts here.
-The next word is "white".
-White!
-Look! Despaul tries to decrease
his inner conflict...
...by helping his victim.
-If this conflict is so intense
why doesn't he stop?
-If he stops now, he would admit to himself
that he shouldn't have gone this far in the first place.
-By continuing he justifies to himself
 everything he has done so far.
-Can we, at least this time,
pass over to the next word?
-It is crucial to continue
the experiment, Mr. Despaul.
-But he doesn't answer anymore...
-What should we do now?
-We must continue, even though
the student doesn't like it.
-He has to learn all the words
-Do you hear me, sir?
The word is "white".
-Can't take it anymore... It hurts so bad...
I can't answer anymore...
-What are we doing?
-Consider the answer as wrong
and send him 180 volts.
-This is not good at all,
we're risking a lot here!
-I take all the responsibility.
-If you take full responsibility...
-It's unbearable!
-You don't have the right to do this,
even in the name of science.
-Stay calm, General Att.
-The devices are all fake.
-There is no electrical power...
...between the desk and the chair.
-But Mr. Despaul doesn't know that.
-Mr. Rivoli is very talented,
isn't he?
-He's part of our team.
-Of course, it's essential
for all our candidates to be instructors.
-It's horrendous...
-General Att...
...you reacted at 180 volts!
-Your experiment is  merciless, professor...
-What's the voltage Daslow stopped at?
- 405 volts.
-Sit down.
-Focus well!
-Otherwise I must send you 405 volts.
-Make an effort!
-"Ecossaise"?
-405 volts!
-We must stop the experiment!
-Impossible, we can't fake the results.
We must continue.
-The subject's heart won't stand it
is obvious.
-If we don't stop
it could be a disaster.
-Apply 405 volts, Mr. Daslow!
-No way!
First, you two must agree about this!
-My discussion with Prof. Naggara
does not concern you, Mr. Daslow.
-Continue.
-No way!
-If you want, I will give you back
the 6 dollars!
-The experiment stops here,
at 405 volts.
-As soon as the coherence of the
hierarchical system disappears...
...and the disagreements appear
at the authority level...
...the subject takes advantage of it
and refuses to obey.
-Did you had many subjects
that went to 405 volts?
-on average, 63% of the subjects
are submissive,
...fully accepting the experiment.
-And they go to 450 volts!!!
-This means that in a civilized,
democratic and liberal country...
...2/3 of the people are capable
of executing any kind of commandment...
...that comes from a superior authority...
-3 months after the experiment
we summon every subject...
...to tell him the truth and ask him
to justify its own behaviour.
-Listen to Daslow's reactions.
-Mr. Daslow, you participated
3 months ago in an experiment...
...in which you applied electrical discharges
up to 405 volts to someone.
-Did you believe at the time
that the electrical shocks were real?
-Yes.
-Did you ever think about your cruelty
inflicted on your innocent...
...and defenseless victim?
-I didn't think of my cruelty...
...nor of the innocence of the victim.
-You had at that moment an authority
that should do it.
-I did what I was told to.
-When they demand a pilot
to launch a bomb...
...over a city, the pilot launches it.
-He doesn't question himself
whether it is right or wrong, he just launches it.
-But in the situation of a genocide,
when a tyrant decides to kill 5-6 mil. people...
...he needs to  have
1 mil. accomplices, murderers...
-How is he gaining
the obedience of others?
-By dividing the responsibilities.
-A tyrant needs a tyrant state,
so he will recruit 1 mil. smaller tyrants...
...every single one of them executing their tasks
professionally and without remorse...
...because nobody will ever remember
which is the millionth part of the crime.
-One of them will arrest the victims -
there are just simple imprisonments...
-Other ones will take the victim into camps,
but they are only train drivers...
-The victims will be imprisoned by the one
but he's only the prison warden.
-The most violent ones will be used
for the very final act, but...
...overall this chain of obedience
will seem comfortable to everyone involved.
-Mr. Daslow, at 360V the subject ceased
to scream and did not respond...
...which could lead you
to assume he's dead.
-Why did you continue to apply 
shocks from 360V to 405V?
-If he is really dead
he would feel nothing, right?
-I thought the professors
knew what they are doing.
-I was not the one
to contradict them.
-What surprises me is that all the subjects react
without anger, without rage...
...without vindictiveness,
without at least hoping for a reward.
-You aren't suggesting that Daslow
did all that for those 6 dollars?
-If the advertisement
wasn't published by a university...
...but by an individual that would promise you
several hundred dollars as a reward...
...would you have still applied
those 405V to Mr. Rivoli?
-No.
-What if the reward would be
of 10.000 dollars?
-I don't think you understood, sir.
-Money has got nothing to do with this.
-I will obey an authority
as long as I respect it.
-That's all.
-Thank you.
-So, that day, going up to the terrace
to shoot over president...
...Daslow was obeying
an "authority that he respected"...
...regardless of any amount of money.
-But the same authority has already hired
the real assassins, those from below...
...assassins that were working
only for money.
-Niki Farnese - the fake witness...
...Carlos De Palma - the man
with the umbrella...
...and the assassin from the 2nd floor.
-I think the assassin is
Luigi Lacosta, sir...
-We retrieved his car,
and he was shot right in his face.
-The Interpol told us that Lacosta
was known as a professional killer.
-But why wasn't his picture among
those shown to Bellony?
-Lacosta wasn't yet filed
by the police at that time.
-He arrived from Italy on March 10th...
...2 months before
the president's assassination.
-Their accounts revealed
that Nicky Farnese received...
...5.000 dollars before the murder
and the same amount after.
-Luigi Lacosta cashed two cheques of
250.000 dollars.
-So who is that authority...
...respected by one
and financer to the others?
-Daslow and Lacosta
can't speak anymore.
-Carlos De Palma?
-Is under surveillance?
-Night and day.
His calls are permanently monitored.
-What does his parole file say?
-He was released with the intervention of
Mr. Richard Mallory...
...chief of Special Activities Bureau
within Secret Services.
-What motive did he invoke?
-"High services for the country".
-He was released on
February 12 1977.
-3 months before
president Jary's assassination.
-This evening De Palma dines with
his benefactor - Mallory.
-Good job, Bob!
-I found that
in the phone tapping report, sir.
-Where will they have the dinner?
-Mallory is going to De Palma's place.
-So, with a bit of luck,
there will be no one this evening at Mallory's.
-This meaning...?
-Don't fool around, Charly, ok?
-I'll block the elevator's door.
-Why?
-Because it's the best way to 
go back down in a hurry.
-Do you know what problems
will we face there? I don't.
-Usually these actions are planned.
-Do you know it's possible
that he has an alarm system?
-You open and... driiiiing!
-What is he doing?
-If problems develop
we must not be involved.
-Charly is upstairs?
-Yes, sir.
-Alone?
-No, with a first class burglar,
Garcia Santos.
-Which we found at the Homicide dept.
-That's getting better and better...
Garcia Santos...
-Four charges for robbery...
-Three, sir... If all goes ok we promised him
we'll wipe out the fourth.
-Don't touch anything!
-Put these before.
-I Can't believe this - if I'd work on my own
I would be convicted for 3 years...
-I do this for you, guys,
and you're wiping out 3 years!
-Hallo, Vermont!
We are in - it's alright.
-Shit, it's Mallory!
-Stay calm.
-Excuse me, Mr. Mallory.
-I'm Henri Volney.
-Glad to know you, General Att.
-I hope you are not waiting for me.
-Oh yes.
-I'm not aware of being guilty.
Shall we go upstairs to have a drink?
-I prefer to walk outside,
if that doesn't bother you.
-I hear all over that the members
of the Secret Services...
...have their homes full of microphones
and other sort of things.
-That's an exaggeration.
-Do you know a certain Carlos De Palma?
-Carlos De Palma... yes, yes...
Sentenced to 5 years...
...for some tax problems,
if I recall.
-Exactly. Did you interfered
in his release?
-I interfered in few cases,
on behalf of Secret Services...
...but never on my own behalf.
-The motive in De Palma's case was,
as I remember, "services for the nation".
-I hope I'm not too intrusive if I ask you
what kind of services.
-We are called "Secret Services"
because we can keep a secret
-In our job the first rule
is the one of silence.
-This rule applies to
organizations also - such as the Mafia.
-I don't understand.
-It was a joke, Mr. Mallory,
a simple joke.
-Have you found
what you're looking for?
-No, I even don't know
what I'm looking for.
-Perfect...
-This does not change our agreement, right?
Those 3 years will be wiped out, isn't it?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah...
-Why don't you look into the safe?
-What safe?
-There, behind that copy.
-How did you figure is a safe there?
-I can smell the camouflage.
-You see this trace here?
And here?
-These traces are left by the hands
that are moving the painting so often.
-Can you open it?
-For this amateur job
there are 2 methods:
...the delicate one...
and the brutal one.
-Let's try first the delicate one.
-Obviously.
-You dislike the Secret Services,
Mr. Volney, right?
-You're wrong, I consider them
absolutely necessary.
-Without our information,
no nation can guarantee...
...the security of its people.
-Absolutely, but, sometimes,
the soldiers of information...
...are bearing away from their mission and
turn themselves into an intervention army...
...which infiltrates all over and escapes
from the control of those who create it.
-In such organizations
errors could appear anytime.
-Errors? The Secret Service's budget
is 10 bil. for intelligence dept...
...and 200 bil. for the interventions dept...
...and 200 bil. means
a whole institution, Mr. Mallory.
-So far with the delicate one.
-What's going on?
-Almost all people keep using
the same combination...
...which, when accessed repeatedly,
leads to a wear of the mechanism...
...and this one sounds differently
on the used number.
-Not so distinctively,
but it can be traced.
-In our case the wear is so small, they are
probably changing the combination every day.
-Let's try the brutal one then.
-Stay calm, General Att,
the Secret Services are under the direct control...
...of both the presidency
and the government.
-It's true, the president's
and the government's control...
...this highly effective
and discreet instrument...
...and they're using it too...
often enough sometimes...
...but when this instrument
can't be controlled anymore...
...it becomes very difficult for them
to denounce their former accomplices.
-The only one who stood up
against this inner state...
...was president Jary.
-Why don't you turn the music on?
-This is not the time for this.
-I warn you
that the explosion noise will be very loud.
-It's better to drown the noise.
-Look for something orchestral,
it makes a lot of noise.
-"Charly, he will go up for sure now! Get out of there"!
-Thank you.
-My pleasure, Mr. Volney.
-Mine too, Mr. Mallory.
-And don't let yourself be influenced
by those novelists...
...that are always writing stories
with an espionage theme.
-Even they start every story by saying
all the characters and facts are fictitious.
-When the source of imagination
is not reality, this isn't good.
-There is no suspense
without reality, Mr. Mallory.
-Good night, General Att.
-I think we obtained
what we wanted, sir.
-Why? Why is this tape so special?
-It contains music fragmented by messages
that can not be decoded.
-It must be played at a certain frequency
and speed in order to become clear.
-How did you get this?
-A lot of noise for nothing, sir.
Mallory deliberately switched up things.
-He followed the ground rule:
don't hide it, keep it in plain sight.
-Do you want to decode it?
-No, thanks.
Go and get some sleep.

May 22nd 1977.
PRESIDENT JARY WAS ASSASSINATED.
-Hello? Government Palace?
-Yes, sir.
-I would like to speak with the President.
General Att. Henri Volney speaking.
-Sir, the president is in Geneva
at the summit...
...it was published in all the newspapers.
-Of course, thank you.
Extraordinary assembly
of Minos.
Minos adopt unanimously
the triggering of the operation...
I... AS IN ICARUS
...the operation I... as in Icarus...
...must be accomplished
on June 17th...
...until midnight.
-I want to speak to
Secret Services chief, please.
-Who's asking?
-General Att. Henri Volney.
It is extremely important.
-Hold on.
-Hugues Adler? Henri Volney.
-Excuse me for disturbing you
but I need to see you right away.
-If it's a personal matter, gladly...
...but as a chief of Secret Services
I'm afraid it's too late...
I no longer hold this position
since yesterday.
-Who was appointed
in your place?
-The chief of the Special Activities Bureau,
a certain Mallory...
-Richard Mallory???
-Yes... Do you know him?
-Not so well.
-I'm beside you in these moments
and forgive me for waking you up.
-Good bye.
-Good bye.
-Mr. President, I address to you this
personal and confidential message...
...because the conclusions I reached...
...are way beyond the limits
imposed on my inquiry...
...and they concern directly
the security of the nation.
-One: I can prove...
...that the assassination
of the president Marc Jary...
...was a careful and elaborate plot...
...by a military group
apparently not linked to the government.
-This plot was organized...
...in the name of so-called
"superior interests of our nation"...
...the nation being
only an excuse, unfortunately.
-The leaders of this plot...
...did not want only
 to replace one regime with another...
...but they do know very well
the State structures and they're using them.
-Two: I accuse the Secret Services,
and especially a faction of these services...
...to be at the disposal
of this "supreme brain".
-Three: I accuse them also for working with
a renowned international crime organization
-Four: I accuse Mr. Mallory for being
the main intermediate between...
...the main leader of the conspiracy
and certain executive levels of this one.
-Five: as a part of this conspiracy,
an operation whose code name is...
...I... as in Icarus was already triggered
and should be carried out...
...today, June 17th, before midnight.
-How could we possibly know
where this operation will take place?
-With consideration, Mr. President,
Henri Volney.
-Hello, Helene?
-Yes, Henri.
-Did I wake you up?
-Nobody else could call me
at this hour, my darling...
-How was the premiere?
-Boring... they did not talk
much about my book...
...instead we spoke a lot about you.
-The women came to the conclusion
that you're a misogynist.
-And what did you answer?
-Should I have answered them?
-Yes, you should tell them that I'm busy
with a woman so hard to find...
...which in fact keeps me away
from women you can find anywhere.
-You're so nice this morning...
-How's your inquiry?
-Difficult, my dear, difficult...
-I never felt so lonely...
-And there's nothing I can do for you?
-No... Yes!
-What meaning has for you
the name Icarus?
-I.C.A.R.U.S.
-Besides of the mythological sense
known by all, of course...
-Icarus...
-Yes.
-My dear attorney, it shows
that you haven't read my book.
-I speak in there of the Icarus myth,
let me find the paragraph...
-No, I can find it on my own...
-I found it... page 198...
-Icarus was locked by Minos
in a labyrinth...
...from which he escaped using
the wings he made by itself.
-Using bird feathers and wax to glue the wings
he managed to escape...
...but, in its flight he got too 
close to the sun...
..that the wax melted,
and he fell into the sea.
-All these myths are part of the folklore.
If we consider the sun...
...as the symbol of truth...
...then Icarus paid with its life...
...for being so close to the truth.
-This interpretation can help you?
-Hello... Hello...
-Hello!
-Hello!
The experiments regarding
"obedience to authority"...
...took place between 1960-1963
at Yale University in New-Haven...
...and they were run
by professor Stanley Milgram.
