Stop, kid!
Stop right there!
It's just a stupid car.
You're gonna make it worse on yourself.
Freeze! Stop! Freeze!
Stop right there!
Now, bud, come on.
We're going over to the wall.
Get this hand behind your back!
There you go.
- What are the odds we call this a warning?
- Not good.
Let's go! We're going!
Will.
You stole a cop car.
Six years. Seven schools.
Twenty-two homes.
That's gotta be a record,
and not one to be proud of.
It's hard not to see it
as an accomplishment.
I'm glad you think it's funny.
This time it's serious, Will.
That leaves me no choice
but to remand you to a state facility.
Juvie?
Mark, come on, you can't be serious.
- You've been through a lot.
- I'll do better.
You're smart.
- Talented.
- Hey, I'll change.
For real this time.
- There's gotta be something else!
- There's not.
I'm sorry, Will.
That group home was the last option.
I know it's been hard since you lost
your parents, but you're a great kid.
I just hope for your own sake,
you figure that out
sooner rather than later.
Hey Mark,
Kristin's here to see you.
Wait here.
I'll be right back.
- Hey, Kristin, how are you?
- I'm fine. Thanks.
Kristin.
One, two, three, make a wish!
Well, today's your lucky day.
Good news. This is Kristin.
She's one of our foster parents
and her son.
George. I'm George.
Umm...
- Hi.
- Nice to meet ya.
- You too.
- Will, I was discussing it with Mark,
and we would be excited
if you would join us this year.
Where?
You are going to summer camp.
Mark, I'm not really camp material.
All right then, uh, juvie it is.
- Sorry, guys, thanks for trying.
- Wait, juvie?
George, he doesn't want to go.
No, hey, wait.
Uh...
- Summer camp sounds perfect.
- You're gonna love it.
You are gonna love it.
I'm so totally excited. You play guitar.
We're gonna rock the talent show.
Plus, there's swimming
in the lake, a zip line.
It's gonna be epic.
I'll show you the ropes.

Hi, George.
Come on.
You didn't tell me
this was church camp.
- Hey, David.
- Hey!
It's the last week of summer.
Are you ready?
Five hundred percent.
Leaves and hearts will be a-changing.
Yes! So what do you
have planned for the tribunal?
It's pretty exciting. Two words.
Braveheart!
Well, that's actually one word.
Oh.
Oh! Look, here's Will Hawkins' file.
- Oh, right.
- Social Services put everything in there.
What's this? Is this real?
He tried to sell his high school
on Craigslist?
- Mm-hmm! That boy got three offers.
- Okay.
Uh, is this kid something
I gotta be worried about?
I seem to remember
a certain bad boy back in the day.
Yeah, back when I had
a glorious head of man-hair.
Relax, Fabio. Will will be fine.
George is showing him the ropes.
It's actually kinda cute.
- You got him staying in the...
- Yeah, the legit cabin.
- Yeah, it's, um...
- It's...
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- It is.
- It is.
Mmm. She's a classic.
That's a word for it.
Hello, old friend.
You actually chose this cabin?
Yeah, I mean, who wouldn't?
The toilet backs up, when it works.
There's no AC... Oh, and the spiders.
Spiders?
Huh.
I guess they haven't
come out yet. Anyway.
Oh well.
Oh, by the way, what was that back there?
The whole family slash cousins thing?
I don't mean to be a prude,
but lying's up there on the top ten
"Thou shalt nots."
I wasn't ready.
It made me kinda uncomfortable.
- It doesn't really fly...
- Yeah, I totally get it.
- Oh, you get it?
- Yeah, I do.
Great.
That's a relief 'cause
I'm not trying to be uncool.
You like the view.
What?
The view.
- No, that's not it at all.
- Careful. Lies are up there.
What's her name?
Presley Elizabeth Borsky.
Dean's list four years straight.
Loves all things cute and cuddly,
specifically anything pug-related.
She wears the perfect
little shoe size.
Seven and a half, narrow.
We're gonna have to work on
this stalker vibe you got going on.
What about Avery? What's her story?
Way out of your league.
Trust me.
Really? Ouch.
Yeah, how should I say this?
I don't know if she'd be into the whole
"stealing a cop car" kinda guy.
First of all, borrowed a cop car.
Second of all, how did you even know that?
Oh. Georgie's got ears everywhere.
Well, then,
what would she be into?
Like, what's her deal?
Uh, this camp, honestly.
She practically lives here.
Her dad owns the place.
What about her mom?
Let me guess, she's off
saving the world like Mother Teresa.
No. She's...
Doesn't really talk about it.
She spends most of the summer
as a counselor and, uh,
this is the only time
she gets to be a normal camper like us.
And watch out, she's crazy competitive.
That makes two of us.
George, you said that telling
the truth wasn't an option.
No. I'm just not super sure
Avery would be into it.
That kinda sounds
like the same thing, dude.
I have to make this camp thing work. Okay?
If I'm going to fit here,
I have to be something I'm not.
That's where you come in.
- Right, Georgie?
- Um...
How about this? If you help me,
then I'll help you
with Miss Presley Elizabeth Borscht.
- Borscht? Barber?
- Borsky.
Borksy! Right.
All you gotta do is keep our secret,
show me the ropes.
That's it.
So I guess I'd be like...
Your Yoda, I will be.
- Yes. Sure. My Yoda.
- Mmm.
- Lesson one, my young Padawan.
- You can stop talking like that.
Shorts, wear them, you must.
You're welcome.
Got plenty. Welcome to camp.
You're a really weird dude.
Thank you.
Why are they so itchy?
Polyester blend. Or as I like to call it,
God's gift to fashion.
I smell like old people.
This is my super real cousin Will,
just visiting from out of town.
- We're related.
- Easy, tiger.
- What's the plan, Rain Man?
- Take your pick.
- Archery, baking club...
- Oh, what about that?
Nope. Don't do heights.
Okay, we are definitely
signing up for that.
Uh, no paintball, I never do paintball,
I wasn't really built for that.
- Today's the day.
- No, stop, don't go over there.
- I don't want to. Don't invalidate me.
- Hey, guys, how's it going?
Hey! It's, um, it's Will, right?
- Ah! Good memory, um, Avery.
- Thanks. Funny.
- Let me guess, you're on the red team?
- Yeah, Crimson Angels.
Did you come up with that name?
Why?
I'm just trying to decide
how honest to be in my opinion.
Oh! That's funny.
I, uh, was thinking the same thing
about your shorts.
Touché.
And you must be Presley.
- Yeah, hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
Hey, George.
George was actually just telling me
all about you earlier.
- Really?
- No, no, no...
- Nothing weird or anything.
- Right.
- I... We're cousins for the summer.
- I love the summer.
- He's my cousin and we're here.
- Cool.
- The summer.
- It's okay.
I was just showing him around. No biggie.
That's awesome, George.
Y-yeah.
This'll be fun to do it together.
- Where do I sign?
- Here.
- Don't write my name. Forgery.
- I'm signing your name.
- You'll be great.
- Excited, because...
There we go.
Thanks.
Good luck, Will...
Hawkins.
You're gonna need it.
- Luck?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- See you there.
- See you around, George.
Mm-hmm.
- Let's go.
- Yeah.
That was good. You looked good.
That time.
- Dude, what was that?
- I know.
I can talk to anybody
but Presley. It sucks.
So, it looks like George
still has a thing for you.
Come on, he can't even look at me.
Presley could have any guy she wants.
Trust me, all right? I tried last year.
I wrote her a letter every single day.
I didn't ever send them.
Maybe you should invest in some stamps.
I'm telling you,
if the two of you just would talk.
You just gotta talk to her.
Yeah.
Dude, come on.

- Lay of the land.
- Hit me.
Camp's divided into three teams.
I'm Verdes Maximus.
- Georgie boy and new kid!
- Looking good, Stuart.
- Excuse me? Did you call me Stuart?
- He's turning around.
Oh my gosh.
Why did you do that?
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey man, it's Sean. My name is Sean.
- That's what I said, right?
- That's what I heard.
- Right?
- Whatever.
Georgie, we're gonna
destroy you this year.
- Mmm-hmm.
- Because what?
We haven't lost in how long?
Oh yeah, that's right.
♪ Never ♪
- Yeah. Mmm.
- Wow.
- Good ear.
- A long time.
Maybe you'll be one of my Apostles, Will.
- Really?
- Yeah.
If you have Apostles,
doesn't that make you...
- Winners! Yes!
- Okay, got it.
So, you're a team of Apostles. Got it.
For a second there I thought you might
have an over inflated sense of self.
The thing is,
I'm not sure I'm brave enough
to pull off one of those t-shirts
in public, I'll have to pass.
Oh. That's a shame
because I sell these t-shirts
to raise money
for a cause close to my heart.
- I think that's him on there.
- On that narwhal.
Anyways, your team's not a choice.
We'll see what happens
tonight at the tribunal.
Can't wait.
Great. Awesome.
I'll see you gentlemen tonight.
- See you tonight.
- You will.
- Apostles out.
- See you there.
Great!
Hoo-rah!
Oh.
- Okay, let's be on our way.
- Will.
What is this tribunal thing?
We're gathered here tonight
on this hallowed ground
beneath the great moon and stars,
to honor an age old tradition.
Welcome to the tribunal!
Newbies! Rise!
From this day forth,
you'll be part of your tribe,
and your tribe will be part of you.
And you forever
will be part of us all.
Come forth!
Crimson Angel!

Good morning, campers.
It's a beautiful sunny day.
Everybody up. Everybody moving.
It's time to get this party grooving.
As you know, another year
of Warrior Games is at hand.
Will the Apostles hold onto their lead?
Or will another team rise
from the ashes and claim their throne?
Good morning, campers.
It is a beautiful sunny day.
Everybody up. Everybody moving.
It's time to get this party grooving.
Just make it stop.
- Hello. Earth to Will.
- Go away.
We get to kick total butt today.
Finally show Sean
and his mini-me's how Jedis get it done.
- It's gonna be epic.
- No, it's not going to be epic.
I'm 17.6 miles from civilization
and surrounded by Jesus freaks.
Wow. I feel like I should be offended
but I'm actually just impressed
with your geographical skills. Like,
did you just know that?
Rule number one:
always have an exit plan.
- That's rule number one?
- Yes, it is.
Problem is,
all roads lead to juvie this time.
Yeah, but this time you got a George.
He's not going to let you leave.
Right? I need you for the talent show.
You're what I need
to bring the performance over the top.
- And it's gonna be epic.
- Please stop saying that.
Well, it's true.
I'll quit if you quit with the "boo-hoo,
I'd rather be anywhere than this place
because I'm so broody and cool."
It's not a good look, even I know that.
Look, you have a chance to do
something really solid this week.
Help me win for the first time in my life.
Bonus, hang with Avery.
And, who knows,
maybe you'll have a little bit of fun.
Like, by accident?
So, stop whining.
Suck it up.
And help me kick some

Hmm?
- That was a pretty solid pep talk, George.
- Thank you.
Did you practice that?
I did. Was the singing too much?
I couldn't decide.
- No, that's what got me.
- The singing?
- Mm-hmm.
- Nice.
Want some Ovaltine? Apple Jacks?
- No, I'm good. I got Twizzlers.
- Nice.
Why would you get more of this?
I like it. It's camp.

- Okay, I'll do it.
- Let's give it up for the new kid!
- Wish me luck.
I believe in you!
The name is William Hawkins.
The game is five minutes of fame.
And the name of the game is to find out
who the mysterious new kid really is.
Mysterious? Huh.
Okay, all right.
Bring it on.
Favorite color?
Green, of course.
- Profession?
- Teenager.
- Favorite movie?

Favorite book of the Bible?

Ah, man, you know,
I-I couldn't pick just one.
Oh, I totally get that.
Who's your hero?
My dad.
Your favorite person?
My mom.
Aww.
Okay, all right!
Let's give it up for the new kid, huh?
Huh?
All right, who's next?
How about Georgie boy?
I believe in you, cuz.
- I don't know!
- Come on! Come on up here.
George! George! George!
- Okay, okay.
- George! George!
All right! Okay.
- You're welcome.
- Will.
Thanks a lot.
- Whatever happened, I swear it wasn't me.
- Oh, you can relax.
I don't believe for a second
you're a Twilight fan.
You don't seem the type.
- Don't judge a book by its cover.
- I never do.
I just wanna say
I'm glad you're here, Will.
That's it. So I called you out here.
Glad you're here.
Well, thanks.
Hey, by the way, what's with the name?
Aweegaway?
Yeah, no, it's Aweegaway.
You guys are taking a week away
to hang out with us.
Oh, yeah, that makes more sense.
And bonus, every once in a while,
somebody finds out they're a week away
from an experience
that changed everything for them.
My favorite part.
Here I was thinking you were a funny guy
who was a little too into Braveheart.
You're right, I am a funny guy
and I do love Braveheart.
- But don't judge a book by its cover.
- Touché.
One last thing.
Don't put my camp on Craigslist.
- I won't.
- Okay, thank you. Well, it's time.
For what?
Warrior Games, baby!
- Wow.
- Warrior Games!
- Hear ya.
- Man, is that Will Hawkins, the new kid?
Thanks a lot.
You set the bar high in there.
- I'm sure you were great.
- If awesome is good then yeah.
Oh my gosh.
Everyone's talking about you
and Sean hates it.
- Will!
- Tragic.
- That was so impressive.
- Oh, thank you.
Yeah, I mean, anyone can answer
questions, but it is about to get real.
Whoo!
Warrior Games, baby!
What he said.
- Whoo!
- That's right.
- You're gonna beat the blob this year.
- That's because I love the blob.
- This girl loves the blob.
- I do love the blob.
- That's why I do it, Sean.
- I love the blob too.
- Really?
- I do.
- You love the blob? I thought you...
- George, you know me. I love that thing.
- Great.
- My friends call me "blobtastic."
- That's cool.
- Really? You like can't get them to stop?
I've tried, but they just seem
too overwhelmed by my skills.
Of course.
Ah, well, look,
don't feel bad because when I beat you
I won't think any less of you.
Okay.
Mr. Blobtastic.
You can call me Will.
Uh, eh... Bye. Bye, George.
I didn't know you blobbed.
If we go now we could get
practice jumps before anyone else.
You wanna? Come on!
Wait, back up, jumps? You didn't say
there were gonna be jumps.
George!
Time to fly.
Can you give me
something extra on the jump?
The further I go, the higher we score.
- Hello?
- Huh?
Dude, that's pretty tall.
Yeah, it's the blob.
Wait, have you never...
No.
Yeah, great. Well, Blobtastic,
today's the day.

Get ready,
next up is an epic dodgeball face off.
Come on, Presley!
Hey! Oh, not cool.
Oh! Sorry. Didn't see you.
We can do this!
- Ow!
- Oh!
It's okay. You're fine.
Hey, good work.
Eye on the prize!
Presley!
No!
Oh!
- I'll be right back.
- Wow!
Oh, poor baby.
- Try this.
- Thank you so much.
- Hmm?
- Oh.
It's cold.
- Let me know if you need anything else.
- You're an angel.
Thank you.
Ah!
She's right there. Just go check on her.
- Come on, you can do this.
- No.
George.
It's really not that bad, you know. Sorry.
I have a bag of peas on my face, Avery.
Yeah, but your hair...
it's never looked better.
Really?
No, it's actually really frizzy
and it's a little flat.
- George, what are you doing?
- I can't go out there, forget it.
Stop pacing. Please.
Stop!
You just don't understand.
I'll never be the guy who gets the girl.
I'm Duckie. What can I say?
What? You are the cool guy, George.
- You're kinda the coolest.
- I'm a sucker.
You gotta go out there and get her.
This is your moment.
- Like one of those Jeff Hughes movies.
- John Hughes.
- John Hughes.
- That's it! You have to John Hughes me.
What?
John Hughes me. The makeover montage.
We go to the mall, you get me
a leather jacket, jeans with rips in 'em,
and killer shades. It works every time.
Come on, just do it.
All right, I'll see what I can do.
Uh...
Now go get the girl.
That was a really quick montage.

I was just walking.
- I didn't mean to...
- No, it's cool.
I thought I'd come here,
watch the sunrise.
Mh.
And George is a little perky for me
in the morning.
So...
Yeah.
Is that, um...
something that you wrote?
Uh, just a little something
I've been working on.
So he's Mr. Blobtastic
and he plays the guitar.
That is pretty impressive.
All right, I'm up here
writing moody sunrise songs.
What's your excuse?
You know, it's kind of a personal thing,
but if you wanted to, you could come.
Pass up a mystery outing?
Let's do it.
Just over here.
Are you taking me to some secret hideout?
Sort of.
- Should I be alarmed?
- No!
Okay, just checking basics.
Y'know, I'm kinda a big deal at camp,
so if I go missing,
people will come looking.
- Will they?
- Mmm-hmm.
Really?
Wow.
Pretty amazing, huh?
I come here every year.
It is pretty much
my favorite place on the planet.
I can see why.
When I was little my, um...
my mom, she got sick.
And so my dad and I
wanted to create a place
that was magical for her
when she wasn't in the hospital, so...
we made this.
My mom, her favorite were the butterflies.
There are some now,
but you come back in the spring,
I'm telling you, you...
you would not believe it.
Y'know, it's been almost eleven years.
But she's still here.
Doesn't it hurt?
Being here?
Well, yeah.
Of course, I miss her, every day, but...
I know that it's just temporary.
- So you'll see her again?
- A hundred percent.
A hundred percent? Wow.
I mean, I guess I don't,
I don't know-know that, but...
Yeah, no, I just choose to believe.
I mean that's faith, right?
What about you?
What?
Oh yeah.
Uh, me too.
Yeah, I was just testing you.
Right.
Okay, well, how did I do?
Nailed it. Of course.
You're pretty perfect, aren't you?
No.
No, I'm not.
- It's okay, you can admit it.
- No, I can't though, because I'm not.
Look, to be honest with you,
and I know you didn't mean it
in a bad way or anything, it's just...
I hate that word.
Y'know, perfect, it's just impossible.
It's like I find myself doing this thing
I know that I shouldn't but,
I'm, like, trying to be what everybody
expects me to be,
and it is exhausting.
Well, I didn't mean it like that.
I know, I...
It just seems
like you have it all figured out.

Oh. Uh...
- I live in New York with my older brother.
- Hmm.
We're super close.
I'm really lucky to have him.
I thought you said you lived in Philly.
Uh-oh! You are in trouble.
What do you mean?
I love the smell
of paintball in the morning!
- Your dad is really into this.
- Yeah. Like father like daughter.
This is sudden death!
The surviving team
wins the day!
Okay, David, you do realize
they're kids, right?
- I know.
- Okay.
Charlie! No more head shots.
And remember, watch your six.
Not the 666.
No, I was... The six is your back.
'Cause if you say twelve it would be...
I hope you know how to shoot that thing.
- Not the devil!
- No, this is not a Biblical term at all.
Okay. All right, gotcha.
Move out!
- Move it!
- Jesus loves you!
Move it!
Slay 'em all!
- Charlie's really enthusiastic.
- Yeah, we've got to call his parents.
All right, Apostles, listen up.
It is beyond go time.
Now just go out there, okay,
and do your best.
Now, I believe in you.
This is our year, 'cause we have
something they don't have.
We have Will.
I want the new kid taken out first.
Understand?
Do you think they all know
what Apocalypse Now is?
I don't even know
what Apocalypse Now is, David.
- Now, what are we?
- Red hot!
Sorry, I can't hear you. What?
Verdes Maximus!
What are we gonna do?
- Destroy.
- Yes.
Now hands in!
Masks down.

- After three
- After three. Yes. Thank you.

Points are adding up and it's
not looking good for the Apostles.
What are you doing? Get up!
George!
Wow.
That was the nicest/weirdest thing
anyone's ever done for me.
You're welcome, Georgie.
- Let's go.
- Paintball sucks.
I know.
Charlie!
I will come after you
with the wrath of God!
- I'm not playing, Charlie!
- Hey, hey.
What?
You do realize they're children,
don't you?
Charlie!
You're going down. Three.
Two.
One!
- Huh!
- Whoa!
- Why aren't you shooting me?
- Why aren't you shooting me?
We're surrounded. If we reload
and shoot each other then Sean wins.
Okay. What are you proposing?

Okay.
Let's Mr. and Mrs. Smith this thing.
Yes! Yes!

What? Y'know, it's like a movie.

- Just follow my lead, okay?
- Yeah, here you go.
No, Will, that's yours too.
You're gonna shoot both.
- Oh!
- Okay.
We got 'em, Apostles.
On the count of three. One, two, three!
Hey! Ow! Ow!
Ow! That is so against the rules!
Ow! Stop! I'm down!
Ow!
- Wow. That is so wrong.
- Aww.
I told you, Will, I'm competitive.
Excuse me boys.
That's it! Crimson Angels are the winner!
Looks like we're both losers today.
Just go.
Part of me is proud,
and part of me is neutral.
I think we got a barn burner!
Verdes Maximus is in second place!
That's my baby!
He came from my womb.
And in third place just a couple

Oh, no, no. This doesn't happen.

I pray. I give blood. What is happening?
I'm an Apostle. I went to the Arctic
and I spent two months

We lose to some guy,

God is up to something.
He's up to something good.
He's up to something amazing.
That much I know.
Ah...
I've repeated this
quite a few times to myself.
And um...
These words just mean a lot to me,
so I thought why not share them.
"For I know the plans that I have
in store for you declares the Lord...
plans to prosper you...
not to harm you...
plans to give you a hope...
and a future."
I don't know much.
But this much I do.

How are you feeling about all that?
Because I know it can be...
overwhelming.
It was amazing.
Really?
I don't know.
It's just...
been so long
since I felt so...
connected.
Like I was part of something bigger.
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah, I really do.
- Avery.
- Will.
- Sorry.
- Go head.
Just, can you wait just like two seconds?
I have something for you.
- Oh yeah, sure.
- But just two seconds, okay?
Sorry.
Come on, just tell her the truth.
I, um...
I just wanted you to have this photo.
You don't have to keep it if it's weird.
I just, um...
I don't know, it's a good picture.
Avery, I...
Yeah?
Thank you.
Yeah, it's no problem.
- So, I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah, see you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
Yeah.
Okay.
Goodnight.
- Oh, hey, Kristin.
- Hey, Will.
Hey, lover boy. How's Avery?
She gave me this.
Aww.
Man, I look good in this.
Mind if I steal it?
Yeah, I do.
Oh, Will, this is yours.
Thanks.
Oh, wow, are those your parents?
That's them.
Can I see?
Sure.
- You look just like your dad.
- What?
- Yeah.
- Really?
- You got a lot of peach fuzz though.
- Peach fuzz?
Will, your mother is beautiful.
She really is.
You know, your parents
would be really proud of you.
They'd be glad I was here.
I just thought the moment needed
a heartfelt score, it was so tender.
Nice, George.
You know what would be heartfelt?
If you picked up your drawers.
Mom.
Come on, I just wore them.
Do you expect me
to clean my room at camp?
- Why does it smell so bad?
- Boys only.
That boy stink
that just sticks on you.
They smell like old people.
I can smell your shorts.
How long you been wearing them?
They were pants.
Gotcha.
No way.
All right, campers,
now for a Warrior Games update.
In first place the Azure Apostles.
In second the Angels,
and finally Verdes Maximus
coming in third.
Now, don't despair,
I have it from authority on high
that the talent show tonight
is gonna be a game changer.
So warm up those juggling balls,
polish off those tap shoes,
and let's make some magic!
All right,
my fellow Verdes Maximus monsters,
today is the day and if we all do our jobs
I think tears will be shed,
jaws will be dropped,
and heartstrings will be tugged.
We didn't come this far to be just okay.
- We must be...
- Epic.
What he said.
Let's give it up for our fearless leader
who put this nonsense together, huh?
Okay, we're a team. But, yes,
as the leader I appreciate the validation.
Let's get started.
I am excited.
It'll be nice to have
some decent talent show competition.
- Yeah, this is a closed rehearsal, Sean.
- I'm aware.
I heard the new kid would be playing
a big part in this year's performance.
So I wanted to stop by
and offer a few pointers.
Will, got a minute?
- No, we have to rehearse.
- It's fine.
Sean, if this is about paintball,
I'm sorry, I just...
Hey, you're good. You're good.
You can't change who you are.
I get it.
What's that supposed to mean?
Like, who you really are.
Will Hawkins.
Vandalism,
disorderly conduct, curfew violations.
Auto theft?
You lied.
You're just a big fraud.
And you need to tell Avery.
Or I'm going to.
Look.
I'm trying to do the right thing.
Yeah.
Sure you are.
Keep up the good work.
Hey.
- Uh, hey. Hi, George.
- Okay.
Have you guys seen Will?
- Why? What's up?
- I don't know.
We were trying to rehearse,
Sean walked in, said something to him
and then Will just walked out.
W-wait, Sean? What did Sean say?
I have no idea.
All right, let's go find out.
Come on.
I don't want to tell you this.
Will isn't who he says he is.
What are you talking about?
Ask his cousin.
Six years, seven schools,
twenty-two homes.
You can't change who you are. I get it.
Your parent s would be proud of you.
Vandalism, disorderly conduct.
I don't know if she'd be into
the whole stealing a cop car.
I just choose to believe.
I mean, that's faith, right?
You're just a big fraud.
I'm sorry, but that's the truth.
He's lying to you.
You've gotta believe me.
You're so brave.
Hm!
Always have an exit plan.
Will.
- Dad! Hi!
- Hi, sweetie.
- Uh, can I have your keys?
- Where are you going?
Sean, I guess said something to Will.
I don't know what he said.
All I know is I checked his cabin.
All of his things are gone, he's gone.
- Well, I'll go look for him.
- No, no.
I need to go.
I think he was trying to say
something to me the other day
or I don't know, but if I go
I think he'll listen to me.
Please, you have to trust me.
Will.
Will.
Will come on, please, where are you going?
Look, I...
I know everything, okay?
Or at least I know some of it.
None of it matters,
so can you please get in the car?
- We can talk about it.
- There's nothing to talk about.
So do you just run away?
- Is that you? Is that the real Will?
- I don't have anybody, Avery.
I don't have a dad to take care of me
or a little magical garden.
That was not fair.
Yeah, you're right. It's not.
It's not fairthat my parents
were ripped from me.
That I didn't get
to tell them just once more...
You don't know anything about me.
So don't pretend you do or that you care.
Why do you think I'm standing here now?
- I don't know, you tell me.
- Because I care.
- Because you are so loved.
- By whom? God?
Yes!
Then where was he? Where was he?
He didn't take me that night, no.
He left me there.
He wasn't there for me that night,
hasn't been there since.
What kind of a God is that?
Tell me.
But you know what?
It's fine. I'm fine. Okay?
You're not gonna believe me right now,
when I say this to you but I need you to...
I don't need you to fix me, Avery.
- I'm not trying to fix you, Will.
- Yeah, right.
Fine, then you look at me right now.
- Tell me none of this meant anything.
- Get out of my way.
I can't. Because you can't look at me
and you can't say it.
- Because you know it's not true.
- It meant nothing to me.
What?
None of it.
Can I go now.
Yeah, you can go now.
By the way, you aren't
as good of a liar as you think you are.

Kristin, I'm looking at the numbers
and with that performance
the Azure Apostles take a commanding lead.
Ahh! Yes!
We're dead.
You tried your best, okay?
It's gonna be fine.
We're gonna have fun, okay?
I know.
Did you find him?
Yeah.
- Yeah, no, I found him.
- Wait, what's going on? Are you okay?
- She. George, she, um...
- I tried.
I don't think he's coming back.
But it's not over yet!
We have our final performance,
Verdes Maximus!
Yeah, that's my baby George.
And this should be epic!
- Go get 'em.
- Thanks, Mom.
I lied.
What?
It meant everything.
All of it.
Thank for coming after me.
Thank you for coming back.
I'm just... I'm so sorry that...
Your fans await.
- We'll talk after, okay?
- Okay.
- You have to go.
- Okay.
Go!

This has been a week of fierce
competition right up to the very end.
I want to say
that I'm proud of all of you.
But in the end, Kristin,
only one team can reign supreme,
and who is it tonight?
Verdes Maximus!
It's all right. It's all right.
Verde! Verde! Verde!
Good morning, campers.
It's a beautiful sunny day.
Everybody up. Everybody moving.
Time to get this party grooving.
It was a week unlike any other.
Today you take home friendships
that will last a lifetime.
Remember that today is not goodbye,
it's see you later.
Go out in the world,
the great big awesome world
and make some magic.
I want to say congratulations.
You killed it.
Thanks, man. It means a lot.
You deserve it.
You can do this.
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah, what's up?
Man, I just...
just want to say I'm sorry.
You weren't the only one
trying to impress people.
Dude, don't even worry about it.
We're cool.
Yeah, but next year you're going down.
Ahh, we'll see about that.
- ♪Later ♪
- See you, buddy.
- Hey, you.
- Hey, mind if I sit here?
Please.
So...
are you coming back next year or what?
Hmm, well, that depends.
Will you be here?
Yes.
Then chances are pretty good.
Hi.
Hey.
Uh... Uhh...
I-I-I, um...
Here.
Oh!
It's beautiful, George.
Um, yeah, the-there are
365 letters in there for you.
Um, I kinda wrote them last year
but I think thematically they could...
I'm sorry.
It's just, um...
"Life moves pretty fast.
If you don't stop and look around
once in a while you could miss it!"
From my favorite movie,
Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
Wow, someday I'm gonna marry you
Presley Elizabeth Borsky.
Not if I marry you first
George Montgomery Tanella.
Here.
See ya.
She gave me her number.
She gave me her number, I...
Jeez. Should I, like, emoji her?
Is that a thing?
So what happens next?
I don't know.
Figure out my next move.
- I'm gonna miss you, man.
- I'm gonna miss you too.
All right. You boys ready to go home?
What do you mean?
Will, I'd really like for you
to come home and live with us.
I mean, If you want.
- Are you serious?
- So, we're like legit cousins now?
No.
You're brothers.
Yes!
Yes! Thank you.
Oh my gosh! Thank you so much.
