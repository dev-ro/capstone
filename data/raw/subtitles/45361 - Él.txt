Eh!
- Where are you going? - For a walk
Now ? With twenty guests coming for supper!
I hadn't tought of that.
But I'll be back soon.
- You can't leave!
- Please, let me go.
All right! But don't bother coming back.
That it has happened to it? 
- Did he quarrel with anyone? 
- With us, never. 
He never mentioned he was leaving.
We got along very well together.
Well, if he wasn't happy here...
...he's better off gone.
Maybe there's a woman involved?
- Camilla? 
- Eh? 
- What we'll do? 
- What you want, but later. 
- I can't resist the desire to go out. 
- I have the same feeling.
But where? It's so late... 
...yes, and it's such a nasty night.
I have a friend whose house we could stay at.
I'm taking a taxi. I'll drop you off.
It's not a big trouble for me.
You're staying...and waiting for me,
Haven't you prepared the caviar? 
Madame wants the main course served first.
And she has given me l'incarico. 
Luca? 
Strange! Lucas isn't here.
Your coats will be taken upstairs.
Please. 
So despite being a colonel you're... 
...neither heroic nor loyal.
The very sound of canons make me sick.
And our---
It's a series of river which
run into the sea.
- which is death... 
- Yes, to die for one's country.
Alvaro, Edmundo wants to say something. 
For the wonderful evening given
to us by Sylvia... 
...with her creation of "The Virgin
Bride of Lamermoor."
- Bride maybe...but virgin ?
- That title would best fit the Valkrie.
Valkrie? 
I call her that because she's
quite fierce...and a virgin.
Virgin? Oh, come now. 
They say she still conserves that thing.
A perversion, do doubt. 
For the wonderful evening given
to us by Sylvia... 
...with her creation of "The Virgin
Bride of Lamermoor."
I've altered the menu. I hope
you won't mind.
We'll start with a Maltese dish...
...which they serve as an "hors d'oeuvre."
Liver, honey, almonds...
... and a variety of sauces.
Delicious I had it in Capri
while directing  a concert there.
And, as in the theatre...
"Enter, the Maltese...
Wonderful, Lucia I would never
have thought of that.
That's wonderful. 
Lucia, has a special chic in thinking... 
...up these surprises.
I don't find it amusing at all.
I've arrived in time. Don't
let him out.
Mr.Russell not doesn't like jokes. 
Take him into the garden.
Madame relieves me by that decision.
There are serious things requiring
Madame's attention.
Something very strange is happening tonight...
And the sheep?
Also those in garden. 
- Are you also leaving? 
- Yes, Madame...it's my sister...
I must see her right away.
What's wrong? Is she sick? 
This morning she didn't feel very well.
This is sheer nonsense!
And my guests?
Pardon me Madame. But everything is 
prepared and ready to serve.
I can't understand!
Aren't you happy working here?
On the contrary, I only have fond... 
...memories of the past 5 years.
Please forgive me.
And you? 
I'm going to accompany him. 
But we'll both be back tomorrow.
Don't bother. You're both fired!
wish I could please you, Madame but...
Please forgive us. 
There's no doubt they planned
this...but why?
The help becomes more impertinent each day.
You'll have to continue with the two waiters. 
What about our belongings?
We'll come back for them tomorrow.
They won't let us in tomorrow.
Wait for to me outside. 
- Just a passing jew.
- Not, it was the Valkyrie. 
What an interesting woman. 
- What's your name? 
- Beatrice. And you? 
- Eduardo. 
- Age? 
Thirty. 
- Profession? 
- Architect. 
- Single? 
- Till saturday, like you. 
We've five whole days. 
I feel admirably well tonight doctor.
Your treatment transformed me. 
It was really quite simple. 
Your ailment was significant.
- Do you dance, doctor? 
- I've never tried. 
- What a shame...
I'd like to be in your arms. 
You flatter me with that wish, but...
I've long wanted to satisfy this desire.
Did you bring your pills?
It's nothing doctor.
You shouldn't have eaten so much.
One doesn't fool with an ulcer
May I introduce you to an old friend ?
Leandro Gómez, Cristian Ugalde.
- Very Pleased. 
- Very Pleased.
- Excuse me? 
- Naturally. 
Doctor... 
...Bianca is playing. Aren't you coming?
We'll be right there. 
Why that passionate kiss?
Poor creature...
- How is her cancer? Is there any hope?
- None. It won't be three months before she's...
... completely bald. 
She has a good cranium. 
Magnificent one, like always. 
What a wonderful interpretation!
What a pity not to have a harpsichord!
I beg of you, something from Scarlatti.
Something of Scarlet, please. 
It's so late and I'm very tired.
Late? We're in the most intimate
and agreable moment of the evening.
Already!?
Wonderful, Blanca. 
Best One, Blanca. 
So the great orchestra director...
...is one of us.
It gives me great joy to know 
you under such a...fraternal aspect.
- Which lodge? 
- Dawn 21...
- sublime Column. Grade? 
- Master! 
What did you think of the
"pizzicato" we've just heard?
Sonata, sir sonata. 
May I introduce you? Mr.Ugalde and...
- your name? 
- Leandro Gómez, enchanted! 
- Would you brinh the coats out? 
- Yes, sir. 
Excuse him, he felt rejuvaneted this evening.
He drank a bit...that, 
and the late hour...
His resistance is admirable. 
One only has to see him conduct...
It takes a great effort to direct a concert.
Weel, when we retire after a concert... 
he still makes an attempt to...
... I have nothing to complain about...at times...
- I must even restrain him.
- Let him rest. Don't let him try now...
My Goodness! I don't think he'd go anything here.
No of course not. I didn't express myself correctly.
She's a little tired. 
In her state it's natural.
Rita's drowsiness is a good symptom.
Your fourth child?
I'm not sure. I've lost count.
- Are you sureof the paternity?
- Ask her. 
Science will decide that.
Blanca! I tought you had left. 
We're just chatting.
Raul says that the fauna of Rumania...
because of the climate... 
Well, enough chit-chat...I must go.
- Where's my stole? 
- A moment. 
Why aren't they leaving?
- It's almost four. 
- A matter of minutes. 
Take advantage of the farewells 
and wait for me in the bedroom.
And your husband? 
If he comes, I'll tell him I wanted
to show you the incunabula. 
Good idea. 
Everything worked out fine, Lucia.
It's late and your lipstick is fading...
And now the problem is to take care of our friends.
I have to take charge of the situation.
If you wish to spend the night here,
we'll ahve some room prepared.
I'm pleased with this cordial improvisation.
You are the ideal host, Edmundo, but I don't wish to force... 
your admirable hospitality. 
Unfortunately, I have a rehearsal tomorrow and...
a buisness appointment in four hours.
They're turning out the lights. 
We have to make a decision.
We must leave.
If the others are drunk, let them stay. 
This is incredible. 
I'd like to teach these boors a lesson.
These rigid suits are made for statues...
... not for men, especially at five in the morning. 
Isn't that a bit excesive?
Taking off his coat...
Remember Leandro lives in the United States. 
Also, this is the hour of maximum expression...
...and the pleasant temperature.
When they think back on their conduct,
they'll be ashamed.
True and I wish to spare them that embarassment.
Let us go to their level...
...to attenuate their incorrectness.
- our first night together. 
- What are we doing here? 
Why haven't we left? 
Everyone decided to stay. 
Is that natural? 
It's amusing and strange. 
I pray to You, Eduardo. 
Let's sleep. 
Good morning, Rita, did you sleep well? 
- Not once did I awake.
- I haven't had...
...such a bad night in years, even when I was in the...
...derailment of the Nice Express.
You were in a trail wreck?
- How interesting! 
- If you could see your face! 
I feel confused. What's happening here? 
How could we have done.
This is a bit excessive.
We'll have to serve breakfast.
Then they're all go home
I hope it. 
What confusion
Squashed like an---
I wasn't upset by that sight...
I must be insensible.
Insensible? Yet you fainted when
Prince Luttar died
That noble profiles!
I think persons of the lower 
classes are less sensitive to pain.
Have you ever seen a wounded bull?
Utterly numb!
I'm going to freshen up a bit.
We all look like...
...street urchins.
- Have you slept well? 
- Why do you care of me like that sister?
- I must look awful. 
- You are more interesting---
Why do you care at me like that?
I must look awful 
You're more interesting than ever.
This disarray becomes you.
---sharp ears
He passed a very bad night. 
At dawn he lost consciousness.
We must take him up to one of the rooms.
For the moment it's best not to move him.
Already yesterday evening, he wasn't feel very well.
It might be nothing at all.
- How is he, doctor? 
- In a few hours, completely bald.
- Excuses, I do not understand. 
- He has few hours left to live.
You never miss in your predictions?
- I don't feel well either. 
- Nonsense. 
Please prepare a good breakfast for our guests. 
The purveyors haven't arrived yet.
- And the milkman? 
- No, and that's strange. 
Then bring cold food and hot coffee.
Lucia, where could we freshen up?
We'll go to my dressing room.
I bet they don't leave. 
You see? And our situation here? 
It seems unbelievable. Or much too normal.
We seem to be the only conscious ones.
Why didn't you and your fiancée leave? 
Why...I don't know...
Like everyone else. And you?
I don't know. 
And that's what bothers me.
Last night someone made... 
- the slightest move to return to their homes.
- Why?
Was it normal we have spent the 
all night here...
... without elemental law of etiquette...
...like a wandering tribe of Gypsies?
I adore things which go out of the ordinary.
I didn't like the idea, but didn't 
say anything...out of courtesy.
Come on, come on, gentleman...let's not exaggerate.
The reunion was charming, the music, friendly conversation,...
... everyone in good humour.
My feet have swollen!
May I ask why our charming hostess has ordered...
...breakfast brought here and not in the dining room?
I don't know, doctor, except we are all in here...
The doctor likes to play Sherlock Holmes. 
My husband and children must be worried. 
I'm leaving right now.
We'll go with you. This is absurd.
Are you coming, Rita? 
Not yet. It's too early. 
And your children, they have to go to school.
They stay at home, under the Abbé Samson...
...a very educated man. 
He has demeanor of a saint, altought my husband thinks...
It's true, Christian? 
For God's sake, don't speak to us about Abbés now.
Pardon, gentleman. 
You know, a cup of coffee 
wouldn't be too bad right now.
I have not smoked and I feel hungry. 
I wouldn't mind a cup mylself.
Come with we, Blanca? 
I've think we've been a bit hysterical 
over something of no importance.
This is not the first time I've 
seen the sun rise at a party.
Pardon. 
Could I have a spoon for the sugar? 
Excuse the butler, he's all done.
- Giulio, bring some spoon. 
- Yes, miss... 
May I get something for the gentlemen?
Nothing. Do what you were told.
Maybe I should wait to take...
... away the breakfast dishes...
What's with you? Get the spoons!
May I suggest...
Do as you're told!
Don't you feel well?
Bianca, is anything wrong? 
What's your opinion of all this doctor? 
The strange resistance of the 
butler to carry out his orders...
... confirmation my observations. 
Since last night...
...no one even after trying, 
has been able to leave this house.
What's happening to us? 
There's a very sick man!
How is he? 
He's dropping into a coma.
If I had only the simplest heart simulant...
Christian, for his sake we must 
overcome the general apathy here...
...this man must be taken to... 
...where he can be properly attended.
The doctor's right.
Who wants to try taking him out?
Why don't you do it? We'll all follow.
It's useless. We're lost!
Sister, why did you bring me here?
It was you who wanted to come.
Calm down, clam donw.
There's no water. But a little coffee? 
I'm thirsty!
There's not a drop left.
This water smells a bit, but...
...with a few drops of lemon...
Ah! No thanks, Eduardo, I prefer to wait. 
Really, I don't understand. 
There's must be some solution!
We haven't all gone crazy, have we?
We've been here 24 hours...
...and no one has showed up.
It's the attitude of the people outside that worries me.
They should have tried something by now.
Unless everyone in the city is dead...
Why don't they come for us? 
I want to exit!
Gentleman, calm yourselves! 
There's a relationship between... 
...the help leaving and our situation.
Gentleman, please let's not bring up alarming theories...
The reason why the help quit, doesn't
have nothing with our situation.
Right! The reasons rats have... 
...when they abandon a sinking ship.
They left without knowing why.
Before you arrival, they were quite happy.
That doesn't explain anything.
We must be calm, gentleman. 
There's nothing worse than panic. 
A situation like this can't last indefinitely.
It will be foolish to think us bewitched.
Let's logically analyze this apparent...
...lock of will-power on our part.
I propose, that we all make a supreme effort...
...an energic act of the will with the purpose of...
...getting us out of this room.
Shut up, Nobilé!
That's you who have made us... 
...victims of this morbid practical joke!
For having invited you to dinner?
- To my home?
- Precisely. 
It was you who called up, one by one...
"Would you do me the honor, after the opera..." etc. etc.
We could have gone home, 
or to a bordello...
What was the reason for that impromptu invitation?
Impromptu? You all seemed so pleased... 
You, yourself, expressed cordial thanks...
Well, I don't think so anymore!
There's only one person responsible... 
...for this degrating situation...You!
Have you lost your head?
Edmundo is right. You are a fool!
If you weren't a lady... 
calm down. We go. 
What are the men doing about this? 
Bickering like a bunch of harlots!
Sylvia, think of something so that we can...
...get out of this bordello!
Please excuse his nervousness.
He's as sensitive as a little girl.
This situation affects him 
more than the rest of us.
...poor boy. 
Stop irritating me! 
I want to be alone not to hear anyone!
I'm content --- I won't see the extermination. 
I don't mind dying, but not in this way...
Without a chance to be alone with you.
If only that could be possible.
There is a way in which women 
separate ourselves from the others.
What are you saying?
I'll tell you when they are all asleep.
I lifted the lid and saw a great precipice.
And below, the waters of a torrent!
As I was sitting down,
an eagle flew by below me.
The wind blew dry leaves in my faces!
I'm cold.
- Consumatum est!
- Died? 
We should evaporate when we die.
Tomorrow, this will demoralize them.
It should have been old Roc...
One orchestra director less... 
- Were you seen? 
- I don't know. Does it matter? 
"Here the open sea begins...
"I'm not touching...
"Move down more...
Now...the rictus! Horrible!
- Yes, it is wonderful.
- My Love! 
This can't continue forever.
Four days ago, they told me...
...to set up loudspeakers so that...
...the ones inside, if still alive, could hear...
...our instructions. 
But I showed them it was absurd.
Absurd? Why?
Because simpler than installing loudspeakers...
...would be to go into the house.
And no one done that yet.
That's true. Yesterday we sent a brigade...
...of sapper with orders to get in.
In the evening they returned to their barracks.
Not one man had made it.
- But did they really try to get it?
- No and that's what ominous.
We want to enter the house!
We're not dogs!
---
One, two, three, four... 
How slow they are. It's so easy!
I have a fever, let me...
Wait your turn!
Careful! You have stepped on my foot. 
Maybe they've cut the water off.
The women first!
Listen to me...Get in line.
At first drink only one glass...and slowly.
Overdrinking could be dangerous.
Didn't you hear? Women first!
You won't brutalize my brother.
How good, how cool it is.
How --- so hungry...
Don't leave me alone.
Two days without speaking.
He's not conscious of anyone.
Not even of me.
He has what we all have,
except than is age...
...has weakened him more.
My hands... they look like withered
branches... the water was a mockery.
It will only retard the end.
What are you eating?
Just paper.
It helps fool the hunger
Isn't it nauseating?
The taste isn't disagreable.
We used to eat it in class.
Maybe because we were bored.
I studied with the Jesuit.
Good people.
We were bored, like most children.
Paper's made us the tend ba-- of
trees... so it can't be ham---
If you wish to try...
Julio, come here!
Don't go away, don't leave
me alone
Our pact...
I can't stand it anymore, I can't!
Look at how that harpy's combing herself!
I hate her!
I'd rather die than have to look at her.
Comb yourself correctly.
There, you see? Like that...
All the way back!
We can't stand your quirks.
You haven't seen a small silver 
box with pills in it?
A small box? No Rita, i'm sorry.
Are the medicine of Cristian. 
They are sure to have it capacity. 
I'll try looking for it.
Giulio, I'm hungry. Maybe there's a lump of sugar left...
There's nothing left since the day before yesterday.
Feel better? 
You'll see how the little will show up.
Someone's found it... and won't give it back...
...just to make me suffer.
I keep thinking of our young sisters...
wonder what they doing ?
My poor little children. 
But I know the Abbé will take care of them.
That's just that has been bothering me...
- The children with that hypocrite.
- Don't be unjust.
You can't deny he was courting you,
and that's a euphemisim.
- It's better I stop here. 
- No, go ahead. Speak! 
Does it interest you very much?
Your sad marital problems 
aren't worth listening to.
You're an insolent boor and I've thought...
... that of you since we've been here.
And I've had only contempt for you much before that!
Gentlemen, this does not help the situation.
We won't lose anything by treating each other with courtesy.
You'd better keep quiet, Nobilé!
I agree! How dare you give advice...
... to your victims?
My victims? Why? I'd be relieved to hear a good reason. 
I'm tired of explaining.
Edmundo, come with me, don't 
irrate them more than they are.
You're my friend. I swear I'd give...
...my life to end this situation!
I have always tried to ease the misfortunes of others. 
How can they think that!
I know, I know... calm yourself.
Alvaro, I'm hungry.
Think of something which will...
... get us out of this nightmare.
Only a miracle will get us out.
Let's all pray to the Virgin.
Edmundo and I have promised to organize a solemn Te Deum... 
... if the Divine Providence free us from this prison.
And that stench, it's unsupportable!
We're trying to eliminate it!
I'm so cold. 
Leave that hair alone.
Remember what I told you.
What can we do? She's suffering.
I can't stand, doctor!
Why don't you kill me?
Stop that foolishness! You didn't sleep badly.
Analgesics are not as urgent as food.
We don't even have ---
Don't leave me doctor. Your presence ease my pain.
If we ever get out of this trap,
I want to go with you to Lourdes.
You will accompagny me, won't you?
We'll humble --- at the feet of the Virgin because...
...only She can get us out of here.
Please try to keep calm, don't speak so much.
When we're in Lourdes, I want you 
buy me a washable rubber Virgin.
You will buy me one?
You kept this there?
We called this room the Paradise of Tebes.
Friends would meet here and we'd...
...spend unforgettable hours. 
Why didn't you show this to me?
I was frightened that the others 
would find out about it.
What was used for pleasure, can now...
The one which is served for the pleasure, will serve hour... 
... be used to relieve pain.
This contains laudanum and morphine.
Morphine? Where? 
- What was it?
- Something very interesting.
What is it? 
Tonight, I'll give you some.
- I'm hungry!
- Quiet! 
This is too much! Have some consideration... 
- It stink! 
- What? 
You smell like a hyena.
How dare you? Why does he offend me?
You should be ashamed of yourself 
to insult our misery!
Well, she does smell bad... you and I too,
all of us!
We live in our own stench like swine!
I loathe you all!
Don't pay attention. He's very nervous.
This will end badly my darling.
What I've hated since childhood: 
Coarseness, violence, filth...
Now they are our, inseparable companions.
Death is preferable to the abject promiscuity.
Satan, conqueror of the Lord God... 
...mysterious creator of salamanders and goaded bears.
Spirit of Malchut, attend and you demon of Hell...
I invoke thee, come to me, come to me...
...show yourself
She didn't realize what she was doing.
Tie her hands together.
Get her out of her!
Yes, better get an ambulance.
She has a high fever. Put cold water compresses on her forehead.
Have the highest fever. It makes them you impacchi d'acqua... 
And change it every five minutes.
Don't cry Alicia.
- it nauseates me doctor.
- But it'll calm your pain. 
Then you can sleep.
- What's today? 
- Today? 
How long have we been here?
Over a month, right?
No, we couldn't have lasted that long without food.
- I feel like we've always been here.
- I feel the same way.
And we'll always be here.
- Unless... 
- Yes? 
That we die together, lose ourselves in the shadows...
Answer me. 
Wherever you go, I'll go, Eduardo.
Look, just what we'd thought.
Yes. 
- What happened? 
- I don't know, I think I was dreaming.
- Sir, I am not blind!
- What are you insinuating? 
Your conduct is that of an incubus.
Christian, don't be foolish.
Watch what you're saying!
- Calm, getlteman! 
- Please. What happens? 
The colonel was taking advantage of the darkness.
- Filthy swine! 
- You're better to stop it!
- I challenge you to a duel.
- I accept. 
They don't let you rest here!
Nobilé's responsible for this mess!
This is just a passing storm.
Gentleman, now calm down and control yourselves.
This is unworthy of us.
Gentleman, don't forget your breeding, your education.
It was Nobilé who provoked this!
We'll show him he can't play with us this way
- I prefer not to answer. 
- We're losing our patience with you.
They fight instead of feeding us.
Get away from me!
Alicia! 
How is it possible that you...
Even the strongest are starting to lose their heads
Please, have pity on me!
Madame, I beg you... and all the rest, to forgive me.
I was out of my mind.
I'm not the same.
Again I beg forgiveness.
May I suggest a plan which I hope you all find adequate?
To avoid another such deplorable friction...
...the women should sleep on one side of the room.
The men on the other.
Excuses, you are speaking to gentlemen!
He's a degenerate! Insists on insulting us.
Edmundo, is right. 
You'd better stop talking.
Don't you understand...
Thanks. 
Andiamo, you must be much prudent.
Father, where are you going? 
I want to take the children to...
... the house where their parents are.
I know I can't enter, then I'll come out...
... and give an account of the situation.
- Are you sure? 
- Test it. 
Venga. 
I'll go to the press.
Would you want to convince that I can enter? 
I'm absolutely positive I can solve this affair
Another nut!
Go on Yoli. Don't stop!
Continue.
Ahead, walk, on! 
Ahead, it's important that you go.
Go Ahead, boy. 
Why didn't you keep going?
- Make an other attempt!
- No, it's enough. Come on children. 
So as not to fall into total abjection...
...we must keep everything...
spotlessy clear and in good order
- How do you feel? 
- All right, my head hurts.
If it hadn't been for you, no one would defended him
I had a premonition before 
going to the opera tonight...
I kept hearing a voice saying "Take the keys..."
The keys? 
The Kabala calls them "keys"... MAgic objects...
... which open me the doors to the unknow.
Blanca, hold this...
And you Sylvia, hold yours the contrary like this.
By the Lord God... the Lord Jehova...
...the Lord of Hosts, protector of the Angels, Adonai Imata
for the power that you have given to me, beautiful, powerful, arrogant... 
we, your victims, beseech you...
... free us from this magical circle. 
I can't read it... innocent blood is missing...
We'll wait the sacrifice of the last sheep
- Juana? 
- What do you want? 
Look.
In the closet!
Gentleman, friends... 
What happens? 
Both of them...Eduardo and Beatrice!
Help me keep them away.
How did they...
- It doesn't matter
- They have been killed? 
Please go away...
Why you laugh? 
I was thinking... 
...if I were to push you into the salon?
Try it and I'll kill you.
What's that? 
They've probably gone batty.
It's the Masonic cry for help.
Freemasons must answer the call.
But here... Unless it's the bear...
Christian, the moment has come!
The Unpronounceable Word!
- Yes. 
- H. 
- I. 
- H. 
- H. 
- Or. 
H. 
Save me! Quick Shut the windows!
Save yourselves! 
They're coming by the millions!
It's late now, son. You must to go to bed.
I'm not sleepy.
What a multitude!
He died in mortal sin!
Oh my beloved son...
I shall never see you again!
There, at the summit!
Do you see him?
The Pope!
Yes, that's him. What majesty, how solemn...
He resembles a warrior!
Let me fix your pillow. 
Goodnight my son.
Goodnight mother. 
It hasn't changed. Looks like a tomb.
And the yellow flag? 
The house has been put under quarantine.
Pablo? 
What brings you here?
We wanted to know if there's any news.
Maybe they've all died.
Really? 
Sometimes foul airs reach the street.
Most probably the food rotting in the kitchen.
Don't shoot!
I work here.
I'm a butler in this house.
The cooks and the maid. Did you tell them we were coming?
- Not a word. 
- Why are they here? 
I don't know.
Let's find out. Maybe there'S something new.
Paul said, if Nobilé dies, we're all saved.
When the spider dies, his web falls.
If he had noblesse oblige, he'd know what to do.
We must kill... 
I demand that you refrain from talking in such a manner.
What are you plotting? Speak out!
We want to get rid of him.
Have you all become insane? 
You're completely irrational!
We just want to get out of here!
We don't want to hurt you or the doctor.
Necessity excuses our action. 
- Uccidetelo! 
- Kill him ! 
- We must kill him. 
- Why waited for? 
Listen to me!
Kill the doctor. He against us too!
Think of the consequences of 
what you are about to do.
This vile act won't be the only one.
This presupposes the disappearance...
... of human dignity.
Out of the way, or I won't be 
responsible for what happens.
Enough talk!
stop It, Raul! It won't resolve nothing. 
Violence is not necessary. It's useless to fight over...
... something so easy to get.
Thanks. 
Edmundo, just a moment, don't move.
- What's the matter? 
- I don't know. That is I do know...
It's so... so extraordinary.
How long have we been here?
Imagine the changes in position...
... of each one of us, as in a chess game...
... the thousand combinations possible...
... during this horrible eternity.
Even the furniture. We've changed 
their places a hundred times.
Very well then, at this moment,
we all find ourselves...
... persons and furnitures, in the exact positions... 
...and places of that first night. 
Or is it another hallucination?
Please tell me.
That's true. I was here and you beside me
Yes, are true, I were and you to my flank, true Rita here? 
- And you on my left... 
- I was here! Just the same as now!
Yes, we were on this couch.
And I held your hand.
I don't remember.
After dinner, I sat down at the piano.
And you were there!
- That's true. 
- What's the point of all this? Who cares?
Do you remember what you were playing?
Perfectly. A sonata of Paradisi. 
Then play... just the ending!
Don't you hear me? Play!
Suonala. 
You were standing behind me.
Applaudite Blanca!
You come down and away from the piano.
A few of us approached...
Who spoke first?
Please try to remember!
- What a wonderful interpretation. 
- Answer her Blanca. 
- Blanca, what would you have answered?
- Yes, yes. 
What a pity not to have a harpsichord!
Beg of you, something from Scarlatti.
"It'S too late to continue playing" wasn't it?
Yes. It's too late and I'm very tired.
That's true. We're very tired.
We should all retire.
Isn't that true gentleman? 
That's true. We're very tired, we should all retire.
It's what we've wait for? 
Then let's go! Follow me!
Andiamo! 
We are free! It's ended! 
Soon! Free, free! 
This way, gentleman! 
Yes, we're free. 
We're free! 
- Cognac from the house? 
- Only one bottle left.
Look... a light! 
Camilla, come here! 
- Look the light! 
- Oh! 
They are alive! 
- Let's go in!
- You first! 
Let's go come here!
Shall we wait until everyone is out?
- Why? 
- Because... 
- Father? 
- Yes? 
Look. 
Does it work? 
- Let's wait till everyone is out.
- Good idea.
I forgot my prayer book.
- What's the matter? 
- Let me through!
I'll explain...
Go ahead first... I'm in no hurry.
