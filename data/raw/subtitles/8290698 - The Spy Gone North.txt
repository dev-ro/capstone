After WWII, Korea came under the divided rule
of the USA in the South and USSR in the North.
On June 25, 1950, the Korean War broke out
causing more than 3 million casualties.
Even after the Armistice, a cold war reigned with
both sides sending countless spies over the border.
This film is based on the real-life case of
'Black Venus' who operated as a spy in the 1990s.
All characters and incidents have been
fictionalized and may differ from real events.

THE SPY GONE NORTH
North Korea, responding to
the IAEA's demand
for inspections of the
Yongbyon Nuclear Reactor,
has announced its
withdrawal from the NPT.
Both South Korea and the U.S.
called emergency meetings,
resolving firm countermeasures
against the North,
as the Korean peninsula
plunged deeper into crisis.
Directed by YOON Jong-bin
Get him!
Hey.
Hey!
What's going on?
Let go of me!
What are you doing?
Mr. Hwang Byung-chul?
- What is this?
- Don't move!
Who are you?
I handle foreign operations
for the Nat'l Intelligence Service.
You'll have to come with me.
Why are you doing this?
Who are you?
- Grab him!
- Let go!
In January 1992,
an NIS intelligence agent
asked me to spy on the North.
He said stopping the North's nukes
was the only way to save Korea,
so I agreed to become a spy.
From that day on I had
to become a new man.
I drank every day,
gambled frequently.
I had to erase my former
self as a military officer.
Here's $10,000.
I borrowed from old comrades,
supposedly to start a business.
You never used to drink,
what's gotten into you?
And why'd you quit the defense agency?
You could've been
lieutenant-colonel in no time.
You be a colonel.
I'd rather be a company chairman.
Thanks a million!
After borrowing from here and there,
my debt snowballed in no time,
and finally my credit was ruined.
This was to mislead any spies from
the North, and wipe my identity.
It was my first mission.
Bye.
My second mission was to bring
physicist Kim Jang-hyuk, who knew
key facts on the North's nuclear program,
into South Korea.
March 1993, Nat'l Intelligence Service
Interrogation Room
What the hell is going on here?
Sit.
Mr. Hwang Byung-chul.
As you know, we're facing a major crisis
because of nukes in the North.
I know nothing about that.
Perhaps not you.
But your professor
Kim Jang-hyuk knows well.
He visited Pyongyang often
for that very reason.
But then...
What's going on with
the friend I was with?
Are you aware he's a spy
sent by the North?
Even if you didn't know,
in South Korea, you can be deported
just for meeting him.
And if the matter is serious,
you can be punished
under the Nat'l Security Law.
I can't believe this.
Then...
what should I do?
You must be busy.
Thank you for coming all this way.
What do you mean?
You think I'd miss this?
I'm here for the symposium,
but I came to see you.
Thank you so much.
Let's go.
Please take your seats for the Symposium of NE
Asia Promotion of Peace and Int’I Cooperation.
Professor?
Yes?
Let me introduce you
to an important person.
Ready for cleaning.
Close the windows.
There is a fire alarm in the hall.
Please use the nearest
emergency exit to evacuate.
I repeat.
Please use the nearest
emergency exit...
I am a nuclear physicist.
But I work for a Chinese university,
so I know nothing
about matters in Pyongyang.
A nuclear physicist who visited
Pyongyang 26 times this year
doesn't know about the
nuclear program?
It's hard to believe.
I'd better go now.
The symposium is about to start.
You don't need
to attend the symposium.
This entire symposium was
just a front to bring you here.
Have a drink.
I hear your university salary
is $45 a month.
I believe you're worth
more than that.
If you cooperate,
I'm prepared to pay you
$100,000 right now.
200 years worth of salary
in one payment.
You've got my attention,
but I can't tell you
what I don't know.
I hear your wife worries about
your kids' university admissions.
We can help with that as well.
Helping my children, or $100,000.
I should choose between the two?
$100,000 and your children's careers.
Two for the price of one.
The nuclear program was boosted
after the Eastern Bloc fell in '89.
Based at the Science Academy
in Pyongsong,
overseen by
Kim Chaek University researchers.
So now, 4 years later...
You ask if North Korea
is developing nukes?
They're not developing them.
They already have the nuke.
You mean the North already
possesses nuclear weapons?
Whether weapons exist is a top secret,
known only by top officers in Bureau 131,
under Kim Jong-il.
They say it's for energy,
but if they can enrich plutonium,
weapons are just a matter of time.
Your next job
is to infiltrate the NK elite
and see what they're doing.
The NK External Economic Committee,
in Beijing.
The director is Ri Myong-un.
A top graduate of
Kim Il-sung University,
he handles all the North's
foreign currency trading.
He's not affiliated with military
or security, so he has no rank.
But his influence in the North
is unimaginable.
He's the only person we can access
who meets Kim Jong-il privately.
To approach him,
take the role of a businessman.
Only three people including me
know your identity.
It's going to be a solitary fight.
Can I ask who
the other two people are?
Me, the intelligence chief, and...
Code One.
On the day that Pyongyang falls,
I'll meet you by Taedong River.
Infiltration of North Korean elite

March 1995
Beijing Traditional Market
I've lost many good men in
Beijing and Dandong.
Some kidnapped to the North,
others murdered in cold blood.
You need to be
the perfect salesman.
Anything wrong with your face,
clothes or behavior,
and they'll find you out at once.
You said you’re from
South Gyeongsang Province?
Ta-dah!
Take a look!
You'll never find products
like these anywhere else.
It wasn't easy
stocking so many!
Pull the trigger on this beauty
to hear its true worth.
Here.
Shut up,
or I'll blast you to bits!
And it even has
a second stage attack!
I'll incinerate
you capitalist pigs!
What do you think?
Kiyohara Hisashi,
an ethnic Korean from Japan.
Probably the only route to approach
External Economic Council of NK.
What about the NIS'
contacts in Beijing?
This is a contact planted
by our White Agents.
He's ethnic Chinese,
so he knows a lot and can help.
Everyone calls him Dr. Jang.
He's said to be close
with North Korea,
but since he's
driven by profit,
neither North nor South
really trusts him.
So my only option is to
rope myself to Kiyohara?
That all depends on you.
Wait!
How about some
Mt. Sindok mineral water?
It's filled with ions and
amino acids.
Great for health!
Great, my ass!
You think after 3 months
of running around in Beijing,
I'll go back with
a bunch of kids' toys?
Would you buy that for your kid?
Who's the one
getting screwed here?
There are no borders with toys.
In Pyongyang these are
completely sold out!
Are you an idiot?
Get me something I can
slap a fake tag on, asshole!
Cigarettes or cars!
First, if you buy all those toys,
then I'll set you up.
You bastard...
How many drinks
have I bought you?
Look, Kiyohara.
You're out. Beat it.
Wait!
Wait!
Hey Mr. Kim!
Don't you know anyone else
around here?
I'm about to blow my top.
I can't find North Korean
products anywhere.
The traders here
are all small fry.
There's no money in it.
Just pocket change.
The streets here are filthy,
I hate the food.
It's driving me crazy.
Damn, you know how it is.
I'm loaded with cash.
I can pay the admission fee,
just can't find anyone
to sell me a ticket!
Give me that.
I'm buying something,
I'll call you back.
It's a real Rolex!
It's a great product.
Millennium Hotel, Beijing
God, I'm tired.
I spent the whole day
looking at samples.
Yeah.
What are you talking about?
I came here to work,
you think I'm lying?
Yeah, I'm thinking things over.
If nothing works out,
I'll just go back.
The handover of Hong Kong
is in a couple years.
I can try my luck there.
How long will it take?
Couple weeks at most.
A couple weeks?
Is that possible?
Of course.
If you find any leads,
let me know.
We'll keep in touch by phone.
All right.
I'll call you then.
Wrap things up well
this time, okay?
God, when I think of
that Bolshoi performance...
Chairman.
Don't worry yourself.
All right, then.
Okay.
We'll talk later. Bye!
Good luck!
It's been 6 months since
I contacted Kiyohara,
who is close to the
External Economic Council.
I still haven't met any
senior North Korean officials.
But today they started
bugging my room,
and the hairs I placed
around the room were moved.
It's a sign that senior officials
have been told about me.
An intelligence officer
turned rich businessman.
Time to throw those cash-starved
Northerners some irresistible bait.
Incheon Harbor, Pier 4
It's Lunar New Year,
so we're running low.
Half walnuts and half jujube.
Yes, $400,000 worth.
From North Korea.
I'll fax you a purchase order.
Yes.
Hello, is this the news channel?
I've got something to report.
Agricultural goods disguised
as North Korean products
are increasingly being smuggled
into the country.
Chinese products with
North Korean packaging
are being imported under...
Hey ma'am.
Is this kimchi from Korea?
We made it ourselves.
This is Pacific Industries.
Good day?
You think this is a good day?
Have you seen the news report?
You sent us Chinese goods
claiming they were North Korean.
Now the shipment is seized
and we're about to go bankrupt.
And you say good day?
Jang Sung-hoon's Office, Beijing
NK office for foreign currency earning
First if you process the payment,
we'll re-send the shipment and
make sure it's all North Korean.
Have you gone mad?
I'm not paying unless
you send a new shipment!
Hello?
What did he say?
What now? If we don't
pay the Chinese suppliers,
they're sure to report us!
'Self-reliance ideology is our life'
- Kim Jong-il
Count it properly, okay?
- Freeze!
- Who are you?
- Arrest him! Get them all!
- I'm sorry.
We'll pay you back!
Come with us!
We can pay you!
NK External Economic Council,
Beijing
Yes!
Yes!
I'll do as you order, Comrade!
Pyongyang?
Comrade Jang Sung-taek's
nephew Jang Sung-hoon
sold Chinese walnuts to the South,
labeled as North Korean.
He got caught and
the Chinese police arrested him.
What does the Party say?
They said rumors spread
across Beijing 3 hours ago,
and asked why didn't we know?
Since it disgraces
the Party's reputation,
they said to resolve it quickly.
How much money
do we need to cough up?
$250,000.
How much does the EEC have?
If we pool everything,
about $100,000.
Is there anyone
we can borrow from?
In that case,
first report to the Director.
Hello?
Mr. Park Suk-young.
I'm Director Ri from the DPRK's
External Economic Council.
I'd like to meet you.
Right now?
All right, then. Where?
Come out of your hotel now.
I'll send a car.
Change of location.
Go out the back door.
Turn left out the back,
and go to the night market gate.
Buy some flowers?
No!
Go through the market
and out the back gate.
Watch where you're going!
Turn right and go
around the corner,
and you'll see Hui Jia Mansions
block 3, number 2.
Go through the gate
and keep walking.
By the exit you'll see
Koryo Restaurant.
I'll meet you there.
No one's following him.
Koryo Restaurant
We need to search you.
Hey!
He's our guest,
what are you doing?
These days snoopers are
raving to frighten our Republic.
Our comrades
have become sensitive.
Forgive me,
you must have been startled.
No worries!
If you want honey,
sometimes you get stung.
You have an audacious spirit.
Let's go.
Ri Myong-un Director, EEC
There's not much
to say about myself.
I'm just an ordinary person.
You can just call me
Director Ri.
I'm Park Suk-young
of Seoul Trading Co.
Park Suk-young
This is our first meeting,
and whether it will be the last,
I don't know yet...
The world is filled
with things we don't know.
Please, speak openly.
Before talking about business...
Tell me openly if you can help
with Comrade Jang's charges.
That's right!
I saw the news.
He's being held by the police?
Well, why not?
I should help
a compatriot in need.
Good.
We seem to be on the same page,
so let's cut to the point.
I'll ask just 3 things
about your business.
You used to be in
South Korea's defense agency?
Yes, in the intelligence division.
Before you were expelled,
you got yourself in debt?
You know money, it's a mystery
how quickly it disappears.
Didn't expect to hear that.
Did you study Marx's proverbs
at the defense agency?
Sorry, I swallowed wrong.
Now the second question.
What do you want
to buy from us?
Well, profit is blind.
Whatever makes money!
Last question.
Can you give us intelligence
about South Korea?
You move fast, but now
you've jumped the rails.
I'm just driving straight.
You mean state secrets?
Just be open about what you know,
and we'll be satisfied.
It's to build trust between us.
Don't misunderstand.
Can I ask a question?
Sure.
Do you want to do politics,
or make money?
I might believe that a man
expelled from the army
is now engaged in business.
But the Party won't be
so easily convinced.
I get what you're saying.
But I wasn't expelled.
I turned in my resignation and left.
Get your facts straight.
Nat'l Intelligence Service
Safety House
He's not going to be easy.
He kept his emotions hidden,
and skillfully used persuasion,
threat and reassurance.
He seems to have an iron will.
Here's what you requested.
Pretty much any official
will have heard of this intel.
Not even top secret.
Can you convince them with this?
When they said "be open",
there was a hidden meaning in that.
Here.
From the case to the movement,
this is a work of art that
even Rolex would think is real.
Use it with confidence.
And be sure that
the product you decide on
gives you a pretext to
visit North Korea.
Something requiring inspection,
that's located near the Yongbyon Reactor.
For example, zinc or iron ore.
First I'll listen to
what they have to say,
then pull them along
at my own pace.
Don't you think it's time
to record their voices?
We at least need to give the
analytics team a recording.
Good afternoon.
The $250,000 that Jang
borrowed for his products,
plus another $10,000
to bribe the police,
so $260,000 in total.
And this is the information
you requested.
Introduce yourselves.
This is Jong Moo-taek of the EEC.
Nice to meet you.
Park Suk-young, Seoul Trading.
Jong Moo-taek.
Then I'll leave you two
to discuss things.
Congressman Kim Sang-tae
maintains two homes.
The second is with
actress An Su-jin.
What is this?
What do you mean?
It's as it says.
I mean, is it true?
It used to be.
Whether it still is, nobody knows.
An Su-jin...
Never would have guessed.
But we'd prefer other info.
What about field manuals,
or satellite imagery?
You've got nothing new for us.
I told you before,
it's been a while since
I left the defense agency.
Please understand. Oh my...
I'm from the State Security Dept.,
sent to the EEC on assignment.
So I'm not on the same path
as Comrade Ri.
What's your path?
You just want to make money?
You bet I do!
That's why I came all this way.
Business!
In that case, don't bother
importing goods.
Pass over military secrets to me.
It'll depend on the information,
but for top secret material,
I can pay $300,000.
Goddamn it!
How many times
should I tell you?
Look, I quit the army
and came kowtowing here
in order to support my family,
but I've had 20 years of
anti-Communist education,
and the word 'commie' still
sends shivers down my spine.
But Jesus Christ!
You want me to be a spy?
Don't give me that look.
A businessman refusing money?
So your goal never was to get rich.
Of course, the Party
will ultimately decide,
but I don't think your business
with us is going to go well.
Wow. Forget it, then!
To hell with it.
You think I can't make
money somewhere else?
Shit.
Damn North Koreans
can't be trusted.
Mr. Park. How could you leave
without saying goodbye?
Are you kidding?
You called me here to play games?
I see we've upset you.
Shall we have dinner?
Forget dinner. I'm not hungry.
Are you still staying at
Millennium Hotel?
Why ask if you already know?
I'm going to pack up
and go home.
Then I should see you
before you go.
Meet me in 30 mins at the
Sky Lounge restaurant.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Will you hold this for me?
Can I have your name?
We need to search you.
Comrade Jong.
It's for the protection of
an officer abroad.
Oh my.
My apologies, Mr. Park.
What a beauty you have here.
Have a seat.
Oh no.
I'm sorry, but I don't drink.
I'm aware you've had trouble
with drinking since your army days.
Are you mocking us?
Mocking you? Not at all.
I used to drink a lot,
it's true.
But for personal reasons
I quit drinking.
Let me pour you a glass instead.
If you offer a drink,
you should accept one.
Otherwise we'll assume you lack
the will to do business with us.
We North Koreans don't negotiate
with someone we haven't drank with.
It's not that I wouldn't like to.
Do I really have to explain this?
Actually my father died
because of alcohol.
At his funeral, my mother clasped
my hand and begged me.
Please stop your damned drinking.
Now you sell your
family history over a drink?
You're a shallow capitalist
inside and out!
Huh?
What the hell did you say?
I'm selling my parents?
Who do you think you are, anyway?
How old are you,
you little Commie pipsqueak?
Will fear teach you
some manners?
Ha, you're fucking crazy!
Go ahead and shoot, asshole!
Who the hell raised you anyway?
Comrade Jong.
We're all in the same boat here,
but sharp words like 'fear'
might cause a leak.
Do you want us all to sink?
Mr. Park is right.
We should follow
our parents' wishes.
We've much to learn from you.
I'm really sorry.
I should have controlled myself,
but my temper...
Wow, my face is all flushed.
Better get some fresh air.
Excuse me.
Comrade Jong.
You don't want to earn money?
When Mr. Park returns,
excuse yourself and go out.
An hour later at 9:10 PM.
Unusual behavior detected.
- The items I left before.
- Mr. Park.
Here you are.
Thank you.
Mr. Park.
You've been gone a long time.
Get him.
Don't touch me, you bastards!
Hey, when are you going to quit?
Why do you keep feeling me up?
Foreign trade is
the Director's responsibility.
Mine is national security.
Search him.
What the fuck?
Let go, assholes!
I'm not working
with you bastards!
Damned Commies!
Call the police!
Help me!
Help me!
- Rolex?
What's going on?!
Comrade.
I'm just following the rules
for the sake of revolution.
I know.
You're trying to do your job.
But you know
what the problem is?
The Party ordered us to
receive him courteously.
Go.
Wait, is this a Rolex?
Such a precious thing,
thrown on the floor!
Mr. Park.
You brought three of them?
Well, I just...
Under the direction of
our great leader Kim Jong-il,
we offer you, our nation's
dear guest, Mr. Park Suk-young
the warmest of welcomes!
Oh my.
Thank you.
Gosh.
As for cigarettes and cars,
the light industry bureau
is already putting
Made in North Korea labels
on Japanese and Chinese products
and re-exporting them abroad.
Doesn't make sense
to compete with them.
And there's not
much profit in it.
So I don't think we can do
your preferred business.
Then do you have another
product in mind?
We can also import minerals,
like zinc or iron ore.
From our point of view,
rather than specialized imports,
we'd like you to propose
something more long-term
that could benefit both of us.
You mean partnering
with South Korean companies?
That's right.
Wow...
There are tons of companies
who want to enter North Korea.
No conglomerates.
That's the will of
our General Kim Jong-il.
If conglomerates are out,
then what do we do?
That's why we need you.
As you said,
your time living in a capitalist society
have taught you how to
utilize capitalism.
If we like your proposal,
we'll consider granting you
exclusive business rights.
I've been coming here since
Jiang Zemin took power,
and much has changed
in those 2 years.
That's the power of
market reforms!
This antique was discovered
in a Koryo Dynasty tomb.
It's not easy for us,
so we'd like you to convert it
to cash in the South.
As an antique,
this has absolutely no value.
But it's strange.
If it was really given
to you by the North,
then it ought to be real.
Then what would the price be?
If it were real,
about $500,000?
If I pay them a lot, they'll
suspect someone's behind me.
But if I don't,
the deal might collapse.
I think it's a test.
It's an open secret
that Office 39 smuggles antiquities
to finance Kim Jong-il's slush fund.
If it were real,
they'd really be looking for cash.
But since not,
they must be testing you.
How's the business plan?
You think it's really possible
to shoot ads in North Korea?
The President has already
given the go-ahead.
We only need the CIA's approval.
If you can take a camera team
and move freely in the North,
you'll eventually be able to check
on their nuclear facilities.
It means we can see
our enemy up close.
The advertisement is like
a Trojan horse that will let us in.
If we officially start
business with the North,
we need the
Unification Ministry's approval.
So I need to find
a good Trojan horse.
Han Chang-ju, age 43.
After working 15 years as
an advertising executive,
he went independent,
and shooting an ad in North Korea
is his long-held ambition.
Back when I worked at Cheil,
you know that ad
for Coca Cola with Shim Hye-jin,
on the chin-up bar? That was mine.
But now a top star isn't enough.
At the peak of Mt. Baekdu,
that crater lake...
Ruling Party Crushed
The opposition Democratic Party
has won big in local elections.
With Kim Dae-jung's return to politics
they control the political discourse...
Hello.
We moved in next door today.
So I brought you
some rice cakes.
Oh, hello. Thank you.
Who is it?
He moved in next door.
This is my husband.
Nice to meet you.
Sure I'll be seeing you.
Yes, nice to meet you.
Advertising is all about issues.
If I could make this work?
Oh, thank you.
This looks great.
It'd be all over the news,
a sensation!
But what can I do?
Can't get a foothold in the North.
I've just been
throwing away money.
Wow.
I should have met you
a few years ago.
Wait, the trading you do
isn't with the North, is it?
Suk-young? How about
doing business together?
I don't know anything
about advertising,
how can we work together?
What's there to know?
You've got a product, an actor,
a location, and you shoot.
Leave all that to me.
I've been doing it for years.
Suk-young?
As Kim Dae-jung hopes for continued
success in the April general election,
the ruling party pledged to stop
the opposition's momentum.
Thank you.
Which party do you think
would be better for our business?
Lee Hoi-chang New Korea Party
Not sure.
I don't follow politics.
Let's think about it if next week's
Beijing presentation happens.
You're right.
Fuck, I'm getting ahead of myself.
To protect our nation's
sovereignty...
Kim Dae-jung Democratic Party
Nat'l Intelligence Service Chief
Kim Jong-chan
Director Choi.
Why do Kim Dae-jung's
poll numbers keep going up?
The boost in his popularity
seems like a temporary fad.
A fad?
The way I see it, the people
are hypnotized by Communists!
Foreign operations are important,
but our people come first.
Our people are being hypnotized,
will the NIS just stand by?
If it lasts from the general election
to next year's presidential race,
you think you and I
will still have a job?
Director Choi, I'll keep it simple.
This mania for Kim Dae-jung.
Stop it.
Snuff it out!
Millennium Hotel Nightclub,
Beijing
Watch where you're going!
Chief, hello!
Director Ri, how have you been?
Good to see you.
Our wrists are all shining!
Without selling anything,
just renting locations,
you can earn a decade's
worth of profits!
This is a total win-win deal!
It's surely an interesting proposal...
What?
Is the Party still holding back?
What do you think?
Advertisements, the very
symbol of crooked capitalism,
being shot inside our Republic?
Ridiculous...
Mr. Jong, we're all one team now,
don't be so negative.
Comrades.
Why don't you go out and dance?
Director, advertisements
are only the start.
Once it catches on, tourism and all
will make you huge profits.
Mr. Park.
I'll be honest with you.
Yes.
Advertisements are not
something my team can decide.
I'll need to go to Pyongyang.
I'll fight for it,
and let you know in 3 days.
Will you wait?
Of course I will!
I've waited 9 months,
what's 3 more days?
And here's what you asked for.
The cash from the antique.
Director Ri!
Did you give me a fake
in return for that fake watch?
As an apology, I bought you some
medicine you can't get in NK.
I'll contact you soon.

Armed provocation in Panmunjeom
Today at 1:25 AM,
260 North Korean soldiers
entered the Joint Security Area
JSA Security Room
and bombarded
a portion of the DMZ.
Responding to this
armed provocation,
the U.S. Forces Korea
issued an alert,
and are preparing for any
further hostile acts.
The Korean army ordered
its soldiers to mobilize...
...prompting the government
to raise its alert level
from WATCHCON 3 to WATCHCON 2.
...the first time since 1982
to reach WATCHCON 2.
At this clear violation
of the 1953 Armistice,
150 NK Soldiers,
Armed provocation in DMZ
the U.N. decided on
a firm response.
The President described this act...
Director Choi speaking.
Sir.
What's going on at Panmunjeom?
What do you think?
The Commies are
shooting at us again.
Luckily, no signs of
nuclear weapons yet.
You get that deal wrapped up.
Why no news?
I'm waiting too.
That's why I asked
about Panmunjeom.
It might affect the deal.
Press on,
with belief in your nation.
Until our tanks reach
the Palace of the Sun, okay?
Kim Dae-jung suffered a clear
defeat in national elections.
Analysts believe North Korea's
recent provocations
New Korea Party: 140 seats
Democratic Party: 79 seats
caused voters to prioritize
security concerns.
See, you need to stir the people's
emotions for them to vote properly.
Anyway, nice work.
The VIP is very pleased
with the election results.
Wrap things up neatly
so there are no leaks.
Yes, sir.

Suspicious Death of
Korean-Chinese Man
A strange feeling
has come over me.
As if Pyongyang and Seoul are
acting independent of Beijing.
What led Dr. Jang to meet
with Director Ri?
Kim Dae-jung opposes
needlessly provoking the North
Is his death and the
North's action connected?
Hello?
Mr. Park.
This is Pyongyang.
Director Ri! It's been a while!
Sorry to keep you waiting.
No problem.
How are things
with the ad project?
Regarding that...
You'll have to come
to Pyongyang.
What?
Pyongyang?
Our Great Leader Kim Jong-il
would like to meet you.
April 27, 1996 Sunan Airport
Pyongyang No. 32 Villa
Let's go.
If you want to meet the greatest figure
in our Republic, you must be clean.
If you were to pass on
an infectious disease,
that itself could cause
a national crisis.
Think of this as a chance to
check your health more precisely.
You'll wait here until
we have the results.
One more thing.
Due to lack of power there may
be blackouts, don't be alarmed.
April 27, 1996.
Section Chief Jong Moo-taek,
State Security Dept. of DPRK,
will interrogate official visitor
Park Suk-young of South Korea.
State your name and affiliation.
State your name and affiliation.
Name Park Suk-young,
South Korean Defense Agency.
Mr. Park, change your clothes
and come out.
Did you sleep well?
It's a required procedure,
so don't let it bother you.
If you end up exposed
or detained,
the government and the NIS
will deny everything.
In a worst-case scenario,
make your own decision.
We're turning onto Route 9.
Attention!
State your department and rank
within the Defense Agency.
Intelligence team A23, officer.
What's your purpose
in coming to Pyongyang?
An order from my superior.
Right...
Who's the superior
who gave the order?
Tell me.
I didn't like you from the start.
An intelligence officer with
an inferiority complex,
fallen to the temptations
of capital.
That story,
doesn't it sound
a bit too fabricated?
Speaking for my Party,
I'll warn you one last time.
If you've got any wrong ideas
about this ad business,
not only you, but those
close to you will suffer.
Superior?
Who's a businessman's superior?
Cash! People with money.
Attention! Divide!
Take off your coat.
When you look at the General,
don't meet his eyes.
Stare at the second button
on his shirt.
Most important,
don't interrupt or contradict him.
Please remember this.
The General will now enter!
Have a seat.
Did I hear you don't drink,
Mr. Park?
Yes, I'm sorry.
I'll pour you a glass instead.
If we achieve reunification,
on that day I'll gladly
accept a drink from you.
That's an audacious answer.
So then,
let's speak with open minds.
The advertising business
that you propose,
how much can it earn
for our Republic?
A down payment of $600,000,
and a total of $5 million
in the contract.
However,
based on your decision,
you could earn much more.
Making decisions isn't hard.
Tell me more.
In order to receive more, we must
accept ads from conglomerates.
So, South Korean products would
be photographed in North Korea.
To do this,
we must scout locations freely
across North Korea.
If we find suitable locations
and shoot advertisements,
over 5 years, we estimate
you can receive $12 million.
However, this is just the beginning.
Mr. Park has developed other
business plans beyond advertising.
General.
Please allow us to open
the bag we have brought.
A plan for a tourist hotel
in Mt. Geumgang.
The hotel and related development
will cost $13 million.
I can raise it.
After that, all profits go
to you and the Republic.
Comrade Ri.
Yes, General.
Sign the deal.
Yes, sir.
It's Koryo celadon.
Discuss it with our side,
then sell it in the South.
Yes, sir.
I'll get you the best price!
TV ads for South Korean products will
soon be shot on North Korean soil.
Recently a local
advertising agency
signed an agreement
with the North,
opening the way for a new era
in North-South exchange.
Our correspondent
from Beijing reports.
The contract for co-produced
advertisements lasts for 5 years,
starting with 4-week shoots in
April, June and September this year.
The Trojan horse is aimed
at North Korea's heart.
Now we just need
to launch the attack.
As a condition of approving
the ad business,
Kim Jong-il wants us to sell
antiquities from Myohyang Museum.
It contains 23,000 pieces
dating back to the 1st century BC.
Appraisers estimate their
total value at $1.5 billion.
So the question is, who will
buy $1.5 billion worth of antiquities?
If we offer a monopoly on
Mt. Geumgang tourism and ads,
I'm sure one of the
conglomerates will agree.
These items here
I'll convert to cash
in South Korea.
As for the rest,
let's sort that out when
the advertiser is fixed.
- Thanks for your help.
- Yes, sir.
Geumgang Restaurant
"Mt. Geumgang is the
spirit of Korea" – Kim Jong-il
Over there!
There!
The North insists that
since IAEA inspections,
the Yongbyon reactor
has remained inactive.
If you can determine clearly
whether the reactor was restarted,
it will be an important clue
about the nuclear program.
For now, we only have permission
to visit tourist sites.
I'll continue with the antiquities,
and search for a way
to access Yongbyon.
Yongbyon 27km
Getting into the Yongbyon facility
is probably impossible.
Prof. Kim Jang-hyuk
contacted us.
If you can make it
within 10km of the reactor,
one of the researchers
will pass over some documents.
We're searching for someone
who can guide you there.
Just wait.
...purged by the Kim regime...
...who could be persuaded
to cooperate.
North Pyongan Province
Guryong Villa
Every Korean wants to see
Mt. Geumgang and Mt. Baekdu,
but after a while they're
no longer so enticing.
I'm just saying for some brands,
they may not want that image.
Then where do
you want to shoot?
First we'll do Baekdu, Geumgang,
Pyongyang and Kaesong in order.
And lastly, we could shoot in
a place like Yongbyon district.
You know the song,
'Azaleas on Yongbyon's Yaksan?'
It's famous in the South, too.
That won't be possible.
Yongbyon is a restricted area.
We can't shoot there.
Sir?
Can I have a word with you?
This is a bit sensitive,
but I met an archaeologist
before coming here.
He said at Guryong River,
about 5km from Yongbyon,
there are a few undiscovered
Goguryeo-era royal tombs.
What's that got to do with me?
Just listen.
Such ancient artifacts are
extremely rare even in the South.
If we open just one tomb,
it could be worth $30 million.
You want to rob graves
on North Korean land?
I just mean...
You know how Director Ri isn't
too keen on the antiquities trade?
So I can't bring it up like this,
but if you agree, perhaps
you could mention it.
To be honest we don't need
to shoot in Yongbyon.
But it's an excuse to go
open some tombs.
In that case,
with your connections,
just ask the General yourself.
Why go through
the back door with me?
Don't be like that.
What if I raise his hopes,
and then we don't find anything?
You think he'd forgive me?
First we check
if they really exist,
and after determining
the locations,
then we report to the General.
This could get you a promotion.
And I'll get my antiquities fee.
You really are a perfect capitalist.
Since we've come this far,
I'll try convincing Director Ri
to visit Guryong River.
No, since I'm in charge
of security issues,
I'll issue an order.
Wow, you're the best!
Decisive, like a soldier!
Much different from Director Ri.
A market near Guryong River,
Yongbyon District
Mr. Park.
Are there really royal tombs here?
Anyway, do a thorough search.
My agents and I have a Party event,
so we can't join you.
From now on, Comrade Ri and
Comrade Kim will go with you.
A mark granted by the Party.
This mark means
all of your tests are finished,
and you're now fully one of us.
We North Koreans are
simple by nature.
Once we start trusting you,
we'll even hand over our pants.
Thank you.
I'll wait for you here,
go with Comrade Kim.
Yes.
Okay, next person.
Keep in line!
- That little brat!
- Grab him!
God damn sticky fingers!
Spare me some mercy.
I found it first!
You little brat. Give it to me!
Don't look.
Keep walking straight.
As you know, the researcher
with a gift for you
is under strict surveillance,
and can't leave the guarded area.
Late at night during the blackout,
I'll come take you there.
Until then, buy time
by looking for tombs.
Mr. Park.
I love my country, too.
But the country I love
is being turned into a jail
by the Kim family.
What the heck are you
talking about?
What's this about a guarded area?
We're not trying to buy time here.
We need to find
those tombs quickly,
so stop wasting time
and let's go!
Mr. Park.
Yes?
Let me introduce you.
Say hello.
Hello sir!
This is Park Suk-young
from South Korea.
He's my son,
and this is my wife.
Nice to meet you!
What a beauty you are!
Wow, how old are you?
You're good-looking!
You take after your mother.
I guess we're all here,
so let's eat.
Is Chief Kim not eating?
Haven't seen him all night.
You won't be seeing him
much anymore.
He'll be concentrating on
Vladivostok trading for now.
Still, leaving without
saying goodbye?
Where is he now?
Mr. Park.
The advertising project
we are running
is the first example
of cooperation between
our people in 40 years.
I don't know under whose orders
Comrade Kim is acting upon,
but this could mean not only
the end of North-South exchange,
but me...
and all the rest of us
are in perilous,
extreme danger right now.
At this stage, I won't refute
that you are a businessman.
The advertising project
will continue without a problem,
so be exceptionally careful
about what you do.
Dec. 1997, Seoul
15 days to presidential election
A month before our infiltration
of Yongbyon, we've hit a snag.
Does Director Ri know who I am?
If he's turning a blind eye,
it means the ad business, approved
by Kim Jong-il, can't be stopped.
It's hard to judge.
As Democratic nominee Kim Dae-jung
maintains his lead in the polls,
Lee Hoi-chang appears to be
chasing right behind him.
Let's look at
the latest poll numbers.
With Kim in front at 32.1%
and Lee in second at 29.8%,
they are separated by only 2.3%,
setting the stage
for a two-man struggle.
Based on Professor Kim's testimony
and the other intelligence
we've gathered,
they sent chemical weapons
to Pakistan
and have already developed
uranium bombs.
The situation is urgent.
So,
what exactly is that
other intelligence anyway?
How long will we rely on
testimony and guesswork?
Bring me facts
based on real evidence.
My apologies.
For now, don't share
the nuclear intel with the CIA.
With no evidence, no need
to stir things up before the election.
This was obtained
by our domestic division.
Plans for Shutdown of NIS
Our fears are slowly
turning into reality.
Kim Dae-jung plans
for new agency
Hak-seong.
If this continues
we're all doomed.
You, me and all the NIS will
be fired by the new government.
Try contacting the North.
There's no time.
I've been trying various routes
to reach them,
but with all HUMINT disbanded...
There's one clear contact.
Black Venus.
We spent so much on him.
Sir.
I have a duty to make
this operation successful.
Orders come first!
Operations second!
An order from who?
From the nation!
The nation, and the people!
Director Choi, please.
First, let's win the election.
Our unit is being destroyed,
we can't just lie in ambush!
Sir.
I just don't understand this.
A letter from the ruling party?
You just pass it on.
The envelope is treated,
so don't open it,
just deliver it as is.
Sir, they think I'm a businessman.
If a businessman passes
on such a letter,
they'll start to suspect
his identity.
It could mean the collapse
of the ad business.
Not necessarily.
Businessmen and politicians
are always close.
The election is in 2 weeks.
You should do your part.
I'll be honest. This letter
reminds me of the general election.
If it's from the ruling party,
of course it'll hurt the opposition.
Then you're willing to let
Kim Dae-jung become president?
You'd let the motherland
fall to the Commies?
No, it's just...
it feels like we're interfering
in the election...
For 37 years, the NIS
has been investigating
Kim Dae-jung.
He's ideologically dangerous!
If he's elected, the North
will dance for joy, right?
Yes.
Our intelligence says
if he's elected, the whole country
could be absorbed by North Korea!
That's even more of a threat
than nuclear weapons, isn't it?
Sir.
It's true the ad business
has its difficulties.
But it's only the beginning.
If it continues for 5 years
without a problem,
we'll not only learn
about nuclear weapons,
but we'll know everything
that's going on there!
- Why all of a sudden...
- Don't argue, just do it!
Major Park...
Thinking is not
something you do yourself.
It's the goals of
the organization.
This time,
follow the organization.
9 days before election Beijing
December 8, 1997.
3 days after giving
the letter to Director Ri,
Ruling party lawmakers set up camp
at the Millennium Hotel,
and are still there
after two days.
Seoul Trading / Executive
Director's father died
I got a sudden order from the
head office to fly home.
Now, I need to find out how
I'm being used for the election.
Hello?
Director Ri!
I'm in front of your room,
can I see you for a moment?
I'm near the hotel,
but I've got an appointment.
I just need to
give you a document.
It's a draft advertisement
from a South Korean company.
You know, the one about
driving to one's hometown?
Sorry but I'll just take the paper
and head to my meeting.
That's fine.
Then I'll wait in the room.
He told me to wait in his room.
What room is he talking about?
Where's Mr. Park?
He's waiting in the room.
I said not to let anyone in.
Stay with him.
Mr. Park.
Mr. Park?
Mr. Park?
What is it?
Where's Director Ri?
We thought you might be lonely.
And we've something to ask.
Oh, really? Have a seat.
Make yourself at home.
Director Ri!
Why's it so hard to meet you?
You're not avoiding me,
are you?
Mr. Park, don't say such things.
I'm busy with Party duties.
Let's have dinner later.
Sure.
Take a look at this draft.
It's the journey of a displaced
old man returning to his hometown.
Bye, now.
Number 64 on the move.
Stand by.
Congressman Park.
Congressman Yoo.
Director Choi, head of
foreign operations at the NIS.
Thanks for meeting us.
We talked it over,
but decided that
a week before the election,
broadcast propaganda or
news conferences about Kim Dae-jung
won't have the effect
we're looking for.
Then what do you want?
Don't we need a military action,
like in the general election?
But this time,
not just firing a few guns.
We need something to
shake the people's confidence.
"Our security comes first,
so I better not vote for Kim."
Something like that.
Election interference. Kim Dae-jung loses.
Then, nuclear weapons
are the only option.
Don't joke at such
an important meeting.
Wait a minute.
Does the North really have
nuclear weapons?
What does it matter?
Until election day,
if the South Korean people
believe we do, isn't that enough?
That's good!
Actually, troop movements in the DMZ
or submarines in the East Sea,
those are getting old.
People are used to it.
That's enough.
This is far above our jurisdiction.
Don't be like that.
The people here are the leading
representatives of North and South.
Just tell us your intentions.
Sorry to interrupt.
Our representatives seem to
have expressed their views.
To let the practical operatives
discuss things, will you excuse us?
All right.
I'll go smoke a cigarette.
I'll be straightforward.
The nuclear issue
is extremely sensitive
for our administration.
If it becomes known
the North developed nukes,
we'll share the blame,
it won't help in the election.
Let's go with a simple strike.
By a strike,
do you mean firing in
the DMZ like last time?
I'm not talking about
the same thing as last time.
The rehearsal's over,
time for the main performance.
On the 5 West Sea islands
along the former truce line,
we'd like a substantive strike
to emulate real war.
Look here.
In everything there are
lines we mustn't cross.
Now the ad business is helping
to warm North-South relations,
but if there's armed provocation
at the truce line,
all North-South relations
will enter a deep freeze.
You need to know restraint.
Sure.
This is frustrating, talking to
a man of different stripes.
Okay.
For the past 40 years, North-South
relations have always been frozen.
The ice is very thick now,
so what's the difference
if it freezes a bit more?
Director Ri.
We're just going to follow
the Party's orders anyway.
Send the proposal
and hear their decision.
Anyway, it's your duty to
pass along our intentions,
so please ask the Party.
To begin with,
for the North's efforts,
this time we'll pay not in flour,
but U.S. dollars.
What a bold movement!
Director Ri.
I'll send a direct request
to the office in Pyongyang.
It's cold outside.
Did you have a good talk?
So...
I spoke with a North Korean
official not long ago.
He said people in the North
don't want Kim Dae-jung either.
A North Korean official?
All of us are here,
what do you mean?
From the Party's point of view too,
dealing with veteran politicians
from the South is not easy.
Plus, governments in the South
have long accused Kim Dae-jung
of being Communist,
North doesn't want Kim Dae-jung?
and I heard many citizens
suspect it too.
So if he's elected,
he may enact stronger anti-Communist
policies to counteract that.
Comrade Jong,
watch your tongue.
That's right.
North Korea needs an enemy
to survive,
but if the pro-North Kim is elected,
you can't criticize him.
And so,
this arrangement benefits
both of us, right?
Comrade Jong!
And besides, Kim Dae-jung is tall,
so our Dear Leader
would have to look up at him.
That would never do.
Jong Moo-taek,
State Security Department.
The Party approved it.
But the Director ordered
State Security to procure
$400,000 of live ammunition.
I'll do as you order, Comrade.
The Party approved it.
Nice work!
Director Choi, great job!
That was excellent!
- Saved by North Korea!
- Yes!
Something this big,
we'll win in a landslide!
- Long live South Korea!
- Hurrah!
- Long live General Kim Jong-il!
- Hurrah!
Sorry, sir.
It's an emergency,
so I crossed the line.
However urgent the situation,
don't you think this is too
dangerous an act for a spy?
Sir.
The North Korean leadership has
gone mad with Communism, right?
An absolute truth!
And Kim Dae-jung must not
be allowed to become president.
Because according to you,
he's a Communist too.
Why keep stating the obvious?
But I hear North Korea doesn't
want Kim Dae-jung elected.
The Communists don't
want a Communist.
Did you wiretap them?
You didn't answer me.
Why are the Communists
against a Communist?
I get how you feel.
You've straddled the capitalist
and Communist camps so long...
Please stop.
You cut off your superior?
You've got some
growing up to do.
If you widen your perspective,
one day you'll understand
what I'm saying.
This thing called politics,
it's hard to grasp with
the logic of ordinary people.
Please stop talking nonsense!
Can't you at least be honest?
The group you're in
always needs an enemy.
And you use that enemy
to scare people
because you want to
maintain your power.
What?!
I'm trying...
to stop Kim Dae-jung
for the sake of the people!
Is working for the people
the same as working for
the ruling party?
Up to now I have put my life
and my family on the line,
in order to answer
the call of my country.
So that I can see
my mission to the end,
please,
support me.
Park Suk-young...
I sent you to infiltrate the Commies.
But I see they infiltrated you.
So...
Major Park.
Black Venus!
You said something once,
looking at the Beijing skyline.
That after its reformation,
China changed in a short time.
After throwing the door open,
China too has
its share of problems.
Still, you at least thought
that it was worth a try?
Director Ri.
The ad business is
not just about money,
but a way to change through
contact with the South...
Isn't that what
you meant back then?
That's right.
You saw it yourself too,
didn't you?
3 million of my countrymen are
dying now of hunger and cold.
Babies who have yet to
take their first step...
just...
throw up blood and die, or...
they're sold for just 10 dollars.
Why do you believe in me?
Because it's
the only choice I have.
But it's all over now.
Troops are already moving.
No.
There's one more thing we can do.
Sir.
The 'business' we pursued,
that word has two meanings.
It means both commerce
and venture.
Sir.
Will you try one last
venture with me?
My South Korean comrades
can't do without me.
Every election they run up here,
asking me to fire artillery,
shoot missiles...
What else can I do?
Got to help my compatriots.
Isn't that right, Mr. Park?
My concern is,
you're not helping them,
but being used by them.
Mr. Park.
What amazes me
about people is...
A few months after birth
they learn to speak,
but decades later they still
haven't learned to keep silent.
Even if it may shorten
their lives.
Thanks for your concern.
Now go.
What I'd like to say is,
if the armed provocation
takes place,
both the advertisements
and the antiquities business
will likely come to an end.
I used to think
you were bright,
but now I see your
analytical skills are lacking.
I grant their request
out of a sense of compatriotism,
so why do you think the
ad business will suffer?
What will happen if the election
doesn't turn out as you expect?
I mean, if Kim Dae-jung is elected
despite the provocation.
General.
Park's words are not
necessarily wrong.
According to data
collected in the South,
there are growing suspicions
among the public
about the events in Panmunjeom
at the last general election.
So if your action
provokes a negative response
and Kim Dae-jung is elected,
the ad business could get
swept away in the backlash,
and the antiquities trade which
funds your policies will crumble.
Come out here!
You're Section Chief Jong?
Colonel Jong Moo-taek, sir!
You must have heard everything.
Tell me your opinion.
If your officially sanctioned
order is reversed,
the South Koreans will
look down on our system.
If anyone disagrees with this,
it's just the slander of
fallen capitalist traitors.
If Chief Jong's words
are spoken out of loyalty,
then he's not wrong.
But I don't believe
everyone at State Security
supports this action
out of loyalty.
What's this now?
You have been told the South will
pay $3.6 million for this action.
However the real amount
offered was $4 million.
Can you guess where
the other $400,000 went?
Someone among our comrades
is joining hands with the South
to beguile me?
Treacherous bastards!
Did you know about this?
We haven't confirmed it yet.
Haven't confirmed it?
So it's possible?
Forgive me! It's...
It's all due to our negligence.
Thanks to your great decisions,
you have gained much recently.
Ads and tourism,
reunions of separated families.
Profits and promotion
of our nation's scenery.
Most of all, you've been able
to show the entire world
your decisiveness and magnanimity
in bringing reconciliation.
But General,
if you order military action before
the election, all this is lost.
For a mere $4 million, will you lose
benefits worth 100 times more?
Hey, Ri Myong-un!
This is a national disgrace!
This armed action
along the truce line,
do a full investigation and
root out all reactionaries!
I'll do as you order, sir!
All deals with Southern politicians,
including the military action,
are on hold.
Anyway, we've already shown
we can affect elections
in the South if we want to.
Panmunjeom JSA Post 1, all clear.
3 days before election
NIS Security Room
No, we haven't detected anything
unusual on the Northern side.
Hey, did you check properly?
I told you to watch units from
the truce line to the 38th parallel!
Sir.
I checked on the target,
but he took an Air Koryo flight
from Beijing to Pyongyang.
What?
Bastard...
That bastard!
Kim Dae-jung is leading in Gwangju,
Daejeon and Gyeonggi Province,
while Lee Hoi-chang leads in Ulsan.
That's how the votes by region
stand at the present moment.
We'll provide more updates
as they come in.
Who will the next president be?
Elected
First Change of Party in 50 Years
For the first time in South Korea's
50-year history,
the ruling and opposition parties
are switching places.
After promising to become
the foreign policy president,
Kim plans a new effort for
the peaceful reunification of Korea.
Dear respected citizens,
I sincerely thank you.
The whole world has
watched our election,
to see what choice the crisis-struck
Korean people would make.
I will appoint
new envoys to the North,
and propose restarting negotiations
on the Inter-Korean Basic Agreement.
And if viable,
I will propose a summit
meeting with Kim Jong-il.
My dear and respected citizens,
I promise to devote myself
to opening a great new era
for the Republic of Korea.
Hello!
Welcome.
For a long time I've wanted
to give you a gift.
It's quite humble,
but if you don't dislike it,
please accept it.
A man of audacious spirit
After you go back,
when can I see you again?
We'll meet often
for the ads, I'm sure.
What could change?
Do you want a drink?
Sure, why not?
To the ad business
that will change Korea.
Cheers!
About the strike
on the 5 islands.
Apart from us,
who knows about it?
Including the three of us here,
and Congressman Yoo
who went with us.
A total of 5.
Who's the other person?
A black agent of ours
working in Beijing.
He wiretapped Northern officials,
and heard by accident.
Can he be trusted?
It's not certain.
Keep him quiet somehow.
That's our only path to survival.
Delete any mention of NK nukes,
since it'll trouble the President.
Emphasize in particular
the trips to the North
he took alone without our orders.
So we can use the
National Security Law.
The National Security Law?
The sponsor of the
North Korean ads is S?
Yes, that's right.
In that case,
make it look like a tip-off
from a competitor.
...meeting Kim Jong-il
without NIS approval..."
Like a rival company
with a grudge against
the ad business.
Delivery!
Report on International Spying
The spy Black Venus who is
named most in the leaked report
is said to be an advertising
executive named Park.
He recently visited
North Korea in secret
and handed over
military secrets to the North.
His importance to the North
can be seen in that he even had
private meetings with Kim Jong-il.
Director Ri!
Leaked Report on NIS Spies
Black Venus.
Do you realize what this means?
A spy deceived us,
and met the head of our nation.
It changes nothing.
Changes nothing?
You're so simple.
I warned you, didn't I?
I'll explain everything.
Don't bother.
You and I were just working
for the sake of our countries.
It's nothing personal.
Convert.
Then I'll guarantee
the safety of you
and your family.
Just as you have
only one motherland,
so do I.
Please protect my family.
South Korea is such
an interesting country.
How could an intelligence service
leak intel on its own agents?
However much I try,
I can't figure it out.
The Party doesn't know yet.
But it will take an hour at most.
With this ID,
no one will stop you
from leaving Pyongyang.
Then cross the border
as soon as possible.
Then what will happen to you?
I studied capitalist economics,
and am the only one who can oversee
foreign currency earning.
So...
surely they wouldn't kill me?
Go!
ID check.
ID check.
Let's see your ID.
Identity certified by Kim Jong-il
RIM Chol-jun
My apologies, sir.
Good evening!
ID check.
I hope we can meet again.
The promise we made
to each other
I'll keep, no matter what.
If we're fated to meet again,
then someday it will happen.
After that day,
no one in Beijing
ever saw anyone
in Ri's circle again.
Comrade Ri Myong-un!
The Party summons you.
Three years ago in this place,
I first met Director Ri.
This man who said North Korea
needed to change, too.
Can he ever return here?
I don't even know if
his family is alive.
The prosecutor's office has
assembled a special team
to investigate the "Northern Wind"
case from the last election.
As the 1996 military action
in the DMZ
is also suspected as a case
of electoral interference,
key members of the
previous administration
are falling under suspicion.
Internal investigations
at the NIS
suggest election meddling
was centered
in the foreign operations team
headed by Director 'L'.
The reunions of separated
family members resumed,
and the NIS was re-organized
into a new entity.
Why did I become a spy?
What have I been fighting for
all this time?
Five years later, 2005
Shooting studio, Shanghai
For the first time
a North Korean woman
will model in an advert
for a South Korean company.
Attention is focusing on
whether this project
can serve as an impetus to thaw
the recent chill in
North-South relations.
Look, it's Lee Hyori.
She looks smaller
than on camera, right?
I should have said hi
to her before the shooting.
Come on, don't be silly.
It took us
10 years to get here.
How are you feeling
at this moment?
Did you know about Jo Myong-ae before?
Please say a word as you became
a model representing South Korea!
Hyori!
Hyori...
This is Jo Myong-ae
from the North.
And this is Lee Hyori
from the South.
Say hello.
Hello.
How old are you?
I was born in 1980.
Then think of me
as an older sister.
Was it difficult getting here?
It was fine.
Shake her hand, like this.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
In June 2010, Black Venus was arrested under
violation of the National Security Law
for doing business with North Korea.
He was charged with virtually all offenses
in the National Security Law,
including espionage, border crossing,
corresponding with the enemy, etc.
He was released in May, 2016
after serving 6 years in prison.
And two years later in May 2018,
Korea is facing another phase
after the first summit in 11 years
between the South and the North.
