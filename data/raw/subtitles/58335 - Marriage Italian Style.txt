MARRIAGE ITALIAN STYLE
- What happens?
- Someone is wounded!
- We must be quick!
- Let me do it.
Gently, gently!
- Who is she?
- Donna Filumena.
Holy Mary, she looks pale.
What happened?
At the bakery she suddenly got sick.
She hasn't been the same lately...
She hasn't eaten in 15 days,
poor her.
- Holy Mary, Donna Filumena.
- She is ill.
Donna Filumena
what happened? How are you?
At the bakery.
I felt that it was going to happen!
Carry her on, gently.
Gently, gently.
A doctor, a doctor.
Alfredo?
Alfredo!
What's happening?
Mamma mia.
Rush to call Don Domenico
and a doctor.
- How? I haven't got it.
- Take a taxi! Go!
Gently, don't hurt her.
Afterwards bring me back the armchair.
You think of your armchair!
I knew it, I knew it.
Gently.
Her hands are cold, poor woman.
What is Don Domenico
going to say?
- I didn't think of it.
- It will be bad for him.
- To the till!
- Just a second!
This is fine on the red jacket.
In Paris you will look like a queen.
Diana, let us see you!
- There is a problem.
- A problem? What problem?
There is a problem.
Next Saturday, at the altar...
... this sweet bride has to...
... look like a Madonna.
Lawyer, I'm going to give
only 200 million in cash.
What about the 10 million from the bill?
- Where is Don Domenico?
- Back there, in the "atelier"!
Can I?
- The bride dress?
- 180,000.
- Both hats?
- 60,000 lire.
- Don Domenico.
- What do you want?
Donna Filumena is sick!
Take her home and call a doctor.
I did it, but she does not talk.
- Then she must be really bad.
- She is suffering!
Alfredo, I have got important stuff
to do and...
Don Domenico it's true!
He never leaves me in peace!
Lawyer, I'm going out for a moment.
You keep talking to these Signori.
This shop, the two cake shops
and the bakery of Via Forcella...
I want to sell them all together,
because I get married...
and I move to Rome.
See you later.
Ciao!
I am somewhat perplexed.
If you agree, I'd like to have a second opinion.
Do whatever you need.
I thought of Professor Brinati
from university.
But he teaches in the morning.
He could come in the afternoon.
Given the state of the patient
till the afternoon...
Is it that bad?
Well...
Oh, Jesus!
What do we do?
There is Professor Carrocci.
Don't worry, I'll think about it.
Anything! Cost is not a problem!
Don't worry now.
Go to visit the patient.
You can go.
Don Domenico doesn't look good,
he needs a coffee.
Right away.
Don Domenico!
Go back to the bakery!
Ah, a coffee!
Domenico...
Filumena, what happened to you?
Now a professor comes...
we'll have a consultation and you'll get better.
- No, no.
- Don't say that.
You'll get better.
No, not a doctor,
a priest.
How is she?
- She wants a priest.
- A priest!
Run to the parish of
San Cipriano!
Ask of Don Alfonso.
He was her confessor!
The doctor told me to bring you a coffee...
Because you also don't look right.
- Is there sugar?
- Two spoons.
Donna Filumena is she so ill?
Is it possible that it always
starts as I take my pants off?!
I'm going away!
- Calm down, it's just the alarm!
- These are bombs!
It takes 15 minutes before bombing!
Alarm!
You've been there for an hour, pay!
- I didn't consume!
- In an hour?
In three minutes we could all be dead!
Don't come here any more,
do you understand?
Once again:
Hooray for Tower of Pisa, hanging... 
This love beat makes my heart trembling. 
How can we win a war
with people dressed like this?
Light!
My love is far away. 
- Filumena, don't you come down?
- No, no.
Why not?! Come down,
I take you to the shelter.
No, there are people there.
Because you see people?!
Here it's dangerous.
The harbour is a military objective.
We could be hit there.
- I wish!
- What?
- Are you leaving?
- But...
- I am scared.
- Then come down!
- There are people. I am embarrassed.
- Damn!
How long have you been here?
Three days.
- How old are you?
- 17.
- Oh no.
- I am scared.
I am scared.
I am scared.
Mamma mia, how scared.
- Mamma mia, how scared!
- Girl...
- Are you going?
- Staying here it's madness.
I want to die.
So you make me die too!
- What is your name?
- Filumena.
- Come on Filumena.
- No, no.
What are you doing, idiot?
Are you afraid of "police"?!
You bastard!
Assunta!
Don Domenico!
Ah! You know me.
Filumena.
Filumena?
Don't you remember me?
The house... Fantasy Alley...
two years ago.
The alarm was on.
Ah! Yes, yes.
You did not come back!
You were right.
It was only tears and sighs there.
How much are eggs?
Alfredo, you get on the bus.
The lady comes with me to Naples by car.
- Okay?
- Sure!
One moment!
- Let's go!
- I have to get off!
Get off the window!
Wait, I help you.
What are you looking at?
It's all fresh stuff!
You like the scenery?
- Just a moment!
- We help him as well!
Do you have relatives in San Sebastiano? - No.
Where are you staying now?
Still there. I have the best room now.
- Don't you have a garter?
- I've got...
Suspenders... .
It's more fashionable.
- Don't you like it?
- Yes.
This rain is a real bother!
It must be a bombed castle.
Let's go to see it.
Anybody here?
Anybody here?
Filumena, come!
What do you want to do?
There is no-one here.
Anybody here?
Come, come.
The maid is unpleasant.
- Why do you want to kick her out?
- Just a whim...
A whim...
Hi!
Hi!
Maybe it is the wrong castle.
You have your new car!
How shiny!
- Best wishes Don Domenico.
- Thanks.
Can I?
Filumena, how are you dressed?
Don't you like it?
Yes, but...
Shoes are a gift of yours.
Yes, but your dress... my new car...
I wanted to take you to Agnano's
Race course.
I see.
- Were you offended?
- No.
You told me the nicest thing...
You said you wanted to take me along
with you and show me to everybody...
Like a lady.
Come with me!
No Filumena.
I don't know what to wear.
Come.
- Come along!
- Okay.
What do you say, a full dress
or coordinated?
You decide.
No eh?
- This one?
- Oh mamma mia!
- It's all laces.
- I don't like it.
- This one!
- It is an underskirt!
Filumena!
It is easier to get your clothes off...
Than to get them on!
I have a cute jacket.
- This one!
- Okay.
- But it doesn't go with a corset.
- Take it off.
- Turn around.
- Filumena!
Turn around.
- You looked.
- Imagine that!
What do you want to do?
And the trip to Agnano?
Is it possible that after all these years
you are still shy of me?
- How should I call you?
- I don't know... Domenico, Mimì.
Okay, Don Domenico.
- Domenico.
- Yes!
- Goodbye!
- Where are you going?
He's taking me to eat out
and then to Agnano.
There we'll meet important people,
friends of his.
Good-bye. See you tonight!
There's nobody here.
You have taken me on a day
when nobody is here.
On Tuesday there are no races.
Agnano is better, more poetic.
- Come Filumena.
- But it is empty.
Come to have a look.
Come!
Look what beautiful scenery!
Mamma mia!
What a view we have from up here!
Marquise Bassano sits always
two steps below...
With a telescope this long!
What are you doing?
To be truly happy...
I would like my bedroom right here.
There is a cricket in the grass.
Yes.
What a nice child!
Do you like children, Domenico?
Domenico!
Munasterio 'e Santa Chiara... 
tengo 'o core scuro scuro... 
pecchè ogne sera penzo a Napule comm'era... 
What's up Filumena?
You got sad.
You aren't taking me to the Royal Palace, are you?
Right.
What a way you have to love me!
How can you live thinking that
I am...
Up there at everybody's disposal?!
In the beginning I tormented myself,
it was sick really.
You always said to me:
"What do other people matter
compared to you?
You're my man, others don't count. "
I was 17 then.
At that age I could not understand.
Now it's different.
I became a woman with you.
Filumena, why do you want to spoil
our evening?
You have a place and
I always gave you my support.
It's true, I travel.
Then I'm back... and who do I return to?
At least if you did not return
I would give you up forever.
That's it, the end.
But no!
When I resigned to the idea...
After six months, one year...
You come back...
and we start all over again.
I want to be there no more, Domenico!
No more.
What's my home?
Where is it Domenico?
Domenico...
Domenico!
Domenico!
- Are you crazy?
- Yes, I am crazy!
I am crazy!
I am crazy!
- It is beautiful!
- Come.
Who is she?
Tomorrow they take everything away.
- Who is this?
- It's me.
This is the hall...
This is the dining room.
- Shall I open the shutters?
- Yes.
Beh!
Close your eyes.
Look.
Domenico!
- You know who got married?
- Who?
A friend of mine, the one from Genoa.
Really?
Come, you are at home.
Come in!
The contract is in your name.
Come!
Then there is kitchen and bathroom.
- This?
- It's the dining room.
No, she!
She was working for the past tenant.
A woman can be useful.
Check her out.
What is your name?
Rosalia Solimeno,
daughter of Sofia Trombetta, cleaner.
And Giulilano Solimeno,
blacksmith, Madam.
Madam!
- Be here tomorrow morning.
- Thank you, your excellency.
Master of the house!
- Where's the contract?
- Here it is.
- Can I sit down?
- Please.
Filumena Marturano
or Marturano Filumena?
As you like.
Fi...
lu...
m...
Mamma mia!
me...
na.
That's done.
Done!
Mar...
tu...
ra...
Damn. The "n" is too big!
no...
Jesus.
My signature doesn't look nice,
but it's mine.
- How much is rent?
- On the contract...
it says 3,000 Lire,
but between us it is just a kiss.
It's too little.
Raise the rent or I'm leaving.
Good night, Alfredo.
Good night, Don Domenico
and Donna Filumena.
Domenico, it has never been
so good. Right?
Yes, but now I must go.
It's late.
- Turn the light on.
- No.
Stay here to sleep with me,
like newlyweds!
Basta ca ce sta 'o sole,
basta ca ce sta 'o mare... 
Via San Potito, 29. Flat 6.
Report of available accommodation...
Due to tenant's decease Amalia
Starita.
- Is it here?
- No.
Yes. Let him in.
Oh, Jesus!
When did this lady Starita die?
Two days ago.
We requisition the flat to assign it to...
You requisition nothing.
- Who are you?
- The owner, Domenico Soriano.
Do you live here?
No, I am passing by.
- The accommodation...
- San Potito Bar!
Take it there. The accommodation
is taken by Miss Marturano...
Who, for six months,
as you can see on the contract...
has been paying rent...
waiting for the painful event
to happen.
- And it happened.
- I see.
For six months you have collected
rent from the dead and the alive.
It was a mistake!
The apartment is already taken.
You can thank Miss, good-bye.
You left me a mark.
I ought to go to a barber for
some cream.
Come and have a coffee.
- Domenico, do you want a lift?
- Thanks, Fofò. I have mine.
Something to declare?
Perfumes, cigarettes?
One carton.
Let's have a look at this.
- It's mine!
- Open it, please.
Please.
What's this?
As you can see, mostly art nudes.
When you go to Paris,
you find this stuff in your suitcase...
Without knowing how it got there.
Where do yo buy them?
Tomorrow morning have the
shop cleaned...
And the toilet, it is disgusting!
Tell your boys
not to crash bottles.
People complained that returned
empties are broken.
- Don't forget.
- Yes, goodnight.
Filumena!
You are back!
I've been watching for a quarter of an hour.
Don't you recognize me?
Look at what I bought in London.
35,000 Lire, handmade.
They are called "Borrow".
At night, with the moon,
you put them out of the window.
After a month, you have a corn...
the so called "Borrow corn".
Where are you going?
I've got the car.
You come back after four months
and you talk to me about shoes.
Let's have a walk, I have to talk to you.
There is a young man
who would like to marry me.
Marry you?
Yes, it does not seem possible to you?
Yes.
Who is he?
He knows everything about me,
who I was and who I was not.
Domenico, I love you.
I've always loved you,
since that night.
But you never loved me.
I knew it!
You get back at me because sometimes I leave you on your own.
Do I have to be confined to Naples?
It is your fault, Filumena.
If you did not take
care of all my business...
I would be forced to stay.
Don't I love you?
If I did not love you...
I would not have taken you out of that place...
I would not have given you a house...
I would not have placed you in my shops.
I would not take you at home,
to my mother.
- To your mother?
- Yes, she wants to know you.
Come.
Mamma, can I?
Mamma?
I brought you Filumena.
Let us see you.
Dear, Filumena!
She is Carmela's niece.
Yes mamma, as you like,
she is Carmela's niece.
Don't worry.
She has a cough attack...
But luckily it goes away quickly.
Come.
I show you the room where...
This is my room, close by.
Who is this Carmela and
why am I her niece?
No, nothing.
Carmela has been
my mom's waitress for years.
Then she went to America to her children...
and she promised my mother
to send her niece.
So my mom always asks...
"This niece, when is she coming".
You know old people.
She is still bright...
but she has her fixations.
poor Mom.
I understand.
This was Carmela's room.
Yes, it was hers.
The house is big,
but bedrooms are just two.
- My Mom's and mine.
- There's a kitchen.
Yes, halls, sitting-rooms...
All useless stuff, like they
use to build. Old houses!
I also bring Rosalia.
The house is big...
And your mother must be served thoroughly.
Of course!
Now you are the master here.
- But I sleep in the maid's room.
- You're unfair!
Your real bedroom is mine.
At night you get out quietly...
- Walk along the corridor and...
- I find your room empty.
Because who knows where you are.
It is not true.
Carmela!
Filumena! Carmela!
Carmela! Carmela!
- What is it?
- What is it, Donna Matilda?
The crib! The crib!
The woman with chicken
goes behind the "mue".
Behind the "mue"!
The woman with chicken
goes behind the "mue".
- Behind the "mue"!
- Behind the wall.
Behind the "mue"!
- What's she saying?
- Behind the mule.
Ah, behind the mule!
Domenico has spent a year
in Santo Stefano Rotondo.
- Santo Stefano of Paris.
- To Padre Pio! - With the whores.
Did the priest come for blessing?
He comes at Easter, Mamma,
- Now it's Christmas.
- He doesn't come then?
- He comes at Easter!
- Too bad!
- I want to pee.
- Yes.
The bedpan.
It's under that furniture,
behind the screen.
Damn!
- Bedpan!
- Eh!
What a nice lady your mother was!
Be brave, Don Domenico.
She use to pick you up at school
with her nice Florentine straw hat.
- How beautiful she was!
- How beautiful she was!
Madam Cuccurullo!
- Domenico!
- She absolutely had to get up!
Poor Matilde!
I feel bad...
What's the problem?
Madam Cuccurullo!
Madam Cuccurullo!
A coffee!
Madam Cuccurullo is sick!
- Do you know this "Cuccurullo"?
- I have never seen her.
A moment.
No, no Filumena.
Do you want to show up
in an occasion such as this?
Miss, an offering for Madonna!
- Hello Donna Filumena.
- Where is he?
At the back, as always.
Till!!
Filumena!
Good!
You have brought Easter eggs.
Yes.
With a surprise!
Father?
Is she really at the end?
When is the doctor coming
for consultation?
My son...
My son be honest,
do you love that woman?
We have been together for many years.
You know it.
I know it all.
Domenico, come!
Alfredo, here.
Quiet!
Do you want, Domenico Soriano,
to take as your bride...
Filumena Marturano...
According to the rite of the
Holy Roman Church?
Yes.
And do you, Filumena Marturano,
want to take as legitimate husband...
Domenico Soriano...
According to the rite of the
Holy Roman Church?
Yes.
Alfredo!
I declare you husband and wife.
Don Alfonso, adjust your hair.
You go over there and you come here.
Take it, eat it.
Good, my son.
You have done some charity.
There will be one more soul in heaven.
Thanks!
- Hello? Diana, is that you?
- Yes, dear!
- Have you finished?
- Yes, I have almost finished.
- Did they make the deal?
- It looks like.
They wait for you at the lawyer's...
200 million in cash and the rest
in promissory notes.
Then...
The typography...
Asked me for the invitation text.
It's urgent, Domenico.
Eventually, friends will receive it
after the wedding.
Nothing is changing.
I don't know, maybe in a while.
Yes. The poor woman is dying.
Domenico, I am here!
The poor woman is alive.
The Madonna made me a favour!
We are husband and wife!
The Signora has resurrected!
- Filumena!
- What do you want?
- A deception! How could you?
- Think about what you could not do.
I allowed you to change the cashier
one, two, three times.
The first time I let it pass:
"Filumena, you must rest. "
And I rested.
The second one went away by herself.
And the third one you wanted to marry her!
You knew it all!
Out of my house!
Out!
You go off too!
I am in my house.
Not even policemen can take me away!
You were a wretched woman
and you still are.
- You're talking of your wife.
- What wife?
Yours! Mrs. Soriano!
I!
I kill you and give you three cents.
A woman like you
is only worth three cents!
These two lousy guys helped you!
- I kill you all!
- It's a slaughter!
Where is my gun?
Our Lady of Carmelo!
In the drawer.
Watch your freshly ironed shirts!
Idiot! Idiot!
You are idiot and disgusting!
- Oh mamma mia!
- Mamma mia!
Holy Madonna!
Don Domenico, what have you done?
Go away! It hurts!
My knee! My heart!
My heart...
He's there.
Who?
Don Domenico is having a heart attack!
He is dying!
He doesn't die!
Those who have no heart cannot
have a heart attack!
Are you statues?
- Move!
- Girls, hurry up! Put some zeal!
- Are you a lawyer?
- No.
What do you do?
Let's go.
Quickly.
- Filumena, they want you on the phone.
- Me?
Hello?
From San Sebastiano of Vesuvius?
Run! Run!
Damn! Which is the road?
I've always taken the bus.
Ah, the bus!
Like that time we met you.
Do you know anybody here?
Alfredo, be quiet.
Annunziata?
How is he?
Annunziata, Signora is here!
Signora!
- Annunziata, how is he?
- Asleep.
Is he sleeping?
Michele, Michelino.
He is awake.
Now he is good, but last night. .
He was feverish!
I lost my mind.
I said to my husband:
"My God if an accident happens...
What are we going to say to Signora?
Go to call her!"
My husband said:
"This late?"
"This late you wake up the operator. "
You have done well.
Up Michele, Michelino.
Don't you want to come?
He wants me.
Come here, Michelino.
Come here! Give him to me.
My Michelino!
But how did it happen?
- Has the doctor seen him?
- Yes, doctor has seen him.
He asked immediately:
"what did this child eat?"
"A kilogram of cherries with nuts. "
- With nuts?
- Yes.
He pumped his stomach
and gave him a purge.
- What happens?
- The purge!
Come on, Mum's sweetheart!
The nuts!
How sweet you are!
Nuts!
Don Domenico has to know nothing about it.
Neither about the car nor other things.
Do you understand?
- Do you understand, Alfredo?
- Yes.
No. You say: "I do understand".
I do understand.
The child was really nice!
Four woollen shirts, three underpants...
And socks.
How cute is the mother
with her baby in her arms!
How cute.
What happened?
Filumena. I...
I marry both of you.
I marry you even with a child.
Alfredo, let's go, it's late.
Sorry!
Alfredo, I have another two.
Stop it!
Another two?
Let's give them some pastries.
Are you crazy?! There is rum!
Hello, Madam.
Riccardo!
Umberto!
Can we get the pastries
like last time?
Don't eat too many.
Eat.
Don't get dirty
otherwise the nuns get upset.
Pastries are eaten with just a bite!
Be careful or you get a stomach ache!
Donna Filumena, I marry all three of you. Damn!
I marry all three together.
Alfredo, they are all important to me.
You see the two boys?
You cannot do for them
what does without knowing...
Domenico Soriano.
- You can't get up!
- I am OK!
- Go away!
- Oh mamma mia!
- Go away.
- No!
Go, Rosalia.
Only a woman like you
could get that far.
You had to be consistent.
The last 22 years
could not change you.
But I report you, I report you all!
You, the doctor, the priest...
When I say where I found you,
I will prove...
I was right.
I'll ruin you, Filumena!
Oh God!
Sit down.
Have you finished?
Firstly! Where you found me?
Is that new?!
But you were coming where I was,
weren't you?
Secondly. The doctor and the priest
knew nothing.
They believed it. They had to.
Because after 22 years with you
any woman would end up like this.
For 22 years I have been your maid.
I run the cake shops and the bakery.
I run the house better than a wife.
I washed your mother's
feet and yours...
And not now that I am 40,
but when I was younger.
Always like a servant you
can kick out at any time.
I have never seen subdued...
And understanding
of our true situation.
Always with a boastful face!
I have never seen a tear
in your eyes.
All these years
I have never seen you crying.
Should I cry for you?
You would have liked that!
Domenico, do you know when you cry?
When you know what's good
and you can't have it.
I do not know what's good.
I never had that satisfaction
for crying.
You always treated me
like the very last woman.
Yes Sir, when does someone finish
paying for his own sins?
At 50 you come back...
With your hankies lipstick dirty!
Where are they?
- I kept them.
- Good.
You don't even try
to be careful.
What's the matter if Filumena finds them?!
She has no right!
In one month now you fell
for that bitch!
A 50 years old man with an
girl of 20!
What does it matter to you
if she is 20 or 22?
Nothing!
I do not care about you any more.
Now I need you and that's it.
After 22 years you thought that
I would go with nothing?
Ah, money!
That's the real reason,
money!
Wouldn't I have given it to you
without such acting?
Only money exists for you.
Money.
I want something else from you.
And you'll give it to me.
I have three children.
What are you saying?
- Three children?
- Yes.
- You knew it?
- Yes.
Good, go!
- Whose children are they?
- Of men like you.
Filumena, what do you mean?
You were all the same for me.
The eldest is 20 in May.
He studies.
The second...
Don't pull
that face, they are not your children!
Do they know you?
What do they do?
How do they survive?
- How did you raise them?
- With your money.
I robbed you for years.
I raised them with your money.
They are not known to me and...
They may also laugh at me!
- They don't even know you exist!
- I paid and that's it.
Should have I killed them?
That was my friend's advice.
"Are you crazy? You
would forget it all. "
Nobody had a nice word for me...
Or gave me a hand to help.
I had to find an answer
on my own.
Alone!
Now they are big.
Donna Filumena, you are a saint!
Rosalia go to cry back there.
You are a devil, not a saint!
You are a lousy woodworm,
where you lay, you destroy!
If you do not want money,
what do you want from me?
I am tired of hiding,
of looking at them from far away.
I want them to know me
and love me!
I need it, Domenico.
Now that they're big...
I don't want them to be sad
as they pull out an ID.
They must have a name,
they must have mine!
- What?
- Soriano!
I knew it,
but I wanted to hear it from you.
Those three strangers in my house?
On my dead body! I will never happen.
- I swear!
- Don't swear!
For a given oath I've been
begging for 22 years.
- If one day you need me?
- What are you saying?
She wanted to give my name...
- To her sons, those sons...
- Of what?
Of a bitch!
You damned, I even lost my voice!
He woke up!
Good morning Don Domenico.
Did you sleep well?
Why are you like that?
What's happening now?
We are doing the cleaning.
In fact, if I may...
- What are you doing?
- I take the bedside table.
Where do you take it?
Donna Filumena ordered...
What? Alfredo come here!
What happens?
Take the new sheets tied with
a red ribbon.
Yes!
Jackets in the wardrobe and
winter clothes in the bag.
Shoes in the cupboard behind the screen.
The cupboard behind the screen?
Mommy's room!
This is Mrs. Soriano's room.
You wretch! You're crazy!
Mamma, Mamma.
Domenico, I no longer sleep
in the servant's room!
- Put everything back in order!
- No!
Everything as it was before!
- What ward is this?
- It's for my children.
It doesn't matter if it's tight.
I call my lawyer
and let's see how it ends!
As far as I'm concerned you can
call the Holy Father.
I'll let the police kick you out!
You too out!
I send you back where I found you.
It is closed now.
According to Articles 101, 110, 121
and 122...
Your position is false.
Is it clear?
I don't get along with the law.
We got that.
From a legal point of view
even without knowing...
You have committed a fraud.
Article 101:
"Marriage in imminent danger of life. "
"In case of danger of life... "
It then explains how.
But there was no danger of life.
It was - my dear - fiction.
There are witnesses:
Alfredo, Lucia, Rosalia.
As soon as the priest left,
she got up and said to me:
"We are husband and wife!"
This is now Article 122:
"Force and error".
"A marriage may be challenged
by one of the two weds...
whose consent was extorted
with force...
or excluded as a result of an error".
I didn't understand a thing.
Filumena, I married you because
you had to die!
A marriage cannot have conditions.
You didn't understand either!
Please explain.
This is the Article.
You can read it yourself.
I can't read.
Since you were not about to die...
Marriage is null. It doesn't count.
- And the priest?
- He'll say the same.
You even offended a sacrament.
It doesn't count!
- It doesn't count. Did I have to die?
- Yes.
- If I were dead...
- It would have been valid.
Oh! Is this justice?
The Law cannot support
your principle, although human.
She would become an accomplice
of a fraud.
Furthermore Don Domenico doesn't
want to join in marriage with you.
Did you understand now?
No.
But I believe it, it must be true
and do you know why?
You are calm now.
Your boss look is back.
Lawyer, proceed!
I don't want you either.
Yes lawyer, proceed.
I don't want it either!
It wasn't true I was about to die.
I wanted to make a fraud.
I wanted to steal a family name.
But I knew only my own law,
the one that makes you laugh,
Not the one that makes you cry.
Alfredo, come here!
Call all three now!
- All three?
- Yes.
Two are here already,
the youngest, the mechanic, not yet.
Help me, my hands are shaking.
For years I've been waiting for this
and now I am afraid.
- Of what?
- What do I say? How?
- What are they going to say?
- They will say:
Thanks mamma, for all your sacrifices.
Put some lipstick on instead.
No.
You look pale!
I want to look like a mother.
Here it is. The lady is coming.
Meanwhile, there is some dessert.
I brought them some dessert.
I must have seen you somewhere.
Have you attended Nazareth Institute?
No, S. Anthony of Palm Institute.
- Are they Ursuline?
- No.
Come, take a pastry as well.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Do you have a match?
- No.
And you?
"You"? Do I know you?!
Let me introduce myself.
Michele Esposito.
How are you, Esposito.
I, Degli Espositi.
What a beautiful gallery of ancestors!
All, Esposito...
You too have received this ticket?
Yes, we too.
Just a moment.
- Who is this Filumena Marturano?
- She is a...
- Not true!
- Everyone knows that. She's famous.
She lives in Italy now,
but before...
- What does she want from us?
- I don't know, it is a riddle!
How many cigarettes do you smoke per day?
4 or 5.
- How old are you?
- 15.
It will only take a minute,
please come in.
Miss.
If we want to end this tale...
The lawyer has all papers ready.
Let's go in the study.
Did you change your mind?
Who is there?
Stay back, go in the office,
I'm coming.
Don't you worry. I'll sign everything.
I've already packed
my bags, right? - Yes.
I let you free, but I don't forego
my children. Go!
- Why?
- Leave me alone!
Who are you to prevent me
to tell them I'm their mother?
The law allows me, right?
Don't worry about me, I am strong.
I'm not crying, look!
- Go in the study, I'm coming.
- You are crazy!
Yes, it's me.
It's really me, Michele.
That crazy one who always comes
to the petrol station with an excuse.
You know me too.
Right, Riccardo?
To buy a pair of gloves...
I get the shop upside down.
- Instead you have never seen me.
- No.
Yet I often ate with you.
Where?
At your restaurant, by the hospital.
You at the table by the window
and I in front of it.
But you are always distracted,
you study even as you eat!
It's not a riddle
as Michele said.
It's a big drama...
Because...
You are my children!
What are you doing?
Alfredo, go to have the car cleaned!
Do you know the "slams"?
At Forcella, Tribunali...
Black, smoky...
Where in the summer one hardly breathes.
Where there is no light even
at midday.
I lived in one of those districts
with my family.
We were lots! I don't know what
happened to my family.
I don't want to know.
Always with a grumpy face,
always quarrelling.
We went to sleep and woke up
without saying a word.
And the heat!
In the evening, at dinner, there was
only a large dish and many forks.
Only once my father
showed some interest in me.
When I think about it, I tremble.
I was 16.
He said:
"Now you're a grown up
and here there is no food. "
Sixteen!
Young ladies walked pass
with nice shoes.
And I looked.
Passing along with their boyfriends.
There was a guy
who sometimes helped me.
A baker...
He gave loafs, fresh bread...
In winter the oven was a relief.
But my father was right,
I was a grown up then.
Even the baker noticed it.
One day I met a friend of mine.
I almost didn't recognize her
she was that elegant.
Perhaps then
anything looked nice to me.
She said:
"So... so... so and so. "
Forgive me!
Maybe for you nothing was better
rather than a mother like this.
True?
Isn't it true?
Then come here and give me a kiss!
- My hands are dirty.
- It doesn't matter!
Sorry, I did not know that a lady
would eavesdropping.
Riccardo!
- Where are you going?
- Let him go, he is like that.
- Riccardo, are you leaving?
- What are you doing?
- Where are you going?
- Riccardo!
Have they left?
- A second.
- Do we want to spend the night here?
Do we want to stop this comedy
at my place?
Let's go out. What are we doing
here on such a lovely day.
Wait for me down below. I sort
one thing out with the landlord.
Here I am. Where is the lawyer?
He left. I could not keep him
all day for you.
But his papers are here and
here it's a pen.
- Shall I read you the document?
- No, no.
Here are the house and
the cupboards keys.
Tomorrow I send for my stuff.
- Do I have to sign?
- Yes.
You are crazy!
You could have taken some money
without all this fuss.
You wanted to ruin those kids' peace.
Why did you tell them?
One of them is your son.
- I don't believe you!
- One of them is your son.
Be quiet!
I could have said that
they were all your children.
You would have believe it.
But only one is your son.
That's not true. It can't be true.
You would have told me that
to keep me tied up.
You tied up?
You would have asked me to kill him.
Thanks to me your son is alive.
Which one?
I don't remember,
for me they are all equal.
Donna Filumena, come to have a look.
Down below Riccardo is waiting
for you too.
I knew it.
Which one?
See, they are all equal.
- They must be all equal.
- Of course, they are your children!
I don't know them and I don't want
to know them. Go away!
I go away, rest in peace.
Wait for me downstairs.
One thing, Domenico.
One evening you told me:
"Let's pretend to love each other".
That evening I really loved you,
you didn't.
You pretended.
When you left, you gave me
the usual 100 lire.
Here it is.
I actually marked year and day.
Then you left as usual.
When you were back I was pregnant.
You were told I was sick
and I had gone up in the country.
I need these numbers.
That's the date that I wrote.
That's it.
Keep it.
One does not pay for children.
What's happening?
Nothing.
I go to get a coffee.
Are you sick? Shall I come with you?
No, I'll be right back.
Here it is the final proof!
Alfredo, look here.
- Sleeping?
- No, thinking.
Don't think, look.
The Milan woman...
The surgeon's wife. What thighs!
Read the dedication.
"Bellagio, summer 1946.
Three dream months. Marisetta. "
If I was in Bellagio with Marisetta...
I could not stay here with Filumena.
Counting nine months,
this cannot be my son.
Unless he was seven months premature.
The glove maker, seven months premature?
A big young man like him?
August, July, June, May...
Don't yawn, take a coffee.
The key is in the 100 lire bill.
No it can't!
They were out of date with the
currency of the Americans.
No! I asked.
They existed till '51.
The 50 lire were withdrawn.
Damn me!
If I gave 50 lire,
I could calculate it.
No, Mimì Soriano was great!
What idiot!
Let's sum it up.
The glove maker is seventh month
premature.
The mechanic... Before everything
was clear, that was excluded.
I was in Paris with the horse team.
Then in London.
I've got stamps on the passport.
Swear once more that you don't know it.
I swear!
Can't you hear a voice from blood?
It tells me that I was wrong so many times.
I run a lot without
ever reaching a finishing line.
Filumena!
I've been waiting for you ten days.
I feel like I have turned
into a policeman.
What do you want?
Talk!
How can I talk
if you are standing?
Anyhow...
Acknowledge that what you said
was a lie.
Now you are calm
and it is right I stay calm too.
You have just told a bunch of lies...
Including the story about a date
on a 100 lire bill.
Come on, you are illiterate.
You can't even write your own name!
It is true.
But there are only three numbers,
a date...
I can write that.
I didn't write it
thinking of a blackmail.
It was an important evening,
beautiful!
How can you forget?
What year was it?
We were under the Germans?
The Americans?
What suit did I have? What shoes?
What person are you?
You remember year and day
of a pair of shoes...
- But not that...
- What can I do?
Twenty years!
How the world changed
and it is still the same!
Houses, buildings, skyscrapers...
And in the middle...
An old drama like ours.
It is old because you are.
Even in America
there are many skyscrapers...
And in the skyscrapers
there are old dramas.
It is a different matter.
We used to have a big heart.
Now look how small it is.
Keep it.
Filumena!
Do you leave like this?
What are you doing?
You put lipstick on again?
- How old are you?
- 15.
You asked me that yesterday already.
- Thus you were born in '49.
- Yes.
- What month?
- March, 25th.
Do you want to tell me my horoscope?
Please!
That's it.
- What's the problem with the car?
- I don't know.
Let's see... move over.
An idiot had unplugged
a wire of your plugs.
Always lock the bonnet.
So you have no surprises.
- How much I owe you?
- Nothing. Tip the boy.
Totò, give us a clean to mister's!
Talc has dried up.
We have the same hand!
No, I have size 8, you have 9!
Shape is what counts, not size.
Can I?
The middle finger is the same...
The thumb no.
They are not the same.
Almost the same.
They are not the same!
- Riccardo!
- Excuse me a moment.
Hello, miss, you were
going to come yesterday.
- Your parcel is ready.
- Thanks.
You are prettier and prettier.
Don't be late tonight.
- At eight. Bye!
- Bye.
- Bye!
- Bye.
- You like women, don't you?
- Me, yes!
You go otherwise I'm going
to slap this old pussy.
That's enough, Filumena. Enough!
Now you must tell me
which of the three is my son!
You must tell me...
Otherwise I do not know
what's going to happen!
Now I know why you took me
to Vesuvius.
You want to throw me in?!
You want to know it?
And I tell you.
Maybe it's better, so you can help him.
- He still has no job...
- The student one!
Yes, Umberto.
Umberto.
Umberto.
Of course...
He has chosen a difficult path.
But if he studies and is willing...
To study he cannot live...
In the confusion of your house.
Too many people...
Studying is hard...
He needs...
And then, going to university...
Soriano's son...
What coincidence!
The one who needs more help
than anybody.
What should a mother do...
If not helping the one
who needs it most.
But you didn't believe it,
you are smart.
- It's Riccardo.
- The glove maker?
No, it's Michele.
Again!
You want to put
my shoulders against the wall!
Did you notice?!
As soon as I told you
it was the one who studies...
At once you thought of helping him,
and giving money!
But only to him,
not to the other two.
What would happen?
Interest would put them
one against the other.
Don't be selfish Domenico!
Don't think of you.
Don't think of me.
Let's leave things as they are.
Tonight I go to your children
and I tell them the truth...
That I am rich, and so on.
And that one of them is my son.
You work out who is the heir!
Domenico!
Domenico,
you have to leave them alone!
You can't put them
one against each other!
Stay away from them,
remember...
Let me go! Filumena!
If you talk to them, I kill you!
But not like you
who said that to me for twenty years!
Shut your mouth!
They must be all equal!
- You stop!
- I kill you!
- Shut up!
- I kill you!
- Shut up!
- I kill you!
I always loved you...
And now more than ever.
Hello.
You were talking,
don't you talk any more?
We were just chatting,
Don Domenico.
Sit down.
It's already six in the morning...
And your mother, as usual...
I don't like "Don Domenico".
How would you like to be called?
I thought you got that.
I soon marry your mother...
If she comes! Because you never
know with her.
From tomorrow you will bear my name:
Soriano.
Who likes horses among you?
- Why laugh?
- What money do we play with?
As a young man I loved singing.
- Who sings among you?
- Not me.
- Me neither.
- I do.
- You sing?
- Yes.
Let me hear.
Sing "Munasterio 'e Santa Chiara".
It's an old song.
- Sing the riff.
- I can't sing here.
Quietly. Just a bit.
Come on, let's hear it!
Munasterio 'e Santa Chiara, tengo 'o core scuro scuro. 
I can sing like that too!
You have no voice!
Isn't it voice?
Then I am Enrico Caruso.
You try!
I am not so arrogant as him.
- Just a bit.
- Yes.
Munasterio 'e Santa Chiara... 
- How is it?
- Tengo 'o core scuro scuro. 
Pecché ogne sera penzo a Napule comm'era, penzo a Napule comm'è. 
Nun è overo, nun ce crero. E moro cu 'sta smania 'e turna' a Napule. 
Ma ch'aggio 'a fa? Me fa paura 'e ce turna'. 
Be quiet! It is not possible!
Three Neapolitans who cannot sing.
- Best wishes, Donna Filumena!
- Thanks!
This dress hangs a bit!
Only you can see a defect.
I've been making them for years...
You deny evidence!
Okay, to make you happy
I say it hangs.
- Donna Filumena you are beautiful!
- I feel all mixed up this morning.
You are perfect!
You are still blossoming.
The boss is a good person
but his wife...
- You want to stay at the petrol station?
- Yes, I like it.
Always too tight these shoes!
My wishes!
- Mamma mia, these shoes.
- Take them off if they hurt.
- Best wishes!
- What a good ceremony!
How tiring!
Bring me a glass of water.
Let's go, let mom rest.
Bye.
- Bye Riccardo.
- Are you living?
- Bye, Mom.
- Goodbye, Don Domenico.
- Mom.
- Michelino!
- See you tomorrow?
- See you...
Bye Papa.
Bye Papa.
- See you tomorrow?
- Yes!
Let's go.
What are you doing, Filumena?
Domenico, I am crying...
And it is beautiful!
