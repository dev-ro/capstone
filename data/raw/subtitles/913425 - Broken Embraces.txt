BROKEN EMBRACES
What's your name?
Harry Caine.
I used to be called Mateo.
and I was a film director.
I was always tempted by the idea
of being someone else,
as well as myself.
Living one life
wasn't enough for me.
So I invented a pseudonym:
Harry Caine,
an adventurer who, as fate
would have it, became a writer.
I made him sign all
the stories and scripts I wrote.
For years,
Mateo Blanco and Harry Caine
shared the same body.
Mine.
But there came a time when,
suddenly, I could only
be Harry Caine.
I became my alter-ego.
a self made writer
created by himself.
There was just one unexpected detail.
Harry Caine
would be a blind writer.
Ernesto Martel is dead!
Who?
Ernesto Martel.
I know his granddaughter.
So he's dead...
Yes. Did you know him?
What interests you?
Politics,
the economy, culture...?
I'm interested in you.
What are you like?
Can you describe yourself?
What do you want to know?
Your measurements, for example.
36 - 26 - 36.
What color are your eyes?
Green,
With blue highlights in the summer.
Your hair?
How are you dressed?
I'm blonde,
with long, straight hair.
I'm wearing a purple tank top,
tight jeans...
Tight?
Yes, tight.
And heels.
High heels?
Very high.
Let's see...
Blonde hair,
long.
Let's see your eyes...
Green eyes
with blue highlights in the summer.
and your skin...
Such beautiful skin.
Lips...
juicy.
May I use the washroom?
At the end of the hallway.
Sorry, I thought you were alone.
Can I come in or
are you having another round?
No, no, come in please.
We've finished.
She helped me cross the street,
so I invited her in to read me the paper.
This place is in shambles.
- What are you looking for?
- My shirt.
Here.
Your shirt.
Something else?
your socks?
Well Harry, I'll be off.
- Thanks for your help.
- You're welcome.
- You're standing on my foot.
- I'm sorry!
It was a pleasure.
Likewise.
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.
Well, I have to go.
I hope we meet again.
You can't just bring home the first person
who helps you cross the street!
Something might happen to you.
Everything has already
happened to me
All I can do now is enjoy life.
Diego told me that you finished
the script yesterday.
Almost, I want to add a final epilogue.
I was supposed to deliver it to the
producer and director today.
You'll have it tomorrow,
don't worry.
Ernesto Martel is dead.
He was very ill.
It's been a long time
since we last spoke of him.
Yes, that's true.
You look awful.
Because I was running.
It's Monday
You don't have to run for my sake, Diego
We're in no rush.
I am.
I promised the script.
Don't worry you'll have it tonight
Diego, we're changing the ending.
Right away?
I've been thinking about the next script.
Some fantasy or horror for teens.
That's what sells best.
I don't know if I can.
I'd thought about,
developing a story based
on Arthur Miller's son.
- The writer who married Marilyn?
- Yes.
It was in Vanity Fair.
I read it in the paper.
After Marilyn,
he married the photographer Inge Morath
and they had a child.
He was born with Down's syndrome
and Miller hid him away.
He didn't even mention him
in his memoirs.
and he never wanted to see him.
Despite his wife's pleas,
he would never see the child.
That's horrible!
One day,
they met by chance.
Miller gave a lecture in defense
of a mental retard,
who'd been sentenced to death
after making a forced confession.
His son with Down's syndrome
was in the audience.
After the speech,
the son went up to the podium
and embraced his father.
Miller didn't know how to
get free of that man,
until the stranger let go
and said:
"I am your son Daniel
"and I'm very proud of you, dad."
I don't think we can write
about Arthur Miller
Without asking the family
for permission.
We can change the names.
It isn't about the
pettiness of the father.
but the strength of the son,
who survives without any grudge
towards the parent who ignored
him his whole life.
The subject is interesting.
But years ago
when you got back to
writing scripts
You told me you would never write
remakes, sequels, or biopics.
I remember perfectly, because
I was surprised about biopics.
It isn't a biopic,
it's about surpassing oneself
and inate goodness.
Yes, I'll get it.
I brought yogurt
but he's out of cleaning
products and juice too
and pick up his dry cleaning.
Hey guys, I'm going.
- Talk to you later, Henry
- OK, Judit, OK.
- How's it going?
- Good. You?
Good. Do you have the set?
Freshly downloaded from eMule!
Cool!
Do you want a hit of Crystal?
Not tonight.  I need to sleep
once in awhile.
Cover me.
Try to be discreet.
There's no one around!
Buy me a drink?
Order what you want.

Death of businessman
Ernesto Martel.
Obituary: Ernesto Martel,
the Chilean-born financier
died yesterday
at his residence in Madrid.
Living in Spain since childhood, Martel was
one of the leading businessmen of the 90s
Ermar Capital, his empire
created in the 80's,
financed major infrastructure
projects in latin america.
Maried twice,
with two children,
his reputation was tainted
in recent years
by his involvment in the
Apresto scandal
Accused of fraud and tax evasion
in 2002
He was sentenced to
three years in prison.
I just spoke with
the Transport Minister
The project is under way.
We will build the subway in Caracas.
For sure, there is a lot of money.
For at least five years.
I'm looking for a qualified company
and thought of you.
Of course.
Everything will go through me.
The president told me himself.
I'll call you later, OK?
Yes Mr. Martel?
Lena...
Can you come into my office?
I want to dictate.
Yes sir, right away.
It's for the Industry Minister.
"Dear Antonio, I am pleased..."
Sorry, I'm sorry.
Are you feeling alright?
"I am pleased to announce that soon,
"I'll be meeting with a
Venezuelan delegation..."
Sorry.
Tell me what's wrong.
I'm sure I can help.
My father is very i'll
He's being discharged this afternoon
and I want to be there.
Of course.
What's wrong with him?
Stomach cancer,
and it's metastasized
Oh, I'm sorry.
Where's Papa?
He's waiting inside.
I can't believe they left you here,
on the street, like dogs.
Wasn't the doctor
operating this week?
He was supposed to.
This morning he told us
they were discharging him.
I asked what that meant.
He said: "It's simple,
it's July, I'm going on vacation."
What?
I asked: "Are you putting us
on the street?"
"No, ma'am.
"I'm sending him home."
"But what can I do with him
at home?"
"That's your problem.
I'm going on vacation."
"He's dying."
"So, he can die
peacefully at home.'
They can't torture him for 20 days
with tests and then do this.
Ladies!
Have you forgotten about me?
What are you saying, dad!
No one could forget you.
Sweetheart.
Take it easy.
Isn't it nice to get out?
I'll put the bags in.
You'll be comfortable here.
I'll bring your pills.
Try to rest.
I'm leaving now.
I've a lot to do.
Call me if there's anything.
I'll come by in the morning.
Bye, mom.
Take care.
Madame Mylène? Hi it's Séverine.
Severine! It's been so long.
How nice to hear from you.
- I need some money.
- When?
Now. I'm free on the week-end.
During the week I'm busy.
I'll see what I can do.
Can I call you tonight?
Of course.
I'll be waiting.
Séverine?
Who's this?
I'm calling on behalf of
Madame Mylène.
You're mistaken.
There's no Séverine here.
I must have the wrong number.
Forgive me.
Your rails, ma'am.
Hi, has he called you?
Who?
The client, who else?
How dare you give him my number!
I couldn't refuse.
That's not how it works!
Are you crazy?
He knows all about you.
I didn't tell him
he found out by himself.
He knows that you
tried your hand at acting,
and at times you've
"performed" for me.
Months ago he made me promise
that if you contacted me again
I'd call him.
I couldn't refuse,
he's my best client.
Oh, Magdalena!
Mom, how's dad?
Awful!
We had a terrible night.
He's been vomiting blood
and everything.
it's like he'd burst inside.
I don't know what to do.
I'm coming.
Mr. Martel? It's Lena.
I'm sorry to bother you.
You never bother me.
I'm calling because
my father is dying.
He has to be hospitalized,
but i don't know where.
They sent him home yesterday
and we don't know what to do.
Don't worry.
We'll take him to a private clinic.
I'll take care of it.
Don't worry, Dr. Blasco is
the best digestive surgeon in Europe.
Here.
How's the patient?
He arrived in very poor condition.
I think you know that.
Can you save him?
I am Ernesto Martel.
We'll try our very best.
- But right now we can't operate.
- And tomorrow?
Perhaps.
We're feeding him intravenously
and he'll need a transfusion
to survive.
Do the impossible to save him.
Of course.
That's my duty.
I'll keep you informed on the progress
Can I stay?
Of course, you can stay with him
as long as you wish.
I can't thank you enough.
I'm at your disposal ma'am.
Do you want me to stay with you?
No, go on, love,
you've done enough.
Should I bring you some food?
No, don't bother
I'll get something later.
I'll call you.
Who's there?
It's Ray X.
Ray X?
Nobody's called that.
It's a nickname
I used to do lots of ecstasy.
What do you want?
I want to write a script with you
and direct it myself.
You're a director?
I made a very good documentary
14 years ago.
This would be my first fiction.
Call my agent Judit Garcìa,
and talk to her
She can make an appointment for you
I'm going for a shower.
You got me out of the bathroom.
You gonna stay there all day?
You didn't give me
Judit Garcìa's number
Look it up.
She's a well-known production manager.
I'm going.
Yes, go on.
A young director rang me.
Ray X.
He wants to write a script with you.
- You know about it? Yes
- He wants to see you this afternoon.
Or tomorrow.
I asked for an advance,
and he agreed.
but I can't go with you,
I'm busy with the Americans.
OK, I'll see him
and tell you about it.
I hope you like him,
he seems to be well-heeled.
Have you seen him?
No from his voice,
and from the check he's going to sign.
I'll send Diego so you're not alone.
Ciao
Alicante or Barcelone?
- I'm here to see Harry.
- Yes, he's in his office.
Hi, I'm Ray X.
How are you?
Have a seat.
I'm listening
I really like your work.
I've seen all of it.
Thank you very much.
Let's get to the point.
What kind of story
do you want to write?
I'd like to write a story about
a son's revenge on his
father's memory.
Why does the son want revenge?
The father destroyed him
and ruined his life.
How?
The father is a violent man,
a homophobe.
unscrupulous and very powerful.
But the son is a sensitive boy,
but he's got lots of complexes
and he's weak.
He always tries to please his father.
He's a homosexual but
he got married twice, like his father.
And he separated,
like he did.
He's got a son, who hates him
as much as he hated his father.
When the father dies.
the son can finally rebuild his life.
That's his salvation, his revenge.
and the story I want to tell.
I fear I'm not the writer
you're looking for.
You are!
More than you know.
I'll pay whatever you ask.
It's too personal.
Make it your own.
Thank's, but no.
Now, if you don't mind... Diego!
I'll leave you my number.
If you change your mind.
- Come along!
- Leave me alone!
I'm sure we'll see each other again.
In my case,
that would be a miracle.
- Please, come with me
- I'm coming!
Son of a bitch!
- He was talking about himself, right?
- I guess.
Look in the top drawer.
Look through the photos
of the '94 shoot.
He may be in one of them.
Keep looking.
Here he is.
Describe the photo.
He's with you on the shoot.
He's got long, straight hair
and he's holding a camera.
I knew it.
Who is he?
Ernesto Martel's son.
What can he want now?
Put the photos away and
close the drawer.
Ernesto, it's me.
We have to talk about our son.
Not now, Rosanna
I caught him trying on my dresses.
It's your fault.  You made him
effeminate to humiliate me.
I'm sending him to you.
After all, you're his father.
If I haven't been a good father
for 19 years, I doubt I'll learn now.
I have to go.
And tell him if he wants to talk to me
he can call me himself.
- Don't be so hard on them.
- Theyr'e blackmailers!
- Help me with my necklace
- Of course.
Why no invite your son here
for a few days?
That's what his mother just said.
But it's best not
to involve you with them.
He'd keep me company.
-Does he like the cinema or theatre?
- Very much I think.
His mother says
he's a bit of a fairy.
If I invite him
I'd like you to tell me if it's true.
and if it can be fixed.
- How will I know?
- You don't have to screw him.
Oh thanks alot.
But you pretty girls
know those things.
Call him, but I won't do that.
What I don't like is
that you're living with a man.
What'll your children think?
That their father is homosexual.
He's got good taste
and that hes lucky.
If they love me, they'll accept it.
You should've told me
before we got married.
If you'd stopped thinking about
my father's fortune you'd have realized.
What do you mean?
I'm hangin up. Pain in the ass!
I've got another call.
- I hope it's not your other ex-wife?
- I hope not.
Never get married, Mario.
I'm not planning to right now.
It's Judit Garcìa.
Hi, did you get the money?
I don't want it.
I'm sending it back.
Ernesto.
Won't you call me Ray?
That's my artistic name.
Artistic?
What are you trying to do?
Erase my father's name.
What's that got to do with Harry?
I've wanted to see him for ages.
And it's true I want to make a film
and have him write the script.
I've got the male lead.
You're not a director.
If you saw my documentary
you'd change your mind.
Ernesto, forget about us.
Don't be afraid of me.
I'm not my father.
Stay away from Harry.
Or else I'll report you for harassment!
I really don't want to
scout for locations.
But the Americans are paying
me a fortune and we need it.
Go on,
don't worry about me.
Give me Tonino Guerra's book.
I'm worried about Harry too.
Look after him while I'm away
I'm busy,
I can't spend all day with him.
It's only 2 weeks.
Harry's fine on his own.
It's because of Ernesto Junior.
If he shows up again or calls
let me know right away.
Why are you so worried?
He's crazy.
I don't trust him.
Why not?
- It's a long story.
- Summarize.
This isn't the time.
For you, it never is!
If you really mind looking after Harry,
i'm staying in Madrid.
Or hire someone else.
I don't mind keeping him company,
but I'm sick of all the secrets.
When's your mother back?
I'm not sure,
in ten days, I think.
What are you looking at?
A poster that says
"Give blood".
- You want to give yours?
- No, no.
I just like the sound of it.
It would be a great film title.
It sounds good
Like a vampire film.
That's true.
Imagine that behind the ad
there's a group of vampires
who work in various donor clinics
they keep the donated blood
and use it themselves.
Your mother would like that story.
We'll write it.
The vampires live like the Chinese,
as part of Spanish society
but without attracting attention.
and like the Chinese they
also control several industries.
Like sunglasses, for example.
And late night bars, discos,
after hours clubs.
They don't need drugs to stay awake
so they're the best night workers.
And the sun cream business.
They're sensitive to climate change
and to holes in the ozone.
Their sun creams
are the best on the market.
That's good.
It must be a thick cream
like armor,
to protect them all day
That's how the story begins.
A very beautiful girl,
totally naked.
covering her body
with a really thick cream
before going to work in a donor clinic.
Her body has a beautiful,
velvety pallor.
Great beginning.
We need a love story.
A mixed love story
between the young vampire girl
and a normal boy.
She works in one of those
blood donor clinics
where they use the blood themselves.
He goes there to give blood.
They instantly like each other.
After she puts the needle in his vein,
she get really aroused.
They start dating,
but she doesn't want him to become a vampire
Those vampires don't proselytize.
They don't bite people.
unless it's really necessary.
But they like sex right?
Sure.
That'll be one of the problems
because we need some tension.
They relaly desire each other
but when it comes to screwing,
she holds back.
Why?
In case she loses control and bites
his jugular in the heat of passion
She lets him do everything, in front
behind, whatever
Except kiss her on the mouth.
And her breasts?
That's a high risk area.
When he kisses her breasts,
She hides her face with the pillow
and she rips it apart with her teeth.
And when she sucks on him?
No blowjobs!
She'd tear it off right away
Well, a man can do without kisses,
but it's tough when
they won't suck your dick!
He's so in love
he accepts it.
When they know each other better,
she'll wear a muzzle
to protect both of them.
When she gets aroused,
she has a kind of dental erection,
and her mouth grows out
like shes a wolf.
I really like your story.
You will sign this one.
I'll be your sparring partner,
like you've always been for me.
The music you play
is fucking great!
And I really like you.
Did Alex tell you?
I want us to be great friends
and you have to tell me everything.
Let me work.
You have to tell me everything.
I need a drink.
Sorry, he's high on GHB.
I don't like being touched up.
You want some MDMA?
- Just a bit!
- OK.
I'm working tomorrow.
We're working on a great vampire script.
Want some GHB?
I've had some MDMA.
I think your friend likes me.
Are you ok, Diego?
What is it?
What happened?
- Is that your glass?
- Coke and GHB.
Asshole!
Why did you put it next to his glass!
Take it easy.
Get some ice!
Call an ambulance!
No, I'm a friend of his.
Diego sick.
We're taking him to Emergency
What happened?
Can I speak to him?
Where are you taking him?
- Where are you going?
- Quiròn hospital.
Come on, get in!
He's coming.
That's his jacket.
Do you need help?
I have to go.
You want the hospital?
- Yes, I do.
- I'll go with you.
I'll hold on to you.
- You want Reception?
- Yes.
How do you feel?
I don't know... shocked.
Did you speak to my mother?
- Did you tell her about the coma?
- No! Are you crazy?
Anyway, it was only six hours.
If you ever tell her,
say you fainted.
Or whatever.
I told her you ate something
that disagreed with you.
Did she believe you?
I don't know.
She wanted to rush back
but I persuaded her not to.
Are you sleeping?
No I'm not sleepy.
- You want to talk?
- No.
You want me to talk?
I don't know.
If you want to.
I mean to distract you.
Before I went into films.
I was very good at telling stories
Then will you tell me why my mother
is so afraid of Ernesto Junior?
Is she?
She made me promise
I'd keep an eye out.
In case he reappeared.
She didn't say why?
She never explains anything.
It's a long story.
That's what she says
How do you know him?
It was 14 years ago,
In an office we'd rented
to prepare my latest film.
After writing and directing
five dramas,
I'd finally written a comedy,
or so I thought.
I wanted to change genres
and take a risk.
And I certainly did.
Take a risk, I mean.
Mateo!
There's a girl here.
She doesnt have an appointment.
What's she like?
Too pretty to be funny.
She's the financier Ernesto Martel's
mistress.
She's here with his son.
Is she an actress?
If she's been with that man
for two years she must be.
But come out and say hello,
just to be polite.
You have to be nice to important men.
You never know.
OK.
GIRLS AND SUITCASES
Lena.
Mateo.
I'm Ernesto Martel... Junior.
I apologize for turning up like this.
I heard you were holding auditions for
your next film.
- Yes
- I'd love to audition.
I can come another day.
Now that you're here,
we'll read something.
Stay here.
The reading didn't work out.
We were both too nervous.
The first meeting
only served to show me
that the mere presence
of that woman disturbed me.
Where were you this morning?
Didn't Ernesto tell you?
I didn't ask him.
We went to see a film director.
to do an audition.
An audition? Why?
I want to work.
Weren't you going
to redecorate the house?
You have to change the furniture,
carpets, lamps...
I don't know how to do that.
Hire a decorator.
Even if I do,
you'll have to guide him.
I want to be an actress.
I always have.
You tried before...
and look how you ended up.
That was a low blow.
I'm sorry, my love,
forgive me.
I'm going upstairs.
Lena, please.
Don't get angry, darling,
I beg you.
In any case, don't worry.
I was no good.
I was too nervous.
Telephone
Its Mr. Mateo Blanco.
Enter!
He says it's important.
It was the director.
The audition wasn't enough,
he wants to see me again.
What are you going to do?
Go and see him, no?
I need to do something.
I've always wanted to be an actress.
And what about me?
Hi this is Magdalena Rivero.
I want to cancel my massage tomorrow.
I'll call you another time.
Thank you.
They still haven't given me the part.
They will.
If they do, it wont change a thing.
except that I'll be working too,
like you.
And at night we'll tell each other
what we've done.
Why don't we get married?
I'm asking you to marry me.
Haven't you got married
and divorced enough times?
With you, it would be the first time.
We've been living together for two years.
We're fine like this.
Don't you think?
It seems you don't
Ernesto Martel offered to
produce the film.
You mother didn't want that.
We were waiting for a grant from
the Minstry...
- You want help?
- No, I'll show you.
...and a television pre-sale
But that would take months.
And I was in a real hurry
to start shooting.
Just like Audrey!
Spot on, faggot!
Totally Audrey!
Divine!
Move closer to the mirror.
Light up your face.
Now look at me in profile.
with an exaggerated smile,
like the model.
Like that one?
Yes.  Come on.
Open your eyes more
and close your mouth a bit.
Come on. Now.
Very good.  Again.
Open your mouth a little more.
Now.
Wonderful.
Again.
- Art!
- Totally!
Now i'd like to try something
much more daring.
A platinum blonde wig.
Something very pop.
I've got one.
I've got a Goldie Hawn type,
with much more volume.
That'll look fabulous.
- But she mustn't look like a poodle.
- No?
If she isn't a poodle
she isn't Goldie.
I told you he wouldn't like Goldie, faggot!
He wears it when he gets dressed.
- So, platinum blonde.
- Yes.
I'll change your make up.
Get out of the way!
Look, the wig's false,
it's really bad.
It's Kanecalon fiber,
but it looks fabulous.
OK, let's have a look.
You'll flip out.
Put these on.
Judit, can you move to your left?
Are you tired?
Don't smile,
The wig is false enough.
That's it.
Wonderful.
From the start,
Judit didn't like Lena.
But I like her more every day.
And Ernesto Junior liked me.
and I intended to use that.
His father had asked him to make a
documentary about the shoot.
As for Ernesto Sr.
I'd never met a man
so obsessed by a woman.
He was producing the film
in a desperate attempt not to lose Lena.
This is shit!
It's incomprehensible!
In the midst of that
emotional panorama,
we started shooting.
Now think of all the times
you've made gazpacho for Iván.
How he enjoyed it.
And that breaks your heart.
We'll do the first time you come
home after a photo session.
As soon as you open the door,
you look over at the answering machine.
If it's flashing, it may be Ivan.
"If it isn't flashing,
it'll be another day of despair
because you've been
looking for him for two days.
All right. OK, OK.
Listen, did you like the
bit with the tomatoes?
Yes a lot.
It moved me.
Me too,
It really moved me.
It's amazing that you could
be moved by tomatoes.
It wasn't the tomatoes
it was the nice things
you were saying to me."
They like each other?
Do you think they like each other?
Me?
I don't know anything.
I only look at their lips.
Samples?
What do you think?
Cut!
Very good. Print it.
- Are you going to do anything?
- No, you can go.
I don't mind staying.
You should go.
I'm going to check some wigs.
Wigs? I love that!
Enough! You've filmed hours of wigs.
This is more of the same.
And Lena?
After we've tried the new wigs
she wants a massage.
She's got a contraction.
I haven't got any contractions.
Couldn't I film it?
Ernesto, please,
don't be such a pain. Go home!
Bye.
Edurne...
I'm going to speak to Lena.
I don't want to be interrupted.
Don't worry, I'll see to it.
I'll be your watchdog.
Wait.
Is his son out there?
No, I sent him home.
Edurne's keeping watch.
Mateo, this is crazy.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Waiting for you.
I didn't think filmmaking was
such hard work.
Yes.  It doesn't stop.
It's very absorbing.
Aren't you tired?
Chocolate gives me energy.
I love bitter orange with chocolate.
I meant the shoot, not the chocolate.
Oh, very.
At the end of the week, I'm exhausted.
But I'm happy.
I thought we could take a break.
A weekend, just you and I.
in the house on Ibiza.
We rehearse on weekends.
Don't you rehearse during the shoot?
Do you spend
the whole day rehearsing?
That's how films are made!
What about our life?
You can't just set it aside for months.
The film sets the rules.
No, I set them.
I'm the producer.
- Is there a problem?
- Yes.
It's completely impersonal.
I asked for a graphic set
but this is totally dead!
-Shall I speak to Antxon?
No, I'll do it.
What's wrong with you?
You look awful.
Its Diego.
He could hardly breathe all night.
Neither of us got any sleep.
You still don't know what it is?
Some doctors say it's asthma,
others that he's allergic.
but we don't know to what.
They're still investigating,
but we're desperate.
Take all the time that you need.
Right now,
your son is what matters.
Another thing,
- I was talking to the producer.
- And?
He's complaining that Lena's
too absorbed by the shooting.
How does he think films are made?
Ernesto is a business man,
not an artist.
No one asked him
to become a producer!
It's too late to argue about that.
He's taking her to Ibiza this weekend.
So you cannot rehearse.
Son of a bitch.
Get rid of the table,
lamps and chairs!
I wanted a graphic set
but it should be alive.
God I look terrible!
You are scared when I touch you
but not when you see me dead?
I didn't think you were dead.
I thought you were sleeping.
I usually snore.
If I'd thought you were dead
I wouldn't have got made up for you.
Any man of my age could have a heart attack
after screwing six times.
You're not a man of your age.
I wouldn't mind dying
after fucking you for days,
weeks, months,
years, centuries.
I'm crazy about you,
you drive me crazy.
I guess you know that.
Yes.
I think I do.
Look at what I found on the sidewalk.
They fell off your terrace.
They were gifts from Ivan,
I threw them out.
You can't do that, Miss Pina.
You could kill someone.
In Naples, on New Year's Eve,
they even throw out furniture.
My grandpa was Neapolitan
and it's in my blood.
But this isn't Naples
and today isn't New Year's Eve.
I was nervous, throwing them out
relaxes me. You keep them.
They'll come in handy.
"Love... '
You say "love", I say "sex"!
Cut!
- Shall we print it?
- Like hell!
I'll fix your make up after, OK?
You're not on form today.
I know.
What's wrong?
I'll tell you later.
- Take a sandwich break.
- 30 minutes?
We'll take a 30 minute sandwich break!
Let's clear this a bit and go outside.
No lips.
I've had a horrible weekend.
But we didn't rehearse
so that you could rest.
Rest?
I had that son of a bitch
on top of me for 48 hours.
He didn't let up for a second.
The bastard.
I'm living on tranquilizers
No lips.
No, no.
I'll get over it and I'll do it.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
You have to be witty
and light.
Of course.
Light...
You don't know what it's like
having that monster on top of you
for 48 hours.
It makes me sick.
It's best
if you don't think about it.
It's best if you and I
never talk about Ernesto.
It's best not to
open that can of worms.
What do you do with your notebooks?
I fill them.
And then?
I burn them.
I'd rather the notebooks slept here.
Slept?
Leave them here,
you'll get them back tomorrow.
When you finish,
I'll keep them.
Very well.
Whatever you say.
- What time tomorrow?
- I'll call you when the material is ready.
I presume you are aware of the total
confidentiality of your work.
Of course.
My father was asking why
I don't go with you to yoga.
Tell him that I'm grown up, and free,
and that I've forbidden you to follow me.
I can't tell him that.
Try it.
It would do you good.
I can't.
Do what you like,
but don't come with me.
You're such a pain!
What are you doing?
Working.
Turn that off!
Didn't Mateo
forbid you to tape us off the shoot?
My father told me to ignore that,
he wants to see everything.
Neither of you has any scruples!
Fucking leave me alone!
Remember I'm taping you.
Stop, I said.
Stop!
I told you to stop!
Give me the fucking camera!
You're crazy!
- Give it to me!
- Let go! My camera!
Focus on me.
Listen carefully.
Yes, I'm talking to you.
I've just been with the man I love.
and I'm happier than I've ever been
beacuse that man loves me too,
a lot.
Don't worry,
I'll leave you in peace very soon.
You needn't spy on us anymore.
There's nothing to hide now.
I don't know if you got back a
little late or early.
It was raining, we couldn't shoot.
Where are you going?
I am leaving you.
Shouldn't we talk first?
I've said all I had to say to you.
Lena, please!
Goodbye.
Listen to me.
Let go.
Turn over, my love.
I'll help you.
Let me do it.
Relax, I'll help you.
You could have broken something.
I'll take off your shoes.
You'll be more comfortable.
I'll see to everything.
Come on!
Help me.
Sit down, but be careful.
My darling.
That's it.
I'll take you to the hospital.
