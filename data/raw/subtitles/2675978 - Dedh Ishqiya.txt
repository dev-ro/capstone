Sir Khitanwi
What do you say?
There was a Moulvi,
Do I look like a Nawab?
And Moulvi had a hen
Yes you are
That hen always abuses everyone
But... Your not
Yes
Even a scoudrel like me should shy
Moulvi was really upset with his hen
He went to his friend Qazi
and told him that my hen abuses
a lot so please do something
I have Madam's old jewellery
Qazi told him that bring her to me
I have two parrots,
His husban's turban
they use to pray all day long
Sword too
If she will stay with them so
she will be reformed
Moulvi left his hen to Qazi
Feel it
Qazi took the hen and...
Put her into the cage with
both parrots
When hen entered into cage
Both parrots were smiling
On the spot they quit praying
Your blood has the same shade
then one parrot whisper to
another parrot
Red
What is it?
May I whisper in your ears.
That I cant become the nawab
Of Mehmoodabad
What?
Till today
Who ever has taken birth
Has his own DNA
What did he said?
Diff rent from each other from
day one
Till now and onwards
He said stop praying our
prays are fulfilled
Wow
You have solved an old
This in injustice,
Mistry of mine
Meaning?
What are you doing?
There is a sevrage passage
In the centre of the city
Why you are taking Khalu's
revenge from me,
If I would have bad intention so
I would have flee
Yes... near that there is a mention
I didn't go anywhere,
Who is owned by Nawab Sahab
Look!
And the other side
Contains the city
Please trust me,
You guys are in hurry!
The other side of the
Sevrage passage
At least ask me my last wish
I used to walk down the streets
People used to bow down
You want to narrate me another joke
No!
With fear
Story!
And when Nawab sahab used to
walk down the streets
People used to bow down
With respect
Whatever it is
Tell me how can it be changed?
This is in born and can not be changed
Your kidding
One thousand Rupees daily,
Now a days organ trasplants are commaâ€œ
But this does not change
Did you tie Nawab inside this Sherwani
You are getting angry
These are the sherwanis of
real nawab
Thats why you are lying
He is gone for Hajj that's why you
can take them on rent
I have a lot of money
I'll give you what ever
You demand
If you want I'll pack both of them,
No!
Give some ordinary dress,
You sure
Its possible in Italy
Why?
We can try there
A servant is necessary with Nawab
You Nawab?
Yes!
We will both go there
When?
You wear anything but you will
look like a servant
As soon as I get merried to begum
We will fly First class
You are talking too much,
And if she does not merry you?
Since when they are shivering,
From few days
Then you will go by your self
In a coffin
His hands are shivering from many days
It's sunlight you should have see them
in morning
It's like earthquake,
You know what I do?
I put 4 eggs in the bowl and put
him the spoon
and he prepare the nice omlett.
Come with me,
Please come with me
I was just kidding,
Where you taking me?
My grandpa!
He is a famous doctor,
Would you like to meet him,
Alladin's pott
What happen?
Nawab is saying that...
these necklace are not so good
they are very bad,
they stinks...
What are you saying?
You take this...
Pervez!
Bring the car,
And listen keep the AC on,
There are books everywhere
Nawab can't go to toilet,
Just have a look,
Actually we can't sell it officially.

Greetings
Not many days are left
The state is waiting for your
announcment
Begum
Before you decide
I want to
Let you know something
lam not what you think I am
I am pretending of being a Nawab
I knew that from day one
That you are not a Nawab by heart
You are mistaken
Actually I am not a Nawab at all
I lied about me
But you could not hide the truth too
Your a poet
True and divined
lam nothing of what you think
I am
I am a theif
I know
You have brought an end
to my past
You have given me a new life
I know that theif
I love it when you call me by my name
You will fight alone with world,
You are talking childish things.
Amazing!
please say it again
so he was the Nawab of Chandpur
And we are standing at Mehmoodabad
Railway Station
where all famous poets are
getting gather.
For annual competetion.
This competetion has organized by
Begum from Mehmoodabad in memory
of her late husband.
It was Nawab's last wish that Begum
must get marry
The Old man has gone mad
but only with a poet.
So what is the secret
that from last 3 years
famous poets came from everywhere
and they are gone back with failure
So come let's pray
that in this year's competetion Begum
must find her Nawab.
May I have your attention!
I said May I have your attention!
You will discuss everything today
My name is Muneera Aslam,
In few moments,
Begum Para...
is going to meet this gathering,
There are few things to requesting
to fulfill.
Please don't make any physical
contact with Begum,
and you are restricted to look
into her eyes.
She is so delicate
If somebody stare her longer so
she is gone under devil eye
that's why please avoid any kind of
bad behaviour.
So my guests!
Begum Para!
The day we all waited for
That day has arrived
What has happend to you
I am getting scared
What im doing
'S Tight?
He is Nawab, I am sorry
Nawab Jaanpur!
Its normal to be scared
Did you take your medication
I have seen you before,
When you remember then
must inform me
Let me fix your hair
I am also looking for myself
since long.
Don't be affraid
I am with you
Leave it all on God
Where is Noor Muhammed ltalvi,
Everything would be fine
He was with me till Kaanpur,
The whole state is wiating
for your verdict
I have seen him in train,
Waiting list is so long,
Let's go
but now on last moment,
It's hard to find a nice poet,
No!
It's not like that,
Our Mr. Jaan...
He can defeat any poet in competetion
He is kidding.
You are kidding,
Yesterday he narrated me a
great phrase.
What was the phrase?
Pajama's price is low here
Give me less water in wine
It's like...
There is a price of dress but
not for human
There is a price of dress but
not for human
Give me a bigger glass and
reduce the wine.
In the house of the Lord
All are equal
Tell me the next phrase of this
beautiful poetry.
Late Nawab sahab took an 0th
That after his death
I will give the state a new Nawab
It's not done yet.
I am working on it,
Still!
Now my age is over to get merried
It was like...
Nor my health
But I will have to keep my promise
Somebody throw his shoes.
That to in front of my Lord
Would be a huge sin
Today I
lnfront of all
Let's see who will narrate the
next phrase.
Would like to announce the new
Nawab of Mehmoodabad
If he excepts me
then
That man
Who I want to live with
His name is
Hazoor Jan M.Khan
Why you didn't give me the
ending phrase.
You just give me the phrase.
I am asking to you,7
It was not done,
Did I born it?
Look! Noor Muhammed Behelvi!
ltalvi!
ltalvi? Where is that?
In Italy!
My mom is Italian
So Noor Muhammed ltalvi,
It's like...
I need 20 new poetry till evening,
20 poetry till evening?
and they all must be...
great to hear.
Otherwise I will blow your head.
Somebody tell him that how would
I prepare 20 poetry till evening,
I am not a computer.
Give me some ice,
First words...
then ice,
It's a nice phrase.
Be carefull!
Show some mercy,
I present my poetry to Bugum Para
When I saw him with special look
Then she saw the mirror from new style
After lighting the lamp
Women forces are gone
Only Sikandar was sitting upset there
What has happend to you
My dear guests!
I don't have those sweet words
nor that way of style
with whom all these great poets have
introduced you before me
If I have something
that's only naked beating heart
whose voice.
I would like to present to Begum Para
if you allow me,
Are you ok?
You are looking very buetiful
Thank you
Please calm down
Hold on a minute
Dont come near me
Please listen to me first
What are you doing?
Please don't shoot
Dont act smart
No one move
You can go
But
Don't harm Begum
Sir please
Don't get angry
If you need anything let me know
where did he come from?
He is starting the car
I won't spare you
I have done everything for you.
Greetings!
Greetings!
Are you tired?
Will you take my life,
Would you like to run more?
If I will run more
then my heart will break down
Do you have heart?
I will die,
Show some mercy,
Did you show mercy on me?
You left me alone to die,
I didn't left you
I was protecting myself,
What?
Where is the necklace?
You hit me very hard
Get off the car
Are you hart'?
I missed the necklace that day
Get out
when we escaped.
Do you remember?
Remove your mask
Promise me you won't shoot
When they were shooting on us,
I was felt down in water,
So I left the necklace there
I thought you would have seen that
You have roan the whole plan
I didn't see anything
that's your problem
you never pay attention on work
You swine
I thought you would have seen that
so I ran away
I never expected you to be a
betrayer
so why you didn't came to graveyard
when Mushtaq called us
Did I not tell you?
Why would I came there?
Why would I came to get my
penis cut,
Begum should not be harmed
ls your penis fine?
You are making fun of me?
I'll kill you if you do
I will call Mushtaq.
I will call his number
and you will forget your attitude,
Who made you kidnap her
No!
You won't call Mushtaq

But why?
Because my lusty friend

Sorry Nawab Saheb!
What is this?
You are bleeding,
I am sorry but your car was
out of control
What you have done with my car,
Not worse than my heart.

between love and sex
At least give us one peg.
Meaning a one night stand
Would great you with many chances
When you are carrying a gun,
then you shouldn't read the poetry,
but you should kill the lion.
If you will shoot then you
will also die,
Listen brother
Its my mistake
forgive me
One of us will shoot must somebody
will die
If Khalu will shoot you will
must die,
That I had sex with you
If I will shoot you
But don't talk about love again
then you will think
that I would rather die.
Nobody will shoot.
Do me a favour
Ask your guys,
and leave me alone
Put the guns dows.
You put your weapon down.
No!
You first!
What are you doing?
It's not possible,

from this gathering.
This call was made in a market
They are smart
We will have to move our target
as soon as possible
Once this main door will be closed
My mother and Sonia were batch mates
then no police can follow us,
And if my mother gets to know of all

Police behind the doors.
We will divert them before they
enter.
Where will we hide?
Did you bring the advance?
One more word and I will
blow your brains out

But you can be a cheat
I wish I could explain
If you want to you can
I'll try to understand
You sure

My husband
Was gay
His all day activity was Gambling

I tried
To get separated
No one helped me for that
Not my family or anyone else
I got sick
No medication could heal me

He had every thing morgaged
At the bank
He used to spend loan money his all

I won't leave without you
I have the gun you three leave
Decide who is going
The train is here
Khalu!
You are fond to run
You are getting young from old,
I swear you,
If I will get you I will slice you
in pieces
Are you listening to me?
Babban speaking!
Really?
You are talking in english
You have lost your behaviour.
Look upstairs!
Why you are calling me?
Your incoming is free but I am getting
charge for call
I am Nawab!
We fight with good behaviour
I will shove your Nawab in your ass.
Why did you lie to me?
I didn't lie to you
I just didn't tell you the truth
Look! don't make me confuse.
You said that you felt in that
pipe line
and you left that necklace in
pipe line
I have told you the truth I felt
down in pipe line
and I also dropped the necklace.
Then I got up and picked up
the necklace
Come down I will send you up
from this world
lam fine here.
I am coming,
Throw the ladder
You throw down the knife.
Don't mess with me and throw
down the ladder.
I am enjoying the air here
Come upstairs,
Why did you cut the phone?
I will keep standing here
all night long.
Look!
Listen to me!
Look at my dignity,
If I want I would kill you there
But I love you
What son?
You left me alone to die
lam gonna get my penis cut.
Mushtaq was holding knife on me,
You left me alone.
Listen to me,
It's been half an hour
Hakeem didn't die.
Your disease belongs to your heart
You are sad.
Your childhood wound
some old regrets.
Be happy!
That's your cure.
You are the patient of love
Find a lover.
Then your shivering will be gone.
I always lived for others.
Then your aunt!
Mushtaq!
Then sister and you,
I never got chance to think
about myself.
So I decided,
that I should live for myself before
I die.
If I wouldn't keep myself happy then
how would I keep others.
Then what about about our penis?
I gave that necklace in gift.
Freedom is the best gift of life
Now we will steal that necklace
Which is priceless
We got freedom
You had to pay for it
She have lot of gold in her safe
I thought lovers like you
are only fictionised
You want to steal in your own house.
I wish of your desparation in love
Not my house,
My upcoming in laws house
Love
I was not deserving of your love
Now I will spend my life
with my wife.
You would find someone better then me
But if you not lucky we will meet again
I had my own world
My world was calm now
Do visit my world one day
There is a good news
You have been granted bail
Who has done it?
It's your wife
Get lost
I told you they loved us
Any last wishes?
We wanted to sing a song
