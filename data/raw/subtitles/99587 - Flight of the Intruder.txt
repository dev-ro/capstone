Three Communist PT boats
attacked an American destroyer
off the coast of Vietnam
yesterday,
and today, President Johnson's
response was hard and tough.
He has ordered the U.S. Navy
to continue patrolling there,
and if they are attacked,
to destroy their attackers.
I understand the feelings
of those who regret that
we must undertake air attacks.
I share those feelings.
Some nights, we're
the only airplane going up...
going up into the north
and when you're thinking
you're the only Americans
over North Vietnam,
it kind of makes you wonder
just a little bit, you know.
"What am I doing here?"
We have carefully limited
those raids.
They've been directed
at concrete and steel
and not human lives.
There are at least 850
antiaircraft and missile sites
around Hanoi and Haiphong.
These figures make
Hanoi's air defense
the toughest in the world.
If you can get between...
a ridge between you
and that radar site,
they can't guide
a missile at you.
It's just when you get down
in the delta in the flatlands,
that 30-mile ring around...
the city of Hanoi,
it's... it's a bear.
Representatives of Hanoi
simply returned our message
in a plain envelope.
Residents of North Vietnam's
capital felt confident
in the knowledge
that their city was off-limits
to U.S. warplanes.
With American sons
in the fields far away,
I shall not seek, and l
will not accept the nomination
of my party for another term
as your president.
The greatest honor
history can bestow
is the title of peacemaker.
Do you think it's worth it?
Yeah, l... I don't know.
They... they say we're
fighting for something.
I don't know.
Through a long and bitter
struggle in Vietnam,
American fighting men
have served the cause
of freedom magnificently.
You're... you're pretty scared
when you have to roll in
on something out there,
especially when you look down,
and you see nothing
but a black cloud or
a white cloud down below you.
It's a... it's about as...
as scary a mission
as I've ever been on.
I think it tries you
to just about the maximum,
you know, the missions.
Hey, Morg.
Did you ever notice how...
how some nights you could see
more stars
than other nights?
Huh? You ever notice that?
The stars.
Oh, yeah.
I've got an update.
I'm cycling to
the coast-in point.
You're getting
in a rut.
You're getting in a rut.
I mean, did you ever
stop to think
you're taking your job just
a little bit too seriously?
Look at me--
I enjoy my work.
Yeah, I'll bet.
See, I'm happy.
See? Look.
Enemy search radar
Iooking for company.
Okay...
Time to get on down.
Here we go.
Black Eagle, Devil 5-0-5.
Feet dry.
That's a roger, 5-0-5.
Look at that small-arms fire
down there, Morg.
Every cousin with a rifle, huh?
Jesus, you call that a rifle?
I lost them.
Yeah, you hope.
You got that riverbend ahead?
Just picked it up.
One more minute on this heading
to the turn point.
23 Mike, Mike-- I see them.
Go active on ECM.
Jam 'em up.
ECM active.
We're jammin'.
Where is it?
You got it? You see it?
No, not yet.
SAM, 10:00.
Jam!
Ah, Jesus.
That was a piece of cake.
This is it.
Stepping in to attack.
Arm 'em.
Your pickle is hot.
Get us up to 500 feet, partner,
unless you want to frag
your ass.
Nag, nag, nag.
Ground lock.
Steady...
They're off!
If you got the time,
we got the beer.
How about it?
Did you see anything down there?
Any secondary explosions?
Nothing.
Well, that's real nice.
-Suspected truck park.
-Nothing!
Nothing.
Goddamn it.
Man, there was nothing there.
There never was.
Well, we're really raising hell
with the jungle tonight,
aren't we?
What is it?
What the hell is it?
What is it?
Oh, dear God.
-Oh, God Almighty.
-You got to help me!
Let go of it for a minute!
I don't want to...
Black Eagle,
this is Devil 5-0-5.
I'm declaring emergency!
My bombardier's been hit.
I repeat:
my bombardier's been hit.
Requesting a ready deck
upon arrival!
I'll be on the bridge outside.
This is the enforcer.
Make a ready deck.
We have an emergency inbound.
5-0-5, switch to button three
for approach.
Uh, roger that.
Button three, Devil 5-0-5.
Gear is down.
I got to let go
just for a second.
Come on.
I can do it.
-Got to hang on.
-I'm okay, Jakey.
Hang in there, shipmate.
We're gonna make it.
-Now keep the faith.
-I'll make it.
No strain, partner.
5-0-5, call your ball,
call your ball.
200 ball, six point zero.
Ride your ball.
Working 22 knots.
You're high.
We're gonna make it.
Gotta hang in there.
Oh, geez.
Shit, he's still too high!
Jakey...
You're too high!
Morg!
Steady your line,
steady your line.
Come left, Jake.
I'm coming in.
He's too high!
Wave him off!
5-0-5, wave off! Wave off!
Tie 'em down!
Tie 'em down!
I told you we'd make it, Morg.
I told you we'd make it.
Everything's cool...
We made it, Morg.
I told you we'd make it.
I got him, sir, I got him.
Just let go, for Christ's sake.
Let go!
Let go of him, sir!
I got him!
Come on, goddamn it!
Let go of him,
for Christ's sake!
Let me out,
corpsman, come on!
I need some pressure in here!
Get him out of here, goddamn it!
Medic, come on!
Watch, watch the head.
Stand by!
Bring it in, bring it in,
bring it in! Move it!
Morg!
He's gone, man.
Come on, Jake.
Come on.
Oh, Jesus Christ, man.
It'll be all right, Jake.
It's going to be all right, man.
Jake, we don't want any more
of this if we can help it.
What altitude were you at
when McPherson got hit?
300, 500...
something like that.
I'd just taken a gun out
with a snake eye.
300 or 500?
It makes a difference.
I don't know.
I'm a little shaken up
right now.
You're what?
I said I'm shaken up, sir.
I got Morg's blood all over me.
Maybe we can stop the war
till things get better then.
Nobody asked you to stop
the war, did they?
Put McPherson's death
behind you, Mr. Grafton.
Right here, right now.
Yes, sir.
Now, what altitude
were you flying at?
Uh... 200.
200 maybe, AGL.
I pushed the nose over...
started a shallow...
dive in on the gun
and leveled out.
Some SAMs had tried us
when we'd come in,
and I wanted to... to get
out of there low and fast.
You came out
by a different route?
Yeah. Yes, sir.
About 30 miles, I guess.
Lucky small-arms fire.
Mmm.
All right.
Just bad luck, that's all.
Just ran out of luck.
Take Mr. Grafton
off the flight schedule.
You got liberty in Subic
in a couple days.
You need the rest.
What was your target?
A suspected truck park.
You hit it?
Oh, yeah, we hit it.
Trees.
A bunch of trees.
There was nothing there again.
What's your problem?
Spit it out.
Well, I don't think trees
in a suspected truck park
is worth a man's life.
Targets are picked for
political consideration,
Mr. Grafton,
with the best intelligence
we have available.
You have any trouble with that?
Well, I don't think losing Morg
is a political
consideration, sir.
Look...
I know losing
McPherson is lousy.
I don't like the targets,
either.
I hate them.
But... I don't want any
blood feuds going on.
Half the time,
it isn't the mission
you're flying
that kills you,
it's the one before--
do you read me?
Yes, sir.
Good.
I want you to write
a letter to Morg's wife.
I'll mail it in
a couple of days
along with one from me.
Help put this thing
behind you, okay?
Thanks, skipper.
For what?
You die, son, and
I'll piss on your grave.
Down here, down here.
Hey, Jake. Jake!
What the hell?
You're not thinking
about jumping are you?
No, not yet.
You need any help,
Mr. Grafton?
We thought you might want
to talk or something.
Oh, I'm fine.
Thanks, Chief.
So Jake, how'd you guys do?
I mean, you know,
before it happened.
Trees.
Yeah, trees?
Right.
-Again.
-Again?
Hey, Jack, you were
with a Marine detachment.
You ever
get used to it?
Yeah, I got used to it.
I'm a doc-- that's what I do.
Naw, nobody gets used to it.
You can put your job in front
of it like the skipper,
or you can even joke about it,
but nobody gets used to it.
That's right.
How about the old man?
Has he always been
like he is now?
When he chews you out?
Mm-hmm.
Maybe he figures he might not
get another chance.
Hey, guys, come on.
We got a squad room meeting,
okay, Jake?
All right, all right, all right.
I got all night, too.
I want to introduce
our new replacement pilot.
Mr. Barlow, up front.
Let's hear about your life.
Come on.
Yeah! Yeah!
Up front, up front,
up front, up front,
up front, up front,
up front...
All right.
All right, all right, shut up!
I'm Lieutenant J.G. Jack Barlow.
Sit down, asshole!
How old are you, son?
24, sir.
You look 12.
Did they teach you how to shave
at the Naval Academy?
I didn't think so.
Razor.
Ah, that's your new
name for now: Razor.
Excellent name, skipper.
Yeah!
All right, Walter.
Thank you.
All right, at, uh...
tomorrow at 1000
on the flight deck
there will be a memorial service
for McPherson.
The uniform is tropical,
white, long.
Oh, yeah, one other thing.
Uh, somebody close that door
back there, will you?
Frank?
Now, this matter
of the phantom shitter.
Now, I know it's a phenomenon
that occurs on a
carrier in combat
that goes back
to World War I l,
but this has gotten
out of hand.
Last night, the
phantom left a note
saying he would strike,
and this morning, a turd was
found in the XO's ashtray.
That only means
one thing, gentlemen.
It is no fighter jock
or recon puke
who is doing this thing.
It is an A-6 driver,
because no one else
on this ship
can hit the XO's ashtray.
Yeah!
Right, right, right.
Hup.
Someone,
in this room right here,
is the phantom shitter.
Now, it could be your roommate,
pilot, bombardier...
Think about it.
Movie officer.
Yes, sir.
What's the film for tonight?
Uh, They Shoot Horses,
Don't They?, sir.
It's Jane Fonda, sir.
Any skin?
No, sir.
Cancel it.
Yeah!
Dear Sharon,
By now you've been notified
that Morgan is gone.
He was killed over Vietnam
flying a night strike
and... I wish I could say
that his death was necessary,
but... it wasn't.
The target we were bombing
was nonexistent,
and the mission was useless.
Too many good men have died like
Morgan these past two years.
I guess I knew him as well
as any man could know another.
He was... he was my best friend.
I know how heavy a burden
his loss is to you
and little Bobby,
and... and I know
how much he loved you.
Somehow I wish
there was something,
just one thing I could do
to make up for such a loss
as Morgan.
I go on, as Tennyson said,
and the world darkens around me,
"among new men, strange faces"
and other minds.
You have my deepest
and most sincere sympathy.
Jake.
Real sorry about Mr. McPherson,
sir.
What's this?
Thought he was single.
He was.
He was four days ago.
You know this girl, Chief?
Yeah, she's a looker.
Probably first piece of ass
he's ever had.
When did you get married, son?
Last time in port, sir.
You know you got to have
Navy permission
to marry a foreign national?
Your folks know?
No, sir.
Do you love her?
Well, yes, sir,
of course I do, sir.
I-I got a picture of
her here in my wallet.
No, that's all right.
It's all right.
You violated a major
regulation, Hardesty,
but I'm going to sign
your chit.
You realize that you're legally
and morally obligated
to this girl.
Do you know that?
Yes, sir.
Do you understand
what that means?
You got to support her.
Yes, sir.
This aircraft
has not been cleaned!
Why hasn't this aircraft
been cleaned?
I'll clean it myself, sir.
I'll see that it's done.
You do that,
you get it done!
Get it clean!
Sorry, sir, l...
No, don't explain, son,
just get it done.
Mr. Grafton won't hold it
against you.
He's just upset.
It's just that nobody's ever
come back dead like that, sir.
Whole ship knows about it.
A lot of them come down
just to take a look
at it, but...
I don't know why we
didn't clean it, sir.
When people die,
they're just gone.
But not like this, sir.
All right, all right.
That's all right, son,
that's all right.
This is the enforcer.
Stand by to recover the call.
Mr. Cole!
How you doing?
I'm Chief Poole.
You come this way.
Commander Camparelli
is waiting for you
down in the ready room.
Hold on, Chief.
All right, sir.
I want to smell it.
I've been away for a while.
I'm ready.
All right, sir.
Mr. Cole.
Have a seat.
I'm fine, sir.
Uh...
I was on the Coral Sea,
when you were on the Ranger.
Is that so?
Knew a lot of guys
in VA-35.
Knew Jim Becker.
Flew A-4s with him.
You went down with him,
didn't you?
That's right, sir.
And he didn't make it.
No, sir, he didn't.
I know the whole story.
Before and after.
I know a lot about you.
Well, I'm glad, sir,
because I know a lot
about you, too.
Everybody in the Navy
knows about you, sir.
Yeah?
What about me?
That you're a legend, sir.
Then that makes two of us.
And sometimes that can
be a bad influence on others.
I'll try and fit in, sir.
That's my job.
Make sure you do that.
Good evening, Mr. Cole.
We'll have to try
Sector A tomorrow.
Finding out now...
Mr. Grafton.
I'm sorry about
Mr. McPherson, sir.
Is, uh, Guffy around?
You seen him?
Uh, yes, sir.
He's... he's right there.
You wanted to see me, Guffy?
Yeah, just a minute.
Let me ask you something, Guffy.
You suppose there's anything...
anything valuable here?
If they had something,
it'd be up north, wouldn't it?
That's right, Mr. Grafton.
You see this?
This is Haiphong Harbor.
It's loaded with munitions.
They take 'em out of here,
and they stick 'em here,
in Hanoi.
But it's not for you,
it's restricted.
They didn't do it in '65,
we haven't flown
over it since '69,
so don't even think about it.
But I do have something here
that's gonna
brighten your day.
You know that strike you flew in
the south last week?
Yeah, we refueled at Da Nang.
That one?
Yeah.
Army bomb damage assessment
says you killed 37.
That's some body count,
eh, buddy?
You think I want
to know that, huh?
If you did what I did,
would you want to know?
No, for all you know,
those people were farmers.
You get that information,
you keep it to yourself,
all right?
I don't want to know about it.
Just keep it to yourself.
Do you even know who I am?
Yes, sir, I do, sir!
You're Commander Camparelli,
sir, the C.O.!
What kind of name
is Camparelli?!
It is an ltalian-
American name.
Have you ever met a black man
with a name like that?
No, you haven't.
I got that name
because somewhere in my past
there was a wop
in the woodpile.
Do I detect a smile
on your disgusting face,
Lieutenant Razor?
I thought not.
So it turns out that my family
are third-generation Mafia.
They were forced to make
a living in gambling,
extortion and murder,
so that their boy
could fly a jet aircraft
for the U.S. Navy.
So I take what I do serious.
Do you understand me, son?
Yes, sir, I do, sir.
Then get out of my sight.
Lieutenant Razor, dismissed!
Ah-- don't laugh.
He's your new wingman.
Just take one.
I'll hand it to you.
That's the one
I want you to have.
There's a pair of A-6s
going to Subic tomorrow.
I want you take one
with the doc.
I'll put Grafton and maybe
Boxman in the other one.
As soon as you get
Jake off the deck,
you fly him dizzy,
get him drunk,
anything to wind him down
before he goes up in flames.
Yeah...
All that guy needs is a...
strike on the match.
All right, now listen, Doc.
Don't touch anything.
Keep your hands in your lap.
Absolutely.
The only exception
is if you have to eject.
Eject?
Now, you got a yellow
and black handle
here and one here--
you pull it.
The command will be
"eject, eject, eject."
Three times, you got it?
Yes, "eject, eject, eject."
Do I say roger or...
just do it or what?
You even say "huh," you'll
be talking to yourself...
'cause I'll be gone.
Jake!
Give me 15 degrees lift.
We should make Luzon
in about 15 minutes.
You're getting pretty good
at this, aren't you?
I watch my BN a lot.
I sort of picked it up.
If I'm wrong, I don't know...
China.
What do you think?
Huh?
Swell.
That's good food man, good food.
You're my favorite pilot, Jake.
Did you know that?
I thought you were
your favorite pilot.
Hey, Sammy, how you doing
out there, man?
You enjoying yourself?
How's the doc?
I think Mad Jack's asleep.
No, I'm not.
Hey, follow the leader.
What do you think, huh?
How much?
Talk to the man.
Oh, I don't know.
What do you say,
five bucks, hard cash?
Oh, you're on, Cool Hand.
This is going to be
the most exciting thing
you've ever done
with your clothes on, Doc.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, no.
Come on, Jake.
You can do better than this.
Now, I'm gonna have some fun.
Whoo!
Come on, Jake.
Doc's falling asleep here.
I'm getting a little
embarrassed.
Sammy, you're a dick!
Whoo! You can fly a plane, Jake!
Hey, Cool Hand.
Where are you guys?
Yee-hoo!
Here, Doc, take some oxygen.
You'll feel better...
Keep both hands on the wheel!
It's not funny!
Woo, yeah.
We're having some fun now,
aren't we, Morg?
It's not Morg, Cool Hand, okay?
It's me.
You take it easy?
You okay, huh?
Where are you guys?
That's all you get
for five dollars, okay, man?
We're gonna bring it in.
But are the girls clean?
Clean?
You afraid of a few bugs, son?
You afraid of disease?
What kind of aviator are you,
Razor, huh?
Well, who's on for Po City?
Checklist, yeah,
preflight, kid.
Money.
Yeah, yeah, I'm cool.
Prophylactics.
I've got two.
Oh, yeah?
I always carry 26, myself.
That's not a joke.
No shit, Razor.
It is the biggest cathouse
east of Port Said, man.
Whole town is dedicated.
Know what I mean?
You coming, Jake?
Cold beer, hot women...
Put the war in perspective.
Tell you what.
I think I'm going to
catch you guys later.
I've got something
to take care of.
Perspective.
Yeah.
Mr. Lieutenant?
Oh.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
I was looking
for Mrs. McPherson.
Sharon's gone.
Her husband was killed.
I know.
You're here on a duty call.
They send you here
to stroke the widow?
Who are you?
Callie Troy.
I'm helping pack their stuff.
The Navy pays me to help people
like Sharon.
What can I tell you,
Mr. Lieutenant?
They were here,
but now they're gone.
Like a lot people these days.
When you get in your airplane
and fly away alone,
sometimes you don't come back.
He wasn't alone.
And he did come back.
I was with him.
Commander Cole here
decided to join our posse, Jake.
This is Lieutenant
Jake Grafton--
"Cool Hand."
Glad to meet you, Jake.
How do you want
to be called, Commander?
Cole. Virgil Cole.
It's his third tour, man.
He really knows his shit.
You got the DFC and
the Silver Star, don't you?
Does it matter?
Hell, no, it doesn't matter,
Cole, Virgil Cole.
Here we are.
Home, sweet home.
Put on your wings, Jake.
You want to relax?
Hey, Jake!
Let's relax.
Ain't it great
to be home, Jake?
Some things
never change, right?
Thanks, Joe.
Hope you don't get the clap.
Give this man another beer
immediately.
Boxman, Boxman!
How are you?
Hey! All right!
When'd you get back?
Hey, Carrie, how's the baby?!
Looks just like you!
Carmen...
You didn't think
I was coming back, did you?
April, oh, my goodness,
you sweet thing.
You've been working
out, I can tell.
Come up here.
Some of them
are real dogs, Boxman.
They're all beautiful
after being with you chumps
for 57 days, right?
...gonna buy my baby
a diamond ring...
If that diamond ring
don't shine...
Get a fighter pilot to do it!
Are you a fighter pilot?
Don't ask a man
if he's a fighter pilot.
If he is,
he'll let you know.
If he isn't,
don't embarrass him.
Asshole...
Fighter-pukes make movies.
Yeah.
Bomber pilots make history.
Prove it, asshole.
Nice carrier landing!
I don't hear
your engines running!
And I don't see
your salute!
Launch the Intruder!.
Yeah! Yeah!
Bo Diddly, Bo Diddly,
have you heard?
How you doing?
Hey, flyboy...
I think you were lucky
and I lost money.
Do it again, boy.
You boys got a problem?
What's it to you?
What's it to you, nigger?
Hey, watch your mouth, mister.
You gonna stop me?
I got to go, man.
If the house is a-rockin',
don't bother knockin'
If the house is a-rockin'
Don't bother knockin'
If the house is a-rockin',
don't bother, come on in...
Watch out, Razor!
Nature calls.
Now, repeat after me.
Say, "Black is beautiful."
Hey, Jake, this place
is a drag, man, huh?
Let's go, come on.
Come on.
You get my hat?
I don't know.
I don't know!
I'm gonna throw you in, anyway.
Mess call!
Mess call!
Got room in here for a six pack
and a pizza?
Sure, sailor, okay.
Aw, man!
Shit.
I'm in shit, Morg.
Hey, Jake, hey, man.
It's the Boxman, okay?
Come on, Jake, come on.
If the house is a-rockin',
don't bother knockin'...
Come on, man!
Come on!
Oh, shore patrol!
Saved, man.
We're saved, Jake.
Emergency egress, gentlemen.
Cole, Virgil Cole,
let's go, man.
Hey, Box...
I, uh...
appreciate you getting me
out of there, man.
I know, l...
Hey, Jake, put it
down, man, okay?
Morg's gone.
Let him go.
Okay?
Have some coffee.
You going back?
Hey, my wingman Razor's
still out there... alone,
you know?
Hey...
Adios, compadre.
Thanks.
Cole.
Uh, hold on, Box.
You'll be all right,
Mr. Grafton.
I'm tactical.
I know this is foolish of me...
but I'm a little tipsy
and l, um...
I made a fool of myself earlier.
I... I was a real...
Slow down, slow down.
And I guess I owe you one.
Owe me one?
Yeah, l...
want to make it right by you.
What can I do?
Uh... okay.
Um... dance?
All right.
I want to jump, but
I'm afraid I'll fall
I want to holler,
but the joint's too small...
I make up
all my own moves!
Seems like it.
I got the rockin' pneumonia
and the boogie-woogie blues...
Yeah, I learned this
when I was a hippie!
I want to kiss her,
but she's way too tall
Young man rhythm's
got ahold of me, too
I got the rockin' pneumonia...
Tonight you're mine,
completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight, the light of love
is in your eyes
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Tomorrow...
Thank you.
Is, uh...
is that your daughter?
It's all right.
Where's her father?
He's scattered all over
North Vietnam.
He went out one day alone,
and the SAMs got him.
Since no one was with him
and his body
was never found,
they have him listed as MlA.
Of course, it isn't true.
You knew I was a pilot.
I married a pilot.
Didn't it make
you remember?
Maybe I wanted to remember.
Hardesty...
How's your wife?
She's fine.
She's fine, sir.
Really appreciate everything
you done for me, sir.
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Grafton.
Got a beautiful child, sir,
beautiful wife,
beautiful family.
Want to thank you again
for everything you done.
It's no trouble, Hardesty,
no trouble.
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Grafton.
"Beautiful family."
Callie, I know we don't want
to complicate things
any more than
we have to, but l...
I'd like to write to you,
if that'd be all right?
I'd like that.
It would be fine.
I'd like it very much.
Have you always been
this stupid?!
How did a person like you,
as stupid as you are,
become an aviator?!
Can you read?!
Are you that illiterate?!
This is no kindergarten!
This is no, no preschool!
Grafton!
Get in here.
You were part of this, too.
Sit down, both of you.
Now what's this crap
about you attempting
to feed a merchant seaman
to some alligators?
They were crocodiles, sir.
I don't give a damn.
Now go on.
Well, I attempted to throw
the aforementioned puke
to the crocodiles, sir,
when his belt caught on
the railing and I failed.
An altercation
then ensued, sir.
700 bucks damage,
30 men in the brig
and an alligator injured...
and you got away.
Using escape and evasion
techniques, sir,
I was able to avoid
being captured and, sir,
we didn't hurt that crocodile.
He was fine when we left.
Yeah, he was okay, skipper.
Damn it, stand up!
Who gave you permission
to sit down?
Who was with you?
I'd rather not say, sir.
That's the same thing he said.
Mr. Cole.
I couldn't help but overhear
the conversation,
and I thought
I might add something, sir.
Then go ahead, mister.
These men were victimized, sir.
"Victimized"?
Exactly, sir,
they were victimized.
We were lucky to escape.
I saw the whole thing.
Yes...
And I'm sure you'd let me know
if these gentlemen
were at fault.
That's affirmative, sir.
That'll be all, Mr. Cole.
Yes, sir.
All right.
All right,
I'll cover your asses--
both of you.
Because you told the truth,
and kept the faith.
But if I catch
either one of you
shitting in some
vital area on my ship,
you'll be keelhauled--
and that's serious
on an aircraft carrier.
Get out of here, Cool Hand.
Yes, sir.
As for you, Razor...
running with known
psychopaths now, huh?
Who am l, Razor?
You're third-generation
Mafia, sir.
Wrong!
You rodent.
I was built with this ship.
I am a weapons system,
and there was a cost overrun!
Dismissed!
Come on in.
Commander Cole.
Mr. Grafton.
Have you recovered yet?
Oh, yeah.
Uh, I saw the duty
roster out here,
and they've got us paired up.
Looks like you're
going to be my new BN.
I thought we may have
a chance to visit
for a minute.
What do you got on your mind?
Well, actually, sir,
I got the word that
this is your third tour,
and I was... I was curious.
What makes a man come back
for the third time?
I like to fight.
Have you had a lot of pilots?
Oh, four or five.
I'm kind of hard on pilots.
Have, uh...
you ever been up north?
Sure.
In the old days,
that's where the war was.
Boy, I bet... I bet
there was something up there
that really made the trip
worthwhile back then, huh?
I mean, I figure a guy like you
ought to know, huh?
There was a lot up there
worth it.
You know that.
SAMs are the scene here, man.
SAM sites are the most righteous
targets we got.
You ever fly lronhand?
No.
No, no.
No, not me.
I... I don't let them shoot
rockets at me for sport.
You get to kill them.
It's gratifying.
Yeah, but I bet
it's not as gratifying
as what was up north, huh?
I get your drift.
Don't even think about it.
Well, I just know
it's going to be a pleasure
to fly with you, Mr. Cole.
Hot dog.
Well, today's your lucky day.
The only A-6B qualified crew,
Jackson and Greeves,
were scrubbed because
they didn't have a day trap.
So your BN volunteered you
for SAM suppression.
Ever pull lronhand duty?
You fly the B?
No.
Wait a minute.
I'm not B qualified.
I've never even sat
in the damn thing.
Well, it's a good thing
Mr. Cole has.
Besides, you're all we got.
Whoa.
Do you know something
I don't know?
Maybe.
Maybe not.
Look, just relax.
I'll talk you through it.
I used to be an
instructor on the B.
The only difference is
a couple of black boxes,
and they're all mine.
So just... follow steering
and flow with it.
You see, lronhand's my thing.
It's simple.
We're the decoys.
We get them to turn their radar
on and shoot at us.
But then again,
we get to shoot back
and kill them
with our missiles.
That way, the bombers can have
a pleasant SAM-free evening
dropping their bombs.
When you shoot the shrike,
just remember not to look at it.
It'll blind you.
Otherwise, it's a simple deal.
When the SAM's radar goes on,
that's your target. You shoot.
They either have to shut off
and lose the missile
or eat the shrike.
Even if they do shut off,
sometimes the shrike remembers
where they're at.
Mean bastards, eh?
You know something?
I think that's the most I've
ever heard you say at one time.
Oh...
Look, man.
I hate SAMs.
I get all worked up
just thinking about them.
When I tell you to do something,
just make sure you do it.
Well...
I can tell this is going to be
a real love affair.
Break left.
All right, that's enough.
That's enough.
Just checking.
Devil 5-2-0, feet dry.
Roger, 5-2-0.
We copy, feet dry.
Good hunting, Cool Hand.
Let's let them know we're here.
Put your mask on,
it's going to be a gunfight.
Man, we've been made.
Give me 1 5 degrees, nose up.
A SAM just lifted off-- 1 :00.
Oh, Jesus,
there's another one!
It's not any fun until
they send up three at once.
Then we give the Gomers
our first rocket
while you dive under.
Oh, I do, do l?
Where do you get all this
confidence in my ability?
Now that's four.
Are you happy now?
Aim at the strobe.
Come on, come on.
They're going into high PRM.
Just a second.
Shoot, shoot.
Spread out, spread out left.
I told you not to look.
Hang a left and hit
the shaft, goddamn it.
Two more dead ahead.
Down.
Get your nose down!
Just another
flight-controlled radar.
Bullshit.
Look at that thread direction.
It's coming up behind us.
Maybe a conical missile scan.
That's no missile scan;
that's a MiG, baby.
Black Eagle,
this is Devil 5-2-0.
We got a bandit
crawling up our ass.
Get those F4s over here.
Expedite!
And I do mean expedite.
Now, let's get out of here.
Give me 20 degrees, nose up.
What are you, crazy, man?
That's a MiG.
We don't even have a gun.
No, but we got a shrike,
and that'll take care
of the radar site
that's guiding the sucker.
Come on, you crazy bastard.
Goddamn it, I'm going to shoot
before he gets it.
Not yet, not yet.
That's it.
Right there.
Close your eyes.
Shoot.
Righteous.
Drop your flares
and cut your heat signature.
Hard right.
Oh, God.
We got a flame out.
Engines just shut down.
We got to get power
for a restart.
Emergency generator on.
Okay, throttle up.
Here goes nothing.
A thousand feet and dropping.
You're decelerating.
Come on, come on.
Air speed 200 knots.
We're going to drop
Iike a rock at 180.
Well, then why don't you eject?
Screw it.
I came along for the ride.
Come on, you sucker, light up.
300.
Come on, baby.
250... 200.
Things are coming alive.
Yeah, we got restart.
Yeah, you beautiful, wonderful
little aerodynamic wonder, you.
Yeah!
Whoo! Flow with it, yeah!
This is X-Ray 201 and 2.
We have your bandit in tow.
He's ours, gentlemen.
Cavalry's on its way.
I've had enough fun.
Let's go home.
Wash the windows,
check the oil.
Hey, what happened
to you guys?
A couple of minutes back there
you didn't answer my calls.
Oh, that.
We had a MiG after us.
We did an engine shutdown
to throw him off.
In the middle of combat?
Whew.
Cool move.
Cool as a jewel.
That's bullshit.
I pulled back on the throttles
too much.
That was a major screw-up,
and you know it.
Well, don't worry.
It won't affect my decision.
Your what?
If you were a candy ass,
I'd ask for a new pilot,
but I figure you'll do.
Hey, Jake.
Hey, man.
Hey.
What you doing up here?
Ah, it's a good place to think.
Oh, yeah?
Me, too, huh.
I like the noise.
It's good, it's good.
What do you got there, Box?
Um...
It's just some mail,
you know, outgoing.
Is that all yours?
Well, yeah.
I got a lot of people
to write to, man.
This is only Post City,
actually.
These are my favorites.
These I like, too.
Now, wait a minute.
You had time for this
and for evaluation?
I got a lot
of responsibilities, man,
you know?
I'm a...
I'm a patriarch.
No, really.
A patriarch.
Yeah.
Want to hear something?
What do you got?
Hold on.
Wait till you hear this.
It's something else.
Listen to this.
Ready?
Yeah.
You hear that?
"Daddy."
No, no, no.
He said "daddy," man.
That's my son.
That's my son.
It's beautiful, huh?
That's your son?
How'd you know?
I don't know, and I don't
give a shit either.
He can be my son
if he wants to be.
Why not?
Sure he can. Yes.
Right? I mean,
she wants him to be.
So do l.
I mean, that's what's
important, right?
That's right,
that's what's important.
Right. Right.
What's she like?
She's butt ugly.
I mean, she's ugly,
but she's got a great body, man.
Well, you know...
You know, Jake,
I think I could love
an ugly woman.
I mean, you can trust her more.
The pretty ones...
they only care about
themselves, right?
Yeah.
Right? I mean,
you know what I mean.
Yeah, sure.
That's nice.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Thanks a lot, Jake.
Yeah. Thanks a lot, man.
All right.
I'll see you around.
All right.
Mr. Grafton.
You wouldn't happen
to have anything
on North Vietnam, would you?
Like what?
Oh, I don't know.
Anything with...
maybe some maps?
Try this Geographic.
The map's in the back.
Keep it quiet.
It's not supposed to circulate.
All right. Thanks.
You want to bomb Hanoi.
You realize I could have you
court-martialed
for even making the suggestion.
That's right.
You took a big risk.
Yes, I did.
Why do you want to do this?
I think you know why.
There's guys like Morgan...
they're dying every day,
every single day.
This war...
This war's not going to end.
You think it would matter?
One plane?
Yes, I do.
It would matter to me.
I think it would matter to Morg.
It'd matter to all the other
guys that had gotten bagged.
It would matter to you,
and you know it.
So, you think putting
a couple of snake eyes
in the middle of party
headquarters is the answer?
Well, I don't know
if it's the answer,
but I'll tell you what.
It's going to get their
attention, isn't it?
You'd be going
right downtown.
It'd be no piece of cake.
Yeah, but it would be worth it.
And this time it's not going
to be a bunch of trees.
It's not going to be
a road junction.
It's going to be a
mission, a real mission.
You think it would change
anything at the peace table?
I don't know.
It might.
No dice.
I've been in this war
too long
to listen to this
idealistic bullshit.
Ah...
Let me tell you, friend,
there's nothing up there
worth dying for.
No, let me tell you something.
You risk your life.
You risk your life every
mission, every stinking mission.
I do my job.
I do my job.
Don't worry.
I'm going to forget
we even talked about this.
Dear Callie,
Last night, l...
I talked to my new bombardier
about an idea I had,
but he told me...
he told me it was crazy.
Now I'm very confused.
I know that I have to do
something about Morg's death,
but I don't know what.
Tonight we go out again to bomb
another useless target.
I miss you and little Sally.
I'll write again soon.
Jake.
All right, Jakey.
Bring it up a little tighter.
Here we go again.
Another important road junction.
Probably a couple of goat paths.
Locking down,
ground lock on target.
Okay.
Drop and try it, Jake.
Hack.
Bombs away.
All right, they're off.
Anybody see any secondaries?
Anybody see any secondaries?
I didn't think so.
Okay.
Give me some altitude.
Let's level off at 3,000.
Right with you, Boxman.
Oh, shit.
We got SAMs at 1 :00.
Okay, they launched.
Anybody see anything?
I think I saw two.
They're under that cloud bank.
You see it, Jake?
Jake!
Hard right! Hard right!
Okay, there's one left.
Uh, it just shut the radar down.
Where is the sucker? Jesus!
It's starting again.
All right, listen to me,
Box: turn into it.
Where? I can't see it!
I can't see it!
I'm hit, Jake, I'm hit!
Oh, my God, Jake!
Get out! Eject!
Punch out! Punch out!
He's gone.
Grafton.
Grafton...
you still with us?
We all miss Boxman...
but he's gone, okay?
Gentlemen...
I'd like to introduce you
to Mr. Young and Mr. Reynolds.
They're the replacement
crew from Hubie.
So why don't you go ahead
and tell us a little bit
about yourselves.
Uh... I'm Lieutenant
Larry Young.
Shut up, asshole.
Well, we've got to name them.
Why don't we just call 'em
"new guys."
We used up all the good names.
Let's just call them "new guys."
New One, New Two.
Very good, Razor.
You just have such
a vivid imagination.
Movie officer,
what's the film tonight?
There's no movie,
sir, just news.
Okay, news in the ready room.
There will be a memorial service
for Box and Letto
at 1 000 tomorrow.
Dress is tropical white, long.
That'll be all.
A Swiss camera crew
in Hanoi, North Vietnam,
took this footage
of a celebration of sorts,
commemorating the defeat
of American air pirates.
Here in
People's Resistance Park,
they've set up trophies
of their victories:
grim reminders of the losses
taken in this seven-year-old war
over the North.
I'll do it.
I'll go downtown with you.
But first I want you to know
something about me.
I had a pilot
by the name of Jim Becker.
He was a good man.
We made an agreement
that if we ever went down,
one of us got hurt,
that the other guy would go on.
A SAM took us out.
We were down on the ground
for days,
sneaking around, eating bugs,
living in holes that we dug.
On the sixth day,
Becker stepped on a mine
and blew half his leg off.
I tied it off, and
he told me to go on.
I got about a half mile away...
and I couldn't do it.
But by the time
I got back to him,
they had already found him
and killed him.
I saw it happen.
I just thought you
ought to know that...
the skipper and a lot of guys
think I just left him there.
I don't think
you left him there.
All right.
All right.
Forget your party headquarters.
Did you see those trucks,
those fins behind the
display on the news?
Well, yeah,
l-I think I did.
Did you ever hear of SAM City?
Well, I'll tell you, I've heard
a lot of stories about SAM City,
but I never...
They're true.
You just saw it.
It's no story.
It's real.
The air force photographs
them every day.
You're shitting me.
No.
Well, then there's got to be
data on it somewhere.
Honey, we aren't
in the air force.
I saw a picture of People's
Resistance Park in here,
but there's no reference
to it on the map.
It's there.
It's there, Jake.
How can it be?
I haven't seen it on the map.
I was there!.
I've seen it: SAM City.
They take 'em out of there,
and they fire 'em at us.
Now, if we could get
a couple of bombs in there,
set off some
of those warheads...
The whole place would blow.
A lot of guys' names
on those missiles.
You tell me you're interested
in payback.
That might be worth
a court-martial.
What do you think?
I think we should have
another look at that tape.
Hey, man,
what are you doing up?
You should be in the sack.
You got an alpha strike
tomorrow.
Oh, I couldn't sleep.
I'm walking it off.
Watch out,
skipper's on the prowl.
Shitter posted a strike.
Said he's going to piss.
That doubles his capabilities.
It's getting very dangerous.
He could hit anywhere.
Steam irons,
after-shave bottles...
Just think of
the targets available.
What are you doing up?
Don't lose sleep over it,
Grafton.
The price of peace
is eternal vigilance.
That's it.
God, look at those mothers.
Rows and rows of them.
If we just knew where that was.
People's Resistance Park,
Park of the People.
It's there somewhere.
So that's the Land of Oz.
Need some help?
No.
Red River, Paul Doumier Bridge.
Then you follow the main
boulevard, you go right to it.
People's Resistance Park.
It's right across the square
from the national assembly.
SAM City, man.
You guys must be nuts.
The air force won't give me
any pictures of downtown.
I'd have to send for 'em.
That would be like
robbing a bank
and using your own car
for the getaway.
But you follow the boulevard,
you go right to it,
but I did not tell you.
I did not tell you, man.
You know what this is?
It's the yellow brick road.
In three nights
we hit the power plant
at Bac Yang.
We'll be carrying
thousand-pound snake eyes
instead of 500s.
That's right.
When we drop them,
we drop them retarded.
I'll bet we can get really low--
maybe even 200 feet.
We can use two
on the power plant,
and that leaves us
eight for SAM City.
We're never going to get
another chance like this.
You guys are crazy, man.
You're never going
to frigging make it.
Yeah!
I get good vibes.
Well, it looks like
we got lndian country ahead.
We are coasting.
Black Eagle,
Devil 5-0-5-- feet dry.
Roger, 5-0-5.
Good hunting, gentlemen.
Initial point...
new heading, 2-8-7.
Okay, as soon as we
come out of this,
keep your eyes peeled
for that power plant.
400 feet.
Okay, I see it.
On target and into attack.
Here she comes, five miles out.
Ground lock, ten seconds.
Hold it.
Your pickle's hot.
Hack.
Bombs away.
Your new vector is 0-2-0
degrees, heading north.
0-2-0.
You have anybody you want
to say good-bye to?
Oh, maybe just a girl
and her kid.
But they hardly knew me.
How about you?
I used up my good-byes.
Let's do it.
200 feet.
Level at 200.
Hot dog.
Five miles to target.
Okay.
There she is.
I see it.
It's too quiet.
Where's the goddamn flak?
Don't worry about it.
Gomers can't get us now.
Nothing's going to get us now.
Jesus Christ.
Flow with it.
Damn, we're going to have to go
right through this crap.
Into attack, pickle's hot.
Aah!
Velocities have gone bananas.
It's either
the navigational system
or the computer.
The manual says
to kick the son of a bitch.
Get the rotors going.
"State of the art."
It's gone.
We're going to have to bomb
by hand.
I think I got it.
Left five.
We're at the initial point.
come hard left.
Okay, I've got
the yellow brick road in sight.
Jesus, what a great target.
Steady, now.
God, a SAM just lifted off!
Ahead right.
Hold it.
Come on, do it! Do it!
Hack.
Bomb's away, breaking left.
Holy shit!
Get it out! Get it out!
You're in the clear.
You all right?
Did we hit it?
I don't think so.
Yeah, but you had a lock
on it, didn't you?
Affirmative.
And the bombs fused.
Absolutely.
Well, then, why not?
Because they didn't drop!
You're kidding me.
All that jinking around must
have thrown off the ACU.
They'd never expect us
to come back.
Nobody'd go through that again.
Tell you what.
I came here to bomb.
Come hard left.
Heading 1 80.
1 -8-0, one more time.
Check the ACU
circuit breakers.
Armament circuit
breakers back in.
Maintain 300 feet.
300 feet.
We're at Jet B.
Hard left.
Get it on.
Though I walk
through the valley...
Three miles to target.
Right, two degrees.
I shall fear no evil...
Get it on.
For Thou art with me.
Thy rod and thy staff...
Pickle's hot.
-Stand by.
-Comfort me.
One mile-- keep on trucking.
Stand by.
Hack.
They're off!
Breaking left!
Breaking left!
Payback, you mother!
-Get down!
-Direct hit!
Listen to the music
of the traffic in the city
Linger on the sidewalk where the
neon lights are pretty
How can you lose?
The lights are
much brighter there
You can forget
all your troubles
Forget all your cares
And go downtown!
This further dramatizes
the reasons for withdrawal
from the peace negotiations
in Paris.
The only damage was a direct hit
to a children's hospital,
Ieaving hundreds
of innocent infants dead.
French journalist from Hanoi,
about an hour ago.
You were over Hanoi,
weren't you?
It was a good mission, sir.
Sir, we blew the shit
out of them,
but didn't come near
any hospital.
You think I don't know that?
I know what you hit.
The air force knows
what you hit.
So does CTF 77,
so does General Giap
and the entire
World Communist Union.
But no one's
going to admit it.
So far as this navy's concerned,
you didn't kill a rat!
Face forward, mister.
I'm just starting.
Where do you get off, mister?
Are you special?
You're just
a sensitive fella here.
I'd like to take you home
to my mama.
And as for you,
you can lead the Manson family
now that Charlie's in jail.
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?
You're a maniac.
They ought to study you, Cole.
Are there times
when you have the
moral obligation
not to follow orders?
Of course there are.
The navy didn't tell you
to strafe women and children
or do anything that violated
your conscience.
But, you heroes,
you do not have the right
to make up your own orders!
You have abused my trust
and the trust of every officer
in this squadron!
You'll be confined to your
quarters until tomorrow morning,
when you will accompany me
on the cod to Subic Bay
for inquiry into
court-martial charges.
Get out my sight.
Dismissed.
Be seated.
I hope you realize that now
is the time to come to Jesus.
Anyone giving me less than
100% proof will find himself
in a place like Adack, Alaska,
or Diego Garcia.
You will be there
awaiting court-martial
or resignation processing.
It will take
three to four years
to process a resignation.
Do I make myself clear?
All right, what about it,
Mr. Grafton?
There was only one mission, sir.
That right, Mr. Cole?
That's about the size of it.
We did it ourselves.
Normally, I'm blabby,
but I sat on this one.
You took an oath, Mr. Cole.
You, too, Mr. Grafton.
You took an oath
to defend the constitution
and obey the orders of
the officers appointed over you.
It's the same oath that every
officer in the navy has taken
for damn near 200 years.
And during all that time,
the military has
obeyed the civilians
over the elected government.
Now, they might not
have always been right
or wise or even smart,
but they were elected.
Any other way, and the United
States would be nothing more
than another two-bit
military dictatorship.
Why did you do this, Cole?
An officer
with your fine record?
Did you think you were going
to win the war?
Frankly, sir, I think
we're going to lose this one.
But I do love the work.
Mr. Cole, you may find
that amusing, but we don't.
Gentlemen, this is our country
you're messing with.
Well, Mr. Grafton, you have
an attentive audience here.
Perhaps you can explain to us
why you thought a one-plane war
was the way to go.
Well, sir, we bomb worthless
targets night after night--
I mean, three tents
under a tree...
sampan repair yards that have
been hit ten times already.
Sir, you know the list
better than I do.
My first bombardier and 50,000
other Americans are dead and...
can anyone tell me why?
I realize that
I'm Lieutenant Nobody.
I'm... I'm not really sure
about anything anymore.
This war's become
very confusing.
Nobody... nobody wants
to fight in it.
Nobody seems to want to win it.
Maybe it never should
have happened,
but people do die in it.
Maybe for me, it got personal,
because I do know the difference
between dying for something
and dying for nothing.
I know that's no excuse.
I... I know that.
And I broke the faith,
and for that, I am truly wrong.
Perhaps I should hang.
Hanging, Mr. Grafton,
is no longer a
punishment much in use.
But a prison term
in Leavenworth is,
or a dishonorable discharge
if a court-martial
should so decide.
But whatever happens,
I think it's safe to say
that your career
in the navy is over.
The only question's how.
Well, hell, I guess...
I guess I got you
into this, didn't l?
I don't see it that way.
Well, it was my fight
and my fault.
It was just your idea.
It was my choice.
Nobody tells me what to do.
That's part of the reason
these human Dobermans
are watching me.
Look, Jake,
I've never trusted anybody.
I've never counted on anybody
but myself.
But I'll tell you,
nobody has a chance alone.
I'm glad we did this together.
We never broke the faith, amigo.
If we hang or go to jail,
we do it together.
Hell...
I wouldn't have missed it
for the world.
What we're going to tell you,
Commander,
may come as a surprise,
but it must be held
in the utmost secrecy,
and its importance
will become obvious.
I think you'll understand.
All charges against your
boys have been dropped.
Sir?
They're gone.
Dropped.
Never happened.
What do you want me
to do, Captain?
Cover it up,
sweep it under the rug.
Take your men back
to your carrier
first thing in the morning,
keep their mouths shut.
Beyond that, you can do
what you want to with them,
but this affair's over.
May I ask the captain, why?
Because the President
of the United States,
Richard M. Nixon,
is quite irritated
at the opposition
for leaving the peace table.
He has just ordered
Operation Linebacker ll--
the unrestricted bombing
of all military targets
in North Vietnam.
We'd look like real idiots
court-martialing an A-6 crew
for doing what the President
of the United States
just told us to do.
If even a rumor got
back to the press,
you can understand
the ramifications.
Yes.
Yes, sir.
I want you out of my squadron.
You'll be transferred out
at my convenience.
Wait a minute!
Good men die,
and all we care about is
following the rules, huh?
What are you looking for,
Grafton?
Revenge?
Now, this is not
the place for it.
You're going to shake
your fist at God
and say, "Give me revenge"?
Well, He ain't listening.
You know what's
going on back home.
Bombs, riots, people spitting
on soldiers in airports.
The whole country is
tearing itself apart.
Is there anything in this
pissant war worth that?
Christ, all we really got
is each other.
I want you to think
about that
while we're out there
this morning, Mr. Grafton.
This is a daylight raid,
gentlemen.
Air force, marines, navy,
everything we got.
They've had three years
to get ready for us.
The most formidable
air defenses
in the history of warfare.
Our job, the task of the
lntruder, is to kill SAMs.
Make no mistake about it,
gentlemen,
SAMs are where
your ordnance goes.
Otherwise, those B-52s
will be dead meat.
We can expect a forest of SAMs
and flak you can lay down on.
We've got to cut a path through
for the air force.
We'll be going
in broad daylight
with nothing to hide behind.
We'll be easy targets
up there, gentlemen,
but they're counting on us.
Lean into it.
Let's go downtown!
Yeah!
All right!
This is Nomad Leader
on the mail.
Give me the coordinates.
Three-wheel painted Mustang,
suggest you orbit at 8,000.
You'll be good bait.
Devil 5-1 1, stay close
and move when I tell you.
That's a roger, Devil Leader.
Devil Leader, this is 5-0-3.
We're five miles behind you.
Skipper, you ever been
afraid of dying?
Son, you got to have
permission to die,
and I'll tell you when that is.
Got that one site--
it's a gun down there.
B issue 23.
He's got me painted.
I'm bracketed.
Okay, break right.
Oh, shit, I'm hit.
I'm hit.
5-1 1 to Devil Leader.
You're smoking, Devil Leader.
Get out, sir.
My BN is dead.
I'm getting out of here.
My canopy's stuck.
Damn it.
I can't eject.
Get out, sir, get out.
I'm taking her down.
I've got a clearing ahead
and a road.
I think I can make it.
Level your wings-- easy, boss.
I'm right behind you.
You can do it, sir.
Devil Leader off the screen.
Do you have a visual?
He's down.
Devil Leader down on the road.
I see the aircraft--
it's smoking.
We need a rescue team.
I've got a Jolly Green
standing by, but he's unarmed.
We need prop-driven planes
in here.
Send in the Sandies.
They can get in low,
under that ZSU.
I'm right behind you, 5-1 1.
Going down for a look.
There's a gun down there, 5-0-3.
Well, how else are we
going to find it?
I found it, 5-1 1.
This place is crawling with NVA.
We've been hit, fans,
we've been hit.
Call it in, Sammy.
Call it in.
Black Eagle, Black Eagle,
this is Devil 5-0-3.
My primary hydraulics are gone.
I'm losing fuel.
I think I can make feet wet,
easy.
Skipper, do you read me?
Skipper, come in.
Skipper, do you read me?
Do you read me?
Black Eagle,
I can't raise the skipper.
This is 5-1 1.
Going down to take a look.
Devil Leader, this is 5-1 1.
Come in, skipper.
Stay high, 5-1 1.
Those guns are still out there
just waiting for more game.
They must think
I've got a missile,
because they won't turn on
their radar, chicken shits.
We have bingo fuel.
Can it.
We're staying.
I'm not leaving the skipper
out here alone.
I heard that, Razor.
You do nothing of the kind.
You're going to be naked
out here without us, sir.
You get your young ass back
and rearm.
No way, sir, we're staying.
That's an order.
You hear me?
Yes, sir.
We have a pickup for fuel.
Make a ready deck,
make a ready deck.
0-3-5...
Hey, one more thing.
I'm changing your name
to Straight Razor.
Yeah.
You've become
a real weapon, son.
Yes, sir.
It's Grafton and Cole, sir.
Aren't they supposed
to be grounded?
I see a strike
preparing to launch.
Yeah!
Hang in there, Devil Leader.
We got you covered.
Listen up, you criminals.
That gun is still down here,
and there may be more.
Okay, here he is, I see him.
Going into bombs.
I'm going to shove it
down his throat.
They're off!
Ah, you ever eject?
Not my trip, man--
I didn't like it.
Keep on rolling the dice.
Ah, shit, we're on fire.
We're going to have to
bail out over Camparelli.
Not yet!
God, I was hoping I was never
going to have to do this.
This is the end of Devil 5-0-5.
Say goodbye, asshole.
Eject, eject, eject.
Good-bye, asshole.
Hi.
Ow!
Damn, it's broken.
Watch your big feet.
Shit.
You think
this changes anything...
you hoodlum?
Yeah, you disobeyed orders
again.
I grounded you.
Hey.
I am on the ground.
Aw, you're funny, cute.
Virgil, Virgil, do you copy?
Virgil, this is Jake.
Do you read me?
Cole, where are you, buddy?
Son of a bitch,
I'm going to get him.
What can we do, huh?
Huh? What can you do?!
I got to do something!
What can you do, huh?
Hey, you don't know
if he's dead.
You don't know where he is.
-Let me go.
-Sit still!
Virgil, where are you, buddy?
Virgil, Virgil, do you copy?
Virgil, this is Jake.
Do you read me?
Virgil?
Tell me where you are, man.
I'll come get you.
Calm down, buddy.
I had to split, man.
It was a bad scene for a while,
but everything's cool now.
How's the skipper?
He's with me.
Man, listen up.
Tell me where you are.
Tell me where you are.
All right, buddy?
Don't worry about me, man.
I got my face painted and
bushes tied all around me.
Them mothers are going
to have to step on me
to know where I am.
I don't believe him.
Before they...
Get down there.
Cole, you listen to me.
They're going to bomb your ass
if you don't come out,
goddamn it.
I'm out of here, man.
They'll never catch me.
Sandy Lead, this is Cole, 5-0-5.
Strafe where you can see
and expedite.
Right away, man.
Virgil, I'm going to come in
and get you, you asshole!
Get back here!
Grafton, get back here!
Grafton!
See, Cool Hand, you stupid ass.
I told you to stay down.
They got you pinned, man.
You want to get killed?
Now crawl back to the skipper.
Now... do it.
Sandy Low Lead, Sandy Low Lead,
this is Cole, 5-0-5.
Go ahead, 5-0-5.
I'm done, Sandy.
I'm all screwed up.
My back's broken.
They're everywhere.
I'm sitting on a ZSU.
They're using me for bait.
Don't do it!
Don't you do this to me!
Don't give up on me!
We're not going anywhere
without you!
Do it, Sandy.
Lay it in on me, man.
I'm popping smoke.
Virgil!
Virgil!
Do it, Sandy.
Do it now.
I'd do it for you.
That's a rog, 5-0-5.
Alpha, Mike, Foxtrot.
No... no.
Virgil!
Virgil.
Come on.
I know you didn't want
to lose another one, okay?
Now, come on.
I didn't either.
It hurts.
Come on, we got to go.
Get out of there, 5-0-5.
We're marking with Willy Pete
for a napalm run.
Come on,
let's get out of here.
Come on.
Come on.
This is Devil 5-0-5.
Does anyone read?
Devil 5-0-5, this is Rover.
What's your Charlie Sierra?
Over.
Jesus!
Sandy, clear out
this ground fire!
Devil 5-0-5, this is Rover--
Do you read?
You're all right.
Oh, shit.
Oh, leave me here.
Aw, shit.
You got a chance alone.
Get going, Grafton, now!
Devil 5-0-5, this is Rover.
If you read, pop smoke.
Rover, this is Grafton 5-0-5.
I'm popping smoke.
I want you to drop
the Penetrator in.
It's over, goddamn it.
What do you think
you're doing, huh?
I'm taking you
out of here, sir.
Wasn't it you who told me
it takes more to live?
Well, you're going to live!
All right, asshole.
Hey, we both go, or nobody goes.
Hey!
There's a guy out there,
and he's looking for a target.
He's going to have
to show himself.
I got to get him,
or you're never going
to make admiral.
Who do you think
you are, Wyatt Earp?
Flow with it, sir.
What?
He's still down there--
send it down.
Put it down.
We're getting low on fuel.
Rover, this is Sandy.
Clear out of there--
clear out.
Up, up.
Up!
Get him up!
Yeah!
Come on.
Bring him in.
All right.
Okay, Sandy,
we're getting out of here.
Cover us.
That's a rog, Rover.
That hand better, Mr. Grafton?
Oh, yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Letter from home?
Well, sort of.
This is your home, Mr. Grafton.
You're a lifer, like me,
Cole and the others.
When I was young,
I didn't even have a home--
just a ship.
So now when we go back,
it's just like
I'm only visiting.
Well, sir, they tell me
that you've been selected early
for captain.
They're going to give you
a ship like this, sir.
They're going to give you
a carrier.
And you know something, sir?
I wouldn't be surprised
if you make admiral.
You ever seen a black man
who's an admiral?
Third-generation Mafia, sir.
That's right, Grafton.
That's right.
I hope I'm on that ship, sir.
I do, too, Mr. Grafton.
I wouldn't have it
any other way.
