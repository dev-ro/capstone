So, settle?
I think that would be
excellent lawyering on your part.
What do you think about
90 cents on the dollar?
Jack? 90 cents on the dollar?
I think that"s fair.
Let"s do this after lunch, okay?
So, how long has it been?
Seventeen years.
Hello.
Isuppose you"re married now?
Eight years.
Four years to the first wife,
three to the second wife...
...and this one, a year so far.
How about you?
I married soon after we broke up.
Really?
Any kids?
No...not for me.
And you?
Yeah, I have a son, Scott. He"s 16.
He"s yours.
ls that a joke?
No, he"s your son.
My son?
I just never said anything
because by the time...
...I found out I was pregnant
we had broken up and...
...I was in love with Bob, my husband.
I married him and...
...he thinks Scott is his.
How do you know he isn"t?
Well, I know.
I know.
I did the math.
Not to demean your math skills,
but we should do this the right way.
Blood test, DNA.
Why are you telling me now,
after alI this time, by the way?
Scott ran away two weeks ago. Bob....
The husband?
Scott and Bob had a terrible fight.
Bob kept saying he"d be back but...
...it"s been two weeks and we haven"t....
Do you have any idea where he went?
No.
He ran away with a girI he was seeing,
Nikki Trainor.
Her parents are divorced.
Her father lives in San Francisco.
He works in a towing service,
Tip Top Towing.
Tip Top Towing?
When we called, he wouldn"t speak to us.
He wouldn"t even speak to the police.
Do you have a picture?
Of Scotty?
You can see the resemblance, right?
lt"s the wrong expression.
When he smiles, he"s you.
Do you have a picture of him smiling?
l"m sorry. l"d....
I wish I could do something, anything.
-You can find him.
-Me?
I don"t find people. I sue them.
""To whom it may concern:
""For years l"ve thought
about killing myself.
""lt"s the only thing that"s kept me going.
""But something always held me back.
""My writing. ""
Good-bye...
...my life"s work.
Au revoir, æuvre.
Ciao, caca.
Two bullets should be enough.
Hello.
Who"s this?
Collette.
Collette Richard?
My God, how are you?
Me?
l"m not bad.
Tomorrow?
You know, I made no plans.
lt"s one face.
I have a son.
l"m okay.
Just telI me about Scotty.
When can I see him?
Scott is missing.
My son is missing?
We think he"s up here.
Here, in San Francisco?
You live here, and are understanding--
Oh, psychic sometimes.
But you have a fulI plate.
I know I seem a little...
...fuzzy...
...but I can focus.
Let me try this.
I can do it.
My son needs me.
Don"t worry, Scotty.
Daddy"s coming.
Why didn"t someone calI me
before I left L.A.?
Because we didn"t know.
My client showed up 20 minutes ago,
then said his cast was too tight...
...and he was in terrible pain.
-Terrible pain.
-lt"s true.
He"lI be okay tomorrow.
-But I am here today.
-I know. l"m sorry.
Rose wilI book you into a hotel.
Where do you want to stay?
My house, but it"s in Los Angeles.
Hello.
Hi, honey.
What"s wrong?
We had a little problem.
I have to stay over.
l"m sorry.
You"lI be okay?
l"lI be fine. l"m taking care
of stuff around the house.
l"lI calI you later.
Okay, bye.
Let"s see.
Do you have a phone book?
Hi, Scott.
l"m your dad.
Hi, Scotty.
Oh! Good, firm handshake.
Scotty, how you doing?
Dude...
...l"m your old man.
I suppose you"re wondering
why your middle name is Rainbow.
What"s up, homes?
You know, Scott,
when I was a boy your age...
...I was pulling on myself harder
than a tractor-pull.
l"m your papa, your daddy, your père.
You got to care for me, you see.
I am your father.
Hug me and let us join our spirits.
Mr. Trainor?
-My name is Jack Lawrence.
-So?
I was hoping maybe you could
help me with something.
Have you seen this boy?
Christ, again. Who are you?
l"m his father.
Why are you bothering me?
I talked to your wife.
No, she"s not my wife. She is....
That"s not even the point.
The point is, I don"t know anything.
So get lost.
When did you last see him?
Look....
l"m tired of this bullshit.
Just get out of here.
-l"lI get it.
-Give me that.
No, he"s in a meeting right now.
What"s wrong with you?
Hello?
He can"t speak right now.
He"s having trouble with his testicles.
l"lI telI him.
That was your mother, on the phone.
Come on.
You"lI be okay.
Sit down. AlI right.
Okay. Come on.
Everything"s going to be okay.
What were we talking about?
Right, right, your daughter and my son.
They were here with other kids.
Good. Good. And...?
And now they"re gone.
And where did they go?
Nikki said something about trying
to get money from my ex-wife.
And she would be...?
The lady that runs the Marina in Tiberon.
What"s her name, Bosco?
Shirley.
-Shirley"s Marina.
-ln Tiberon.
Thank you very, very much.
Excuse me, Mr. Trainor?
That"s not me. He"s in there.
Jesus.
Can I get a cab outside?
Nice shot.
Mr. Trainor?
I hope l"m not catching you
at an inconvenient moment.
I won"t waste an extra minute
of your time.
Have you seen this handsome boy?
Who are you?
lsn"t it obvious?
l"m his father.
I understand he and your daughter
are an item.
They grow up so fast, don"t they?
One minute they"re going,
""Who"s the little boy?""
And the next minute
he"s banging your little girl.
May I sit down?
Thank you.
So how many fathers does this kid have?
I see. No, the man you met
is not the reaI father.
l"m the reaI father.
lt"s a long story.
Seventeen years ago,
we were biking through the wine--
His mother and I were biking
through the wine country.
Please, you answer the phone.
l"lI finish my story later.
-What?
-Get out of here!
-What"s that alI about?
-Get out of here!
My God!
That man is insane!
He bludgeoned me for no reason!
-He"s a bad guy. You"re okay?
-I don"t know.
ls there blood?
Good.
I was telling him a story about me
and a girI biking through the wine--
Those stories aren"t for everybody.
I guess not.
I have to talk to him.
l"m trying to find my son.
Your son?
He ran away.
Your son ran away?
So did mine.
How richly bizarre.
They could be together.
-You think so?
-He said there"s a group of them.
Dale Putley.
Jack Lawrence.
Do you know where Tiberon is?
Dale, I feeI like l"m in a white Bronco.
l"m sorry, ljust get anxious
driving over bridges.
You"re going 11 miles an hour.
-l"m going 25 miles an hour.
-I can feeI the G-force.
What? What?
-Calm down.
-l"m okay. lt"s just alI these people.
I don"t like a lot of people or a lot of cars.
What do you do for living?
I teach English as a third language
at the Jewish Community Center.
Excuse me!
l"m really sort of a...
...writer at large.
I write and perform poetry and plays.
Things from my soul.
But it"s avant-garde. Very experimental.
You mean with guinea pigs and...?
You"re not a mime, are you?
I used to be.
You did? Well, l"m sorry.
-For what?
-Nothing.
No, no, telI me. lt"s okay. I can....
I hate them.
I see a mime on the street,
I want to kick him in the face.
-Really?
-I do.
You should talk to someone about it.
-They"re annoying.
-Really?
I go out shopping, he"s got a balloon.
What do you do?
I just want to smack him.
What do I do? l"m a lawyer.
Bloodsucker.
l"m sorry, I didn"t hear you.
Throat.
Sorry.
-You missed the exit.
-I what?
AlI of this pithy conversation
and we missed the exit.
You"re gonna have to go off
and come back around.
What"re you doing?
-What was that?
-l"m sorry.
I turn around and you blacked out!
ln crisis situations,
I have these anxiety attacks.
I hyperventilate and pass out
for a moment.
l"m sorry, Jack.
l"m back.
Have you been driving long?
About 30 years.
These things take time. PulI in here.
Brake, brake, brake.
Perfect.
Anchovies. I gave you the shrimp
and here are worms.
Have a good time. Catch some fish.
Mrs. Trainor?
My name is Jack Lawrence.
Can I talk to you for a moment?
Listen, Pepe, don"t start on that
untiI I get over there.
l"m Dale Putley.
Fine. What do you want?
lt"s about Nikki.
Your ex-husband told us to talk to you.
What"d she do now?
We"re not looking for Nikki,
we"re trying to find our two boys.
We think they"re in
your daughter"s sociaI circle.
Listen, I don"t know where Nikki is.
Frankly...
...I don"t want to know.
How"d you get her husband to talk?
I head-butted him in the face.
How Joe Pesci of you.
You"lI run her tits through
the VlSA machine?
Hey, listen.
How about crying again?
Me?
lt might reach her maternal...thing.
Cry, just like that?
You cried missing the exit.
-Don"t mock me.
-Listen, Chip.
You"re an actor.
Let"s pretend it"s a play.
A very sad play. A tragic play.
You"re a tragic hero.
You"re Lou Gehrig.
Who"s that?
Lou Gehrig.
The basebalI player.
He died of Lou Gehrig"s disease.
What are the odds on that?
Here"s what I need:
I need tears, and quickly.
She wilI come back.
l"lI try.
Do it.
Must find something from my past.
Go ahead.
ln the actor"s studio,
they calI it sense memory.
Come on.
That"s fantastic. That"s great.
-What are you doing?
-l"m okay.
What are you doing?
l"m at my grandmother"s funeral.
Sorry I wasn"t there.
lt was great.
Cut it out. She"s here.
Why are you stilI here?
What"s wrong with him?
He"s upset.
He"s distraught.
ls he crying?
Crying? He"s weeping.
Why?
Why?
lt"s his son.
His son is his whole life.
We come here, looking for help...
...and you crush his last hope
of ever finding him again.
-My boy! My boy!
-I don"t know.
You"re ripping his heart out.
My daughter could get into trouble.
We"lI keep it private.
ln the family.
-From one parent to another.
-To another.
They"re probably with Sugar Ray.
The boxer?
lt"s a rock band.
Nikki and some other kids
traveI following them around.
-Are they playing in San Francisco?
-Where are they playing?
They were. Nikki came over
a few days ago...
...and said she was going to Sacramento.
They"re playing at a club called...
...the Temple.
The Temple?
ln Sacramento. Sugar Ray.
Thank you very, very much.
You"re welcome.
lf you see Nikki...
...telI her to calI me if she needs anything.
I want to share with you
a line from one of my...
...unproduced plays.
""The amazing thing about a parent"s love
is that something so large...
""...can so often go unseen.""
-That"s beautiful.
-Thank you.
What do your sons look like?
lf they were with Nikki I probably
met them. Do you have a photo?
I do.
I have a picture.
I did.
There he is.
He"s handsome.
This is mine.
What is this, a joke?
That bitch!
Guess who?
That"s right. Guess where I am.
No, l"m in San Francisco.
And guess who l"m with.
Oh, God.
l"lI give you a hint.
Don"t do that!
She got it in a second.
What the hell"s going on?
How could you telI us both
the same story?
l"m so hurt!
lt"s not a story.
Who is the father? ls it me, Bob or...
...Dale?
The truth is, I don"t know.
I knew alI three of you then.
Any of you could be.
Please, just find him.
Find him and we can settle it later.
That really helps.
What"d she say?
She said she"s not sure.
You don"t know who Scott"s father is?
When did you meet her?
At a basebalI game.
You?
Up here at Berkeley.
Oh, Collette....
That accent.
The mouth.
She was just so....
Stimulating.
First date...
...I just stared at her the whole night,
she was so stunning in the moon light.
I didn"t even touch her.
I took nude photographs of her.
She posed nude for you?
lt was photography class. Sextra credit.
AlI she ever did for me was have sex.
We did that too,
but l"ve got some negatives.
lt was Berkeley, you know.
I took nude pictures of her,
she took nude pictures of me.
Her roommate took nude
pictures of both of us.
I took nude pictures of them...
...wrestling on a Slip-and-Slide,
coming at me like....
Enjoy.
Francine...
...excuse me, but...
...this has cheese on it.
lt"s better with cheese.
l"m not conducting a poll.
You see, I can"t digest this.
Cheese is no longer my friend.
lf I eat this, it wilI be bad for me and
everybody else on this side of the room.
Could you give me another one?
Could you take this one
and wrap them both to go?
And the check.
-Nothing would give me greater pleasure.
-Thank you.
Where am I going?
-Sacramento, where our son is.
-You don"t understand.
We don"t know what"s going on.
She"s telling us different stories.
We don"t know who the reaI father is.
We won"t know unless we go there
and find out for ourselves.
Thank you.
What"s the matter?
WilI you do me a favor?
Look back and see
if there"s a dead body in the road.
What?
Please.
Nothing"s there.
There"s not a body lying in the road?
A body.
No, nothing there.
Oh, good.
I often think l"ve run someone over.
I hope he"s here.
Don"t worry. Let me be your guide.
I know this world.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
-Let"s split up.
-No, don"t!
You go that way, l"lI go this way.
Ask if they"ve seen Scott.
Ask if l"ve seen Scott.
Go ahead.
Excuse me, have you seen this boy?
Have you seen this boy?
No.
My God!
You alI right?
No, l"m not alI right! WilI you get it off?
lt was an accident. l"m sorry.
Have you seen...
...a young man named Scott?
He"s my son!
Perfect. Have you seen this boy?
Thank you.
You want him?
Stop it.
That"s him!
That"s Scott!
This is a family show!
My boy!
Get the gate!
Turn around.
Mr. Huge, we must get back to that boy.
Turn around! Private area!
Let"s make it a semiprivate area.
-l"lI hurt you, old man.
-Old man?
Old man.
-Let me telI you....
-What?
Let"s go. What?
Let"s go. Come on.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Everything"s alI right. l"m here. lt"s okay.
lt"s not him.
Who"s this?
I don"t know.
He"s over here!
-CalI your father.
-Come on!
ls he okay?
We"ve got to get him up. He"s out cold.
Boy, this guy"s in good shape.
-That girl"s not for you.
-She"s for everybody else.
At least we know he ate.
Get him out of here.
He"lI catch pneumonia.
No, he"s okay, Collette.
No, I promise.
l"lI telI you alI about it
when I see you, but....
What we"re going to do is...
...we"re going to bring him back
to the hoteI in San Francisco tonight.
And then...
...we"lI bring him home tomorrow.
And then...
...listen to me, we have to...
...work this thing out.
You"re welcome.
l"lI telI him.
She was happy?
She was happy and relieved.
lt"s funny, the first time
I got drunk was over a girl.
My first suicide attempt was over a girl.
Are you joking? You really...?
I used to be somewhat unstable.
What happened?
lt was high school.
We were doing The King and l.
My drama teacher...
...Miss Manero...
...stayed late once to show me
the dance the King does with Anna.
""ShalI we dance?
""One, two, three.""
She taught me the dance...
...then showed me a part
that was cut from the original.
You made it with
your high schooI teacher?
Yeah.
You know, l"ve got to telI you...
...I don"t know what you have
to be depressed about.
You take nude pictures of girls.
You hump your faculty.
Your life is something
l"d be ashamed to rent.
But she dumped me.
Look, these things happen.
-ls there...?
-There"s nobody there.
Thank you.
-Can you take a plane in the morning?
-No, that"d be too late.
l"m his father. I want to be there
when he wakes up.
lf I drive straight through
I can just make it.
Are you stilI angry at me?
Actually, l"m angry at myself.
I should"ve been the one
to go after him at the first place.
I wanted to give him a chance
to come home on his own.
And he didn"t.
I love him and want him to know it.
I should go.
-For the road.
-Thanks.
When you see...Jack and Dale,
telI them how sorry and ashamed I feel.
I didn"t think l"d see Scotty again.
l"m sorry you couldn"t count on me.
Good evening.
-How are you, André?
-Fine.
I got him. lt"s okay, I got him.
Wait, wait. Can we get...?
May I help you?
We"re fine.
-Sure?
-Absolutely.
Little man had a big day.
Good evening.
Anything we can help you with?
Would you send the valet to my room.
Right away.
Here we go.
Good evening.
After you.
We"lI take the next one.
He"s a mess.
Oh, my God.
What, fungus?
Look at his toes. Look at his toes.
What am I missing?
Notice how the big one bends that way
and the little one tucks underneath?
You"re easily entertained.
Really? Entertain this.
-What?
-See? lt"s a match.
We have the same toes.
Millions of people have toes like that.
Really?
Do you?
Let"s see.
Take your shoes and socks off.
-No, I won"t.
-Take them off.
-Get away.
-Let"s see what you got.
-What"re you doing?
-Take them off.
Get off me!
Let me see them!
I wilI sue you!
Uncle! Uncle! Stop! Stop! Don"t!
l"m really sorry.
You don"t match.
No match. You lose. l"m the father.
Means nothing.
That"s not proof.
Oh, toe-boy.
Check this out.
What?
The whirl.
The whirl?
The boy has a whirl.
Just like I have.
See? That"s a whirl.
This is a curl. That"s a whirl.
Do you have a whirl?
No.
No whirl.
You...
...are whirl-less.
Thank you very much.
I go to a hairdresser, get a whirl.
Really?
I would telI José maybe
to add some more hair, okay?
Let me ask you something, whirly.
Okay, but nothing about sports.
When did Collette calI you?
When did she telI you about him?
Tuesday.
Oh, too bad.
l"m the father. You lose.
But we have lovely parting gifts.
You get alI that from ""Tuesday""?
How?
Because she saw me on Monday.
So?
I wasn"t very cooperative.
So then she came to you.
I cannot believe you did that
with an unconscious child.
Get the phone.
Excuse me.
Jack.
Finally. Where have you been?
I was out.
l"ve been calling you alI night.
I was afraid you"d been killed.
l"m absolutely fine.
I had something I had to do.
Where"ve you been?
-Some soap.
-Who was that?
No one.
No one?
Actually, honey, it"s a friend.
I made a new friend.
Valet.
l"m hosing him down!
What is that noise?
The shower.
You two are showering?
No, we"re not. l"m not in the shower.
He"s in the shower.
And you"re watching him?
Someone called for a valet?
Excuse me. I knocked,
but I guess you didn"t hear me.
He"s so slippery!
l"lI come back.
Just a second.
The jacket is on the desk,
l"lI give you the pants.
-Honey, I must take off my pants.
-Don"t calI me honey.
No, not you. Honey, hold on.
No, I won"t.
ls he okay?
Pick up the phone!
Pick up the phone, Jack!
How"s everything at the house?
Go, go.
He"s going to blow!
What is...?
What"s that noise?
You are confusing me. l"m very tired.
Explain what"s going on there.
Listen, it"s very complicated.
He"s soaking wet!
Get over here! Dry his toes!
Honey, I have to go!
I must towel-off the boy.
What boy?
Bye.
That went well.
There you go.
Did you have to talk alI the time?
I was in there alI alone!
Why can"t you respect my privacy?
l"m trying to clean up our boy!
He"s weeping, now.
Now he"s weeping.
This is great.
Why"d we put him in the shower?
You just could"ve wept on him.
God!
Fifteen minutes tilI I take this deposition.
Where is he with my suit?
-Look at this.
-That"s money.
I remember that from when I was single.
lt"s $5,000.
I found it in his pants pocket.
$5,000 in cash.
What"s he doing with $5,000 in cash?
He stole it.
Why do you leap to the worst
possible conclusion?
Okay. He won it in a hair-whirI contest.
That"s my suit.
-Here"s your suit.
-Here.
Wait.
Thank you.
Thank you.
-I didn"t see a thing.
-Get out of here.
You took $20 of his money.
-Just $20.
-l"lI keep track of that.
So you owe him $20.
Jack owes $20.
He"s getting up.
Good morning.
Who are you?
l"m Dale Putley.
l"m Jack Lawrence.
We"re...
...friends...
...of your mother.
Where am l?
-San Francisco.
-Mark Hopkins Hotel.
BeautifuI day out there.
You had a big night last night.
-Where"s Nikki?
-I don"t know.
-Sacramento.
-I wouldn"t worry about her.
What"d you do with my...
...my clothes?
You were very sick and....
Don"t be scared.
-I want to get my clothes and go.
-Calm down.
-Can"t keep me here! lt"s illegal!
-Take it easy.
TelI him.
I guess so.
What?
Sit down.
Please.
Got a surprise for you.
Come on.
Have a seat.
Do you mind if I telI it?
Fine.
Seventeen years ago,
your mother and I were...
...pedaling through the wine country.
lt began to rain. lt was more of a mist.
lt was so romantic.
I don"t have time for
the wine country saga now.
Fine.
What l"m about to say
may sound a little bit--
Bizarre.
Unusual.
-That too.
-Unbelievable, actually.
This is the truth as best that...
...we know it.
One of us....
Either one. Either one. Whatever.
Sorry.
One of us...
...might be...
...your father.
I know, it sounds crazy to us too,
but you see--
Seventeen years ago, we both....
Your mother.
And....
-There"s a debate as to who your--
-Father is.
-lt"s the truth.
-This is bullshit.
lt"s true.
-CalI your mother. She"lI telI you.
-She called both of us.
Your car is here.
I must go.
Now?
I have a deposition in 15 minutes.
What can we do?
About what?
About what?
How about the fact
l"m leaving him alone with you?
Why don"t you do the old head butt?
He"lI be sprawled on the floor
when you come back.
WilI you be okay with him if I leave?
l"m more capable than you think.
Where"s my money?
I got it.
Give me my money! That"s my money!
I want it right now!
Back off or l"lI calI the cops!
Let"s just take it easy.
Sorry.
Calm down.
Come here.
Give me the money.
-Give it.
-I disagree with your approach.
Here"s the money. We"re going
to put it right here, for safekeeping.
Just a little while.
I have to go out, and when I come back...
...we"lI talk about this
and get to know each other.
Order from room service.
lt"s on me.
That"s a biggie.
Oh, boy.
Good morning.
BeautifuI day, ain"t it?
Oh, yeah. Perfect so far.
He"s out with the truck.
When he gets back we"lI get your car.
I must calI my wife.
Got any men"s room?
We use a port-a-potty. lt"s out back.
Everything okay?
Oh, yeah.
Help!
Oh, my God!
Help!
This is not good.
You okay?
No, it"s horrible!
-lt was an accident!
-I don"t care!
l"lI get help!
Then I wrote my medicaI musicaI comedy:
""Hello, Doctor lt"s StilI Swollen.""
Catchy?
lt had a great opening number
called ""Hindsight"".
The audience was out there and:
""Hello, Mr. Colon....
""My prostate"s swollen.
""I think that things
are flowing not so well.""
Breakfast.
""l"m feeling heinous, something"s in my--""
Good morning.
Here"s your breakfast.
Oh, yes, indeed.
Yum-yum.
There you go.
What"s here?
Belgian waffles, from Brussels.
Granola, nature"s broom.
Fifteen percent, but l"m not paying...
...so, $20 tip.
Very good, sir.
Enjoy.
Look! Come on.
I saw that. Mr. Dimples,
he"s trying to make an appearance.
""Gray skies are going to clear up.
Sit on a happy face.""
That"s how my mother sang it.
But that"s another story
and a lot of therapy.
Actually, I am pretty hungry.
Thanks for ordering breakfast.
You"re welcome.
You need it after last night.
You want some coffee?
Thank you.
You"re a little gentleman.
You little shit, may you rot in hell!
Woolite!
Sorry.
lt"s okay.
l"lI stand, you go.
Fine. Sorry.
Good afternoon.
Excuse me.
-How are you?
-l"m fine.
Do you know anything about
the man staying here?
I was paid to keep my mouth shut, lady.
No, l"m his wife.
I don"t want to get in the middle.
What? The middle of what?
lf it"s any comfort, l"ve seen worse.
-Help!
-l"m coming.
Oh, man, does that stink.
Get me out! lt"s terrible in here!
lt"d been easier if you"d landed
with the door on top.
Next time.
Don"t worry about it.
Got a winch right here
and we"lI lift the whole thing up.
Hurry! l"m trying to help my son!
My God, is he in there too?
Bring him up!
Looking reaI good!
You okay?
We"lI have you out in--
Oh, God!
Mr. Barmore...
...when you invested
your client"s money in this...
...car-wash restaurant--
Wax and Waffles. What about it?
Did you say your brother owned it...
...and his last three businesses
went bankrupt?
Only one went bankrupt.
Excuse me, two were acts of God.
Acts of God.
That would be the fire
and the enormous gas explosion...
...both occurring in the night?
The fact that they occurred
in the night is coincidence.
The Lord works in mysterious ways.
The sarcasm isn"t necessary.
l"m sorry...
...but there"s someone here who says
he must see Mr. Lawrence.
Who is it?
I don"t know, but he looks strange and...
...he"s....
Weeping?
That is for me. Excuse me a second.
AlI right, let"s take a break.
You"re doing great.
What happened?
He poured hot coffee alI over my penis...
...took my clothes and ran away.
Don"t cry.
Where is he?
I don"t know.
I don"t like you.
Don"t....
Hi, is Jack Lawrence there?
I believe he"s taking a deposition.
This is his wife.
Get me a cab, please.
What?
Reno?
What do you mean?
Why is he going to Reno?
Do you have his flight information?
A rock festivaI in Reno. l"m psyched.
lt"s awesome.
-Shouldn"t we calI Collette?
-And telI her we lost her son?
My batteries are dead
and I must calI Carrie.
Use the pay phone.
l"lI be right over there.
I need to get a new shirt.
This one"s really....
Can I have...$20?
l"m not a mad terrorist, l"m his wife.
I want to see if he"s on the plane.
l"m sorry, it"s a strict FAA rule.
I can"t give that information.
AlI right then, Miss Tweesbury,
l"lI buy a ticket.
You must do that downstairs.
Thanks a lot for your help.
Really appreciate it.
How wilI I make this flight
that leaves in five minutes?
My purse!
-Are you okay?
-l"m fine. Are you okay?
l"m okay.
Have we met?
No, I don"t think so.
May I just say...
""...if springtime had a face, it"d be you.""
That"s swell. l"m in a hurry.
Bless you.
lt"s from one of my longer poems!
lt"s called, ""Cupid"s Shaft.""
Dale, come on.
I had a vision.
Me too. That"s a bad shirt.
You don"t like it?
lt"s fine, come on.
CalI your wife?
Yeah, she"s not there.
Besides, what could I telI her?
lf he"s not my son, why bring it up?
lf he is my kid...
...that"s not how I want to telI her.
Care about her a lot. I can tell.
She"s great.
I love her. She"s my favorite wife.
I don"t want to do anything to screw it up.
Why don"t you have children?
The first two times I married,
I wasn"t ready.
Then I thought I was ready,
but I wasn"t married.
And now Carrie and I are married
just a year, so it"s new.
I should telI you something.
What?
l"m a reluctant flyer.
You can go right on board.
Are you a frequent flier?
Because there"s a new mileage deaI here?
You can apply today...
...and get a credit card and get...
...a free mile with every dollar
that you charge. That"s a great deal.
-Hold me.
-That"s a very good deal.
Sir...
-...take a big sip of this.
-Thank you, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Here"s some extra napkins.
lt"s a miracle you didn"t
get really hurt in that thing.
-That went down like a--
-I should calI my wife.
Wait. Let me get your ear.
You got something in there
you don"t want in there.
You"lI be okay.
I thought we lost you.
I just had some stuff--
Have you seen Nikki?
We"re crashed in 215.
She"s up there now?
I really wanted to surprise her.
Can I borrow your key?
AlI right.
Thanks.
Matt and Lee are looking for you.
They"re here?
Yeah, in here.
I made it.
I thought maybe
you went home or something.
What"s going on?
What do you mean?
I mean with you and Mark.
I don"t know.
Do you stilI like me?
Yeah, Scott.
I got you something.
-What is it?
-Open it.
Cool.
They"re reaI diamonds.
lt"lI look nice on you.
Cost $4,700.
Let"s do it. Please.
Come on. Please. Please.
Come on.
Back off.
l"m playing that one.
I got directions to the hotel
where the band is staying.
lt"lI take five minutes.
Hello!
-We"re looking for a kid, remember?
-Oh, yeah.
What is this outfit?
I lent you $200 and you look
like Howdy Doody. What is this?
lt only cost $1 10.
Where"s my change?
ln one of these machines.
You put my money in these machines?
Yeah.
Damn you!
There"s got to be a blood bank
open somewhere.
They give cash, don"t they?
Let"s go.
Hello, Snot.
Surprised to see us?
I think so.
I came here to look for you.
Oh, really? Listen, Scott....
Where"s the stuff?
Stuff?
The stuff.
Look...
...we gave you a simple job.
Any moron could do it, even Matt.
Even me.
ln fact, if l"m not mistaken, you asked
for the job. So, where"s the stuff?
The guy...
...didn"t show up.
No, you see, he called...
...and you didn"t show up.
I waited! I was supposed
to stand right by--
AlI right.
You didn"t get the stuff.
Where"s the money?
Our money! The $5,000, where is it?
lt"s in a safe.
A safe.
lt"s at my hotel, by the airport.
l"lI get it.
Really?
Do I have ""asshole"" tattooed
on my forehead or something?
No.
I think we alI better go get it.
Like a date.
You"re not bullshitting us?
lf you are, l"lI kilI you.
Get back here! Wait untiI I catch you!
Get back here!
Move!
I see this a lot. Rich kid running wild.
Probably has an expensive car.
There"s no discipline.
Bob gives him no control, no boundaries.
Now Bob has no kid.
I think it"s exactly the opposite.
The kid needs compassion,
attention and a big hug.
You know what this kid needs?
The kid needs a great big--
I hit someone!
lt"s not at alI like I imagined it.
lt"s Scott!
-My arm!
-Are you okay?
-Please calI 91 1 !
-Calm down.
-You hit our son!
-lt was an accident! Shut up!
Did you calI the hoteI in San Francisco?
No, they must be driving back.
No, l"m sure he"s fine.
No, l"m alI right.
No, l"m driving back right now.
No, I love you, honey.
He"s going to kilI us.
You fix the tires?
Yeah, well, we fixed the tires....
But what?
He cracked the axle
when he towed the car back.
But don"t worry, we can fix it
in a day or so, maybe.
The doctor says he"s fine. A simple brake.
He gave him a prescription
in case there"s pain. He"s in there.
-You can go in.
-Thanks a lot.
lt"s been a long day, you know?
-How are you feeling?
-Thanks!
Come here.
-l"m sorry.
-You ran me over.
I know you both might be my father.
Leave me alone.
Was my mother a whore, or what?
Watch your mouth. Your mother
was someone we cared about.
She cares about you.
Do you know how lucky you are?
Maybe.
You know, you have no idea
what my father"s like.
So telI us.
Nikki"s the first girI that I ever loved.
My father doesn"t care.
He wouldn"t let me see her anymore.
He says she"s bad news, a tramp.
He says he"s putting his foot down.
Blah, blah, blah.
He never lets me explain.
lt"s like, for absolutely no reason,
he"lI just take my car away.
You have a car?
Scott, your father is Mr. Rogers.
Want to hear a father story?
Here comes the lecture.
No lecture, just a story.
On my 10th birthday...
...my father takes me to the circus.
What a great story.
On the way...
...we drop my dog off at the vet.
We have fun at the circus.
I come home and say, ""Where"s Skippy?""
And they go, ""We had to put him to sleep.""
And I said, ""You mean, he"s dead?
""You killed my dog?""
He said, ""He was sick that"s why
we brought him to the vet.""
And I said:
""Why"d you do it on my birthday?""
And he said, ""lt was on the way.""
What"s the point?
What"s the point?
The point....
The point is...
...that...
...parents...
...screw up sometimes.
They don"t mean it.
They make mistakes because
they"re human beings.
Doesn"t mean they don"t love you.
Just means that...
...they"re doing their best.
You know?
I can"t eat anymore.
Don"t worry, I didn"t understand
the story either.
-What about the Rolling Stones?
-They"re old.
-How about Zeppelin?
-They had a nice logo. They were okay.
-But Jimi Hendrix? Come on!
-He was good, but he"s dead.
True.
Speaking of bad music....
No, you can"t do it. This was my band.
You have your Sugar Ray.
Sly and the Family Stone
was who I followed around.
FeeI that?
Jack"s going to ""funk-a-fy.""
Watch out! lt"s Deney Terrio"s
Attorney Dance Party.
Now, get down and depose!
That"s the worst dancing.
Everyone I know dances like this.
You must wiggle when you listen to Sly.
You"re right. Wait a minute.
I got my mojo.
There it is.
Oh, watch out, now. Funky chicken!
When I was in high school
I had an Afro this big.
-I don"t believe you.
-I needed help lifting my head.
I once shaved my head and
glued alI the hair to my ass.
Why?
Two speciaI brownies
and a quart of tequila.
So you two, you were like freaks.
Oh, yeah.
I was so stoned once,
everyone sounded like Johnny Mathis.
When you"re young you do some things
that you"re not that proud of.
We even got in a lot of trouble sometimes.
Truth is, l"m in a lot of trouble myself.
Does it have to do with $5,000?
Scotty, we"re not here to judge.
Come on, telI us.
I stole that money.
From drug dealers.
-What, are you nuts?
-Hey, what are you doing?
Yelling like that doesn"t help. Just relax.
Sorry.
Give it back.
I spent it.
You spent it! He spent
the money from drug dealers!
That"s not the way. Breathe.
You said I could talk to you.
You can"t run from these guys.
They"lI find you.
They"lI come to your house,
take alI your money and beat you up.
Happened to me twice.
Listen....
Let me talk to them.
I do this sort of thing a lot.
Why are you trying to help me?
We"re your fathers.
Come on.
Let"s do this!
Calling this guy, fat guy from Jersey.
Where are you going?
-Kick some ass.
-There wilI be no ass-kicking.
-Let"s go.
-What"re you doing?
-Coming with you.
-You"re not.
-I am.
-I don"t want you to.
They"re crazy.
I want you to get in the car. Get in.
-I need water, okay?
-l"lI get you some water.
The phone is right there. CalI your mother.
TelI her that you"re okay
and that you"re coming home.
Thanks.
We"re going to kick some ass.
Get in the car.
Now!
You ready?
lf this is going to work
you must calm down.
lt"s them.
Open the door!
Scheming little....
What"s going on?
He"s gone.
-ln what sense?
-He stole my rentaI car and he left.
I never felt so stupid.
You"ve never been a parent before.
This is too much trouble.
I can"t do this. I have a life.
You"re not giving up.
Good luck.
I mean that. l"m sorry.
I must calI my wife and telI her
l"m coming home.
We"ve had a few setbacks,
but we"re great together.
You"lI never know if he"s your son.
-I don"t even care.
-Yes, you do.
You care, yes, you do.
Stop it.
Machine again. Why have a house
if you don"t live in it?
Hi, honey.
You"re there.
Let me explain everything.
Why don"t you go ahead?
Hi.
I must go now, because you"re here.
lgnore that message when you"re home.
This is your wife?
lt"s you!
You know him?
He tried to pick me up.
-When?
-This morning.
-I didn"t.
-You were with me.
-You were on the phone.
-So you picked up my wife?
I didn"t know she was your wife.
She was a sexy woman.
Watch that.
This is your friend?
Your shower buddy?
No, we never showered together.
-The boy and I were in the shower.
-He soaped him up.
-And hosed him off.
-I watched.
That"s all.
What boy?
Seventeen years ago--
Would you stop? Can I just have
a private moment with my wife?
Sorry.
Come here.
This whole thing...
...is about a boy...
...that I might be the father of.
There"s a cab.
Taxi!
-Sorry if l"ve ruined your life.
-You haven"t.
He wanted to come home,
but I kept pushing him--
lt"s okay. Don"t worry.
But it"s not his fault.
Really.
-Thanks. Take it easy.
-Bye.
l"lI just be a second.
Even if you find him again,
he"lI only spit in your face.
Maybe.
How"s that going to make you feel?
You"re very successful.
So?
Your wife, your success, they...
...filI up...
...areas.
What l"m trying to say is...
...I need this kid.
lf he doesn"t want me around...
...let him turn me down.
Good luck, Dale.
Thanks, Jack.
Taxi!
Taxi!
My car is there, so l"lI follow you.
We can work it out.
You can"t be mad that I had sex
with this woman 17 years ago.
You were 14 years old.
-Do you have a picture?
-Of her?
Of the boy, Jack.
He"s handsome.
I guess, but this kid is a major pain
in the ass. He"s so damn annoying.
-You don"t like anything annoying.
-Who does?
That"s a really speciaI thing for you.
Give me a break. l"ve had a hard day.
You"ve had a hard day.
Why should I give you a break?
I don"t want to talk about it again.
We"ve never had this talk.
No, we haven"t,
but I have had this conversation.
The ""Wives of Christmas Past"" talk.
Leave Penelope and Tallulah out of this.
-lris and Debbie.
-Whatever.
Why are you so upset?
Because I want to have kids
with you someday.
What if this was our son?
Would you give up on him
because he was annoying?
His own father gave up on him.
That"s the guy who raised him.
AlI I am is the guy
who slept with his mother.
The other guy who slept with his mother
is out looking for him.
Dale is a desperate person
with an empty life.
He"s not happy like me.
-Badge.
-Badge?
You don"t understand. I belong back there.
I have to get back there.
Do you know who you"re talking to?
Do you know who I am?
Dale Putley. And who are you?
l"m Bob.
lf you don"t let me back there
heads wilI rolI and it"lI be yours.
Not without a badge.
Know who I am?
The cowboy with The Village People!
lf I don"t get back there,
there"lI be ""Y, M...A! ""
So let me back there! Right now!
Not without a badge.
A badge. I need a badge.
Let"s get in there, okay?
Here"s my badge, Bob!
Guys, listen.
The Muffs are off in ten minutes.
We should be setting up
in about five, alI right?
That"s the band.
Follow me.
What"lI we do?
-Hello.
-Excuse me. Can I help you?
Excuse me. That"s very funny.
And I love when it"s funny.
Stu Gold, from the agency.
Say ""hi"" to the biggest record producer
on this side of the lake.
This is Gunther Über Allen...
...from Deutsche Bebop.
Biggest record producer in Europe.
Say ""hi"" to the guys. This is Sugar Ray.
Der Wunderkinder.
-I think we met before.
-Düsseldorf, maybe.
How are you?
Hi, how are you? Give me high five.
That"s how it starts.
I love you.
Who does this guy record?
Biggest producer in Germany. Records....
Their Cars.
Big Hairy Women.
Yeah, in America, Boys To Women.
l"ve heard of them.
lf I have you, we could take Europe.
-We could take Europe in what?
-One month.
-With air support.
-With airplay.
That"s better. We could do that for you.
You don"t need Atlantic.
lt"s time to go. Let"s do it.
-Not here.
-Where is he?
I don"t know.
Stick with the girl. He"lI be back.
Excuse me.
l"m sorry, I need that pin back.
-What pin?
-l"m sorry, I need it back.
Leave me alone. I need the pin.
Why"d you steaI the car?
You"re not going home?
Here are the keys. lt"s in the lot.
Leave me alone.
Can we talk?
l"m going to dance on stage.
Look, everybody"s tired of you! Enough!
Stop this. lt"s gone on long enough.
-I thought he was German.
-Me too.
Can you do me a favor...
...and explain to Scott that
which is obvious to everyone but him?
Okay.
Thanks.
-This is none of your business.
-You need to hear this.
He won"t believe it unless you telI him.
Well, Scotty...
...you"re boring.
I liked you for a while,
but now I can"t stand looking at you.
Even your voice makes me sick.
Lovely.
Hallmark is waiting for you.
Thank you.
She"s not for you, son.
l"m a loser.
Come on, you"re 16.
To be a true loser
takes years of dedicated ineptitude.
Trust me.
There"lI be other girls.
The truth hurts.
Here"s what hurts:
I trusted him and he steals the car.
Look, I didn"t steal....
I don"t want to talk about it right now,
okay?
Get him out of here.
This man has a major mime issue.
Get reaI rope. l"lI hang you.
Stop it.
Why don"t you get a reaI job?
Build a reaI wall. Stop it.
-We lost the boy.
-Where"d he go?
Get out of here!
We"re not good at this.
You go that way, l"lI go this way.
-I thought you were someone else.
-l"m Scott.
You want something?
You want a nose ring?
No, thanks. Another time.
Does that hurt?
Not the ones in the face.
The one that really hurt was....
Yeah, I bet.
-What did you do to your arm?
-Let"s go for a walk.
Excuse me, is there a problem here?
-Who are you?
-l"m Scott"s father.
-Has he done something wrong?
-Yes, actually.
He stole $5,000 from me.
He did?
I assure you he"lI be properly punished.
Young man,
stealing money from drug dealers!
You are grounded, mister.
Have we learned nothing
from the music of John Lennon?
""AlI we need is love.""
No, alI we need is money!
Do you have an Advil?
You again.
-You"re dead.
-No, you are.
You"re doing it wrong.
I noticed.
The power comes from your back.
Watch. Like this.
See? Let me show you again.
Who else wants a piece of me?
Let"s go, boys! l"lI kick your ass!
l"lI be there!
Listen, Calvin, thanks for going
so far out of your way.
lt"s really above and beyond the call.
Look at this place.
You must"ve robbed a bank at some time.
Scott"s probably home.
l"m nervous about what to say to him.
Can I give you a little bit of advice here?
Stop being so stiff, okay?
And lighten up and take that pickle
out of your butt.
Listen, it"s not enough to love him...
...you must show him you love him.
Give him a big hug.
Thank you.
Ain"t nothing.
-Take care.
-I will. Listen....
l"lI calI you.
You got my number.
You got it.
This is for my fine,
his fine and the boy"s fine.
This is for getting the car back.
This is for the fabulous breakfast we had.
Are eggs supposed to make noise
when you eat them?
Very funny.
Here"s your claim check for the car.
-Stay out of trouble.
-Yes, sir.
Thanks. See you at the reunion.
I go away for a minute
and you buy him this shirt?
He wanted it.
-You"lI spoiI him.
-One shirt wilI spoiI him.
-Fine.
-I like it.
What"s wrong?
l"m afraid of flying.
Give me a minute.
-This is not exactly DNA evidence, okay?
-Maybe.
Come on.
lt"lI be fine.
Don"t be afraid, Scotty.
lt"s okay. lt"s just a little bump.
You"re doing great.
You"re doing great.
lt"s okay, breathe. There you go.
Just breathe.
-Thank you.
-That"s okay.
Your shoelace is untied. I got it.
I got it. There you are.
lt"s hard with one hand.
There you go.
Hi, dad.
Come in, come in. Are you okay?
Everything alI right?
Really? You"re alI right? Really?
I was worried. Come here.
l"m sorry.
l"m sorry. Bob.
Jack Lawrence.
Dale Putley.
Come on in. Your mom"s in back.
Nice home.
What happened?
-A little accident.
-You won"t believe what happened to me.
Bright.
What color yellow is this?
Baby.
Oh, sweetheart.
Nice family.
Such a cute baby.
Look at him.
Look at this little cowboy hat.
l"m taking this.
You can"t. lt belongs to them.
You"re right.
Look.
Do you understand the situation?
You told them both they were my fathers
so they"d come look for me.
Right.
I lied to them.
Your mother....
-Both of us wanted you back so badly.
-I understand.
I think it"s time I told them the truth.
Would you guys mind if I told them?
You?
l"m the reason that everything happened,
right?
Where"s Jack?
ln the den, calling his office.
You okay? Everything...
...alI right?
Yeah, I just...
...talked to my mom.
Oh, you did?
She told me who my reaI father is.
Who is it?
She says it"s you.
Really?
She says she"s sure.
Oh, God! Come here.
I knew! The whirl....
We should be quiet.
l"m worried about Jack.
Yeah, you"re right, you"re right.
-We shouldn"t telI him.
-Right.
lt"d break his heart.
He seems tough...
...but he"s so fragile.
lt"lI be our little secret.
You know, I was thinking...
...maybe in a few years,
l"lI come to Berkeley.
Oh, yes, son.
Take photography.
I called my office.
Good news,
everything went bad without me.
lt"s not that funny.
No, no, it isn"t.
l"lI go calI the airport,
see when the next flight home is.
What"s with him?
He just told me a funny story.
So, you know,
I was talking to my mom before....
She told me who my reaI father is.
Who?
You.
Me?
l"m so happy.
Me too.
Thank you.
I really appreciate everything you"ve done.
He told me.
Thank you.
You"re welcome.
See you!
Why don"t you come in and relax,
have a drink?
You can take a swim if you want.
That"s sweet of you,
but l"lI just come in, calI a cab...
...head to the airport.
You know what? Take my car.
You"re giving me your car.
That"s so Elvis of you.
Not to keep.
No, to take to the airport.
Put it in the overnight valet and
one of my interns wilI get it tomorrow.
Are you sure you want me driving this car?
lt"s just a thing. lt"s just a car. lt"s just a...
...a classic, irreplaceable car. That"s all.
-What"s this dent?
-Where?
You mirth machine.
Thanks, Jack.
We did good.
