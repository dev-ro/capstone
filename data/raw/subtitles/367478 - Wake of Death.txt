 I repeat: </ i>
 We the American </ i>
 immigration authorities. </ i>
 We have made sure </ i>
 for food, drink and clothes ...</ i>
What about corpses?
Send them to the morgue,
and call the Chinese Embassy.
Come on.
We take care of her.
I am completely exhausted.
- How is she?
- She'll be all right.
I want to take her
home. Just last night.
I turned 52 last week
so I'm old.
I have any trouble with the heart and kidneys.
Now it is shown also angry with the hearing.
We can not simply load her off
at a detention center.
- Why?
- She is 14 years and has suffered much.
She speaks English? No, surely?
What is special about her?
- Can you get it over your heart?
- I've said as heart problems.
Come on.
Yes ... Make sure she comes
to the hearing tomorrow.
And I will not be fired because of this.
I get just a moment with her?
Are you okay?
My name is Cynthia.
Do you speak English?
What is your name?
I take you home.
Is it okay with you?
Well.
- Ben?
- I am here.
Hello, darling.
How are you?
This is Kim.
And it is my husband Ben.
Sit down only.
I missed you.
I go out and make a bath
to you, Kim.
It is chocolate.
Are you better now?
Where are you from, Kim?
Will you not talk to me?
It's alright.
Good night, darling.
- What's wrong, Kim?
- There must be light.
 I am with you in your dreams. </ i>
- Why can not you speak Chinese?
- My foster parents are Chinese.
Put you to bed.
- You have taken work home with you.
- Yes.
I need it here.
How did it in Dallas?
- Fine. I had to help a friend.
- So I know my husband again.
The mysterious man.
You know I'd rather not
will talk about my work.
I have been
in the restaurant business for twenty years.
It's a different world than yours.
And I have done things
I am not so proud of in life.
I just want to protect my family.
I work with immigration.
I see terrible things every day.
I'm not an idiot.
I know who I married.
A restaurateur from Marseilles.
I've thought about it here
a thousand times.
At one point I stopped
trying to understand it.
Do you know why? Because I know
you better than you know yourself.
You are a wonderful man and has
made about your life for our sake.
You just know
it means everything to me.
- Never leave me.
- I do not either.
I love you.
Welcome to L.A., mr. Quan.
 Works I to find her? </ i>
 - We'll find her. </ i>
 - Is she okay? </ i>
 We do not know yet, sir. </ i>
 I get Kim back on my way. </ i>
Mrs. Archer, They can not just take
an illegal immigrant in custody.
- It's illegal.
- Yes, but when I saw her ...
And your application
for political asylum ...
There is no question
on religious persecution.
Therefore, he just does not stay in the U.S..
Sentence.
Hoggins, it ought to have known.
- She is in danger.
- Why?
- Her mother was killed.
- A Case of Police in Hong Kong.
Contact the authorities over there.
I mourn for deportation.
Mr. Judge ... Give me one week
to prove that I'm right.
It may not suit the government
will not let me watch her.
I need a week.
She is in danger of Hong Kong.
I ask only for a week.
A week.
I have in the U.S.
immigration custody.
I get a phone call.
I have the right to legal counsel.
Have not afford it
Smoking In direct return to China.
 Where are you? </ i>
So we meet at last.
Do you like Malibu?
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Take a seat.
We lost two "mules".
Heroin jumped into their stomachs.
It happens
when they are not getting enough water to drink.
- I must see a little better for them.
- It's your problem.
 Our </ i> problem. I would hate to pay
for something I did not get.
Have you found my girl?
We do business.
2 million U.S. dollars.
Next shipment: 20 million.
And the next batch
coming Wednesday, is not it?
And yes ...
I have found your girl for you.
She came with one of your boats.
Ironic, huh?
Have you touched her?
Have you touched her?
What do you take me for?
You left her
among white people.
She is with a caseworker.
It is better than a detention center.
Do you like not
about white people?
A pleasure to deal
with you, Quan.
 Find her. </ i>
When I came here, I had to work
in ten years for my freedom.
And it has not changed.
There are still thousands who
are willing to accept slavery.
Be quiet in your policy.
You can probably see, she is sorry.
It is probably not right now
we must talk about it.
Poor child. She is tired.
Slipped up in your room.
Nicholas, you can then go with Kim.
Come on, Kim.
 Hurry up a bit. </ i>
 - There's nothing to see here. </ i>
 - Open the door. </ i>
Father!
Come!
Where is the girl?
 Go! The two keep watch. </ I>
Nicholas? Nicholas!
Suspects in the murder
- Did you ever?
- No.
- What about my gun?
- It's evidence.
- I suppose.
- Where?
In addition to finding my son.
We'll find Nicholas.
We have people out across the city.
 Phone, boss. </ i>
 worthless pig. </ i>
 You let my daughter get away. </ i>
 Get the guy out of the way </ i>
 and find my daughter. </ i>
Go to Chinatown.
Find Andy Wang.
I know it was him
I looked outside the restaurant.
Are you sure
that I should not stay with you?
You are a free man.
I'll find Nicholas.
Shut up, which is empty here.
I want you, baby.
I will miss you.
I will miss you.
- Where is my son? Where is my son?
- I kill you!
 Run </ i>
 Ben, the kids are in the house. </ i>
 They're safe. </ i>
 - Nicholas'm fine. </ i>
- Well, Max. I come. Thank you.
- Beware.
 - Sure. </ i>
- What the hell happened, Ben?
- Where is Nicholas?
He lies and sleeps.
What happened?
- Where is she?
- The little girl? Yonder.
Wake up.
- Kim! Wake up!
- Calm down, man.
Who killed my wife?
Say something.
I heard the shots.
I took hold of Nicholas,
and we ran away. Sorry.
Andy Wang.
Do you know him?
Andy Wang?
Who is after you?
- Sun Quan.
- Who is Sun Quan?
- Say something now.
- He has followed me.
He hit my mom to death.
Did he kill my wife?
- Why did my wife you home?
- Stop it, Ben.
It's not my fault!
Why he killed my mother?
Dad?
Where's Mom?
She's dead, my baby.
Ben ... Tony has come.
- Do you know anything of Wang?
- The Chinese Triads.
He owns a horehus in town
and keep your there.
I have it from a prostitute,
coming into the club.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Let's run there.
Let us take care of Wang ... now.
- Take with Raymond.
- Raymond, stay with Max.
Max, if something happens ...
... As Nicholas is your son.
Raymond, download guns.
It is her.
- Hello, darling.
- He's upstairs. Bedroom 107th
Thank you.
Down with you!
See the devil to come down!
Down! Down! Down on the floor!
And stay down there!
 Move, bitch! </ i>
Down!
Stay current!
 Keep </ i>
 Get me out! Give me the gun! </ I>
Who the hell are you?
- It's for my wife.
- Fuck my ass!
Hoggins? What are you doing here?
It is not your board.
It may be related
with the murder of Cynthia Archer.
Have you any ideas?
Two men in balaclavas.
No fingerprints.
Professional work.
What a day it has been.
Keep me informed, right?
We have a problem.
Andy Wang is dead.
Your small number of Mama Lis
restaurant did not improve.
The Chinese embassy cremated
no corpses, so they find heroin.
In other words, the whole shit.
I expose our agreement.
The only
be deferred in life is death.
Spare me your bullshit oriental.
You threaten me?
If it feels such
As is the case.
I'm not in the mood
of Chinese puzzles.
We are not on the contract.
I need money on Wednesday.
Shit ... You are just so icy.
Do not you think we have problems?
We run a quiet and peaceful
small smuggling enterprise --
- And now you've made it on
for a gangster movie.
One man goes into your horehus
and kills three of your people.
It is a problem.
Police believe
that it was Ben Archer.
You have killed Ben Archer's wife,
then we have problems to hell.
It is too late.
You can not back out of it now.
 Ben, you will have a cup of coffee? </ i>
Yes.
How do we now Sun Quan?
We must first find out
who the hell he is.
We should be talking with hoggins.
With immigration authorities.
He must know something.
 - What do you want? </ i>
- Can you still do a damn thing English?
- Ben?
- Yes.
Hello, Max.
- I knew you were here.
 - A cup of coffee, Raymond. </ i>
What happened
home with you last night?
I smashed a window by accident.
- And the shooting on the street ..?
- An accident.
You were not at a brothel
at 3rd Street last night, right?
- No.
- And you were in the club, not Tony?
Jo.
Well, ...
Two gangsters shot a guy
named Andy Wang.
They had balaclavas on.
We know they are white.
But anyway ... I fucking care.
He was a drug dealer and pimp.
When I got there,
there was total chaos.
Hoggins from immigration

- Hoggins?
- Yes.
The I can not really gear.
I find out for yourself.
You are always welcome
to drop.
 Are you back? </ i>
 I have to find out </ i>

Do not slip away from us.
Can you hear me? Listen carefully.
Where we find the fucking Chinese?
