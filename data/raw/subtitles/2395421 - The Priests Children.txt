PRIEST'S CHILDREN
God Bless.
I am Simon. The chaplain.
Dr. Babic sent me
because of your surgery.
I told Babic I won't accept
abortion. Get out.
Ah... You are the father?
- And the mother...
Wait. You want to say you are...
- Pregnant? What, you can't tell?
But, if you were pregnant indeed,
smoking's not good for you.
So, how is this baby conceived?
- Man, what do you want?
A confession? - The confession
happens to be our Holy Sacrament.
Son, don't. Just go home.
Don't be stupid. - But, why?
Because it's dangerous.
It could as well happen to you, too.
You really insist on this, ha?
Let's do it, then! Just don't
tell I didn't warn you.
In the name of the Father, the
Son and the Holy Spirit. - Amen.
On a bright, sunny day, I've come
to the island right after my young mass.
I was to substitute rev. Jacob
in the parish.
At first, I was a chaplain,
then I've become the reverend.
But due to parish folks, who
begged the Bishop,
Rev. Jacob remained in the parish,
waiting to be transferred
He led the mass every third Sunday.
"God, I give myself to you, I put
my life right there into your hands,
to the purest of all loves
I gladly give my soul
You're the Road
and You're the Truth.
Apart from leading
the children's church quire,
Rev. Jacob played centrefold
in the local veterans club.
I know nothing about football. He
played bowl with the locals.
I am not as good in sports...
He sang in the a cappela
band "Skoje", which almost won...
the a cappela festival prize
in the city of Omis. Twice.
Unfortunately, I can't sing.
During the Easter holidays,
the queue for his confession booth
was always longer than for mine.
And everyone loved him...
And I didn't like it.
He wasn't doing a priest's job!
The island was dying!
Since I've arrived here, I wrote
22 names in the Book of the Dead,
and not a single soul
in the Book of the Born.
There were less and
less true believers.
Folks were only interested in their
personal pleasure, forgetting the soul.
And there was nothing
I could do about it...
Up until one confession!
Where?
Well, I can drop by another time.
Look at the queue...
You wait in front of
Rev. Fabian's booth.
But he always orders a Sacrament
of Penance. - You wait then!
Slowly...
Hey, Mate, old man... could I
jump in front, before you?
I left work and my orders
are arriving, I'd have to.
No! There's a queue! I'm
waiting as well! - I'll be quick.
In the name of the Father, the
Son and the Holy Spirit. - Amen.
I humbly confess to Almighty God
and to you, Father
for all my sins and trespasses
back from last Easter.
It's not that I sinned much.
Except I curse.
And what do you curse?
- All. God and Jesus mostly,
but here and there,
Our Blessed Lady gets it.
I know it's not in the spirit of
Christianity, but I can't control myself.
What about your other trespasses?
- My wife... Martha...
Keeps telling me I kill people.
I beg your pardon?
What do you do?
...that I kill people.
- What do you mean?
With that rubber. - What rubber?
- The one you put on... the male thing.
With the condom.
- I get it. But...
How is it that you
kill people with that?
I kill them before they're
even born. - Hello?!
You plan to end any time soon?
Will you please calm down? This is a
Holy Sacrament. The man is confessing.
We're in a hurry too! He came in off
the queue! - You'll get your turn.
We'll all get our turn...
Continue. - I don't
think that is a much of a sin.
I work at the newsstand,
I have to sell those.
Otherwise, I will lose my job.
But Martha said the Pope proclaims
the stuff as a sin, so I have to confess.
And... how many of those you've
sold so far? - Only God knows.
To foreigners during summer,
to our folks all year around.
To be honest with you, I don't know if
anyone sleeps with their wives without it.
As for me, I've never ever put that
on myself, I was always, you know...
doing the thing into my Martha.
And she's infertile anyway.
How long it's been going on?
- I'm filling her up since our wedding day,
but no way will she conceive.
- That's not what I meant.
I meant, how long you've been
selling those? - Oh, that.
More and more in the past
several years.
I have to place new orders all the
time. So, tell me now, reverend,
What do you think?
Is that a sin if I sell them or not?
Come on, Mate, it's your turn.
Come on, get up. Get up!
Hello! You're sleeping?
Wake up, hello!
Oh, dear! He died! Woe is me! It's your
fault he didn't receive the Sacrament!
I told you... these condoms kill people.
And that is why, my dear Mate,
that I, as the Mayor of our town,
speak these words of gratitude
for your efforts in assembling the navy
on this island of ours,
and for your standing up with
the anti-fascist coalition.
Even today, we proudly remember
how you attacked German destroyers
frigates and submarines
from the small fishing boats.
Hitler's warships sailed
around our island in fear
because they knew
you were around.
May the soil be soft on you, may seas
be calm on the skies where you sail.
Stop! Stop! - What happened?
- My uncle died.
His funeral is tomorrow. - He started to
stink. Can't keep him in the house any more.
It's better we deal with it now, rather
then coming here again tomorrow.
Fucking rubber and tire,
what a disgrace!
What am I going to do without you...?
Those are of strawberry scent.
They're good for blow jobs.
I mean... because of the taste.
And those are for the men
with small dicks.
Those whose dicks are
up to 3.5 inches.
These are ribbed. They say these
are used most for ass-fucking.
Look, can you stop using such
disgusting vulgarities?!
There are other ways.
And these are for men whose...
penis... is longer than 9 inches.
Only George who works in the
fish restaurant buys those.
That's how I know he has...
the longest table leg on
the entire island.
Type doesn't matter.
What does matter is the
centre of the package.
This is where the top of the condom is.
And it prevents the semen from leaking.
Now... all it takes a narrow needle
to pierce it right through there and...
Do you get it?
The little hole is invisible to the eye,
and the semen can flow out easily.
And then... if it is the will of God,
the child will be conceived.
If it's not, it will not. And those who
are using them, thanks to us,
will not commit any sin.
And you will not commit
any sin piercing them.
And you won't get fired, either.
No, you won't... yes, yes...
- You scared the shit out of me!
The woman alone at home.
Alone. He shit himself, shit himself...
There was a war, a war; you're not a man,
God will punish you, you coward.
Coward, that's what you are,
a watery semen is in you, it is, it is.
Anna, go sunbathe elsewhere.
Go on. The beach is down that way.
You're riling, riling, it's in your eyes,
you're up to... Anna knows. Knows.
You've managed to play the country,
you can't play me. You're not a man.
You're not. I know it.
I'll come back in the morning, before work,
to collect the ones you'll pierce by then.
And... not a word!
And espe... Especially to Rev. Jacob.
Give me the newspapers...
and the thingy.
Mayor, now and then
a man should have fun!
They say, when you put it on, as
if you haven't, they are so thin.
All sold. Come back tomorrow.
Oh, Mister Teacher!
Here you go. How about my nephew
Stephen, any good at school?
There you go, another batch. I didn't
think you'd sell them so quickly.
During holidays, people usually
fuck more, pardon my language.
And all before they're married...
- The skies, the skies, good weather...
Skies, skies... and the sea...
good weather...
Skies, skies... - Where have you
found her?! - At the beach. Sunbathing.
You, beware! Jesus recovered!
Jesus... You can't! Beware!
Beware! Pray for yourself,
Reverend! For yourself, not me!
Jesus recovered! Woe is you! You
have eyes but you see nothing!
I will pray for you! Hallelujah...
STEPHEN
TRUMPETER GIRL
This is very complicated.
This is how things are going
for the past two weeks.
Spephen, Luka's son, he removes mines,
spends every other weekend with his folks.
When he's here, he is fucking...
He is meeting the Trumpeter Girl.
His father and mother
are not happy about it, at all.
Look what they're doing!
Vice Spanjic, the policeman, is meeting
Mara, the widow of late Trifun.
Oh, if my late husband was
to see me right now...
Paul's son is roaming around.
With? - You should know it better.
He confesses to you.
But according to my calculations,
he could be meeting at least three girls.
But I'm afraid one of the three
might be the daughter of our pastry cook,
Gashi Bedri, which could be very
dangerous. If he knocks her,
bad news for him. You're
aware of Albanian habits.
And this...
this is the greatest of all.
Mikula, the paraplegic.
- Who's he with?!
He... drives with his ex, Verica, her dad
works at the port administration.
When he got paraplegic, she
stopped walking with him.
It's a dead set she doesn't
want to marry one. But they fuck.
This should be ascertained immediately.
POLICEMAN, POSTMAN, GEORGE.
As for these three guys,
I don't know who they meet.
I've investigated them, I followed them,
but I have discovered nothing.
VINKO, THE TEACHER
This case is very specific.
I don't know about him.
He has three kids and
a pregnant wife,
but he bought two packages
during the last ten days. Vanilla ones.
Maybe he has to, because his wife is
pregnant or... something. I don't know.
Well, he can't make her another
child while she's pregnant...
I'm afraid he might be a...
- What?
A paedophile. - I beg your pardon?
See you... - See you!
...of the new and eternal
Covenant, which will be poured out...
...for you and for many...
...for the forgiveness of sins...
Do this in memory of me.
The secret of Faith.
He's out. - Do you math...
- He's eyeing the children.
Hello, Reverend?
He's wandering the graveyard.
How do you call those
who are into dead people?
He's looking at goats. How do you
call those who are into pets?
Hello? Error!
He's not into pets.
Now, see... they've been
meeting for two hours like this.
Spent three of our condoms.
Battery went dead so I couldn't
record it all.
And the weirdest thing is, one is the
right wing party and another, the left one.
So... you've pierced them all?
- We were selling hollow ones to everyone.
Except for the Mayor and the teacher.
Peter was selling them the
thickest ones he had.
And? Any results?
Nothing. In three months, not a single
wedding, not a single pregnancy.
And eight locals died.
The bell for the dead kept ringing...
How about we pierce wider holes?
It's not the size of the holes.
Marin is the problem. He sells
identical condoms, but they're not pierced.
We are covering only
half of the market.
We need to talk to him.
- He's beyond talking.
Why? - He's insane.
In Bosnian war, he was a medic.
They captured him twice.
He spent half a year in Serbian camp,
another half in a Muslim one.
Then the UN found him.
They couldn't tell who he is,
so they deported him.
It took him two months
to prove he is a Croat.
Since then, he's not particularly
fond of foreigners.
This summer, inspection almost
closed his pharmacy
'cause he wouldnt sell drugs to
people he thought were Serbs.
They left him here on the island only
because there was no replacement.
Well, we should talk to him.
There you go. So, our action of
piercing didn't go as expected.
Well, you've lost it, indeed.
You astonish me, Reverend.
I thought you were a
serious one. A man of reason.
Not ridged. And you...
and... Peter!
You are totally out of your mind!
You were doing all this,
leaving me out?!
We need to unite!
It's going to get worse than you think!
When we die, Muslims and
Orthodox will occupy the island!
Instead of your church, there
will be a mosque!
Instead of your bell tower,
a minaret!
And down the pier... orthodox priest
will drink coffee with hodja!
Accordingly... what you are doing
simply isn't enough.
We have to hit even harder!
And not only on men!
On women, too! There are women
avoiding pregnancy that much
they use anti-baby pills
and condoms at the same time!
Double protection.
Do you understand that?
I suggest I re-do the packages.
Instead of pills, I'll sell vitamins.
We'll strike from both sides.
On men and women, both!
And a pregnancy test.
30 kunas.
There! Thanks to us, Muslims
are converting to Christianity!
Here comes the next one.
If these weddings
and pregnancies continue,
it might happen for the first time
in the past 30 years
that the number of the dead
and of newly born is equal!
And the Pope will be satisfied
once I told him that.
The Pope? - I was invited to visit the Holy
Father with the teenagers from our parish.
Come in!
God Bless. - From now to eternity.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
- What happened?
My daughter, we sent her to study for
a hair dresses and she returns, woe is me...
Come on in, let the men see you!
Congratulations! - Well, congratulations
aren't in order, Rev. Jacob,
A girl with a child and no husband.
When her father comes back from the sea,
he's going to kill us!
- You should have been careful.
Those city boys... they promise
you ivory towers, and then...,
Those weren't the city boys, but ours.
Last summer, when this missus was on leave.
It is all right, then. The girl
must know who the father is.
Go on, tell them!
And what is this? - A list.
- What kind of list?
Of possible fathers. - Jorg...
- He's from Hungary, he's not of us.
A Norweigan. On summer vacation.
- Jürgen! - That's what he said.
Last name, address?
He didn't tell me those.
All right. We'll resolve this before your
father comes back. - God bless you.
Come on! Let's go.
And of all days, I'm having a football game
tomorrow, for the third veterans' league...
Don't you worry a thing.
I will take care of it all.
What's up?
I've summoned you here to tell you
that first thing tomorrow morning,
you have to go to town and
take blood tests. - Uh?
You can do the test here in the
emergency station, but it's better for all
if you did that in town, because...
it is about girl, our local,
little Vesna Bikic.
I know you all know her! She gave birth
and we don't know who the father is,
you know it well know that each of
you can be the child's father!
Reverend, I can't possibly be the dad,
I've been using them... condoms.
Peter from the newsstand can witness,
I was buying them at his place.
I was also buying mine there.
- I knew you would say such a thing.
The fact you used condoms
is no guarantee.
There are very clear instructions:
"A condom is never a 100% protection"
With forceful movements, the condom
bursts, and 3% of all may have a flaw.
How come all three of us ended up
with a flaw one? - Of 3 per cent!
Not necessarily. One is enough,
but we need to find out who he is.
Yea, he's right. I bought a lawn mower
made in Taiwan. It broke after 3 days.
Enough!
It is better we deal with it like
men, like Christians,
or would you prefer me calling upon
you from the altar, in front of all?
And bring those tests to me!
So, none of them is the father?
- Then the kid is Norwegian. - No.
This means we can choose the groom.
- Oh, no, out of the question!
And how do you plan to find the Norwegian,
ha? And the child will be called a bastard.
The best candidate for her is Jure. A Croat.
A Catholic. - So are the others.
Not all Croats are the same. To that
points, not all Catholics are the same!
Some of them, on paper only.
Jure's dad gave his life for Croatia.
Vlado isn't so bad. - No, but Jure is
of more quality as a Croat and a groom.
If I had a daughter, I'd prefer
her to marry Jure over Vlado.
Jure, do you take Vesna here,
to be your wife?
I do.
And for the end of the central
Journal, a very unusual news.
While Croatia is facing the
drastically low natality,
natality on a small Dalmatia island
increased for 70% in the past 6 months.
Drop dead! - Congratulations, Jure!
- Fuck you and your Taiwanese!
The baby boom news on the island
spread across the borders of our country.
Many married couples are
visiting this beautiful Adriatic island.
I'd like a postcard. - Choose. You have
them with church and these of the village.
No. I prefer this one.
Nada Surjak has a whole story.
The locals are satisfied with increased
number of guests out of the season.
It's been said that undersea
currencies strengthen fertility.
Some tourists went bathing
even in December.
We came here as soon as we heard. We bathe
every day and we've visited Medjugorje.
We hope we will get a child.
If you ask me, I would say it's a natality
tourism, which will enrich the tourist offer
in our little town, meaning that beside
the sun and the sea, we offer much more.
I disagree. We, the HDZ, think that present
city authorities are absolutely unprepared
for the beginning for the
forthcoming tourist season.
New zoning should have improved
the village's infrastructure, and
Mayor and his social party are
doing nothing to improve it.
Excuse me, I wasn't filling for you,
don't do that. - I wasn't talking up to now.
But you're talking right now!
- And you are filling me.
Please, can I say something constructive?
- Do tell! - Obvious opposed attitudes,
which we've come to expect, but
what is the position of Church, rev. Fabian?
The Church resents sensationalism
but cherishes each new life.
The media today is filled with the culture
of death, and married couples
avoid having children, so I would
quote His Holiness the Pope and
his slogan during his first
visit to Croatia: Don't be afraid.
Dear viewers, these were the last
news in today's Journal.
Visit this Adriatic pearl, the island
of love, as for these recent events.
I'm done with this! - So much
for today's news. - But why?
Side-effects occurred. - Have a
pleasant night. - What side-effects?
Foreigners! They started to
buy houses around here!
A married couple from Germany
bought a house here. So did a Serbian guy!
If this continues, we will
soon have Arabs around, as well!
Marin, would you please calm down.
We'll discuss it tomorrow.
Don't get mad, but in 2 years, the island
will be inhabited with blacks and Chinese!
I have fallen in love...
I have fallen in love with you.
With you.
Stop, stop, that's enough! Christina,
when you are about to sing
you neither look left nor right, but ahead,
because the Holy Father will be in front.
Let's go!
We are you little angels,
embrace us with your spirit.
Who is it? - It's me, Martha.
It's OK, thank you,
nothing needs cleaning in here.
I've come to resign. Let someone
else clean after you, 'cause I won't.
Wait! Just a second! Hold on!
If the salary is too low,
we can make an arrangement.
If it is for the Church, I'll work for
free! But for you? Thanks, not anymore!
What now? You're gonna tell me
you use this for blessings?
Easy! I will explain it all. Take a
closer look, you'll see is it's unused.
Of course it is, when you
prefer doing it without one!
No, no, no, no! I've been using it
for something completely different.
As far as I know, this is used for
one thing only! Good bye! - Martha.
Martha, wait... - Come listen to the song
for the Pope. - Just a second!
We are you little angels,
embrace us with your spirit.
Martha, I'll explain. - Not necessary,
thank you, I got it all by myself!
Rev. Fabian... - Wait, Luke. - My son got
killed. I wanted to see about the burial.
What happened? A mine? - A bear.
- What do you mean a bear?
A black one. While he was clearing
mines from the forest. A bear attacked him.
I was so afraid of those mines, and
the poor boy, got himself killed by a bear.
Dearest Stephen, I speak on your grave
on behalf of all your fellow citizens.
Your death proved that in Croatia, we are
not endangered by mines and explosives only,
abandoned and scattered around
by the occupying enemy,
but by beasts similar to them,
wolves, bears and wild boars.
Did you explain it to her?
- I'm not the one you should be afraid of.
What if somebody else
turns you in to the police?
Nobody will. They'll all think it happened
'cause they're such great lovers.
People have no money to raise children!
That is why they use it!
My late mother had no money,
she gave birth to six of us, nevertheless!
And three of six died.
- God giveth, God taketh away.
But now he can't give, when all
wear that nylon on their dicks!
Marin, please!
We have a deceased here!
They also use it because of the AIDS.
- Anti-Croatian politics!
AIDS is a problem now?
And Croatian nation dying out is not?
I paid attention to sell the pierced
ones to Croats only. - Hush!
I plead from this place, it is about time
that hunting societies enable our deminers
normal working conditions!
Croatia free of mines...
I have sent a letter to the Bishop.
- What letter?
I was angry with you so I sent a letter,
along with that condom I found.
And why didn't you tell us that right away?
- I forgot. - When the post leaves?
On a ship, at four.
- Quickly, we might make it.
They have to understand that
human life is the most important of all.
We promise, dear Stephen, we shall
do it all so you haven't died in vain.
Rest in peace and may almighty God
make this earth a resting abode upon you,
because you loved Croatia so much.
Reverend has a stomach urgency. Figs.
He'll be back soon. Peter will help him.
Christina! Christina, let us know
once you've arrived! - Stop!
And you listen to the priest!
Here, they are coming back!
Let us pray.
What happened? - Good news.
I think your late son Stephen will become
a father in seven or eight months.
Here, Peter and Marin will explain.
Few days ago, the trumpeter, a girl
Stephen is seeing, came to my stand.
The girl he was seeing...
She bought a postcard with a photo of
a baby. When I was putting on a stamp,
I saw her writing: Come quickly,
important news, kiss.
And yesterday, after they took away the
coffin, she came by my pharmacy.
I recorded her buying a pregnancy test
with my mobile phone.
She obviously wanted to check
once more if she's pregnant or not.
After this, she went straight home.
It took her exactly 15 minutes,
to have a piss and make the test.
Peter recorded it. - Then she went to the
emergency, so the test was positive.
And she didn't stay long. - On our island,
there's no equipment for an abortion.
That's why she sent to port administration
building, where she bought a ferry pass.
Because, considering it all, she decided
to make an abortion on the mainland.
There. You see not all is so bad.
No, no. no! Hush!
No, no, don't cry!
Oh, my God, what a beautiful child!
If I haven't found it, it would freeze!
It is a pure infanticide!
Look, Peter, what a beautiful child!
- Indeed, he is!
Is it a boy or a girl?
- I don't know. I haven't checked.
A boy! A little boy! - We must call
the police. You'll witness it.
If you tell anyone about the child,
I'll tell everyone about you piercing.
What? - You've heard me.
You don't think we can keep it
a secret that we found it?
I don't think of secrets.
I can say I gave it a birth.
This is the last chance for
me and Peter to have a baby.
Look at the way he's watching us!
- If you want a child, adopt one!
There are orphans. I will help.
I will write my recommendation.
We can't. - Why? - I'm not allowed,
because I'm officially insane.
Insane, you? - When the war started,
I was looking for a way to skip it.
I had this doctor who put me into asylum
so now the law won't allow me adopt.
Because they think I am mentally ill!
Don't you cry! Don't you cry.
Oh, let's go. Yes, we're going home.
He's wet.
Wait. Wait, wait! How do you mean,
a birth? It's not the Middle Ages,
You need the gynaecologists certificate,
even I can't enlist him without it.
Marin will help. He knows lots of doctors.
- And money can handle everything.
Don't worry, Reverend. He might have
been meant to be our son, after all.
Maybe he's conceived thanks
to our piercing!
What? - The trumpeter girl. - You didn't
tell her I told you about the pregnancy?!
No. But as a Reverend, we thought
you might persuade her against the abortion.
Luke, I've done what I could.
- Try and understand, Reverend.
That conceived child might be
the only thing left behind our son.
As if I hear a child crying? - The cats.
- Cats? - It's their mating season.
Is that right, Reverend?
- I wouldn't know about that.
Marin! Hey, Marin!
What? - Open up, it's important.
Where're you going? - I'm not. I came for
baby food and diapers. I became a father.
When? - Minutes ago.
Since your boyfriend got killed, I know
it's not easy to decide and give birth.
And it might not be a coincidence.
- What?
That child you are carrying.
It might all be a part of God's plan.
Maybe God wanted that someone
stays behind after he's gone.
Stephen didn't want it.
We used protection and...
I really don't know how it happened.
If it is God's will that a child
is conceived amongst a man and a woman,
nothing will prevent it.
We are Christians, we believe in afterlife.
And late Stephen, if you asked him now,
he would probably want that child.
How am I supposed to do it, all alone?
You won't be alone. There's no finer job
for a woman than that of being a mother.
Easy for you to say, rev. Fabian.
Where would I go?
I earn a bit by playing on
burials, but that's all.
Church will help you.
All she has to do is give him a
birth, the rest is on us.
We will raise him, feed him,
educate him...
There are only these 20 days
critical for abortion, and that's all.
Readings from the Acts of the Apostles.
In those days, many came to
Faith and turn to the Lord.
News reached the ears of Jerusalem,
and they sent Barnabus to Antioch.
When he came and saw...
and he saw...
Congratulations. - ... the grace of God!
He was glad! - Congratulations.
- Thank you! - What do you expect?
A son. We went for an ultrasound.
Eine kleine dickling.
and he exhorted them all to remain faithful
to the Lord with steadfast purpose.
You went completely berserk!
- Don't worry. Marin took care of it all.
We tell everyone that Martha went
to the mainland to see the gynaecologist,
and that he stated the pregnancy.
So it won't be weird when Florian is born.
What Florian? - Well,
that's the name for the christening.
Marin agreed to be the God-father.
But her belly looks like she's
six months pregnant already!
But that's on purpose too!
She'll be carrying shorter.
Good afternoon. - Good afternoon.
Vlado is yet learning, he'll do it all by
himself, I am here more of...
...if he fucks something up.
On the 27. day of the month...
the day before yesterday,
we've opened an... - Investigation.
- Investigation. A girl is missing.
I am beginning the interview.
- Informative. - Informative interview.
You know many people here in the village,
someone might have told you something.
I... I don't understand, who is missing?
- The little trumpeter from burials.
Since when she is missing? - Before... her
mom reported... -Day before yesterday.
She has travelled away? - Investigation
revealed she bought a ferry pass,
But for the moment, there are
no... - Witnesses?
Witnesses who could corroborate the fact.
Please, if you hear or find out anything,
let us know as soon as possible.
Yes, yes, of course. - Let's go.
We should let Luka know.
- What? - That they're looking for her.
Why? - I thought you know.
- What?!
Luka locked her.
You advised him so.
Locked her? Where? - She's there on the
attic since the night you spoke to her.
You said, the most important thing is not
to abort until that abortion time is over.
Wait, look... - Don't you worry a bit.
She doesn't lack a thing here.
The wife cooks warm meals for her.
I brought in a TV so she can watch series.
We will let her go as soon as
the abortion time is behind her.
I am sorry, but I have to notify the police.
- Then you better prepare for burials.
There's lot of weapons here
left from my deceased son.
And I will defend his child
instead of him.
Jure! Jure, where is the police?
- They went to the mainland for a dog.
The hound. Said theyd search the
entire island to find the trumpeter.
Jesus, what a machine!
It's either a tycoon or a Mafioso.
It's the Bishop.
You shit your pants, Reverend,
shit your pants.
Jesus walked the seas, he did, and he did.
He could walk, and you can't,
you can't... - Let go, Anna.
Let go, get off to the beach!
- You shit you pants, Reverend... - Scoot!
I believe I can explain it all.
I don't know how to begin...
Unofficially. It's better you use it,
unlike some irresponsible priests,
who produce babies.
But... but I don't use it. - What,
you are doing it without that?
That's not what I meant.
I don't use it at all.
Who with? - What do you mean,
who with? - Who with you are not using it?
It matters to me that it is
not the children.
No, for Christ's sake, no!
- But why are you wondering?
You see what our brothers in Ireland,
America, Belgium... Netherlands...
Australia... - I know, that is...
but this is not about... that.
So, it does not include underage persons?
- No! - Then it is all right.
Look, Your Eminence,
I have to admit something.
I did it for the Church.
Because the island is dying.
I pierced holes in condoms
for the sake of natality, you understand?
Those who are using it,
they actually don't use it.
For the past months, I've managed to make
a balance between the dying and newly born.
It was on TV.
I've heard it all from the priest. They
told me stories, but such an excuse...
That is ingenuous. Ingenious.
No, no! Ingenious!
Well done!
All that matters to me is that
no children are involved.
In which case I would have to
redistribute you.
I am glad it was nothing serious.
You will soon be alone in the parish.
And where will rev. Jacob go? - Don't tell,
but he will serve at the Capitol.
I'm glad. - That idea of yours,
piercing... it's very good.
We might try and apply it
on the level of the state.
I will talk about it with
the Archbishop. Ingenious!
<b>J O S E</b>
Sound insulation. My invention. I've
insulated everything with three layers.
Glass fibre, Styrofoam and egg boxes.
The kid can cry and nobody will hear.
Two things. First, we stop piercing condoms.
It all went sideways. And second,
we have to make a plan to save the
Trumpeter. Marin will come in a minute.
Why us? - Be... because it's
our fault she's on the attic!
They can't touch us! Marin and me,
we both erased it all from our phones.
I'd rather that trumpeter gets him
the child, than having crazy Luka kills me,
now that we finally have a child of our own.
- Indeed, people know he's packing a lot.
It's just talking, there
won't be any guns there!
There. Choose. - And what is that?
- For self-defence, if he starts shooting.
No. No, Marin, no!
- You know he's armed.
Marin, please! No weapons!
Let's go. It's time. He stopped crying.
Where do you think you're going? - To the
Lighthouse, kid needs some fresh air.
Once I dried prosciutto on that attic.
I think there's a little window on the roof.
Hush! Someone's coming!
You stay here. I'm going to climb up.
You might need this.
Miss... we came to set you free.
I knew you were about to try something!
Now I have to close you in, too.
Throw the gun away.
I said we'll need the weapons.
Throw your gun. - Woman, let go! It might
shoot accidentally, guns aren't for you!
Get in.
Marin!
She must go to the hospital at once!
Stash the kid!
Good evening!
"Yesterday, teenagers from Croatia
had the audience at Holy Father's...
Dressed in their folklore costumes,
they've performed several songs.
This made Benedict XVI very happy and
he talked heartedly to young believers."
It's not good, Reverend.
- Is she going to make it?
That, she will. But I'm afraid
she won't be able to have kids.
And... if we were to take here
somewhere else for treatment?
Our parish... we will collect the money.
- I am sorry. You've waited for too long.
You made it home, my dear!
- Have you listened? She was great!
Excellent. The Pope was simply thrilled.
That's the German. He drowned. They say,
a heart attack due to freezing sea water.
I brought you the Pope's book.
Signed.
I have a confession to make.
You have wronged plenty, Rev. Fabian.
But your mistakes were not of evil intent,
they are not offensive to God.
You've followed the Holy Gospel spirit,
but you were naive.
You've forgotten the first pages of Bible,
that we are creatures with flaws.
Some flaws cannot be repaired,
but some of them can.
The most important thing is the child.
A woman who left the baby
didn't necessarily renounce it.
Martha's pregnancy is a lie,
and lie gives birth to evil.
You have to find the child's mother.
Jose. A Serbian name!
José. A Spanish name.
If you ask me, little Vicka, Mara and
Verica are the most likely suspects!
God Bless. - From now to eternity.
Christina, you'll sing during the Mass?
She can't. She said her throat is soar.
She caught a cold back in Rome.
Here. I brought binoculars.
- What binoculars? You're insane.
Take a vantage point and
observe if someone is acting strangely.
Especially these three.
- What do you mean, strangely?
Just observe! And find your
spot down the altar.
For the Lord sets
a father in honour over his children
and confirms
a mothers authority over her sons.
Those who honour their father atone for sins;
they store up riches who respect their mother.
Those who honour their father will have joy
in their own children,
and when they pray they are heard.
Those who honour
their father will live a long life;
those who obey the Lord,
will honour their mother.
My son, be steadfast
in honouring your father
help him in old age,
do not grieve him as long as he lives
Even if his mind fails,
be considerate of him
do not revile him
because you are in your prime
Kindness to a father will not be forgotten
it will serve as a sin offering,
it will take lasting root
Thus saith the Lord...
Let go!
Poor Anna. She took a vow
of kneeling for a year,
just to prevent her child
get sick the way she did.
But who would fuck her? I've controlled
the place. She didn't even cross my mind.
But, it is all good. You will provide
much better care for him.
I don't even think about it!
You don't know that family!
We told you how her brother
did wrong to their old father.
And how he ended... As far as I know,
such illnesses are genetic.
But perhaps Florain,
growing up surrounded by love,
doesn't have to get sick. - Yes, he
doesn't have to, and he might, as well.
He might grow to be sicker
than his mother is.
I will talk to Martha.
Leave that to me.
She won't trust you. She'll say you made
it up just to separate her from the child.
You find nothing strange on this kid?
- Strange, how?
I don't know, I mean...
does it bite or something...
How can he? He didn't even
grow teeth. Why do you ask?
What if there illnesses in his family...
- Well, if he's ill, he's ours.
I despise those who renounce
their child because they're ill.
Come on, sit down,
the food's getting cold.
Do you have a prescription? - Why do I
need it for? - I can't give it to you.
You can't sell vitamins instead of
anti-baby pills!
Here! But careful! These are
the strongest sleeping pills!
Just one, before going to sleep.
- Do you have it in powder?
I find it hard to swallow a pill.
- Crush it and you'll get a powder.
Hey, priest! You asleep?
Yeah, sleep on, motherfucker.
You fucked up my life,
what you did.
We are returning him. There's a
soother, food and a few diapers inside.
And... Martha? - I'll deal with that.
- Florian got used to you. It's a sin!
Yes. But I found out where crazy Anna
was for 9 months before we've found him.
Hospitalised, in an asylum! It means
he's not a result of our condoms!
It means his father is also sick or
even sicker than his mother!
And what am I supposed to do
with him? - Put him in a centre.
He'd have ended up there anyway
if we didn't take him.
Everything is easier... - What now?!
- Then my life with you...
And I beg you, and I beg you...
just for one more day...
Get in, don't let Rev. Jacob sees us!
And I beg you...
just for one more day...
And then I can even die...
floating into a dream.
One life with you is not enough...
- Reverend! - One life with you...
Peter! - Take him. - I have to
bring Jure down. - I have to go, too!
Wait. We first have to lure him down!
Martha.
She's calling you know. - She'll get
suspicious if none of us answers.
Just say you have no clue
about things.
Give him the soother! The soother!
Hello, yes?
No, I haven't seen him.
Fuck it, the soother fell out.
One life with you is not enough...
and heart is not ashamed
to kneel down in front of you.
Hey, Jure! - And I beg you... -Come
down! You are disturbing people!
And I beg you...
Reverend! Hey! - Just for one more day...
Where are you going?
- Reverend, hurry, Reverend!
Listen, folks!
Don't buy condoms at Peter's!
They're for fuck!
I mean, they're not.
Where is he? - He just left.
Martha, he isn't here!
He's not here! Peter took him away!
You'll wake up Rev. Jacob. - He might
be the Pope, I couldn't care less!
Fly, fly, away and far...
...My little swallow,
from my heavens, the shiny star...
Jure, come down, I beg you.
Your child needs you.
Fuck off, priest!
Fly, fly, away and far...
Hush, hush...
Peter!
They will take him away from me.
I live for today, don't think of tomorrow,
we all wander in our separate sorrow.
This world is but crazy rush...
I live for today, don't think of tomorrow.
Give us another one!
It's better he sings.
He won't jump while singing.
You know that one,
"Let me die tonight"?
Son! Son!
Mamma! - My son!
Mamma, go back home!
- Get down right now! - Mamma!
You heard me? - Mamma, go back!
- Down or I'll throw myself into the sea!
You - to your grave,
me - into mine.
Folks! Folks, get hold of her!
She can't even swim!
Mamma... - There!
Over there, folks!
I have a confession to make.
It was me, who did it.
I realised that was the only
reason he asked for confession.
So he can force me to silence.
I was the greatest threat for him.
And he knew...
If he confessed to me all
about little Christina in a confession,
same as I confided in him,
he knew I would never break
the Seal of Confession.
But you have just told me everything.
- I did. In a confession.
It still remains secrecy.
What are you going to do with it?
Thanks to our Holy Sacrament,
it will all remain between us.
And... the police?
They found nothing?
They did.
Obduction's results shown
the girl was pregnant.
What they don't know is that the father
is your newly appointed Assistant Bishop.
Say the Sacrament of Penance.
There is no need... there is no point
we give absolutions to each other.
Fortunately, I have my tumour.
And you... how will you go on?
That, I don't know.
So long. - No. Go with God.
God Bless.
I have a confession to make.
