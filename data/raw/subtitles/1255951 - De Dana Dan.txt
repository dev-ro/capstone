Many of your cheques have bounced..
..I've been searching aII overfor you,

That's my daddy, Harbansh Chadda.
Where is he?

But your receptionistjust

She must be referring to me.
You see, I'm Chadda and

Whenever I come here, he's aIways

I've just four months
Ieft to retire.
And, I want to apprehend
that fraudster before that.
In aII my years of poIice service..

Inform me as soon as he returns.
Otherwise, I'II be compeIIed

Let go.

Let go, you dog.
Let go. Let go.

I'm going to deduct eight months saIary.
I want to say something.
- Say it.
If this continues.
Then I'II never be abIe to repay the Ioan that,
my father borrowed from you.
Every time..
Every time I try to do something good
that dog ruins everything.
You dare caII him dog.
He's my son.

Behave respecftuIIy with him.
CaII him, Mr. MuIchand.

Go and apoIogise to him.
What wiII you say?
Sorry, Mr. MuIchand.
- Yes. Now go and get my car ready.
I'm getting Iate for office,
because of you.
Here we go.
Be quick, you donkey.
What's this audacity?
First you tore my cIothes.
And, now you tore your
own cIothes as weII.
Madam, my suit was aIways torn.
There are hoIes everywhere.
The buttons are dangIing.
I've been using this suit with the heIp

Come on, Madam.
Buy me a new suit.
Didn't your father wear

But he never compIained.
DiwaIi is approaching.
I'm fIat broke.
I'm your driver

I've thought of something for DiwaIi.
You wiII Iike it.

No bonus.
Look at the price before
pIacing the order. Got it?
One..
- Yes, dad.
Yeah.
What's wrong, daddy?
- That officer has come here too.
But he doesn't know you,
what's the probIem?
But, that other fooIaIong

He fiIed a case against
me for bounced cheques.
I know, when that moustached
man arrives teII him.
That I had to Ieave for an
urgent meeting. Get it?
And, you see the girI and

Come, dear come.

Hi, I'm pammi.

If you two want to taIk in private

It's a good thing to know each
other before getting married.
Go, go dear.
At the corner?
You're so young.
You don't Iook Iike Nonny's mother at aII.
I'm not Nonny's mother.
I'm Chadda's second wife.
Look, I Iove someone eIse.
And, I'm pregnant with his chiId.
- What?
My daddy asked me
not to teII you this.
But, if you're ready to
accept someone eIse's chiId
Then, I'm ready too.
Look, if you don't marry her we won't
get the rest of the dowry.
And, if we don't get the dowry
how wiII we repay the debts.
But..
- I need to repay so many..
Nine arrest warrants have been
issued against me.
But, Daddy she says
that she's pregnant.
So what?
It's a scheme.
Just Iike, get a comb free
on a pack of soap.
It's such an interesting offer.
You'II marry the girI,
and get the chiId free.
But, daddy the chiId beIongs
to someone eIse..
Be quiet, and eat your food.
You wiII get married at any cost.
Eat your food.
- Daddy.
This is my daughter,
Manpreet Singh Oberoi.
And this is my brother-in-Iaw..
Mr. paramjeet Singh Lamba,
Indian Ambassador.
And, this is Mrs. Lamba.
I've heard a Iot about you, sir.
I'm very pIeased to meet you.
- Thank you.
In India, DiwaIi is ceIebrated
by pIaying cards.
It's the same here too.
Do you see that?
They're one of the richest
famiIies in Singapore.
Mr. Brijmohan Oberoi.
He has enough money to
Iast four generations.
ReaIIy?
- But, he has onIy one daughter.
But the pIanet Mars is

He requires a boy that

OnIy then can she get married.
Otherwise, everything is useIess.
Bet. Bet.

Come on, give me a hug.
We're originaIIy from India.
- ReaIIy.
And settIed down here with

But, there's something that's
irritating me. - What?
We get to meet onIy

Otherwise, the entire day

What's the use of this money?
- You're absoIuteIy right.
My son, Nonny.
- Nonny Chadda. - Okay. Hi.
He's from Harvard.
And, he's a top cIass graduate.
- Okay.
But it's useIess.
- Why?
He isn't getting married.
- What are you saying?
God has made such a
pecuIiar horoscope of his.
Look. The girI and the boy shouId

And, she shouId have mars

Now, where wiII I find such a girI?
pIease continue, pIaying Mr. Oberoi.
Daddy.
Excuse me, I'II be right back.
- Yes.
Daddy, what's wrong with

Since you were born,

One day, Lord Ganesha asked Lord Shiva
''When wiII I get married?''
So, Lord Shiva didn't know
what answer to give..
So, he said ''Tomorrow''.
The next day, Lord Ganesh asked again
''When wiII I get married?''
Lord Shiva repIied, ''Didn't I say, tomorrow?
- Yes.''
''Then come tomorrow.''
The third day, Lord Ganesh asked again
and Lord Shiva repIied,''Tomorrow.''
So this way, Lord Ganesh kept asking and,
Lord Shiva kept repIying, tomorrow.
This way, Lord Ganesh never got
married nor did Lord Shiva Iie.
But, why are you teIIing me this story?
Because, in our story I'm Lord Ganesh
and, you're Lord Shiva.
And, this can't continue aII our Iives.
My marriage has been fixed.
Mannu, you know what my condition is.
I've reached this far
with debts worth miIIions.
If I don't repay the debts..
..then, my mother and sister
wiII be thrown on the streets.
And, I'm working hard..
..and, not wasting away my time.
Try to understand
my condition as weII.
My marriage is on the 20th.
Father has fixed everything.
But stiII, if you caII me before
the Iast nuptiaI round..
..I'II come back to you.
I can't promise you
anything more, Ram.
Come out, come out.
What happened?
I heard that your son is
marrying someone eIse.
Good that you heard about it.
I was worried thinking
about how to teII you this.
What do you think I am?
You take dowry from me..
..and get your son married
to someone eIse.
You gave me that money..
..because your daughter is pregnant.
And, you want us to bear that burden.
If you say anything
against my daughter..
..I'II rip your tongue out.
Look at that.
Your daughter can do
aII the wrong things..
..but, we can't even speak about it.
My son wiII get married

Then Iisten to me, I don't want
your fooIish son. - Fine.
My daughter wiII find someone better.

Just return me my money, that's aII.

You get your daughter married at 12:29.
Write it down, don't forget.
There's no need to write it down.

The daughter's inteIIigent

Madam, it's the eve of DiwaIi,

Look at this.
I've kept my pants up with a string.

Fire me from this job.

But first, repay the Ioan..

I have the papers

Do you know?
Do you know?
They fIog you.
Do you want to go?

When there'II be wrinkIes on my face.
WiII you marry me then?
Look, Nitin

Fine, then come on.
That's good.
Let's go to my home,

Where we'II get rotten food,

ShaII we go?
I'm ready.
- Are you got mad?
You've Iived such a Iife of Ieisure.
And, now you want to
Iive Iike a pauper.
You mean to say..
..we shouId forget aII the
dreams that we've seen.
Every time I get a
proposaI for marriage..
..I make different excuses,
and avoid the subject.
And this time,
you're trying to avoid me.
Look, Nitin my father has
fixed my marriage.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- Thanks.
Why don't you say something?
What can I say?
Do you have a soIution?
Oh yes, just say nice meeting you.
Hey. Wait, wait.
Here..
Here take this too.
Beggar.
I'II commit suicide.
You fooI, stupid.
Is this the way to stop a car?
If I had deIayed even a second..
..you wouId've been crushed
under the car.
Who asked you to appIy the brakes?
I was committing suicide.
I cannot even die in peace now.
CouIdn't you find any
other car in Singapore..
..that you hurIed
yourseIf in front of my car?
CouIdn't you think of
any other way?
I tried many things.
I thought of consuming poison..
..but, I didn't have any money
to buy them.
I tried to hang myseIf..
..but the rope turned out to be expensive.
I decided to set myseIf abIaze
but then,
I found out that petroI is
more expensive than rope.
Why are you so eager to die?
So, why shouId I be keen to Iive?
You know, at times AnjaIi
wouId give me money.
But now she's getting married as weII.
Now, I don't have that
source of income either.
Don't be tense.
Come, Iets sit in the van.
Go somewhere, and think
peacefuIIy and then decide.
What?
And, if it's a good pIan,
then I'II join you too.
Come on.
The one I Iove is getting married too.
Don't go anywhere aIone.
I'II just deIiver this courier.
Listen, be back soon.
We've to decide today.
Lao Tsao.
He spoke against me.
Listen, sIit his tongue.
He's been going overboard using it.
peopIe shouId know my name is Mamu.
Mamu. Courier for you.
Mamu, what's in this courier
that it's so heavy.
Nothing speciaI, I askedmy peopIe in
Hong Kong to be head someone.
It must be his skuII.
Maybe. I don't know.
He was getting too hot headed.
So, I just caImed him down.
So, how are you?
WouId you Iike to have a beer?
Bye.
Yes,
Get me some beer..
What were you saying?
Nitin, if we both die..
..who wiII be at Ioss?
We, isn't it?
I say, Iets be positive.
Who knows, there couId be a miracIe..
..and our fates might change.
I've been thinking the samething
for the past 20 years.
There's aIways a miracIe,
but our Iife gets worse.
You never know when fate
destiny might change.
Take Mamu for exampIe,
from that China..
He wouId pick garbage
and seII them.
And, sIeep right here.
And, that too just five years ago.
And now, his Iuck has
changed for the better.
How does their Iuck change?
When the government imposed
heavy duty on cigarettes..
..he wouId go to MaIaysia
buy cigarettes and seII them here.
That's how he started.
And then, he switched to steaIing,
pimping, hooIiganism.
That's how he became a don.
I am teIIing you.
Even you shouId do something Iike this.
This is not a nice country,
Iike ours.
If you're caught steaIing here,
they behead you.
In our country,
if we know any infIuentiaI man..
..we can get baiIed out.
But, if we don't get caught.

We don't need to do anything.
Now, the poIice wiII do

When I took you aIong, I knew

Where did you get that piece ofjunk from?
The junk seIIer?
Why are you bIaming me

Kidnapping isn't my business.
So, am I giving Iessons on kidnapping?
- Be quiet.
You brought that piece of crap..

And, that dog ran away from it..
..aIong with your 10 miIIion.

Go, die and come back.
What now?
I need IittIe time to think.
In a surprising turn of events,
Ms. Kaur has refused..
..to pay the ransom
demanded by the kidnappers.
This decision has
sparked a pubIic upheavaI..
..amongst the IocaI
Indian community.
She has so much weaIth.
Can't she give some
money and save his Iife?
I won't pay a singIe penny to save him.
Have you got that?
I think, we Indians shouId get together..
and, hoId a demonstration against her.
And, stop going to her maII.
''I didn't feeI any shame,
I danced so vigorousIy.''

Don't worry, Mamu.
I've a strong medicine that can knock

Then, I'II throw him

The poIice wiII think

Either you pay the ransom and get Nitin back.
- Or return us our deposit.
We don't want to run
our shops in your maII.
Where are you going?

No, I thought of many things.
Do you want to know? TeII me.
Go back to that witch and teII her that you

SimpIe.
Or eIse, I suggest that you go to

And, AnjaIi stop thinking.
Go back to your father and,
teII him that you've changed your mind.
You'II have a better Iife.
Hey, excuse me, what've you
thought about yourseIf?
I've thought of postponing
my suicide for a few days.
I'm thinking, that I'II see an astroIoger..
and, ask him which is the best day to die.
So, that I die on a good day. And, my souI
doesn't have to beg around Iike me.
So, if you don't find a good day..
you wiII never die.
No. - That means you've
decided to Ieave.
Yes, I've decided to Ieave.
- Confirmed.
Come on, then cIose this.

CIose it, quickIy and get out now.

you kidnapped me. Now go.
You're back to your

And, aren't you trying to cheat me?
You cheat.

I haven't even seen his wife.
Kamini, you're mistaken.
Liar! Rogue!
The other day, that moustached man
barged into his room, and beat him..
..he didn't do it without a reason.
He must have barged in his room,
and done something.
I haven't been to anyone's room nor,

Who is spreading such rumours?
Bring him before me.
We've pacified him for now..
..do you want to gather
everyone around again?
Then, Iet everyone know.
I want to know as weII.

She must've come here to steaI.
CaII the poIice.

Hey. I didn't come here to steaI.

I caIIed you?
Didn't you caII me here?
Remember our deaI.
Either you'II marry me,
or give me money.
Oh, God.
- I didn't say anything Iike that.
I'II sIap you if you say that.
Then, what did you say?
I said, I'II come to your room

And you said I'II come

So, it's true that you caIIed her here.
Because..
- Shut up.
If you say another word,
I'II forget how oId you are.
I want to die.

You've defamed the entire famiIy

Aren't you ashamed of

What shaII I do?
ShaII I wait or Ieave?
Get Iost, or eIse I'II throw you

She's that type of a woman.
Hey, don't scream at me.

Do you've poison?
Fine, I'II teII you aII the truth.
I don't know any such girI.

give the money to anyone.
What? You didn't teII me?
No.
You didn't teII me?
- No.
You dare Iie.
I'II skin you aIive.
What are you doing?
Have you come here
to ruin the marriage?
To defame the famiIy honour.
That man is Iying.
If you taIk anymore nonsense then,
I'II break your teeth.
Quiet.
Forgive me.
I feeI ashamed to say that,

Where is the money?
We've to get out of here any how.
They're waiting outside for me

How many wives and chiIdren he has?
What wiII I teII them?
Where is my shoe?
What shaII we do now?
CaII up Mamu, and ask him
to get hoId of anyone..

What wiII we do with the dead body?
We're cannibaIs,

We'II throw it in a Iake or pond..
and, teII the poIice his description.
Come on, now.
CaII Mami.. I mean, Mamu.
We've traced the number
of the kidnapper.
90669224. He caIIed you
from this number.
Then, find out who he is?
- His name is Harbansh Chadda.
Oh, but you know what?
You aII are the same.
Doctor, he has come to his senses.
- I don't think that he wiII..
Oh! Okay.
He has regained consciousness.
Can you describe the kidnapper?
Can you describe the kidnapper?
What's wrong?
Have you gone deaf?
They are asking for the description
of the kidnapper. TeII them,
Who am I?
What am I doing here?
If I sIap him once,
he'II remember everything.
ShaII I remind you who you are?
I'm your maid, now do you remember?
Do you remember?
pIease don't disturb him,
he has Iost his memory.
Memory.
- Not on the ground, on the bed.
Sir, we have a sketch of the kidnapper..
as per the eye-witness.
The kidnapper was driving the van.
And, he fIed after the van met
with an accident.
God, Iook at his face.
He Iooks Iike a ferocious criminaI.
You have his name,
number and photo.
What eIse are you waiting for,
his horoscope? Look for him,
We've traced the caII.
It was made from pacific hoteI.
He must be hiding in some
corner of that hoteI. Go.
Come with me.
- I'II come too.
And, when I Iay my hands on him,
I'II teach him a good Iesson..
And then, I'II give you
a sound beating.
I'm in a fix.
They have my sketch.
If they catch me, I'm..
How did they know we were
in the same hoteI?
Who did I kidnap?
It's Mamu's caII. I'II teII him we
don't need the corpse.
Because the poIice think
you are the kidnapper.
Okay. Go ahead. TeII him, teII him.
HandIe everything.
HeIIo.
I'm waiting outside the hoteI
with the dead body.
What shouId I do with it?
- We don't need the dead body now.
Why don't you want it?
With great difficuIty,
I stoIe it from the morgue.
You wiII have to buy it.
I don't want it.
You can seII it to someone eIse.
This is not some vegetabIe
that peopIe buy over the counter.
You don't know who I am.
The whoIe of Singapore
is scared of me.
If.. - What are you doing?
Why are you taIking so IoudIy?
Someone eIse ishaving a
conversation too. Speak softIy.
Yes. - What can I say?
Iknow you're in this hoteI.
I wiII find you, no matter what?
Come on.
I said I don't want it.
You can do whatever you want.
What wiII I do with the dead body?
And, you can die aIong with him.
But spare me.- Spare me, spare me.
- Hey, why are you screaming now?
HeIIo, where are you? - When you
scream, I can't hear anything.
Nitin, Iet's go.
Mamu.
I trusted you, and brought the
dead body without the advance.
And, now you say you don't
want the dead body.
You're the rascaI. I gave
50% advance to your man.
Who did you give it to?
When did you give it?
The one whom you sent
to coIIect the advance.
But he said there wasn't
anyone there.
You're Iying.- You're Iying.
- So what if he said so?
You want money, don't you?
I'II give it. I'II get it from the room. Come on.
But I gave the advance..
- But, do come back.
And, you'II have to pay
for the coffin as weII.
Why?- The coffin doesn't
come for free.
Fine, we'II pay you.- pay me.
- Bag.- Come on.
We don't have to see the money..
..we need to fIee with it. Come on.
Who are you?
Swami Krishna Murari.
- Why do you want to kiII him?
I was asked to kiII him.
- To kiII you?
Not me, I was toId you kiII you.
- Who was it?
It's the principIe of our business.
We never reveaI the party's name, sir.
To heII with your principIes.
You can beat me as
much as you want, sir.
But I won't teII you his name.
I can give his photo.
You're Iying, scoundreI.
If you didn't ask him to kiII him..
..then, how did he get
hoId of this photograph?
The photograph proves nothing.
I've Mahatma Gandhi's
photograph in my house.
Does that mean I ordered
to assassinate him?
Sir, forget the photograph..
..he aIso paid memoney to kiII him.
When did I give you money?
- I haven't written down the date.
And he said,''I'II pay you the rest..
when I see his dead body.''
Sir, I won't Iie.
It's my business.
Was he aIone, or was there
someone eIse with him?
Sir, there was chicken curry
in my eyes.
That's why, I couIdn't recognise..
..the one who gave me money.
Oh, so you eat from your eyes.
This is a conspiracy. A conspiracy.
It's this trickster's pIan to canceI the marriage.
That's canceIIed anyway. And, return
me aII the money that I gave you.
What money? - You thief, your wife
took the money from me.
Ask her to return me my money.
I'II sIap you siIIy.
He's Iying.
Go ask your wife, whether she took
the money from me or not?
She took money from you too?
She took money from me as weII.
She has cheated many
peopIe with her beauty.
And him.. he's her pimp.
You rascaI, don't you dare..
Who is this rascaI?
I've never seen him before?
Who is he? Who Ieft him back here?
Oh, God I was sending my
daughterin such a disgusting famiIy.
I want my money back right now.
Right now.
- I don't understand anything.
Let me expIain..
first get your wife here.
Do you want to pounce
on her again?
LusftuI.. I'II bring her wherever you want.
Butjust see that no one moves from here.
I'II be right back.
pammi. pammi. pammi.
- What?- Why?
Another man.. my money.
- My money.
Sir, pIease try to get
my money back as weII.
What? Look, no one wiII
move untiI we know the truth.
Come on, sit here, sit here, sit down.
- But, why aren't you arresting him?
Sir, I cannot arrest him
on the basis of this photo.
Why are you here?
You must have heard about
the Bankar kidnapping.
That smaII boy.
SmaII boy? He's a grown up. Like an ox.
His kidnappers are hiding in this hoteI.
ReaIIy? What is his name?
- Chadda?
Chadda?
- Chadda?
Ferocious criminaI.
The poIice has been Iooking
for him for many years.
But WiIson, I don't understand..
why you don't arrest him?
Sir, I tried to catch him but every time,
he fooIs me and gives me the sIip.
That fooI was standing right before you.
Why didn't you catch him?
Who? Your reIative?
- Oh, so he's the one.
I know where he is.
Come on...
BIoody heII.
He's.. he's the one. Here he is.
Where are you running off too?
Where is my money?
What money?
When you snatched the money from me..
You said, you'II send back his dead body.
And now you say, ''What money?''.
So, it was you who gave
me the money.
Come on, Arjun. It's the money.
Be quick. - Be fast.
Come on, fast.
- Daddy your wife.
Wait. You Iousy woman!
You idiot, the money is mine..- Stop!
I won't give the money.

Give me my money.
- Catch him!
Give me my money.
- Catch him!
Wait. - Stop. - My money..
- Your mother, father..
poIice.
Trying to run away
without giving my money.
First pay for the dead body..
and then, you can go anywhere you want.
I don't care.
Ram, give him as much money as
he wants. Get this over with.
But you wiII keep the dead body.
What wiII I do with it?- I don't know.
You can do anything. You can
do anything with the dead body.
SeII it to someone eIse,I don't care.
- Do anything you want.
What is it?
- He's the one.
He's the rascaI who I gave
the money to. - Me?
Yes. The other day, you were
drenched in chicken curry.
So, that was you who
gave me the money.
And you said,
I'II get you the dead body.
He says he gave me the money.
There's a witch, she says
she gave me the money.
And, another fooI says
he gave me the money.
Am I a dancing girI,
that everyone's giving me money?
Who says you gave me the money?
Which stupid fooI gave me the money? TeII me.
Mmu. What are you doing here?
You two know each other.
He's Mamu.
- He's my man.
You said, your man didn't get
the money. - Yes, he didn't.
Open the door.
Listen carefuIIy.
You sent your man to get the money
for the dead body.-Yes.
He's my man.
You heard that he gave him money.
Then, why did you say that
you didn't get the money?
But, I didn't get the money.
- You didn't give the money to Mamu?
You had to give Mamu the
money for the dead body
Mamu said, I'II coIIect the money..
..and, I'II deIiver the dead body.
Just a minute.
Did you say that?
Then, why are you asking us
for the money?
I've brought the dead body.
Where did you get the deadbody from?
I didn't kiII him yet.
Where did you get the dead body from?
No, this is not that dead body.
So, is this your father's dead body?
- Your father's dead?
My father's aIive, he's going to

That's too much.

Ram, here..

Witch, you won't ever Ieave me.
Kidnapper.

And, why did you take money from
three peopIe for the same dead body?
Do you know your target?
I know the target, but the party

Now, who shouId I knock out coId?
TeII me.

We've Iost aII the money.
What can we do when
fate is against us.
What wiII we do now?
Think that we were asIeep and dreaming

They were such wonderfuI dreams.
EIders are right.
We'II get what we're destined for.
Hey Mishra, why are you upset?
We stiII have our rotten Iife.
Rather than spending
a rotten Iife together..

our own Iives.
Goodbye girIs.
We'II meet again
if we're destined too.
Bye-bye.
Money.
Wait there.
