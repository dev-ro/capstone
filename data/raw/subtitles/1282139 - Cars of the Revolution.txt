Mr. Necip?
Hello.
Welcome. I'm Murat.
Come on in, please.
Thank you.
We were delighted to receive
your letter.
- Thanks for your assistance.
- It's nothing sir.
I wish we could be
more helpful.
Thank you.
When was the last time
you came?
41 years ago.
I began to work here
after I graduated.
Has it changed a lot?
Some things, yes.
Some, no.
Mr. Necip?
Is something wrong?
Mr. Necip?
Revolution
MILITARY SEIZES POWER
REVOLUTION
THE CABINET UNDER ARREST
HISTORIC TRIAL BEGINS
Dear citizens, Turkish armed land,
air and naval forces...
...have seized control of
the government...
...as of last midnight.
The action has succeeded
without any bloodshed due to...
...our armed forces'
exemplary cooperation.
ECONOMIC REFORMS NEEDED
COUNTRY IN DEBT
People often say that Turkey is
an agricultural state. That is true.
We can barely buy a couple of buses
by selling a shipful of cotton.
It is impossible to advance just
by selling plants and fruits.
We need an industry.
The general told us to come,
so we have.
In today's conditions it's not possible
for our country to manufacture an automobile.
Gentlemen, automobile means
national industry.
And national industry means
economic freedom.
We should pay our debts first.
The budget is evident. Where are
they going to get the money for it?
If we embark on an adventure
with the people's money...
...we'll be held responsible.
Such an enterprise would scare
away foreign investors too.
We all want what's best for
this country, but...
"Everyone says it's impossible;
they say we'll lose 1 billion liras. "
Some say Turkey can't produce
its own automobile.
That is dark age mentality talking.
I know that the Turkish nation is strong and
talented enough to create its own industry.
This country will build its own automobile.
I salute you all.
This is ridiculous.
Some engineers in the conference
disagree with you, Mr. Rüþtü.
There's no machinery, no workers,
no sub or superstructure. There's nothing.
How can it be possible without
a supply industry?
The supply industry will be built
by the automobile industry, sir.
The employment, financial savings,
technical expertise...
...this industry would create
mean nothing to you?
Yes, but the figures are
indisputable Mr. Ýsmet.
Importing is cheaper than manufacturing
either in the short or long term.
These are issues that require
serious analysis.
The government doesn't have
any money to throw away.
What if they decide not to
sell us spare parts...
...when we need them?
What will you do then?
Let's make a needle first, then
we'll talk about an automobile.
I'm talking about economic
freedom sir.
I say it is impossible Mr. Ýsmet.
Hello Mr. Ýsmet.
Mr. Gündüz. How are you?
Thank you. I listened to your
enthusiastic talk...
...on the domestic automobile
with pleasure.
Thank you. But I couldn't
convince many of the listeners.
Machinery, labor, raw materials,
supply industry...
They listed many shortages.
Yes. But we can overcome all these.
Hard is one thing...
...impossible is another. You know
this better than anyone else.
You think it is possible.
Of course. There are others who agree
but they are too intimidated to speak out.
Why is that?
Take a look around Mr. Gündüz.
We're supposed to be at an
automobile conference...
...but the only thing on the
bureaucrats' agenda is...
...to convince everyone that
it's impossible.
Come Ender. Come. What will
you write for tomorrow?
Do you have a wish, sir?
Not at all. How about, "Cemal Aga
envisions a domestic automobile?"
Everyone I've talked to at the congress...
...says it's just a dream, sir.
Is your vision such a dream?
"Don't get mad at me sir.
Even the industry minister says...
...it's impossible in today's
conditions. "
I guess we have to make the real
revolution in people's minds first.
I'll get straight to the point.
General Cemal wants a domestic
automobile to be built.
Does the general actually want it
built or just a feasibility study?
He was annoyed with
everyone saying...
...Turks cannot build an automobile.
He wants to prove to everyone
that it can be done.
If the attempt is a success,
he will invest in mass production.
Who will lead the project, sir?
They sent the order to us
as Transportation Ministry.
Nd we think that the most
qualified staff...
...is in the State Railways.
I believe we can do it, sir.
How? With what?
Come on Mr. Ýsmet.
Even this meeting is being held
because of your unfounded optimism.
When will we begin if not today?
What is the deadline, sir?
October 29.
Impossible.
It's only four months, sir.
Even Americans need a year
for a new car.
Why do you oppose right away, sir?
Because we are realistic.
Because we are aware of our
economic situation.
We are not delusional like you.
Please, don't be such cowards.
He was annoyed with everyone saying...
I said "yes, we can".
We, as the State Railways...
...can build an automobile
by 29 October.
Mr. Gündüz, didn't you hear.
You only have four months.
If you as the Transportation
Ministry provide...
...the employees and support,
we can do it.
General Cemal and the National
Unity Committee...
...want the project kept
confidential right now.
They don't want to lose face in any case.
Understood.
Mr. Ýsmet, with this budget we
have to solve everything ourselves.
Our railway repair shop in Eskiþehir
is the perfect place for the project.
Please inform Mr. Uður and...
...make a list of people you trust.
Everyone should be in Eskiþehir
on June 20th.
Those who own a car, should come by car.
I am returning to Eskiþehir tonight.
Mr. Erhan, I'll be able to send you
a list of temporary personnel by tomorrow.
Why don't you just accept it Mr. Gündüz?
Under these conditions you cannot do it.
What if we can, Mr. Erhan?
Good day. Is Mr. Uður here?
He's there, beneath the car.
Thank you.
I've just personally checked it Halil.
The problem is with the trip valve.
Disassemble the filters, clean them
well, and then connect them again.
Ok? Here you go.
Ugur.
Ismet! Welcome.
Thanks. How are you?
I'm fine. What are you doing here?
We have to talk.
What about?
Ýsmet Bey, what on earth brought you here?
I came to see if you guys were slacking.
We are, indeed.
Go show your sketches to Yasemin.
So, Ýsmet?
Let's wait for Hayati.
This concerns him too.
Hayati, come here.
Ladies can do the rest.
Listen to me. Zeynep's sister is
perfect for you Hayati.
You should really think about it.
She is a very nice girl, Hayati.
We like her very much. You should meet her.
Come on Hayati.
Your husband is calling.
Uncle Hayati, what is this?
This is a projection device, Yasemin.
Your uncle Uður brought this from
America just to show off.
Right, Uður?
Come, have a seat. The man is
about to reveal something important.
What have you been talking about
constantly since you returned from America?
I don't know? What?
Automobile.
Hopefully, we will build
Turkey's first automobile.
What are you saying?
What is he saying?
A team is being formed under Mr. Gündüz's
leadership. We will be part of that team.
Can we really do it?
At least, we'll have a chance to try.
Aren't you railway engineers?
How will you build a car?
You accepted it, didn't you?
We begin in two days.
Only you would accept such a project.
Please take care of your health
this time. You used to smoke less.
I will be very busy for the next few months.
You should go on holiday
without me this year.
Impossible. If I'm not here,
you won't look after yourself.
Please. No objections.
Eat your meal.
Come in.
May I, sir?
Come in Sami.
Duty posting lists.
Any news from Yassýada?
No, sir. They're still on the
expropriation case.
I understand.
With your permission.
What of the automobile issue?
Transportation Ministry reported that...
...the team will arrive in Eskiþehir today.
Good, good. Sami, I'm entrusting
that project to you.
Don't worry, sir.
I will follow it personally.
Necip! Necip! Necip!
I have been calling for you.
I was thinking, sorry.
I'm so fat, Necip. I can't fit
into any of my clothes anymore.
You are beautiful, don't worry.
Would you like a cup of tea?
No, I'm late. I have to leave now.
I haven't seen you for days.
Please stay another five minutes.
I can't, Nilüfer.
The engineers will arrive today.
I have to welcome them.
Mr. Gündüz came in yesterday
and asked me personally.
We haven't had them over
for dinner for a long time.
Cook artichoke. Mr. Gündüz loves it.
Ok. I'll talk to Suna.
Nilüfer, this time please cook the
artichoke yourself, don't ask Ms. Suna.
Shame on you!
Wait.
Do you need anything for tonight?
We will go shopping with Suna today.
Ok. Go. How do I look?
You look handsome.
Don't lie.
I swear.
Do I look like an engineer?
Yes, you do.
Come on.
Good bye.
See you.
Good morning Suna. Off to school?
Good morning. Last day.
I will give out report cards.
I bet the kids are so excited now.
Very! We'll go shopping after
I return from school in the afternoon.
Okay.
See you later.
Bye.
Welcome.
- Thanks.
- Necip.
- Welcome everyone.
- Hello, I'm Aziz.
Necip. Bonjour.
Necip. We'll make formal introductions
inside in a minute.
Welcome. Necip.
Hello.
Hello.
Necip.
Welcome.
Welcome sir.
Merci.
Necip.
Ismet.
Shall we get the bags or leave
them in the bus?
I will arrange that.
Take all the bags to the guesthouse.
Welcome.
Welcome.
When did you arrive?
It's been a while.
You couldn't even pass a bus.
The guy is so anxious that
he doesn't speed over 25 MHP.
How are you, Uður?
Have the others come?
Let me check.
Come on.
Thanks.
Young man!
Yes?
What yes? Come here and take the bag.
I've been waiting at the station
for hours. No one came!
I'm Engineer Latif Tebriz.
Welcome, sir. And I am
Engineer Necip Kavaklý.
Are you an engineer?
Yes sir. I'm 24.
Good, then this won't be too
heavy for you. There you go.
Is everyone here?
Sorry for keeping you under the sun.
Welcome Mr. Latif.
Thank you Mr. Gündüz.
Come on in.
Firstly, welcome.
Thank you.
I've worked with some of you before.
And I know the names of most
of you from...
...your commendable work to
the State Railways
First, thank you for accepting
my invitation.
We thank you.
Mr. Gündüz, now we all came
here, but...
...we still don't know what
the project is.
We are going to build the country's
first automobile.
Automobile? Us?
How much time do we have?
We have to finish the automobile
for the Republic Day Celebrations.
Which means 130 days.
Impossible.
This means no time.
Mr. Gündüz, many of us don't
even know how...
...to drive a car,
let alone build one.
I think you are being too modest.
You all are this country's
best engineers.
But, it's not only up to us.
Please, I'm aware of the difficulties
and the shortages.
But, all these years haven't we all
been waiting for such an opportunity?
Don't we always say that if we get
a chance we can do what they can.
Here is our chance.
Think what could happen...
...what would change if we do this.
This is a matter of believing.
If there is anyone who doesn't believe
we can do it...
...he may leave the project.
No hard feelings.
But, as a Turkish engineer, I want
to build a Turkish automobile.
Plus, we also have one big advantage:
No one believes we can.
Headlines! Read the headlines!
News from the constitution
breach case.
Read about the accused former
Prime Minister Adnan Menderes!
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
Good bye.
After the butcher, I'm done.
I have to buy wool from there.
Good day Ms. Teacher.
- Greetings. Do you have plain white cloth?
- No.
Thanks. Good day. You know you will
need that for the baby, right?
My mom is handling all that.
It'll be soon, right?
Have you thought of a name?
If it's a girl, Sevgi. If a boy...
...I want to name him Kemal, but for
two days Necip has been saying Gündüz.
He's been so excited ever since
he's been assigned to the project.
If my belly wasn't this huge
he wouldn't even notice me.
Get used to it Nilüfer. You won't see much
of your husband till the end of the project.
Whatever. We don't do anything
these days anyhow.
Have you seen that Suna? I'd die
if I don't ask the price, wait a minute.
Hello. How much is this baby dress?
20 liras.
20 liras? Ok, thanks.
He says 20 liras for that tiny dress.
I can buy wool and knit it myself.
Let's go Suna.
The hardest parts are the engine
and transmission.
We have to make everything,
every tiny part from scratch.
Engine block, eccentric shaft, pistons,
crankshaft, bearings, gearwheels.
The calculations must be flawless.
How are we going to do all these
in 130 days?
In fact, we don't even have 130 days
for the engine and transmission.
We have to allocate time
for assembling...
...the engine compatibility
tests, test drives...
...and the corrections.
This means for the engine and
transmission we have only 95 days.
What if we take some parts from
other cars? Who would know?
We would, Mr. Ahmet!
Isn't that enough?
Of course we will purchase
some parts.
But this automobile and engine
should be Turkish.
This is essential.
In that case, the engine we build
should be four cylinders.
We would save fuel and fit it
into the body easier.
And we need a very special
cooling system.
The air filter should be resistant
to heavy dust.
Our roads are dirt roads and bumpy.
The airbed of the tires should be high.
The interior should be spacious.
Should the engine be a OHV or OHC?
OHC is harder to build but it's
more efficient in the long run.
On the other hand, OHV is easier
to build.
Let's build both. We can build one
here and the other in the Ankara factory.
This way we'll try both systems
and we'll have a spare engine.
There's still the matter of
electricity...
...breaks, the body, the panel,
the windows.
We're accustomed to trains,
but a car is a different story.
There's much to be done.
See!
It happens every now and then.
It'll come back in a minute.
And there is also the issue of
a generator.
How many of you came by car?
So, there's only one.
Shall we watch the film before
we lose electricity again?
I think it might give us a general
view about production.
Go ahead Mr. Uður.
Can you please give him a hand,
Mr. Necip?
Thank you Mr. Uður.
We'll determine the work groups
tomorrow. Let's call it a day.
129 DAYS REMAIN
Why did you show that film, Uður?
Everyone's already worried if we'll be able
to do it. The film made everyone upset.
I didn't mean to upset them.
I just wanted to show them the
future of the country if we succeed.
Come in. Come in.
Come in, Hayati.
Haven't you gone to bed yet?
No, we haven't.
We were talking.
You're turning in, I guess.
I'm a bit tired from the driving.
Uður, I'll stop by the directorate
tomorrow morning.
Would you look after my car?
Ok.
Sleep well.
Thanks. You, too.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.
If you are done with the hood,
I'll take the electrical wiring.
Good morning.
Only the windshield is left.
Hold the windshield.
Mr. Hayati, I know it's a bit
hasty, but...
...believe me, it has already
helped us a great deal.
Don't worry, your automobile
is under my guarantee.
As long as it helps.
128 DAYS REMAIN
Wait a minute. 16-35...
No, write these down. Write them.
Turkish families have three-four kids.
We need more space.
I need this! What are you doing there?
What if we put the grid all the way
between the lights... To cool the engine.
The roads become so dark at night,
don't they?
Mr. Adnan, shall we make the rear
higher and angled...
...so that it becomes more spacious?
What are we going to name it?
Revolution. General Cemal wants it so.
This one's for you.
Thanks.
Ender. How was Ankara?
Is there any news?
No, the same. Yassýada, the economy,
new constitution.
General Cemal?
He's the same, too.
Now he wants to start an
automobile industry.
Where did he come up with that?
Who knows?
"He recently grilled everyone
who said...
..."Turks can't build a car".
The same old General Cemal.
Automobile is a Pink Dream.
How's it going?
Piston rods arrived from the foundry.
But they are not good.
None?
Because of the moulding.
It needs to be more precise.
We have to fix it.
The boys are trying, but they
haven't managed yet.
What else can we do?
Have you talked to Master Recep?
Who's he?
Master Recep! Master Recep!
There he is.
Hello, Master Recep.
Hello, Master Recep.
How are you Mr. Engineer?
Thank you Master Recep, we are
fine but we have a problem.
I said only you could solve this.
Master Recep, all the piston rods
we have moulded are faulty.
They break easily.
Can you take a look?
How did you pour these?
Into sand moulds, with two percent chrome.
Vertical or horizontal?
Horizontal.
You have to increase the chrome by one
percent and pour it into a vertical die.
How can he know without any calculations?
You asked, I answered.
Do whatever you want mister.
Can you make these rods for us
Master Recep?
I need one day to make the die.
Good.
Master Recep will work for me
from now on.
But Sir, Master Recep is a little...
I don't know how to put it.
Aggressive. His record is also bad.
Good. He's one of us then.
According to a new resolution
passed today...
...elections for the National
Assembly...
...and the republican senate
will be held on 15 October 1961.
The results will determine 450 parliament
members and 150 republic senators.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Aren't you going to finish
your breakfast?
I'm late, I have to go.
Eat some more, dear.
See you tonight, honey.
Gündüz, dear. Is something wrong?
One of the issues occupying people's
mind for the past few months...
...is whether Turkey can build
its own car or not.
They'll build it my ass.
We all love our country
but sometimes...
...we examine things with our pride
when we shouldn't.
I am asking for the sake of
saving our resources:
...how will a country with such
limited economic sources;...
...without an industry; when it
can't even manufacture...
...a needle, build a high-tech
thing like an automobile?
What is this if not a pink dream?
Come on, Uður.
Cheers to that article.
Why is that?
Because it's right.
Would it be bad if Turkish automobiles
were on our streets?
Look gentlemen, this is imported.
And this one's Turkish.
Get it? We couldn't do it even
if we wanted to.
How do you know without even trying?
"We are tired of bullshit. We can do this,
we can do that. What's the result? Nothing.
They waste our money.
Who suffers? We do.
Ýsmet.
You said this guy was the best.
Add some more calcium silica. Then
we'll pour it at 10 degrees higher.
Ok master.
Shall we enlarge the thickness?
Not necessary. This will be enough.
Hope so.
Well done Master Recep.
Can you do eight more of these, Recep?
Sure, Mr. Engineer.
Good job.
Thanks.
Mr. Gündüz, a committee
from Ankara has arrived.
They are at the entrance,
asking for you.
They are at the entrance,
asking for you.
Thanks Ahmet.
Welcome. They didn't inform us
you were coming.
We had other business in Eskiþehir.
Mr. Sami asked us to stop by
since we were already here.
Mr. Burt from the US Foreign
Aid Commission.
Hello.
You already know Mr. Clein.
- Certainly.
- Hello.
They also are curious about
your progress.
How's the project progressing
Mr. Gündüz?
Everything is moving according
to plan, Mr. Rüþtü.
Will you be able to finish it?
We are trying our best.
I hope so. General Cemal has
great expectations, Mr. Gündüz.
As project chief I'm well aware
of this fact, Mr. Rüþtü.
Let's not take any more of
Mr. Gündüz's time.
Excuse us Mr. Gündüz.
Good bye Mr. Rüþtü. Have a nice day.
Suna.
Suna. Honey.
You're home.
Go to bed, don't sleep here.
What time is it?
Pretty late.
You must be hungry, I'll make
you something to eat.
Don't bother. I'm exhausted.
I'll heat up something
while you change.
I went to school today.
It turns out that I had 20 lira
overtime pay, so I collected it.
May God bless our government.
Oh, Gündüz. Mr. Bekir sends
his regards.
Gündüz? It's ready.
Gündüz?
Honey.
Gündüz.
Gündüz.
The model has to be ready
by next week.
We'll get it done Mr. Gündüz.
Where are we at?
- I'm almost done with the material
inventory. - Good.
Are they all good?
Yes.
See Mr. Gündüz, this is the original
one and this is the one we molded.
- This is the one we made, right?
- Yes.
Very nice. Perfect.
It'll be even better once it's processed.
Did the oxygen arrive?
Yes. It arrived this morning.
You can exchange tanks if you'd like.
I'll do that.
I'm removing this
from the to-do list.
Hello?
I'm transferring you to
Mr. Sami from Ankara.
Ok. Hello Mr. Sami.
What's your progress?
It's going well. Thank you.
Mr. Gündüz, there were strong objections
in Ankara to the project's budget.
Sadly, we had to cut your fund
down to 900 thousand liras.
This means a one third cut Mr. Sami.
I know but in these difficult times
your budget has created antagonism.
Especially, after that article
in the newspaper.
You are well aware of our difficulties
and shortages here.
You should have predicted these.
You accepted the project although
you were informed about the difficulties.
The power goes off everyday Mr. Sami.
We need a generator.
Mr. Gündüz, enough money has
already been spent...
...but there are no results yet.
There will be, Mr. Sami.
We've just started.
When there is, we'll talk again.
Have a nice day.
I brought the latest budget figures.
75 DAYS REMAIN
We have to forge the plates manually.
It'll take too long.
We don't have time.
Can't we find a press?
We need large plate presses for the body.
There are none in Turkey.
We don't have time to produce the press
moulds, either. It's difficult.
We have to give it a rough shape at least,
so that you can finish it manually.
How are we going to do that?
That's why we need a large
plate press.
How much weight can
the hydraulic jacks lift?
Two tones.
I think there's a way.
I have a bad feeling about this.
What else is new? Go Mehmet.
It's going to break Mr. Hayati.
It won't.
A little more.
You're forcing it. It will break.
I said, it won't. Go on.
A little more.
That's it!
It cost even less than we thought.
Send the photograph to Ankara
right away.
There's nothing to worry about.
They only managed a few parts
in two months.
They won't be able to finish it.
What if they do, Mr. Sami?
What if they actually build it?
What will happen then? What if they ask
for money to build a plane...
...or a ship in the future?
What will we do then?
Excuse me, but I don't
understand why...
...it's so bad for them
to finish the car.
Let's say they did,
and that piece of junk car worked.
Then General Cemal ordered a factory
to be built immediately. Don't you...
...know how many plants were
opened and closed like this?
This nation has no longer
any money to waste.
You might have it,
but we don't.
Come in.
Let's look after investment
we can finalize.
How many times do
I have to say it?
Check if the cable is plugged
to the battery.
I don't want to get electrocuted
at this age.
I'm checking Mr. Latif.
Please don't get mad.
May I ask something Mr. Latif?
Go ahead.
What do you think will happen
if we build this car?
Nothing.
What do you mean?
Are we working for nothing?
Have you heard about the plane factory
in Ankara that was closed down?
In Ankara. Yes.
Do you know
why it was shut down?
No.
That factory was built
by Atatürk's orders.
112 different planes were built there
until World War II.
Then the factory began
to grow of course.
During the war,
no one gave us planes...
...so 185 training planes
were built there.
185!
Yes, we did that.
In 1955, the Dutch gave us
an order for 30 planes...
...but the Minister of the time
refused the order.
Then the Dutch bought
the planes from England.
Later, they shut the factory down for good
and converted it into a tractor factory.
Gündüz and I were trained there.
We suffered terribly.
I don't understand.
Why did they shut it down?
Who are we to build planes,
they said.
But you built them.
You succeeded.
In Turkey, no success goes
unpunished, son.
How do you know it will be
the same this time?
We'll see.
Why did you accept the project
if you're so sure?
For Gündüz.
Is that all?
That's all.
Let's go. Plug it in.
I thought you said
you checked it.
What you know is just as much as
what I forgot, son.
You're home?
Did I wake you up?
No. I was half-asleep.
I have a terrible taste in my mouth.
Do you feel sick?
No.
Necip...
Nilüfer...
Necip...
Nilüfer...
I was eating an apple in my dream.
Necip.
I'm craving for an apple.
Stop! Stop!
Come here.
Good night.
What are you doing?
I was checking if the greengrocer
was sleeping inside.
Don't you know there's a curfew?
Yes, I know. But my wife is pregnant.
She's craving for apples.
Go back home or I'll have to arrest
and take you to the police station.
Understood.
Come on. Come on.
Necip, is that you?
Mr. Gündüz?
What are you doing on top of a tree
in the middle of the night?
Mr. Gündüz...
Nilüfer craved for apples.
The grocery was closed and I couldn't
think of any other place.
This tree is government property.
Get down.
I'm sorry.
I didn't think of it.
Those are more ripe.
Pick them.
Easy. Take it easy son.
Don't fall down.
I'm embarrassed that you had to
see me like this Mr. Gündüz.
The apple is delicious.
How's Nilüfer?
She's fine.
She's craving.
She is. I don't see her much
these days. How's Ms. Suna?
I don't see her much either.
Yeah. Because of this martial law business
I almost got arrested because of an apple.
Don't worry.
They should be gone by now.
Then let's widen the water jackets
in the block. What do you think?
It might work. We can even increase
the number of ducts.
Thanks.
Are you working on that automobile
in the railway repair shop?
My neighbor is a headworker there.
That's how I know.
Keep up the good work.
The tea is on me.
Thank you.
So, what do you think?
This is much harder molding.
We'll need more cores.
How can we do it?
We need to cast a new block.
At the latest Yassýada hearing,
Chief Justice Baþol...
...said the constitution and
the other 17 cases...
...are officially finalized and
the decree will be announced...
...on 15 September 1961...
We can do it,
but I have to go to Sivas.
They are more experienced than
us in this kind of core molding.
How long would it take?
We can mould it at the factory
in Sivas in two days...
...and process it in a day
in Ankara.
If all goes well,
I'll be back in five days.
Good.
It gives us time.
Mr. Engineer, is it possible for you
to draw a more detailed model?
Right away.
70. 5...
Very nice. Just as we calculated.
Good job, Master Recep.
Have you examined the State Planning
Organization report in detail?
It's in agreement with the general
consensus Sir.
You mean that the automobiles
aren't profitable and...
...the production can't get
beyond a prototype.
Is this the general belief?
I see.
For the investment to be economic...
...we need to manufacture and
sell 20,000 cars.
It's stated in the report too. Turkey will not
have that kind of demand for automobiles.
General. If we try to build
and sell cars...
...the Europeans won't buy
hazelnuts from us.
The whole sector will collapse
for the sake of a few cars.
Automobile industry means millions
of dollars of expense.
A bad investment would put us...
...in a precarious position
in the eyes of the people.
When the people see that car
run on October 29th...
...they will embrace it more than
you or me. You'll see.
Thanks. Hello?
Ugur?
Mine? How are you?
We're fine. You?
Why are you out of breath?
I had to run downstairs. It's been hours
since I've registered your number.
We gave up hope
and were going to bed.
They just connected a minute ago.
How are you Uður?
We're fine, working.
Did Zehra come?
Yes.
Good. Ýsmet is with me. He wants
to talk to her. How's the boy?
Serdar, come say hello
to your dad. Hurry!
Daddy, when are you
going to come?
Son. Soon.
So soon. How are you?
I'm fine.
Talk son. How's work?
Are you working long hours Uður?
A little.
Don't you worry.
- Mine...
- Yes.
I'll put Ýsmet on.
He'll talk to Zehra.
Ok. Uður. Tell Hayati that Zeynep's
sister sends him her regards.
I will.
Come on.
Hello.
Hello, how are you Zehra?
I'm fine,
how are you?
Hello?
Mr. Gündüz? This is Erhan.
How are you?
Thank you. We're working; we're
about to run our first engine test.
Wonderful. General Cemal and
some committee members will visit you...
...on Wednesday.
This Wednesday?
Mr. Erhan, how are we supposed to get
ready for such a visit in three days?
You're right Mr. Gündüz.
But General Cemal planned the visit
himself. He's eager to see some progress.
Journalist Ender Alkýn will be
among the visitors.
I see.
Just to let you know.
Thank you Mr. Erhan.
You're welcome.
Have a nice day.
You too.
Are we ready?
Let's give it a try.
Turn it off!
No, no.
It might be the crankshaft.
Turn it off!
- Shall we?
- Not yet.
It's overheating.
I told you to turn it off.
We've forced it too much.
What were we supposed to do?
Just run it...
...for five seconds and then
stop it to fool ourselves?
Is there a problem with
the valve tunings?
If there was, we could tell
from the sound.
Is it the bearing tolerances?
No, we've checked them.
Oil cavity calculations?
We've checked them, too.
All the calculations are right.
- Why didn't it work then?
- Could it be something with the oil pump?
God, why didn't it work?
We just couldn't do it.
There is a problem.
If you know so much,
you figure it out!
Are you done?
If you are, let's try to solve
the problem together.
We still have 72 hours before
General Cemal arrives.
- We will be disgraced.
- No, we won't!
We've come this far and
we'll take care of the rest.
Look, this is no longer just a
matter of building an automobile.
It's much more important,
much more bigger than that.
I'm sick and tired of hearing
for weeks people saying...
..."they won't be able to do it".
This is a matter of honor for us now.
Don't forget that.
Shall we recheck the compression
torques?
Yes, it might be a casting problem.
Let's disassemble it and see.
Let's go.
Mehmet, Fatih, come here.
55 DAYS REMAIN
52 DAYS REMAIN
- Are you alright?
- I am.
I just came to change.
Can you iron my white shirt
while I shave?
Of course, I can.
Would you like tea?
No, thanks. I have to go right
back to the office.
You'll leave immediately?
I have lots of work to do.
Gündüz.
You haven't been home for days.
- It's obvious you haven't slept at all
- Suna. Not now.
Then when, Gündüz?
You look worn out.
At least sleep a little...
Suna! Stop it!
How can I sleep when everyone
else is working like slaves.
For God's sake.
For the first time, I'm afraid.
General Cemal will visit the workshop in
two hours, to see the engine we've built.
Everyone's efforts, everything
is at the tip of an ignition.
Maybe, I shouldn't have gotten
myself into this.
I was unfair to you too.
And I dragged all those people
into this with me.
I know you; you don't force
anyone into anything.
It's obvious they wanted
to work with you...
...and they also believed
in this project.
See, even the head of government is
coming to see what you've accomplished.
You surprised everyone.
Come on. You're almost there.
Surprise them a little more.
Thank you.
- What's our status?
- It's done.
- We're connecting the ignition valves.
- Good.
But, Mr. Gündüz, we should test it.
We have to adjust the idling, too.
Yes.
This will have to do.
Mr. Gündüz, at least...
Mr. Gündüz,
they're approaching the main gate.
Here we go.
Mr. Gündüz.
Welcome sir.
It's an honor to see you.
Thank you.
Our leader can't wait
to see your work.
I'm very curious Mr. Gündüz.
After you sir.
- Welcome sir.
- Hello.
- Welcome sir.
- Hello.
- Welcome sir.
- Hello.
Here we are. This is the engine.
With your permission sir.
Go ahead.
This is the moment of truth.
Relax son.
- Mr. Latif? - Mind your business.
Don't get on my nerves.
Congratulations.
Good job.
Thank you sir.
It's their accomplishment.
Mr. Gündüz, I congratulate you on your
decision to build the engine four-cylinder.
It's all good and fine,
but is this engine economic?
Hold on. That engine that works.
A Turkish engine.
That's what matters right now.
Bravo, Cemal Aga.
Would you like to see the other
sections Sir?
Let's see, let's see.
Congratulations again Mr. Gündüz.
Thank you sir.
I can hardly wait to see
the second car.
The second car, sir?
We informed you two weeks ago
that two cars have to be...
...ready for October the 29th.
- We didn't receive...
- A copy of the order is here.
You couldn't possibly
have thought that...
...we would go in front of
the public with just one car.
Is there a problem
Mr. Gündüz?
No, sir.
Let's go.
Well done guys.
Go and get
a good rest tonight.
We will build one more car
by October 29.
- Necip?
- Don't tell me you want an apple.
Please don't.
Necip!
Nilüfer! Wait, wait!
Suna! Suna!
I'm coming! What is it Necip?
Nilüfer! She's giving birth.
Her water broke.
- Is she giving birth?
- It's alright dear.
You wake the doorman up. Tell him
to go to the workshop and get Gündüz.
Necip. Calm down.
Stupid Suna. Check the girl first.
Take it easy. Okay.
You're so wet. Take deep breaths.
Okay.
I couldn't find a car,
so I asked the soldiers.
- Necip.
- Take deep breaths.
Necip! Calm down! Lift her feet.
Mind your belly honey.
Take deep breaths. Like this.
Come on Necip, get up.
Suna, why don't they say anything?
Don't worry Necip. I'll go check.
Necip.
How did you hear?
We couldn't sleep, we were working.
The doorman came and told us.
Mr. Gündüz?
He's organizing the others.
He'll be here.
I thought your wife wasn't due yet.
She wasn't, Latif Bey. I don't know?
I haven't been with her for weeks.
Don't worry, everything will be fine.
They took her into surgery.
Get a hold of yourself. Come on.
Necip. Mr. Gündüz is here.
What's the situation?
Be patient, son.
Prends patience. C'est bon, allez!
Come on, son. Pull yourself together.
Everything will be fine. Don't worry.
Necip. You have a daughter.
And the mother is doing fine.
The rascal scared us to death.
You are all uncles now!
Can we see?
See what? She just came out of
surgery. Tomorrow.
Guys, now that we have the good news,
let's go back to work. Come on.
You can stay here.
I'll stay here with them.
You go back to work.
Okay.
Are the panel connections done?
Who do you think you're talking
to. Of course they're done.
- Nice.
- We're going.
Prepare the tea!
Don't worry, we'll be right back.
What happened?
The body is heavier than we expected.
We have to increase
the engine power.
Ýsmet, let's increase
the compression ratio.
Yes, we should check
the carburetor nozzles also.
Let's push it in.
It's done.
Put the chains away.
Turkish looks good on it,
Mr. Gündüz.
Very nice.
I was coming to see you.
I've just talked to Mr. Gündüz. They've
finished testing the second engine too.
Would you like me to report it
to General Cemal?
I'll do it.
Have a nice day.
You too.
First, they were not supposed to begin;
then they were not supposed to finish.
We laughed at them,
but look at where we are now.
Do something Mr. Sami.
What would you like me to do
Mr. Rüþtü?
Talk again with General Cemal.
We, also the State Planning Organization
says its not economic.
The guy is not listening to anyone.
The "guy" you're referring to
is the Head of State, Mr. Rüþtü.
And it's only the beginning.
Once he sees the automobiles run,
no one will be able to stop him.
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
Either I'm not making myself clear or
you don't want to understand.
Enough. Do whatever pleases you.
Start an investigation;
fire me; arrest me.
Do whatever you like. Just leave
us alone until October 29th.
I don't care about the rest!
This is our money they're
throwing away.
Is this all they made
with a million bucks?
What a pity.
Can you give me a paper?
A car for a million.
On General Cemal Gürsel's orders,
a Turkish automobile is being built.
The name of the secret project,
which is expected to cost...
...1 million 400 thousand liras,
is called Revolution.
Hundreds of workers have been
assigned to the project at the...
...Eskiþehir Railway Repair Shop. The
progress can be seen in the side picture.
These people have no shame.
Experts state that the future of the
project, which is intended...
...to be completed by October
the 29th, is uncertain.
Production is expected to move
ahead despite the objection...
...of State Planning Organization.
Hello? Mr. Gündüz.
Says he's a journalist.
I'm not here!
Mr. Gündüz is not here.
Wait a minute.
We have a lot of work to do.
Why are they attacking us Latif?
Isn't it Ankara which authorized
the project? And yet...
...it's Ankara, which is driving
Mr. Gündüz crazy.
Necip, Ankara isn't just one man.
There are a hundred heads there.
One says "yes", the other says "no".
Yes, but isn't it General Cemal
who says "yes"?
There you go. Those who can't oppose
him go around and attack us.
PWhy do you think the newspapers
came down on us? Because anyone who...
...can't criticize his revolution
is coming after ours.
But they'll be all ashamed
when we finish the car.
Didn't you learn anything
from what I said?
I don't want to.
Did you check the accounts Hayati?
Our fund is diminishing Mr. Gündüz.
We have to spend more carefully.
Dear listeners, the National Unity
Committee has met on 15 September 1961...
...Friday at 6 PM under the leadership
of General Cemal Gürsel.
The death sentences of overthrown...
...former president Celal Bayar...
...former Prime Minister
Adnan Menderes...
...former foreign minister
Fatin Rüþtü Zorlu...
...and former finance minister
Hasan Polatkan were approved.
But Celal Bayar's sentence was
commuted...
...into life due to his age
being over 65...
Friends, as a nation we're going
through hard times.
I'm aware that today is
an important day.
Some of us might be upset and some
of us might be pleased by this news.
There may be some who'd like
to sit down and talk about it.
Unfortunately,
we don't even have time for this.
The best thing we can do right
now is to finish...
...what we've started and present
these automobiles to our people.
Now please go back to work.
Please inform Mr. Latif.
He's waiting for that part.
Yes Mr. Uður.
Master Hasan, there's still
a hydraulic leak.
The breaks don't work.
Take care of these today, ok?
Okay M. Ugur.
Fatih, Fatih!
Yes, Mr. Uður.
Drop what you're doing and
check the steering rod.
The car is still pulling
to the right. Go on.
- Take it easy! Use this.
- I'm tuning it Mr. Ýsmet.
You're going to pierce the radiator
trying to tune it.
Everyone's getting agitated.
Hello.
Nilüfer?
Leave it Halil. Let's take a break.
You haven't been eating
properly for days. I made you pastry.
Why did you bother?
It's not a bother at all.
Yes, really.
Why did you bother?
How about some dessert
after the pastry?
What a nice surprise.
Hello Mr. Latif.
How are you?
Thank you.
How are you?
Thank you.
Half an hour lunch break.
19 DAYS REMAIN
Thank you very much Mam.
Everything is delicious.
I'm glad you like it.
There will be blood if you don't
keep some for me.
I'll make more Hayati, don't worry.
How's the baby?
She's driving my mom crazy.
She has gas all the time.
When she breaks wind, the whole house.
Nilüfer! We're eating here.
So what, Necip?
Hayati, Hayati, we are here, too.
Hayati's appetite is as big
as Necip talks about.
He can even eat more,
but he's being shy now.
Don't hold back. Come on, eat.
Come on, eat it up.
16 DAYS REMAIN
General Cemal Gürsel has been elected
president for...
...the next seven years
with 434 votes at the parliament.
The whole nation has welcomed
the news with great joy.
No, no. We don't have time to mount and
check everything. There's just no time!
Hayati... Hayati...
1 DAY REMAINS.
- Ugur.
- Yes, Mr. Gündüz.
The Railways
Transportation Office called.
They want the gas tanks emptied
before they load up the automobiles.
It's apparently
a fire safety precaution.
Safety? Why?
They say that sparks from the
locomotive might set the tanks on fire.
Yes but we're transporting
the cars in closed containers.
I know, but they insist that it's
the regulation. We have to comply.
How will we go to the parliament?
Just leave enough gas to take us
to the parliament and the stadium.
Latif. You should get ready.
No, I decided not to come.
Why? What's wrong?
I'd rather stay here.
I'll get nervous there.
I'll listen to the radio with
everyone else.
Take the boy with you,
let him see Ankara.
Necip, go get ready.
You're coming with us
in the evening.
- To Ankara?
- Yes.
Okay. Thank you very much.
Uður, say when.
A bit more.
Say when.
A little more.
Come on, say when.
Okay, Hayati.
Come on, load up the cars.
Listen, behave yourself there.
Master Recep.
Have a good trip.
Thanks.
- It hasn't started yet, right?
- No.
We have tea. Help yourselves.
Recep, what are you doing there?
Je m'occupe en attendant.
Don't worry. It'll all go well.
Hope so.
You'll see, it will be fine.
Come in.
The automobiles are about to
arrive at the parliament, sir.
Thank you.
Where are they Suna?
I'm panicking.
They'll be here soon,
don't worry.
Dear listeners, we are expecting
the arrival of our first...
...domestic automobile, Revolution,
built on the orders of...
...President Cemal Gürsel,
to the parliament soon.
Here they are.
The Revolution cars,
carrying their Eskiþehir plates...
...have arrived at the parliament.
Built by Turkish engineers...
...and Turkish workers, the cars...
...are entering
the parliament courtyard.
Necip.
People are greeting the first Turkish
automobiles with great enthusiasm.
This is a moment of great pride
and joy for us all.
Our engineers who have made
this important event...
...possible are getting out
of their cars.
Come in.
Good morning sir.
Good morning Sami.
I wanted to inform you that
the cars have arrived.
I was just looking at them.
Shall we go?
We still have time, sir.
They are getting ready outside.
Fine. Aren't they beautiful?
Do you see all these people?
Do you see their excitement?
Yes sir.
That's why I wanted these cars.
Do you understand now?
Let me move this a bit forward.
Your wife came as well.
Mr. Gündüz.
The black car is out of gas.
What?
There should be more,
but there's no gas left.
How could that be?
I don't know.
Maybe the indicator is broken.
We've checked it countless times!
What are we going to do now? What?
Take it easy.
Get the beige one ready.
It's ready.
Necip, Hayati,
you go and find some gas.
We have some more time.
Go, go.
Sir, can you please move the black car
to the edge of the red carpet...
...for our President?
Sir, the beige one is the first
Revolution car that was completed.
I'm sure the President will want
to ride that one.
Mister,
state cars are always black.
And our orders are to get
the black one ready.
Look sir.
The President is about to arrive.
Please.
- I see. Okay.
- Yes.
Get the black one ready.
Isn't it time yet?
We still have 10 minutes, sir.
They're moving the cars.
Something's wrong.
Where are they?
Sorry. Sorry.
We couldn't find a funnel. None.
That's it. I can't wait any more.
I'm going downstairs.
Not like that, no!
I beg your pardon, sir.
I will just check an article.
Roll it.
Come on, hurry!
Bring it here! Pour it!
We need something thicker,
this is tearing.
It's tearing!
Take this.
Pour it!
His Excellency is about to arrive.
Pour it Uður, pour it!
That's enough, okay.
He's coming!
Pick it up.
It's an honor sir.
Cemal Aga.
I would like to congratulate
the talented engineers and workers of...
...the State Railways,
who have built these cars.
Those who believed and said...
..."we can't produce an automobile"
should be ashamed right now.
See, this country can build
its own car as well.
- Who will drive us?
- I will, sir.
Fahri, Mesud, Rüþtü, come with us.
The car is spacious.
No. I will sit in front,
next to Mr. Engineer.
The president entered
the car and...
This is a historic moment
for Turkey.
The car is taking the president to the
Republic Day Celebrations at the stadium.
The first Turkish car,
Revolution, is moving.
Mr. Sami,
they've actually built the car.
I never said
they couldn't build it.
I said they couldn't go into
mass production.
What happened?
We ran out of gas, sir.
Revolution has suddenly stopped.
There's silence at
Parliament square.
Get behind the wheel, Ýsmet.
Why did the car stop, sir?
Will this affect the future of
the Revolution project, sir?
We've built a car
like a westerner...
...but forgot to put gas in it
like an easterner.
May I take you to the other car, sir?
But, still, this project constitutes
a proud moment in Turkish history.
Will you meet with the engineers, sir?
Call the newspaper.
"Revolution didn't run". Hurry.
Send a telex to Ýstanbul
immediately.
Tell them to change the headline.
"The Revolution Broke Down". Go!
About the car's breakdown,
the president said...
..."We've built a car like a
westerner, but...
...forgot to put gas in it like
an easterner".
So what?
He can ride in the other car.
It doesn't matter anymore.
Does this one have gas?
Yes sir.
Let's go.
Join the convoy
once you put gas in it.
Yes sir.
Suna.
I'm proud of you.
Thank you.
Good job, guys. Thank you.
- Ýsmet, I see you're packed.
- Yes.
Mr Gündüz, I thought when
Revolution stopped...
...at least the people
would give it a push.
Never give up trying.
They wouldn't allow a car
named "Revolution"...
...to be on the streets anyhow.
Mr. Hayati.
Here you go.
Have you reassembled my car?
I even drove it.
Come, see for yourself.
Come in.
Mr. Gündüz,
we're leaving soon.
Uður, don't leave right away.
I have to pass out your bonuses
and overtime pays.
We talked about that.
We don't want it.
Let the government keep its money.
Okay. I'll return it.
But, if you don't mind we would
like a souvenir photo with you.
Sure. I'll be there in a minute.
I don't know if I'll have a
chance later on.
I will remember these days with
pride for the rest of my life.
Thank you for giving me the opportunity
to be a part of this project.
Thank you.
We're waiting for you outside.
I still don't get it.
After all, the car only stopped for five
minutes because it ran out of gas.
Didn't General Cemal ride in
the other car we built? He did.
Why don't they look at it this way?
Haven't you seen
the newspapers?
It's already been recorded
the other way around.
50 years later from now, when someone
says "Revolution cars"...
...people will say "you mean
those that didn't run. "
No matter what anyone says,
we built these cars.
Nothing can ever change that.
Nothing.
How are you guys?
Everyone is looking very sharp.
Please look this way.
Wait a minute!
MADE IN TURKEY
We're ready.
- Ready, set... go.
- Good job, guys.
R. Necip. Mr. Necip!
This is the only one left.
Just like me.
I wish my friends could see it.
Would you like to get in?
- May I?
- Of course, Mr. Necip.
You are the one who built it.
- Is there gas in the tank?
- Yes.
During the Revolution project,
4 cars and 10 engines were built.
Despite this, the project was cancelled
and three of the cars were scrapped.
The remaining "Revolution"...
...the first Turkish car,
still runs today.
