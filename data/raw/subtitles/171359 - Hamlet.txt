The beautyofthe world...
the paragonofanimals.
Andyet to me...
what is thisquintessence ofdust?
Though yet of HamIet our brother"s
death, our memory be green...
and that it us befitted
to bear our heart in grief...
and our whoIe Kingdom to be
contracted in one brow of woe.
Yet so far hath discretion
fought with nature...
that we think of him together
with remembrance of ourseIves.
Therefore, our sometime sister,
now our Queen.
The imperiaI jointress
to this warIike state.
Have we, as "twere,
with a defeated joy...
with an auspicious
and dropping eye...
with mirth in funeraI
and with dirge in marriage...
in equaI scaIe,
weighing deIight and doIe...
taken to wife.
Nor have we herein barred
your better wisdoms...
which have freeIy gone
with this affair aIong...
...for aII...
-Our thanks.
Now foIIows that you know,
young Fortinbras...
hoIding aweak supposaI
of our worth...
or thinking by our brother"s death
our state to be out of frame...
co-Ieagued with this dream
of his advantage...
he hath not faiIed to pester us
with message importing...
the surrender of those Iands
Iost by his father...
with aII bond of Iaw
to our most vaIiant brother.
So much for him!
And now, Laertes,
what "s the news with you?
The head"s not more native to the
heart, the hand more instrumentaI...
to the mouth than is the throne
of Denmark to thy father!
-What wouIdst thou have, Laertes?
-Your Ieave to return to France.
From whence, though wiIIingIy I come
to show my duty in your coronation...
now I must confess, that duty done,
my thoughts bend again to France.
Have you your father"s Ieave?
What says, PoIonius?
He has, my Lord, wrung from me
my sIow Ieave.
By Iaborsome petition
and, at Iast...
upon his wiII I seaIed
my hard consent.
I do bessech you
give him Ieave to go.
Take thy fair hour, Laertes.
Time be thine and thy best grace...
spend it at thy wiII.
My cousin HamIet, and my son...
how is it that the cIouds
stiII hang on you?
HamIet...
cast thy nighted coIor off,
and Iook Iike a friend on Denmark.
Do not with thy veiIed Iids seek
for thy nobIe father in the dust.
Thou know"st "tis common.
AII that Iives must die,
passing through nature to eternity.
Ay, madam, it is common.
If it be, why seems it
so particuIar with thee?
Seems, madam?
Nay, it is.
I know not seems.
"Tis not aIone my inky cIoak,
good mother.
Nor customary suits
of soIemn bIack...
nor windy suspiration
of forced breath. No.
Nor the fruitfuI river in the eye
that can denote me truIy.
These indeed seem, for they are
actions that a man might pIay.
But I have that within which passes
show these but the suits of woe.
"Tis sweet and commendabIe to give
mourning duties to your father.
That father Iost, Iost is...
and the survivor bound in fiIiaI
obIigation to do obsequious sorrow.
But to persevere in condoIement
is stubborness. "Tis unmanIy grief.
It shows awiII
most incorrect to heaven.
A heart unfortified,
a mind impatient.
Your intent to go back to Wittenberg
is most retrograde to our desire.
And we beseech you to remain here,
in the care and comfort of our eye.
Let not thy mother
Iose her prayers, HamIet.
Stay with us,
go not to Wittenberg.
I shaII in aII my best
obey you, madam.

And what make you

-My good Iord.
-I"m very gIad to see you.
Good evening, sir.
-What make you from Wittenberg?
-Truant disposition, good my Iord.
-What is your affair in EIsinore?
-I came for your father"s funeraI.
Do not mock me, feIIow student.
It was for my mother"s wedding.
-Indeed, it foIIowed hard upon.
-Thrift, thrift, Horatio.
The funeraI baked meats did coIdIy
furnish for the marriage tabIes.
WouId I had met my dearest foe in
heaven or ever I had seen that day!
My father!
Methinks I see my father.
Where, my Iord?
In my mind"s eye.
-I saw him once. A goodIy King.
-He was a man.
Take him for aII and aII,
I shaII not see his Iike again.
I think I saw him...
...yesternight.
-Saw? Who?
My Iord the King, your father.
The King, my father?
Season your admiration for awhiIe
with an attent ear...
whiIe I deIiver upon witness of
this gentIeman this marveI to you.
In the dead waste of the middIe
of the night, the apparition comes.
-Where was this?
-"pon the pIatform, where we watched.
"Tis here.
-But did you not speak to it?
-My Iord, I did...
but answer made it none.
Yet methought it Iifted up its head
and addressed itseIf to motion...
Iike as it wouId speak.
Stay, iIIusion...
if thou hast any sound
or use of voice, speak to me.
It is offended.
If there be any good thing to be
done, that may to thee do ease...
and grace to me, speak to me.
Speak! Speak!
I charge thee speak!
-"Tis very strange.
-As I do Iive, my Iord, "tis true.
And we did think it writ down
in our duty to Iet you know of it.
Indeed, indeed,
but this troubIes me.
-HoId you the watch again tonight?
-I do, my Iord.
-What Iooked he? FrowningIy?
-More in sorrow than in anger.
-And fixed his eyes upon you?
-Most constantIy.
-I wouId I had been there.
-It wouId have much amazed you.
I"II watch tonight. I"II speak to it
though heII shouId hoId my peace.
And I pray you aII, if you have
hitherto conceaIed this sight...
Iet it be tenabIe in your siIence.
Whatever hapth, give it no tongue.
I wiII require your Ioves.
So fare you weII.
Upon the pIatform, "twixt eIeven
and tweIve, I"II visit you.
-Our duty to your honor.
-Your Iove as mine to you. FareweII.
Wouldthe night were come.
Tillthen,slt still,mysoull
Fouldeeds willrise thoughallthe

Perhaps he Ioves you now...
and now no soiI, no cauteI doth
besmirch the virtue of his wiIIs.
But you must fear.
His virtue weighted...
his wiII is not his own, for he
himseIf is subject to his birth.
He may not, as unvaIued persons do,
carve for himseIf.
On his choice depends the heaIth
and safety of this whoIe state.
His choice"s circumscribed unto
that body whereof he"s the head.
If he says he Ioves you, it fits
your wisdom so far to beIieve it...
as he in his particuIar act and
pIace may give his saying deed...
which is no further than the main
voice of Denmark goes withaI.
Then weight what Ioss your honor
may sustain if with too...
credent ear you Iist his songs.
Or Iose your heart.
Or your chaste treasure,
open to his unmastered importunity.
Fear it, OpheIia.
Fear it, my dear sister.
Keep you in the rear of your affection,
out of the danger of desire.
Best safety Iies in fear.
Youth to itseIf rebeIs
though none eIse near.
I shaII the effect of this Iesson
keep, as watchman to my heart.
But good my brother, do not,
as some ungracious pastors do...
show me the steep
and thorny way to heaven...
whiIe Iike a Iibertine himseIf
the path of daIIiance treads...
and recks not his own creed.
Fear me not.
I stay too Iong.
A doubIe bIessing
is a doubIe grace.
Occasion smiIes
upon asecond Ieave.
Yet here, Laertes?
Aboard, aboard for shame.
The wind sits in the shouIder of
your saiI and you are stayed for?
My bIessing with thee!
And these few precepts in thy
memory Iook thou character.
Give thy thoughts no tongue...
nor any unproportionaI
thought his act.
Be thou famiIiar,
but by no means vuIgar.
Those friends thou hast,
and their adoption tried...
grappIe them to thy souI
with hoops of steeI.
But do not duII thy paIm with each
new-hatched, unpIedged comrade.
Beware of entrance to a quarreI...
but being in it, bear"t that
the opposed may beware of thee.
Give every man thy ear,
but few thy voice.
Take each man"s censure,
but reserve thy judgment.
CostIy thy habit
as thy purse can buy...
but not expressed in fancy.
Rich, not gaudy...
for the appareI
oft procIaims the man.
Neither a borrower
nor a Iender be...
for Ioan oft Ioses
both itseIf and friend.
This above aII:
to thine own seIf be true...
and it must foIIow,
as the night the day...
thou canst not then
be faIse to any man.
-I humbIy take my Ieave, my Iord.
-The time invites you. Go!
FareweII, OpheIia.
Remember weII
what I have said to you.
Angelsandministersofgrace,
defendus!
Be thouaspirlt ofhealth
orgoblindamned...
bringwlth thee airsofheaven
orblasts fromhell.
Thoucoms't insuchaquestionable
shape that I'llspeakto thee.
Mark me.
I wiII.
My hour is aImost come...
when I to suIfurous and tormenting
fIames must render up myseIf.
-AIas, poor ghost!
-Pity me not.
But Iend thy serious hearing
to what I shaII unfoId.
Speak.
I am bound to hear.
I am thy father"s spirit...
doomed for a certain term to
waIk the night, and for the day...
confined to fast in fires tiII the crimes
done in my days are purged away.
But that I am forbid to teII
the secrets of my prison house...
I couId a taIe unfoId whose Iightest
word wouId harrow up thy souI...
freeze thy young bIood...
make thy two eyes Iike stars
start from their spheres...
thy knotted Iocks to part and each
particuIar hair stand on end...
Iike quiIIs upon
the fretfuI porcupine.
But this eternaI bIazon must not be
the ears of fIesh and bIood. List!
-If thou did"st thy father Iove...
-Oh, God!
...revenge his most unnaturaI murder.
-Murder?
Murder most fouI, as in the best it is,
but this most fouI, strange...
and unnaturaI.
Now...
HamIet, hear.
"Tis given out that, sIeeping in
my orchard, aserpent stung me.
The ear of Denmark is by a forged
process of my death rankIy abused.
But know the serpent that stung thy
father"s Iife now wears his crown.
-My uncIe!
-Ay!
That incestuous, aduIterate beast,
with witchcraft of his wit...
with traitorous and wicked gifts
that have the power so to seduce...
won to his shamefuI Iust the wiII
of my most seeming-virtuous Queen.
Oh, HamIet, what a faIIing off
was there for me...
whose Iove went hand in hand with
the vow I made to her in marriage.
And to decIine upon awretch whose
gifts were poor to those of mine.
But soft...
methinks I scent the morning air.
Brief Iet me be.
SIeeping within my orchard, my
custom aIways of the afternoon...
on my secure hour, thy uncIe stoIe
with juice of hebona in aviaI...
and in the porches of my ears
did pour the Ieprous distiIIment...
whose effect hoIds such
an enmity with bIood of man...
that as quicksiIver courses through
the naturaI gates of the body...
with vigor it doth poset and curd
Iike eager droppings into miIk...
the thin and whoIesome bIood.
So did it mine.
Thus was I, sIeeping,
by a brother"s hand...
unhouseIed, disappointed, unanneIed.
No reckoning made...
but sent to my account with aII
my imperfections on my head.
Oh, horribIe, horribIe,
most horribIe!
If thou hast nature in thee,
bear it not.
Let not the bed of Denmark be a
couch for Iuxury and damned incest.
But, howsoever thou pursues
this act, taint not thy mind...
nor Iet thy souI contrive
against thy mother.
Leave her to heaven...
and to the thorns that in her bosom
Iodge, to prick and sting her.
Fare thee wiII at once...
remember me!
The time isout ofjoint.
Oh,cursedsplte, that ever
lwasborn to set lt right.
-My Iord...
-What news, my Iord?
Oh, day and night,
but this is wondrous strange!
And therefore as astranger
give him weIcome.
There are more things
in heaven and earth, Horatio...
than are dreamt of
in our phiIosophy.
Myfate criesout.
Hello andwelcome
to Moviephone...
brought to youbyThe New York
Times andAmericanExpress.
lfyouknow the name ofthe movie
you'dlike to see,press 1.
What is it, OpheIia,
that he hath sent you?
So pIease you, something
touching the Iord HamIet.
Merry, weII bethought.
What is between you?
Give me up the truth.
My Iord, he hath of Iate paid many
tenders of his affection to me.
Affection!
Think yourseIf a baby that you have
taken these tenders for true pay...
which are not sterIing.
Tender yourseIf more dearIy.
My Iord, he hath importuned me
with Iove in honorabIe fashion.
When the bIood burns, how prodigaI
the souI doth Iend the tongue vows.
These bIazes, daughter,
getting more Iight than heat...
extinct in both...
even in their promise as it is a
making, you must not take for fire.
I do not know, my Iord,
what I shouId think.
From this time...
be something scanter
of your maiden presence.
Set your entreatments
at a higher rate...
than a command to parIey.
For Lord HamIet, beIieve in him
so much that he is young...
and with a Iarger tether may he
waIk than may be given you.
Do not beIieve his vows!
I wouId not, in pIain terms...
from this time forth...
have you so sIander
any moment Ieisure...
as to give words or taIk
with the Lord HamIet.
Look to it.
I charge you.
We have the word"to be"...
but what lpropose
is the word"to inter-be".
Because lt isnot possible
to be alone, to be byyourself.
Youneedotherpeople
inorderto be.
Youneedotherbeings
inotherto be.
Not onlyyouneedfather,
mother,but also uncle...
brother,sister,society,
but youalso needsunshine...
river,air, trees...
birds,elephants,andso on.
So lt is impossible
to be byyourself,alone.
Youhave to "inter-be"wlth
everyone andeverythingelse.
And, therefore, "to be"
means "to inter-be".
To the celestial,
andmysouI'sidol...
The most beautified,Ophelia...

-How goes my good Iord HamIet?
-WeII, God-a-mercy.
-Do you know me, my Iord?
-Very weII. You"re a fishmonger.
-Not I, my Iord.
-Then I woud you were so honest.
-Honest, my Iord?
-To be picked out of 1O thousand.
That is verytrue,mylord.
Have you a daughter?
-I have, my Iord.
-Let her not waIk in the sun.
Conception is a bIessing, but
as your daughter may conceive...
friend, Iook to it.
Howsayyoubythat?

Andtruly,inmyyouth,

-WiII you go out into the air?
-Into my grave.
My honorabIe Iord, I wiII most
humbIy take my Ieave of you.
You cannot take from me anything
I wiII more wiIIingIy part withaI...
except my Iife.
Except mylife.
Except mylife.
Except mylife.
My Iiege...
my Iiege...
and madam...
to expostuIate
what majesty shouId be...
what duty is, why day is day...
night night and time is time...
wouId nothing but to waste
night, day, and time.
Therefore, since brevity
is the souI of wit...
and tediousness the Iimbs
and outward fIourishes...
I wiII be brief.
Your nobIe son is mad.
""Mad"" caII I it for to define
true madness. What is it but...
to be nothing eIse but mad?
-But Iet that go.
-More matter, Iess art.
Madam, I swear I use no art at aII.
That he is mad "tis true.
"Tis true, "tis pity...
and pity "tis "tis true.
A fooIish figure...
but fareweII it for I use no art.
Mad Iet us grant him then...
now remains for us to find out...
the cause of this effect, or rather
say, the cause of this defect...
for this effect defective
comes by cause.
Thus it remains,
and the remainder thus.
Perpend, I have a daughter...
have whiIe she is mine, who,
in her duty and obedience, mark...
have given me this.
Gather now and surmise.
Came this from HamIet to her?
""I have no art to reckon my groans.
I Iove the best every thought of...
thine ever more whist
this machine is to him...
HamIet.""
This in obedience hast
my daughter shown me...
and more above hath his
soIicitings as they feII out by...
time, by means and pIace.
AII given to mine ear.
How hath she received his Iove?
What do you think of me?
As of a man faithfuI
and honorabIe.
I wouId fain prove so.
But what might you think...
when I had seen this hot Iove
on the wing...
as I perceived it, I must teII you
that, before my daughter toId me...
what might you or
my dear majesty here think...
if I had Iooked upon this Iove
with idIe sight?
What might you think?
No, I went round to work and my
young mistress thus I did bespeak...
""Lord HamIet is a prince
out of thy star.
This must not be.""
She took the fruits of my advice...
and he repeIIed,
ashort taIe to make...
feII into asadness,
then into a fast...
thence to awatch...
thence into aweakness, thence to a
Iightness and by this decIension...
into the madness
wherein now he raves...
and aII we mourn for.
-Do you think "tis this?
-It may be. Very Iike.
Take this from this,
if this be otherwise.
If circumstances Iead me,
I wiII find where truth is hid...
though it were hid indeed
within the center.
To be ornot to be,
that is the question.
Whether'tisnoblerto suffer
the arrowsofoutrageous fortune...
ortake armsagainst aseaof
troublesandbyopposing,endthem.
To die...
to sleep...
no more...
andbyasleepto saywe end
the thousandnaturalshocks...
the fleshisheirto.
'Tisaconsummationdevoutly
to be wished.
To die, to sleep...
achance to dream.
There"s the rub...
for in that sIeep of death
what dreams may come...
when we have shuffIed off this
mortaI coiI must give us pause.
There"s the respect...
that makes caIamity
of so Iong a Iife.
For who wouId bear the whips
and scorns of time...
the proud man"s contumeIy...
the insoIence of office,
the Iaw"s deIay...
the pangs of disprized Iove...
when he himseIf might his own
quietus make with a bare bodkin?
Who wouId fardIes bear to grunt
and sweat under aweary Iife...
were it not the dread
of something after death...
the undiscovered country to
whose bourn no traveIer returns...
and puzzIes the wiII, and makes
us rather bear those iIIs we have...
than fIy to others
we not know of.
And thus conscience does
make cowards of us aII.
And thus the native
hue of resoIution...
is sickIied o"er with
the paIe cast of thought.
And enterprises of great pitch
and moment in this regard...
their currents turn awry...
and Iose the name of action.
My exceIIent good friends!
How dost thou, GuiIdenstern?
Rosencrantz!
Oh, good Iads.
How do you both?
-As the indifferent chiIdren of earth.
-Happy in that we"re not overhappy.
On fortune"s cap,
we are not the very button.
-Nor the soIes of her shoes?
-Neither, my Iord.
What news?
None, my Iord. But that
the worId"s grown honest.
Then doomsday is near.
But your news is not true.
Let me question more in particuIar.
What have you, my good friends,
deserved at the hands of fortune...
that she has sent you
to prison hither?
-Prison, my Iord?
-Denmark is a prison.
-Then the worId is one.
-In which there are many dungeons.
Denmark being one of the worst.
We think not...
We think not so, my Iord!
"Tis none to you. There"s nothing
good or bad. Thinking makes it so.
To me, it is a prison.
Then your ambition makes it so.
"Tis too narrow for your mind.
Oh, God. I couId be
bounded in a nutsheII...
and count myseIf
King of infinite space...
were not that I have bad dreams.
-What make you here?
-Visit you, my Iord!
No other occasion.
Can you by no drift of conference
get why he puts on this confusion...
grating aII his days of quiet with
turbuIent and dangerous Iunacy?
He doesconfess

"Tis most true

to entreat your majesties
to hear and see the matter.
With aII my heart. And it doth

GentIemen, give him a further edge and

-We shall,mylord!
-And for your part, OpheIia...
I wish that your beauties be the
happy cause of HamIet "s wiIdness.
I aIso hope that your virtues wiII
bring him to his wonted way again.
-How does your honor these days?
-I humbIy thank you. WeII.
I have remembrances of yours
I have Ionged Iong to redeIiver.
I pray you, receive them.
No, not I.
-I never gave you aught.
-Lord, you know right weII you did.
And with words of so sweet breath
composed that made them more rich.
Their perfume Iost,
take them again.
For to the nobIe mind rich gifts
wax poor when givers prove unkind.
There, my Iord.
-Are you honest?
-My Iord?
-Are you fair?
-What means your Iordship?
I did Iove you once.
-Indeed, you made me beIieve so.
-You shouId not have beIieved me.
I Ioved you not.
I was the more deceived.
Get thee to a nunnery.
Why wouIdst thou be

I am myseIf indifferent honest

my mother had not borne me.
I am very proud, revengefuI,

Give me a man that "s not passion"s
sIave. I"II wear him in my heart...
ay in my heart of heart,
as I do thee.
Tonight, one scene
comes near the circumstances...
of which I have toId thee of
my father"s death. I prithee...
when thou seest that act afoot,
observe...
my uncIe. If his occuIted guiIt do
not itseIf unkenneI in one speech...
it is a damned ghost
we have seen.
Give him heedfuI note.
Mine eyes"II rivet to his face and
after we"II our judgements join.
WeII, my Iord.
Get you a pIace.
I must be idIe.
HamIet, come sit by me.
Oh, no, mother. Here"s metaI
more attractive.
-Lady, shaII I sit in your Iap?
-No, my Iord.
I mean, my head upon your Iap.
-Ay, my Iord.
-Think you I meant country matters?
I thinking nothing, my Iord.
That "s a fare thought to Iie
between a maid"s Iegs.
-What is, my Iord?
-Nothing.
You are merry, my Iord.
Oh, God. What shouId
a man do but be merry?
Look how cheerfuI my mother Iooks
and my father died within 2 hours.
Nay, "tis twice two months,
my Iord.
So Iong? Let the deviI wear bIack
for I"II have asuit of sabIes.
Oh, heavens! Died 2 months ago
and not forgotten yet.
Then a man"s memory may outIive
his Iife more than haIf ayear.
How fair is our cousin HamIet?
ExceIIent.
-What means this, my Iord?
-It means mischief.
My Iord?
-My Iord?
-Give me some Iight!
-Cry you with faIse fire?
-Away!
My Iord!
Oh, good Horatio...
I"II take the ghost "s word for
a thousand pounds. Didst perceive?
-Very weII, my Iord.
-Upon the poisoning?
I did weII note it.
Some must watch,
while some must sleep.
Thusruns the worldaway.
Good! My Iord.
Hello, this is EarthaKltt.
Catshave nine lives...
but unfortunately
youhave onlyone.
So buckle yourseat belt,
forsafety.
Good my Iord, vouchsafe me
aword with you.
-The King, sir...
-Ay, sir, what of him?
-Is in his retirement, distempered.
-With drink?
Good my Iord, try to put your
discourse into some frame.
I"m tame. Pronounce.
The Queen, your mother, in most
great affIiction of spirit...
has sent me to you.
You"re weIcome.
Nay, good my Iord, this courtesy
is not of the right breed.
-PIease, make awhoIesome answer.
-I cannot.
-What?
-Make you awhoIesome answer.
My wit "s diseased.
Nowis the very

I Iike him not...
nor is it safe to Iet his madness

Most holyandreligious fearlt is...

Neveralone didthe Kingsigh
but wlthageneralgroan.
Arm you, I pray you
to this speedy voyage.
We wiII fetters put about this fear
which now goes too free-footed.
We willhaste us.
My offense is rank.
It smeIIs to heaven...
it has the primaI
eIdest curse upon it.
What if this hand were thicker
than itseIf with brother"s bIood?
Is there not rain enough in the
heavens to wash it white as snow?
Forgive me my fouI murder.
That cannot be. I stiII possess the
effects for which I did the murder.
My crown, mine own ambition...
my Queen.
What then?What rests?
Trywhat repentance can.
What canlt not?
Mywords flyup,
mythoughtsremainbelow.
Words wlthout thoughts
neverto heavengo.
Look you Iay home to him.
TeII him that his pranks
are too broad to bear with...
and that Your Grace...
hath screened and stood
between much heat and him.
Fear me not.
Mother!
I"II shroud me in here.
Pray you, be round with him.
Now, Mother, what "s the matter?
HamIet, thou hast thy father
much offended.
Mother, you have my father
much offended.
-You answer with and idIe tongue!
-You question with awicked tongue!
-Have you forgot me?
-No, not so. You are the Queen...
your husband"s brother"s wife and,
wouId it were not so, my mother!
Then I"II set those to you
that can speak!
Come, come, sit you down!
You shaII not budge, you go not,
tiII I set you up a gIass...
where you may see
the inmost part of you!
What wiIt thou do?
Thou wiIt not murder me? HeIp!
-HeIp!
-HeIp!
What hast thou done?
Nay, I know not.
Is it the King?
Oh, what a rash
and bIoody deed is this?
AImost as bad, good mother...
as kiII a King and marry
with his brother.
-KiII a King?
-Ay, Iady, it was my word.
Thou wretched, rash,
intruding fooI, fareweII.
I took thee for thy better.
Take thy fortune.
Thou find"st to be too busy
in some danger.
Leave wringing of your hands.
Peace! Sit you down...
and Iet me wring your heart,
if it be made of penetrabIe stuff.
-What have I done?
-Have you eyes?
You cannot caII it Iove for at your
age the heyday in the bIood is tame.
It "s humbIe and waits
upon the judgement.
Oh, shame!
Where is thy bIush?
To Iive in the rank sweat
of an enseamed bed!
Honeying and making Iove
over the nasty sty!
-No more!
-God! A kept viIIain, a murderer...
a King of shreds and patches!
No more...
How wouId you, gracious figure?
-Do not come your tardy son to chide.
-AIas, he"s mad.
Do not forget. This visitation is but
to whet thy aImost bIunted purpose.
But Iook.
Amazement on thy mother sits.
Step between her
and her fighting souI!
Speak to her, HamIet!
How is it with you, Iady?
-Where on do you Iook?
-On him! Look how paIe he gIares!
Do not Iook upon me!
To whom do you speak this?
-Do you see nothing there?
-Nothing at aII.
This is the very coinage
of your brain.
My puIse as yours doth keep time
and makes as heaIthfuI music.
It is not madness that
I have uttered. Mother...
for Iove of grace,
confess yourseIf to heaven...
repent what is past,
avoid what is to come...
do not spread the compost on
the weeds to make them ranker.
Oh, HamIet...
thou hast cIeft my heart in twain.
Then throw away the worser part of
it and Iive purer with the other haIf.
Good night.
For the same Iord,
I do repent...
but heaven hath pIeased it so
to punish me with this...
and this with me.
I wiII bestow him and answer weII
the death I gave him.
One word more, good Iady.
-What shaII I do?
-Byno means, that lbidyoudo...
let that bloat King
tempt youagain to bed...
pinch wanton on your cheek,
caII you his mouse...
and for a pair of reechy kisses,
make you raveI aII this matter out.
That I essentiaIIy am not
in madness, but mad in craft.
Be thou assured.
If words are made of breath,
and breath of Iife...
I have no Iife to breathe
what thou hast said to me.
I must to EngIand,
you know that.
AIack, I had forgotten.
'Tisso concludedon.
I"II Iug the guts into
the neighbor room. Mother...
good night.
Indeed, this counseIor
is now most stiII...
most siIent, and most grave.
Who was in Iife a fooIish
prating knave.
Come, sir, to draw toward
an end with you.
Good night, mother.
What have you done, my Iord,
with the dead body?
Compounded it with dust,
whereto "tis kin.
TeII us where "tis that we may take
it thence and bear it to the chapeI.
-Do not beIieve it.
-BeIieve what?
That I can keep your counseI
and not my own.
Besides, to be demanded of
by asponge...
-Take you me for asponge?
-Ay, sir.
One that soaks up the King"s
countenance, awards, authorities.
My Iord, you must teII us where the
body is and go with us to the King.
The body is with the King,
but the King is not with the body.
The King is a thing.
-A thing, my Iord?
-Of nothing.
How now, what hath befaIIen?
Where the dead body
is bestowed, my Iord...
we cannot get from him.
Now, HamIet, where is PoIonius?
At supper.
At supper? Where?
Not where he eats,
but where he"s eaten.
A certain convocation of poIitic
worms are eating at him.
We fat aII creatures eIse to fat us,
we fat ourseIves for maggots.
Your fat King and your Iean beggar
is but variabIe service.
Two dishes, but to one tabIe.
That "s the end.
Where is PoIonius?
In heaven.
Send thither to see.
If your messenger find him not there,
seek him in the other pIace yourseIf.
But indeed, if you find him not
within the month...
you shaII nose him as you go up
the stairs into the Iobby.
-Go seek him there.
-He wiII stay tiII you come.
HamIet, this deed...
For thine speciaI safety,
which we do tender...
as we grieve for that which thou
hast done, must send thee hence...
with fiery quickness.
Therefore prepare thyseIf.
Bark"s ready and the wind"s at heIp.
Thy associates tend and everything...
...is bent for EngIand.
-For EngIand?
-Ay, HamIet.
-Good.
So it is.
If thou knowest our purposes.
FareweII, my mother.
-Thy Ioving father, HamIet.
-My mother.
Father and mother is man and wife,
man and wife is one fIesh...
and so my mother.
For everything is seaIed
and done that Ieans on the affair.
The present death of HamIet.
Do it, EngIand. For Iike
the hectic in my bIood he rages...
and thou must cure me.
Good sir...
whose powers are these?
The nephew to oId Norway,
Fortinbras.

A beast...

He that made us with discourse,

that capabiIity and godIike
reason to fust in us unused.
No. Whether
it "s bestiaI obIivion...
or some craven scrupIe of thinking
too preciseIy on the event...
a thought which, quartered, hath but
1 part wisdom ever 3 parts coward.
I do not know why yet I Iive...
to say: ""this thing"s to do"".
Sith I have the cause,
and means...
and strength and wiII to do it.
ExampIes gross as earth
exhort me.
RightIy to be great...
is not to stir without great argument,
but greatIy to find quarreI...
in astraw when honor
is at the stake.
How stand I then...
that have a father kiIIed...
a mother stained...
excitements of my reason
and my bIood...
and Iet aII sIeep.
From this time forth,

Where is the beauteous majesty
of Denmark?
How now, OpheIia?
How shouId I your true Iove
know from another one?
-AIas, what imports this song?
-What say you?
He is dead and gone, Iady.
Dead and gone!
At his head, a grassgreen turf.
At his heeIs, astone.
-Nay, but, OpheIia...
-Pray you mark!
My Iord, aIas, Iook here.
-How do you do, pretty Iady?
-Let "s have no more words of this.
But when they ask you what
it means, say you this...
Up he rose and donned his cIothes
and dug the chamber door.
Let in the maze and out the maze,
never departed more!
I hope aII wiII be weII.
We must be patient...
but I cannot choose
but to weep...
to think they Iay him
in the coId ground.
My brother wiII know of this!
And so I thank you for
your good counciI. Good night.
Good night, sweet Iadies,
good night! Good night!
How Iong hath she been thus?
CaImIy, good Laertes.
That drop of bIood that "s caIm
procIaims me bastard...
cries cuckoId to my father,
brands the harIot even here...
between the unsmirched brow
of my true mother!
What "s the cause that thy rebeIIion
Iooks so giantIike? Let him go!
Do not fear our person. There"s
such divinity doth hedge a King.
Where is my father?
-Dead.
-But not by him.
How came he dead?
I"II not be juggIed with.
-No, Laertes!
-To heII aIIegiance!
Conscience and grace
to the profoundest pit!
I dare damnation!
Let come what comes, onIy I wiII be
revenged most truIy for my father.
Who shaII stay you?
My wiII, not aII the worId"s.
For my means I shaII husband them
so weII they shaII go fouI with IittIe.
Ay, then, thou speaks Iike
a good chiId and a true gentIeman.
I am guiItIess of your father"s
death and sensibIy in grief for it!
It shaII to your IeveI judgement
peer, as day doth to your eye.
WiII he not come again?
No, no, he"s dead.
Go to thy death bed.
He wiII never come again.
Oh, rose of May, dear maid...
kind sister, sweet OpheIia.
Hadst thou thy wits and persuaded
revenge, it couId not move thus.
How"s it possibIe a maid"s wits shouId
be as mortaI as an oId man"s Iife?
There"s rosemary,
that "s for remembrances.
I pray you, Iove, remember.
And there"s pansies,
that "s for thoughts.
There"s fenneI for you,
and coIumbines.
And there"s rue for you.
And some for me, too.
We may caII it
""herb of grace of Sundays"".
You must wear your rue
with a difference.
There"s a daisy!
I wouId give you vioIets, but they
withered aII when my father died.
They say he came to a good end.
Where the offense is
Iet the great ax faII.
Now must your conscience
my acquitance seaI...
and you must put me
in your heart for friend.
Sith you heard that he which
hath your nobIe father sIain...
pursued my Iife.
TeII me why you proceeded not
against these feats so...
crimefuI and capitaI in nature?
The Queen, his mother,
Iives aImost by his Iooks.
And for myseIf, my virtue
or my pIague, I know not which...
she"s so conjunctive to me that as
astar moves not but in his sphere...
I couId not but by her.
So, I have a nobIe father Iost,
asister...
driven to desperate terms whose
worth, if praises me bring back...
stood chaIIenger on mount
of aII the age for her perfections.
But my revenge wiII come.
Break not your sIeeps for that.
You must not think that we are
made of stuff so fIat and duII...
that we can Iet our beard be shook
with danger and think it pastime.
You shortIy shaII hear more.
I Ioved your father,
and we Iove ourseIf.
And that, I hope,
wiII teach you to imagine...
From HamIet.
Laertes, you shaII hear.
""High and mighty, you shaII know
I am set naked on your Kingdom.
Tomorrow shaII I beg your Ieave
to your KingIy eyes...
where I shaII asking your pardon,
there unto recount the occasion...
of my sudden and more
strange return. HamIet.""
Naked...
And in a postscript he says ""aIone"".
Can you devise me?
I"m Iost in it, my Iord...
but Iet him come.
It warms the very sickness
of my heart.
If he be now returned...
I shaII work him to an expIoit
now ripe in my device...
under the which he shaII
not choose but faII.
And for his death no wind
of bIame shaII breathe.
Not even his mother shaII uncharge
the practice and caII it accident.
Laertes, was your father
dear to you?
Or are you Iike the painting of
asorrow, a face without a heart?
Why ask you this, my Iord?
There Iive within the fIame of Iove
a kind of wick that wiII abate it.
And nothing is as
a Iike goodness stiII.
For goodness, growing to a
pIeurisy, dies in its own too much.
That we wouId do,
we shouId do when we wouId...
for that wouId changes
and hath abatements and deIays...
as many as there are tongues,
or hands or accidents.
And then this ""shouId""
is Iike aspendthrift sigh...
that hurts by easing.
But to the quick of the uIcer.
What wouIdest thou undertake to show
yourseIf your father"s son in deed...
more than in word?
One woe doth tread upon another"s
heeIs, so fast they foIIow.
Your sister is drowned, Laertes.
Drowned?
Drowned.
Drowned.
Not to have strewed thy grave.
And but that great command
o"ersway the order...
she shouId in ground unsanctified
have Iodged tiII the Iast trumpet.
-Must there no more be done?
-No more be done.
Lay her in the earth...
...and from her unpoIIuted fIesh...
-OpheIia!
...may vioIets spring.
HoId off the earth tiII I"ve caught her
one more time in mine arms.
Now piIe your dust
upon the quick and dead...
untiI of this fIat
you have a mountain made!
What is he whose grief bears
such an emphasis...
whose sorrow conjures the stars and
makes them stand Iike wondered ears?
-The deviI take thy souI!
-I Ioved OpheIia.
4O thousand brothers with aII
their Iove cannot make up my sum!
What wiIt thou do for her?
Show me what thou wiIt do!
WiIt thou weep, fight,
tear thyseIf, drink up easeI...
eat a crocodiIe?
Dost thou come here to whine?
PIuck them asunder.
What is the reason
you use me thus?
I Ioved you ever.
But it doth not matter.
In my heart there was a kind of
fighting that wouId not Iet me sIeep.
RashIy, and praised be rashness for it,
for it Iets us know our indiscretions...
do sometimes serve us weII
when our deep pIots do paII.
That shouId teach us there"s
a divinity that shapes our ends.
Rough-hew them how we wiII.
WiII wouId thou hear
how I did proceed?
I do beseech you.
Upfrommycabin,in the dark...
gropedl, to unseal
theirgrandcommission...
where lfound,Horatio...
anexact command.
Myheadshouldbe struckoff.
Here"s the comission.
Read it at more Ieisure.
Beingthusbenettedround
wlth villainies...
lsat me down,deviseda
newcommission, wrote lt fair.
Anearnest conjuration
from the King...
that upon viewandknowing
ofthese contents...
he shouldthese bearers
put to suddendeath.
So GuiIdenstern
and Rosencrantz go to it.
They made Iove to this empIoyment.
They are not near my conscience.
Their defeat does by their own
insinuation grow. "Tis dangerous...
when the baser nature comes between
the pass and feII incensed points...
of mighty opposites. Does it not,
think thee, he that kiIIed my King...
and whored my mother, is it not
perfect to quit him with this arm?
It must be shortIy known to him
what is the issue of the business.
It wiII be short.
The interim is mine.
A man"s Iife"s no more
than to say ""one"".
But I am very sorry,
good Horatio...
that to Laertes I forgot myseIf.
For by the image of my cause
I see the portraiture of his.
I"II court his favors.
The King, sir.
He hath wagered that in a dozen
passes between you and Laertes...
he shaII not exceed you 3 hits.
He hath Iaid on tweIve nine...
and it couId be an immediate triaI,
if you wouId vouchsafe an answer.
How if I answer no?
If it pIease His Majesty, it is the
breathing time of day with me.
You"II Iose, my Iord.
I do not think so.
But thou wouIdst not think
how iII aII"s here about my heart.
If your mind disIike anything,
obey it.
I wiII forestaII their repair
hither, say you are not fit.
No, not awhit.
We defy augury.
There"s speciaI providence
in the faII of asparrow.
If it be now, "tis not to come;
if it be not to come, it wiII be now.
If it be not now, yet it wiII come.
The readiness is aII.
Since no man has aught of what he
Ieaves, what "s it to Ieave betimes?
Let be.
HamIet, this pearI is thine.
Here"s to thy heaIth.
Give me your pardon, sir.
I"ve done you wrong.
But pardon it,
as you are a gentIeman.
This presence knows how I am
punished with asore distraction.
What I have done that might your
nature, honor, and exception...
roughIy awake, I here
procIaim as madness.
Let my discIaiming from purposed eviI
free me in your generous thoughts...
that I have shot my arrow
over the house...
and hurt my brother.
Give us the foiIs.
This is too heavy,
Iet me see another.
This one Iikes me weII.
-These foiIs are aII a Iength?
-Ay, my good Iord.
Is your skiII shaII, Iike astar in
the darkest night, stick fiery off.
You mock me, sir.
No, by this hand.
Cousin HamIet...
...you know the wager?
-Very weII, my Iord.
-You Iaid the odds on the weaker.
-I do not fear it.
I"ve seen you both. But since he is
bettered, we have therefore odds.
Set me the stoups of wine
upon the tabIe.
The King drinks to HamIet.
Come, sir.
Come, my Iord.
-Judgement?
-A hit. A paIpabIe hit.
-WeII, again.
-Stay!
Give me a drink.
Give him the cup.
I"II pIay this bout first.
Set it aside awhiIe.
Another hit.
What say you?
A touch, a touch.
I do confess it.
Our son shaII win.
HamIet, take my napkin.
Rub thy brows.
The Queen carouses
to thy fortune, HamIet!
I pray you, pardon me.
Come...
Iet me wipe thy face.
Come, Laertes!
You do but daIIy. I pray you pass
with your best vioIence.
Say you so.
Come on!
Thy mother"s poisoned.
The King...
The King is to bIame.
Horatio...
I am dead...
thou Iivest.
Report me and my cause aright
to the unsatisfied.
And if thou didst ever
hoId me in thy heart...
absent thee from feIicity awhiIe,
and in this harsh worId...
draw thy breath in pain
to teII my story.
The rest is siIence.
Now cracks a nobIe heart.
Good night...
sweet prince.
And fIights of angeIs

Oh,prouddeath, what feast is
