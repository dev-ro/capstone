Doctor, I feel I have to tell you that
this has to be my last session with you.
I got fired yesterday.
Look, what's the use?
I can't afford this sort of thing anymore.
Mr. Harris, do you really believe
I'd stop seeing you now,
at a time like this,
just because you couldn't afford it?
I think it's something we should
go into in the next session.
Sure thing.
- Next Thursday at 4:00, right?
- Right.
Dr. Rice, this is Nick Dine.
I can't make my 11:00 session tomorrow.
I'll see you next week.
Hi, Sam, it's Sarah here.
I'm just calling to let you know
that the divorce is final.
I hope you like your new apartment.
If there's anything you need...
...And hit a grand slam homerun
- that has Red Sox on top ﬁve...
- No.
We're in the ninth inning now,
the Yankees do have to face the ball with
two men out, in the bat of Bucky Dent.
Bucky with three hits
in the ball game, two to null,
has a chance to be another hero.
He is the ﬁrst pitch to hit a...
Rick Ferrell is kicking hard
with his right.
He leaps, grabs the ball, he grabs on
to the ball, fall onto the ground, and...
Well, Bucky, it's not the '78 playoffs.
Wow, what a catch by Rick Ferrell,
which will take a sure victory
away from the Yankees.
Dr. Rice?
My name is Brooke Reynolds.
I was a friend of George Bynum.
I was wondering if could talk to you
for a moment.
I promise I won't take much time.
Certainly.
Come in.
Sit down.
I was sorry to hear about George.
- When something like this happens...
- Dr. Rice, George left this in my apartment.
And before I could return it to him,
I heard that he had been...
That he was dead.
I...
I thought his wife should have it.
I don't know her.
I mean, I've met her once or twice, but...
What I'm trying to say is, I don't think
she knows anything about George and me.
And I don't see any reason
why she should be hurt by this now.
I thought if...
If you could return it to her
and not mention anything about me.
I thought you could say that,
he left it here in, in your office,
the last time he was here or...
Wouldn't it have been simpler
if you had just mailed it to her?
Do you wanna talk about this?
Yes, yes. I need someone...
Excuse me.
- Yes?
- Dr. Rice,
I tried to call you this morning,
but there wasn't any answer.
I'm Detective Joseph Vitucci,
Homicide Central.
I wonder...
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Don't worry about it.
Can I pay you?
So stupid of me.
Could you step
into the waiting room, please?
I'll be with you in a moment.
Here. Why don't you use this door.
No one will see you leave.
I've got it.
Miss Reynolds.
Thank you.
Okay.
Dr. Rice. Joseph Vitucci.
Detective First Class, Homicide Central.
- How do you do?
- I appreciate your taking the time.
It's all right.
Sit down.
- You're a psychologist, huh?
- Psychiatrist.
All right, I-A-T-R-I-S-T.
- That's right.
- Okay.
And George Bynum was your patient, huh?
Yes.
Now, how long have you been treating him?
Twice a week for two years.
And last time you saw him?
Thursday, the 22nd, 5:30.
Do you mind?
Okay. Now, anything happened,
like, you know, threats,
attempts on his life,
anything that he mentioned, you know?
No.
Okay, how about anybody
he was having trouble with?
Nothing.
What exactly was it that
you were treating the deceased for?
I'm sorry,
that's confidential information.
Okay.
But if you think of anything
that's not confidential,
I would appreciate it
if you would give me a call.
Sure.
Listen, Dr. Rice. If I were you,
I'd be careful for a little while.
What I mean is if I thought you knew
something about George Bynum's death,
the guy that killed him
might get the same idea.
January 4th: First session
with George Bynum.
Referred by Jack Berger, 47,
married, good health,
works at Crispins, the auction gallery.
He said the pre-Columbian statue
on my desk was a cheap copy.
Told me I watered the plants too much.
Finally admitted he was
having trouble sleeping.
I'm afraid I've really done it this time.
My assistant quit.
And I'd promised the job
to a girl who works with me.
I mean, we'd been having a... You know?
Well, anyway, yesterday afternoon,
this woman came walking into my office.
I don't know why, but...
before I knew what was happening,
I'd offered her the job.
Her name's Brooke Reynolds.
She is very shy, very subdued.
I really am in a lot of trouble.
March 22nd.
Crispins is handling the Maddow estate.
He's a big collector of antiquities.
Mostly Archaic Greek and Coptic.
There's a lot of cataloging to be done.
Here.
Take it.
See, you can hold it,
you can touch it, you can feel it.
- You don't have to be afraid of it.
- It's so beautiful.
How long do you think it took him
to make that?
Three or four days, I should say.
Now, here's a man who lived
500 years before Christ,
who probably didn't even know
how to read and write,
who never went more than
a few miles from beyond his village.
And yet he has made something
that has outlived Caesar,
has outlived Lorenzo De' Medici,
has outlived Napoleon.
And if you don't drop it,
it will outlive you and me.
I am sorry I'm late.
I got a call from a patient.
Oh.
- You're not dressed.
- Mother, I'm sorry.
I just forgot all about it.
What's that supposed to mean?
It's supposed to mean "hmm," that's all.
It's not like you
to forget Uncle Charlie's party.
- You're his favorite.
- Got a lot of work to do.
- Sam, is something wrong?
- No, I'm fine.
Have you
heard from Sarah lately?
Yeah.
She called to say the divorce was final.
Do me a favor, don't start
that "hmm" stuff again, okay?
I'm in no mood for it.
Look, just tell Uncle Charlie
I'm sorry I couldn't make it.
Come on, Sam. Uncle Charlie's not so bad.
Besides, how long is it since
you've gone out and seen people?
I appreciate what you're trying to do,
but I don't need a social director.
All right, Sam, what's happening?
I lost a patient.
What happened?
A guy named George Bynum.
It was all over the Daily News.
- Stabbed to death.
- That's awful.
You wanna know the truth?
I'll tell you the truth.
I think he would have been better off
seeing a priest or a rabbi.
Come on, Sam.
Instead of paying 75 bucks an hour
to a doctor who can't even hold
his own marriage together.
Now, you listen to me.
I'm not talking mother-son,
I'm talking shrink to shrink.
When a man's wife leaves him,
- after seven years of marriage...
- Eight.
Eight years of marriage.
There's supposed to be some kind
of emotional reaction.
He's supposed to feel a lot of pain.
He's supposed to feel a lot of anger.
It's not particularly pleasant,
but he's got to go through it.
- But what...
- But in my case,
I'm creating an elaborate system
of highly structured activities
so I can avoid dealing
with my own emotion.
But then there's nothing really new
about that, is there?
Okay?
Just tell Uncle Charlie I can't make it,
and I'll take a rain check.
April 15th.
I think George Bynum
is in some kind of trouble.
At today's session,
he was distracted and upset.
Listen, doctor.
Let me ask you a question, okay?
I mean, just hypothetically.
Now, what if
you found out
that someone you knew
had actually killed somebody,
and because her family is rich,
nobody found out about it?
Actually, I'm the only one
who knows about it.
Except for you.
Anyway, what I wanted to know
is if somebody
had done something like that
before, killed somebody.
Is it likely that they would do it again?
Angelo?
Angelo?
Anybody out there?
Who's there?
Dr. Rice?
- What happened to the light?
- I don't know.
Somebody must have pulled
the wrong switch.
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
The doorman said you might be down here.
I'm very sorry
if I'm disturbing you, but...
I felt very, very badly
about breaking that figurine
in your office this afternoon so I...
I brought you...
Come on inside.
Just a second, I'll get the lights.
Here, let me take your coat.
Oh, no, I can't stay.
I just wanted to give you this.
Here, let me. May I?
I hope you like her.
She's a...
She's a Tanagra.
They were terracotta figures,
made in Greece in the third century BC.
She's very delicate.
This was probably a small bowl
or a sheaf of wheat,
that she's carrying
in the hand that's missing.
These little figures were placed in tombs
to keep the dead from being so lonely.
I gave back the watch.
I didn't mention anything about you.
Look...
I think I know what you're going through.
I mean, when you lose
someone you love, you...
If there's any way that I can help,
not as a doctor, but just to talk.
You don't understand.
I didn't love George.
I don't know what he told you about me.
Well, it's late. I have to go.
If you change your mind...
All right.
You know, the more I could see
of that new girl in the office,
the more I think
that she's definitely your type.
And what do you think that is?
Stiff.
I mean, she's very tense.
One look at her and you know that
what she really needs is a good...
May 19th.
There's something very bizarre going on
with your little girlfriend, Miss Reynolds.
You remember, I had told you
that she'd moved into
an apartment building right behind mine.
Which I find very significant.
Anyway, last night I was getting dressed,
to go out to have some dinner
with some friends.
June 23rd.
George Bynum canceled
his next two sessions.
He let me know that he was going
away with his girlfriend.
Well, you haven't asked me about Brooke.
Aren't you curious about her?
Should I be?
I took a photograph of her.
Come to think of it,
you never ask me about Brooke.
You ask me about my wife.
You ask me about my boss.
But you never ask me about Brooke.
Why is that, doctor?
You know, I think you're beginning
to have a problem about her.
September 19th.
The patient reported a dream
in today's session.
In the dream,
he was walking down a wooded lane.
Yes, may I help you?
I have an appointment
with a Detective Vitucci.
- Dr. Rice?
- Yes.
Be right with you. I'll take care of this.
Let me get back
to you on Monday, all right?
Okay, bye-bye.
Hi, I'm Gail Phillips.
I was one of George Bynum's assistants.
- How do you do?
- I'll show you the way upstairs.
- Have you been to Crispins before?
- No.
Shall I give you the tour?
It's a long walk.
- Why not.
- All right.
Crispins is the oldest auction house
in the United States.
It was founded in 1811, it's been
in continuous operation ever since.
Crispins has branches
in London, New York, Paris,
Geneva, Boston and Los Angeles.
We have an excellent Blue Cross
program for our employees,
which covers full psychiatric benefits.
But I'm sure George Bynum
must have told you about that.
Downstairs are the conference rooms,
the auction room,
and the exhibition room.
Up here on the fourth floor, this is
where all the slave labor takes place.
Quite a mess, isn't it?
My.
It actually all gets
sorted out eventually.
Sorry.
Where do all this stuff come from?
Estates, galleries, private collections.
Actually, most of it comes
from just ordinary people.
Now, once things get to Crispins,
after they're receipted,
they're all sent
to their proper department.
Sculpture to the sculpture department,
and prints to the print department,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
And then about a week before the auction,
everything is sent downstairs
into the exhibition rooms.
And the night before,
it's all put backstage.
And finally, on the day of the sale,
it's put up for auction and hopefully sold.
That's the end of the speech,
the end of the tour.
The police.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate your coming over.
I know you're a busy man,
I'll try not to keep you too long.
No problem.
Miss Wilson, yeah,
please come in now, okay?
Thanks.
Yesterday when we were talking,
you said that the deceased
came to see you twice a week, right?
According to this, Bynum
was seeing you five times a week.
That's impossible.
Miss Wilson, how often did Mr. Bynum
have an appointment with his psychiatrist?
Five times a week.
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.
If that's all, I have a lot work to do.
Fine. Thanks, Miss Wilson.
Please close the door.
We found out that Bynum was fooling around
with at least one of the women here.
And I think he was using you as the cover.
And you're gonna ask me who that is?
And you're gonna tell me
that's confidential information.
Since yesterday
I found out a couple more things.
First, we're pretty sure
Bynum was killed by a woman.
Second, since his wife was in Florida
at the time, we know it wasn't her.
And third, the guys at Forensic came up
with a sort of psychological
portrait of the killer.
And they think she'll try it again.
Doctor, I get the feeling you know
a lot more than you're telling me.
- Wait a minute.
- I don't know what you're trying to hide.
Wait a minute.
George Bynum was a patient of mine
for almost two years.
And I'm just as much concerned
about what happened to him as you are.
Dr. Rice.
I don't know what they can do to
a psychiatrist who withholds information,
but I can promise you this for a fact.
You're gonna end up in a lot of trouble
if you don't get yourself killed first.
Thank you for coming over.
- Yes?
- Mom, Sam.
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm fine.
Listen, why don't you and I
have dinner tonight.
I thought I'd order
in some Chinese, and...
All right, Sam, what's wrong?
Well, as a matter of fact,
I got a little problem.
What would you say if I told you
that I'd been to bed with your girlfriend?
You aren't curious?
Anyway, night before last,
Brooke and I were working late.
Everybody else had gone home.
And...
I don't know why.
I guess, I just wanted to see
what would happen.
I reached out and put my hand
on the back of her neck.
She didn't make a move.
She didn't say a word.
And I kissed her.
And then I started to unbutton her blouse.
And I put my hand on her.
And she didn't make a move to stop me.
What did you tell the police about me?
Nothing.
- What's the matter?
- Don't lie to me, please.
That detective had me in his office
all afternoon.
- You must have told him something.
- They're questioning everyone
- who worked with George.
- No, no, no, that's not it.
He knew something else.
I could tell.
Brooke, I think it's very naive
of you to think
that they're not gonna find out
about you sooner or later.
Not if you don't tell them!
You're the only one who knew about us.
What is it you're so afraid of?
I was with him the night he was killed.
We, we had been having this affair,
and I was trying...
I told him I'd meet him,
one last time at the bar near Crispins.
He's...
It got very ugly.
And I told him that
I never wanted to see him again.
And he laughed at me.
He told me there was no way on Earth
that he would ever allow that to happen.
So I left. I just walked out.
He followed me, he tried
to make me get in the car with him.
I wouldn't go. I walked home.
I left him there.
I must have been the last person
to see him alive.
When I woke up in the morning
I saw the papers.
I couldn't believe it.
It was...
It was horrible.
I saw the picture.
This man that I thought I'd loved.
It was horrible, but you know what I felt?
I felt relieved.
All I kept thinking was...
I'm so glad.
I'm so glad he's out of my life.
Don't you think that there's something
a little bit wrong with that?
I mean, with me?
First of all,
let's get one thing straight.
You're not responsible
for what happened to George Bynum,
just because you're glad he's dead.
And whatever you're feeling now,
guilt, remorse, whatever it is,
it's human, it's understandable,
it's something we all share.
Nothing wrong with that.
It's my mother.
I'll call you later.
And that's when he wakes from the dream.
Okay, let's have one last go
at the traditional stuff.
- Box woman.
- Green jealousy.
So we start by considering the possibility
that we're dealing with a jealous woman.
Since George Bynum puts the box
in his pocket,
I can only assume that he thinks he has some
sort of control over the jealous woman.
Until something goes wrong
and she gets loose.
What about the little girl?
Did he tell you
why he was frightened of her?
He gave me the dream, that's all.
I can only think that she's
some sort of displacement
- for the mother or the sister.
- No, no, not at all.
We're probably dealing with a woman
who on the surface
seems childlike and innocent,
but underneath is capable
of extreme violence.
Sam, I still think you should go
to the police.
With what?
What kind of evidence do I have?
A green box and a little girl
who's mean to her teddy bear.
Come on, Grace, you know better than that.
Well, if you're not going to the police,
why are you getting mixed up in this?
I told you before, I spent almost two years,
two hours a week, talking to this man.
I wanna find out why he was killed.
Sam, you're not equipped to deal
with this sort of thing.
If you don't look out, you're going to put
yourself in a very dangerous position.
- Go to the police, please.
- I'll think about it.
Sam.
Mom.
Do you remember when I wanted
to quit school and play pro-ball?
When I got that offer from that
Class A team, in Knoxville?
I called you up and I told you
what I wanted to do,
and you got on the first train
to New Haven.
- If you had really wanted to quit...
- Really wanted to quit,
I wouldn't have called you, okay.
And you sat with me for six hours,
and you let me talk myself out of it.
You were right and I'm not sorry.
I mean, I'm a much better shrink than I ever
would have been a second baseman.
But I closed some kind of a door that day.
And I've been closing them ever since.
What I'm doing now may be irrational.
Maybe it is foolish.
But I gotta do it.
Oh, Sam.
Who's there?
Brooke?
All right, give me all your money.
All right.
Okay.
I've got about 50 or 60 here.
I'll take that, man!
Now look, I...
I know this sounds a little crazy, but...
I'd like to ask you a favor.
My wallet.
You want my wallet, don't you?
Master Charge, Visa, American Express?
Hey, look, man.
- You try something with me...
- Oh, no, no.
I just want you to stay here,
and watch me.
And make sure I get out to the park okay.
Okay?
Your coat.
What?
I want your coat, give me your coat.
You got it.
- Now, I ain't gonna tell you again.
- All right.
Thanks a lot.
Personal effects will be returned to you
as soon as Forensics is through with them.
About your coat, tough luck.
Now, would you mind telling me
just what you were doing here?
I was having a problem with a patient.
Decided to go for a walk
and think things out.
In Central Park?
You took a walk?
Well, I went a little further
than I intended.
And somebody grabbed me, that's it.
You're kidding.
Murray, do me a favor.
Call the squad and see what they want.
You got it.
Doctor, I think there's something
here you don't understand.
Someone tried to kill you last night.
I don't buy that.
Look, a patient of mine was murdered
for whatever reasons.
A couple of days later,
by coincidence, I go for a walk.
I go into the park, I get mugged.
The guy who mugs me, gets mugged himself.
He puts up a struggle, he gets killed.
I mean, that happens every day.
First, the guy was killed because
he was wearing your coat, okay?
Now, second, I just lost five bucks
to this schnook,
because the pattern of the wounds
is the same as George Bynum's.
And I got another 20
says she's not finished yet.
Who is it?
It's me, Sam. I've gotta talk to you.
Hi.
Mr. Chong, this is Dr. Rice.
Dr. Rice, Mr. Chong.
Where were you last night?
I went back to Crispins
and tried to do some work.
I called you about 11:00 or 11:30 and...
I went for a walk.
You were gone forever.
I called a couple of times.
It's a long walk.
It wasn't anything important.
- I was just wondering...
- I was just... What?
You do this sort of thing regularly?
Oh, I have a bad back.
Mr. Chong usually comes at night,
but today is his daughter's birthday.
When will I see you again?
My last patient is at 7:00.
There's a very important auction
tonight at Crispins.
And...
And I'm going to be handling
the bidding for an Italian client.
One of the pieces should go
for over a million dollars so...
if you've never been to an auction,
maybe you would find it...
very, very...
exciting.
Sure it would be.
It starts at 8:00.
I've got a patient in about half an hour.
Sam.
Yeah?
Nothing.
Sam.
What did you want to see me about?
Nothing.
Dr. Rice?
Brooke asked me to watch out for you.
Would you come with me please?
I can't tell you how much Mr. Bynum's
death has upset everyone around here.
This afternoon, Gail Phillips and I
were talking about it,
and Brooke got angry
and told us to shut up.
Doctor, I'm really very worried about her.
Well, Brooke is waiting
for you in her office.
It's the one at the end.
It's the only one with the light on.
- Well...
- Thank you very much.
Bye.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- How did you get up here?
- Heather.
Heather.
Yeah.
I just came up here
to get some last minute bids.
Brooke?
Are you there?
The auction's starting. You better hurry.

That concludes tonight's auction of important

part one of the Alex Maddow collection.
Thank you all very much,
ladies and gentlemen.
Your purchases are ready downstairs.
And remember that part two
of the Maddow Estate sale
will continue tomorrow morning
here at Crispins
with important
Greek and Roman antiquities.
You've been a wonderful audience.
Thank you all again. Good night.
- Miss Phillips? Excuse me.
- Oh, hi.
- Can I talk to you for a moment please?
- Sure.
I'm trying to locate Brooke Reynolds.
She was gonna meet me here half an hour ago.
- Do you have any idea where she is?
- Haven't seen her since the sale.
- Did you try her apartment?
- Yes, she's not there.
Well, you might call her
tomorrow morning at work.
She gets in between 9:30 and 10:00.
Wait a minute. I've gotta talk to her,
it's very important.
Oh, she's gonna kill me.
Her parents have a house out in Long Island.
She goes out there sometimes.
- Where?
- It's in Glen Cove.
- It's on Wood Street or Wood Lane.
- Okay, thanks.
Brooke?
Anybody here?
Miss Phillips?
Oh, my God... You scared me to death.
I'm sorry to bother you this late.
I was wondering if I could talk
to you for a few minutes.
Well, it's important.
It's about Miss Reynolds.
Sure.
You wanna come up?
How did you find me?
What's-her-name?
Your friend that works with you.
She told me you might be out here.
All right, it was wrong for me
to go through your desk.
I'm sorry about that.
I mean, I can understand how you feel.
How can you understand how I feel
if you don't know anything about me?
You're right.
I don't know anything about you.
But I know this much, I know the police
think you killed George Bynum.
What do you think?
Do you think I killed him?
No.
But you're not sure.
Listen to me!
On account of you,
I'm an accessory to something,
I don't know what.
I'm withholding evidence,
I'm obstructing justice.
I'm gonna get my license revoked
if I'm not thrown into jail first.
And on top of that, I've just spent $15,000
for a painting I don't even like.
That's the man in the clipping.
That's my father.
Sam, I don't know how those things
got into my desk.
- All that happened a long time ago.
- All what?
My father's death.
What happened?
This house belonged to my mother.
I grew up here.
They separated when I was very little.
But I remember...
Well, that's when she started to drink.
Anyway, I was 16.
I was away at school when...
they called and told me that
she finally drank herself to death.
They didn't say that, but...
That's what it was.
I remember I felt...
nothing for her.
No remorse, nothing.
After the funeral, my father came,
and took me back with him to Florence.
I lived there for two years.
And it was the happiest
I've ever been in my whole life.
Then, on my 18th birthday in June,
I came into my inheritance.
They had all the lawyers flew over,
and lots documents to sign.
And in and among all these papers
there was a...
a letter that she'd written to me,
not long before she died.
In it, she said...
She said she'd always loved me.
And she was sorry
that I hadn't known that.
She told me, my father...
had turned me against her
and that that had broken her heart.
She said he never loved her.
He just was interested in her money.
And she said, he never loved me either.
That he only pretended to
as a weapon against her.
She said she was afraid for me.
She said...
I should be very, very careful of him, that
he would do anything... for the money.
So I was supposed to...
I was supposed to go back that afternoon,
and sign all these papers, but I couldn't, I...
I didn't. I went to a chapel
that was near us and...
Just to be alone, but there were
a lot of tourists there,
so I went up into the bell tower.
My father followed me.
He was very upset. He wanted
to know what was in the letter.
I wouldn't...
I wouldn't tell... I didn't wanna see him.
I just wanted to get away, but he...
He wouldn't let me
so I showed him the letter.
He was shaking.
And I remember,
the paper was shaking as he read it.
When he was done,
he folded it up very carefully,
and he gave it back to me.
And then he made a joke, about my mother.
That...
That she was probably...
drunk when she wrote it
or something like that.
Then he smiled at me.
And I knew that she was right about him.
He came towards me with his arms out.
I suppose to embrace me.
But the look on his face, it terrified me.
I shook him off, and he got very angry.
He grabbed me and he pushed me
against the barricade.
I tried to pull away,
but that made him furious.
And he held me hard against this rail,
and I was sure
that it was going to give way.
And then I thought,
"That's what he is trying to do."
"He's trying to kill me."
And I got wild, I just, I...
I twisted myself around
and I hit him as hard as I could.
He fell backwards.
I guess he must have lost his balance,
the whole railway broke loose,
and he went down, and he said my name.
But I couldn't move.
I just couldn't move.
They said he died instantly.
I just don't...
There was...
some scandal,
at first, but it never...
There wasn't even a formal inquest.
Everyone knew
how much we loved each other.
And you kept this buried?
- Until you told George Bynum?
- No, no, I never told George this.
But he knew.
Yes, he did.
How?
I don't know how.
I don't know.
When I explained to him
that there was no use
in our seeing each other anymore,
that's when he told me
he knew all about it.
He threatened me.
He said he would bring it all up again.
I couldn't, I couldn't bear it.
- And that was here in this house.
- Yes.
- How did you know that?
- Because Bynum had a dream.
And this house was in the dream,
and so was the person who killed him.
In the dream, Bynum comes
to this house late at night.
He enters a room where all the furniture
is covered with sheets.
Against a far wall
is a large Oriental cabinet,
like the one in your office.
Inside, there's a green box.
He takes the box
and puts it in his pocket.
He sees a little girl sitting in a chair.
She's holding a stuffed animal.
She reaches across
and pulls out one of the eyes.
The animal starts to bleed.
Sam, I don't know
why you're doing this, I don't know.
He turns and looks for a door...
which leads to a long hallway.
He tries to get away from her,
but she begins to follow him.
The hallway opens up...
into a large room.
With a lot of French doors.
He tries to get out,
but the doors are locked.
By now the child has followed him
into the room.
He looks around and sees a staircase.
He starts towards the...
Wait a minute.
There is no staircase.
Yes, there is.
He starts up the steps.
When he gets to the top,
he tries the door, but it won't open.
He can feel the child getting closer.
Finally, the door opened,
steps inside, closes it behind him.
And then he takes the green box
out of his pocket.
It slips through his ﬁngers.
It's not a green box.
It sounds like green box, but it isn't.
Gail Phillips at Crispins, she has a...
She doesn't trust banks for some reason.
She takes her paycheck and she cashes it,
and carries the money with her.
Someone I forget who's...
George started calling her
green bucks and it stuck.
Oh, my God, I've gotta call the police.
- Why? What's the matter?
- Gail Phillips killed George Bynum.
- How can you know that?
- The dream.
If I'm right, they were having an affair,
before you went to work at Crispins.
In Gail's mind, you were the one
who ruined everything.
If it weren't for you,
George Bynum would still be alive.
You see, when he rejected her
for you, she killed him.
And now she's trying
to make it look as if you did it.
Yeah.
Detective Joseph Vitucci, please.
Dr. Sam Rice calling.
I'm pretty sure Gail's the one
who put those clippings in your desk
hoping the police would find them.
And if that doesn't work,
she's gonna have to kill you.
Would you please try and find him,
it's very important.
Wait a minute.
Who told you that I was out here?
I think we had better go.
Oh, my God.
- What?
- I forgot my keys.
Brooke!
Jump.
What?
- Jump.
- Don't!
No!
