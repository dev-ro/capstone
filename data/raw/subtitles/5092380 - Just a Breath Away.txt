We are about to begin our descent
to Paris.
Please remain seated
and fasten your seatbelt.
Local time is 11:22 am.
Thank you for flying Air France...
Call Sarah.
Hi, Dad.
- What's up?
- Hurry home.
Give me...
65 minutes.
Traffic's heavy.
See you soon then.
See you.
Dad, I'm waiting for you.
Coming to Mom's?
Give me a second, sweetheart.
Mr Belkacem, let me help.
- How are you?
- So-so.
I'm too hot. Yesterday, I was cold.
It's crazy.
The planet's going haywire.
Pollution is high.
You shouldn't go out too much.
Yes, I know but...
I'm not a child, you know.
I'm 77, young man.
I've seen worse.
All right.
If you need help, just ask.
Thank you.
- Hi.
- You OK?
Yeah. I have a lesson.
Dad, is that you?
Yes, I'm here.
Go on. I have to finish.
You took ages!
- How are you?
- I'm OK.
- A present?
- Surprise.
- You've grown.
- Don't exaggerate.
It's only been a week.
Looking nice.
For Noé or me?
When'll you talk?
Don't let Mom hear.
Come on...
Why not tell her?
I don't know.
She'd be upset.
He's not even my boyfriend.
Essences?
- From Canada?
- Yes.
Weren't you in Marseille?
Take them out.
The Rockies?
Breathtaking.
Is it working?
Yeah.
Classy. Thanks.
Beautiful, huh?
Awesome.
Finish pages 40 to 45,
and read the spectral waves
section again.
I'm sure it will be in the final exam..
Yeah... Good.
See you next Tuesday Thomas.
Bye bye.
Poor kid. He does his best,
but he'll never pass.
- Want a coffee?
- No.
How was the interview?
Are they hiring you?
Listen...
OK.
You weren't in Marseille.
No, I wasn't in Marseille.
I was in Canada.
I've found something.
A promising new protocol.
They can take Sarah.
Why weren't we told?
It's new.
Unpublished.
Read the report. It's crazy.
The thing is
we'd have to move there.
Move to Canada?
Yes.
Mathieu...
Dr Chabrier would have told us...
Chabrier knows nothing!
They're making terrific progress there!
Why always complicate things?
She's home at last.
She has a life now.
It's not a life.
I've uploaded it. It's awesome.
There's even an ice wall...
Your dad keeps us entertained.
- He's good.
- Yep!
He's ace.
Say the Goldfish thank him.
Don't call us that!
We're goldfish in bowls...
You're a caged monkey.
You're right!
Cut it out.
A monkey...
I'll unpack.
Just think about it.
When I see real results.
No, now.
She'll leave her bubble.
Whatever the doctors say,
one day she'll leave it.
I can tell.
One day, I'll hug my daughter
and she'll have a real life.
It's not that simple.
We've been trying for 12 years.
We need to know more.
Alexis!
Don't answer!
What's up?
She's in love.
That's bullshit.
C'mon, it's obvious.
You're busted.
He hung up.
It's important.
I'll call him back.
You can't...
She blew us off!
You're jealous.
No, but the guy's too arrogant.
France's first Stimberger case,
seen on TV...
He beat you by a few weeks.
Exactly.
And it'd have been different.
An unprecedented natural disaster
has struck Sweden and Denmark.
An earthquake
of 6.7 on the Richter scale,
never seen before...
Shit!
Dad?
I'm here.
Was that an earthquake?
I think so. Is the power off?
Yeah.
The battery kicked in?
Mom's checking.
It seems to be working.
I'm coming over just in case.
What's happening?
Dad, what are the sirens?
The tremor, I guess.
Tell Mom I'll be right there.
Run!
Get away from the window!
- Move!
- What is it?
No idea. Don't inhale.
Is it toxic?
Sarah, we have to leave you!
What?
We can't!
She's safe.
He's right.
We'll fetch you!
We'll be back, angel!
Quick!
Open up!
It's Anna from the second floor!
What's going on?
- Can we reach the roof?
- From the balcony but....
It's settling.
Do you have towels?
Yes, but what for?
To seal the door.
The radio...
Here.
Sarah, is there gas in the bubble?
I don't know.
There's smoke all around.
And near the lock...
What?
What, Sarah?
Answer me!
- What?
- I'm going back!
We can't go down!
Mom? Dad? Can you hear me?
Yes, we hear you.
Is there smoke in your bubble?
Don't worry. The filter's working.
Would you mind telling us
what's going on?
Yes, I mean...
It's all right.
My God...
I'm sure Rémi is fine. Don't worry.
Come.
What a nightmare...
Do you think it's lethal?
What is this stuff?
It's too big for an explosion.
An attack?
Come in.
Any higher, it will kill us.
Does this go in the cooler?
No, you can leave the jam there.
Put the rest in the cooler.
Can you do it?
Hold on.
Sarah, I need to check
that my app works.
Understand?
How much battery left?
I can't see.
Hold on. Got it.
There are four bars.
Sure?
Mom...
That's perfect then.
That means we have
at least 10 hours.
When'll the power be back?
Soon, honey.
It won't last.
And we're nearby.
Still no connection.
Our son lives two streets away.
But on the ground floor.
My boy's smart. A bit like you.
He'll have found a good place to hide.
I'm sure you're right.
Shall we go?
- Where?
- Rémi's waiting.
I hate being late.
I told you about the mist.
We'll wait for it to clear.
And then,
we'll go to see Rémi.
All right.
My wife is a bit...
She occasionally forgets things.
Read to keep busy.
Dad's back. I'll ask him.
Don't worry, dear.
We'll talk soon.
You climbed up?
It's everywhere.
As far as the eye can see.
It's not moving.
Any rescue teams?
I didn't see any.
And the choppers?
How is she?
Her battery's at four bars.
But if the smoke doesn't clear...
She won't last the night.
I've had it for years.
They tried selling me another but...
this one works perfectly.
It's been a while now
since I used it...
My specs?
Here.
All right...
- Let's see...
- May I?
It's all right,
it'll only take a minute.
I know these things.
I was a radio operator
for over two years.
I'll be back.
In the Resistance.
- Rubbish.
- What?
The contacts are dead.
It won't work.
We need to go down somehow.
We'd have to hold our breath
for 4 minutes to get to Sarah.
It's impossible.
Getting back up is the problem.
You'd need a minute
to change the battery.
What? What is it?
Mr Belkacem.
He has oxygen!
Good idea but shouldn't we wait?
No, it's just below.
Will this do?
Perfect. Thank you.
What if you fall or inhale the gas?
The battery has hours left.
We can't be sure.
I may not reach the window later.
Be careful.
I'll be back.
Mathieu!
Mathieu!
I'm fine.
I've found the mask.
I'll check on Sarah.
Good idea!
Sarah.
Dad!
OK, sweetheart?
I'm scared.
I can imagine, but be strong.
This might last.
I've brought food.
Is that a mask?
I found an oxygen tank.
A flashlight
and these for the radio.
Your battery...
Listen to me.
Help will come
but economize supplies.
I have to go.
Already?
I have no choice.
You must be brave, OK.
I'm proud of you.
I'll be back soon.
I'm right upstairs.
See you later.
Keep moving!
Stick together!
We'll turn left now.
Left!
This way!
Where are you going?
Follow the group.
Our convoy is 30 minutes away.
We're going to Montmartre.
It's above the mist.
We're taking everyone we can.
Use this, it's better.
Pure oxygen makes you dizzy.
Thank you.
What is this smoke?
No idea.
It's not a gas attack.
It's from underground.
How far does it go?
I know no more than you.
Follow me now.
I can't.
It's total chaos, OK.
We may not come back this way.
My family's waiting for me.
It's your call.
Wait!
Can I take another mask?
My daughter has Stimberger's.
She's in her bubble.
I can't get to her otherwise.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
He's still not back?
No.
He left my room ages ago.
Sarah, angel, don't worry.
He'll be back soon.
Do your stretching exercises to relax.
Come on, I'll do them too.
Breathe in.
Here he is!
I told you so.
Your dad's fine.
I'll call later.
You took ages!
We were worried sick.
Sorry. I took a look outside.
I got all I could.
Where's this from?
I met some soldiers.
Soldiers?
They're taking survivors to Montmartre.
Will they come for us?
Don't count on it.
They're on foot.
We'll be sleeping here.
Want to see Sarah?
How long does a tank last?
I don't know.
Not long, I'd say.
Listen...
I'll wait.
Who knows how long it'll last.
We'd best save air.
True.
Do the soldiers know
where the mist is from?
From the ground, after the tremor.
They seemed as lost as we are.
It's chaos out there.
Your little girl
has Stimberger's syndrome, right?
Yes.
More and more children have
that genetic malformation.
We know that disease.
It's terrible.
Our son, Rémi, told us about it.
You must meet him.
He can help you.
He knows a lot of people.
You'll be less alone.
That's kind.
Let's try to sleep a bit.
All right.
Good night.
If you need anything...
Thank you.
Good night.
Keeping something from me?
The mist...
It's rising.
How quickly?
A few centimetres an hour.
We can't stay here forever.
I think we've crossed the line.
It won't get better.
It'll only get worse.
What do you mean?
I don't know but...
there must be
a tolerable number of dead,
a mortality threshold to stay under.
Beyond it, society won't recover.
You haven't seen it out there.
I think two thirds
of the Paris population died.
If it's the same elsewhere...
no public service
will be able to function.
So no more police,
no more doctors,
no technicians to restore power.
Nothing.
It'll be OK, my baby.
It'll be OK.
It's working now.
What are these tools?
From my office.
Is Sarah all right?
Yes, she was sleeping.
Good job the bubble's heated.
My place is freezing.
This is the Interior Ministry.
France is on red alert.
Please respect
the following instructions.
Enter the nearest permanent building.
Block all openings.
Stop air-conditioning,
heating and ventilation.
Leave your children at school...
Is it the same on every station?
I think so.
What's that?
Look.
What a nightmare...
It'll be hell there.
Come.
Riots?
Everyone's packed
onto the higher ground.
It's chaos.
Let's go to Charlotte's.
Charlotte, Sarah's friend?
She's in the Morvan hills.
Her parents will welcome us
and Sarah could share her bubble.
Yeah. We need a suit.
Doesn't she have to stay in her bubble?
There's a way.
Special suits let patients go out.
They cost a lot, so parents rent them.
Where are they?
In a lab in central Paris.
An hour and a half there and back.
I'll go. The department moved.
I nearly lost my way last time.
We'll go together.
You're not going out there alone.
Dad! Mom!
- OK, sweetheart?
- Fine.
- But it's taking ages.
- I know.
We'll get you a suit
in case we have to leave.
- It's not clearing?
- No.
It's not moving.
The neighbour has a radio.
Call Mr Lucien whenever you want.
Can you check on Noé?
Go there, please.
His parents were out. He's alone.
No, sweetheart... We can't.
We need to save oxygen.
He lives around the corner,
above the bicycle store.
Sarah, we just don't have time.
What would you do if it was me?
Please...
My God...
I know. Try not to look.
Let's hurry.
What's that?
Here.
Come on!
Quick!
Anna!
Anna!
Mathieu!
- It's me, Anna!
- Mathieu?
I saw you fall.
It happened so fast.
I was scared.
- I thought...
- Me too.
I thought I'd lost you.
Sure you're OK?
- Yes.
- We'll make it, OK.
- We'll make it.
- I know.
It's just here. Come on.
C5.
Miss. B4.
What did you say?
B4.
Sorry.
That's a miss too.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
It's right in front of me.
You think
the old man's losing his mind?
My turn. D2.
This way.
Here.
They were here. I don't get it.
Shit!
Here!
- That's one.
- Let's go.
Mathieu, it's this way.
What is this?
Mathieu!
I'm OK.
Are you sure?
What is it?
What is it?
Shit!
Shit...
Hold on...
Let's go!
Let me see.
Hold up your T-shirt.
Don't move.
I'll be right back.
Here I am.
Lift it up.
Hold this.
Sorry...
I'm sorry...
What?
I got it in Barcelona.
I wanted one
but never dared before.
- OK, I get it.
- I'll stop.
- Is that OK?
- Great.
- You'll manage?
- Yes.
Let me help.
No, I'm OK.
Here.
What is it?
It's nearly empty.
We can't both go back.
- We can try.
- No.
You have to go.
What?
No, I'm not leaving you here.
We have no choice.
I'll manage. You know me.
What'll you do?
Hold your breath all the way?
I'll think of something.
I can try via the rooftops.
The rooftops? That's crazy.
Anna, it can be done. Trust me.
- No...
- Listen to me.
You have to get that suit to her.
Listen to me. In that suit,
Sarah can make it to a pharmacy.
Our daughter's smart.
She'll find oxygen there.
Then anything's possible.
Going to Charlotte's is a great idea.
We can wait there
for things to get back to normal,
until it's over.
I won't manage without you.
Please.
Of course you will.
I know you both.
No one's stronger.
The women of my life.
I'll join you, you'll see.
Dumb optimism has its advantages.
I fear nothing.
Go.
Thank God, you made it.
And your husband?
He had to stay there.
- Is Sarah OK?
- Your daughter's fine.
Don't worry.
No...
I don't believe it.
Anyone there?
Anyone there?
It's rising again.
Faster and faster.
All right.
Put that mask down, please.
Yes.
You've had it. We all have.
Just consider
I'm ending your ordeal.
Come on, shit, put it down!
Then what? You'll ice me?
Like that guy?
Mom?
Yes?
Is there something after?
After?
After, when we're dead.
Do you think there's something else?
What do you think?
I don't know.
I prefer to think it doesn't end.
It's good you think that.
But do you believe in God?
Do you think he did all this?
I'm a scientist, Sarah.
In physics, we believe
every action leads to a reaction.
This mist isn't divine or magical.
It's a natural reaction to something.
OK, but what?
I don't know, angel.
Are you there?
I need to check something.
I have to go.
What's wrong?
Her battery's flat.
You need a mask.
She has 10 minutes left.
Then I'll go.
With your heart murmur
and diabetes,
you can't hold your breath 20 seconds.
But it's OK if I don't come back up.
Lucien, I appreciate it.
You're very brave.
But stay with Colette.
Mom?
Is everything OK?
Yes, fine.
I wanted to ask...
but I'm not sure.
How do you know
if you're really in love?
Are you in love, sweetheart?
I think so.
Is Noé the lucky boy?
Is that ridiculous?
Not at all. It's great.
You don't mind
we can't be like others?
Sweetheart...
Listen, this is important.
My radio battery is nearly flat.
I have to go.
But I want you to know...
It's wonderful that you're in love.
Loving your father, then having you
is the best thing that happened to me.
And I also think
more than anyone on Earth,
you have the right to be in love.
Are you OK?
I love you, my girl.
I love you more than anything.
Me too.
Thank you.
Backup system launched
Mom, the battery's dying.
The bubble's off.
What do I do if smoke gets in?
Mom!
Mom!
No mask?
Why no mask?
Mom, you have to go back up!
What're you doing?
Why don't you have a mask?
What's going on?
Why did you do this?
Go back up now!
Mom?
Are you there?
Mom?
Are you up there?
- Dad!
- What's wrong?
Mom changed the battery without a mask!
You made it.
And Anna?
Mom, are you there?
Dad?
Did you hear a cry?
Pull yourself together.
I'll talk to her.
Why don't you answer?
Answer me!
It's OK.
It's OK. I'll...
Sarah...
It's Dad.
What's happening?
An earthquake?
It's nothing.
They predicted it.
It's nothing serious.
Lucien...
The mist's rising fast.
It'll soon enter the apartment.
On a square nearby,
I saw a truck with a full army suit.
If I find it,
I can adapt it for Sarah.
And I'll find oxygen masks for you both.
There's no need, Mathieu.
Our journey ends here.
It's wiser.
Why? I'm sure I have time.
Believe me.
I don't want to survive my son.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
We've had a good life.
We're at home.
And we're still together.
Thank you, Mathieu.
Colette and I are with you.
Give her my love.
I will.
Lucien, what's happening?
- What's that?
- Nothing, my sweet.
Nothing at all,
just kids with firecrackers.
It's all right. Don't worry.
Sarah, it's me.
We need to talk.
Sarah, look at me.
Sarah...
Come on, honey.
This is important.
I'm going out.
What?
I have to go out.
You can't. What'll I do alone?
I have to fix the suit.
I don't want you to!
Calm down, honey.
You'll die like Mom!
Because of me again.
What do you mean?
Don't say that.
Mom couldn't bear it.
She decided, not you, OK.
She knew what she was doing.
Trust me.
I promise I'll be back.
You must believe me.
I'll be back
and we'll both leave this place.
Together.
All right?
I have to go.
Don't cry, honey.
I'll get you out, sweetheart.
Did you really have a good life with me?
If one thing in this world is true,
my sweet,
it's that I was the happiest of men
living with you.
Dad?
Are you there?
I can't hear you.
Dad, is that you?
Sarah, can you hear me?
I'm here.
I have the suit.
I'm on my way, honey.
I'm on my way.
Sarah, can you hear me?
I'm nearly there.
You can breathe?
Noé came for me.
The mist can't harm us.
Why is that?
I don't know.
I don't know.
What are you doing?
You're free.
- Are you OK?
- Yes.
I'm OK.
I'm OK, honey.
I told you so. I knew.
Sarah?
Yes, Dad, I'm coming.
