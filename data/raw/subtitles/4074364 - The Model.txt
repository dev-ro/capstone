- Damn, I'm going to miss you.
- Yes me too.
Look what I found.
- Do you remember?
- Yes
It is to not forget me.
Hey.
Good.
Come here.
Bye, Mom.
Well? Are you ready?
Yes.
Hi, Mom.
Hello. No, no, everything is fine.
Everything went well.
I was very satisfied.
All right.
Yes, she's very cute. I live
with a very sweet girl.
It's very nice here.
Mom, I'm busy now.
I can call you later?
We'll talk later.
It's okay.
Yes, okay. Bye.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Can you see me?
- You see me?
Yes.
What? How are you?
I'm fine. I have to
go take a shower,
It is at the end of the door,
so I do not have much time.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm just tired.
- I miss you terribly.
- Yes me too.
I looked at the price of tickets
for the autumn holidays.
It's not as expensive as I thought.
I think I could go to be with you...
a week or more?
Well... still I have
many things to do.
I'm very busy. I
move all the time
And I stay in this small
room with another girl.
There is no room for you here.
- You do not mean...
- Yes, sorry.
It wil have to be
at  another time.
So I can be in a place where
there is room for you to be.
I adapt, but still
is not the time.
- Is it you?
- Yes, it's me.
- You're very pretty.
- Thank you.
- Take it.
- What?
Take it.
- For me?
- For you.
- Thanks.
- A gift.
Thank you, goodbye.
- Hello.
- Hello.
What are you doing here?
Surprise.
What happens?
How did you do?
I worked a little.
Are not you happy?
- What do you think?
- I do not know, I guess so.
Come on, do not be like that.
I needed to see you.
- Were not you missing me?
- Yes
- You sure?
- Of course.
I missed that smell.
- No.
- What?
- Not now, Frederik.
- Why?
Zofia is right next door.
- Is that yours?
- No, the other.
Shane:  Maybe Leopard later?
There is a mag. reception tonight.
Emma, come with me.
Come with me.
Now!
- What the fuck is going on?
- It was him who he gave me a kiss.
What are you talking about?
- Who is he?
- Someone from work.
Do not lie.
Someone with whom I went out recently.
What are you telling me?
You're wrong.
Are you crazy or what?
Fuck you!
- Forgot to come?
- Of course not.
Is she your new girlfriend?
- She is ugly.
- Enough, Olivia!
You owe me five thousand crowns!
 Transfer it to my account now!!
Hi, Mom.
Yes, I was away for a few days.
I tried to call, but there
was a bad connection.
Yes, it goes well.
Yes?
You have a visitor.
Can you?
Yes.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I'm sorry, Emma.
If I had known you
were so bad there,
I would have done something.
I have to answer this.
