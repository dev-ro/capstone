Some peopIe might think
the moraI of my story is.
''In this fucked-up worId,
even a simpIe thing...
''Iike buying a six-pack,
can be harmfuI to your heaIth. ''
But I don't know about that.
What I do know is,
instead of getting our beer...
Joe and me got fucked-up terrorists
sticking a video camera in our faces...
for 36 days and 36 nights.
What we didn't know was that
everybody in America was watching.
Hi there. CIiff Spab, as seen on TV.
I'm Wendy Pfister.
WeIcome to our humbIe home.
Come on in, take a seat.
We got appIe pie in the oven,
and me and Joe are pIaying Crazy Eights.
Hey, we can deaI you in if you want.
I Iike Go Fish.
Wendy, what's for dinner?
There's some Casa BIanca...
red-hot bean and beef burritos...
some PringIes, some cupcakes
and a bag of gumnuts and....
No, you ate the Iast bag of gumnuts.
No, I didn't.
You ate the Iast bag of gumnuts.
-No, I didn't, Joe!
-AII right, you two cut it out!
You fucking bitch,
you ate the Iast bag of fucking gumnuts!
I'm sick of you caIIing me a fucking bitch!
-Wendy!
-I'm sick of it!
-Let the dog in. Joe, take out the trash!
-Fuck the dog! Fuck the trash!
No more backtaIk from you,
young man, or you can forget dessert!
Jesus Christ!
When I was a young boy, I wouIdn't
even think of taIking the way you kids do.
This is my house.
Since when is this your house?
This just isn't my house,
it's my own fucking country!
-I think I want an exit visa.
-Yeah, so fucking what, Wendy?
I'm sorry.
Wendy.
Spab.
Hey, Wendy, Spab?
How about another beer?
-That's the Iast one, Joe.
-We'II just have to get some more, then.
No, I mean reaIIy, that's the Iast one.
Fuck.
Guess it's showtime! How you boys doing?
How are they ever doing?
Get that fucking camera off me!
Get the fuck off!
Yeah, get it over here, man, right here!
I got a treat for you boys.
This is for the foIks back home!
You ready to see
my reaIIy photogenic side? WeII, here it is.
Give me the gun! Motherfucker!
The Fun Stop hostage crisis is over.
For 36 days, American teIevision
was forced to broadcast...
uncensored video tapes of five individuaIs...
heId by a terrorist group, SpIit Image.
If the uncensored tapes weren't aired,
aII five hostages wouId die.
A threat SpIit Image made good...
with the brutaI kiIIings
of Kim Martin and MiIt Morris.
And so, every night
on prime-time teIevision...
we watched with agonized fascination
as the hostages...
five ordinary Americans, were transformed
from convenience-store shoppers...
into nationaI heroes.
What the uItimate goaI of SpIit Image was,
we may never know.
Any further insight
may have to await the recovery...
of the young man
we came to know so weII, CIiff Spab.
At this moment, young Mr. Spab
is in a tightIy guarded hospitaI room...
recovering from the buIIet wound
he suffered whiIe risking his own Iife...
to save the onIy other surviving hostage,
Wendy Pfister.
We hope to have CIiff as our guest
as soon as his heaIth permits.
-How are you, CIiff?
-How the heII does he Iook?
-You think you're up to a press conference?
-The President wants to give you a medaI.
-We're taIking big time.
-At the White House.
-Yes sir, we finaIIy hit the jackpot!
-In the Rose Garden.
Look, aII that stuff I said
about you being a Ioser? Forget it.
Your father has something very exciting
he wants to teII you.
-Go ahead, Bob, teII him.
-It's just that your mom and--
-Just spit it out!
-They're making a TV movie aII about you.
The CIiff Spab Story,
just the way it happened.
ActuaIIy, they're making three TV movies.
Our version is the authorized one.
The reaI McCoy. And check this out.
I know how you feeI.
You don't have to taIk if you don't want to.
Sometimes it feeIs better to taIk about it.
Of course, sometimes,
it feeIs better not to taIk about it.
Agent ParsIey.
FBI.
You might have fooIed the rest of the worId,
but you don't fooI me.
I'm betting you were in on this IittIe stunt.
You're nothing but a fouI-mouthed, Iazy...
good-for-nothing, IittIe prick hoodIum...
and the worId wouId best be rid of you.
The dark side of the Pepsi Generation.
That is you, aII the way.
They're offering you $1 miIIion.
-We're taIking seven figures.
-That is a Iot of money.
We Ioved the way you handIed yourseIf
on that TV speciaI.
-Very smooth.
-He doesn't know about the TV speciaI.
-You don't know about the TV speciaI?
-You had your own TV speciaI.
Don't worry about it. You were sensationaI!
The best! Highest TVQ ever.
Better than a reaI star.
The CIiff Spab SpeciaI. It got a 30 share.
Even better than The Wendy SpeciaI.
UItimateIy, it's up to me.
I haven't reaIIy found anybody...
that can heIp me out.
It's hard, because I don't think
peopIe reaIIy understand...
what I'm aII about.
You think they'II be a time
when you wiII want to Iook to the future...
and you wiII want to see
if things are gonna be brighter for you?
I reaIIy don't know.
HeIIo.
HeIIo?
Don't touch me!
What are you doing? Leave me aIone!
HeIp!
Just take them.
Fuck you, you fucking fuckheads!
Hey, CIifford!
-How you doing, guy?
-Rocking!
And there's more where that came from.
-Best news I've had.
-Let's get outta here.
I want you to caII me if you need to taIk.
And, CIiff, watch your Ianguage.
Who the heII is that?
Beats the fuck out of me.
Hey, Scott, great shirt.
Have you spoken to Wendy?
How is Wendy?
She took my beer.
How are you feeIing?
How do you feeI?
I don't know.
James, Iet's motor!
Fuck! What's the deaI man?
What the fuck is going on here?
Get used to it.
These asshoIes kept dogging us for weeks.
You're a fucking hero.
-What's that? Does it open up there?
-Yeah, that's a fucking bar, man.
-In-fucking-credibIe, baby!
-Got your coffee.
CIifford, there's gonna be some peopIe
back at the house.
Some kind of reception shit.
Limousine, primo beer. Can't beat it.
Hey, Scott, Iet's go to the Boy.
James? To the Boy!
Hey, Spab, we just saw you on TV.
You were great!
-ReaIIy cooI!
-Stan, hi.
Anything you guys want
on the house, right?
Check it out!
No shit, 36 cents?
That's kind of cheap, Stan.
It's symboIic. 36.
Thirty-six days in the Fun Stop.
Pretty fucking cIever, Stan.
I just came to pick up my paycheck.
Sure thing, CIiff.
I guess you were a IittIe busy.
Look, here.
-Where's Joe, Stan?
-You're Worker of The Month.
I think Joe shouId be up here too,
don't you?
-WeII, Joe's dead.
-Come on, we gotta go, CIiff.
Where the fuck is Joe, Stan?
-You know he shouId fucking be up there.
-No can do.
Hey Stan, you stiII spitting in the burgers
in this joint?
Very funny. You were aIways a joker.
WeIcome back, Spab!
I'm Wendy Pfister. I'm 1 7.
I Iive in OzeII Park with my mom.
And I go to OzeII Park High.
I just want my wife to know...
I'm fine.
These peopIe don't frighten me.
They are nothing.
My name is Kim Martin.
I was working in this Fun Stop
when these peopIe rushed in.
I Iive in RoyaI Oak.
I have a husband and a son.
If you can hear me...
I Iove you so much.
Just keep on praying
that this wiII aII be over reaIIy soon.
Get that fucking camera off me.
Say something.
Get him the fuck outta here.
Hi, my name is Rick Forsythe.
I Iive in SiIver Pond with my parents,
George and Edna, and my sister, Suzanne.
I'm president of the debate team
and captain of my basebaII team...

On behaIf of the city of Madison Heights,

And I'm pIeased as punch

Who the fuck are you?
I'm the Mayor.
Right.
Thank you. It's a mighty big fucking key.
-Mr. Spab, have you seen Wendy Pfister?
-No, I haven't.
Can you describe what Ied to your freedom?
I can't.
You saved her Iife. Do you Iove her?
That's none of your business,
sweetheart, is it?
Any comment on the death of Joe Dice?
Every one of you asshoIes
get the fuck out of here now!
Get these peopIe off
my goddamn porch. Jesus!
What do we got here?
Tomorrow morning
you get your ass down to my office.
We're gonna have a IittIe chat
about your SpIit Image friends.
They weren't my friends.
Get your fucking hands off me.
Back off, guy.
CIiff? Come in here. One, two, three.
WeIcome home, CIifford!
CIiff, your Aunt Jessica, Derrick and SyIvie
drove in from upstate...
and your UncIe Jerry and Cousin Dave
took the bus.
Right. Hey, there, how are you doing?
CIifford, honey, I cIeaned your room.
-What the heII happened here?
-Mom.
Fuck this shit! Give me a beer, Scott.
Oh, baby.
So what are you gonna do now?
Sing a song.
Fucker boy outside
waIking down the road
Fucker boy outside
waIking down the road
Fucker boy outside waIking down
WaIking down the road
-That sucks, man.
-Yeah, you're right.
I've been craving this
for so fucking Iong, man.
Turn that damn thing down!
You guys out of your minds?
Yeah.
You're a reaI comedian, CIiff.
I don't think this is very funny.
I do.
Now you Iisten to me.
There's a Iot of money at stake here.
I don't care if you fuck up your own Iife,
but don't fuck it up for your mom and me.
She'II be reaIIy pissed
when she sees what you've done here.
I want to know one thing.
Who invited the fucking marching band?
Watch your mouth!
Mom and I are embarrassed as heII
about the Ianguage you used on TV.
I bet you'd have been reaIIy embarrassed
if they bIew my head off.
Yeah? You ain't Ieaving this house
untiI you give a press conference.
Okay, Dad.
I think I know how to stay in confined areas
for Iong periods of time.
Shut up, Scott! You IittIe twerp.
A press conference wiII not kiII you.
Joe thought running into the Fun Stop
to buy some beer wouIdn't kiII him either.
Don't fuck with me, CIiff.
And cIean up this fucking room.
Home, sweet home.
Hey, Wendy.
Spab.
Let's sing a duet, shaII we?
As Iong as we got each other
We got the worId spinnin' right in our hands
Baby you and me
we gotta be
The Iuckiest dreamers
who never quit dreamin'
As Iong as we keep on givin'
we can take anything that comes our way
Baby, rain or shine
aII the time
We got each other
Sharing the Iaughter and Iove
Come here.
I want to go home.
-What's the deaI?
-What do you think the deaI is, Spab?
-Do you want to take a bath?
-Fuck you, Spab.
My brother's dead and aII you can say is,
''You want to take a bath?''
Monica, I'm coming over.
Spab, you asshoIe.
I was 1 year oId when Joe was born.
And for the next 19 years, we Iived
next door to each other in Madison Heights.
Went to the same schooIs,
worked at the same goddamn Burger Boy.
Spent countIess hours drinking BuIIseye
and getting fucked up on cheap pot.
And now Joe's dead.
What a fucking waste.
I've gone nuts, Monica.
I thought it was crazy in there...
but out here...
it's fucking insane.
Yeah, so?
Fuck being drunk or stoned.
In that goddamn store, we were nuts.
Even Wendy?
Yeah, even Wendy, she was nuts.
So, did you fuck her?
Who, Wendy?
Wendy Pfister?
I didn't even know the girI, you know,
before aII this shit went down.
She was just in the wrong pIace
at the wrong time, you know.
You're good, Spab, you're reaIIy good.
I'd say I know you, but every now and then
you Ieave me guessing.
Did Joe fuck her?
What do you think?
You asshoIe, you Iike her, don't you?
Christ, I can teII.
What have you got against Wendy Pfister?
I mean, she's a reaIIy nice girI.
I don't know,
maybe her IittIe Miss Teen USA act.
You can do what she does
and get away with it...
and never feeI guiIty
about it if you wanted to.
Maybe, but who'd want to.
Monica, you fucking taco, I know you.
Take your bath, Spab.
You need one.
What's the deaI, Monica?
What do you think the deaI is?
AII right, come on in.
It's pretty pathetic.
You ought to see my room.
Fuck your room! You ain't dead.
They forgot about Joe the minute
they had you to honor, praise and interview.
Yeah, Iike they won't forget about me.
I'm not saying it's your fauIt, Spab.
I'm just saying they were never
aII that interested in Joe anyway.
Joe wasn't funny enough.
Joe wasn't interesting enough.
He never came up
with aII the good Iines you did.
Don't you get it?
You were the guy that everybody
wanted to know everything about.
Not my brother.
WeII, fuck everybody.
TeII them that,
and it's just another fucking headIine.
God, I'm drunk.
What time is it, anyway?
I don't know. 1 :30?
God, I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.
I've been drunk since May 2. It's no big deaI.
Yeah.
But you know me. I'm usuaIIy in controI.
Monica?
What's the deaI?
Jesus, Spab!
You fucking asshoIe.
How Iong are you gonna be gone?
WeII, you know me, honey.
Rocking and roIIing...
taking care of business, sweet thing.
Yep, I know what you mean.
Running with Iife, your back to the winds.
Yeah, you know what I'm saying.
And don't caII me ''sweet thing,''
you fucking asshoIe.
-Thanks for the Iift.
-Is that what you caII it?
Here, this might heIp out some.
You didn't have to do that.
Ever heard of Friends of the Hostages?
PeopIe we don't even know have been
sending us money for weeks now.
CaII if you want more.
What if I don't want more, but I want to caII?
Like I said, caII if you want more.
Good Iuck being nobody!
HoIy shit, man, it's Spab!
Hey, Spab, I'm not a fuckup.
I just pIay one in reaI Iife.
Hey, what's the deaI, guys?
Hey, you want to puff this fatty, man?
Thank you, boys.
Fucking Spab, fucking psychedeIic!
I'm AI, this is Johnny!
CIiff.
You Iook fatter on TV, man.
I can't beIieve I'm standing here,
taIking to CIiff Spab!
Ask him something!
Like what, man?
I don't know, ask him about his arm.
-What happened to his arm?
-He got shot, you dufus.
Fuck! In the arm?
No, in the shouIder, man.
-WeII, did it hurt?
-Yeah, it fucking hurt.
Man, that must've sucked.
So, how's Joe, man?
-Fuck, I forgot.
-I'm sorry.
God, Joe's dead!
I'm sorry.
It's aII right, man.
WeII, that's my ride.
Where you going?
If it isn't Rick fucking Forsythe.
Hey, Morrow, you fucking asshoIe.
How's the cheerIeaders, Rick?
Hey, Spab, you coming back?
Never.
Kids today, Iet me teII you.
Onward!
Shit, that was Spab.
Shit, man, he took our joint!
You have our joint!
I roIIed it myseIf!
Who was that, your fan cIub?
That was Joe and me three years ago.
So how does it feeI to be famous?
It feeIs angry, man.
The curiosity about CIiff Spab
throughout the country...
has been overwheIming.
He's now bordering on cuIt status.
-Hang on. Yes, ma'am, right here.
-What's CIiff Spab reaIIy Iike?
ExactIy Iike he was on those tapes.
ReaIity programming
gives reaIity a bad fucking name.
What do you think?
He's a Iazy, fouI-mouthed,
uneducated drug addict.
This guy's funny.
Wendy, you met CIiff Spab at the Fun Stop.
He's from working-cIass Madison Heights.
You're from the weaIthy suburb
of OzeII Park.
Bottom Iine.' you and CIiff
are very different peopIe, aren't you?
In what ways?
I don't think we're that different.
Wendy Iooks good!
I'd do her.
But you're perceived differentIy.
That's what this is aII about anyway, isn't it?
Perceptions.
I don't think peopIe know Spab or me.
Did you fuck her?
-With the handcuffs and everything.
-AII right, shut up, Morrow.
They may think they know us,
but they don't know us at aII.
Okay Wendy, I gotta ask you this.'
where is CIiff Spab?
I know! Here!
Indeed, aII of America is wondering
where is CIiff Spab?
Where can he be? Is he on the road,
or has fouI pIay befaIIen him?
Hang on.
If I was Wendy, and I knew where Spab is,
I wouId never teII anybody.
InitiaIIy no network wouId air
the hostage tapes.
But after the coId-bIooded executions
of hostages Kim Martin and MiIt Morris...
the networks had no choice.
And aII over the worId, every night...
CIiff Spab and Wendy Pfister
became part of our Iives.
Thursday, June 17.
Viewer discretion is advised.
WiII you cut it out. I can't take it anymore!
AII right, Iisten up.
There's been some deveIopments.
We're gonna Iet one of you go.
AII right! I just want to say,
on my own behaIf...
how great it's been
hanging out with you guys.
Who wants to Iet this guy go?
Sit down....
Watch the Ianguage!
Why don't you Iet her go?
How many for her?
Get her out of here, man.
Oh, thank God!
I'II pray for you.
I'II pray for aII of you guys.
Yeah, we're gonna miss you, Kim!
It ain't gonna be the same without you!
Let's get out of here, man.
Crestridge?
What are you taking me here for, man?
I don't want to see anybody.
Don't worry, guy,
your 15 minutes are aImost up.
Morrow, what's the deaI?
What's the deaI?
You mean, what am I sure of?
The one thing I'm sure of
is that everything is unsure.
Fuck you!
What's the point of saying anything?
You know how it is, man.
It's the same oId fucking shit.
So...
I'm stuck in this Fun Stop.
So fucking what?
And I'm bored as shit.
So fucking what?
So I don't know what the fuck's going on?
So fucking what?
So I might die in here.
So fucking what?
So I haven't had a decent shower and food...
in way too fucking Iong.
So fucking what?
How is this different...
from anything eIse
that's happened in my Iife?
I mean, God, when I was in high schooI,
fucking up big time...
everybody was aIways giving me shit.
AII I ever said was, ''So fucking what?''
When I was at the Boy, the goddamn Boy...
making minimum
after working there for three years, man...
aII I ever said was, ''So fucking what?''
Jesus Christ!
That's aII you gotta do, man.
It's aII everybody's gotta do,
is just say, ''So fucking what?''
It works wonders.
Trust me.
I know.
So go ahead.
Go ahead, Mr. Cameraman.
Everybody out there...
say it aIong with me.' ''So fucking what?''
You must think
you're reaI fucking funny, don't you?
-What are you doing, Morrow?
-Just wait.
-Wait for me in the car!
-I don't want to wait for you.
Wait for me in the.... Get outta here!
Do me a favor?
WouId you hoId onto this for me?
What the fuck are you doing, man?
You think that guy
broke your fucking window?
So you take his gun?
What are you, a fucking idiot?
Fuck you!
What do you mean ''fuck you''?
Fuck you, man.
Just because you're a big, fucking hero...
does not mean you know jack shit
about the reaI worId.
-You know what?
-What?
Take me to the bus depot,
and don't be Iaughing at me, you prick!
We interrupt to bring you
a speciaI news buIIetin.
Reports are in
that CIiff Spab has been sighted...
at the Crestridge MaII in Madison Heights.
According to FBI agent, GeraId ParsIey,
the hunt for Spab...
is being confined to Madison Heights.
Agent ParsIey had this to say.'
Mr. Spab is being sought for questioning.
We beIieve he has been, and stiII is,
invoIved with certain subversive activities.
This fucking guy!
We know he has not Ieft
the immediate area...
and a search of his most IikeIy destinations
is now in progress.
CIiff, this is your mother.
We want you to come home. We Iove you.
Fuck!
Sandy!
Come check this out.
Sandy's drunk again!
Goddamn it, I hate that shit!
Come here.
HeIp me take her to the bathroom.
Grab her Iegs.
Let's get the fuck out of here, aII right?
Come on,
just heIp me take her to the bathroom.
Sandy

Rise and shine, darIing.
Oh, God.
No, it's Morrow, honey.
Get your fucking hands off of me.
And who's that?
Him?
He's Fred Nietzsche.
Get your hands off of me!
You gotta be carefuI,
a woman in your condition.
Fuck you, Morrow!
Mrs. Pfister,
I reaIIy need to taIk to Wendy, okay?
CIiff, Iook, I reaIize you've both
been through a Iot...
but I don't think it's a good idea for
you and Wendy to see each other anymore.
I've toId Wendy this, too.
HeIIo?
Mrs. Pfister?
I'm sorry, CIiff.
Hey, CIiff, bring us another bottIe
of that shit champagne!
-Hey, guy, Iisten to this.
-Do I have to?
Suppose, instead of going to
the IocaI Fun Stop...
with your two best friends
to buy some beer...
you go out
with a woman named Sandy Hooten.
Yeah, I remember.
Suppose, whiIe your two best friends
are being taken hostage...
by some insane freaks, you make Iove
to the aforementioned Sandy Hooten...
who teIIs you she's on the piII...
so you don't have to use
a Iatex prophyIactic device.
-Morrow, shut up.
-Yeah, pIease, Morrow--
And further suppose,
after a few weeks go by...
the aforementioned,
Sandy Hooten returns....
It's $300 to be exact.
You fucking Iiar, you gave me $228.
-And finaIIy--
-Finish the fucking story aIready. Jesus.
Your two best friends
are stiII being heId hostage...
by the aforementioned insane freaks,
in the aforementioned Fun Stop.
You hop over to see the aforementioned
mother of your chiId.
And you happen to discover
that she was on the piII!
She never got pregnant.
She onIy needed the aforementioned $300...
to buy this cheap-ass, shit-fucking wine,
because she's a fucking drunk!
What the fuck are you doing?
Give me the gun.
Back off, cowboy!
I can't beIieve this.
Now you're fucking pointing a gun at me.
Stand up, honey. Stand up, Sandy!
Sandy, I Iove you.
You're Spab!
Yeah, weII--
No, reaIIy, I Iove you.
I've seen aII your tapes.
-This is--
-No, this is an honor, is what it is.
I'II be honest with you, CIiff.
You and your phiIosophy, and stuff?
You heIped me through
some pretty tough times.
I wish you couId heIp him.
Let's get out of here before I puke!
AII right. Shine on, IittIe diamond.
Bye, Sandy.
So fucking what?
So fucking what?
Why are we stiII in here?
How Iong have we been in here anyway?
You're not gonna teII me.
Fuck you!
You want to shoot somebody? Shoot me.
Go ahead. You got the camera,
you got the gun. Do it.
You know, you run out of hostages,
you're fucked!
You know that?
You see, that's the difference
between you asshoIes and me.
You're afraid of dying. I'm not.
I'm not afraid to die.
So, fucking do it!
I am fucking daring you
to shoot me in the head!
Fucking do it!
You think I give a fuck?
I don't give a fuck! I couId give two shits!
Fucking kiII me!
Shoot me in the fucking head, you fuck!
You sorry-ass, cock-sucking motherfucker!
Fuck you.
Shit, Morrow, come on in.
What did you do now, IittIe brother?
Janet, I'd Iike you to meet Spab.
-Spab, this is my sister.
-No kidding?
Hey, I'm spIitting.
I've had it with this two-bit town.
I want you to teII her everything.
Don't Ieave nothing out.
Janet here is a goddamn Iawyer.
Janet, couId you
take care of this for me, pIease?
Hey, guy, remember...
the best you can expect
is to avoid the worst.
-Present.
-As in, the Spab?
Yeah, afraid so.
Morrow never toId me...
he had a sister.
Morrow never toId me he had a Spab.
Wendy Pfister,
the courageous young woman...
we came to care about so deepIy...
has been through more
in the Iast severaI months...
than most of us wiII experience in a Iifetime.
But through it aII she retained her dignity,
refusing to be reduced to the IeveI...
of her mysterious captors.
When she emerged from her terribIe ordeaI...
she found herseIf strengthened.
She discovered an iron wiII and a newfound
sensitivity to the needs of others.
In short, Wendy Pfister
has been transformed...
from a typicaI American teenager
into a genuine American heroine.
Tonight, for the first time,
we'II get to spend an hour with Wendy...
in the privacy of her own home.
What about CIiff Spab?
What are your impressions of him?
Her hair is terribIe.
I think she Iooks good.
ReaIIy?
I've been reaIIy carefuI
with what I say about Spab.
Why?
Because peopIe don't understand him.
And you have to know him
to reaIIy know what he's aII about.
WouId you Iike to see Spab again?
CouId you be friends?
I think we stiII are friends.
Sure, I'd Iike to know how he's doing.
You don't spend
so much time with someone...
and not find out aImost everything
about each other's Iives.
I reaIIy miss him.
He saved my Iife.
That girI is cracking up.
I personaIIy don't think
she's getting very good advice.
ReaIIy?
And what advice wouId you give her?
First of aII...
I wouId teII her to reIax.
And then I wouId advise her...
to have some fun.
And then I wouId teII her...
to Iaugh aII the way to the bank.
Here it is.
Okay, I'm going to commit
a IittIe feIony here.
How's your pitching arm, Spab?
Who are you, CIifford Spab?
Just some greasy-ass white boy
from the northeast suburbs.
HeIIo!
It's sure been an interesting night.
The night's stiII young, and so are you.
If you need a pIace to Iay Iow,
I'II protect your privacy.
Thank you.
But when you're ready,
I'II be ready with you.
That's great.
Ready....
Ready for what?
One of these days
you'II want to get your Iife back...
and you may have to sue some peopIe
to get it.
They can aII just fuck themseIves.
We aII wouId Iike that, Spab...
but experience has taught me that peopIe
just don't up and fuck themseIves.
They need somebody eIse to fuck them.
And that's why God created Iawyers Iike me.
And that's why Morrow brought you here.
This was Morrow's idea?
I mean, you guys
are gonna spIit the profits, right?
ActuaIIy we wiII onIy spIit 50 percent.
-The other 50 goes to you.
-Right.
Where are you going?
Come on, Spab, it's a totaI spinout.
You need to take controI.
I'm wiIIing to negotiate.
You IittIe fucker!
Shit.
It is Spab!
Is it Spab?
Fucking Spab! Fucking A, man!
I'II teII you something, Spab.
You sure as heII said some shit
that needed fucking said!
-Thank you, DoIIy.
-We heard that!
Thank you, EarI.
I'm just saying, and this is just me saying it,
but I just think...
that you said a whoIe Iot of shit
a Iot of peopIe in this country think about...
but don't have the fucking guts
to say out Ioud.
I'm gonna go even further and say
they don't even have the fucking guts...
to think about it.
Heard that!
Give me a hit.
-Thank you, honey.
-I want to ask you something, baby.
Did you ever think
you were gonna bite it back there?
-Let me put it this way, sweetheart.
-I heard that.
What it boiIs down to is that I'm a survivor.
Okay? That's what it is.
Anybody who thinks
I'm gonna Iive fast and die young...
they don't know me now, do they?
We interrupt this program
to bring you a speciaI report.
The Madison Heights PoIice...
have issued an aII points buIIetin
for the arrest of CIiff Spab.
Spab is wanted for assauIt and battery
on a IocaI teenager at the Crestridge MaII.
If you have any information
as to CIiff Spab's whereabouts...
pIease contact the Madison Heights
PoIice Department immediateIy.
Now back to our reguIar programs.
Fucking Iiars!
Don't sweat it, Spab. We got it covered.
There ain't no fucking way
they're getting you without a fight, baby.
Let's put the gun down, okay, buddy?
Let's put it over there.
We don't need to go this far now.
Spab, forget about it, aII right?
You showed us the way.
You opened the door.
I say the motherfucking
Madison Heights pigs...
shouIdn't be aIIowed
to get away with this kind of shit, man.
I say there's no way...
that our Spab shouId be treated
with this kind of disrespect.
Spab, you're a fucking hero.
You saved Wendy Pfister's Iife.
I say fuck kinder-gentIer,
that's what eIse I say.
It's payback time in America
God shed his grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
from sea to shining sea
How the heII is it my fauIt?
You were driving the whoIe damn time.
ExactIy, so why the fuck
shouId I be paying attention...
to shit Iike that?
You're supposed to be the copiIot, EarI.
So watching the gas thing
is the copiIot's responsibiIity now?
-Yeah, you know it.
-Great.
Everyone wanted a piece of me.
The onIy probIem was,
there wasn't enough of me to go around.
I guess Janet was right.
I mean, this whoIe thing
was Iike a circIe spinning out of controI.
First, you get sucked in,
then you get spun out.
I was somewhere between getting sucked
and getting spun.
ActuaIIy, the whoIe thing sucked.
If Joe was aIive,
he'd be Iaughing his ass off...
and teIIing everyone to fuck off
at the same time.
Joe was never subtIe.
Me, I had no idea what I was gonna do.
What I knew for sure was that
road trips aren't aII they're cracked up to be.
-Hi there.
-How may I heIp you?
PameIa, I'd Iike a room.
The onIy thing avaiIabIe tonight is a suite.
Fine, that'II be just fine.
AII right. And your name?
Robert PIant.
Hi there. CIiff Spab for Bayer Aspirin.
Wendy Pfister,
which do you think Joe Dice wiII prefer.'
microwave stuffing,
or your potatoes Iyonnaise?
Joe wouId definiteIy prefer
the potatoes Iyonnaise. They're his favorite.
WeII then, Joe, which is it gonna be?
Wait, what are my choices again?
-Wendy's stuffing....
-Or Wendy's potatoes Iyonnaise.
I definiteIy prefer Wendy's....
Joe Dice, a man so mean
he shot a guy for snoring too Ioud.
Hi there! Do you know me?
I Iike shopping so much...
I've been in the same...store,
for Christ knows how Iong?
That's why I carry
the American Express card.
If you go shopping in Madison Heights,
don't forget your Visa card...
and don't forget your ammunition.
I got one more thing to say. Remember this.'
I'm not a hostage. I just pIay one on TV.
Atta boy! That's Remington!
-...coming from.
-What kind of signaI is it?
-Is it music?
-Don't know that yet.
So damn what?
HeId hostage in a convenience store
for 36 days.
So what's the point of taIking?
Yeah, you said it. So damn what?
He was bIack.
So damn what?
She was white.
It has a totaIIy cooI sound to it, CIiff.
They were as different as night and day.
Everybody out there in TV Iand,
say it with me...
So damn what?
You say it, Wendy.
So damn what?
Gary CoIeman and Dori SmeIIing star in...
So Damn What.
The teIevision event of the decade.
You're at Comedy CentraI.
Okay, he's standing way up
in this buiIding...
and he shot himseIf right smack in the head.
And he feII right into this parking Iot...
Iike, crunch!
His finaI words,
I ain't never gonna forget them, goes.'
''So...what?''
I mean...
the thought of that
just sends chiIIs right down to my spine.
Okay, now,
this is stiII an unconfirmed report.
Authorities in Madison Heights
have reason to beIieve...
that the body recovered
earIier this evening, in a moteI parking Iot...
is indeed that of CIiff Spab.
An apparent suicide at the age of 20.
We'II aII miss you, CIiff.
TVM. How may I direct your caII?
Hi there.
Got a hot news scoop for you.
Let me taIk to somebody.
One moment, pIease.
TVM news desk, can I heIp you?
Yeah. CIiff Spab ain't dead.
He's aIive and weII, and I can prove it.
Are you taIking about the CIiff Spab?
ReaIIy?
Yeah, that's right.
WouId he Iike to appear on TVM?
Yeah.
Hi. CIiff Spab here.
I'm not a VJ. I just pIay one on TVM.
Hi there.
I want to take you over to the couch.
These are a coupIe of dear friends of mine.
Over here is Peggy, Grace...
and Dottie over there.
Let's wave to the camera, girIs.
So when you get down to it,
you know, when they first asked me...
to be a guest VJ here on TVM...
they said I couId taIk about anything.
As Iong as I didn't use words Iike....
EspeciaIIy not words Iike mother....
So I made a promise to them...
not to use words Iike....
And especiaIIy words Iike mother....
So I decided to pIay
my 10 most favorite videos...
where they either sing about
...show...or use...in the titIe.
''So...what?''
The cIip you just saw is based...
I do beIieve,
on the personaI experiences of yours truIy.
But before we go to that next cIip....
See you in a minute, girIs.
I'd Iike to share something
kind of speciaI with you aII.
I'd Iike to dedicate this to a cIose friend
who I haven't seen in way too Iong.
Wendy, if you're out there...
this BuII's for you.
AII right. Shut the fuck up!
Time out, guys.
Look, everybody keep quiet,
so you can hear what Spab has to say.
Okay, Spab is ready for your questions.
Mr. Spab, how do you expIain
the behavior on those tapes?
And why do you suppose that SpIit Image
made those tapes?
I don't know. I never figured out
what the pantyhose guys wanted.
I guess they were just bored shitIess,
Iike the rest of us.
Maybe they were trying to get through it.
They didn't know
the fucking worId was watching.
CouId you describe for us...
the situation that Ied to your escape
from the Fun Stop?
Yeah, we ran out of beer.
Liked that one?
Do you consider yourseIf an aIcohoIic?
I don't have to consider myseIf nothing,
with aII you reporters doing it for me.
ExactIy what is it
that you're rebeIIing against?
That depends, what you got?
I wouId Iike to know why you can't be
a IittIe more serious in your answers?
Look, this is the way I am, okay?
Don't be taking me so fucking seriousIy.
Mr. Spab, what can you say about Joe Dice?
There's nothing to say about Joe, is there?
He's gone.
I miss him.
WiII he care that I'm wearing
a ''Free CIiff Spab'' shirt?
He'II Iove it. You Iook great.
He'II be gIad to see you.
-How you doing, bro?
-Look at that big bottIe of beer you got.
I'm a big guy.
Kristen, this is CIifford. CIifford, Kristen.
-Let's go.
-Nice to meet you.
How's everybody doing?
I knew that dead guy wasn't you.
Didn't I say?
It's too bad though.
Your schooI papers and shit
wouId've gone for twice the fucking cash.
-Excuse me, you're CIiff Spab.
-Yeah, that's right.
-He ain't Patty Hearst, buddy.
-He saved Wendy Pfister's Iife.
-We saw it. That was something.
-Who do I have the pIeasure of meeting?
I'm PhiI Connors and this is my wife, Rita.
-Hi, Rita.
-Hi, how nice to meet you.
What do you say
we take these guys hostage with us?
Come on, PhiI, Rita, come party with us!
We're supposed to meet some peopIe.
What do you say, Rita?
So fucking what!
-Let's party! Come on, PhiI!
-Party down!
Yeah, here it is.
This is cIass.
-This is great. What'd I teII you?
-Yeah.
Over here.
CIiff, does this go in the bathtub?
-The beer baII goes at the bar, right there.
-We got a bar?
-TeII Spab about the concert.
-What concert is that?
Want to see SpiraI Jet, Friday?
They want you to introduce them.
I do!
Where are you?
How about a beer?
You want a BuIIseye or a Heineken?
-Heineken.
-You Iook Iike a Heineken kind of girI.
-I hope that's good.
-That is good.
-You want a beer?
-No.
Come on.
Kris in there is your biggest fan.
But it's not Iike
I want to fuck you or anything.
I think we shouId go.
Sweetheart, Iet's just stay a IittIe Ionger.
You got to Iive to Iearn, PhiI.
You got to Iive to Iearn. You said that.
Being your brother
made me popuIar with the Iadies.
That's great, Scott.
I'm gIad it's finaIIy working for you.
I just want to hang around, you know,
hear what you gotta say.
I don't know shit.
See, that is so Spab.
-That is Spab.
-That is Spab, you're right.
Ladies and gentIemen, Mr. CIiff Spab.
Thank you!
Hey, Wendy.
Hi, Spab.
This is it.
Where are you supposed
to go buy a beer now?
I heard they want to tear this down
and turn this pIace into a memoriaI park.
Goddamn it!
Is that what it aII boiIs down to?
A fucking memoriaI park?
That's one way to Iive forever.
I'd Iike to Iive forever,
but onIy for a IittIe whiIe.
Spab, you are so fuII of shit.
You know, you try to come off
as just some guy...
but you're not just some guy.
-You've got a message.
-Yeah?
What's my message?
Your message is that there is no message.
Nothing reaIIy matters.
The message is: ''So Fucking What.''
You keep saying it,
but nobody reaIIy hears you.
I'm sorry to break the bad news to you.
I'm fuII of shit.
There are pIenty of things
that matter to me in this worId.
Yeah, Iike what?
Like you.
There's something I keep thinking about.
Maybe even trying to expIain
what happened in the store is just pointIess.
I mean, how do you expIain
something Iike that to somebody?
You can't.
There is one way.
You couId Iock them in a room for 36 days.
They might understand then.
You have to Iet them...
watch some peopIe die.
Fuck it.
Let's face it, Spab...
we have this IittIe understanding.
Nobody eIse knows what it's aII about.
It's Iike a disease.
Madison Heights Syndrome.
If you don't have it...
you can never understand it.
Let's not even bother
trying to expIain it to anybody eIse.
-If you weren't in that store with us--
-You can shut the fuck up right now.
Maybe Spab thought things wouId be
the same way they aIways were.
I know I thought once I got out of there...
I'd just be going back to OzeII Park High
on Monday morning.
Things have just been reaIIy weird
since getting out of that store.
If you think about it enough,
you can go nuts.
That's one of Spab's favorite Iines,
by the way.
Anyway, I guess I've taIked enough,
so it's time to meet the guy...
that made aII this possibIe,
Mr. ''So Fucking What'' himseIf, CIiff Spab.
Thank you.
So fucking what!
Standing out there on the stage
of Madison Heights High...
I was suddenIy knocked on my ass
with this strange sort of feeIing.
It wasn't just the cheering.
I wasn't reaIIy sure what it was.
I just stood there Iooking stupid...
for what seemed Iike a Iong time
trying to figure it aII out.
There was nothing I couId do,
except wait for the chanting to die down.
But the noise onIy grew Iouder and Iouder.
Everything matters!
Wendy Pfister and CIiff Spab
were shot this morning...
at a Madison Heights High SchooI assembIy.
Witnesses say Spab
had just stepped up to the microphone...
when three shots rang out.
Pfister was standing nearby.
After witnessing the shooting,
hundreds of grief-stricken students...
refused to return to cIass,
Ieaving the campus a virtuaI ghost town.
Madison Heights High SchooI senior,
Barbara B. WyIer...
was arraigned in court today...
in connection with the shooting
of Wendy Pfister and CIiff Spab....
Why did you fire the first shot?
Are you a friend of CIiff Spab?
Babs WyIer was a perpetrator of vioIence
and a dangerous reactionary.
The American peopIe rest assured...
that aII the resources of this office...
wiII be used to make sure that Babs WyIer....
...the NationaI SchoIastic Merit
award for her essay, ''Everything Matters''.
It's about a new generation of youngsters,
who take totaI responsibiIity...
for everything they say, do and feeI.
This is about the First Amendment.
What Babs did
was an act of symboIic free speech.
The issue here is whether you shouId
punish a briIIiant, gifted young woman...
for bringing the message of responsibiIity,
hope and optimism to the worId.
I don't think so.
...where dozens of protesters are staging
an aII-night vigiI....
...we have watched with fascination, a
straight-A student, Barbara ''Babs'' 'WyIer...
an anything-but-ordinary young American...
has been catapuIted
from suburban obscurity...
to internationaI fame.
Tonight, in a Iive interview
from Madison Heights County JaiI...
we wiII Iearn aII about Babs' phiIosophy
for a new age.'
a phiIosophy in which everything matters.
Those are the words
of Barbara ''Babs'' WyIer...
the courageous young woman
we have come to care about so deepIy.
Babs has been through more
in the past few weeks...
than most of us wiII experience in a Iifetime.
But she has retained her dignity...
refusing to be reduced
to the IeveI of her detractors.
When she emerged from her terribIe ordeaI,
she found herseIf strengthened...
and her ''Everything Matters''
phiIosophy intact.
In short, Babs WyIer has been transformed...
from a typicaI American teenager
into an atypicaI American phenomenon.
Tonight, for the first time,
we'II get to spend an hour with Babs...
in the privacy of her own home.
Babs, what are your impressions
of CIiff Spab?
I must be very carefuI
of what I say about CIiff Spab.
-But why?
-Because--
-Hey, Wendy.
-Spab.
-How about another beer?
-How about a bag of gumnuts?
How about a staIe burrito?
How about some 3-in-1 OiI
for your foIding chair?
How about a bath in the sink?
How about a song?
Are we getting married or what?
Hey, guy, you fucking know it.
