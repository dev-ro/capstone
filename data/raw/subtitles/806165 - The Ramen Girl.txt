Oh.
Oh, thank you so much.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
[Man speaking Japanese over P.A.]
[Assertive dance music]
I got my red dress on
and my high heels too.
A pleasure that's forbidden.
Hey, Ethan.
Hey, you.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I got all turned around
at the station.
No worries.
Abby this is Mio, Jin, Asami.
Nice to meet you.
Hey, you want to get a drink?
Hell yeah.
Bye-bye.
Hey.
Um, I'll be right back,
business.
Hi, I'm Abby.
Yeah, figured.
Charlie.
So you guys know Ethan?
Who doesn't, sugar?
Gretchen.
You sound like
you're from the South.
Oh, no, I just like
to talk this way.
So, Abby, fresh off the plane, I hear.
Two weeks, actually.
It's wild.
I never thought
I'd end up in Tokyo.
But Ethan's work is here,
and I just couldn't stand
the whole long-distance relationship,
you know?
Abby, need work?
Oh, no, thanks.
I'm all set.
I got this job as a copy editor
at a Japanese law firm.
Poor drone.
How prestigious.
Please, it's a joke.
They barely give me
anything to do.
So what do you guys do?
I drink, and Gretchen's a geisha.
I'm not a geisha;
I'm a goddess.
She's a hooker.
I'm a hostess, okay?
What's that?
I get paid to look good
and entertain businessmen.
Here you go.
Cheers.
Welcome to Japan.
Thanks.
Another endless evening
chasing shadows in the darkness
Impossible to silence
Have to face myself alone
I want love
I can't resist you
I cannot lose what I'm not gonna have
Night driving on a motorway
Aren't you glad I'm here?
So what's going on?
Got a new client.
Got to go to Osaka.
They need their website up and running
as of yesterday, so...
So?
How about I come with you?
Don't you have to work?
I hate my stupid job.
You'll work,
and I'll be the tourist.
Come on, we could?
We could just play
all weekend long.
It's gonna be nonstop,
24-7, babe.
I'm not gonna have any time
to hang out at all.
Well, when are you
coming back?
I'm not sure.
You know?
It could be a while.
As in a week a while?
Ethan?
You know how you asked me last night
if I was glad you came?
Yeah.
Well, I really wanted
to say yes,
but I couldn't.
And that's messed up,
you know?
It's just gotten really intense
with you moving to Tokyo.
And you got to admit,
it happened really fast.
What do you mean?
We talked about this.
No, we didn't talk about it.
You just called
and said you were coming.
You said you wanted me
to come.
No, no, I never said that,
Abby.
Yes, you did.
I know I never said that.
Yes, you did.
Abby, I'm just not feeling it.
So now I'm gonna do
what I need to do, okay?
I got to go.
So you're not coming back, then?
I never said that.
This is crazy.
Abby, I'm sorry.
I know this stinks.
But I have to do
what I have to do.
I'm a traveler.
I'm proud of the fact I can
pack my whole life into two suitcases.
Cheer up, cheer up.
I might be back.
Ethan, [... ] off.
Get lost, you jerk.
You know, see, I thought
of all people in the whole world,
you'd understand this.
Keys are by the bed.
Please.
Wait.
[Giggling]
[Voices overlapping
and telephones ringing]
[Wind chime tinkling]
[Wind howling]
It's Ethan.
Leave a message.
[Ethan speaking Japanese]
[Electronic beep]
Hi, it's me.
Look, I'm really sorry about
everything we said.
I know that this is
all my fault.
You were right.
I put a lot of pressure on you
about me coming here.
So I just want to tell you
I'm sorry,
and I would love
to talk about this.
So call me, okay?
I'll be up.
Okay, I hope? I hope
everything's going good.
Thanks, bye.
Excuse me?
Is anybody here?
Hi.
I don't understand.
Are you open?
[Speaking Japanese]
Thanks.
[Abby sobbing]
I don't know what I'm doing
with my life.
I'm a complete mess.
My cousin Heather
just got her PhD.
And here I am four years
out of college, Phi Beta Kappa...
and I've got nothing
to show for it,
not one single thing.
[Sobbing]
And I thought I was so brave
coming to Tokyo...
but Ethan just left me,
and I'm?
I'm so alone.
What?
Oh.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, eat.
It was delicious.
Thank you.
Ra-men.
Thank you.
Here, how much?
Are you sure?
Thank you.
Thank you.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
See, I live right across
the street right down there.
Okay.
Thank you.
Hanako-san?
Do you know how to cook ramen?
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, of course not.
It much too difficult.
You have to training to do it.
[Man speaking Japanese]
[Voices overlapping]
I have your umbrella.
[Speaking Japanese]
[Giggling]
[Abby giggling]
[Laughing]
[Giggling]
[Laughter]
[Rhythmic percussion music]
[Rhythmic chanting and clapping]
My parents sent me a ticket,
and I have less than 24 hours,
and I really
don't want to go home,
so please, please
call me back, okay?
I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.
Can I help you?
Huh?
You need to rest.
Your foot.
Hi.
Here you go.
Here.
No, I don't want to go.
I want to stay here.
No.
No, please, I want to stay here.
No.
I want to cook ramen.
Huh?
I want to cook ramen.
No, you teach.
Teacher.
- Huh?
Please.
Please let me help you
around here.
Let me help you.
I want to? I want to help.
Be my teacher.
Teach me.
I want to make people happy
the way you do.
Huh?
I want to make people laugh
like you do.
And I know Ethan's coming back.
If I leave,
then I may never see him again.
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Go ji.
Tomorrow.
What?
Morning. Morning.
Tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow morning at 5:00.
It's in the A.M.
It's 1:00 A.M. Right now.
What am I doing?
You know, my parents are
expecting me home tomorrow.
[Bell ringing]
Hi.
Good morning.
It's 5:00 A.M.
Huh?
You told me to come by at 5:00.
5:00 A.M.
Yeah.
I'm here.
So what would you like me
to do first?
Where should I start?
Arai.
Um, what?
I'm sorry,
what did you just say?
Oh, sorry, sorry.
Sorry.
Arai, arai, arai.
I finished.
I mean, I figured you wanted me
to clean all the pots and stuff,
so I did.
I hope that's okay.
I-I mean,
I didn't put them away.
I didn't know where they went, so?
But I will.
Here?
Do you want me to chop?
No.
I washed those already.
I washed those already.
It's washed.
It was? It's dry.
Washed.
I'm so sorry,
I didn't see that.
I scrubbed and I scrubbed.
Let me do it, please.
Please let me do it.
I'll do it for you, please.
I want to work, please.
It's okay.
It's okay, I'll do it.
I do.
I'll do it.
Okay, can you just stop
yelling at me?
I'm doing it.
I-I'm washing your toilet.
I thought you wanted me
to clean the toilet.
No?
What?
No.
Yeah?
Over there?
What's over there?
Don't? Hey!
[Knocking on door]
Hey.
No!
Hey!
Hey!
Big jerk!
[Screams]
Sorry, sorry.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Gosh, what a hard day.
What?
What, you want me
to clean those now?
Right, of course you do.
[Electronic beeping]
[Man shouting in Japanese]
Well, I'm still here
and doing the same grunt work.
Would you please call me?
Bye.
[Shrieks]
You're just drunk.
Huh?
You're supposed
to be teaching me.
That was our deal, remember?
Ramen.
Ramen.
Me.
You teach me
to cook ramen.
Screw this.
This is ridiculous.
This is flat-out abuse.
Nobody, not anybody
with any self-respect,
would put up with you, you...
fascist!
I'm out of here.
What?
Oh, I'm sorry,
how could I possibly
forget that?
Clean.
Clean the floors,
clean the pots,
clean the toilets,
clean!
I don't understand what the hell
you're saying, okay?
And I'm sick of trying.
Good-bye.
Clean.
My dad told me
I never stick to anything,
and he's right.
I never managed to hold a job
more than four months.
I came here because I wanted
to be with my boyfriend.
And since he left...
I've just been hanging around,
waiting for him to come back.
I will clean for you.
I'll clean the windows,
the pots, the floors, whatever.
I stayed up trying to think of
the reason why I wanted to stay,
and the only thing
that I could think of,
the only reason was?
What?
Oh.
You need it?
Right.
The floors.
[Laughter]
Am I? I'm fired?
Am I fired?
Thank you.
Thank you.
[Exuberant rock music]
Life goes by in a million
shades of gray,
slaves to the clock hanging on
till it's time to play
There's a part of me
that's anything,
anything but ordinary.
Let it all out now.
Turn it up loud.
Got to show my wild side now.
Ethan's such a jerk.
We could have told you that.
But you didn't.
I must have left him at least
a hundred messages.
I don't even think he listened
to one of them.
What happened to you?
I walked into a door.
So what now?
You going home,
back to America the beautiful?
America the bland, beige,
and boring.
I'd rather die
than go back there.
No, I'm staying.
Has that sucky job at
the law firm gotten any better?
Oh, I'm?
No, I'm not doing that anymore.
So what are you doing?
I, uh...
I'm training, you know,
to become a...
a ramen chef.
Isn't that that noodle stuff?
Our poor girl's
gone off the deep end.
Ramen?
Yes, ramen.
[Laughter]
What's he saying?
I have no idea.
Who cares?
Look at him;
he's gorgeous.
You are really studying ramen?
I'm trying to, yeah.
Wow.
That's awesome.
Tell me, where did you learn
to speak English so well?
I lived in Los Angeles
for one year
when I was a college student.
So what do you do now?
Oh, yes.
Our job is very exciting.
Oh.
In America, I think
you call it pushing papers.
Oh.
These are my colleagues,
Akira.
I am Akira.
And Kuma.
Call me Kuma.
I'm Abby.
Abby.
- Charlie.
- Gretchen.
Gretchen.
Toshi.
It's a pleasure
to meet you all.
Whose side do you think
he plays on?
It's hard to tell.
He's Japanese.
So, Toshi, where to next?
- Ramen.
- Ramen.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
Gretchen.
Nice to meet you.
Kuma.
Charlie.
- Good night.
- Bye-bye.
Good night.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Do any of you guys
have money for cigarettes?
Oh, here you go.
Thanks, Charlie.
What time is it, anyway?
It's almost 5:00.
Thank you
for taking us out tonight.
You are welcome.
See you again?
I'll give you my card.
Oh.
Thank you.
"Toshi Iwamoto."
Thanks.
Good night.
Have a beautiful morning.
Nice meeting all of you.
Call me.
Call me please, some time.
Oh, yeah?
Witch.
Call me.
[Laughter]
She is priceless.
I-I think I know.
Let me try. Let me try.
The spinach...
here.
Pork.
And this...
at 2:00.
Ow!
What are you doing?
Can you show me?
Show, show me.
Here, please,
tell me what you mean.
I was?
What, are you crazy?
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay.
[Knocking continues]
I'm so freaking wasted,
I'm about to collapse.
You got any beer?
Sure.
Oh, thanks, doll.
Drama.
Total freaking drama.
You would not believe the stuff
I've been through tonight.
The creep who pays the rent
on my apartment
keeps bringing home
his asinine friends,
asking me to do them favors
and stuff.
Once in a while, okay.
I mean, it's a great
freakin' apartment.
But there is a limit.
Tonight, when I get back
from the bar,
there he is
with Godzilla man
asking me to do him
another "favor."
I lost it.
If you think I look terrible,
you should see the apartment.
So do you think
I could crash here?
[Knocks on door]
Oh.
You.
Hi.
Hey, Abby.
Hi.
Coincidence.
Gretchen didn't tell me
you were living here.
Gretchen is full
of surprises tonight.
Um...
she's right in here.
Please.
Thanks.
Um...
where should I put
the suitcases?
Oh, anywhere you want.
It doesn't matter.
Gre?
Gretchen?
Gretchen?
Gretchen.
I really need to sleep, honey.
Toshi's here.
Great.
She's asleep.
Yeah.
She looked really tired.
What happened?
She called me
and asked me if I have a car.
Yeah?
She sounded very upset.
Her life is very complicated.
Tell me about it.
Well...
probably, I should go.
Sorry to bother you.
No.
Wait.
Do you want something to drink
before you go?
I mean,
you've come all this way.
Personally, I could
really use a beer.
Yeah, me too.
Okay.
That's the ramen shop
where I work.
Easy commute.
Yeah.
- Your boss.
- Mm-hmm?
He speaks English?
Oh, not a word.
Really?
I can't understand
a word he tells me.
Not to mention he's psychotic.
He keeps trying to kill me.
Why do you stay?
Hmm.
Maybe it's because
I have nowhere else to go.
Hmm.
That's pathetic.
No.
I think you're on the path
to something.
One day, I'm sure
I'll taste Abby's ramen.
God, I hope so.
Yeah.
So what about you?
What's your path?
My path.
Hmm.
Typical Japanese.
Work in a big company,
get married,
have children,
grandchildren,
grow old,
then die.
That's just grim.
Back in college, I wrote music.
I had a band.
That's cool.
Most of the time,
we just got really drunk.
[Laughs]
And we were talking about
how we were going to make
the revolution in
the Japanese music world.
Then, of course,
we all became salary men.
It's what our parents wanted.
My parents would only be happy
if I became a partner
at a major law firm.
Strange.
Who'd think to look at us
that we'd have the same problem?
Omoshiroi ne.
Interesting.
Somewhere along the way,
I just forgot what I wanted
to do with my life.
Sometimes when I wake up
in the morning,
I can't breathe.
That's probably why I started
this icky habit.
Sorry.
I smoked your last one,
and I don't have any.
Want to take a walk?
It's a monsoon.
[Laughter]
I guess I should go home now.
Almost the morning.
Have you ever been
to the ramen museum in Yokohama?
There's a ramen museum
in Yokohama?
You're kidding me.
I'm not kidding.
What? Really?
Yeah, really.
Okay, I have to see this.
Yeah, so, um...
let's go then, next weekend.
- Yeah, okay.
- Great.
I'll let Gretchen know.
I don't think
she's interested.
Yeah, but it would be awkward.
You know, she's my friend.
I have to let her know.
You guys are going out and all.
Hmm?
But that first night,
you took the taxi cab
home together.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
She just shared the cab with me.
Oh.
[Laughter]
So it's okay?
I call you?
Yeah.
It's okay.
You call me.
In a one-horse open sleigh.
Over the fields we go,
laughing all the way.
Bells on bobtails ring,
making spirits bright.
Oh, what fun it is to laugh and sing
a sleighing song tonight.
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way.
Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
Jingle bell, jingle bell,
jingle all the way.
Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh.
Hey.
I wish I could understand you.
Merry Christmas!
[Laughs]
Yankee, go home.
I'm sorry.
I thought the decorations
would look nice.
I bought them at the market.
Look.
Look at the color,
the texture.
I think corn could be beautiful.
Huh?
[Voices overlapping]
Merry Christmas.
Oh. Arigato.
Arigato.
Merry Christmas.
[Crying]
Hey, Japan,
I was fired tonight
on Christmas Eve.
Rotten, heartless Japanese.
Cold-blooded Japan.
I'll tell you one thing,
nobody's running this goddess
out of town.
The longer I'm here,
the more I realize I don't
understand anything or anybody.
Like my boss, I?
I used to think
it was the language, and now?
Now I realize I just
don't get him at all.
It's a bowl of soup.
For Christ's sakes,
tell the man to get over it.
Mm-mm.
No, no.
There's something about
the Japanese
and making the perfect bowl
of soup.
It's kind of beautiful.
It's like with each bowl,
you try to get closer
to perfection.
I think that's beautiful.
Isn't that beautiful?
It's insane.
Listen to me.
The only way you're gonna
survive in this country
is to do
what everybody else does:
Drink.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, love.
[Voices overlapping]
Thank you very much.
I'm so full.
This is gonna be great.
[Voices overlapping]
[Fog horn bellowing]
When I was a kid,
I came here one time
with my school.
The other kids
always made fun of me
because my grandparents
came from Korea.
I wanted to run away
from those kids
and sneak onto that ship.
I wanted to go away
from Japan to somewhere.
Where?
I don't know.
Just I wanted
to go away from Japan.
Oh.
You are cold.
I should take you home.
No, I don't want to go home.
I'd rather be here with you.
I don't understand you,
and would you stop hitting me?
"I don't understand.
I don't understand."
Sensei.
Who's that guy in the photos?
Photo.
You know, the one you cry over?
Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.
Boo-hoo-hoo.
He's handsome.
Paris.
Don't hit me.
Don't hit me.
Oh, where you going, tough guy?
Huh, tough guy?
Oh, what, you can dish it out,
but you can't take it?
Yes.
I got you.
What? What is?
What's wrong?
I don't understand.
Ohayo.
Ohayo.
You look so serious.
My boss wants me
to go to Shanghai.
Oh, no.
I've heard this before.
For how long?
Three years.
Three years?
How long have you
known about this?
Since a couple of days.
You're not going,
are you?
I have to go.
It's my obligation.
Oh, my God.
I did it again.
I don't want to leave you.
Then tell them
to send somebody else.
That's not how it works
in Japan.
If the company wants you to go,
you have to go.
But how can you spend
three more years
in a job you can't stand?
How?
Why don't you just tell them
to go to hell
and do something? Something
that you really love,
something for yourself?
And don't say
it's because you're Japanese,
'cause that's just an excuse.
I am Japanese.
Why do Americans think
everybody should be like them?
I-I've said everything
that I could say, really.
Abby.
What?
Would you please come with me?
Where, Shanghai?
Yes.
We could be together.
Please.
Don't do this to me.
Please, Abby.
Please.
Come with me.
[Maezumi singing in Japanese]
Sensei?
Please, will you taste my broth?
Please, sensei.
[Singing continues]
[Gasps]
What are you doing?
I did everything I saw you do,
everything.
I'll miss you.
I'll miss you too.
Are you sure you won't
come with me to the airport?
No, no.
That'd be too sad.
Can you just tell me again,
just? Just one more time.
You really, really wanted me
to go with you?
Go.
Go.
You're gonna miss your flight.
Go.
Go.
Sensei, wait.
Sensei, please help me.
I keep trying,
and I never get it.
Please.
Teach me how to have?
[Wooden pounding sound]
Ah.
But how?
I don't know anything
about love.
Every time I feel it,
it's gone.
It disappears.
And all I have left is...
pain...
and sadness.
[All weeping]
[Laughing]
[All weeping]
[Laughing]
[Dramatic percussion music]
[Snoring]
[Coughing]
[Cheers and applause]
See you again.
I just needed
to create something for myself.
"Myself, myself."
"Sa ku se sa."
"Successor."
Successor.
You...
my successor.
I'd be honored.
[Laughs]
Where's sensei?
I can't leave without
saying good-bye to sensei.
[Rhythmic clapping and chanting]
[Cheers and applause]
[Rhythmic chanting and clapping]
[Voices overlapping]
Four Tokyos, one Goddess,
and one Maezumi Special.
In a minute.
Hey, Abby, there's a guy here.
He says he knows you.
Who is he?
From where?
I don't know.
I hated my job,
so I did what you would do.
I quit.
I started writing music again.
Welcome to my ramen shop.
[Upbeat indie rock music]
Staring at the pot,
she was putting in a lot
of her time.
Her heart was beating
in her chest.
She's pointing and swearing,
and it's mine.
It's mine.
My ramen girl,
seen from above,
and shining bright like a pearl.
My ramen girl
made me a specialty,
messed with my world.
Have you ever seen
a girl on the scene
quite like this?
On the streets of Shinjuku,
I promised you a taste,
and it's bliss.
She's got me all confused
about a little more than food.
It's like this.
She knows just what to do.
Moves around the stove
like a dancer.
I have to pursue.
The aroma draws me near.
I lose my mind
and fall to my knees
as the world disappears.
No, she didn't.
Yes, she did.
My ramen girl,
seen from above
with a shine in the night
like a pearl.
My ramen girl
made me a specialty,
messed with my world.
