Mrs. Frenchie's cat is missing. 
The signs are posted
 all over town: 
"Have you seen Honey?" 
We've all seen the posters... 
... but nobody has seen 
"Honey" - the cat. 
Nobody...
<b>... until last Thursday morning ... 
when Ms. Colette Piscine swerved her car
to miss Honey 
while she drove across the bridge. 
Well, this bridge, 
now slightly damaged, 
is a bit of a local treasure. 
and even has 
its own fancy name: 
'Pont de flaque' 
Now, 'Colette' ... 
that sounds like 'culotte' 
That's 'panty' in French. 
And 'Piscine' means "Pool" 
"Panty Pool" 
'Flaque' also means pool in French.
So, Colette Piscine, 
in french 'Panty Pool', 
drives across the 'Pont de flaque'
or 'Pont de Pool', 
if you will
to avoid hitting Mrs. French's cat
that's been missing in Pontypool.
Pontypool ... Pont de Pool ...
Panty Pool ... Pont de flaque 
What does it mean? 
Well, Norman Mailer, 
he had an interesting theory 
that he used to explain the 
strange coincidences 
in the aftermath
of the JFK assassination: 
In the wake of huge events, 
after them and before them, 
physical details - 
they spasm for a moment. 
They sort of unlock,
and when they come back into focus,
they suddenly coincide 
in a weird way: 
street names and birth dates
and middle names ...
... all kinds of superfluous things
appear related to each other. 
It's a 'ripple effect' 
So, what does it mean? 
Well, it means something's
going to happen ...
Something big ...
But then, something's always
about to happen. 
No, no, nothing has got to do with you.
You gotta be the worst fucking agent in the world!
Come on! It's not enough to say "I'm working"
It's not enough, do you understand?
Well, if you think it is enough, then
maybe we're not thinking the same way?
You know what I mean?
You know what, Rick?
You're fired! You're fired!
Good.
Now we're both in the same boat
Oh, Jesus ...
What?
Hey!
Hey ...
Hey!
Hey ...
Who are you?
Who are you ... Who are you ...

Okay Mazzy, come on boy, please.
Be positive.
Morning Mr. Mazzy.
Good morning, Laurel Ann.
I loved your 'Isn't It Ironic?'
this morning. 
Love Norman Mailer.
Thanks.
You know, it takes a girl with
big feet to dig old Norm'.
So, did you give me the good stuff?
Let's make radio!
Laurel Ann, do me a favor ...
Look up all the information you can
on 911 calls.
How many in a 24h period, 
how many hang-ups...
That sort of thing ...
...and... thanks.
Let's make radio!
Good morning, Pontypool.
This is Radio 660, the beacon.
Down here in the dungeon, 
under the street they call 'Drum'.
I'll be banging the drum for you all morning.
I'm Grant Mazzy and as always... 
...I'll be takin' no prisoners.
Now... mmm... I got my coffee here.
... and taking a look outside
I'd say... that's our 
top story for today, folks.
Now, I had a strange experience
on my way in to work this morning.
And I'd like to get some advise
from you people later on.
When do you call 911? Think about it!
I should mention, our producer,
the lovely and talented Ms. Sydney Briar,
is here.
And 'lucky' Laurel Ann Drummond...
she'll be our technical cowgirl today.
Now, I didn't know this - maybe you did -
but this is news to me ..
Laurel Ann did a tour of duty
in Afghanistan not too too long ago
You're right, there, new guy. 
Everybody does know.
She was a "Grand Master" at 
last year's Fall Fair.
- Yesterday's news.
- Hey.
Oh, sorry Laurel Ann. 
I wasn't the "Grand Master",
but I was the "Homecoming Hero"
I'm sorry. OK? I'm ... very bad.
Oh Sydney, Sydney, Sydney! Come on, girl!
- I'm sorry!
- It's OK.
You just heard an honorary 
apology from Sydney Briar.
She probably owes Laurel Ann
quite a few more! Stay tuned!
Now, in our top story today ...
... a big, cold, dull, dark, white ...
... empty, neverending, 
'blow-my-brains-out' ...
... seasonal affective disorder...
... freaking 'kill-me-now'
weather front...
... that'll last all day.
Or maybe, when the wind shifts, later on ...
... we'll get a little green-house gas
relief from the industrial south.
'Hail Mary, Yea though I walk...'
- we go to Ken Loney...
... in the 'Sunshine Chopper'.
- It's always brighter above the clouds, Grant.
- Hey, Ken, how're you doin'? 
How are things in that bird up there? 
Are you going to stay up there during the storm?
Yes, Sir. Yes, Siree,
Well, that can't be safe. 
Is that safe, Ken?
Well, I'll be up here, Grant, on storm watch,
watching all of the routes in and around our region.
- Really?
- Really, yup.
OK, Ken. Boy, I wouldn't want to be a bird,
if this storm hits the way it's supposed to.
Don't call it bird, by the way, Grant. 
And leave Ken alone!
I think he's just concerned.
Thanks you, Ken Loney.
Breaking news out of Caesarea this morning...
Come on, boy ...
There we go!
Breaking news: The Ontario Provincial Police
are reporting a major bust...
...of a significant grow operation
in a quiet cul-de-sac in that town.
Constable Howard Ing says that
it's a sign of things to come.
Do you smoke pot, Syd?
Yes, I do.
Don't make global warming jokes.
What? I didn't make a joke, I quoted the Bible.
Ain't no jokes in the bible.
Speaking of the Bible,
we are in a church, not a dungeon.
Thanking you, Constable Howard Ing
of the Ontario Provincial Police.
You know ...
Our local pot growers...
...are engaged in a deadly serious business.
Deadly booby-traps...
... protecting their operations from prying eyes.
Land mines have been found in the backyards...
- Cool it, Grant!  
- They have vicious attack dogs and
enough ammunition to arm a small country!
Now, these are family neighborhoods, folks!
If Junior throws a ball through one of their windows ...
... he's just liable to trigger a death squad!
What are you doing?
My producer says... she's talking in my ear.
Luckily you can't hear her.
- Nobody cares, Grant, about your...
- Sydney says nobody cares. Maybe she's right.
- You forgot to do the closures after the billboard, I need you to...
- But I think you do care, region.
"Taking no prisoners" - you know what that means?
It means full disclosure, whatever the consequences.
No, not 'full disclosure', Grant!
'School closure.'
I need you to read school closures.
That's what people need!
This is Radio 660, the beacon...
Hey ... You can't just cut me off like that!
Jesus' ...
OK, you know, Grant, the whole 'full disclosure' schtick...
.. works better in a bigger context.
Well, actually, this won't get me fired.
Well, there's that to.
The thing is, that in small towns, 
they already come without prisoners.
It's called "gossip"
and it's way ahead of you.
No no, Sidney, I'm not talking about gossip.
I'm talking about building a relationship with
my listeners.
You know... shaking them up a little bit.
OK, we do news, weather, sports, local spots.
- That's what I need you to do.
- Hmm.
What the hell do you think you have to disclose to us anyway?
I mean, what it this that you think we need to hear from you?
I don't know... Well, actually, I do know, Sidney.
I am trying to piss a few people off, 
because that's how it's done - simple as that.
You see, a pissed of listener is wide awake listener,
and he ain't gonna change the station.
In fact, he may just call his pissed off brother,
and get him to listen too.
And then, his pissed off brother, he might call his pissed off
... I don't know... preacher.
And that, Lady Briar, is how you build a loyal listening audience.
Uh, OK, well. That all sounds perfectly pleasant, I'm sure, OK?
You know, Grant, you're first rate, 
and you're doing a first rate job...
... but just let me tell you something. ...
Small towns, they're fiercely proud places,
with... with proud people.
People who need to know
if the school bus is coming.
And so, if you come in here with your
'take no prisoners' this
and your 'pissing everyone off' that,
people are just gonna think you're a dick!
- OK ... OK.
- And... I mean, you're going to embarrass and alienate...
Ok, I said OK.
I'm sorry, it's just the reality.
OK. Grant, I want your maziness.
I hired your maziness. I want the maziness. 
I just need the maziness to come in a little slower,
a little more 'get to know you'.
A little... a little slower.
Yeah, I get it. I'm not stupid.
That's not what I meant.
I wanted to hear what he was gonna say.
Come on, he was just gonna talk about himself.
OK. Pontypool, good morning.
You know, I want to talk to you about something that
has been bugging me,
all morning.

Here's my question, Pontypool. Here's my story. 
Now, hold on...
I'm driving in to work today,
and I pull up to the stop sign at Drum and Main, and...
it is 6.30 in the morning,
it's cold, and it's dark ...
and suddenly, this woman appears out of nowhere
I didn't hear her, and my car was barely even moving.
Suddenly she's at my passenger window.
She's babbling something ...
But I can not understand her, I can't hear her,
I don't know what it is.
And then ... 'poof'! She's gone!
So, what do I do? Do I call 911?
Who do I call?
No one.
Our number is 519-555-3486
Let me know what I gotta do.
Good morning.
Oh, where are you calling from?
And what would you like to say to Grant this morning?
- I'm sorry ... what?
- Has my sister called in yet?
No
That's weird ...
My sister never, ever, ever misses a day.
And where is Roger? It's almost 10.
What are those?
Grant gave us Valentines.
You can put them up somewhere.
You know, he... he's doing okay.
So, okay sweetheart, I'm gonna call Mrs. Tripp.
Something's coming in on the radio.
Roger, where are you?
Yeah, roger that. We still have a Code 48 in progress.
It's the fish hut.
Sydney! Syd!
... requesting backup.... weapons present ...  10-4....
- Sandy Hook, Code 48.
- What is Code 48, Laurel Ann?
It means we have a hostage situation.
There's nothing on the wires,
so I'm gonna key in right off the police radio.
Really, there's nothing on the wire?
OK, so look, let's not do anything with this yet.
Yeah, no, I'm not getting anything either.
Whatever you do, don't feed this in to Grant yet.
Oh, shit!
Yeah, Grant, it's Gordon calling.
I just want to throw this idea out there...
about the 911 ...
What if you had another number, that was ...
I don't know... like 912 or something, 
that was not for total emergencies, 
so if you.. get into a gray area and you weren't
sure you wanted to call 911 you'd call 912 ...
I...I...I just have a feeling it just might catch on. 
Some people might, you know....
Gord, that's a great idea. 
You should be running the world.
Pontypool ... My Pontypool...
We interrupt our call-in segment
to bring you breaking news out
of our area this morning:
Out on Sandy Hook and Wilmont we have a hostage situation.
Two men are holding a van load of people at gunpoint.
The van is apparently toeing... a fishing hut
Sporadic gunfire has been reported.
Okay, lose the story, Grant. We're going to Ken Loney.
We're going to the 'Sunshine Chopper'.
No one knows as of yet what these hostage takers want,
or whether or not they even know the people in the van.
We know they're drunk, Grant.
It's the end of ice fishing season.
...but ... this being the end
of ice fishing season...
...ice hut removal time...
the chances that everyone on the ice this morning is drunk
is a very distinct reality.
Drunk ice fishermen... dare I say:
drunk policemen?
Drunk officers of the law.
Drunk Ontario Provintial Police.
It is not yet confirmed by our sources, of course.
But, police,
possibly drunk,
are reporting that the hostage situtation
has resolved itself.
They have two suspects in custody.
Both unarmed, as it turns out,
and the three people they were 
holding have, in fact, fled the scene.
One can only hope that Breaking News theme music
will accompany this story at some point.
There we go.
Oh, the state of drunkenness have levelled off
to acceptable levels this morning,
as 'Buddy' Bob Roseland and 'Dead Eye' Derek McCormack,
OPP Pontypool Division...
- Wrap it up, Grant!
- ...have contained the hostage situation.
We'll be back with updates, as the situation hiccups.
We now go to Ken Loney
in the 'Sunshine Chopper',
for a little perspective on your morning drive.
Keep an eye out for crazy ladies in the snow,
and remember:
Wherever you're headed,
get there safe!
Come on, you gotta learn to laugh at yourself sometimes!
The story is not funny.
Derek McCormack is an alcoholic.
Bob Roseland is an alcoholic.
They're trying to keep their jobs.
- Derek's my brother-in-law... Ex-brother-in-law.
- Ouch!
Grant ...
Ken Loney is not in a chopper.
What?
The 'Sunshine Chopper' is Ken's Dodge Dart.
He plays sound effects.
Ken sits up on a hill,
for his aerial view.
And... people are thrilled to have him up there in the sky,
flying around in his 'Sunshine Chopper', even though...
Oh man, I bet they are... OK.. ok...
Syd ...
Yeah?
I hate winter.
Everyone does.
No, not like me.
These late winters I feel like I'm living in the basement of the world,
... and it's so cold, and so dark.
Well, you're gonna... it's gonna be ok.
Oh, and Grant, I'll tell you what: 
when the whole fish hut story gets confirmed, 
we'll bring it straight to you, right away, ok? 
And it's yours, even if it's not legitimate...
... you can do your whole... 'take no prisoner'-thing, ok?
And you'll find it funny this time?
I'll find it as funny as I did the last time, I'll betcha'!
I was talking to Constable Roseland - he's totally serious!
I mean, he has completely freaked!
Something happened this morning on the ice...
...and it's put them on to a state...
and now he wants us to drop the story.
Drop it?
- Now, it's probably nothing. It's probably just a hoax,
- Probably.
Anyway, so, we've got the 'Laurence of Arabia' cast
coming in, so we're gonna brighten up the day with that.
Laurel Ann here.
OK, OK. It's Ken Loney.
Hey, Ken! Oh... Ken, slow down...
Ken, where are you?
Okay. Ken, slow down.
Slow down ... and how many? 
Okay. Ken, just a second.
Okay, wrap up 'Pontypool Corner', Grant.
We have a big story breaking. Listen to me...
Keep it hard, okay?
Ken, just a second.
Just a second, we go live.

... so I'll check it out and make sure it's right,
that the're both at the same time,
... but that's what it looks like..
We have breaking news out of our region this morning.
It appears, it seems that a large
group of people have gathered
outside the officies of Dr. John Mendez.
It appears to be a protest of some kind,
and officials are describing the crowd as 'unruly'.
Now, Dr. John Mendez, you may recall,
He was the... he was under investigation for
writing unnecessary prescriptions.
We have an exclusive live report,
from Ken Loney in the... 
in the 'Sunshine Chopper'.
What can you see there, Ken?
Grant, I'm watching hundreds, literally hundreds of people
packed in and around this building.
It looks... it looks pretty odd from up here.
They seem to be trying to cram themselves inside... Oh! Ohh!
What's happening, Ken?
The side of the office.... this building has just burst open, 
it's spilling people
It just kind of exploded!
Oh, Jesus! It's an explosion of people!
Oh, my God!
People are getting trampled.
These people are getting killed down there!
Ken, do you see any police?
Is anybody trying to restore order... down there?
No! No... I don't see... Wait ... Wait ...
There's a.... convoy of trucks ... military vehicles ...
Where did they come from? What the hell ...
Helicopters ...
There's a... helicopter at my two o'clock and one at... uh...
Holy shit, I gotta... I gotta back up out of here.
OK, Ken... Ken... Get safe!
Just... just try to get out of there.
The road is blocked. There's definitely fatalities here.... 
uh... down there. People have just died, Grant.
I don't know what the hell has just happened.
Well, we're gonna have to see if we can...
Ken, what?
Ken? Are you there, Ken?
- Okay, we've got nothing on this, Grant.
- We've gotta get some information on what's clearly happening.
- Christ, this is 5 km from here.
- Not more than 3... uh.... 5 km from the station itself.
Don't say a lot, Grant
We need to get this confirmed somehow.
Something has happened at a doctor's office,
here in Pontypool, 
involving a possible riot.
- I can't get through to the OPP.
- Clearly, something has happened, here in Pontypool.
Okay, we've lost Ken.
Go to break, go to recap, Grant!
You heard our own Ken Loney describe...
...what he saw, or at least what he thinks he saw.
You know, the french philosopher Roland Barthes
once described trauma as a news photo without a caption.
And that, folks, is what I think we have here now.
Is Ken back?
We're trying. We're trying and getting Ken back, 
and we're trying to reach the police.
We still have nothing on the wire on this entire story.
Laurel Ann and I are gonna work the phones. 
We're gonna work our sources.
We gonna try and find out something solid
we can put on the air.
Okay, and what do you want me to do?
Well, "Lawrence & The Arabians"
have come all this way. Yes, hi.
You're gotta be fucking kidding me ...
Grant, I don't need you to be a problem right now.
But Sydney, Sydney, we've got the hook.
You can't just cut the line like that!
I just need you to do your job.
These five people, you're going to interview them
and then they're gonna sing a song...
Sydney, do you really think that this is what
our audience is expecting to hear from us right now?
...so Laurel Ann and I will dig up a story on this,
that we can put on the air. 
Thank you.
Okay... Okay, fine... let's do it!
Let's find out how the fuck rehersals 
are going in fucking Arabia! 
Come on, gang! Come on!
RICK RYAN
Listen to this, Rick ...
This is Lawrence of Arabia.
Something's definitely happening, we can't just leave this.
We can't go back on the air without something solid.
Laurel Ann, find me somebody I can put on the air.
Well, I've got Aline Freethy on line two.
She's hysterical, but she seems to be in the middle of things.
See if you can calm her down, see what she's got.
Why isn't there anything, anywhere, on this?
These are... bedouin girls.
Grant, we're trying for eye witness...
We'll have somebody for you when your singers are done. 
This is Osama bin Laden.
Fuck you, Rick. 
Ok, that was Tony Burgess, Maureen Hinkle, Nancy Freethy, Jay Pullman and
Colin Pullman singing "The Nefud Desert"
I can't remember how it ends, I can't remember how it ends ...
How what ends, Faraj?
It just keeps starting over and over...
and over and over...
It is not called 'The Lawrence and.... 
the table' is it? No, not anymore....
Okay, folks. I guess that's it.
Ok, I've got Steve Van Denzen.
He's at the Mendez' office,
and he's talking about a mob, or parade, or something.
He's very excited.
- Ok, any word from Ken?
- Nothing.
Shit! Ok, I'm gonna keep trying Roseland. 
See if you can get the straight talk from Van Denzen.
Sydney, there's something very weird going on with our...
...girl Faraj there.
Ok, you were great, Grant!
You did your job and ..
Didn't you hear?
Yeah, I know you really wanted to stay
with the story.
I needed you to buy us some time, and I appreciate it.
I really do.
So... I have something now, 
and I'm tossing it all back at you.
- Ok, great! What do you got?
- There's still nothing anywhere on the wire regarding this mob scene,
but I've got ten eye witnesses in town.
We're going live, with Steve Van Denzen.
That's great! 
- Fuck the wire if we've got eyes!
- Keep it hot, Grant!
Girl, you got it! Hit me!
Any word from Ken?
Nothing.
Welcome back, folks...
.. to our developing story...
...where it appears that hundreds
of people have been involved in a riot,
in and around the offices
of Dr. John Mendez.
You heard our own Ken Loney
describe the violent scene.
We now go to... live, to eye witness Steve Van Denzen.
Steve? Steve? Steve Van Denzen.
Oh, ok, I'm afraid we've lost the signal from Steve Van Denz  en.
We'll try and return to him later,
but, we have just hed a report 
from a Pontypool resident, that confirms...
... indeed, a mob was spotted, earlier today...
headed through town, headed toward 
the offices of Dr. John Mendez.
Apparently they were moving ...
- And, we're still waiting to learn exactly,
- Shit, I've lost my eye witness!
what motivated this crowd, this mob...
- ... to organize in this, seemingly spontaneous, fashion...
- Grant, I think people are fucking with us.
You know, it's very difficult at this moment,
to get a fix on what has happened, but clearly...
Well, you heard our own reporter Ken Loney earlier...
I don't know, Grant. I don't know...
We can't get Ken back on the line.
- We are still trying to contact Ken.
- This is completely fucked! I don't know what's going on!
CLSY?
Can you slow down? I can't understand what....
- CLSY?
- Ok, hello?
We have also learned that some of
the perpetrators are speaking in bizarre ways.
They're babbeling in ways that no one understands...
... and we don't know if this is a way
of trying to terrorize people? We don't know.
Hello, CLSY.
I'm sorry, what did you say?
- We still do not have an official version of these events...
- Okay, sounds good.
- ... but it has been reported that up to 75 people are dead.
- Sounds honest. It is honest.
- And at least twice that number are injured.
- I've CBC and CFRB on the line, wanting to talk to you.
We now take you to
Constable Bob Roseland,
of the Pontypool unit of the OPP.
He's on the line, live.
Constable Roseland, what's happening out there?
At 7 o'clock this morning our officers answered a 911 call,
to the Golden Dawn facility,
to discover a large number of people
occupying the building.
They seemed to be trying to get into the elderly woman's room...
...and this woman has since died, from incidental injury...
- Grant, appearently these people were chanting something.
- ...as a result of people piling into her room.
- A little creepy, chanting something...
- And what where they saying?
They were repeated things this woman was saying.
She's all senile, so she's babbling about Hitler and some hurricane
that killed her mother and father...
Crazy talk. 
Get out, Grant!
Okay, thank you Constable Roseland.
Now, we are also hearing... 
about a herd...
Well, that's how it's been described:
a herd of people ...
... near the edge of the forest
near Highway 26, in Edenvale.
Where is Edenvale, Sydney?
That's northwest.
Now, Edenvale is northwest of us.
- And, also, between here and there, in Phelpston, a couple...
- Please, keep holding. Thank you.
...with their two young children had been trapped in their car, 
under a mountain...
- A mountain of people ...
- Okay. Apparently, Grant, I'm being told by Rachel Jones...
- Now, this sounds strange, folks...
- ...that these people were imitating windshield wipers.
- ... but this what's being reported to us.
- Making the sound of windsheild wipers.
The police say they haven't been able to
actually see the car in over an hour.
- Can I put your call on hold for a sec?
- They sound like bugs.
- Sydney, I've got BBC World on the line.
- BBC?
There are a growing number of eye witness accounts,
but we still have had nothing official. No press conference...
- ... has been held and we have no official statement.
- Grant, I've got Nigel Healing for you.
What?
Yes, Nigel Healing from the BBC. Don't talk to me, talk to him. 
Listen! Our air, their air - they want to go live. Let's just do it!
We're talking to Grant Mazzy, the news radio anchor from
Pontypool, Ontario in Canada, who broke this story. 
Mr. Mazzy, are you there? 
- Grant!
- Yes, Nigel. Hi.
Mr. Mazzy, is it true that French-Canadian soldiers
have set up road blocks  
preventing people from leaving
and entering your area in rural Canada... 
I havn't heard anything about this, Grant.
I don't think he knows what he's talking about.
...and if so, does this have anything to do with your
country's history of separatist terror groups?  
Well, Nigel. None of that is true.
The military, of course, is rumored to be involved,
and, of course, the police are responding as we speak, but...
from what we can tell there's nothing organized...
... nothing political,
cartainly not terrorist... or separatist.
But, Mr. Mazzy, this certainly looks like
an insurgency of some kind.  
Large groups of people
are involved.  
But, if it's not organized, as you say,
and it's not political, 
then can you help our viewers at home
understand exactly what it is we've been reporting on?  
He's good.
Nigel, the honest truth is that no one has officially
come out ahead on this.
We simply do not know.
There you have it ... 
A series of strange riots
and violent mob scenes 
in rural Canada, that no one, I repeat,
no one can explain.  
Meanwhile, reports presist that
French-Canadian riot police  
have been called in to
crush this insurgency.  
Fuck you, Nigel! 
He knows nothing!
Where are you?
Ok, I'm gonna pass you through to Syd.
- I've got Ken.
- Ken!
That was Nigel Healing from our affiliate station, BBC.
We now go to Ken Loney,
live in the field in Pontypool. 
Our reporter Ken Loney.
Are you there, Ken?
Yes... Yes, I'm here.
Send someone, I'm not safe here.
Not safe where, Ken?
Oh, don't say where he is, in case something happens.
... at the grain silo.
I'm near the train tracks.
That's the big silo, not the little ones.
I ran here from the entrance of the Imecan
National Park.
They came after me... You gotta send police.
There's no contact with the police, Grant.
There's no reaching the police.
Can you tell us what heppened?
What's happening there, Ken?
I'll tell you this ...
I just saw ...
I've seen things today that are going to ruin
the rest of my natural life, Grant ...
and I'm scared ... I'm scared ...
Ken. Ken, listen to me.
It sounds like you're okay where you are, 
so don't move, and you just stay there, and we're gonna...
I saw ... Some of them are cannibals
and others are naked ... and like dogs.
Their eyes ... that look... 
It's just a startled, wild...
Oh God, Grant!
Ok Ken, listen ...
No, no, no! You don't understand ... I'm looking through a
little door, there's a little door at the base of the door...
.. it's some kind of cat door, or something. I can see the...
Let me move so I can see the....
NO! LOOK OUT! .. Oh God ..
They're pulling two people out of a van.
- Who are they, Ken? Who are they?
- There's a bunch of them. They're people, but they're crazy.
They're ... they're pulling these two out of the van.
Oh, my God! They're ... they're biting them!
They're actually carrying them 
to the ground in their mouths!
I can't... I can't see ... they're biting, there's just biting, 
they look like a school of fish, like a frenzy... piranha.
It almost as if... It's like ... 
It's like these pople are trying to climb,
or eat their way inside!
They're so desperate, 
like they have to be inside....
One has his entire leg and
another his arm ... it's right inside....
Stop this, Grant! 
They are pulling themselves apart!
Stop this now!
Argh! Oh shit! He heard that... one looked over, he heard me.
Oh, he's coming. Holy shit! I gotta hide! He's running! He's running!
Ken, get out of there.
Ken? Ken, it's Grant. Are you... are you injured?
Have you've been hurt?
No, no. I'm... just lying here. I'm in the dark.
It... It crashed through the wall... it was Mary Gault's boy.
Her big teenager Jesse? Or Jake, or something?
- Oh my god... Jesse ... 
- It was him. He had no hands...
The kid had no hands ...
Grant, let's stop this now!
- What's he doing now?
- Not on the air, Grant. I'm not gonna listen to somebody get killed on the air.
He's looking at me...
I think he can't move ...
He must have broken some bones.
I can see his eyes... He can't move ...
Wait, wait....
- I think he's ... hang on...
- No.
Ken, whatever you do, don't go near him.
He's... he's whispering something ...
He's saying something ... 
I'm gonna get closer and see if I can just
hear what he is saying ...
No, I wouldn't do that, Ken.
What the hell was that?
- Ken?
- They cut into our signal!
Ken? Do we still have Ken?
- No, we've lost Ken.
- We've lost Ken, folks.
We are working on a translation of the message
we just received live on the air.
It's something about "avoid family members"...
... "Talk only to babies" ...
It's crazy shit.
- ... however, working on a translation.
- OK, I've got it!
It's on your screen.
OK, we have the translation. 
Now, I'm gonna read this,
reminding our listeners that the source
has not yet been identified...
... and early analysis has identified...
this as possibly a hoax of some kind.
And I remind you that the source was not us, 
and indeed, we do not know the source.
FOR YOUR SAFETY, PLEASE AVOID
CONTACTS WITH CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS
AND RESTRAIN FROM THE FOLLOWING:
ALL TERMS OF ENDEARMENT,
- SUCH AS "HONEY" OR "SWEETHEART"
- Sidney.... Yes Bob, what up?
WHEN YOU TALK WITH YOUNG CHILDREN,
AND RHETORICAL DISCOURSE.
FOR GREATER SAFETY, PLEASE AVOID
THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
PLEASE, DO NOT TRANSLATE
THIS MESSAGE.
What've you got?
That was Bob Roseland. He said we have to stay inside.
Pontypool's under quarantine.
Everybody's have to stay inside at all times.
Did you get...?
Hello. Hello.
- Did you get that?
- Ken?
I'm sending you some audio with my phone.
- Thank God, Ken! Are you there?
- Did you get that?
No, Ken, I didn't get that. 
I didn't get anything right now.
Ok, ok ... I'm gonna try that again.
Ok, listen...
... and keep in mind... picture this... This is ... 
What you're about to hear is coming from Ms. Gault's big teenage boy.
He's lying here, in the dark. with his body ...
It's broken to pieces, and his wrists. I can see them... 
They're stumps. They're... not stumps, they're pointing up at his sides.
No, Grant! What are we doing?
Listen ... listen ...
Mommy ... Mommy ... Help me ...
Help me ... Mommy
Did you hear that? I do not even know how he's doing that.
It sounds like there's a child is screaming
inside his breath ...
- Is this actually happening, Ken?
- Easy, Grant. Easy!
Alright. That was our own Ken Loney. 
What? That was our own Ken... Ken Loney...
- You're on the radio, ain't cha ...
- interviewing ...
- You are on the radio, you big ...
- a screaming baby ...
... coming from Mary Galt's eldest son's last dying gasps.
Mazzy in the morning ...
- What?
- Grant ... Grant ... fish, there were gold fish in it.
There was a little baby ...
A tiny little baby ...
- Grant!
- What?
Ok, Grant. Listen to this. 
BBC is going wide with the Mendez story.
He just said "Honey".
He just said "Honey - the missing cat poster".
- What?
- The missing cat poster, "Honey"... "Honey, the missing cat", Grant?
Grant? Oh, jeez. Laurel Ann, let's go out.
School closures in 5, 4 ...
Are you finding this funny, Syd? 
Are you laughing?
It's not a joke, Grant.
I beginning to think this is not a joke.
Everything that I've got looks real.
The cat?
Well, Nigel Healing said, apparently...
"Nigel Healing said, apparently..."
Can you fucking hear yourself?!
Don't yell at me, Grant!
Oh, I'm sorry ...
Syd, you know I'm having a lot of trouble here... believing this.
I know, Grant. I know. Me too, okay?
I mean... is somebody pulling my leg,
are they, like... taking a piss out of me? You know?
Like it's some kind of stunt?
Well, there's some dead people.
Pretty big number, I think.
Look, I gotta get out of here, ok?
I'm having a lot of trouble believing that this is actually
happening, ok? So I'm just gonna get out of here for a minute.
Grant. Grant, I just need you to sit back down...
You stay there, okay? I need you in your chair. You need to sit back down.
Okay, we've got crickets.
- Laurel Ann, go to pre-tape.
- What pre-tape?
I don't care! Anything, just go to pre-tape!
Wait... where are you going?
Okay, you know. I need you back in the chair, okay?
- Oh, man. I gotta go outside, and take a look at....
- Grant?
Grant ... I can't have dead air!
Sydney, does this have
something to do with me?
What are you talking about?
This! I mean... why...?
Why are they carrying dead cat pictures, huh?
I mean, this is me going crazy.
You know, I need to feel that there's something solid.
I need to confirm ...
I need to know that there's more happening to everyone,
than what's happening to just me, you know?
Grant, come on!
You! You are fucking with me!
You are fucking with my head!
And you ... don't you fuck with me!
Grant! Grant, come on!
It's dangerous!
Don't go, Grant!
There's people dying...
I gotta take a look out there. 
I gotta see what's going on out there!
Don't go in the blizzard - I need you on the radio!
Don't walk out on me, Grant!
Please, I need you!
Shit!
Fine, just fucking fall apart!
There nothing ...
Just a cold, cold, cold day.
Oh, shit!
What're you looking at?
Shit! Move!
"Don't you walk out on me, Grant" 
"Please, I need you ... "
- What was that?
- We have an enemy, sir.
Laurel Ann, 'we've got an enemy'?
Okay, what's going on?
Those are my words ...
Those are my words ...
What is going on?!
I'm scared!
Sydney, listen ... I'm scared, too. 
You're cut!
- Laurel Ann, we've got a first aid kit?
- Yeah, OK.
- What's going on?
- Sydney, focus here. Focus. Look at me. Where are your kids?
They're with him. They're in the city.
That's a hundred kilometers away. They're safe, right?
Oh, God. Yeah.
They're safe, okay.
We've got work to do. I'm going back on the radio.
This is a hell of a shift, Sydney.
What's up first?
Obituaries.
Obituaries?
Okay, but I've got nothing taped.
Then we'll go live!
Live! That's what I want to hear. Let's go!
"Gwendolyn Parker was taken from this life in her 45th year
by her beloved husband Stanley ...
who left this world suddenly,
at the hands of family members Fiona and Michael,
who then died at each other's hands in their 12th and 17th
years respectively."
"Janice Gwynne has departed from her abiding husband and by his own hand,
in her 34th year of her life."
Jack Gwynne survived long enough to add four names...
Paul Hieghton, 43, Alice Hieghton, 42, Brenda Hieghton, 12, and young 
Jesse Hieghton, 10 ...
...  to a list of passages before himself
losing his life as a result of an accident."
"Greg Olan, 56, has been killed
by Yolanda Olan, 61 ...
who also removed Frieda Olan, 81 ...
Patsy Owen, 12, John Freethy, 33, Peter Stamp, 38 and Leslie Reid, 42 ... 
who had, between them, caused the untimely passings of
Joel Froth, 67,
Sandra Weydon, 23 .. Tim Drummond, 17
Cynthia Drummond, 46 ...
Darren Drummond, 51 ...
and Alicia Drummond, 91."
"The Drummond's were survived on Cynthia's side by the
Hindman family,  ...
until shortly before noon today ...
when they were sadly removed from this world by a bus
driven by the recently departed Brenda Lockland, 43 ...
which was missed, briefly, by her husband,
Gary, 37 ... now deceased."
You are listening to "In the Mourning" on 
CLSY Radio.
"David and Susan Varier Jones
married for 51 years ...
died suddenly in each other's arms,
by each other's grip."
Are you listening to this?
I'm really trying not to...
Shit! I left my cell phone
in the sound booth.
I want to talk to the kids.
When he's got them, he turns the cell phone off.
Or doesn't pick up, I don't know.
He's a jerk.
So, did anything.... this crazy
ever happen to you in Afghanistan?
No. Sir. I believe the situation
I brought back in my head.
What do you... what do you mean?
I don't really know.
I'm gonna go see if Mr. Mazzy's missing.
Missing ... missing ... missing
I mean... Mr. Mazzy... Mr. Mazzy's missing.... 
as in 'he's not here'.
Well, honey. He's in the sound booth.
- Yes, I know ... I just ...
- Ok?
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go...
Excuse me?
Sorry, please don't be alarmed. I'm Dr. John Mendez.
I've not had a lot of time ...
I've literally been crawling on my hands and knees
throughout town, all over... and... and....
OK, don't say anything, okay? Oh boy!
She's has just started doing this.
Sorry, I'm a doctor. We should slip out.
Laurel Ann? Laurel Ann, honey. Are you okay?
No, no. It's time to go and keep moving.
She'll follow our voices. We have to... 
What's that?
It's the sound booth.
Life boat! Let's go!
Mr. Mendez is missing Mazzy... No!
No, I'm Missy Mazzy and I have to ...
We just need to get a bit of lead time away from her.
Do not worry. She doesn't have ...
What's wrong with her?
Hurry, hurry!
Grant! Grant!
It's Dr. John Mendez.
Mendez?
You had the building that exploded?
I think he probably has quite a story to tell.
Dr., would you like to have a seat?
- You mean - on the radio?
- Yeah.
Oh, yes, I have a story one to tell.
No, guys. Wait! I'm not missing anymore.
I don't miss Mr. Mazzy ...
I think it might be a little bit more interesting
that with Nigel Healing, huh?
- What going on?
- Your friend is sick.
I've seen a lot of this lately.
She doesn't know it yet, 
but... she's hunting us.
I don't miss Mr. Mazzy.
I'm not missing anymore. Sydney!
- She doesn't look...
- Hey, come on! We can't just leave her out there. 
I want to talk to her, Grant, put the sound out...
No, no! Let's leave the sound sealed in here with us
She might lose track of where we are, if she can't hear us.
You are listening to 'The Beacon'. We are holding our own here today.
We are taking no prisoners, friends.
However, today we are those prisoners.
We are tired and we are scared.
But, we have live with us Dr. John Mendez.
Now, you may know him, or you may recall our own
Ken Loney's vivid account of the violence that took place...
...when the mob destroyed his practice.
Now, Dr. Mendez, we're looking to you. 
You've had some special experience with these... with these events.
We would like any insights that you can provide...
Laurel Ann, don't do that! Stop!
Oh, she is rooting for voices. Huh-huh.
This will grow vicious.
I should mention that, uh, sadly... very sadly...
our own 'Homecoming Hero', 
Laurel Ann Drummond, is right now experiencing
some kind of dangerous seizures.
I've seen this, what your friend's experiencing.
Ok ... can I? Ok.
I've seen elements of this.
She doesn't have a victim yet ...
So I'm not sure how this will end.
I mean ... A victim suicides.
But.. the victim needs a victim
to suicide into.
I know this is horribly upsetting to you, and I'm sorry
to be the bearer of such disturbing news, but...
- Sydney.
- ...I've seen this violent behaviour at my office all morning.
Yes .. Ok, we're going live.
- I've got Ken.
- Oh, Ken! Okay, thank you Dr. Mendez.
We are going to our own reporter, Ken Loney,
live in the field. He's in a grain silo near Pontypool.
- Are you there, Ken?
- I'm here, uh. Ken Loney, reporting from inside the grain silo.
Ken, we were very worried about you.
- I'm OK, but the person who was in here
with me - he has died.
Have you been there all this time?
- Yeah, I haven't moved, but... you can hear crowds,
from time to time, passing by outside.
You can hear what they're saying? Are they saying anything?
I have... you can't hear them. 
A group went by about an hour ago ...
... and they were talking about ... "U-boats"
Well, they weren't talking, really...
They were just sort of... chanting...
Something about "Look out for U-boats"
"Look out for U-boats" ...
"Look out for U-boats"
Where they all saying this, Ken?
Yes, all of them ... it's a symbol of the disorder.
A 'symbol' of the disorder?
You mean .. a 'symptom'...
It a simple ... and ... it... 
I have a problem.
What's happening there, Ken?
Do you need to get to someplace safer?
No, no .. that's not it ...
and I ... I ...
What's going on, Ken?
It's... it's gonna sound weird... I can't stop thinking.
Do you have a 'sample'? 
What's that? A sample?
A sample of what?
Just... uh, a sample, I think a simple kind of sample ...
And ... what I'm saying ... I need to ... I can not stop.
sample ....
so sample ...
sample, and what I'm trying to say...
Just try to stay calm, Ken.
- ... and what I'm trying to say ... Grant, Grant ...
- Ken ... Ken?
I'm just gonna try to... try to ...
Can you think?
I can not, I can not ...
Stick to simple questions, simple!
Simple questions, simple ...
simple ... simple ...
That's it, he's gone.
This is what he is now...
He's just a crude radio signal.
He's seeking.
Simple, simple, simple...
Simple, simple, simple...
I think it's time to say goodbye, Grant, 
to our man in the 'Sunshine Chopper'.
Allright. Goodbye, Ken.
Goodbye from all of us,
everyone listening, 
I hope you can hear me, Ken. Goodbye.
He's gone. Well, I mean. 
He's gone... somewhere.
I'm so sorry, Sydney.
Ken was ... He was... 
a really good friend of yours, wasn't he?
No, he wasn't a friend ...
Ken Loney was a pedophile.
I mean, not really a pedophile. 
We just never let our kids go anywhere near him.
It's just... I've known him for 17 years.
That's just... such a long, long time.
Shit! I wasn't a very good boss.
What's this now?
Folks, we're still here...
... and Laurel Ann has joined us again.
She is... looking ... worse.
She's been trying to eat something.
Are you sure she can't hear us?
No. No, she can't.
Can she read lips?
Good question ...
Read lips ...
What?
No, it's a very interesting thing you just said.
Can they read lips?
Really? Interesting... how? How?
- I should... remind our listeners, we are talking to ...
- No, it can't be ...
Can't be, it's impossible!
What's impossible, Doctor?
It's viral, that much is clear.
But... not of the blood. Not of the blood, not of the air.
Not on, or even in, our bodies.
It is here!
Where?
It is in words.
Not all words ...
Not all speaking ...
But in some.
Some words are infected.
And it spreads out when the contaminated word is spoken.
Oh, we are witnessing the emergence of
a new arrangement for life,
and our language is its host.
It could have sprung spontaneously
out of a... perception.
If it found its way into language,
it could leap into reality itself, 
changing everything!
It may be boundless ...
It may be... a God bug!
Dr. Mendez, I don't even believe in UFOs,
so I gotta stop you there, with that 'God bug' thing.
Oh, really? Well, that's really sensible,
beause UFOs don't exist,
but I assure you, there is a monster lose,
and it's bouncing through our language,
frantically trying to keep its host alive.
- Is it transmission itself that ...
- No, no, no ...
If the bug enters us, it does not enter by making contact with our eardrum. No.
It enter us when we hear the word
and we understand it. Understand?
It is when the word is understood,
that the virus takes hold,
and... it copies itself in our understanding. 
Well... should we be ... talking about this?
What are we talking about?
Should we be... talking at all?
Well, to be safe - no, probably not.
Talking is risky.
And, well... talk radio is ... high risk, so....
We should stop.
But, we need to... tell people about it.
People need to know. We have to... get this out.
Well, it's your call, Mr. Mazzy.
Let's just hope what you're getting out there
is not going to destroy your world.
The whole world can hear you breathing.
It's fine, you're breathing.
That's your top news story!
Can't take your breath away, if you're breathing.
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe ...
Go to muzak, Grant.
Key 14
Seems we're still talking. 
Should we make our moratorium official?
- Hello?
- Here she comes.
Hey, Honey! 
Hey, Sweetie ...
You and Brandon are OK?
I miss you too so much, Honey. 
I'll see you tomorrow, huh?
That's great, Honey.
Is your daddy there?
Can I talk to him really fast?
Honey, I didn't forget to call you.
I just couldn't get through, Sweetheart.
You shouldn't be talking to anyone who calls!
And no "Sweethearts", please. 
You should be breathing more.
... breathe ... breathe ... breathe ...
Just talking out loud. 
Just talking out loud.
Could you please get your daddy on?
It's not your birthday today, Lulu.
it's Valentine's Day, Sweetie.
It's not really a good time right now, Sweetie.
Can you just put your daddy on?
Happy Valentine's Day to you, Lulu!
Happy Valentine's Day to you, Lulu!
'Cause I love you ...
Lulu? Lulu? Hello? Hello? Honey?
Shit!
The phone lines are dead.
Something strange is happening to her,
I've haven't seen this before.
I forgot to give her at
Valentine's Day card.
Grant, thanks for the Valentine card.
I didn't say anything, I'm sorry,
It was very nice.
So, this is what happens when a
victim can't find a victim.
This is the fate they're trying to escape.
My God, that was impressive!
And ... singularily most defies comprehension!
I'm sorry ... I'm sorry.
Breathe ... breathe .. breathe ...
Oh ... here they come now.
There must be hundreds of them,
pressed against the walls of this building.
What we need is a flamethrower.
I thought we weren't supposed to talk.
Yes, yes, yes. 
You're right, you're right, you're right.
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
IF WE THROW OUR VOICES
WILL THEY FOLLOW?
LOADSPEAKER OUTSIDE?
MESSAGE WILL TRAVEL.
WHAT DO WE SAY?
S.O.S.
WE ARE HERE
SYDNEY BRIAR IS ALIVE!!
Sydney Briar is alive
Sydney Briar is alive
Sydney Briar is alive
Sydney Briar is alive
I looped it.
We can breathe again...
breathe .. breathe ... breathe ...
OUT
It's only the English that's infected.
Do you speak French?
A little bit?
We speak in French.
Let's go.
Can I go?
ln French! ln French!
Stay here.
Goodbye!
Where now?
To the kitchen.
Grant! Run ... run now!
"Grant! Run ... run now!"
Come get me!
"... Come get me ... come get me ..."
He's still going!
Maybe... he is dangerous?
Yes.
Are you going to kill the doctor?
No.
You killed the kid...
...you go kill the doctor.
l... l didn't kill the kid.
Yes.
No.
Yes!
You killed the kid.
Not me!
l killed the kid.
So... you kill the doctor.
I? Please ... no ...
I'm not gonna kill the doctor.
Ok.
lf the doctor attacks us...
l will kill him!
Here he comes!
The door! the door!
Sydney Briar is alive
Goodbye!
He's saving us ...
Sydney Briar is alive
My name is Sidney Briar
and today I killed a girl.
I'm so sorry.
Why don't you speak up?
French!
Sorry!
Continue.
Don't talk.
My head hurts!
For Christ's sake, give it up, Grant.
There's no secret escape plan hidden
in the words that Nigel said to you.
Stop!
Stop it!
Syd ...
We're not talking. I'm drunk.
This is how my last relationship ended.
Why do you stop understanding this?
Oh, God!
You're gonna eat me soon, aren't you?
That's OK. You be the killer.
I do not want to be the killer.
Something Dr. Mendez said: He said that understanding a word
copies the virus.
So how do you... how do you not understand a word?
OK, you're talking... a lot... right now...
I don't understand something. Somehow... I understand automatically.
How do you take, like, a word... How do you make it strange?
We're gonna have killers here soon, 
if you keep killing your own rules, Grant.
I do not understand what disinfects it.
You see, that's the question.
If it disinfects it, without distorting it, how ...
How do you do that?
Grant, you kill the word that's killing you. 
Oh, you kill the word that's.... 
That's good, that's good! You repeat it!
Yeah, I remember as a kid... I used to... I used to
repeat words over and over and over again...
..'til whey were incomprehensible.
Do you think that's what it is? 
Is that why they're repeating things?
Is it some kind of immune system response?
You have to kill ...
All the killing...
Yeah, but it doesn't work, because they 
repeat the words and still get sick.
So how do you make it unrecognizable?
How? And what word?
"Kill"
Kill ... kill ... kill ...
Syd.... are you okay?
Ok, Syd, Syd. Sydney, I think you got an infected word.
You're infected.
But we know the word and.... 
Don't say anything. Don't say anything.
No, no, no. Stop!
Stop! We know the word!
Okay, 'kill' isn't 'kill ... 
Sydney, 'kill' isn't 'kill ...
'kill' isn't 'kill ...
'kill' isn't 'kill ...
Oh God... I do not know!
I don't know.... I don't know.... OK! OK!
"Kill" is "blue"
"Kill" is "wonderful"
"Kill" is "loving"
'Kill" is "baby"
'Kill" is "Manet's Garden" ...
'Kill" is "Beautiful morning...
...comes after everything 
you've always wanted" ...
"Kill" is "Kiss" 
"Kill" is "Kiss"? Is that is?
"Kill" is "Kiss"!
What is "kill"?
"Kiss" ...
Kill me...
What?
Kill me ...
"Kill" is "Kiss" ...
Ok, I feel better.
- I feel better.
- Me too.
What just happened? Seriously, seriously...
What just happened?
We just kissed.
I know, I know, I know...
But what just happened also, though?
Sydney, I think something big just happened.
I think I just cured you. Sydney... This is big. This is huge!
Where you going?
We've gotta let people know about this.
We just found a way out of this!
Shit! Grant, wait, listen to me ...
Grant, what are we doing? What are we doing here!
Come on, girl! One last show!
One last... what? Grant ... Grant ... Listen to me!
We're not supposed to be even out here... 
What are we doing here? It's not safe.
Syd, we're gonna save the fucking world. 
Right now. How are you feeling?
Well, you don't even know that you did that, or what you did,
or how you did it...  Listen, listen Grant! Stop!
Listen, you're way ahead of yourself! We're ok, OK? 
We're safe up there.... if we just don't talk. 
We have to stay safe, it's what Mendez said. Take it easy.
Shit, Grant! We shut up or die!
People are already dying, Syd,
while we we're playing muzak.
Do we really want to provide a genocide 
with elevator music?
I don't know what I did up there, Syd,
but I gotta try!
- Because if I don't ... what?
- Ok, ok ... It's OK.
- Yeah!
- Oh, you're killing me, Mazzy.
Now, get going... go, go, go!
- You there? You there?
- Yeah. I'm here. I'm here, Grant. Grant?
Hello, yeah, I'm here.
Ok, we're gonna do what we can.
Now that french thing, he said:
terms of endearment and baby talk... OK?
And... we've got your word, 
we've know how to clean that on up, right...
- Now, what was Laurel Ann babbling about?
- I don't know, I don't remember.
Ok, ok... Well, Ken Loney said 'sample'. Was that it, 'sample'?
Ok, we need a list. Can you make a list?
There is no time, there's no time... You're just gonna
confuse people ... What are you planning to do?
OK, put me on, put me on!
You're on!
Hello Pontypool. This is Grant Mazzy here and today
we're taking no prisoners.
In fact, today we set those prisoners free.
So here we go, folks: "Kill" is "Kiss"
'Kill' is definitely 'Kiss' ...
'Sample' is 'staple'
- Grant! Too specific, Grant.
- Listen to me, folks ... everything is something else, OK?
- Sidney Briar! Are you still alive?
When you are saing 'happy' it means 'sad' ...
No, that's the opposite, it can't be that. Can't be that.
'Happy' is 'handy' ... move things around, people ...
You have to stop understanding ... 
Stop understanding what you are saying
Stop understanding and listen to me ...
'Sample' is a 'color', 'sample' is a 'color'...
Grant, you're making sense, but if you say
'don't understand it' it defeats the purpose.
Sidney Briar! Stop the broadcast!
Stop the broadcast!
The man speaking is sick!
The 'sky' is a 'person' ... 'laughter' is 'walking'.
'Yellow' is 'crowded' ... 'friends' are 'verbs'.
'Teeth' are ...
Sounds like shitty haiku, Grant. I may be wrong, 
but I don't think we're saving the world with shitty haiku!
Okay, For Christ... like everybody is a critic.
Help me out here ... 'cling' ... 'cling' ...
'Intake'
'Trespass'
'Sniper'
'Swimming'
'Tomorrow'
'Fidelity'
'Monologue'
'Savage'
'Sausage'
'Tomorrow'
'Money'
'Ceiling'
I, I don't... Grant ...
'Rhinoceros'
'Laughter'
Shit, Grant! They're just shooting people, Grant!
They're just killing people!
... 
Stop killing people! 
You gotta stop killing people!
You gotta stop! You gotta stop! Stop! Stop!!!
Just listen to me ...
I said, listen to me ...
I think everyone's dead.
You're just killing scared people.
It's what you always do.
You're killing scared people. You are like dogs ...
You smell fear and you pounce.
Well, what the fuck happened today, folks?
Someone took a buzzsaw to your middle ...
... and they pulled out a wheeling devil ...
... and they spilled it right across your anthill.
But you know what, friends?
We were never making sense.
We were never making sense.
And today, today when Armageddon
leached out in your good, good mornings ...
You know what?
It's just another day.
Another day in Pontypool.
The sun came up. You did what you did yesterday, 
and it's exactly what you'll do tomorrow.
Today's news, folks ...
Today's 'late breaking', 'development', 
'just across my desk' news story is this:
It's not the end of the world, folks.
It's just the end of the day.
This is Grant Mazzy,
for CLSY-Radio Nowhere.
... and I'm still here, you cock-suckers!

... 10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ...
... 5... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 
"Police are warning that travel between towns
in central Ontario has been restricted ... 
The Prime Minister is scheduled to adress
the nation this evening at 9 o clock, and in this
announcement he is going to declare martial..."
"... morning DJ Grant Mazzy speaking incoherently
just minutes before that station's signal was... "
"... just off this, normally busy, highway, beyond the 
road block that prevents us from getting any closer...
... sits the normally quiet town of Pontypool, 
the scene of today's Valentine's day massacre ... "
"..that's what I was, a looney. 
This whole pattern in my head is off.
I feel better now, I'm having a coffee. 
I'm gonna take the dog out for a walk and clear my head, but... "
You can almost see the curve of the earth
- a horizon. Well, what do you think would happen
if you start to identify... let's say, the twelfth view out there...?"
"You are listening to South Hits Radio Impero,
and we have breaking news over our city this morning ...
... as of 10 am his morning, OPP reports an alarming number
of community crimes, vandalism, looting and numerous
assaults widespread across Peterborough ... 
We believe that this is related
to the Pontypool incidents,
but want to assure the public that what is happening there
is not happening here. I repeat: the events of February 14th
are not being repeated here..."
"... because, my neighbour kept on repeating
what he was saying again and again and again...
I'm like... I don't understand what is going on here ..
Can you tell me anything else that's happening?"
"... families up this highway, stores and churches,
in - one assumes - the same tight fabric... 
...that binds all these small communities, 
dotting this part of the country ... 
... Now everything that we find familiar - out here, 
at this safe distance - they're in all likelyhood - gone. 
Just up this barren stretch of Ontario highway..." 
"One can only hope that the disease, 
if that's indeed what it was, killed them, before we had to..." 
"No, but, the wife can talk me crazy,  
my teenage kid too, except the opposite: 
he hasn't spoken a complete sentence to me since last June ...
... Anyway, yeah, we're all driving each other nuts ... "
"I was watching the TV and they have a brief little thing on it,
saying that there's an outbreak or something ...
"... I don't see any vaccinations trucks or... like you see in the movies. 
I saw that 'Outbreak' movie there, a few years back, I rented it, 
and it's not quite like that. I don't know what to think here... "
"I wasn't saying that it's funny, I knew Grant Mazzy ...
I respected the man, and I think he would want us to ask questions ...
He would want us to find out what is really happening - what's real."
"...and that's the latest from Kandahar. 
In other news, French Canadian riot police...  
... have successfully contained the violent uprising 
in the small town in Ontario, Canada - Pontypool ...
Pontypool ... Ponty... pool ... Ponty... pool ... Pohonty ...
Let's get out of here!
Where are we going?
I can't follow by the establishment rules any longer.
My patience has worn thin.
We'll breaking the limits, stealing cars ...
Leaving the world behind to figure out
what they believe is black and white.
- But what about...?
- What about? What about 'what about'?
It's not a good anti-conceptual way
to begin a question.
- My name ...
- My name too ...
Johnny "Dead Eyes".
Lisa "The Killer".
Where are we going, Johnny?
To a new place, that isn't even there yet.
And then...?
Then we steal the loot and
knock boots in the free world, baby.
- OK. Ok, baby ... 
- Shhh ...
