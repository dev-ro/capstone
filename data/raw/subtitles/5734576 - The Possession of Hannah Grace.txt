In nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.
Amen.
Hannah.
Hannah.
Hannah.
No.
God himself commands you,
depart from the body
of Hannah Grace, you demon,
along with every satanic power
of the enemy,
along with every specter
from hell.
Stop!
Hannah,
I know you're in there.
You have to fight, baby.
Fight it, Hannah.
Fight it.
Fight it, Hannah.
You have to fight.
Baby, it's me.
- Dad.
- Daddy's here, baby.
- Dad.
- Honey. Baby.
Dad.
You have to fight.
In the name of the Father,
in the name of the Son,
in the name of
the Holy Spirit.
Hannah, stop!
No.
Your whore daughter is mine.
She's mine forever.
Forgive me.
Meg. Hey, it's Lisa.
I just talked to Dr. Lewis
and you're good to go,
so maybe you can
come in this afternoon.
Okay, bye.
Hey.
You look nervous.
Are you okay?
It's a job interview. I think
I'm supposed to be nervous.
Okay. Come on,
let's go get a coffee.
This will be good.
We'll go to meetings in
the morning after our shifts end
and I'll be three floors up,
so if you need anything...
You know?
Thank you for this.
Don't thank me yet. You still
have to meet Dr. Lewis.
This job is not for everyone.
We've had three overnight
intake assistants
in the last
six months alone.
Because of the hours?
No, because it's a thankless,
solitary position.
The smell. You never get used
to the smell.
I was a cop. I'm totally
used to bad smells.
Lisa mentioned
that there were issues.
Yes. There were issues.
But I'm much better now.
Well, she assured me
that you could handle the job.
Is it something you think
you can handle?
I can handle it.
Going down.
It gets to you after a while,
being here.
People get creeped out.
Before you know it, their
imaginations are running wild,
they're hearing things
go bump in the night.
Not me.
I believe when you die,
you die.
End of story.
Good.
Arrived at morgue.
At night,
you can't get in or out
without swiping
this card.
If you lose it, hospital
security has to let you in.
They will not be happy.
Most of the lights
are on a sensor.
The rest you have
to switch on manually.
There are a lot
of files that
need to be entered
into the system.
I hope you
don't mind data entry.
No, not at all.
Men's room is down there,
women's room is down there,
and down there to the left
is the incinerator room
for cremation.
Intake bay.
This intake
bay is for drop-offs only.
No drop-off, no access.
And you never leave the premises
while you're on duty.
No exceptions.
Arrived at morgue.
Well, you bring the cadaver up
from the intake bay,
and take it into the receiving
room, which is over here.
Image captured.
First you take an overview of
the body and then close-ups
of each individual injury.
- Image captured.
- All right, you try.
Rigor mortis makes a corpse
difficult to fingerprint.
Now, if you press on
the knuckle, it will extend
the finger,
and make it easier to handle.
Gently roll.
Scanning.
This doohickey sends the prints
to a crime database.
Green means they're ready to go.
Red means they're not.
Yeah.
Green...
Green means go.
- Thanks, Moe.
- You bet, Doc.
The shift starts
tomorrow night at 11,
goes to 7 in the morning.
- Any problems with that?
- Not at all.
Well, thank you
for the opportunity.
I promise
you won't be disappointed.
Welcome to the team.
Thanks.
Hey, do you need
to see my I.D.?
Do you work here?
In the morgue.
I'm Megan.
Then no.
Hey, I'm Dave.
- Megan.
- Nice to meet you.
And, you know, welcome
to the graveyard shift.
Thanks.
Morgue.
Intake bay.
Arrived at intake bay.
Who are you? Where's Larry?
I don't know who Larry is,
but I'm Megan.
Morgue.
You've got to be the right kind
to stomach a job like this.
Personally...
I'm not what you'd call
a people person.
Dead's the way
I like them.
Image captured.
Scanning.
Green means go.
Hey.
- Goddamn it, Dave.
- Sorry.
Not funny.
I didn't mean to.
I honestly just came down
to check on you.
Shit. I feel like an asshole.
Forgive me?
I'll never do it again.
Really not funny.
Hey.
- Why didn't you shoot me?
- Megan, do something.
I don't know what
triggers it, really.
A lot of things, I guess.
But I still have nightmares
of what happened.
Put your hands up!
Me just...
standing there...
doing nothing.
I just freeze up
and I can't move.
Officer down. Officer down.
It's okay. I've got you.
I've got you.
I want it so bad sometimes.
The drink and the pills,
I want them so bad.
Thank you, Megan,
for sharing.
Hey.
I just, um, need
the rest of my stuff.
My shift just ended,
but if this is a bad time...
No. No, come in.
And you're still in
your pajamas because...?
Oh, I, uh...
I started a new job
last night. A night job.
That's great.
Doing what?
Overnight intake assistant
at the morgue.
It's better
than it sounds.
Yeah, I'm basically running the
place at night, all on my own.
Are you sure that's
a good idea, you know...
spending so much time alone
right now?
Actually, I do.
You know,
it keeps me from
going out at night
doing things I might regret
in the morning.
It worked for Lisa
and she thinks
it could work
for me, too.
- "Lisa"?
- My AA sponsor.
The nurse at the hospital.
She says it keeps her
out of trouble
working the night shift.
So, when a job opened up at
the morgue, she thought of me.
Yeah, still, too much time alone
is never good for anyone.
Says the guy who moved out.
You didn't give me
much of a choice.
That's not true, Andrew.
You know that's not true.
Since when are you concerned
about the truth?
I didn't come to...
I should go.
Intake bay.
Arrived at intake bay.
I forgot my key.
Could you open the door?
You don't work here.
Yes, I do.
Just let me in.
- Sir, back away from the door.
- No. No. No.
- Sir.
- Let me in!
I'm going to call security.
Back away from the door.
- Morgue.
- Let me in!
Let me in!
Security.
Hey, I had a homeless guy
at the intake bay.
Thanks for the heads-up.
Yeah, we get that a lot.
Yeah.
Arrived at intake bay.
- Drop-off?
- Hey, yeah.
Ooh. You're new here.
- Megan.
- Randy.
Could you give me a hand?
I'm all alone tonight.
Sorry. I can't leave
the premises.
Yes. Yeah.
Stickler on the rules.
But I'll tell you right now,
if you don't help me get
this thing inside,
it's going to start
to rot and decay.
It's just going to blow up
like a puffer fish.
And then we're both going
to lose our jobs.
Unless...
- What do you think?
- All right, okay. Fine.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
You're the best. My partner
called in sick. Strep throat.
Which is 100 percent
grade-A bullshit because...
- Do you want to grab that side?
- Yeah.
He is holing up with
his psycho ex-girlfriend.
It seems like he should
be making some new friends.
Yeah, I think
he should probably pick
a better psycho
ex-girlfriend next time.
So, I want to say
thank you, by the way,
because the guy
who used to have this job
would never have
just done that.
He was a prick.
Horrendous breath.
- How long have you been here?
- I just started.
Arrived at morgue.
- What happened?
- Oh, yeah, it's a bad one.
The cops found her in an alley.
One, two, three.
Yeah.
Yeah, so the guy
was still slicing her.
He took off. They still
haven't found him.
- Did they find out who he was?
- No clue.
"Hannah Grace."
Yeah, that's what
it said on her I.D.
I told you it was bad.
That's not even the insane
thing. The insane thing is
they found chloroform
by her body.
What kind of a lunatic drugs
a girl, smashes her head in,
and then tries to burn her body
after she's been dead?
I'll tell you who it is.
It's someone trying
to send a message.
It could have
been her pimp.
It might have been
a drug dealer.
It could have been
a sex thing.
Thanks, Randy.
I can take it from here.
You got it. Yeah.
All right.
Thanks for the help,
Megan.
Yeah.
Intake bay.
It gets easier.
I promise.
Thanks.
It's all part of the job.
Error. Unable to load image.
Error.
Unable to load image.
Ow!
Okay.
What?
Error. Unable to load image.
Ow.
All right.
"Username."
Megan Reed.
"Password."
Bye-bye, Megan.
Andrew Kurtz.
"Password."
Megan.
08162014."
Brown.
Get out of here.
You're losing your mind.
It's freaking hot.
Dave?
Dave, you promised.
Dave!
Oh, my God.
If you scream, I will
have to slit your throat.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Do you understand?
- Come on.
- Security.
There's someone down here.
Call the police now.
What?
"As we forgive those
who trespass against us.
And lead us not
into temptation,
but deliver us from evil."
Stop. Put the body down.
I've already called security.
There's nowhere for you to go.
- Now, just stay calm.
- You don't understand.
Megan!
Megan!
Megan!
Get off of me!
Get off of me!
Please, listen to me!
- You've got to destroy her body.
- Get him up!
- You're coming with us.
- Please, listen to me.
- Listen. Listen.
- Are you okay?
You have to destroy her body.
You've got to destroy her body.
You don't know
what you've done!
You don't know what you...
She's not dead!
Stop.
Hello?
Megan, it's Andrew.
I just heard
what happened.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine, but I'm going
to have to call you back.
Hey, can you open
the door?
- Hey.
- Are you okay?
- Did that guy hurt you?
- No. No, not really.
- I'm fine.
- Do you want to call it a night?
I can find someone else
to cover your shift.
I'm okay. Seriously,
Lisa, I'm fine.
Nobody is going
to hold it against you
if you just want to
get out of here.
I know. But
I want to stay. Okay?
I can do this.
I want to do this.
- But you don't have to.
- Lisa.
I need to do this.
Okay.
What is it?
I know this is going
to sound insane, but...
I heard a corpse breathe.
- Breathe?
- Yes.
Like...
an exhale.
Corpses expunge air sometimes
when they're moved.
Dr. Lewis
didn't tell you this?
In his defense, he...
probably assumed
I was smart enough
to know that corpses
can't breathe.
Are you hungry?
I can get us some take-out
from the cafeteria.
- Sure.
- Okay, come on.
You know, when that guy
attacked me tonight...
my first instinct
wasn't to run.
You know,
I wanted to defend myself,
to stop him.
I didn't freeze.
Why couldn't
I have done that
when there was a gun
pointed at my partner?
And then none of this
would have happened.
Look, it's just
one step at a time.
This job is the next step.
- Hey.
- Hey.
There is a cop upstairs
who wants to talk to you.
I can cover down here
if you want.
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
- How's your arm?
- Oh, it's good as new.
Do you want some fries?
Um...
- Sure. Thanks.
- Here. See you.
You didn't have to come here.
They already have my statement.
Yeah, I know.
I was in the area.
Are you okay?
He didn't hurt you?
Just my ego.
Did you I.D. him yet?
No, he's not talking.
We'll know more once
we get him to the station.
You seem anxious.
Are you staying
through the night?
That's the plan.
I just know how you get
when you're stressed.
Okay, look, I appreciate
you coming here,
but I've got things covered.
Okay?
Is there something else?
I know this
isn't the right time...
but when I picked up my stuff,
there was something missing.
A bottle of Xanax.
And you're assuming
that I...
what, stole them from you?
Did you?
It's a valid question.
You're not supposed
to be around
controlled medications
of any kind.
You misplace a bottle of pills
and automatically assume this.
Why are you getting
so defensive?
I'm not getting defensive.
I'm getting pissed.
You know, it's as if
you're completely incapable
of giving me
the benefit of the doubt.
If you ever need my help,
I'm just a call away. Okay?
Actually, there is something
you can help me with.
I'll be right back.
Hey.
- How's it going?
- I'm good. How are you?
I'll just be another minute
if that's okay.
Yeah, no problem.
Take your time.
Bases loaded, three-and-two
count, down by three.
The stakes
could not be higher.
Here comes the pitch.
It's a heater.
It's a grand slam!
Can you run these
for me at the station?
The scanner broke down
before I could run her prints.
- Her?
- Hannah Grace.
You already have her I.D.
I think that I.D. is fake.
The picture
on her license doesn't match.
Her eye color,
it's different.
- What?
- Once a cop...
Just get me the prints,
okay?
You got it.
Dave?
I mean, seriously.
Dave?
Dave?
Hello?
Dave, is that you?
Are you sure you gave me
the right prints?
- Positive.
- The results are odd.
Why do you say that?
Because
according to the prints,
Hannah Grace has been dead
for three months.
It must be a glitch
in the system.
It wouldn't be
the first time.
Is everything else okay?
Megan.
Yeah, thanks.
Wait, what?
Hey, Dave,
where the hell are you, man?
Is everything all right?
- The security cameras downstairs...
- Yeah?
Can I access
the morgue footage?
I can't leave the desk
unmanned, but...
here you go.
Thanks.
Oh, my God.
Come on, Megan. Just breathe.
Lab Tech
Hernandez, please dial 1-6-6-7.
Hey, can I talk to you
for a sec?
Yeah. Excuse me.
So, I thought I saw
someone in the bathroom.
When I went to check
the security footage,
I mean,
I could have sworn it was her.
Meg, who is "her"?
What are you talking about?
I need to show you
something.
There.
What is that?
I don't know.
Well, I mean,
it looks like a shadow.
It's not a shadow.
Look,
when that guy broke in...
he kept talking
about the woman he killed...
Hannah Grace,
how she wasn't really dead.
I looked her up.
She died three months ago
during an exorcism.
You know I don't believe
in that kind of stuff, but...
...this, to me,
is not a shadow.
What is this?
Lisa, I didn't take any.
- Are you lying to me?
- No, okay?
You need to believe me
on this one.
I promise you,
I didn't take any.
I wanted to, but I didn't.
I've just had them in my bag
for comfort. I promise.
Meg, do you...?
Do you remember
when we were in meetings
and they started talking
about coping mechanisms?
Yeah.
An addict's brain
tries to find
new ways
to cope with stress.
Everything that has happened
to you today,
the stress
that it has caused,
your brain is desperate
to find a way to cope with it.
And it is going to do
anything it can
to convince you to use again.
My brain did not put a corpse
on the security footage.
Look, I don't know
what that thing is,
but what I do know
is you're jumping
to the least plausible
explanation.
And right now
you've got to focus.
So, don't see things
that aren't there.
- Here.
- No.
- Just take them.
- No.
I trust you.
Okay.
Dave?
Are you okay?
Dave?
Dave?
Intake bay.
I brought you a present.
- Can you give me a hand again?
- Sorry. I can't help you out.
- Not after last time.
- What? Why? What happened?
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.
Okay. Well, try me.
So, it's obviously
been a long night...
and I'm probably
just remembering things wrong.
She had a huge wound...
going down this side
of her abdomen
when you dropped her off.
Correct?
Yeah, I could have sworn
that she did.
So, where is it now?
And her arm was banged up
too, right?
Yeah. Have you checked
the admittance photos?
The camera broke down and when
I tried to scan her prints,
the scanner died too.
That's weird.
So, I had a friend
run her prints
at the police station.
And?
Hannah Grace,
she died three months ago
during an exorcism.
- Whoa.
- When that man broke in,
he said she wasn't
really dead,
and now it's almost like
she's healing herself.
Can I ask you
a personal question?
How personal?
Why are you working
the night shift at a morgue?
Because it's my job.
No, no. You're smart
and resourceful.
So, what happened?
You know what?
Actually, it's not even...
I'm sorry.
It's not my business.
I...
I had a rough patch
a few years back and...
I don't know, I guess
I thought I saw that in you.
I'm sure that there is
a rational explanation
for all of this.
You just... Megan,
you've got to be careful
that you don't
drive yourself crazy here.
I know.
He's adorable.
I used to have
a drinking problem.
And I would get drunk...
and lie and cheat and...
people told me
that I was a dick sometimes.
All the time.
And then...
this guy shows up...
and he made me want
to be a better person.
So...
I quit drinking...
I quit lying...
and then I was finally
able to be honest
with the people
that love me...
because I was finally able
to be honest with myself.
If you ever want to talk,
I'm the guy.
Thank you.
- Have a good night.
- You, too. Get home safe.
Intake bay.
Hey, I was just about
to call you.
That bottle of Xanax
that you were looking for...
I didn't take it.
Megan,
you already told me this.
I found it
in the medicine cabinet
after you moved out.
And I should have packed it up
with the rest of your things...
but I kept it.
I've just been feeling
anxious lately...
and I felt safer knowing
that they were there.
You know,
in case I needed them.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I'm tired of lying.
Anyway, I'll drop them off
tomorrow morning
if you're there.
Yeah, I'll be there.
I'm glad you told me, okay?
- Me, too. Bye.
- Bye.
Going down.
This is Randy,
drop-off complete.
Goddamn it.
Hello?
Hello?
Whoa!
Aah!
Randy.
Randy?
Oh, my God.
Randy.
Andrew.
Megan,
go to security right now.
The guy who broke into the
morgue killed the two officers
transporting him
to the station.
We have an APB out on him,
but there's a chance
he could make...
- Move.
- Megan?
Megan?
Open it.
Get the lift.
Do you see
what's happening to her body?
She's healing.
She heals herself
by killing people
and then she rests.
Why hasn't she killed you?
I don't know.
I believe you.
There's something evil
hiding inside.
The church...
said to walk away...
but I couldn't give up
on my only child.
That's your daughter?
Not anymore.
Hannah struggled
with depression...
anxiety.
It worked on her...
day after day...
till it broke her...
...found its way
inside her body.
Is that when her eye changed?
Yeah.
That's the demon's mark.
No matter how many exorcisms
they performed, it stayed.
One last...
...attempt.
In the name of God,
in the name of Jesus Christ...
our Lord, be gone!
You have to understand...
...I did what I did...
...to save the lives
of others.
But the demon
was too powerful.
It stayed.
The next day,
when we went to bury her...
...her body, it disappeared
from the mortuary.
Four people were dead.
We have to get her
to the incinerator.
The knife wasn't enough.
The only way to destroy
this thing is to burn her.
Anything else
just slows her down.
No!
Come and get me!
No! Stop!
No!
Stop!
No!
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on!
Mezzanine.
No.
Going up.
Arrived at mezzanine.
Officer Kurtz,
reporting a 10-65.
I need backup
at Boston Metro Hospital,
possible homicide.
Arrived at morgue.
Megan?
Megan?
Megan?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Fuck.
- Who's there?
- It's Officer Kurtz.
- Megan's friend. Where is she?
- Yeah, I don't know.
Dave's missing, too.
Everything's down.
What's going on down here?
Oh, God.
- Megan.
- Andrew. Oh, my God.
- What happened?
- We have to get out of here.
What the hell is that?
Come on.
- What?
- Oh, my God. Come on! Come on!
Hey!
Going down.
Megan!
Hey, stop!
Hannah, no.
No!
Let him go!
Megan.
Megan.
Andrew. Are you okay?
Okay, come on. Hurry.
We don't have much time.
- Go get help.
- Wait. What? Megan.
No! Help me, please!
I'm 62 days clean...
...and I'm thankful
for how far I've come.
It's not easy.
And I know I have
a long way to go...
but I'm feeling stronger
every day.
Nothing's
going to stop me now.
