Inspector Swart,
we've got the fucking scumbag
You're in deep shit, sonny.
Sister, perfume?
It's "the sweet smell of success"...
The good stuff.
It doesn't smell nice. It's fake.
Fake?!
Hey, boys. What are you doing?
Hey, boys! I'll get you!
I'll get you
Hey, you.
Give me back that hat.
Give me back my hat
That's what I call a car!
You're crazy.
I'm telling you my friend....
I'm going to have a 7 series, a BMW...
I'll park it outside my
nice beach house in Durban.
You wish...
You'd have to win the
lottery to get all that...
Nomsa, hey.
Did you hear I got
into Jo'burg tech?
To study computer science.
And you?
Have you heard from the university?
No, not yet.
What's taking them so long?
Hey bull.
You, go home.
See you later, okay?
Okay.
We had a shitty day...
We hardly earned anything.
Why is it that pretty girls
always have big brothers?
Hurry, a letter from university arrived.
My brother, I made it.
There's no scholarship.
What does that mean?
It means I have to pay my own fees.
Father, we thank you for
the little that we have.
Why does Zakes always eat here?
Why doesn't he go to home?
Shut up, you.
Thanks.
Stop now....
He's going to clean you out.
Just once more.
One more turn.
You lost it, because you're an idiot.
Hey guys, cool it.
Tomorrow.
Don't move, thug!
Comrade Nazareth, so it's you...
You gave us a fright, man!
"the cowards are running..."
What are you two up to?
- Let me go. - Nothing, man.
What's it to you?
So, tell me...
When did you get out of the bush, gorilla?
It's not gorilla... It's guerilla.
Get it?
You peasant.
Moscow, huh?
So how was Moscow?
Bullshit...
You said it...
Gents, let's get a drink.
You eventually decided to join the
terrorists because you say you
couldn't catch them, huh?
We're in the procurement industry.
You see, comrade thug here, he's a carjacker.
Here, poor-boy.
Buy yourself some food.
No, I'm fine...
Lucky, if you're looking for guidance...
...the bible is the book to read.
I'm ok, Mum. I'm going to sleep now.
Is that all?
We washed the taxi and shined your hubcaps.
Piss off.
Don't worry, great things
have small beginnings.
Are you still trying to
hustle money for university?
If you want to do a bank...
...you'll need an AK-4 7.
From Russia.
The browning automatic...
It loads fourteen rounds in the magazine.
Give me another one.
Take it...we can make a deal.
Hey fool...
I need a white Isuzu pickup...
Don't worry, sir...
We steal cars.
I don't care what you do with the guns...
...as long as you pay.
Keep up brother.
What's your problem?
What's your problem?...
I don't have a problem.
These sneakers are killing me
We knew this wouldn't be easy.
Stop whining.
Let's go home.
Hey guys...
Hey!
Fuck off...we're jacking you!
We're taking the car!
Please guys...
...I've got a wife...
...three kids...
...and a girlfriend!
Shut up!
Go over there! ...
...and count to one hundred.
Hey man let's go...
Start it! Start, start, start!
Push in the clutch, put it in gear...
I can't.
Why not?
Useless idiot...
I told you this was a bad idea!
Now we're in the shit
Ah but gents, I counted to 1 00.
Release the clutch gently.
Gently, gently.
Oh god, god of Israel,
send your angel...
Hey!
...Abraham.
Look man, please listen
...gently...gently!
...a car is like your girlfriend...
...you must understand her...
...you've got to treat her smoothly.
What's so funny?
You're speaking to the wrong person....
This guy is a virgin.
Fuck you...
Screw you!
How much pussy have you seen?
Going nicely...you're doing well.
Now push the clutch in...put it into second..
...change gears now...
Yeah, now put it in second...
See? I'm making sweet love.
See for yourself.
My boss is going to kill me...
You were hijacked...remember!
Here...here...
Taxi fare home...
And buy yourself a drink...you need it!
Now fuck off! !
What's this?
I don't trust these people, we want cash.
Today I got a job.
Really...
What job?
A good job...
...in the automotive industry.
It's good...
... Delivering cars.
Why weren't you at school today?
I quit.
And what about university?
I see you're the kind who
likes taking the easy way out.
You don't understand.
What are you reading?
Just a book.
Oh, adult literature?
Stop it, stop it!
...let me see, let me see...
come closer.
These guys really know their shit!
My friend, it's a movie.
It's not real.
Whoever made this flick
is a criminal genius.
A real mastermind.
Boys...
The scorpions are here
Where've you been?
Aunt Violet, what's happening?
Your Mum is in hospital.
Diabetes. She'll be home tomorrow.
Hey, scumbag.
Move it.
You look good in a uniform.
How much do you make in tips?
I hear you're reapplying to university?
Serious?
You can't quit from crime.
Crime is the biggest
growth industry in the country.
...private security is.
Last year it surpassed mining
My boy...
It's just a smash and grab...
Quick and easy, man.
No violence.
I helped you, my boy...
I got you nice clothes, food...
I never asked you for anything.
Today, I'm asking you...
...are you in?
And I suppose this will be my last job?
Are you alright?
It's not that bad
Put this on, tight!
Shit...drive...keep going!
Why don't we go to Durban?
You've always wanted to see the ocean.
How much cash we got?
Six hundred bucks...
Six hundred...after all that?
You know... Easy come, easy go!
Why don't we get lost in the
Jo'burg jungle, my friend?
Getting lost is the best option.
You are in serious trouble.
Worse than ever.
You will reap what you've sown,
I'm telling you.
I'm leaving.
Where are you going?
I just have to go.
Look after yourself.
Your talking shit, man,
it's these foreigners.
Yes, preacher man.
They caught it from your mother.
Hey hey what are you
doing on our route?
Fuck off!
What?
Fuck off you pirates!
You fuck off, bitch..
Watch it!
Watch it, you satan!
Hi Lucky.
I got you fish and chips.
Sleep in the car...
...anyone fucks with our taxi, honk...
...stealing from a working woman?...
...fuck you! ...
...you think I fuck for free, you bastard!?...
Fuck off, you swine!
Hey, can I sleep at your place tonight?
So you can rob me while I sleep?
Piss off, you've got nothing.
Hey, taxi crew...
...your rent's late!
Relax Gasta, you'll get your money.
Pay or else, I've got kids to feed. End of story!
What about your degree Lucky?
You don't even open them?
Hey man I'm tired.
I don't want to hear about school.
Zakes, Zakes ...
...who's there?
Nomsa.
Tell me, is my Mum alright?
She's fine...
She asked me to bring you these.
You and Zakes should
come home more often.
Whenever you come over this late
I think there's a problem.
I'm sorry... Nothing's wrong.
I wish sometimes you'd
come out with me...
You talk too much...
Since when are you an angel?
... My angel
Lucky, time to go...
What time is it?
Early, go back to sleep.
Treat Nomsa well...
A car is like a woman, remember?
I'm going to get some beers...
Don't forget smokes.
Take us to Alexandra.
I don't have time.
I'll give you one-hundred rand.
Leave me alone.
Inside motherfucker!
I'll blow your skull open and
scatter your brains like popcorn!
Heads we kill you,
tails we beat you!
Some guys jacked me.
It's gone.
How much money do we have?
Not enough for a taxi.
I need you to organise a gang.
A gang?
What are you planning?
Nazareth.
Why didn't you visit me in jail?
Nobody goes to jail unless they have to.
Anyway, a man must face his own music.
Now you want my help?
I gave these boys a free education...
The Hillbrow People's Housing Trust...
Will hold a meeting on Saturday...
Hello sir.
I'm Lucky Kunene...
The state lawyer advised me
to plead guilty.
Who's that?
Lucas Sithole.
Listen boy ...
I don't need any gratitude.
Hey man, let's get some more beers here.
This other man's grass
is definitely greener.
We're going to the shops.
Get me some beers and
buy yourself some sweets.
Check this out.
Look, you're the man ...
Hide that away, what if mama sees it.
These Nigerian guys are huge!
They are always pushing and shoving
They scored!
Where's Tony Ngu?
Room 31 1
You're full of shit!
Hey, Nazareth ...
...wait!
We shouldn't even be here.
I don't need this shit...
What's going with Nazareth?
Hello my babies!
...look how big you're getting!
What did you bring us?
Look ...
Schoolbooks...
... And uniforms.
Hey, boys?
Look what i've brought you.
What's that?
A rugby ball!
A rugby ball? I'm not a whitey!
I play soccer.
You play soccer?
How about a little muticulturalism?
Hello my babies!
Don't talk to her like that...
...dog.
Hey fuck you, man.
What you going to do?
Are you still serious about
moving to the suburbs?
You know what...
I've had it with living here.
You know what the guys
are saying?
...that it's not ok..
They say it's a betrayal.
Why should we be embarrassed
about being rich?
Those days are over.
Just because I'm a darkie ...
...doesn't mean I have to
live in the slums.
I'll live as I choose to live...
... And I fuck who I want
to fuck
... Forget about the girls
and just focus.
Vusi, get busy over there.
Lets go!
This is what I call the land redistribution,
via back door.
Fuck you, farm boy.
Go fuck your mother
We are the residents of Hillbrow.
If Lucky Kunene won't look after us...
...nobody will!
Go upstairs and get busy.
... Come here.
Cool.
Something from Mr Ngu.
I got all the guys still out looking.
Nothing.
Where would he go?
Anyone seen a whitey go inside?
Let's go.
Nothing.
We've looked everywhere.
The clubs...
The bars...
... All the joints.
The game is obvious.
Kill them.
I don't like this shit.
Then we kill Ngu.
A war's no good.
Ngu bailed Nazareth out of jail.
That's alright.
As long as we stick together.
Hey, Vusi...
Zakes is dead.
I'm outside the base.
Hey gents.
I've got white meat, black meat,
Wake up, hoodlum.
You got a visitor.
I'm ashamed of you.
Don't be.
You promised that you'd live a
Christian life
I don't want your dirty money.
Then take it for Isaak and Sipho
and Winfred and Thandie.
I brought you a bible.
The priest marked psalm 1 37.
Read it, I want to hear.
Hey,
It's too tight.
Hey...
Hey... it's too tight.
There, better?
He's sick... this is barbaric!
He's faking it.
Fucking crook.
Fucking crook, you don't know these people.
It's not visiting time now.
Listen here...
Even if you are the president...
I don't give a damn!
Understand?
I told him.
Be quiet!
Hey brother it's ok.
Everybody relax.
We can work it out darkie style.
Ok?
Lets work it out like darkies, brother.
