[instructor] Breathe in, breathe out.
On the next inhalation, raise your arms,
palms together at the top,
look at your thumbs,
separate your shoulders from your ears.
Exhale and open your arms.
That's it. Turn to look at your left hand,
the left.
That's it. Hold it.
Excellent, Alicia.
Good.
Align your feet, Leonora.
There you go.
Curve your spine.
The last thing up is your head.
Keep your eyes closed,
arms at each side of your body.
Relax your breathing.
Lower your blood pressure.
All right, open your eyes.
-[women] Mmm.
-[instructor] Very good, girls.
-Oh, it feels nice.
-See you on Thursday.
-Thanks.
-[instructor] Thanks.
-Thank you.
-[instructor] No, thank you.
-[women] Thanks.
-[instructor] Thank you.
[Leonora] Oh, I'm starving.
-[woman] Lovely class.
-[instructor] Thanks.
-Lovely class, very nice.
-[woman laughing]
[woman] I think so too.
[woman 1] The cheesecake is amazing.
-[woman 2] Can I have a slice, Alicia?
-Yes, of course.
[woman 3] You know? I think
I overstretched. I was showing off.
[woman 1] You think?
You'll feel much better next time.
Have you heard from Beba?
She went to New York with a friend.
-A friend who isn't us.
-[scoffs]
She hasn't stopped traveling
since her husband died.
[woman 2] I hope she meets someone.
-Can you pass me the cheesecake, Alicita?
-Oh, sorry, yes.
How's Ignacio doing?
Good.
[inhales]
He's still going to the office.
Oh, so he didn't retire?
[Alicia] Yes, but he's always
making up excuses to go in.
I prefer it that way,
it keeps him out of the house.
-[laughter]
-[Santi] Auntie!
-[woman gasps]
-Look.
How nice, is that for me?
-He's such a sweetheart.
-[Alicia] It's lovely!
-[Santi laughs]
-Thank you so much.
-Sorry, ma'am.
-It's okay, Gladys.
Go to the kitchen,
we'll put it on the fridge.
-Will you come with me?
-No! Well, all right.
[woman 1] Oh, he's so sweet.
And so cute!
[woman 2] He's so big.
But we haven't seen your grandson
in a while.
Little Martín is the same age as Santi,
isn't he?
Yes. Yes, they're both three.
Emma's turning three in May.
My daughter is going crazy
checking out preschools,
they're ridiculously expensive.
[woman 1] Yes, it's crazy.
My daughter-in-law says Malena's
preschool tuition is as much as college.
[woman 2] It's insane.
Tuition fees skyrocketed.
[water running]
-[relieved sighs]
-Look at this ball, Auntie!
-What is it, honey?
-Look at the ball.
[gasps] The ball!
Did you see how fat Eleonora got?
-Look.
-She's overweight, did you notice, Gladys?
You and I have to start dieting tomorrow
or we'll end up like her.
Yes, ma'am.
[Alicia chuckles]
Let's see, Santi.
[Alicia gasps]
What are you doing, Santi?
I've got the Play-Doh.
That's a beautiful drawing.
I'll put it on the fridge.
Do you want to come with me?
-Come, let's put it up on the fridge.
-[Santi] Yes.
-Let's put it here.
-[Santi] There, there it is.
-And what do we do with the Play-Doh?
-[Santi] The Play-Doh.
[Alicia] Do you want to watch cartoons
on the big TV, Santi?
Yes, let's go.
[Alicia] Let's go watch cartoons
on the big TV.
-Where did I put--?
-On this couch.
Oh, yes, let's watch some cartoons.
-[TV turns on]
-What is it?
Let's see... there we go!
-[gasps]
-I want to sit lower.
[cartoon playing]
Want to sit with Mr. Bear?
-Yes.
-Yes, here we are, with Mr. Bear.
-Auntie!
-What is it, baby?
I want to sit lower.
[cell phone vibrates and chimes]
Lower.
Yes?
[automated voice] This call
is coming from a penitentiary facility
on behalf of...
[Daniel] Uh... Daniel.
[automated voice] If you wish to accept,
press three. If you wish to listen to--
[heart rate monitor beeping steadily]
Doctor.
[woman screaming and sobbing
in the background]
[doctor speaking indistinctly]
-Doctor.
-Yes, I'll be right there.
[phone ringing in the background]
[woman continues screaming]

[gate unlocks]
[handcuffs unlocking]
Oh, Daniel, son.
[inhales]
Daniel, honey.
[inhales]
Oh, you're so thin.
[exhales] Here, sit.
[Ignacio sighs ]
Come on...
tell us what happened.
[Daniel inhales sharply] Marcela.
That's what happened.
She pressed charges again.
[Alicia] Why?
You said you'd been talking.
Yes, Mom, but you know her.
She promises to let me see little Martín.
I fall for it like an idiot.
[Alicia] Just like us.
How long has it been since we saw Martín?
-I try calling and she hangs up on me.
-[Ignacio] Wait, wait, wait.
Why did they bring you here?
[Daniel] What do you mean?
-Daniel, you were never arrested before.
-[Daniel] Well, that's why.
Since it didn't work before,
she pressed charges.
What did the public defender say?
What can he say? Nothing.
He's handling 80 cases.
Besides, he doesn't seem to want to work.
The thing is, I can't stay here
because of an idiot,
I can't afford a lawyer.
Don't worry about that.
Dad will call Roberto,
and we'll see what we can do.
Oh, you're so thin.
Are we allowed to bring you food?
[Daniel] Yes.
Yes, please do.
And bring me a pack of cigarettes
and a phone card.
[Alicia] Whatever you need.
[Alicia sighing]
Sweetheart.
Pereira.

Gladys, right?
All right.
Gladys, I'm Mr. Pedro Vieytes.
I've been assigned
as your public defender.
Are you okay with this?
-Yes.
-[Pedro] Good.
I'll ask you to tell me what happened.
You woke up in the middle of the night,
went to the bathroom...
and what happened?
Do you remember going to the bathroom?
I don't remember.
[inhales]
Gladys...
you've been accused of homicide
aggravated by kinship,
do you know what that is?
You could spend many years in prison.
I can't help you
unless you tell me what happened.
Silvia.
Silvia.
She's in no condition
to give her statement.
I'll have to ask to reschedule,
and I need a phsychological evaluation.
Look, the judge
wants to transfer her to prison.
Yes, I know,
but I can't do anything about it today.
All right, whatever you say.
LUCECITAS BILINGUAL KINDERGARTEN
[children chattering excitedly]
Hi.
[Santi] Auntie!
Hi.
Hello.
Hi, baby. Give me a kiss.
-Let's go, Auntie.
-Yes, let's go. Bye!
I love you so much, Auntie.
Hey, what do you want to do now?
Want some milk?
-Hm?
-[Santi] Taxi!
Let's see, taxi!
Call the cab, come on.
Wave your hand.
[Santi laughs]
[Alicia laughs]
No, man, the last time he was here...
about six months ago,
and I'm up to here with him,
I told Alicia, "Look,
there's something wrong with this boy."
[doorbell rings]
[Alicia] Gladys, don't use
the regular sugar bowl,
use the matching one.
Don't you know these things?
You seem woozy, are you pregnant?
No, ma'am.
Well, good. There's no room
for anyone else in this house,
especially not now.
Well, you know how it is, it's impossible.
Should I add milk, Roberto?
It's just fine, Alicia.
[Ignacio] Ultimately, what are the chances
of getting him out now?
[Roberto] Slim, not to say impossible.
[Alicia] There must be a way,
he hasn't even gone to trial.
He's got a previous charge
and a two-year suspended sentence.
[Alicia] What sentence?
Well, violation of a restraining order
and bodily injuries.
That stuck?
-[Roberto] It's right there.
-That's bull...
Sorry, Roberto,
but it's nothing but bullshit.
Hmm.
What we do know is,
with a previous charge,
if he's released and something happens,
the judge would have to assume
full responsibility,
so they'll make him wait for trial
in jail.
Did you see where he is?
The people he's locked up with?
-It's very dangerous.
-It's done, Alicia.
-It is what it is.
-What do you mean it is what it is?
God, how long will we have to wait
for the trial?
-I've known the DA for a long time.
-Mm-hmm.
I told him Daniel is my friends' son.
He'll make it a priority.
Sixty days and we'll have a trial.
You mean two months?
Alicia...
normal procedure usually takes
from six months to a year.
All right, then.
[mouths]
[inmates chattering and yelling]
[slurps]
Mmm.
Okay now.
Well...
Tell me about your family.
Here you go.
Drink up, it's warm.
[drinks]
Tell me about your mom.
She died when I was little.
[psychologist] How old were you?
Five, four.
Did you ever meet your dad?
Yes.
Did he raise you?
Yes...
kind of.
What do you mean "kind of"?
What's "kind of"?
Sometimes he'd go off into the woods
and leave me on my own.
[psychologist] Ah.
So you'd be alone all day?
Sometimes several days.
Several days alone?
And who'd look after you?
The dogs.
They'd bark to warn me if they saw anyone.
Wasn't there a neighbor, an aunt,
or someone to look after you?
No.
We lived far from town...
in the woods.
[sniffs]
And when dad was home, what was he like?
Um...
He'd nap with me.
And did your dad remarry?
Yes, but it got worse.
Why worse?
I had to take care of his kids.
I'd cook,
wash, clean, I did everything.
And how old were you?
Twelve or thirteen.
Gladys, how did you get to Buenos Aires?
A neighbor.
Mrs. Teresa bought me a...
she sent me here, to Buenos Aires.
She sent me with her daughter
to work as a live-in maid.
How did she do that?
Did she tell your dad?
No, no. She bought me a ticket
and sent me with her daughter.
And do you still see her daughter?
No.
You don't?
She got a boyfriend and moved back home.
Ah.
Do you have a boyfriend?
But you did date someone.
Yes, Gladys, you dated someone.
Who's the father?
Gladys?
[breathing heavily]
[horns honking]
There.
[judge] Mr. Daniel Ignacio Arrieta, 
you've been accused of trespassing,
carrying a firearm without a permit,
sexual assault and assault
causing bodily harm aggravated by kinship
along with violating a restraining order
against Marcela Sosa.
You'll be allowed to speak before a jury
and defend your case,
but there are three things
you should be aware of:
you cannot consult with your counsel
while giving your statement,
you can refuse to make a statement
without admitting guilt,
and the trial will proceed
even without your statement.
Do you wish to speak?
Yes, Your Honor.
[judge] Please, take a seat
before the court.
Before you begin, I need you to confirm
some personal details.
What's your full name?
Daniel Ignacio Arrieta.
Nationality?
Argentinian.
Your parents' names?
Ignacio Jorge Arrieta and Alicia Campos.
Marital status?
Uh, married... separated.
[judge] Separated or divorced?
Uh, we're not divorced.
[judge] Mr. Arrieta,
what is your profession?
Uh, I'm self-employed.
-What do you do?
-I'm a salesman.
What do you sell?
Uh, motorcycle parts.
What was your address
at the time of your arrest?
It was 484 García Lorca, department three.
You may begin.
Excuse me?
You may start giving your statement
regarding the charges that bring you here.
The charges are a lie.
Marcela hasn't let me see my son
for over a year.
She makes up excuses.
She's filed 23 complaints against me.
She's gone out of her way
to keep me from seeing my son.
And since that wasn't enough
to lock me up,
she set me up. She said...
She said she had to talk to me
about Little Martín, and I fell for it.
It's always been like this. She used
to cheat on me with her coworkers.
I told this to the other judge,
but he wouldn't listen and sided with her.
When we were married,
she'd always treat me as if I was useless.
I had...
trouble with my business,
financial troubles,
I had to close it down.
After that, I couldn't find a job,
and instead of supporting me,
she'd treat me as if I was useless.
That's why I started using,
because she was a junkie.
She'd give me money to buy her drugs
and I'd end up using.
Then that...
became a disease.
I turned into a drug addict.
Look, I never...
I never stole to buy drugs.
I come from a good family.
I was raised better.
But life dragged me to this,
to having to say this
in front of my parents.
I tried everything to quit,
I did counseling, but I couldn't.
Every time I started getting better,
Marcela would drag me down
with her abuse.
She treated me like garbage.
She'd say I wasn't man enough.
And she'd cheat on me with her coworkers
working late.
She had a night job.
She'd use that as an excuse,
but I knew she was cheating on me
with her coworkers.
And I'd use drugs to cope
with the hell I was in.
The marriage fell apart.
We'd fight...
all the time. She'd scream at me
to make the neighbors hear.
She'd even hit me.
Once, I tried to defend myself,
and she used that to file a complaint
and take my son.
I haven't seen my son since that day.
Since that day, she won't let me see him.
She turned him against me.
My son doesn't want to see me anymore,
he won't call me "dad."
Both of them, she and her mother,
they brainwashed my son.
And I got desperate.
I'd call her and she'd change her number.
I'd call her mom's
and she'd say she wasn't home.
I'd call her at work,
and nothing, she wouldn't pick up.
I reached out on Facebook,
sent her emails, texted her.
She blocked me.
So I got even more desperate
because I wanted to see my son.
Do you know how it feels
not to be allowed to see your own son?
So, I had no choice,
I went looking for her so we could talk.
She used that to say
I was threatening to kill her.
She filed charges. I went to court
and they gave me a restraining order
to keep me away from her
and my son, my own son.
On top of that, I'm paying the mortgage.
I couldn't get a job
because of the charges,
it was even harder to find work
being an addict.
I couldn't buy drugs, I hit rock bottom.
I thought of killing myself.
But then, she called, telling me...
that she wanted to meet to talk
about Little Martín, and I fell for it.
I fell in her trap.
And now, look at me.
I have nothing...
I don't have my son,
I'm destroyed, in jail.
[judge] Have you finished your statement,
Mr. Arrieta?
[cries softly] Yes.
Are you answering questions
by the plaintiff?
No, I'm not.
Then you may return to your seat.
Gladys?
Gladys?
Gladys.
It's late,
the girls will be arriving soon.
I'm coming, ma'am.
-[Santi speaking indistinctly]
-[footsteps]
[gulps]
I'm just saying;
she could've let me know, seriously.
Well, her daughter called
asking her to babysit her kids.
-Ohh.
-Good, the more food for us.
Alicia...
are you okay?
You seem worried.
Yes, I'm fine.
-The same issues as always, but I'm fine.
-Your daughter-in-law, right?
I heard she pressed charges
against Daniel again.
My ex-daughter-in-law.
-[woman 1] Mmm.
-She's making his life impossible.
[woman 2] I feel sorry for your grandson,
having to go through all this.
[woman 1] It's terrible!
But what happened?
This time he was detained, wasn't he?
And how do you know so much?
I don't, that's why I'm asking.
She's filed so many complaints,
the judge won't release him.
Jeez, there are so many women out there
literally driving their exes crazy.
Really?
They file complaints,
and the judge sides with them.
Of course, they use that to keep the kids.
Do you know how long it's been
since we've seen Martín?
-Over a year.
-[woman 1] Oh.
[woman 2] You could demand
to see him, you know?
It doesn't matter if they're in dispute.
As his grandma, you're entitled.
Yes, I know, but Ignacio and I
decided not to meddle.
-It makes things worse.
-[woman 1] Of course.
Bye, Alicia.
[Alicia] Bye.
-Bye, Alicia.
-[Alicia] Bye.
Yoga class is this Thursday at my place.
Oh, I don't know if I can make it.
I've got painters at my house.
Take care.
[Alicia] Yes, I will.
[judge] Please rise to take the oath.
Do you swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth?
Yes, I swear.
[judge] Please, take a seat.
Full name?
Ignacio Jorge Arrieta.
Age?
Seventy.
-Marital status?
-Married.
Profession?
Engineer.
Sorry, retired.
Your home address?
Uh, 1550 Posadas, sixth floor.
[judge] Do you know the defendant?
Yes.
How do you know her?
She's our maid-- She was our maid.
For how long?
Since... 2014.
Uh, February, 2014...
until now. Until it happened.
Does your relationship with the defendant
prevent you from answering
any questions truthfully?
No.
You'll now be addressed
by the District Attorney.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Could you tell us
how you met the defendant?
Yes.
My wife's friend recommended her.
We needed a live-in maid.
Uh...
And, well, we interviewed her.
She's been working for us
and living with us ever since.
[district attorney] By then,
she already had her son, Santiago, right?
No. No, little Santiago came much later.
Oh.
And how did you react?
Okay. My wife was the one
who noticed she was pregnant.
Gladys didn't know.
She hadn't realized
she wasn't aware of it.
And what did you do after he was born?
We pretty much raised him.
The thing is,
Gladys is a very simple person.
She's not very bright.
She grew up in the wild, in the fields.
But she's always been honest.
Even when some money went missing at home,
we never suspected her.
Not at all.
Not until this happened, you know?
How would you describe Gladys'
relationship with her son Santiago?
It was good. It was.
Yes...
My wife guided her
when it came to his education,
his upbringing,
she'd always turn to her.
[district attorney]
Did you meet the father?
[Ignacio] Yes.
A boy that worked in the neighborhood.
But as soon as he found out
she was pregnant,
he disappeared.
We didn't want to get involved,
you know...
I don't know. Those things are private.
Your Honor, the prosecution rests.
[judge] Thank you, Mr. Arrieta.
You may return to your seat.
[water sloshing]
[breathing heavily]
[door creaks]
[TV playing indistinctly]
Gladys.
Gladys, you forgot to leave a glass
in the bathroom.
-Where is it?
-Right there, ma'am.
We'll be eating out tonight, okay?
Yes, ma'am.
There's chicken rice in the fridge.
Gladys, this boy has a fever.
Draw him a lukewarm bath,
and I'll be right back.
Yes, ma'am.
Santi has a fever.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
But if I hadn't noticed...
I don't know what going on
inside that girl's head lately.
He needs a warm bath...
that should make him better.
What if we stay?
You're joking, right?
[Alicia] No, I'm not joking.
He's sick.
So? Let his mother take care of it.
[Alicia exhales]
[scoffs] We can't bail on Héctor.
They're our friends.
[Alicia sighs] Please.
Come on, Alicia, let's go.
No, I don't want to go.
Why?
I don't want them to start asking
about Daniel.
What does Daniel have to do with it?
Roberto opened his big mouth
because he's a gossip,
-and now half the world knows.
-It wasn't Roberto.
-Yes, it was.
-No.
It was me who talked about Daniel.
I'm leaving.
Are you coming?
Could you tell us
how you met the defendant?
We met about seven years ago. 
He and his family
were estranged at the time.
Actually, his dad had kicked him out
after this huge fight.
[inhales] I wasn't speaking
to my family either,
we hooked up instantly.
He was very charming,
and I was just a girl.
How old were you?
[Marcela inhales] He was 30, I was 22.
We dated for a while,
I got pregnant about a year later,
so we moved in together.
Actually, he moved in with me.
He had just closed his bike dealership,
he was deep in debt.
The plan was for him to get a new job
and help me with my pregnancy.
Time went by, Martín was born,
and Daniel never got a job.
So I had to cut short my maternity leave,
but still the money wasn't enough
for the three of us,
so I took a night job.
[lawyer] Did he help you with the baby?
He'd watch the baby while I worked.
But, to be honest, I had to take care
of everything after work.
I'd change his diapers, do the cleaning,
make sure there was food in the fridge.
He wasn't much help.
And he didn't seem eager
to find a job either,
even less so after he started using.
What did he take?
Well, first came his drunken binges,
then he started doing cocaine,
then he smoked crack.
That's when the abuse started.
He'd insult me, humiliate me,
sometimes even in front of my friends,
who suddenly stopped dropping by.
After that, he got this idea
that I was cheating on him
with my coworkers.
He'd call me a whore.
[scoffs]
Me, a whore?
I was working 14 hours straight.
I even had three jobs at one point.
And was it just psychological abuse
or also physical?
At first, it was just emotional abuse.
He'd spit at me,
make me sleep outside.
For example, if he didn't like my food,
he'd throw it at me.
His paranoia got worse with the drugs.
So I asked him to go to couples therapy
because I loved him
and I thought we could work it out.
He went twice.
That's it.
[scoffs] I ended up going by myself.
[inhales]
When money ran short,
he started smoking paco,
that's when the physical abuse began.
It wasn't so much when he was high,
because it would knock him out,
and I could still, sort of,
go about my life.
The problem was when he'd run out,
he'd turn really violent.
That's why I started giving him
money for drugs,
so he'd leave Martín and I alone.
[inhales]
I thought about leaving many times,
but I didn't have anywhere to go.
I wasn't speaking to my family,
and I didn't have any friends left.
Besides, there was...
so much abuse,
endless nights without sleep,
all at the same time,
I had no time to think about what to do.
I was in over my head.
I don't know how I kept going.
[lawyer] And when did you decide to leave?
[Marcela inhales] One day,
he ran out of drugs, and he went crazy.
He locked Martín and me in a room
and started hitting us.
He was hitting my son.
He told me he was going to kill us
and then himself.
At one point, he grabbed a knife,
and I realized we wouldn't come out alive.
So, when he got distracted,
I grabbed my son
and jumped out the window.
I had nowhere to go,
so a coworker ended up taking us in.
She helped me file the first complaint.
After you ran away with your son,
-did you see the defendant again?
-Yes.
He somehow found out where I lived
and would show up to threaten me.
He threatened to kill you?
Yes.
I lived in fear because I knew
what he was capable of.
So I kept pressing charges
until they gave me a protective order,
a restraining order.
But he didn't care. He'd show up anyway.
He'd say he loved me,
that he wanted to get back together.
He'd go ballistic every time I said no.
Did the charges you pressed
have any effect?
None whatsoever.
It got lost in red tape.
They wouldn't give me police protection.
There were no panic buttons.
It wasn't until he stabbed me
that they deigned to listen to me.
[lawyer] That's when you went to court
for the first time?
Yes, he got two years,
but a suspended sentence.
[scoffs]
In the end, the solution
was worse than the problem,
it made him even more angry at me.
And during all that time,
did you know what he did for a living?
-Was he working?
-No.
The neighbors told me
he'd coop up in the house
and sold everything.
I left everything--
some money I'd saved, the furniture,
two TV sets, everything.
He sold everything.
There was nothing left.
Would you please tell us...
-[deep breath]
-what happened the night of the attack?
I was coming back from work.
He grabbed me from behind,
threatened me at gun point,
and forced me inside my house.
I was terrified because they were
dropping Martín off any minute.
I just wanted him to leave
before my son arrived.
That's when he started threatening me,
asking me if I had been with Rubén,
a coworker of mine.
I didn't know whether to deny it
or play along,
he'd get angry either way.
And well, that's when between the pushing
and the shoving, he ripped my clothes off.
That's when he raped you?
Yes.
-And you didn't fight back?
-I did.
But he had a gun.
And truth be told, I just wanted him
to finish and leave before Martín arrived.
I didn't even care.
Luckily, he got scared
when he heard the doorbell and ran.
Had he stayed,
I don't know what would've happened.
-Thanks.
-[sniffles]
-That will be all, Your Honor.
-[deep breath]
[judge] Thank you, Mrs. Marcela Sosa,
you may return to your seat.
[Marcela inhales deeply]
[exhales]
[TV playing indistinctly]
Careful, it's hot. Blow.
-All right, eat up.
-[Alicia] To say he's a junkie?
Tell Roberto no, it's crazy.
No, what's crazy is to think
he'll be declared innocent, Alicia.
His only option is to plead guilty,
admit it, and say he was high.
But they have nothing.
It's her word against his.
They do.
Roberto spoke with the DA.
And?
And they have semen.
Yes, of course.
She seduced him for the rape kit.
Listen, Alicia.
If the semen DNA matches Daniel's,
plus his priors, he's toast.
Now...
if he pleads guilty
and says he was high--
My son is not a junkie,
and he's definitely not a rapist!
[softly] Keep your voice down, please.
[Alicia exhales]
[sighs]
We should talk to that...
that criminal lawyer, what's his name?
Héctor's lawyer.
[Ignacio] Whose? Hector's?
-Yes.
-Echezabal?
That's the one, Echezabal.
Alicia, he doesn't come cheap.
Ignacio, he's your son.
If we have to make an effort
or cut expenses, we'll do it.
I know he's my son, but it's not
about cutting expenses, Alicia.
Echezabal doesn't only charge his fee,
he needs money to grease some palms.
[Gladys] Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive--
Gladys.
Yes, ma'am.
When you're done, come to the kitchen.
I have your pay.
I'll be right there, ma'am.
[sighs]
[footsteps approaching]
Come, Gladys, please.
Yes, ma'am.
Sign here.
When you're done, count it, okay?
We're not sending our clothes
to the laundromat anymore.
-You'll take care of it.
-Yes, ma'am.
I don't want you going to the farmers'
market either. They're thieves.
-Yes, ma'am.
-I'll go with you to get the groceries.
I don't know where the money goes.
What were you doing?
Nothing.
Nothing?
My stomach hurts.
Ah.
Come, follow me.
I've told you already,
we don't do that in the city.
If you feel sick and your stomach hurts,
you take Buscapina.
Take 20 drops now and 20 before bed.
Let me know
if it still hurts in the morning.
Thanks, ma'am.
You're welcome.
[horns honking]
[footsteps approaching]
-[woman] Mrs. Arrieta?
-Yes.
-Follow me, please.
-Thank you.
[woman] This way.
-Mrs. Arrieta.
-[Alicia] It's a pleasure.
The pleasure is mine. Mr. Echezabal.
[Alicia] From what you've told me,
it seems there's nothing we can do.
I was hoping
you'd offer me an alternative.
This is a very complex scenario.
The case needs more
than just a legal solution.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
We'll lose in court.
We need to make them drop the case.
It won't come easy or cheap,
but it can be done.
How much are we talking about?
I think we could get it done for 400,000.
Four hundred thousand pesos, yes.
Dollars.
Some expenses
need to be covered right away.
Then, we can cover 50 percent
of my fees and the rest after it's done.
To be honest...
I don't think we can afford it.
-Don't worry, think about it.
-[Alicia sighs]
Work it out with your husband.
Hmm? When there's a will, there's a way.
We'll find a way.
Okay.
I'm here for you.
[Alicia] Thank you, sir.

Gladys, is that you?
Ignacio, wake up.
I heard noises,
and Gladys isn't answering. Gladys!
-Go check.
-I'm going, I'm going.
[Ignacio sighs]
[Ignacio breathes deeply]
[exhales]
Gladys?
Gladys?
Gladys?
Gladys?
[door creaking]
[dramatic music]
Alicia.
Alicia.
Alicia.
Thanks.
[man 1] Yes, of course, doctor.
Of course.
He must be three, four years old.
-[indistinct police radio chatter]
-[man 1] Hmm.
No, no, no,
I don't think there's a threat, no.
[siren wailing]
-[man 2] Did you write down all the names?
-[man speaks indistinctly]
Okay.
No, leave that blank.
The doctor has to sign it.
[man 1] So, you accept
temporary guardianship of the boy?
Yes, yes, yes, of course. Yes.
-[man 2] Write down everyone's name.
-[man 1] Okay, doctor.
I'll explain the procedure to them.
All right.
The day after tomorrow,
she'll be taken to family court.
No, please. Thank you.
[judge] Bring in the next witness, please.
Take a seat.
You've been subpoenaed
to this criminal trial 
against Gladys Susana Pereira
who is charged
with homicide aggravated by kinship.
Our clerk will explain the penalties
for giving false testimony.
Any person who gives false testimony,
denies the truth, partially or fully,
during their statement
made before of a competent jury
will face between a month
and four years in prison.
If the false testimony
were to incriminate the accused,
the punishment shall be
one to ten years in prison
and in all cases is grounds
for absolute ineligibility
for reinstatement
for twice as much of the sentence.
[judge] Please stand to take the oath.
Do you swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth?
-Yes, I swear.
-[judge] You may sit.
State your full name.
Esteban Alejando Palleros.
-[judge] What's your profession?
-I'm a doctor.
[judge] Where were you working
on June 1st?
I was on call
at the Buenos Aires Emergency Service.
[judge] Did you know the defendant
before that night?
No.
[judge] You'll now be questioned
by Mr. Vidal and the District Attorney.
[district attorney] Thank you, Your Honor.
Dr. Pachero, can you tell us
what happened the night of June 1st?
Yes, um...
I was at the hospital when a code red
was received from Recoleta.
It was about a woman who passed out
and was bleeding out.
Mm-hmm.
When I got there,
the owner opened the door
and told me it was her maid.
Could you confirm
that the patient was the defendant?
-Yes.
-Continue.
She was conscious, but in shock.
She had lost a lot of blood.
I checked her
and noticed she had given birth.
So I asked her where the baby was,
but she didn't...
seem to understand.
Her boss told me
she had passed out in the bathroom, uh,
so I went in...
and found the baby's body in the shower.
I checked it
and corroborated there were no vitals.
Please describe exactly what you saw
when you walked inside the bathroom.
Uh...
There was blood on the floor and...
with water all over the place.
There was a bucket and a mop.
It was clear
someone had tried to clean it up. Um...
The shower curtain also had bloodstains
as if it had been opened.
And behind the curtain, in the shower,
was the baby's body.
Please describe the body.
It was on the shower floor,
wrapped in a towel.
Can you tell us the cause of death?
Yes, he died of asphyxia.
It was clear it wasn't stillbirth.
You mean it was born, started breathing,
and was suffocated?
Yes, that's right.
Is it possible it may have been
a miscarriage or an abortion?
No, no, it was born, started breathing,
and was suffocated. It's in the autopsy.
Is it possible it could've been strangled
by the umbilical cord?
It wasn't wrapped around him.
There were no markings on his neck.
Thank you.
Your Honor, the prosecution rests.
[judge] Attorney?
You say the baby was wrapped in a towel.
Could you describe
exactly what you mean by that?
-He was wrapped.
-Wrapped, how?
Like this. Wrapped.
But was he bundled up
like something you're trying to hide,
or was he swaddled
as you would do to a baby?
Uh...
Yes...
-I don't know. I wouldn't know.
-Could you see his face?
Yes.
So, the towel was wrapped around his body
but his face was visible,
as when you swaddle a baby?
Yes, you could see his face.
All right.
You claim the baby died from asphyxia
-but had no markings on its neck.
-Mm-hmm.
[Vieytes] How was he suffocated?
The only plausible way
is covering the airways.
Good, by covering the mouth and nose?
Mm-hmm. Yes.
Couldn't it have been an accident?
I don't understand.
Maybe the defendant tried to silence
the baby so it wouldn't be heard,
and it was an accidental death.
You would need to ask her,
all I know is he was asphyxiated.
The defense rests, Your Honor. Thank you.
[man] Look, Mrs. Marina,
what worries me is a search.
The police have come three times,
not to mention someone from court...
Good evening, Roro.
Good evening, ma'am.
[woman] She kept the boy?
[man] I don't know
what's going to happen...
[chatting indistinctly]
[video game sounds]
[faucet running]
[turns off faucet]
[turns faucet on and off]
[Alicia sighs] He's finally asleep.
He has a really hard time sleeping alone.
He'll crawl back here by midnight anyway.
[Alicia inhales sharply]
Ignacio, we have to take
Echezabal's proposal.
We've been thinking of downsizing
for a while now.
This is the right time.
It's the only way we can save Daniel.
He should plead guilty.
[sighs]
If he pleads guilty, how will he cope?
How will we cope?
-I don't get you.
-After the thing with Gladys,
how long do you think it'll take the media
to find out our son is in prison?
I'm tired of covering for your son!
First, it was...
the 100,000 for the bar,
then the motorcycles, then...
selling the Arenales storefront
to pay off the dealership's debt
he saddled us with.
The only time... The only, okay?
We tried to be rational 
and refused to pay for his new car,
for God's sake,
because the one he had was perfect,
it was just a whim,
we didn't get to see Martín for a year.
You didn't want to give him the money.
He can't be driving a child around
in a car that isn't safe.
I'm tired of always having to have
my wallet open and my mouth shut.
I can't take it anymore.
I'm done!
Okay, let's just be done.
Okay, fine, let's end it.
We'll sign with Echezabal
and move to a smaller apartment, okay?
Do whatever you want...
but without me.
[scoffs] What do you mean without you?
I'm leaving, Alicia.
I'm done with this.
[Vieytes] Would you tell us
your specialty?
I'm a psychologist
specialized in infanticide.
-Have you assessed my client?
-Yes, I have.
How would you explain
why someone like Gladys,
a calm, submissive person with no priors,
got into this situation?
First, I want to make something clear,
these incidents always occur
under severe distress.
It often happens, as in Gladys' case,
that the mother
doesn't even remember what happened.
So, there are similarities
with other cases you've studied?
Yes, of course.
The main common factor
is that the mother convinces herself
the pregnancy doesn't exist,
so the birth will never happen.
In Gladys' case, she was born
and raised in extreme poverty.
She suffered from domestic abuse.
She's incapable of coping with motherhood.
In fact, her employer
raised her first child.
Her mother died when she was very young,
her father's partner
forced her into servitude.
On the other hand,
there was a very strong fear
of what another pregnancy could mean,
specifically the threat her employee made
about kicking her out
if it were to happen.
And lastly, there's a chance
the pregnancy was the result of rape.
[Vieytes] The defense rests, Your Honor.
District Attorney.
[district attorney] Thank you, Your Honor.
[clears throat]
Even if we were to accept
the reasons you've given,
couldn't Gladys Pereira have found
another way to fix her problem?
Even an abortion seems like a less
drastic solution than waiting nine months,
giving birth, and asphyxiating her child.
In Gladys' mind,
the birth was never going to happen.
She had given birth before.
She hadn't had a period in months,
she gained weight.
Didn't she suspect she was pregnant?
It's more complicated than that.
The stress of having an unwanted child,
along with the idea of being homeless
was too much.
For these mothers,
denial reaches such an extreme.
They may never have any symptoms,
grow a baby bump, or look pregnant.
You should know denial
is a natural coping mechanism we all use.
It's what keeps us
from feeling the anguish
of knowing we'll die someday.
Fine.
Let's assume denial 
kept Gladys from admitting to herself
she was pregnant.
Once she gave birth,
why didn't she put him up for adoption?
Even if she didn't want anyone to know,
she could've dropped him off at a church.
No, that wasn't an option for her.
Gladys Pereira is semi-literate
with a slight brain developmental delay.
Even being semi-literate
and suffering of brain development delay,
didn't it occur to her
that suffocating a newborn was wrong?
Again...
an unexpected birth in a woman
who didn't realize she was pregnant
causes a state of shock
capable of canceling out
any kind of rational or moral thinking.
[woman] And here.
And also here, Mrs. Arrieta.
-Are we all set?
-[Echiezabel] That's all for now.
Good.
I mean...
Uh, can she, Marcela...
appeal?
She could, but without the DNA sample,
I really doubt it'll stand.
POLICE DEPARTMENT FORENSICS LABORATORY
-What do I do with this?
-Whatever you want, it's yours now.
I advise you to destroy it.
When will my son be released?
I already petitioned for the case
to be dropped. It's a matter of days.
Thank you, sir.
[Echiezabel] Thank you, Mrs. Arrieta.
[children chattering]
[children yelling excitedly]
[woman] It's a very nice school.
-Are you sure you don't want some coffee?
-I'm fine, thanks.
Getting him admitted at this stage
of the school year was very difficult,
but luckily, I spoke to the principal
and it'll be just fine.
Frankly, I don't think it's a good school.
[woman] Well, it's a very good school
for him, all things considered.
Uh-huh.
This school has all kinds of families.
It's a much more diverse group.
That would really help him
avoid being stigmatized.
Right?
With everything
Santi is going through now,
I really don't want to change
anything else in his life.
Look, what he needs right now is a place
where he can freely interact
with his peers. Hmm?
-Yes.
-He needs to build bonds elsewhere.
Somewhere healthier for him, new bonds.
This is a beautiful opportunity.
A beautiful opportunity.
It seems to me...
instead of helping,
you're trying to get rid of him.
No, Alicia, that's not what it is.
We're... very concerned.
The entire faculty
is quite worried about this.
[Vieytes] Did you ever imply
to Gladys Pereira
that there wasn't room in your house
for another child?
I didn't know she was pregnant.
Still, you could've implied or suggested
you couldn't take in
a second child of hers.
I'm sorry, are you blaming me
for what she did?
What she did has no name, sir.
It's unforgivable.
Not even animals do it.
And now it turns out I'm responsible?
After everything I did for her?
When she first arrived,
she barely knew how to speak.
We educated her.
When she had her son, I raised him.
She didn't know she was pregnant.
When I took her to get tested...
she was seven months along.
Anyone else would've kicked her out.
I helped her with everything.
I raised her child,
I took him to the pediatrician,
I got him into a good preschool.
I'd even go to the PTA meetings!
She doesn't know how to behave
around people.
And now you're saying I'm to blame...
for this bestiality she did?
God!
After all the horrors I had to go through
in my home, my own home!
And the public shame she's put us through.
You still haven't answered the question,
Mrs. Arrieta.
Did you suggest,
mention, or imply
to Gladys Pereira that there wasn't room
for another child in your home, yes or no?
No.
The defense rests, Your Honor.
[judge] Thank you, Mrs. Arrieta.
You may leave.
Thank you.
What if we don't have time to cook?
It's getting late,
we won't be able to make
the milanesas we wanted...
-[Santi] Let's go, Auntie.
-Come on, Santi. Let's cross the street.
[Santi exclaims]
[Santi] What do I do?
[Alicia] Santi, come and help me
set the table.
And the cinnamon.
Hold it tight with both hands. There.
-Oh, careful.
-[Santi exclaims and giggles]
-[Santi laughing] Auntie!
-[Alicia laughs]
Make sure you don't drop it.
[Santi] I didn't break it.
Doesn't that milanesa smell delicious?
Mmm!
[Santi] I want to eat.
Here, Auntie.
Ta-da!
Well done, Santi.
I'm naming you the best helper
I've ever had in my entire life.
[Santi] There's Pedro.
-[Alicia] What?
-[Santi, mouthful] Pedro. The doll.
His mom came.
His mom.
Aah... Hmm.
All right.
-You still like being fed.
-[grunts]
[imitates munching]
[phone chimes]
-[Santi] Auntie!
-[Alicia] Can I see?
-[Santi] No. Auntie!
-[Alicia] I'll give it right back. There.
Santi.
-I want one.
-You want more milanesa?
-Not that one!
-[phone chimes]
You dropped your food, Auntie.
I dropped my food.
I'll cut this up and put it on your plate.
-Hi.
-Hi, Mom.
Oh, son.
[Alicia sighs]
-I'm so glad you're here.
-Is everything okay?
-I'm sorry for the delay.
-No, it's fine. 
I made milanesas.
-Milanesas?
-Yes, they're cold now.
-I'll warm them up.
-Awesome.
How are you?
Fine, a little hungry, though.
-Lucky for you, you're here.
-[chuckles]
Great, will you join me?
[Daniel] Coming.
Good riddance, Mom.
Dad didn't value you.
Besides, we should look at it
as a new beginning, a new opportunity.
-Hmm.
-A new beginning for everyone, right?
I hope so.
And I don't know if he had anything to do
with Gladys's mess.
This is really good.
I haven't eaten like this in a while...
real food.
[Alicia] Hmm.
-Would you like some coffee?
-Yes. Coffee would be nice.
You know, I've been talking to Chino.
[Alicia] Mm-hmm.
-[Daniel] Remember Chino?
-Yes, of course.
[Daniel] Well, he's restoring motorcycles,
you know?
I was thinking, if we could get 20
or 30 grand for the house, I could invest.
It's good business.
You buy a wrecked bike,
-you fix it and sell it as a collectible.
-Hmm.
With my contacts in the motorcycle
and parts world, I could make it big time.
I mean, Chino has an eye for it, you know?
But I'm even better.
I have a lot of experience.
Besides, it would be good for me.

[clerk] Please rise.
[people chattering]
[judge] You may sit.
Ms. Gladys Susana Pereira,
the law grants you one last chance
to speak before this court.
Would you like to say something?
Your Honor, my client won't be using...
[judge] Do you wish to be heard?
Yes, I do.
Proceed.
I don't know what came over me.
God only knows.
I know my life is meaningless.
I'm a lost case.
But Santi's life does matter.
He has to have a better life than mine.
I know I have no right
to ask her for anything,
but I'd like Mrs. Alicia to keep him.
[people murmuring]
I'd also like to apologize to Mrs. Alicia.
Many bad things were said about her here.
She was very good to me.
She's like a mother to me.
And to Santi as well.
Thank you.
[people chattering]
[judge] Thank you, Ms. Pereira.
I must make it clear
that this court isn't in charge
of deciding who'll have custody
of your son,
but we'll let the family judge
appointed to the case know what you said.

Bye.
Hey.
[Alicia] Hi.
-How did it go?
-He kept asking for his mom.
[Alicia] Really? Come here.
-[Santi grunting]
-Okay now.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Let's go find mommy.
-What do you want to do?
-I want my mommy.
Your mommy?
-Okay.
-Let's go find mommy.
Well, yes.
Want to see mommy?

I want you to smile a bit.

Done.
Put it here.
Then this?
Yes.
[guard] Two minutes left!
Thanks, Mrs. Alicia.
Thanks for bringing him.
Thanks for everything you do for Santi.
You know I love him
as if he were mine, Gladys.
Ma'am...
[Santi babbling]
Santi should be yours,
after all I did to you.
[Alicia] Don't say that.
I didn't know what to do.
He said if I told you,
he'd kill Santi and me.
And then, he stopped coming home,
so that was it.
Gladys, who are you talking about?
That time money went missing...
your son asked to come in.
I let him in.
That's when he grabbed me.
That's why Santi should be yours.
I owe you that much.
The baby was your son's, Daniel's.
[guard] Time's up! Gladys, let's go!
[Gladys] I love you very much, Santi.
Obey Mrs. Alicia.
[kisses]
Bye, Santi.
[Santi] Bye, Mom.
[somber music playing]
[Santi] Open the door.
-[yells excitedly]
-[Alicia] Slow down.
-[Santi] I'll get another toy!
-Don't run, Santi.

What happened?
Santi, what happened?
Where are you?
Oh.
[gasps]
[crying]

-What's wrong?
-[continues sobbing]
Oh, silly.
Are you all right, Auntie?
[continues sobbing]
[man 1] Come here.
[man 2] Wait.
-That goes to Juncal.
-Yes, okay.
[sighs]
Moving is such a hassle, isn't it?
Oof.
Have you spoken to Daniel?
[exhales]
No, no, no.
No, don't carry them together,
one by one, there's glass there.
You have to be on top of things.
LET'S TALK ABOUT SEX EDUCATION
IF IT HAPPENED TO YOU,
IT HAPPENED TO ALL OF US.
ASK FOR HELP
DON'T BE AFRAID TO PRESS CHARGES
NO MORE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
-Come in.
-Thank you.
Once she's served half of her sentence,
and if she behaves,
she'll be granted temporary leave.
-Eighteen years is so unfair.
-Yes.
Couldn't we appeal to reduce the sentence?
Yes, of course.
We will appeal, we always do.
But all we have is Gladys' new statement,
that won't be enough.
If it helps, I could testify.
But you already did, Mrs. Arrieta.
Unless you have something new to add.
Without any compelling evidence,
the appeal won't stand.
It's not easy.
It'll be tricky.

"WITH THE LAST OF HER STRENGTH,
SHE CRAWLED TO THE TOILET
AND THERE, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,
SHE GAVE BIRTH TOWARDS DAWN.
SHE SAYS SHE FELT VERY CONFUSED,
AND THEN,
FROZEN, BECAUSE SNOW CAME IN
THE SERVICE BATHROOM.
SHE BARELY HAD THE STRENGTH
TO LIFT THE CHILD.
AS FOR YOU, I BEG YOU,
REFRAIN FROM JUDGING,
FOR EVERY CREATURE NEEDS HELP
FROM ALL THE OTHERS."
