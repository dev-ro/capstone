  Livin' Iike this
  Did you notice?
  Now it's hopeIess...
Shane.
Go for Shane.
We need you upstairs
for a credit check.
I'm on my way.
  I'm afraid of
  Who I've become...
Hard pIay's over this way, baby.
  I'm too Iate to say
  What I've done
  Yeah
  Push it
  So that I wiII break...
- Hey, baby.

  BIow me away
  Did you say you were afraid?
  'Cause it's so damn easy
  I'm afraid of who I've become
  Yeah
-   I don't even know my name...
- Yes!
  I don't even feeI the same
  Yeah.
Which guy is it?
The guy who keeps
counting his chips?
- What's he into us for?
- At Ieast 10,000.
- What's the marker?
- He wants another five.
All right, l'll sign for it,
but keep him playing.
Ray, they're asking
for you at the door.
Yeah? And who is "they"?
Walter left a while ago.
Said he was going out
for a smoke
- and didn't come back.
- And they sent you to tell me?
lt's not like that, Ray.
No? How is it then?
l just wanted you to know.
Yeah, well, thanks for that.
  Feel the same
  Maybe l should give a damn
  But l don't know who l am.

  She's so smart,

  l play dada, you play mama
  She Mary J,
she don't want no drama
  Like a D.J.
l move the room
  Soon as l step in
l groove them
  I'm King Tut,
l'll take you to my tomb
  Come on, Nefertiti...
There you go.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
Thanks for taking over, Pete.
Oh, no problem.
Heard we needed someone
at the door, so l came down.
Seen Walter yet?
No. Been out here
for 10 minutes.
- GentIemen.
- My food's getting cold.
Why don't you go inside?
l got it 'til Walter comes back.
Okay. Do you want anything?
My dad owns the place,
I get comped.
No, kid, I'm good.
Can you grab my coat for me, though?
- lt's behind the bar.
- Yeah, sure.
It's coId out here.
Thanks, kid, l owe you.
You don't owe me anything.
Besides my dad,
you're the only person
that's nice to me around here.
l feel you, kid.
Hi, Mrs. Zello.
- You work here, don't you?
- That l do.
lt's the blue Z4.
No thanks.
Got my own ride.
Do you know who l am?
Do l care?
My husband signs
your paychecks.
Last l checked l was
on Vinnie's payroII.
Look, l have something important
that l'm late for,
so if you don't mind--
l don't mind at all.
Prick.
Hey, man, you got to
take that down the street.
I can't have
you doing that out here.
lt's a classy place, bro.
Come on, man.
Don't move, motherfucker.
Turn the fuck around.
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
- Turn around. Turn around.
Go go. Move move.
- Get in there. Let's go. Hurry.
- Move. Move Move.
lt's all good.
Just take it easy.
lnside now! Go. Move.
Hands down,
keep your mouth shut.
Do you know who owns
this fucking pIace?
Shut your fucking mouth
or l'll end you right now.
Keep moving.
Shut the fuck up.
Come on.
Let's go, guys.
Keep it calm.
Get her to open the cage.
Open the cage.
Oh, yeah, sure.
ls everything okay?
Yeah. Just open the cage.
Get in there! Now!
On the floor now!
- Let's go.
- Stay down. Don't move.
Stay calm and nobody's
gonna get hurt.
Shut up!
Get the goddamn
money now! Move.
- Shut up.
- Stay calm.
Just stay calm
and nobody's gonna get hurt.
Get the fuckin' money now!
Hurry up! Come on.
Hurry up. Let's go.
All right, big fella,
let's go. Come on.
You're gonna take us
right through the front door.
Hurry. Quick quick quick.
Open the door, big man.
Excuse me.
- Just be cool.
- Hey, Ray, l got your coat.
lt's okay, Pete, it's okay.
- He's got a gun!
- No!
Everyone get down!
Pete? Pete!
Pete? Pete?
Oh, man.
Lock it down.
Okay.
What the fuck, Ray?
You just Iaid there
like a fucking punk bitch?
That how you acted when
you were in the joint? Hmm?
- You take it in the ass?
- l locked it down.
- What'd you say?
- l followed the protocols you set up.
lf l had gone after those guys,
who would have watched the club?
- Say it again.
- Fuck.
You want every cop in this town
to waIk through
an illegal casino?
You want them to find all the Johns
upstairs getting their dicks sucked?
lf it wasn't for me
we'd all be going to jail.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
Half the department's
on the payroll.
You fuckin' believe this guy?
Clean yourself up.
I don't know, man.
l never saw their faces.
Ray Shane.
- Detective Landry.
- l heard that you got out.
About six months ago.
What's lnternal Affairs doing here?
Oh, l transferred
back to Homicide.
- ls that right?
- Yeah.
Yeah. Tired of putting
real cops in jail?
Hey, Slattery, l don't know
how long you've been on the force,
but Shane here
used to be a cop.
lt was Vice, wasn't it?
Back in the day.
And now you're running security
for the Marcella brothers.
l mean, ain't it funny
how things come around?
And by the way,
you're doing a great job too.
I hope that dead kid
wasn't a friend of yours.
What do you want, Landry?
l want the keys
to the Kingdom, Shane.
So why don't you
personally escort us
up to the second
and third floor.
You know what
l'm talking about.
Come on.
Finish that cigarette.
- Whatever you say, Detective.
- Good. Let's go.
A IittIe sIower
after that stint, huh?
You're movin' old.
Dirt all on your back.
Come on.
You know, big guy, l've been
waiting for this for a long time.
Yeah, l bet you have.
How long were you in there for?
Was it about five?
Yeah, something like that.
Must have been hard for a dirty cop
in there with all them bubbas.
No, it was all right.
I had your dad
to keep me company.
You'II want to Iearn
to shut your mouth.
Because if you say anything
about my dad again,
l'll kill you.
- Hey, Landry.
- Yeah, Shane?
l heard your dad gives
a heIIuva bIow job.
- No.
- Whoa whoa. Not now.
- Take it easy, partner.
- Ray, this isn't over.
Whatever, tough guy.
You okay?
Yeah, l'm fine.
l heard you got
into it with Tony.
Yeah, well,
luckily your boyfriend
doesn't throw
much of a punch.
- Tony's not my boyfriend.
- That's not what l heard.
Why do you say
things like that?
Does it make you feel good
to act like an asshole?
Who says l'm acting?
- l know you, Ray.
- Not anymore, you don't.
So why don't you go back upstairs
with the rest of the whores?
Dick.
- Yeah?
- Why did you say that to me?
What?
Why do you Iike
hurting me so much?
lt doesn't have to be like this.
How do you think I feeI
about what you did to me?
Tony? ls that what
we're talking about?
Okay, l was with him
because you weren't there.
- l was in prison.
- Exactly.
Look, every time
l try to talk to you,
you just walk away.
Well, then maybe
you should get the hint.
You know what,
will you just give me five minutes?
Just time to explain myself?
l mean it was a mistake.
lt should have never happened.
You're goddamn right.
Look, l got to go to work.
Me too.
Yeah, but you get to lie down
on the job aII day, don't you?
Fuck you, Ray.
Look, I reaIIy reaIIy
don't have time for this.
Shane, shut the fuck up.
Vincent's in his office.
Get yourself down here.
You're late. They started
the meeting without you.
Yeah, well, l got here
as fast as I couId.
We had everything under control.
How could you let this happen?
lt had nothin' to do with me.
You let this bum take care of shit.
He practically walked them
through the front door.
That's not the way
it went down.
This guy
you vouched for, Walter,
he Ieft his post a minute
before that crew hit our door.
- What's that have to do with anything?
- He's your guy.
When was the last time
you talked to him?
We been looking everywhere.
We can't fucking find him!
- That don't mean shit.
- His son's dead because of you.
Enough!
Do you know who this is?
CarIos sent him down. CharIie's here
to make sure you don't screw this up.
Do l get a chance
to tell my side?
Can't wait to fuckin' hear this.
l'm sorry about Pete.
He was a great kid.
But l did everything
l could to keep things under control.
So you ordered
the lock down?
Yeah, l did.
WeII, I think
that was a good move.
You protected the family
and our interests.
Fuck that. He should have been
stopping those guys
from taking over
300 grand of our money.
Why were we carrying
that much cash?
Money's not the issue.
l want you to find them.
l want this handled internally.
- Mr. Marcella, l can't do that.
- You were a detective.
You're used to finding people
that don't want to be found.
But with all due respect,
to work like a cop
you need access to information--
ballistics, criminal histories,
I can't get any of that.
Use your contacts in the department.
Use ours for that matter.
lf l show up at the precinct,
l'm gonna be as welcome
as the clap in a convent.
Fuck it.
l'll handle it.
No.
Blood demands blood.
You find the men
who murdered my son
and bring them to me.
- Can l get another Crown?
- Make that two.
You played it smart in there,
not letting that prick,
Tony, get to you.
You keeping tabs
on me, Charlie?
That's what they pay me for.
There you go, gentlemen.
So where'd you do your time?
Terre Haute.
How was it?
- Colder than this shit.
- Yeah, l know what you mean.
l did three years State time,
nearIy nine FederaI.
Nine years, man,
l would have lost it.
You know the best way
to do a Iong stretch?
Yeah.
Day by motherfucking day.
l can't ever go back.
ls that what you're afraid of?
l got a dozen guys out there
just waiting for me to fuck up
so they can send me back.
Vinnie's not asking you
to step over the line,
just play it close that's all.
l don't know, man.
AII right, Iisten to me.
Don't let Tony get to you.
He's trying way too hard
just to look the part.
Yeah. Prick's trying
to lay this shit on me.
Because we've
never been hit before.
Just trying to
cover his own ass.
What about you?
Well, they keep me around just
to eliminate problems for the old man.
Am l one of those problems?
Not yet.
l wouldn't even
know where to begin.
Sometimes you got to
think about what you saw
and then ask yourself
that question--
"What was out of place
when it all went down?"
Listen, l've got to go.
But if you need to find me,
this is where
l am most afternoons,
where l go to clear my head.
You be lucky.
Hey, it's Walter.
Leave your digits
and maybe l'll get back to you.
Can l do something for you?
Yeah. l'm looking
for a buddy of mine,
been staying here a month
or two since he got out.
His name's Walter Randall.
You seen him?
Not in a couple of days.
- Thanks anyway.
- You know, you ain't the first guy
that stopped by here
looking for him.
ls that right? You mind
if I check his room?
- Are you a cop?
- No.
Then, yeah, l do.
All right.
Hey, you find him,
tell him he's late on his rent.
lt's due every Friday.
lf he doesn't come back here
and pay up in full
in the next couple of days,
l'm throwing his shit out.
Yeah, l'll do that.
Hey, man.
How much you got?
- Excuse me?
- l overheard you, what you were saying.
- What's that got to do with you?
- Look...
l know where your boy's
staying, okay?
l'll tell you. l just need
a little cash, man, okay?
All right.
lf he's not where you say he is,
- l'm coming back for this.
- Okay, man, look,
he's at the this little
piece of shit moteI.
lt's off the lnterstate.
lt's... Lazy T. Lazy T.
We-- you know,
we got some H there,
we partied it up, man.
lt's all good. l promise.
You know the room?
25, okay? 25.
Hey hey, man, you see him,
tell him l've got some
really good shit, okay?
Thanks, man.
  This feels like a dream
  Grabs at someone unseen
  And l'm waiting
  And l'm waiting for the world
  l look but l can't see
  What's inside of me
  And l'm still
  Waiting on the world.
Walter.
Walter, it's Ray.
Walt?
Fuck.
Jimmy.
- Jimmy.
- What are you doing here, Ray?
l need your help, man.
l can't be seen with you.
Give me a call sometime.
Maybe we can talk.
- l called you three times.
- l've been busy.
Hey.
We were partners.
lt's ancient history.
You think you'd still be on the job
if l hadn't stood up for you?
They wanted
the whole squad--
lnternal Affairs,
U.S. Attorney's office,
goddamn FBI.
They all tried
to make deals with me.
They offered me
a walk if l testified.
Look, I appreciate
what you did, all right,
- but l can't do this with you.
- Five fucking years, Jimmy.
You know how long that is?
Well, l'm into something
and l need your help.
- You owe me that much.
- All right.
Let's go talk over there.
l got a wife and a new baby girl.
l can't do this shit anymore.
I don't want to see
pictures of your family.
They're the only reason
I'm stiII riding the desk.
You know,
Landry came down the other day,
said you were working
over at the House.
- Yeah, that's right.
- Listen,
y'all got some shit brewing down there.
l don't want any part of it.
Hey, you've got access
to everything I need:
interviews, witness statements,
the whole case file.
l need you
to show it to me.
l can't do that!
lf l get caught l'm g--
You weren't so worried about
getting caught back in the old days
when you were shoving
Vinnie's envelopes in your pocket.
- Keep your goddamn voice down.
- Have you seen the reports?
Yeah, l've seen them.
Is there anything
in there l can use?
Goddamn you, Ray.
The lab matched the slugs
from the shooter's gun
to a buIIet they dug out
of a murder victim about a month ago.
What good does that do me?
Homicide brought in a suspect,
they couldn't find a weapon,
they had to Iet him Ioose.
Get me the file.
Why are you helping
the MarceIIas?
Do you think l have a choice?
Get me the file.

l said what the fuck
do you want?
l need to ask you
a few questions.
- You got a search warrant?
- No. No.
Look, l just want to
ask you a few questions.
What the fuck you doing
in my goddamn house?!
You broke my fucking door!
l'm just gonna
ask you a few questions.
- You ain't got no search warrant.
- I'm not a cop.
- Oh, you're not a cop?
- No. l just need to ask you a few--
Fuck yeah,
motherfucker!
Yeah, you broke into
the wrong house today.
Fuck is wrong with you,
breaking into my house?
Broke into
my motherfuckin' house.
Yeah, motherfucker.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, getting dirty.
- l work for the Marcellas.
- So what? Get off me.
Someone robbed their place
and used your gun
- to kiII the owner's son.
- l heard about what happened.
- l had nothing to do with it.
- You were picked up
on a murder charge
two weeks ago.
- That charge's been dropped.
- Well, what did you do with the gun?
A motherfucker named
Scooby got that gun.
- White guy or bIack guy?
- White boy, buys coke from me.
He came over here about a month ago,
said he needed a piece.
- Where's he live?
- Man, l ain't no motherfuckin' snitch.
You're gonna
tell me where he lives!
You're gonna tell me
where he Iives
or l'm gonna go back
to the Marcellas
and tell them that you were
invoIved in the robbery.
And you know
what that means?
They're gonna come
looking for you!
So you're gonna tell me
where he Iives.
A'ight.
Shit.
Let's go.
Big fucker, let's go.
That's it right there,
707, second door. 707.
- Which car is his?
- l showed you where he live.
That's it. l'm done.
You tell the Marcellas
l had nothing to do with it.
- What?
- You tell anybody about me,
l'm gonna make sure everybody
knows you ratted your boy out.
Let go.
Who are you?
l'm a friend of Scooby's.
You look like a cop.
Yeah, l hear that
all the time. ls he home?
Scooby ain't here.
He's dead.
Last night he was
standing on the street
waiting for a ride
and somebody shot him.
- HeIIo.
- Jimmy, it's Ray.
You're calling me at home?
My famiIy's here with me.
- Yeah, well, good for them.
- What do you want?
I need you to puII
a rap sheet for me
on a guy named
Lawrence Salazar.
It's a IittIe Iate for that.
l can do it in the morning.
l need it now.
Meet me in the motor pool
basement in an hour.
- Jimmy.
- God damn it.
You scared
the fucking shit out of me.
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, l got it.
This is it though, Ray.
I mean it.
Don't ask me
for anything else.
Salazar runs
a pretty tight crew.
Their sheets are a mile long.
One of his buddies
has a spider tattoo.
A lot of guys
in this town have them.
l busted this guy--
DyIan SyIvester.
You know him?
lt looks like Fritz and l picked
him up nine years ago.
Son of a bitch.
We popped SaIazar
two years later on a dope charge.
Kind of strange, huh,
you knowing the guys
that tried to put
a bullet in your head?
Hey, you gonna tell the greasers that
you know two of the hold-up men?
lt's not like we were
drinking buddies.
Why don't you tell them
about it then?
That's what l thought.
l'm out of this, Ray.
I mean it.
Don't call me again.
- How old is your daughter?
- Why?
You want her to grow up
without a father?
- You're threatening me?
- Remember the old days, Jimmy?
WeII, I'm deep into this
and the statute of limitations
on the shit we did
hasn't run out.
lf l go down,
l'm taking you with me!
Fuck you, asshole!
lt's been a long time, Detective.
Yes, it has.
You got 60 seconds.
l want Ray Shane
off my back.
Too fuckin' bad for you.
l know you got Shane out
Iooking for the guys
that took you off
the other night.
As far as l know, the police
are investigating that.
Stop pulling my dick, Tony.
You know Ray knows
two of the shooters?
One of them's dead
and he's out looking
for the others.
ls that right?
And your doorman, Walter,
he was found with his throat slit
in a moteI on Division.
The maid spotted someone
leaving that very room
that matched
the description of Ray Shane.
Who else knows about this?
l want Ray Shane
out of my life.
Look, I know how badIy
your business was impacted
by this unfortunate event.
Shut down your brotheI
and casino for how many nights now?
What'd that cost you?
l expect that this will be
filled by next time we meet.
You trust this cop?
He rode Vice with Shane.
He knows how he thinks.
- So why's he telling us?
- He needs the cash.
Figures if he seIIs us inteI,
he can get back on the payroll.
If Shane set this up, why's he got
to lean on his old partner for help?
He's just tying up loose ends.
Listen, if we don't jump
into this now,
we're gonna have no one Ieft
to connect him to the robbery.
l brought that man
into this House.
I took him when
no one else would.
- l trusted him.
- We aII did.
Bring him in.
- How you doing, Ray?
- What the fuck do you want?
Vincent wants to know
why you took our money
and why you killed his son.
What the fuck
are you talking about?
Killing Pete was stupid.
Taking the money--
what the fuck were you thinking?
l didn't have anything to do with it,
and you fucking know it!
That's what
l thought you'd say.
Fuck you.
lt wasn't me.
BuIIshit. I didn't have
anything to do with it.
I know you know
who the shooters are!
l was a cop! That connects me
to every scumbag in the city.
l knew you were
a piece of shit
the second Vincent brought you in.
Once a dirty cop
always a dirty cop.
Always looking out
for number one, hmm?
- Right or left, Ray.
- What?
Your call.
Jenny.
Jesus, Ray.
What are you doing here?
Can we go inside?
God, you Iook Iike
you got hit by a truck.
Yeah? Well, that's 'cause
your boyfriend decided
- to use me as a punching bag.
- You know what?
lf you're gonna talk to me like that,
you can Ieave right now!
- I'm sorry.
- Stay right there.
Well, this place
sure has changed.
Yeah well, it's mine now.
l didn't really like your furnishings
anyway. Here, try that.
Want a beer?
- Yeah.
- Oh God.
There you go.
So what happened, Ray?
- Huh?
- Vinnie thinks l set up the robbery.
He sent Tony and Joey
to work me over.
- Did you?
- Did l what, set up the robbery?
- Yeah. Did you?
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No.
- How can you even ask me that?
You were there.
You know what happened.
This is crazy.
lt doesn't make sense.
lt's too connected.
You know what?
You just need to get
as far away
from here as you can.
But where am I gonna go? I'II be the
prime suspect in at least two murders.
And if l leave now, l'll spend the rest
of my Iife Iooking over my shouIder.
So if you stay,
they'll kill you.
I did my time.
l can't live like that.
- You're smart. You're really smart.
- l'm not running.
- Who is it?
- lt's Tony. Open the door.
Shit.
Hold on.
Goddamn it.
Be there in a minute.
Let me put something on.
Open the fuckin' door!
- What do you want, Tony?
- Let me inside.
Take the chain off.
No. The last time l did,
you just fucked
a Iot of shit up.
- Take the chain off.
- What do you want?
- l want to talk to you.
- Do you?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Say what you have to
say right there.
- Don't get smart. Just let me in.
- Hey!
Let me inside.
You seen Shane?
No, l haven't seen him.
You think he would
come here? Huh!
- Let me inside.
- Don't!
No. Do you want me
to caII the cops?
I'II caII the cops.
Here. You want it, huh?
- You ready?
- Fuck you. l'll deal with you later.
Oh, big shot, big shot.
Fucking piece of shit.
Thanks, Ray.
Thanks a Iot.
God damn it.
- There you go.
- l can't believe you kept this.
Goodwill wouldn't take it.
Besides, l used it
to wash my car.
Do you ever wonder
where we'd be
if we hadn't messed up
our Iives so badIy?
Yeah, every day.
Did you mean
what you said earlier
about not running away
this time?
What else can l do?
You can be honest
with yourself.
Just admit that
you are who you are
because of all
the choices you've made.
Practically the minute
l got my prison sentence
you went back
to being a hooker.
l wasn't a hooker.
I was a caII girI.
And l stopped
when you got out
because of you, lunkhead.
Besides, you were
a crooked cop.
You got paid
to look the other way,
and that was
the choice you made.
Those are
the choices l made.
And, basically,
that was how
we got ourselves in this mess.
- Heya.
- New wheels?
Yeah, something like that.
l heard you got yourself
into a bit of a jam.
Yeah, it's become a habit.
Yeah, weII,
you don't know the half of it.
Ray, Ray, Ray, relax. Sit down.
l'm not here to whack you.
Well, not yet anyway.
Doesn't sound
very reassuring.
But just so you know,
if the old man gets involved
there's nothing l can do.
l need your help, Charlie.
Look, Ray, l like you.
So please do me a favor--
you did not hear this from me.
Tony Zello's been playing
the back channeIs.
He wants Vinnie out of the way and
he's gonna use the robbery to do it.
How?
Well, Vinnie put you in charge of
security. That used to be Tony's job.
And if it looks like you set up
the robbery, weII then--
Vinnie's out
and Tony takes over.
Yeah.
AII I'm saying to you is
don't underestimate Tony.
He would do whatever it takes
to get what he wants,
including pimping his wife out.
Yeah.
Every Wednesday night
she meets the old man
after hours and they go out
to his estate on Reeds Lake.
Why is Carlos
messing around with her?
Well, she's young and she's
good Iooking, isn't she?
You know, as long as Priscilla
takes care of him,
then the oId man's
gonna watch Tony's back.
You think he'd listen to me
if I went to him in person?
He's a reasonable man.
But to be honest with you,
it's gonna be Iike--
it's gonna be
like going to court.
You're gonna have to
make a really good case.
And the best way to do that
is to prove to him
who really set this up.
l'm telling you,
if you can find the cash
and you can find the shooter,
well, then the rest
will fall into place.
l'll see you around.
- Who is it?
- Maintenance.
What do you want?
One of your neighbors
smacked into your car.
l don't have time
to fuck around.
You got one chance
to answer my questions.
Fuck you!
ln a minute you're gonna
feel some real pain.
Who else was a part of your crew?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Next time you lie to me
I'm gonna bIow
your fucking head off.
- I'm the onIy one Ieft.
- Where are the others?
- Dead.
- What were their names?
One guy was named
Eddie Teasedale.
The other guy
we called Wop.
Scooby said he had
a man on the inside.
lt was supposed to be an easy score.
Shit was aII arranged, man.
All we had to do was just come
and make it look real.
- What happened to 'em?
- They set up a meet for us
to drop off the cash.
When we got there all hell broke loose.
Who was it?
l didn't see any faces.
- lt was too dark.
- You're going back with me.
l ain't talking to no cops!
You got a lot of nerve
interrupting my dinner.
lt's business.
Why don't you two go
and powder your noses?
l don't need
to powder my nose.
Go take a piss, get a drink,
whatever. Give us a minute.
Sit down.
Now what's
so fucking important?
Some guy called me today,
said he saw Shane and Charlie Blackstone
taIking at 4th Street Park.
Who made the call?
Just some guy who's
into me for a thousand.
CharIie's worked
for me for a long time.
He got no business
talking to Shane.
What do you want me to do?
Listen, l got to head out
for a little bit.
l won't be too long.
- You ready?
- Yeah, l'm ready.
So where's
your other guy, Joey?
He's just taking care
of some shit. Let's go.
I thought you said
that guy's supposed to be here.
That's what they told me.
- Who's "they"?
- Fuck, does it matter?
This kid has
information on Shane.
Here's the guy now.
l trusted you, Charlie.
Considered you a stand-up guy.
No!
You been seeing Shane
behind our backs.
That's fucking bullshit
and you know it.
Charlie, quiet. No one can
fucking hear you out here.
.22 caliber, hurts like a bitch.
l once saw a guy
take 1 1 rounds
before he begged me
to kill him.
You tell me where he is,
I'II make it quick,
l promise.
You can do whatever
you fucking want,
because l got nothing
to give up.
Joey, how do you feel
about fucking this man's wife?
Fuck you!
Tell me where he is!
- Tell me where he is.
- You've just got to be patient,
because he's coming
for you... soon!
Clean that shit up.
Yeah, give me Detective Lagrange,
Jimmy Lagrange.
lt's Ray Shane. Trust me,
he'll know who it is.
Where are you, Ray?
Jimmy, l'm in big trouble, man.
You got to meet me
down at Fairfax--
You got some fucking baIIs,
calling me after what you did.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, we're aII here
looking at your handiwork
over at Charlie Blackstone's.
Did you have to kiII
the wife, Ray? Seriously?
- HoIy shit.
- Was she getting in your way too?
You got to believe me.
Jimmy, I didn't have
anything to do with that.
l swear, man, l didn't have
anything to do with that.
Well, ain't that interesting, 'cause we
got an eyewitness who caIIed in,
says he saw you
with Blackstone earlier today.
And we got your
blood-stained pocket knife
laying right beside
the oId Iady.
Jimmy, this ain't right, man.
Someone's-- this ain't right.
- Jimmy, is that him?
- Yeah, its him.
- He called in from a payphone.
- Give me the phone. Now!
We got a trace on it.
- Keep him talking.
- l got it. l got it.
- Ray?
- Don't believe any of this shit.
You listen to me.
l'm gonna give you
one chance, okay?
lf you don't come in right now,
there is gonna be nothing
that is gonna get in my way
from personally strapping you
to the eIectric chair.
- Do you hear me?
- Fuck.
Ray?
Find him!
Oh no.
Hello?
Jenny, you got to get out
of your apartment now!
What? Ray, what are
you taIking about?
Just get out now!
Leave everything! Just go!
Meet me at the Riley
in 10 minutes.
Just get out now! Go!
You've gotta fill me in, Ray.
What's happened?
What's going on?
l found one of the shooters.
A guy named Dylan Sylvester.
He told me that someone
from inside the House
- set up the robbery.
- Who?
- He didn't know.
- There were four guys there, right?
Dead, they're all dead. He said
they showed up to exchange the cash
and somebody opened fire on 'em.
He's the only one that got away.
Okay, so where is he now?
Can't you go to the cops?
l tried. l tried.
Everything's leading
back to me.
What about Charlie?
Doesn't he have
an in with Carlos?
Charlie's wife was
murdered tonight.
He's probably not
far behind.
Charlie told me
the onIy way
to cIear my name
with Vinnie and the old man
was to get the cash
and the shooters,
and the shooters are all dead.
l got to find that money.
Fuck.
What?
l ordered you a whiskey, neat.
Hmm. l gotta say,
l was surprised
to hear from you.
A girl can change
her mind, can't she?
Where you been?
You haven't been
at work in days.
l quit.
Decided it was time
to move on to something new.
ls that right?
- Maybe l can help you.
- Maybe you can.
Hmm.
Coffee.
You still looking for Ray?
What do you know about it?
l know he fucked me over
Iike he did you.
I don't owe him
a goddamn thing,
but in 15 minutes
my phone is gonna ring
and my friend on the other line
is gonna tell me
exactly where he is.
Who's this friend of yours?
She's a nurse.
Apparently you
roughed him up pretty hard
the other night
'cause she patched him.
Supposed to drop off
painkillers sometime
later this afternoon.
Where?
What's it worth to you?
You got my attention.
This is a waste of my fuckin' time.
Call me after you speak
to your friend.
l still haven't heard a price.
2500, if it's legit.
Let's make it an even five
and you have a deaI.
Hmm. For 5,000,
you gotta put something
sweet into the pot.
2500 it is.
Huh.
Rachel?
Jenny, Tony's in on it.
You got to get out
of there now.
Really? What time?
l've got take a chance
and go to Carlos.
Yeah. You did good.
What she say?
Where's my money?
  Caught in the thick of it
  Eye in the pyramid
  Force fed and sick of it
  Caught in the thick of it

  And they're scanning
all the databases
  Hunting terrorists

  But maybe
they're the terrorists
  Yes, they're making lists
  Are you interested?
Oh.
Ooh damn.
- Ah!
- What the fuck?
No. No. No.
No, l'm not here
to hurt anyone.
l'm not here to hurt
anyone, aII right?
I just need you
to listen to me, okay?
l just want to talk.
l just want to talk.
- Just hear me out.
- What are you doing?
The man's got a gun,
wants to talk.
l suggest we listen.
Everybody just be cool.
Just hear me out.
You pull a gun on me, kid,
you better have something
motherfucking important to say.
All right. All right.
AII right.
Look at that.
Open that up.
What's this?
lt belongs
to her husband.
He smokes. So do I.
So do you. So fuckin' what?
No, the Lazy T Motel, room 25.
I found that
in Tony's car today.
That's where him and his boys killed
Walter and left him for the police.
He was the missing doorman
at the House the night it got robbed.
- And you can prove this?
- No, not yet.
Look, l know
what you've been told
and, believe me,
the last place that anybody
who had anything to do
with this robbery would want to be
is right here,
standing in front of you.
l can't believe you're
taking this shit seriously.
Dylan Sylvester was
one of the shooters.
He told me it was an inside job.
Somebody from inside
the House set up the robbery.
- Yeah, it was you, you son of a bitch!
- Shut the fuck up. Go on.
l don't wanna spend
the rest of my life looking
- over my shoulder, Mr. Marcella.
- A Iot of guys wouId have.
Maybe if they had
an extra 300 grand
in their pocket, but l don't.
Charlie told me that her husband
was pimpin' her out to you.
That way you'd be distracted
while he tried
to take over Vinnie's spot.
- You shut the fuck up!
- WeII, you teII me,
who authorized us to carry
300 grand
the night we got hit?
Vinnie said it was Tony's idea.
Think about it.
Think about it, Carlos.
l was head of security and l had
no idea we had that much cash on hand.
lf l'd known, l'd have had security
all over that place.
- You're a fuckin' Iiar!
- You search their houses, their cars.
l'd bet my life
that you find that cash
or at least something else that
proves that they did it.
No! No!
91 1 . What is your emergency?
Yeah.
l was out walking my dog
and l heard gunshots.
Where are you calling from, sir?
lnterstate 96.
The Marcella house
on Reeds Lake.
Sir, may l please have your name?
- Hello.
- Meet me at the House, Jimmy.
Ray, l told you l don't wanna be
involved in this.
CarIos is dead.
You'd better meet me now.
  Oh my God, please tell me
  What you see
  Losing patience
  Too helplessly
  Can you tell me
  Where l went wrong?
  l can't help myself
  l'm too far gone
  No one here to help me
  Too far gone
  No one left to try
  Too far gone
  Shattered into pieces
  Too far gone
  Look me in the eyes
  Too far gone
  Fucked up is my life
  l live each day
  Taking chances
  When it comes my way
  Know l'm the black sheep
  l'm your broken son
  l can't help myself
  l'm too far gone
  No one here to help me
  Too far gone...
South 62, I've got
that homicide suspect.
He's northbound past Weston
in the aIIey east of Ionia.
  Too far gone
  Look me in the eyes
  Too far gone, no!
  No! No!
  Too far gone...
South 64, do you copy? Over.
Go for Landry.
Blackstone homicide suspect's
been spotted northbound,
aIIey east of Ionia.
Wearing blue jeans,
a leatherjacket and a cap.
Copy. Get me eyes on him now.
  Shattered into pieces
  Too far gone
  Look me in the eyes
  Too far gone
  No one here to help me
  Too far gone
  No one left to try
  Too far gone
  Shattered into pieces
  Too far gone
  Look me in the eyes
  Too far gone.
- What the fuck?
- Don't even think about it.
Don't even think about it.
BaIIsy fuckin' move,
you breaking in here.
- Easy. l just wanna talk.
- Fuck you, Shane. You killed my son.
l didn't have anything to do
with Pete getting killed.
Tony said you knew
the guys who did it.
I arrested those scumbags
years ago when l was a cop,
which means absolutely nothing
unIess you're trying
to frame me
for something l didn't do.
- Tony said--
- Tony set the whole thing up!
Why was there so much cash
in the counting room?
- We were expecting a big crowd.
- And whose idea was it
- to have that much money on hand?
- Tony said we'd need extra.
That's because he had
four guys coming in to rip you off.
Tony wants your brother
to get rid of you
so he can run the House.
Vinnie, Tony's wife killed Carlos
over an hour ago.
Don't you see
what's going on?
lf Tony makes it look like
I set this whoIe thing up,
then l get whacked!
And maybe you get whacked too
depending on how he plays it.
Either way he ends up
running this pIace.
And he gets to keep
the cash as a bonus.
You got it figured out,
don't you, Shane?
You're Iike a fucking
pitbull in a dog fight--
you dig in, you don't let go.
- You son of a bitch.
- Ray!
Put the bag down.
Ah-ah!
No escape this time, big guy.
Go ahead, open it.
Come on.
You stole from me.
You murdered my son.
That's right.
My whole fucking life
l spent building
this place up with your older brother,
from the ground up.
And how does he repay me?
He turns it all over to you.
You were never part of this family.
Just some fuckin' douchebag
wannabe off the streets.
We gave you everything!
And l watched you bring it all down.
That's a fraction
of the money I've seen
you pocket from this place.
What? You think I was
gonna turn a blind eye,
watch you fuck it all up?
You're a dead man, Tony.
No matter what
happens here tonight,
l guaran-fucking-tee you
you will be hunted
Iike a fucking dog
to the ends of the earth!
lt's my time now!
lt's my time!
It's gonna break
Carlos's fucking heart
when he finds out
you killed his brother.
You're so fuckin' stupid.
Your bitch of a wife
already killed Carlos
right before she took
two in her chest.
What?
- What the fuck you talking about?
- You don't beIieve me?
- No, l don't.
- Call her, see if she picks up.
See if she's still
fucking the old man.
Just like every Wednesday, right?
Go ahead, call her.
- No.
- l don't fuckin' believe you.
Here you go. Here you go,
Tony, it's aII yours.
- Everybody's out of the way.
- Fuck you.
What the fuck is this?
Oh man,
you're just in time.
25 grand, Detective--
it's your cut.
This wasn't our deal.
l should have fucking known
it was you who sold me out.
You shut the fuck up!
Your first mistake was coming after me.
- We were partners!
- l got a family to protect!
Something you don't know
anything about.
Do it.
No way.
Do it.
Here's your chance.
He shot Vincent.
Self-defense, right?
So shoot. Now fucking do it.
Come on.
- Jim.
- Get on your knees, Ray.
l need units
to lonia and Franklin.
Homicide suspect
in alley east of lonia
headed northbound.
Request immediate assistance.
Move! Move!
Come on, Jimmy,
think about this.
- Come on, you can't do this.
- Get on your knees, Ray!
You do this,
you're gonna be his lap dog
for the rest of your Iife.
- Shut the fuck up.
- Then what?
Come on, Jimmy.
Are you gonna kill her, huh?
You're gonna have to.
Right? No witnesses.
Come on, Jimmy,
think about this, man.
You can't do this,
not for that scumbag.
Come on, we're friends.
Think about this.
You can't do this.
Think about this, Jimmy.
- Come on!
- Okay.
Move it!
Go!
Shit! Get down on the floor!
What the fuck are you doing?
- Whoo!
- Get it! Get it!
- Whoo-hoo!
- Look at this!
- Where is he?
- He went through the door.
Come on, you son of a bitch.
You couldn't let it go,
could you, Ray?
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.
l'll fucking take--
  Grease me up
with a bucket of sweat
  l'm not leaving till
they're heading out, done yet?
Drop the gun!
Zello, you drop your weapon.
Shane fuckin' did this!
- No, Tony set up the robbery.
- Shut your fuckin' mouth!
- Hey!
- He killed Walter Randall,
he took out the shooters
and he just shot and killed
Detective Jimmy Lagrange.
I don't care
who fuckin' did what.
l'm a witness.
l saw him do it.
AII right, I want
to see your hands up
and get down
on the ground.
Take it fuckin' easy.
You fuck.
Ray!
You fuckin' whore.
You fuckin' set me up.
No!
Oh my God! Ray.
Shane!
You know the drill--
stay on your knees,
hands behind your head.
Nice and slow.
Officer.
Officer, cuff him.
Run him out. Call it in.
Suspect's been apprehended.
Ray.
- No, lady. No no.
- He's innocent.
- He's innocent.
- No, ma'am, you can't.
We're gonna need
to tape off the scene.
- Ma'am.
- Don't touch me!
He didn't do anything!
Ray, you have to
tell them what happened!
- Ray!
- lt's okay, Jenny.
He's innocent.
lt's all right.
- Listen to him. lt was Tony.
- Ma'am, you can't see him.
Get away from me!
Ray!
- Ma'am, you can't see him.
- Get away from me!
- You can't go down there.
- Stop!
Everything's gonna be
fine now. Trust me.
Listen to him!
He didn't do it!
- You can't go--
- Just go with them.
Get off-- get off me!
Ray.
l'm so sorry for everything.
l love you.
Have a great life, Jenny.
Okay, let's get out of here.
  Standing out in the rain
  l never thought

  Shine some light on me
  What the angels see,
