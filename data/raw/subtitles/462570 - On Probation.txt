Everything okay, guys?
You can't complain.
Delivered right on time.
Hello.
- How was the van?
- Great.
We were going 80 mph
and it didn't move.
And that baby must
weigh at least half a ton.
- Do you have a handcart?
- And the shaft?
Will you replace
the empty one for one loaded?
- And nobody is going to notice?
- Let's hope not.
Villegas!
- Come in!
- Look. Get over here.
Come with me.
- Hello.
Have you eaten?
Yes, thank you.
We stopped on the road.
With the van loaded?
Easy. We kept an eye
on it from the window.
- Everything perfect then?
- Perfect.
Not even our wives know.
We told them
we were going fishing in Chascomús.
So nobody in the city
or at the factory knows anything.
That's right.
We had the time
to do everything perfect.
Gauto was transfered from Villa María.
He kept a copy of the set of keys.
And in the city offices we changed
the papers and altered the files.
Clean and quiet.
Good.
- You will get paid next week. Okay?
- Perfect.
And you? Are you sure
you didn't tell anybody?
I mean, you're so quiet. No.
And you didn't talk about
the money you will get either?
You didn't talk to a friend,
somebody at work, a girlfriend?
- Nobody.
- Great then.
- May I?
- Yes, go ahead.
Calm down.
Calm down.
- Does anybody else know about this?
- Nobody, Levonian. I swear.
Tell me. Listen to me. Why don't you
tell me that somebody else knows?
- Because I didn't talk to anybody.
- I know you didn't talk to anybody.
I'm asking you
why you are not lying to me?
See your partner?
He told me he didn't talk
to anybody. And we killed him.
I didn't talk to anybody.
I swear on my children.
You're not listening to me.
If you tell me you didn't talk
to anybody we kill you. That's it.
No loose ends.
But if you tell me that you did
talk to somebody, we can't kill you.
Do you understand?
Yes.
I did talk to somebody.
Yes, but now I don't believe you.
Use chlorine.
The bastard keeps eating.
Watch it!
RICARDO ALONSO
POLICE CHIEF
Yes.
- Good morning, chief.
- For now.
- What a game last night!
- Don't lick my boots. Any news?
Not much. Three stolen cars: Two on
Peru Street and one on Giuffra Alley.
Don't even tell me that.
They broke into a woman's apartment,
took everything and drove her to an ATM.
- Was she hurt?
- Not much. She was beaten in the head.
- Give it to Gómez.
- Fine.
At the disco, Piedras and San Juan, two
bouncers kicked the hell out of a kid.
He was taken to the hospital,
internal bleeding. He died last night.
Oh, God. The press will be
all over us. What a nightmare!
The owner cooperates with us every
month. He's already called to see you.
Have Mancuso follow the case
but tell him to see me first.
Fine. Lastly, the wife of a military
employee reported him missing.
Her husband went fishing in Chascomús
with a co-worker and hasn't returned.
- That was on Saturday.
- That belongs to Chascomús.
No, because nobody
saw them there, sir.
The judge told her to go
to her nearest precinct.
Have Pontremoli look into it.
There he is. Pontremoli!
- Sir.
- Farina has a missing person's report.
Two military employees
disappeared over the week-end.
Excuse me, chief.
Nothing for Díaz?
Why?
- Don't you know?
- Don't I know what?
Díaz is really down. He didn't come
to work Thursday and Friday.
He found his wife with another guy.
She's been cheating on him for 6 months.
So we thought you could
assign him a case to keep him busy.
Yes, of course.
But, is he okay to work?
He's taking sleeping pills.
But we can do what we did
when Gómez lost his son.
Have a shrink accompany him.
I'll talk to the judge to see if he has
somebody available. It's okay with me.
Didn't the judge say lectures in schools
or work with people with special needs?
The police are dangerous.
They kidnap people.
Yes, of course.
You are the greatest.
I was saying that "probation"
means the trial is suspended.
And instead of serving time
I can do community service
in any public agency...
Anything related to my activity.
The civil case continues
but the criminal case is closed.
But why with the police?
What do they want you to do?
I don't know. They want me
to see a detective. I'll find out now.
- You mom called yesterday.
- What does she want?
She wants to know if we are
going today for Passover.
Is it Passover already?
Time really flies!
Do you want me to order something
from "Ciervo de Oro"? We'll stay home.
- Okay. Let's do that.
- Tell me if you don't want to.
- I do, honey.
- No, you don't.
- Hear yourself.
- I'm telling you to do it, honey.
- But you don't meant it.
- Honey, I very much want you...
to order the food
and that we enjoy each other.
Don't get upset.
Everything will be fine.
Doctor, apparently you were charged
with...
...running over a woman.
She threw herself under the car but
her family convinced her to sue me.
She was not injured but they took
my car, my driving license. Outrageous!
In any case, the judge tells me
we can use your services.
Yes, that is correct.
But what do you need exactly?
One of my agents is going
through a very difficult moment.
He found out that his wife
was leading a double life.
- She was with somebody else.
- No...
...she dressed up in disguise
and went out at night to fight crime.
I'm sorry. Yes, she was seeing
somebody else, a guy from work.
Oh, Lord! Sorry,
but I thought it was funny.
The thing is that he followed her
and found them in bed.
- It was something very...
- Yes, a traumatic situation.
Exactly. So the idea is that you
start treating the detective...
helping him to resume his tasks.
His father was a good friend of mine
so this is almost personal to me.
- Does he know I was coming?
- Yes. I mentioned it.
There he is.
Díaz! You old sea dog!
- How are you doing, chief?
- Great, now that I see you.
- Farina.
- How are you doing, Díaz?
I don't know.
- This is doctor...
- Silverstein. How do you do?
- How are you doing?
- Fine.
- Okay, Silverman...
- Silverstein.
The Jewish shrink.
He will accompany you during work.
Farina will give you a report.
Wait a minute. Am I going
with him in the police car?
- Isn't that dangerous?
- Not really. It's routine work.
Besides, Díaz is one of
our best men. You will run no risk.
I'd rather he'd come to my office...
...as many time as he needs
but for a regular therapy.
I don't want to press you but
the judge said I could use your time
...and I do need him on the street.
- Perhaps this is crazy, chief.
Calm down, Díaz,
we'll find a solution.
Hear me out.
Look at me.
There is no tragedy
because there is a way out.
When we understand that,
the present becomes less tragic.
Do you follow me?
Okay. I can see
that the two of you hit it off.
This is completely unusual so let's
figure out a work routine together.
Okay.
- Where are we going?
- Sorry. To a military building.
The missing people worked
for the Purchasing Department.
Purchases for the military plants
at Río Tercero, Azul, Villa María...
Perfect. So now we'll interrogate
their co-workers. I mean "you" will.
- You can also ask questions.
- Okay. If I see that I can help out.
- Tell me about your problem.
- Yes, of course.
My wife, to whom I've been married
for nearly 4 years... she's...
- She's going out with somebody else.
- And what is the problem?
- Well...
- I mean, there is a problem...
She lies, conceals information...
But those are all her problems.
- Have you ever cheated on her?
- Yes, a couple of times.
- Did you tell her?
- No.
- Why not?
- Because it's not that easy.
Of course. But I want to know
how do you feel about all this.
How do I feel?
- I feel anguish.
- Did you at least insult her enough?
- No.
- You didn't? How about that!
- And why not?
- Because it's useless.
Is it useless or you have a certain fear?
Fear of what?
The worst has already happened.
But when the worst happens
we don't need sleeping pills.
It's done. The worst has happened
and there is nothing else to be done.
Her cheating upsets you.
I can see that. But you are in panic.
And you know what panic is?
Panic is the feeling that what
you fear most will finally happen.
- And what do I fear most?
- We'll find that out together.
Could they have gone
with other women? Lovers, friends?
Villegas is very calm.
I don't know Gauto that much.
He was just tranferred from Villa María.
Do you talk to the plant often?
- Yes, work stuff.
- Of course.
Look, anything you hear can be useful:
Deals, missing arms, explosives...
- Do you have a piece of paper?
- Yes, of course.
Thank you.
- Cross my number out.
- What?
Nothing. That's my number.
Excuse me, officers,
the general we'll see you now.
- Thank you...
- Sambi.
Did they have
an official vehicle?
Gauto told his wife
they were taking Villegas' car
and Villegas told his wife
that they were taking Gauto's.
But both vehicles
are parked in the garage.
No, they did not have an official vehicle.
What does Military Productions
manufacture besides arms?
We supply almost
all government agencies.
We manufacture everything from
valves to compressors, demolition materials
for coal mines,
even flares for national parks.
Including supplies
for nuclear power plants...
nitric and sulphuric acids,
ammonia...
- What's the matter? Are you okay?
- Excuse me.
- Any connection with arms trafficking?
- Excuse me?
I read that many Argentine military
are connected to arms trafficking.
- Not all of them, of course.
- Of course.
On the other hand, it's
only the opinion of a journalist.
- No connection that I know of.
- No connection.
Any strange call?
Any strange behavior?
- No, no strange calls.
- No strange calls.
On top of everything
that Nazi looked at me funny.
You put me
in a very uncomfortable position.
Sorry about that
but you were right.
I had not insulted her enough.
I feel much better now.
And why do you think
you didn't insult her enough?
Why did we say that the worst
had not happened yet?
Because she cheated on me
but did not leave me.
And if I insult her
she might leave me.
And your panic would be directly
related to the fear of abandonment...
We never see reality as it is.
We see it through a lens.
For some reason, through your lens,
female abandonment equals death.
- It could be.
- And why could that be?
What childhood experience
do you relate this to?
With the fact that my mom left
my dad when he lost his job?
That's it. That's a key element.
We've gone forward 10 spaces.
- What did your old man do?
- He was a cop.
Why was he kicked off the force?
I was a kid but he was accused of
reselling a shipment of home appliances
which they had confiscated.
- Your father was accused of corruption.
- Yes, he was framed.
The entire precinct was involved
and they needed a scapegoat
and my father was there.
- How old were you?
- About 12 or 13.
That's quite an issue. That's the time
of puberty, pubic hair starts growing
your hormones
are bursting out...
and right when you start
becoming a man...
your father
falls down as a man.
And under whose disqualifying eyes?
- My mom's?
- Awoman's eyes.
You're not just suffering
from your current problem.
You're also suffering from
unresolved issues from your childhood.
And the panic appears when
the ghosts your lens recreates...
...are experienced as if they were real.
"No other woman will love me".
That's in your lens.
But today it is real.
"I'm not worth as a man".
And you can add
the typical ghosts.
"She left me because the other
guy is better than me in bed".
"She left me because
it takes him longer to come".
"She left me because
his is bigger than mine".
Come back here!
- You bumped into somebody.
- It sounded bad but it's nothing.
You son of a bitch!
You crashed into somebody's car hard.
Take it easy. Everything
is fine. Nothing happened.
If you say so.
You're the authority.
- Thank you very much.
- No, thank you.
I think I'll sleep better tonight.
Here is my card just the same.
That's my office number...
My office is right here.
I'll be up until late.
- I'll try not to bother you.
- No problem.
I have a couple of patients
tomorrow morning...
but you can come around noon
for a more traditional session.
- Okay.
- Is that your old man?
He used to make me so embarrassed!
After he lost his job
he was always untidy.
He didn't take care
of himself and drank a lot.
Once I took my girlfriend home
and he ate with no manners.
He drove me crazy.
You drove me crazy.
I did talk to him.
I tried to make him change.
Now I feel I could
have enjoyed him better.
Let's leave it here and we'll
go over this in detail tomorrow.
- That's a key issue.
- Okay. Thanks.
- Where do you live?
- I'm staying at a hotel in San Telmo.
I don't want to go home for now.
- Especially after what I did today.
- Of course.
Do you have plans for dinner?
- Hello. Hello.
- Hello.
Diana, my wife.
This is detective Díaz.
- What's your first name?
- Cameron.
- You're kidding me.
- Yes.
- It's a bad joke of mine. It's Alfredo.
- How are you doing?
- This is nice.
- Make yourself at home.
Thanks.
That's my office, the studio.
Large spaces... with few walls...
Sorry I invited him, honey.
Tomorrow we'll do something alone.
Are you kidding me?
We had planned... Why do you do this?
Please, Diana. And try
not to be too warm with me.
He's having marital problems
and he is very sensitive. I love you.
- Is jazz okay for you?
- Jazz is perfect.
- And this?
- Córdoba.
I took it during our last
trip together three years ago.
It looks dangerous
but he is three feet from the ground.
He pretends to be brave
but he is my cotton bunny.
Shall we eat?
- Like this, right?
- Careful, that's very bitter.
- Very bitter.
- It's called chrain.
- We eat it to remember we were slaves.
- During the Second World War?
That too but I was talking
about Egypt 5700 years ago.
- Don't bore him with history.
- Bore him? History is fascinating.
- Soup?
- Yes.
Interesting mix.
Now you have a Jewish friend
and I'm friends with a cop.
- There is a lot of prejudice about cops.
- I wouldn't call it prejudice.
- There a lot of corruption.
- Is it necessary, Diana?
It must be hard to be part of
an institution people question so much.
There's all kind of things.
But when salaries are so low...
Teachers and doctors are also
underpaid but they are not corrupt.
But they have no guns. If I were
in charge I'd raise the salaries.
You don't want somebody
unsatisfied carrying a gun, do you?
That's true.
- These balls are good.
- Thanks. I ordered them.
What did you do today?
Nothing. I went
to the dentist in the afternoon.
- Everything fine?
- Sort of. I need a root canal.
What else?
I read the classifieds.
The company she worked for
closed. She is an accountant.
- Anything wrong, Díaz?
- No.
Tati called. She can't
come cleaning on Thursday.
Are you sure you're okay?
You look upset.
I'm fine but I think
your wife is cheating on you.
- What?
- She's cheating on you, man.
What do you mean?
What are you saying?
- Are you cheating on him, yes or no?
- What?
Easy, Díaz.
You're projecting.
- What is this guy doing?
- Are you cheating on him, yes or no?
Easy. Did you go crazy?
Answer my question.
Put it down now.
Calm down, Díaz.
You're not talking to her.
You're talking to your wife.
- Are you cheating on him, yes or no?
- Put the gun down, Díaz.
- Tell me, yes or no.
- Yes.
Put it d... What?
What?
- Are you cheating on me?
- Yes.
- You're cheating on me.
- It's true. It's true.
But I love you.
You're an asshole, Diana.
- I felt so lonely, not cared for.
- Speak clearly, you, idiot.
I thought you were seeing somebody
else. You paid no attention to me.
And then we read Madame Bovary
in my literary workshop...
And the teacher said
she was a brave woman.
Madame Bovary was a brave woman
because she lived in another century
when women were repressed
and didn't cheat on their husbands.
Nowadays, all women do it
so you're just another idiot.
Please.
Lord!
You're out of your mind.
How can you do something like that?
- My God.
- Who is the guy?
He taught the literary
workshop she took.
How did you know?
It took her too long
to answer a simple question.
And she didn't have her wedding ring on.
Women usually take it off for that.
We're not married, Díaz.
I don't have a ring either.
- How long has she been seeing him?
- I don't know. A couple of months.
Four months.
Get me out of here, please.
Unbelievable!
How can this be!
What a bitch!
What a fucking bitch!
And I'm such an idiot.
- Why?
- I really neglected our relationship.
I was very much into work.
I went to about 20 congresses alone.
- Of course, she is right.
- She is right?
- She cheated on you.
- So?
I've also had my stories. It isn't
terrible, it doesn't mean anything.
- Why would I become chauvinist now?
- But she'd think it's terrible.
That's the point. If I take
some distance then there is no tragedy.
- Still she acted wrongly.
- Wrongly?
She was screwing another guy.
- She's 38. A handshake doesn't do it.
- She lied to you.
- She couldn't tell me the truth.
- For months.
- Two months.
Sounds like a long time but it's not
much in terms of cheating time.
She saw him once. Two weeks
went by and then again.
That's about a month.
Multiplied by two, it's two months.
That's your head
not your heart talking.
But what matters is what
we think. I don't even know what I feel.
There you go.
Cry like a man.
- Do you copy?
- I copy you, central.
A van turned up in the river
with 2 bodies. It could be your guys.
I'm on my way.
Please, step aside.
Clear the area.
- Good evening, sir.
- Get me another one of these.
Here, put this on.
- Here you are.
- Thanks.
- Coffee, chief.
- Thanks.
- Come with me.
- Shit, it's pouring.
- Chief. Farina.
- Díaz.
It's your guys. Tell their wives
that they've come back from fishing.
- Doc.
- How are you doing, chief?
They knew what they were doing.
They dumped them in the deepest end.
They would've never come up
if it hadn't been for the storm.
- Everything okay?
- I'm not sure at all.
I don't know.
I'm really not sure.
- Any ideas?
- Arms trafficking perhaps.
Or they were intercepted with a shipment
on their way to the triple border.
How is it going with the doc, Díaz?
Fine. He is really helping me.
He is helping me a lot.
I'm sorry.
- Are you up to continuing with the case?
- Absolutely.
What other information
do we have on the vehicle?
The plate is missing but we have
the engine number. We're running it.
It's probably stolen.
That lock is not the original one.
Talk to the Coroner. I want
the report for tomorrow morning.
Any lead is very important
to me. Thanks, Farina.
Now I'll get you a nice room.
You'll take a hot bath and go to bed.
- Thanks so much for everything.
- Please...
Take one of these. At least
you'll sleep for a couple of hours.
- Thanks.
- Try to relax.
The coroner's report will be ready
in half an hour. Do you want to come?
Is it a good plan?
Gunshot entrance wound in this region
and the exit wound here in the neck.
The bullet also grazed
the interior right leg.
This determines that the deceased
was sitting at the time of death.
There are traces of a non-ferric
material in the victim's palms...
...steel, lead or aluminum.
Findings are consistant with handling
of heavy objects for a long period.
Villegas was shot
against a wall or against the floor.
The bullet enters
through the right jaw...
and ends on the second back tooth.
Some resistance
blocked the bullet's exit.
The outer casing was damaged.
Ballisticswill have the report ready by 10 AM.
You are new, right?
No, he's a friend. He's depressed
so I took him out for a walk.
Hi.
For what it's worth. You have
less problems than they do. Next.
Good morning. I'm here for
the report on Gauto and Villegas.
They brought it half an hour ago.
This is no photo outlet.
Wait over there, please.
SILENCE PLEASE
RESPECT SHOOTERS
I should see a couple of patients today.
But I don't feel like seeing anybody.
But I should call them, right?
To at least let them know.
No, I won't call them. Screw them.
They are always upset. Today I'm upset.
- Do you want to give it a try?
- Me? You're crazy.
Put that on.
I feel like I'm
in Lethal Weapon, Díaz.
- Oh, God.
- Thunder, .9 mm.
15 rounds. Semiautomatic.
Precision: 35 meters.
You put the clip in,
you feed ammo into the chamber...
Arms relaxed, I face the target
and lean forward a bit.
- I aim at the enemy.
- I have no enemies, Díaz.
I shoot.
- Your turn.
- Yes.
The other button.
There. That's okay.
Let's see. I put the clip in.
- I feed...
- You feed ammo...
Arms relaxed.
- Shall I?
- Go ahead.
- Not bad.
- Three shots in.
Near the silhouette.
Not bad for a beginner.
Your pulse pulls to the left.
Can you see that?
- Yes, I see it.
- We'll work on that.
- Yours pulls upwards, right?
- What does?
Your pulse. Where did the shots
that did not hit the target go?
They were all in
but they hit on the same spot.
- Weren't you here for a report?
- Sorry. Let's go.
Come on.
- So?
- .38, of course.
- Why of course?
- Because it's a revolver.
With a pistol, the casings jump out
and they can be left behind as evidence.
With a revolver casings stay in
and you take the evidence with you.
- It's much easier to trace.
- But that's a good tip.
Sort of. There must be
750.000 people with.38s.
Brazilian made revolvers
cost about $150 at a gun shop.
- Do you copy me, Díaz?
- I copy you.
You were right. The van was stolen
from Constitution two weeks ago.
- From what side of Garay Avenue?
- 1900 Santiago del Estero St.
Near the train station.
Was it stolen at gunpoint
or was it picked up from the street?
It was parked.
- Day or night?
- 3 PM.
- Thanks, Farina.
- You're welcome.
HERE WE LEARN
TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY
- Where are you going?
- To Constitución area to visit a friend.
- You're doing better, right?
- I guess. We'll see how things go.
Exactly, man.
We'll see how things go.
- Do you smoke?
- No, thank you. I don't.
- What are you doing?
- I'm smoking.
- But that's pot.
- So what?
- You're a cop.
- So?
- Pot is illegal.
- You've never smoked pot.
It doesn't matter. I'm with a cop
and we should set the example.
And you are, don't worry.
Besides, what do you know
if I've ever smoked or not?
Because if you had you wouldn't
be so prejudiced about it.
Give me that. I'm ruined any way.
This is crazy. In broad daylight.
Hold the smoke.
You're incredible. You cross with a red
light, you smoke pot. Unbelievable.
- For how long?
- For as long as you can.
Look... I take two glasses
of wine and I'm drunk.
Look at that sign:
PILLS TO FIGHT HAIR LOSS
Advertising can be so deceiving.
If your wife is deceitful, why do you
expect advertising to be any different?
You're right about that.
Hi.
- I can't believe it.
- What?
- What's the matter?
- No, nothing. I can't believe it.
- Come on, what?
- Nothing, Díaz, nothing. Please.
I've just figured out the thing
about the egg and the chicken.
How didn't I see it before?
- So which one was first?
- The egg.
- And where does the egg come from?
- I don't know but it's an egg.
From anywhere, from under
a rock, the sea, from another egg...
You can have an egg appearing just
like that but not a fully grown chicken.
Who can even think about something
like that happening? Do you get it?
- It's possible.
- Possible? It's obvious, Díaz.
- Think about it. Don't you get it?
- No, I don't. So what?
You've been nagging me
for two hours. "Don't you get it"?
- I was not born in a golden cradle.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.
- Don't be mean to me.
- I'm not mean. Come on. Cheer up, man.
- Why are you singing "Happy Birthday"?
- You act like a sad kid, I cheer you up.
Besides, it's Plin-Plin Clown's song.
- No, this is not possible.
- What?
It's terrible. Let's see.
Sing Happy Birthday, Díaz.
- Happy birth...
- Plin-Plin Clown...
...dear...
...and he...
What a scam!
It's exactly the same melody.
I didn't even get a buzz.
- I'm hungry, Díaz.
- We'll have lunch after this visit.
- Who is your friend?
- Acar thief.
How can you know that somebody
is a car thief and not arrest him?
If he were in jail, he wouldn't
give us the tip he's about to give us.
Besides, he's my friend.
- What is this?
- Trust me.
Keep working on that. Come on.
You have to hit it properly.
Like this. Look.
Go on, Sepúlveda.
- Yes?
- I'm here to see Cardinalli.
Cardinalli is not in.
- Freeze!
- It's okay. He's a friend of mine.
He's my friend.
Sit down. Come here.
I can't believe it.
This idiot moved my balls.
Sorry, pal.
They were right here.
- Anything to drink?
- Sparkling water, please.
- One sparkling water.
- I'll have an a Fanta orange soda.
- Who's the dude?
- My shrink.
Your what?
What are you up to?
I'll take one, okay.
A Kangoo van was lifeted from 1900
Santiago del Estero St. Two weeks ago.
I've been dealing only
with imported wheels for two years.
- Do you want to visit the slammer?
- Again?
I only do imported wheels. The national
ones only go for $ 1000 in the market.
They make 1000% over that.
That's the gig. And I run the risk.
And I have to pay off the cops.
No, they are crooks.
Who could have done it?
It was broad daylight.
The Chileans.
The fucking Chileans.
We chase them away but they
come back. They are worst than lice.
Puma! Find out who did a Kangoo
from 1900 Santiago del Estero Street!
- Who do I ask?
- What do I know, Puma!
You've been in business since you were
15 and you don't know who to ask?
- Put your fingers up up your ass.
- Sorry, I didn't mean it.
- You didn't. Order your own, dude.
- Okay, don't get upset.
- You're right. I'm with Díaz.
- What do I fucking care who you're with?
Ok, but we're all friends.
Keep it cool, man.
It's Puma. Cardinalli wants to know
who lifted a gray Kangoo van...
from 1900 Santiago del Estero Street.
Hold it.
When was that?
- How do you know it was gray?
- Because he said so.
- Wasn't it gray?
- It was but I didn't say it.
No, he didn't.
I don't know how but I know.
Can't I not know how I know something?
- Are you doing a job on me?
- No, of course not.
I've been feeding you for 3 years
and you're working on the side?
You feed me? You get $1000 and
give me $ 50. You're such a cheap shit!
- I run with the risk.
- Are you calling me a cheap shit?
Who are you calling cheap shit! Let go!
I didn't mean to lie to him
but this is a contact from before.
It was a fast gig.
Just a van. They paid cash.
- Where do I locate him?
- Look, his name is Oscar...
We only speak
over the phone. He always calls me.
I have no idea what he does.
I ask no questions, just in case.
Where did you
deliver the vehicle to?
I changed the lock and he asked me
to leave it in a garage, 900 Alem Ave.
- In front of a military building.
- I don't know. 900 Alem Av.
- And he didn't pay you?
- He did, when he ordered the job.
- I didn't go to see him after that.
- Where to?
Nowhere. I said
that I didn't see him.
No, you said that you didn't go to see
him after that. That means you saw him.
- I want to know where.
- I don't follow you.
I don't know you but you seem
rather limited. Show me some respect.
Tell me where you went to see
the man who ordered the job.
He hangs around a coffee shop.
- So you saw him several times.
- What do you mean serveral times?
Stop it! It's only 4 P.M.
He asked me to go see him at a coffee
store several times. He must like it.
- Where?
- At the corner of Belgrano and Balcarce.
That was easy.
Listen. I don't think
he comes here every day.
I'd rather we went go to the
precinct. Let's do an identikit.
- I don't know who he is.
- Walk, Puma. Come on.
"Walk, Puma". In some countries they put
you in a witness protection program...
- they give you a home, clothes...
- In a while I'll take a cab home.
No, he's not here.
- Can we talk to you?
- Yes, of course. What's the problem?
- May I...
- Go ahead.
I'm a police officer and we're
after the lead of a stolen van.
The vehicle turned up in the river
with two bodies in the trunk.
And the trail I'm
talking about led us to you.
- That's so strange. Why?
- That's what I'd like to know.
- I have no idea.
- We'll find out together.
- What do you do?
- Right now I'm reading the paper.
- And in general?
- I'm unemployed.
- Your name?
- Carlos.
- Can I see your ID, please.
- I don't have any.
- No ID whatsoever?
- No. Nothing.
- You'll have to come with me then.
- Are we under state of siege?
No, but I consider that you
don't want to cooperate with me.
No, I do.
I am cooperating.
In any case,
shouldn't you identify yourselves?
- And you are?
- We ask the questions.
What's your relationship
with the guy over there?
- None.
- That's strange!
He's a car thief and he has just pointed
you as the person who bought the van.
What is this?
What are we doing?
What's Camarasa? Lisandro Prada.
Weren't you unemployed?
I asked you a question,
Oscar, Carlos, or Lisandro.
Do you have anything to say?
I asked you a question.
Go back to work and let me
have my coffee in peace.
- Excuse me?
- I'm not repeating it, Alfredo Díaz.
Stop asking questions or your wife
and children will show up in the river.
I have no children and as for
my wife, take down the address.
You're a cop.
What are you up to?
Arms, drugs?
What's Camarasa?
- Easy, Fatso. Get lost.
- What?
Get lost.
I'm doing you a favor.
- Who are you?
- You're about to chew a bullet, asshole.
Believe me, I won't have
to give any explanation about it.
- Let's calm down, please.
- Who are you?
- Bag it or we'll bag you.
- Let's go, please.
You're under arrest for
threatening a police officer...
Get up slowly
and come with me.
Easy. Let's see what we have.
A.38 special. Guess what did they
killed those guys in the van with?
Knock it off.
Officerl!
Hand-cuff that man!
Officer!
I'm Díaz from precinct 59.
Do as I say! I'm with
the Intelligence Services, SIDE.
Send a back-up unit!
Listen to me.
Get over here!
They are coming
with me for questioning.
This person never said that he
worked for the intelligence services.
He even refused
to identify himself.
He behaved like a mafiosi. Knowing Díaz
was a cop he threatened him.
"No more questions or your wife will
end up in the river". Things like that.
Arias' people are working undercover
on a case I can't discuss with you.
But the case is related
to the death of these two persons.
And Díaz is part
of the band we're investigating.
The Federal Police is completely corrupt.
The government is pressing to...
to straighten things out
before the elections.
He's not the only one
with dirty hands at 59th Precinct.
I'm not talking about
minor corruption cases.
There's armoured cars,
security payments, extortion...
bribery, prostitution...
illegal car stripping...
In fact, Díaz' informant
is part of a powerful gang.
But don't worry. We'll question him
and then we'll let him go.
It's much better to see where he
leads us than having him locked up.
Please pass over to us
all the cases Díaz was working on.
Coroner's reports, Ballistics...
Yes, of course. You'll have them
on your desk tomorrow morning.
- Could it be tonight?
- Sure, no problem.
And as regards the doctor,
we'll waive his probation time.
- I can talk to the judge.
- No, I'll take care of it.
Okay. Tomorrow we'll ask you
to come to give your statement
about what you saw
and heard during these days.
- Is that okay?
- Fine.
Yes, it's Levonian. Can you walk
out these two people in here?
Thank you.
Sirs. It's been a pleasure, chief. No,
please.
- At your orders, doctor.
- Thanks.
The chief won't be a problem.
Keep an eye on the shrink.
Tap his phones.
See what he does.
He doesn't have a clue.
I don't think he'll be a problem.
But if he does anything suspicious,
make sure he has an accident.
Okay.
I need the last three-month
period reports, Jose.
Don't worry. I have
people working on it.
RESTRICTED AREA
...enriched uranium is stored in pools
under strict security measures.
The facilities are guarded
by Gendarme officers.
Our operation is supervised by
the Intl. Commission of Atomic Energy.
- This is a real killer.
- Follow me to the reactor, please.
I remind you that taking pictures
is strictly forbidden inside the plant.
We shouldn't laugh so much.
Come with me.
Good afternoon, Díaz.
I'm Jose Levonian.
You are in the Restricted Area of the
Special Affairs Unit under my orders.
Therefore, we'll enjoy
having a certain privacy.
I don't want to waste your time
and I don't want to waste mine.
I'm a very busy man.
I have many things to do.
We've been working on
an operation to be carried out tonight.
I want to know if the you have done
or said something that could ruin it.
I know nothing about
no operation. I have no idea.
I only stole a van.
Let me go. I swear I'll say nothing.
Shut this clown up.
No, leave him alone.
Let go of him.
Now, should
I be concerned or not?
- You scared me, Diana.
- Where were you?
- I left you eighty messages.
- Oh, yes. I was mad.
Camarasa...
What is this?
Camasara Transportation Inc.
What the heck is Camarasa?
Were you with somebody else?
- Were you with another woman?
- No, I wasn't with anybody else.
The company picks up
and transports HazMats.
Then why do you
have a hickey on your neck?
It's not a hickey, it's a bruise.
A police officer shook me down.
They provide transportation services
of highly dangerous toxic subtances.
- Where did you spend the night?
- At a hotel. What the heck is this?
- Do you still love me?
- Yes, Diana, of course I love you.
Camarasa won the bid to collect
HazMats from the Campana Atomic Center.
- Yes, but you're still mad.
- Yes, I'm still a bit mad.
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
- Do not ignore me!
- Calm down. I'm not ignoring you.
Yes, you are. You've always
ignored me! Look at me.
- What are you thinking?
- I don't want to think anymore.
- Okay. What do you feel then?
- Nothing serious.
Perhaps we're not meant for each other.
About being each other's
other half... We're so different.
Perhaps you're half a pineapple
and I'm half a kiwi. Who knows?
It must be that Sambi guy.
He's been calling all day.
- Who?
- Sambi!
- Hello.
- It's Sambi.
- Who?
- From Purchasing.
- You gave me your card.
- Oh, yes.
I can't reach your partner.
I talked to a friend in Villa María.
Somebody took an R-22 tank.
They are made to order
for the Campana Atomic Center.
- An R-22 tank?
- They are made of lead.
- They are used to transport uranium.
- Uranium?
Do you know how much terrorists
would pay for it on the black market?
With 500 grams
you can make an atomic bomb.
- An atomic bomb?
- Don't mention my name.
I hope you find the motherfuckers
who killed our pals.
Hello. Hello.
- Who is that guy, Diana?
- What guy?
- That one
- I don't know.
Stay here.
- Yes?
- How are you doing, doctor?
- I'm agent Lomianto with the SIDE?
- How do you do?
- Could I talk to you?
- Yes, tell me.
- Can I come in?
- Not right now. I was about to eat.
I thought I would give
my statement at SIDE offices.
- Anything wrong?
- I've just been assigned to the case.
First impressions are very important.
It won't take long.
Yes but no. You can call me
tomorrow and we'll work it out.
- Would that be okay?
- Yes, yes. Perfect.
Good evening then.
Damn it!
Diana, calm down.
Calm down and get me
something to tie him up.
- Who are you?
- Aim at him, please.
- What do you mean who am I?
- Tell me the truth.
Since when have
you been lying to me?
- What?
- Since when are you a spy?
Was it all a cover?
Tell me the truth, please!
I do tell you the truth.
You're the liar, Diana.
Is this why you paid no attention
to me? Nothing was real then?
- Tell me who am I living with, please.
- Everything is for real.
Stop crying, please.
And hand me the gun.
Do you copy, Lomianto?
SIDE, INTELLIGENCE SERVICES
- Do you copy.
If I don't answer
they'll call in somebody else.
Repeat what I say, word for word or they
will take you out of here in a body bag.
Please calm down, Diana!
- Yes, I copy.
- Yes, I copy.
Any problem?
- Negative.
- Negative.
What's the doc doing?
- He's having dinner with his wife.
- He's having dinner with his wife.
- Any news there?
- Who is this?
- Get me out of this.
- It's me, Lomianto.
The crook is history.
- And the cop?
- And the cop?
He won't make it
through the night.
- Roger.
- Roger.
Negative. Roger. We're not
at war. Keep me posted.
Come on.
Jump down, please
Jump. Good.
Diana, open the trunk.
Open the trunk.
Everything is okay. Relax.
Do as I say.
Good evening.
He's getting married.
- Everything is okay.
- I don't know how to do it.
Step to my left.
Get in the trunk. Please.
Come on. Get in the trunk.
Do as I tell you.
Calm down, Diana.
Relax.
Listen to me. Call a car
service and go to your parent's.
Do not use any phone
and don't try to reach me.
- Is it clear?
- Yes.
I've got to go.
I've got to go, honey.
- Hon, you're under stress.
- Yes.
- Do you know what to do?
- Go to my parent's.
Good. Good. I've got
to go, honey. I've got to go.
I want no reaction. Is it clear?
Díaz is under interrogation.
Nobody interferes
and nobody asks questions.
Intelligence is handling the case.
They have us by the balls.
If we don't do as they say
there'll be some heads rolling.
- What are you doing here?
- I tried to stop him, chief.
Leave and close
the door behind you.
Hear me out. They'll kill Díaz.
We must get over there right now...
Díaz is in good hands.
I suggest you calm down.
He is in my trunk. He broke
into my house and tried to kill me.
Puma was killed. Now they want to do
Díaz. I heard it over the two-way radio.
Intelligence services
are handling the case.
And your relationship
with the precinct is over.
What do you mean? This is a group
of crooks in a clandestine operation.
They'll steal uranium
from the nuclear facility at Campana.
Villegas and Gauto delivered
the R22 to transport the uranium...
It is manufactured
by the military...
They were killed because
they knew what would happen.
You keep talking
and I'll have you arrested.
Are you nuts? Are you listening
to me? I'm saying they will kill Díaz.
Arrest this man, Gómez.
Didn't you say it was personal and that
Díaz' father was a friend of yours?
I'm saying that a friend of yours
will be killed and you do nothing?
I said: Arrest this man.
I'll fire whomever interferes.
Is that clear?
I've been in this for years
and I've never had any problem.
I have an operation tonight.
Could I run into a problem?
Don't be stubborn, Díaz.
Quit suffering.
Answer me and I'll shoot you.
Are you waiting for prince charming?
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Lord!
Error, error, error.
- Good evening.
- How are you doing?
I'm López, 27th Precinct. Somebody
foundthis ID and brought it to the precinct.
I suppose this person works here.
I don't know. Many people work here.
Give it to me. I'll hand it in.
Unfortunately, I can't do that.
I have to deliver it personally.
I even need somebody to sign for it.
Who knows what happened to him.
You should find out, right?
- Wait a second.
- No problem.
It's been 40 years.
I've had my happy moments.
- Come in.
- Thank you.
- Good evening.
- Let me see.
Yes, he works here.
We'll hand it over tomorrow.
- Where do I sign?
- What?
The guard told me
you need me to sign.
Yes, please.
- Do you have a receipt?
- Just write it down on a piece of paper.
Write "I received the ID card of
agent so and so from officer López..."
Lord. My god.
- How's the game going?
- It's a rerun from last year.
I think I saw this soccer match.
- Argentina is playing who?
- That's Racing Club playing.
- Yes but they are playing who?
- "The Bugs".
- Great game.
- What else can I do for you, officer?
- Could I use the bathroom?
- No.
No? That's so mean. I come
here to do you guys a favor...
I need to use the bathroom and
you give me that ironic smile of yours.
- I can't let you in.
- You can't let me in?
- I'm with the Federal Police.
- This is SIDE. You have no access.
- I'm talking as a human being.
- I have to ask you to leave, officer.
- You won't let me in.
- No, I won't.
- You won't.
- Let him use the bathroom.
I can't, Juan.
He's not authorized personnel...
Authorized personnel my ass.
Let him use the bathroom.
- Under your responsibility.
- Yes, it's my responsibility.
This way.
Leave your weapon.
- Your weapon, the pistol.
- Yes.
- There, on the counter.
- Yes.
You work nights risking
your life for the minimum wage...
and this rookie
treats you like that.
Whatever happens
this was a very nice gesture.
Nothing will happen, champ.
Believe me, the last thing
I want is to cause you trouble.
- Relax. You'll cause me no trouble.
- Okay, okay.
The bathroom is nice but there's
no toilet paper. Could I have some?
I'll bring you some.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Haven't you noticed anything strange?
- No. What happened?
- That's what I'm asking you.
- I don't know.
- You don't know
- I don't. What happened?
- Is the prisoner still inside.
- Inside where?
- Where can he be? Where?
- I don't know. In the restricted area?
- Of course.
- I didn't know there were prisioners.
- I have no access there.
- How could you?
In a serious country
you shouldn't even know where it is.
- But there's a sign outside.
- On the third floor?
No, I'm talking about the eighth floor.
We're talking about different things.
Go on with your duties, please.
He doesn't know anything.
Let's go on.
I'll take care of this.
- Do you copy, Radames?
- I do.
See me at the meeting point.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
RESTRICTED AREA
"It's better to ask for probation
so you don't have a criminal case..."
This is very obscure.
Of course it won't open!
Stop!
Animals.
- Seal.
- Seal. Five points. Now, colors.
- Fucsia.
- We have an intruder.
- What do you mean?
- Are you blind? The cop in the bathroom.
Move, please.
God.
My god.
This is unbelievable.
Yes.
Morales, front desk, we have
an intruder. He's in a police uniform.
- Is everything okay in your area?
- Everything fine. Keep me informed.
I'm speechless.
In 35 years I've never
seen anything like this.
- Let's give me the club, please.
- Yes, of course.
- May I step in?
- Please do.
I want no trouble.
I just want you to let Díaz go.
- Lomianto, do you copy?
Yes, I have him.
He's in a safe place.
Let Díaz go and I'll
tell you where I have Lomianto.
Very good.
You want to negotiate.
- Where is Lomianto?
- I'd rather you let Díaz go first...
I don't trust you guys.
You shouldn't.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Sectors G2, G6, and G8.
Toxic waste. External containers.
Very well.
- He knows nothing. He's harmless.
- Harmless?! Hands behind your back!
He violated our security and entered
the Restricted Area through the window.
Listen. It's important.
If you kill us, you have two problems.
One, I'm the only one who knows where
your agent is. Two, I know many people.
This won't be easy to cover up.
I've removed presidents.
You don't know how easy it'll be.
We need to get out of here.
Uranium is dangerous in the wrong hands.
There's nothing to do.
They are going to kill us.
We must think before
saying something like that.
I've been thinking for five hours.
Where's the air conditioning vent?
- There's no vent.
- Let's get rid of the handcuffs
and let's try to fight them.
- We can't get rid of them.
- We can't get rid of them?
- That's what they're made for.
- They'll kill us.
- It's me. I mess everything up.
- Don't say that, Díaz.
- I ruin everything.
- Trust me. I charge $120 the hour.
Get me out of here. I'll put
you in contact with a colleague.
You still have
many things to go over.
- What about you?
- I'm your friend.
- Do me! Don't touch him!
- No, please!
- Yes?
- It's me, Morales. I have the cake.
- What?
- It's my birthday... a piece of cake.
Cake.
What piece of cake?
- Good evening.
- Get in there.
Shall we go, guys!
- What a mess!
- Hold it, Díaz. He let me in.
You could retire tomorrow.
Your kids will never need to work.
My son is 19. He's never worked
and causes me enough trouble.
They are coming for you.
It's your word against mine.
Even if you get out of here alive
you'll never make it to Campana on time.
Díaz!
- No.
- Let's go.
STAIRS
Let's go. Come on.
- There. Stay put.
- Do you know how to fly this?
I took a seminar at the academy:
"Flying Helicopters 101".
The tail is operated by the pedals.
The main blade, with this.
Look at this. Do you know
how much these are worth?
- How do we start the engine?
- It's a Volkov, so it should be here.
Remember turbines
must never go over 600 degrees.
Was it 600 or 800?
- You didn't take the seminar?
- No, I took "Computers 101"
It was on Logo. "CS, turtle home",
"Right 90, turtle turn" and all that.
Will you know how to land?
Wouldn't it be better to surrender?
Relax.
You load, release the safety catch
and shoot. 24 rounds per second.
The good thing is that if you miss
you can correct your aim as you shoot.
I have another one.
How many more people at the plant?
- Be still.
- Be still, he says.
I'm following orders.
If you move, I'll shoot.
I want you to know that I know
dangerous people throughout the country.
Let me go or one day
you'll be just run over by a car.
- Or you'll fall under a train.
- Why do you treat me like that?
I pay my taxes. My money pays for
your salary and that's how you treat me?
You always have such a sour
look on your face. Cool down, man.
You can't leave the tank in there.
It's dangerous.
You read about corruption
in the papers every day...
And you say: No, these guys
can't be all that bad.
But they are! Why can't you just go
to your office and do things right?
No, you need to speculate,
you need to threaten people...
I won't repeat it again. Let me go
or you'll never sleep in peace.
You shut up or I'll shoot you
and bury you in an open field.
I also have friends in the force.
And we can cover that easily.
Shoot!
Shoot!
NO FISHING
Chief Alonso, Precinct 59.
Let's see, guys.
Thanks.
What's going on here?
I have not received a full report
about what happened yet...
But I want you to know that
my staff ignored direct orders of mine.
You have all my support to take
whatever measures you want.
Come on. Get in here.
These men prevented
a dangerous international operation.
I've always encouraged
my men to follow their instincts.
A policeman must do what he must.
- Coffee, boss.
- I'm good. Thanks.
- Are you Díaz?
- Yes.
- Can I have a minute with you?
- Of course.
- So? Everything okay?
- Everything fine.
Strange but fine.
Come over here.
- Why strange, what happened?
- That guy was with SIDE for 10 years.
Now he's organizing an agency
for international security.
He worked for the government
or for the UN, I'm not too sure...
He wanted a detailed
report of what had happened...
He couldn't believe it.
He wanted to know if...
we would be interested
in joining him in.
- Joining him in?
- He's putting a team together.
Independent cells with 2 or 3
people from different backgrounds.
He mentioned a 6-8 month training.
- But it would be as an agent?
- Yes.
Perhaps this is a step
forward for you but I have a life...
it's a bit disorganized but...
this has nothing to do with me.
You might be right. Perhaps
this has nothing to do with you.
- What training? Shooting?
- And languages, parachuting, diving...
Besides, intelligence services go after
awful things. Don't be naive.
Yes, but they will continue to exist.
It'll be good to have two people
like us in the organization.
I could never skip rocks.
Can you believe it?
You're not holding it right.
Curl your index around the edge.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
The guy asked me if you could be
a spy with the CIAor Mossad...
Somebody who enters a building
like that and shoots the way you did...
It didn't enter his mind.
And after the training
we would get a mission?
- Yes, it could be.
- Everything okay, Díaz?
You are not, are you?
- Am I what?
- A spy.
