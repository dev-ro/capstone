THE EXECUTIONER
Specially subtitled for my friend Raymond
by Miguel Ángel Díaz González
Hello, good morning.
Here we are!
Come in.
Well, now you tell me where
we can leave this...
Put it over there and wait
until I let you know...
Ah, and mind not
to scratch the wall!
Here you are...
One cigarette? Eh...?
What a horrible morning!
What bad luck I have!
Well...? They yet...? Eh...?
Those are the ones
who were present...
The last one is the counsel
for the defense... - Come on!
Come on!!
Look!
That's the executioner!
- Come on!
Come on! Come on!!
Where...?
- Here.
Here...?
-Yes.
Here you are, take
charge of the keys.
Hey, you could've leaved this
somewhere else, couldn't you?
I'm sorry.
Enjoy your meal.
Do you smoke?
- No.
I should give up for the bronchitis,
but I have no courage.
Ah, the envelope, thank you very much!
I put it away because, in the streetcar...
Open!
Could you do me a favor?
What time does the first streetcar pass?
Still one hour left.
Couldn't one of these gentlemen take me?
- Don't ask me!! Ask them! - OK...
Have you seen
the executioner?
Yes. - They were paying. Tell me, how
much do you think he will earn for this?
Don't ask me. To tell the truth,
he looks like a normal person.
If I'd meet him at the cafe or the cinema
I wouldn't say he's a executioner.
Could you believe that I like him...? - Really?
Ask this one if he likes him. - Oh, c'mon...
Goodbye, gentlemen.
May God be with you.
Hey, why don't we
ask him to get in?
And so he will tell us everything!
No, no. I won't ask him anything. I hate that.
I will! I feel so sorry for him! - I'm going away, eh?
- No, c'mon, wait a minute! - I'm going away!
Excuse me! Excuse me! Would you like us
to take you if you're not going too far?
Well, you will do me a great favor, because
the streetcar won't arrive until one hour.
If I don't cause any trouble...
- In no way! Wait, I'll get in first...
C'mon, get in!
- Thank you very much.
"...has no life..."
"The one who's jealous
has no life..."
Times have changed!
I'm sure about it!
Before, one worked
with more solid people!
This one I was talking you about, in his
last moment, calmly... - Hey, you see?
It's just that my colleague here, didn't want
us to take you... - Always the same! - No, no, no...!
It's just that like this,
without knowing you...
It's always the same story!
We're misunderstood people!
That guy, giving me his watch,
told me... told me: "master..." - But...
But yet sitting on the chair, and with the iron gadgets in the...?
- Yes, wait. "Master", he told me, "take this keepsake..."
"...and please forgive me I had to
disturb you so early..." Here! Stop!
The Race leeds
to the worst!
Mind the door
while getting off...
Well! Thank you very much!
Shall we go for a coffee?
With great pleasure!
No need to ask! - But, c'mon...!
No, c'mon, no! The family's coming behind us! That's
not possible! - Ah you're right! - You're welc... - Bye!
Hey! But, what happens? - Very thankful!
- See you next day! Bye! - Why don't you go on?
Wait a moment, wait a moment, don't be
in a rush, c'mon! We'll go on inmediately...
Let's see if that's true, this is a rudeness!
- Yes, you'll see...
He left his case! Hey!
Run and see if you
can reach him. - No!
No, no, not me! - C'mon, you're young!
You're his friend, take it yourself...!
Me...? How do you want me to go down
those stairs with this asthma I've got?
Give it to me, you always
get your own way! - C'mon!
Mari! Mari!
What's up, Pilar? - Tell me, did you
listen to the novel yesterday?
Oh, yes...!
What's the matter?
Good morning, madam,
I just wanted to leave...
Door "C"!
This is for
Mr. Amadeo...
We're  keeping nothing!
This is a respectable house!
Watch out, madam!
I have nothing to do with this, OK?
OK!! OK!!
"...and he had a guide who was afraid to be seen..."
It's always my turn to do this kind of things...!
"...if you knew what
a terrible fright I got...!"
"Just realize..."
What do you want?
I'm sorry if
I disturbed you...
...but the porter told me letter "C"
and it seems like she made a mistake...
Well, it's this one...
I just wanted to
see Mr. Amadeo...
He's inside.
I'm bringing
the case.
Father, they're
bringing your case!
Hey! Come in! - No, no, thanks,
I'll leave it here for you. -Come in!
Of course! Come in!
This poor head I've got...
I was yet about to
phone the undertaker's.
I tried to reach you at
the underground, but you...
Well, would you like
a cup of coffee?
A cup of brandy? - No, no, don't take the trouble!
- No, but I've got the coffee done yet.
Sit down, sit down!
- Thank you.
This is the gentleman who took me home,
look... She's so clean: My daughter.
Nice to meet you.
- So do I.
But, please, sit down.
- Thank you.
You've got a quite reliable job.
- Yes, but...
I'd better go to Germany to...
to learn mechanics.
Why? Your job is so secure.
There's never crisis.
Yes, of course. Last winter
we've had a lot of work.
But I'd prefer something
more up-to date.
Tell me, do
you like it?
Just a bit bitter. - Put some sugar,
it's very good. It's from the jail.
Thanks...
You're very kind...
Tell me... Does
this shock you?
Yes, a bit.
Also you believe that our job...
- No, I believe in nothing.
Not everybody thinks like you.
Wait a minute, wait a minute...
María! - "Yes?"
Your kid is getting wet at the patio!
- "Oh, what a boy!" - Take him, c'mon!
For he's crying!
"Thanks, Carmen!"
- You're welcome.
"Look! Look at yourself! I'll show you...!
You'll get what was coming to you...!"
It's... it's a nice day, don't you
think so...? - Yes, thanks...
No, no...!
Thanks to you!
Is... is that one your fiancé...?
- No, that one's the watch's...
Look! Look!
Please read! Read!
No, no... those ones
are just relatives...
Ah, "Public garrotting"...
- No, no... just the dedication...
Of course...
- The whole dedication...
To the mas... ter Amadeo, in grat...
i... tude for his col... laboration...
...Cor... - Corcuera!
- Corcuera.
A great writer! A bachelor! (- Yes)
A great man! He had to turn to me! (- I see)
A great pleasure! Once in a
while they're fair with us!
Well, I'm... I'm going off,
the van's awaiting...
Oh, that's right! Poor thing!
How did you find him?
Quite... normal,
calm... sober.
They make me laugh when they say
that public garrotting is inhuman!
Is the guillotine
better, then?
Do you think it's fair
to bury a man in pieces?
No, I don't know
about those things!
Because you're
a good person.
It's necessary to respect the executed,
who's enough unfortunate yet!
And what can you tell me about the
americans? Give me! Give me your hand!
Yes... - Just put your fingers
inside here... - No!!
Ah, you're scared! And that's only 120 volts...
- But, father, will you be quiet? I'm ironing!
Well, the electric chair
has thousands of volts...!
It leaves them carbonized, scorched...! Tell me if
there's any humanity with that famous chair!
I believe that people should die in
their own beds, don't you think so?
Of course! But once there's a penalty,
somebody has to apply it!
"...I'm going to the bakery...!
- Bring me five loaves, they are yet paid...!"
Would you like
some more coffee...?
No, thank you.
"Drop that! You'll cut yourself!
What on earth can your mother be doing...?"
Can't anybody
come take the kid?
I have to take charge
of her everyday!
That's quite enough!
Why did I have to leave a boarding
house where I was so comfortable...
For I'm
paying here!
And I'm within my rights
to sleep alone, I think.
And once and for all, you'll give up making
me every night responsible for her!
I'm old enough yet!
And I don't feel like
acting as a baby sitter!
Hurry up, please! You're inside there
since one hour ago and I must leave!
I yet told you to go to the patio,
I can't go out now!
But I yet had a wash in the patio! I can't do
everything outside, don't you think so?
OK, but I can't
go out now...
Damn it!
I begged you to make me an omelette
and you left it burned to a crisp!
Here everybody
eats at two!
If you're going off with your
friends then do it yourself! - Yes...!
Yes, of course, of course...!
Do it yourself, do it yourself...!
That's so easy for you... But I'm
paying, you know? I'm paying!
A three-year-old
baby, an angel...
The one time I
ask you a favor...
One time? But every
night's the same!
And what for, anyway? Just to bring
another one to put in my bed, isn't it?
But this baby can't understand!
- Go on with you!
Otherwise organize
yourself better...
Here there's 50
pesetas missing...
I took them to pay the phone bill, you know?
- Oh, very nice! 50 pesetas for just 2 phone calls!
Here you are... - You don't
say anything, do you?
C'mon, c'mon. Come and let me
fit you with this... Come, come...
You're warned, Antonio...!
...One of these days I'm taking half
of my furniture and going away!
Just ignore him, for
you're the older brother!
The older brother...
the older brother...
In this house, when it's about
paying, I am the older brother!
Paying... paying... As if we'd give
nothing in exchange to sir...!
If this doesn't suit him, he can go away, for he's
not necessary here anymore! - Sure, to go away...
Is the armhole comfortable...?
- No, it's alright, it's alright.
Check, check...
- OK...
Here, it's a bit
tight here...
You don't say
anything, do you?
Of course! It's so handy for you
to have a brother as a dummy!
If my poor mother
could see me...
She'd be scared to die again, with that face you have...
- No!! For I'm no poor devil! - Be quiet! - No...!
And some day you'll realize
that I can do something important...
You despicable! Stupid!
You do the same thing every day!
Here we all wash ourselves and we
don't need any water, you despicable!
The windows, baby, the windows...!
- They can't be closed...!
We're such a crowd and
we must air the house!
Hey, I wash myself although the toilet's
always full! - It's not about washing!
There are certain jobs which
leave an unbearable smell...!
Good morning.
- Good morning.
Does José Luis
live here? - Yes.
I'm Amadeo. He surely talked to you about me.
- What do you want? - I came to pick him up.
Antonio, they're coming
to pick up your brother!
Hey, c'mon!
- Amadeo!
You became a priest?
- No, this is just to help my brother.
Is Carmen here...?
- Yes...
Carmen! - Ah, yes.
I'll finish in a minute.
Tell me, what's the name
of that cute thang?
Mari Pili. - Oh, it's a girl.
- Sure. - Here you are!
Here's a nice candy! - Here you are...
You also work as a... - No, not me, not me...
Your brother has talked
to me a lot about you.
I already know that you're a tailor.
- Qualified Military Ecclesiastical Cutter.
Antonio... - Yes?
- Could you lend me the camera? - OK.
No, the kids' photographs
are inside! I yet told him!
I can see you're very fond of
birdies. - Just to sell them...
He can't sell
a single one!
I yet told him to cultivate mushrooms, but he
never obeys me... - A better bussiness!
Are you passing by Rosales? - No.
- Yes... yes, yes. - Just a minute...
But, hey, are you maybe going off
without making your bed...?
I'll make it this evening,
when I come back.
Good bye!
Here you are. Deliver this to Liutenant-Colonel
Ramírez, he's waiting for it. - Oh, yes.
In Ferraz, you know...
- Yes, yes. - And have... fun.
The Boring One's got a
girlfriend. - Some tramp!
Your brother has no sense of shame!
I can't believe he brought that van here!
But what will the
neighbours think...!
Provided that he marries and
goes away once and for all...!
It's normal! I yet told you
that the baby's normal!
That my father's not hereditary,
damn it! How should I tell you?
And this one, still
without my beer!
He's serving at that table... - Excuse me, please bring
me my beer! - I'm on my way, wait a moment!
...And a glass
of water!
Hey, look how great!
The ice didn't melt yet!
Try it and see if you like it. If you tell me
you don't, you'll get me really upset!
Did you make
it yourself?
Yes. - It's delicious, Carmen, delicious.
- Father, not too much for you, OK? - Now it's alright.
This girl's a real treasure,
boy! Believe me!
Hey you kids!
- Be quiet!
I'll stand up and they'll see... - They're knocking
everything down! - Let them enjoy, c'mon!
Well, in truth, now with the van, I don't know
why we're not coming every Sunday...
Sure... - ...For this is wonderful!
- Yes, but what about the duties...?
Everybody who dies on
Sunday should go to jail!
Would you like some more sugar? - No, no, it's
great. They should serve it this way at home...
But that thug that's
my sister-in-law...
Carmen... should I go to your house as a
lodger? - Me...? Whatever my father says...
Look! What you should
do is to marry...!
...to form a home as
everybody does...
...and there's no doubt that
you'd live very much better!
That's just what I was telling this one
the other day. Isn't it true, Ignacia...?
Hey, Ignacia!
I'm just saying that José Luis should
marry... - I just dozed off...
Me, after having lunch... - If I... But then
you start thinking about the wage, the flat...
What the young people wants
is freedom, dear Álvarez!
Sure, sure!
Yes, freedom... Freedom for bearing my sister-in-law,
that old bag who... - Be careful! Beware sisters-in-law!
Three years ago one ended up
poisoning his! - And you... bang!
Sure!
- Tell me, tell me...
Maybe, your wife... - Not at all! Don't worry
about my wife. She's sleeping like a log!
You were talking about
that brother-in-law...
Things were going badly... I'll show you...
- Father, we have just eaten...!
I was going to apply the iron gadgets but
he had his neck like a bull, this thick.
So then the iron gadgets didn't fit him...
- Oh, sure, they didn't fit...
The iron gadgets are
applied... Raise your head...
The iron gadgets are here...
And then the other one...
Ouch, you fool!
Look at this tree! It seems to be
made of cork, doesn't it?
I wonder if it
has pine cones...
Hey, look what a wonderful thing!
Doesn't it look like the sea?
All right! And I have
to learn to swim!
Would you like to dance?
- OK.
What I should do
is to go to France...
And why not to Germany?
That way we could go together...
It's all the same to me. The fact is that
I want to leave... I'm so unhappy...
Why?
But, Carmen, you don't
look bad at all...
If I... if I can do something
for you, just tell me.
But... can't you understand? When the boys find out
that I'm the executioner's daughter... - What?
They always break up with me...
- That's what worries you...?
The same thing happens to me! They all go away when I tell
them that I'm an undertaker! We have the same disease...!
If they want to dance they should bring
the music! - They've got a cheek!
"...the fabulous special offer of Essex... Buy right
now your family pack for only 9 pesetas...!"
"...or medium size
for only 5 pesetas."
"It's the White Wolf, ooh..."
"...white, wonderful!" - Carmen, do you like it?
" - And how clean are..."
"...the clothes when washed with Essex!"
- A beautiful landscape...
"Veteran! Veteran!..."
- Where would you like to die?
To die...?
Yes.
Me...?
"...it's priceless..."
I don't know...
If you
don't mind...
Please...
- Ah, sorry!
Hey! Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Come! He's already here...
- Just a minute! - Leave it!
Does the plane appear OK?
- Of course it does...
C'mon! Come! - Here you are. - Thanks.
- We're at the customs. - Very well.
Give us a hand...
Let's see... With care... - Slowly... - Take care...
Down with it... - That's it... - Doing well...
Bring it down now! Good!
- That's it! - OK!
Come on with
that guitar!
This must be
for the bombs...
No, c'mon! This is a
passenger transport!
Oh yes, yes... But everything's prepared
for war, you gullible! We're on our way!
As soon as there's a conflict... bang! They take
that off and the atomic ones start falling...
Good heavens!
Well, then I'll phone her, and in
case she's alone, I'll go there.
And you're leaving me
alone with all this mess?
C'mon! C'mon, man! Sometimes I did the
same for you, didn't I? - No way...!
You always say the same, and I always
end up taking charge of the dead!
No, I said! But, aren't you really
going to do me this favor? - I said no!
If it just
consists of...
As soon as you tell her that
I had to leave my job... - What?
Resignation, baby... resignation!
- I can't!! - Resignation!!
Slower! Or we'll miss the family!
We'll miss the family, don't go so fast!
OK, take it away.
I'm sorry, but
we have to open.
But all the documents are in order!
( - Sign here.) It's the rules.
The key, please. - What? - We have to open, it's the
rules. (- And, here, in consignee...) - The rules...
Meanwhile I'm phoning the cemetery to
inform them that we're on the way. - OK.
Baby, the key... - The key, please...
- Yes, I've got it... - Very well.
Is it necessary to open it completely?
- No, no, it's not. - Thank you.
It's not him. - What?
It's not him! - How couldn't it be?
He looks so different, poor him!
Give me the photo!
Here's the photo! But how couldn't it be him? - I think
it's not him! - C'mon, pay attention, look... you see...?
He hasn't got a moustache, look at him!
- She got married by proxy, you know?
Poor little thing!
He's so slim!
(Well, I'm closing) - It's just that his beard grew,
try to understand, c'mon! - How slim, poor him!
Poor him, poor him, poor him...!
- Calm down, baby, calm down!
Sorry, madam, thank you very much. I'm always
disturbing you, but this is an urgent family matter...
Hi, Carmen! How's things...? Yes...
Is your father there...?
Yes? And when is he going off...? No! No, no...
I don't want to talk with your father, no...
As soon as I finish I'm going there...
(- The photos...)
How much is it?
- 20 pesetas.
I've got a surprise for you...
It's something you will like a lot... Yes...
It's a photograph
of Charlton Heston.
Charlton Heston!
C'mon! That one who plays
Ben-Hur...! Here you are...
Yes...
No! No, no... It's just that he was here at the airport
this morning. I met him... - Ah, but he's here...?? - No...!!
Yes... yes... a photograph, with an autograph,
yes... for you... - Hey, c'mon, we're waiting...!
Carmen, I'm in a hurry,
we're going off, bye!
Hey, they made his face up like a woman...
To whom? - To the American...
Not even his widow knows him...
- Really? - You'll see...
I'm telling you it's not him...
- All right. - Thank you.
No... - If they lay them out there, don't you realize...?
- I'm telling you it's not him! - Calm down, calm down...!
And who's this
puny one...?
A cyclist.
He won a lot of
races, you know?
Oh, really? - But then he
went away, as all of them did...
I look much better,
don't you think so?
So so... Shall I make
some coffee for you?
As you wish.
I'll be back
in a minute.
You want it
black or white?
No, no, black,
as always.
Carmen!
- What?
Shall I tear it up?
- Tear what?
The cyclist! - Yes, darling. And the bicycle, and
whatever you want! I don't care anymore!
Carmen!
Listen! We already
have a flat!
I'm already
in the list!
Carmen?
Carmen!
Yes...
Carmen, we already have a flat!
I'm already in the list! We have been awarded!
A lovely flat! We must go
to see it inmediately...!
Look! Look! Three rooms,
central heating...!
But, what's the
matter with you?
You're not glad?
- Yes, yes, quite a lot, of course.
There will be new
people! Young!
Father - What?
- It's just that I love José Luis.
Ah, very well! A very good boy,
quite reliable... Very well!
He's here, he wants
to speak to you...
Here...?
Where...?
Over there...
I've got a
terrible headache.
You've got
a headache...
And barefoot...!
You rotter!
You crook!
Wait a moment... When you find somebody like this
you think of the worst, but... - Get dressed!
OK.
And even when I came
so happy, you wretch...!
You wretch! And in
my own house!
...And naked! - Father, don't start exaggerating!
And, besides, I'm not naked!
What will the neighbours think...!
- I don't care what the neighbours think!
They have been
critizing us for all life!
Furthermore, father, if I don't
watch out, I'll die single!
Father...
José Luis is
not a ruffian...
And even when
I came so happy...
The happiest
day in my life!
And you ruined it!
Especially you!
It's incredible!
I... I assure you I did
nothing, Mr. Amadeo...
Here you are...
Have this coffee...
This has only
one solution!
What a pity...!
With those views...
You could see the mountains...
He got angry! Why did you tell him I was here?
- And what could I do? It's much better this way...
If he finds you without knowing
anything I think he kills you!
Carmen...
Should I go off...?
- No, no, no no...
Wait... wait...
You have to speak to him
and tell him something.
Me? And what
should I tell him?
I don't know... well... tell him
that we're going to get married! OK?
Ah... married...!
- Just to calm him down, damn it!
Even though
it's a lie...
Mr. Amadeo...
I'm a good man...
My intentions are good...
And I'm prepared to give you a pleasure
that's even better than the flat's.
Mr. Amadeo, I'm asking for your
daugh... daughter's hand, Carmen.
Stop playing and start working!
This is no cabaret!
Here you are, you absent-minded... You wrote
"her inconsolable children" and this woman was single...
Rich?
Very, just look...
In that case I'll write
"From José Luis, her adopted son"
Have you talked
with the boss...?
Yes. There's nothing to do. - C'mon...!
- We're only five people going...
The one time we earn expenses...
He has a grudge against me!
What's the matter...?
Face it once and
for all, come on!
No. No, no... See if you can take her...
Where? To the burial...?
You've got a
real problem...
"The day after tomorrow I'm having a wedding...
- You genious...!" - "C'mon, that's it...!"
"...And what about the coffin, did you
note it down...?" - "If you don't get down..."
Come on, give me the niece's
one... - Here you are.
And candelabras...!
- Yes.
Hey, Fernando! Take these candelabras,
I'll fix the dynamo...
Are you looking
for someone?
Yes, José Luis Rodríguez.
José Luis! They're
looking for you!
Couldn't you wait at home...? I'm working!
This must depart inmediately...!
Here you are.
And well...
Yes or no?
Yes.
"Positive reaction"
So that means
it's certain...?
Well, maybe they are mistaken, for last year they told me
I had typhus and finally it turned out to be chickenpox...
Don't worry, we'll do whatever you want...
- Yes, of course, of course... whatever I want...
But if it's just that I should
go to Germany...!
...for in one year's time I could become a skilled
mechanic... and leave this job, once and for all...!
But now... just tell
me how could I!
If you think that I am to blame...
- To blame... to blame...
So then what would
you like us to do...?
I could go alone,
couldn't I...?
And, as soon as I
find a job, I'll call you.
And the baby...?
The baby...
An exectioner's
grandchild...
And what has my father to do
with all this and with the baby...?
No, just nothing. It's just that if the baby
comes with the grandfather's instinct...
...it would be better
not to be born.
Don't say that!
Congratulations!
Congratulations!
I congratulate you!
There you are.
- Thank you very much.
You!
Come on,
pick this up...
Come on! You!
Come!
Hey! Aurelio!
Stop playing!
Yes, enough.
Come...
C'mon, mind that
garland! Jump!
Now... standing up,
standing up... Stand up!
In the name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
Notice, my siblings, that you are
celebrating the marriage sacrament...
...which is necessary for conception
of the Human Gender.
And to all of you...
...if there's no object...
...it's granted to them...
...it was instituted by
God in Heaven on Earth...
...and consecrated with the
Royal Presence of Christ, our Lord.
It's one of the Seven Sacraments of the Church...
(- Move that way! That way! That way!)
...with the big importance and with the
virtue and dignity of what's small.
Thank goodness to the ones who
take Him with pure minds, with which...
I told you several times that the organ must be
tuned. Now three notes at two registers fail...
Request's yet done,
request's yet done...
You! Stop eating
the cut-outs!
Hey, Sigüenza!
Yes? - See if you can reach the one who
forgot this. He's from the previous wedding.
Not that way! This way!
This kid gets me so angry...
Stop making noise with your throat,
c'mon! We're at the church!
Give me what's mine,
I have an opening tonight!
Wait a moment, wait a moment...
- You release the Austro-Hungarian romance's?
Don't forget my
two tickets, OK...?
Well, this is what we got...
Here you are. Here you are.
And I'm supposed to have
my throat hurt for this...?
Hey! What else did you want? Learn, fuck it...!
(- Father, you were right. That mountain prize...)
Will you come, please?
Yes. (- ...was won by
Vicente Trueba...)
(...I congratulate you!)
- Well... (- I told you so!)
I'm sorry but I must go off. We have two clients before
the afternoon. - You can't come to have lunch?
C'mon, Ignacia and
the kids are staying...
OK, as you
wish. Bye.
So, you'll give the dress
back yourself, OK?
Ask by Jiménez, the manager, and make him set
for you Álvarez's price, for they are chums, OK?
At least, in your daughter's wedding you could
have worn some other suit, don't you think so...?
But if it's new...
Anyway, I used it three times
in five years... - Yes, of course...
Are you feeling alright...? - This hurts me...
- The godparents! - Me! - Yes... the godparents...
Shall I sign as
Ignacia or as Igni?
As you usually sign...
Excuse me, do they sell
ice creams near here?
I don't know, madam, I don't know.
- Oh, I want one!
C'mon! later, later...! - Let's see...
The witnesses! - Yes, the witnesses...
Antonio!
Antonio!
Antonio!
Hurry up!
What a shame! ... I told you so!
- ...wait, you have to sign!!
Come, let's go. - You have to sign!! - Start the
engine, start the engine! Start it and pull!
Let's go! Release me!
- Wait a moment! - Let me go!
You can't...
You can't offend us this way! - Ha! You won't expect
me to sit down at the table with that monster!
Come on,
go ahead!
Listen, José Luis, we have
yet come to the church...
Try to understand it...
For us, that guy is not... NOT!
For we are decent people!
Let's go, Antonio! - I'm begging you!
They want you to
come have lunch...
Moreover you have to sign... - Ah, no! You won't
sign anything! What's written stays written! No!
No! There's no one else! If you
don't sign my marriage's not valid!
I have to go back...!
- OK, OK, I'll sign and that's all!
I told you and
you didn't obey me!
From now on, you'll go your way and we'll go ours.
- Oh, Antonio, don't sign anything! - Let's go!
I'll sign and then come back. - Can't you see that your children
may be ashamed of you in the future! Antonio, come back!
That depraved is going to ruin your life!
He's going to get you into trouble, Antonio!
Obey me!
Antonio, don't sign!!
Excuse me,
it's this one?
Yes, madam.
Come on, old chap!
We're finished!
A third floor,
almost a fourth...
Why didn't they give
me the first floor?
But this house
has a lift, father...!
And when the lift breaks
down, what will I do?
You should have stayed downstairs,
that way you wouldn't have got tired...
This is so light!
What a view!
Third Right.
It's a fourth!
Kitchen, toilet, living-dining
room with its terrace...
One bedroom, another bedroom
and another bedroom.
This one's mine.
- Well...
Yes.
- ...what do you think?
Great!
I like it!
But there's something in
this flat I can't understand...
Let's see... Where's the kitchen?
- Here it is, this one...
No, handsome, use the door!
Get used to it!
Also, look! It's great! Just two
steps from the dining room!
Now I'll see the
plan and I'll tell you...
And here's the terrace!
In summertime, with a beer...
Amadeo!
Look how wonderful!
- Take care! You'll break your neck!
But, what are
you doing?
Hey, where are we
going to sleep... there?
No! That yet belongs
to the neighbours...
Ah, it's not
yet ours...
Well... If you don't
need me, I'm going off.
Bye.
Thank you
very much!
Bye!
Stay well.
Hey!
Hey! (- What?) - But what are you doing, c'mon! (- I'm just
discharging the bowels!) - And you got just in front of my house!
(- Oh, yes, whatever!) - You'd better stayed in yours! (- Go on...!)
Just let me report it and you'll go to jail
and give up doing that for a long time!
wardrobe...
dresser...
Hold this, please...
But, what are
you doing?
Look, this could
be our bedroom...
The bed is
right here...
No, c'mon! No, here
is the dining room!
Can't you see that it
has the terrace...?
And look, it's great,
how wonderful!
You can even
see Guadalajara...!
And where are
we sleeping?
Oh, just here...
Interior?
Oh, you're right...!
Why don't we exchange
it with your father's?
C'mon, it makes me sad.
That poor little thing is so old...
He doesn't need air, but, however, we do.
Especially for the baby, you understand?
C'mon, will tell him about it? - No, you tell him,
you tell him! He'll hear you more than me.
Amadeo!
Amadeo!
Have you seen this bedroom? More
shelter, for the winter... - Very good!
Don't you think, Carmen, that he'd be better?
And it's much more comfortable...
No, no! I won't move
away from here! No way!
OK, as you wish...
(Excuse me...) - I can go anywhere. It's the same to me...
(- Are you the guard?) - No, madam. - They told us he was here...
Isn't this one Third floor Right?
- Third floor that it's a fourth!
That's ours!
But, how yours?
- No. - It's ours!
It's here! - Look... - The one given to us by the Board.
- Let me see, let me see... - Look, look...
It's ours! - But what
are they saying?
They're saying that this flat is theirs! - Ah, no, no!
- Of course! - There must have been a mistake, no...!
I was just taking
measurements... - No, no...
There can't be two families in the same flat, madam...
- Hey, but what are these fools talking about?
- How?? - Don't be rude, madam!
Don't be rude, there are children here! - Madam, this flat is
ours and very ours! - After being two years waiting...!
Yes, yes...
They both are employees, of course...
And from the
Board, of course...
Dated with a two-month
difference...
Yes... just
a minute...
They're saying that you'll get retirement in three
months, won't you? - By age, just by age...!
For I see myself strong, and so... - Then the flat is this
madams'. The houses will be finished after your retirement.
And my poor daughter is going to live
in the street? - That's it! - Just a minute!
Just a minute!
This gentleman's got a
daughter...! - Of course!
Yes, yes, married.
- Yes.
Since the lady's married, she has no rights
to stay in the flat after your retirement...
But she's single!
- Single...?
That's my misfortune!
Just ask me
about my job!
And see if you can find that
stupid who wants to marry her!
Then, what's that
man doing here?
No, no, no... I don't know anything! I'm the person in charge of the
furniture, and nothing else! - You're nothing but a nerve! - OK...
Obviously, Third floor Right is this gentleman's. I'm sorry.
We'll call you. - Then may them enjoy it! Let's go!
Yes... yes... - Don't look! We, thank
goodness... (- Bye) - ...are decent people!
OK, but you have to prove that your
daughter is single, for the appearances...
I yet told you that this is my misfortune! - No, no, no!
Documentary proofs... Birth record, spinsterhood
certificate... The documents, you understand?
Done!
Sir... you are done.
- Yes, thanks.
In public buildings you always
must enter well-dressed. - Yes.
C'mon! Wait
for us here...
What happens?
What?
What's the matter?
I can't.
I can't!
Then what did
we come for?
I don't know. - Did we agree or not? - Yes, yes, yes, yes, Yes.
Then let's go! For, just for entering, you undertake nothing!
No!
Carmen! But, you
don't say anything?
Yes! What do
you think?
What would you like me
to tell you, my love?
Do whatever
you want.
Don't worry
about me.
I was just thinking
about the baby...
Of course! Of course!
The baby...
Let's go!
That's best.
The only solution.
Bye, darling.
Bye, father. (- Bye, daughter.) - I'm going sale shopping to
buy some little clothes for the baby...! (- Very well!)
Ah, and some
shirts for you...
Hey! What's
your size?
Eh...?
I can't remember!
You don't remember...
Father, what's his neck size...?
A forty-one!
Yes! Forty-one...
OK. Bye.
...Please listen to me...
(- No!) - ...José Luis...!
...Come here...
- But what has he got?
He's mad! - I won't go in!
- But what happens with him?
What has he got? Where is he going? (- How can't
he see me...!) - Couldn't we come tomorrow...?
But how tomorrow! - Other day!
- But, how can it be tomorrow...
But, c'mon...! (- And tomorrow you'll say not!)
- ...We want the flat or not?
Yes, yes!
- We want it!
(Excuse me, give me two ice creams... strawberry.)
We agree... So then, how could I prove that my daughter is single?
But you could say that
you don't want to resign!
I wish I could!
I'm still strong!
But the rules
are the rules!
Sit down, father!
Sit down and give it up!
I'm fed up! I'm nothing but
completely fed up with you both!
This boy's a mental case!
He didn't understand anything!
But don't you understand
that I even can't kill a fly!
I... I couldn't kill it
in my whole life!
I'm surprised at that! When you're
always working with dead people!
Yes! But they all have been (- Bah...!) dead people
I never knew in life! They all died a natural death!
Completely
unknown to me!
Are we going or not?
C'mon, say yes...
Those ones are...
Is it you who wants
to be an executioner?
N... No, no, no, not me. It's this... man...
(- Ah, you...) ...do you understand...
...who insisted... - It's just that we thought
that the only way to not lose the flat...
It's just that this
form is incomplete...
Here is a stamp missing, you understand? - We didn't know
how much it is... One fifty or three? - Three pesetas.
Two ones!
And what
about the sign?
Not until knowing whether it was
right or wrong... - Come on, sign!
Throw that away!
And sign! It's OK!
Here...
With this movement Alekhine
won the championship... - Bah...!
OK, let's not waste time!
He can write or he can't?
He's very intelligent!
He's almost a bachelor, c'mon!
Then come on!
Hurry up!
OK! It's alright...!
And, as soon as you've got it, you're bringing me
the criminal record, and pretty clean, OK?
Look at the
trap... - OK...
Here you are...
Look at it. - How? - Clean!
- You've got it yet? Wow!
Now you only need... Think about it!
Think about it! - Bah!
Well, not a parental permission,
for you're old enough yet...
Yes, but last year I had mumps... you know...? - Don't pay
attention! He's healthy as a horse! - And what about a
certificate of no criminal record? - Here are two ones!
Let me see...! - The parish priest's... - Very well...
now the other one! - ...And the Guardia Civil's...
- Very well! - And now... you need...
...The military record!
And with all the checks done!
His? - Of course, c'mon!
- Yes.
There must
be my file...!
How couldn't
I know!
It's number 37.
How number 37...? Is it that there's more people...?
- Of course, there are 36 gentlemen before him...
Then there's
no hope...?
If you haven't got a good recomendation,
then there's nothing to do...
No! We don't know anybody, no...
- Shhh... don't worry about that...
Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye.
- Thank you very much.
My friend the academic will
fix everything, you'll see...
Yes, Amadeo... - Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.
You see?
Checkmate...
VISITORS OF THE BOOK FAIR...!
...AT THIS MOMENT, DEDICATING
HIS BOOKS AT STAND NUMBER 25...
YOU'LL FIND THE WRITER AND
ACADEMIC MR. CORCUERA...!
Is it here where they're dedicating books?
- Yes, yes, madam! - Is there Mr. Pemán...?
No. Today it's Mr. Corcuera.
- It's the same, isn't it? - Yes...
Mr. Corcuera...
These ladies...
- Of course! With pleasure!
It's for our little niece...
- Addressed to...? - Elenita Santonja.
Will she like it...? - Won't it be
too violent for Elenita...?
Excuse me...
excuse me, sir, please...
Have you got something about
Bergman or Antonioni...?
Bergman... Bergman?
- Yes.
The actress...?
- No, no, it's not the actress...
Thanks...
"For Elenita"...
How nice...! And it seems to
be interesting... - Yes, yes...
But where is he?
- It's that man with a moustache...
No, c'mon, no! He's now signing...
- Don't worry, he'll hear me...
Will you please tell us if that man who's
signing over there is Mr. Corcuera?
No, we don't know.
- Thank you very much.
Let's go, my son...
No! No, no, I won't go. I'll just wait for you.
- Without a recommendation, there's nothing to do!
But can't you understand that it's much better
that you go alone... (- Let's go now, let's go...)
...If I don't know him... Do what I say! C'mon! Go yourself!
Mr. Corcuera...!
Those ladies...! They're going
away without paying...!
Shall we bill it to
your account...?
Well... that's the bad part about signing! People
come along... then they take the books...!
Excuse me, have you got leaflets, please?
- No, no leaflets, kid...!
Greetings!
Good morning!
- How are you?
Very well...!
- You don't remember me...?
Y... Yes!
Of course I do...!
Here you are...
Please read... - A signature...?
- No, please read...
But... this one's
yet signed!
Read... read
and you'll see...
Ah... c'mon !! Of course !
How are you?
You're always in practice, aren't you...?
- What else could I do...?
Are you interested...?
Yes... of course... I... ah, the book...!
- "History of American civilization".
Yes. How much is it?
- 350 pesetas.
How??
- 350.
Ah...! No, no, then I'm not... Please forgive me...
Thank you. (- I see.) - Thank you...
José Luis!
Come here!
No! You! You!
I'll wait...!
It's just that the poor little thing's so shy...
But he'll come. You'll see... - Yes, of course!
But how young you look!
More than me!
That's the best
about Italian art...
And well?
You've seen it yet?
What? - You made up
your mind? - This...?
What is it?
- "History of American civilization".
Ah...! Yes!
Yes, yes...
A... And... how much is it?
- I told you before. 350 pesetas.
(- ATTENTION...! ATTENTION...!)
No... it's so expensive... I'll come back some other day. - OK, thanks.
(DISTINGUISHED ACADEMIC CORCUERA IS SIGNING
COPIES FROM HIS LATEST NOVEL "ABEL NOCTURNO"...)
Come! - No! - José Luis, come here!
(WHICH HAS BEATEN THE EDITORIAL BOOM OF HIS PREVIOUS
FAMOUS BOOK...) - Come here! (- "PUBLIC GARROTING".)
Tell me... Much
work this year?
Not much...
That one who killed his wife, his
children and a security guard...
He was a
naive person...
Ah! This is my
brother-in-law...
That's distinguished Mr. Corcuera...
- Nice to meet you. - How are you, young...
Let's see...
what do you want?
No, it's nothing...
It was just to see if we could do
something for... for the flat...
You see?
He doesn't want to!
No, no, no... I only want... - But, c'mon! Can you tell me
the reasons why you refuse to follow the tradition...?
That's it! - If it's just
a matter of dinasty!
Look... In France, in England, the position always
passed from father to son, and from son to grandson...
That's it! - No, it's just that I'm the
son-in-law, I'm not from the dinasty...
What I wanted
to ask you...
...is if you think it's fair for me to
accept that job, that occupation...
I have no reason to object,
you can do whatever you want, but...
society will always need a
justice executor... - That's it!
...Either you or another...
- You see? Eh?
Yes. But I think that society needs a very...
practical one... self-confident... determined...
But if you advise it, if you think
it's alright, then... I'll do it...
Because, in the last moment,
I can always turn in my resignation...
Ah, no, no, no! If I recommend you,
you can't make a fool of myself!
Don't hear him! (- It's just that
I don't...) - Recommend him!
I'll vouch for him! He's a very
honest person! Believe me!
Anyway, I don't think he's the most suitable person, but...
- That's it! That's it! I'm not most suitable person!
I only want a recommendation
to work in some other job...
In Germany, for example. I'd like to work there...
- Oh... you're all so boring, with Germany...!
Anyway, I'll do whatever
your father-in-law wants...
But now you must forgive me, because I'm
indebted to my friends, my admirers, who are...
The book! The book! - No! He got angry! Let's leave!
- Mr. Corcuera, one book! - Ah, very well...
This one, "Abel nocturno"...?
- Yes, thanks. - No, "Public garroting"!
-Ah...! - But, Amadeo, don't you realize...?
- Come on! "Public garroting"!
- How can it be possible that he doesn't...
We already
have got it!
Let's see...
Your name?
My name is not important. Your sign, your
sign is what we need... Thank you very much.
"To the future
executioner..."
"...the follower of a family tradition."
- Very well!! Thank you very much!
"Corcuera."
Thank you!
Thank you so much!
- Thanks! - I'm thankful.
It's closed.
It's closed!
Don't worry,
c'mon! Don't...!
You can't read?
CLOSED.
I beg your pardon...
Don't you remember me...?
I always see you doing strange things...
...but it's closed. - Yes, I know that time is up, but,
since we were coming directly from the cemetery...
Hello, good morning! Hello, good morning.
Yes, sir, you are right...
It's just that the speeches
made us waste a lot of time...
Don't make me come back, Mr. Arbella. You know
that I always try to be on time. - Thank you!
No, no! Don't worry, it's not from the funeral!
The one who died didn't smoke...
And who died?
And what could we
know about it...?
First class. I won't
say anything else.
So you go to a burial and you
don't even bother to know who died..
Well, for the speeches they told, it seems like he was a
good person... - Oh, yes, very good! Rodríguez, José Luis.
"Special services".
Here you are. But next time, be on
time and come dressed as a person.
Don't worry,
Mr. Arbella...
It's been because of the speeches.
One first, then another...
And they all said
the same...
That he was very good,
that he started from scratch...
...That he was from the National Board...
Those things they say at the burials...
Mr. Arbella... Thank you, thank you very much!
You're welcome. - Goodbye! - Goodbye! - Goodbye!
Utilities... Social Services... Charity Fund...
Look! I even get points for the kid!
What a cushy job you've
found with this! - Yes...!
But... here they don't say anywhere
that you're an executioner!
It's secret! The cashier
doesn't know it either!
And... you wanted
to go to Germany...?
Miss... we're always
at your service!
Stupid!
What a bad
temper...!
Well... and now that I realize, I'm the
only one here who's playing the fool!
Why?
I'll tell you... You knew Carmen,
as they say, thanks to me...
...and now you've got
your flat, your motorbike...
...two jobs, in one of them you don't
lift a finger... and life's too short...!
You can do the request too, if you like...
"Yes, c'mon... yes..."
Look, there's a vacant job in Malaga... just seize
the opportunity! - Oh, sure... what a devil you are!
Tell me, where's
the store?
Which one? - The matresses'. That
one where they give you a discount...
Hey, you're becoming
bourgeois!
Hey, I wasn't looking! (- Pepe, don't
be upset!) - Don't make me mad...
Don't make me mad or I'll slap you, stupid...! (Pepe! Oh, my
god, what a man...!) - Don't be rude or I'll give one to you...!
- Just dare to do something! Don't insult me or I'll slap you!!
(- But Pepe, let's go home, Pepe, let's leave!) - Hey, the police,
c'mon! - Calm down, come on! Don't be that way!
Don't be that way you
either! (- But Pepe...!)
Let's see... (- Calm down, Pepe!) - ...if you can
explain to me what happened... - This man...
this idiot! He said I was looking at his wife!
But, c'mon! For God's
sake! That's no sin!
What this gentleman maybe wanted... (- Hey, don't insult
me, don't insult me...!) - ...was to pay a compliment to your
wife... (- He's threatening you! Let's go home!)
There are certain looks which can't
be mistaken...! - But don't be that way!
He's been the whole morning undressing her
with his eyes! (- Enough, for God's sake!)
- No, c'mon, he was just looking at her...
If I saw you with these eyes...! (- Let's go home!
Come on, let's leave!) - Let me explain it to you...!
Let's see... Look... What's happened...
...is that your wife
is so beautiful...
...and this man maybe looked at her... (- Sure!) - ...but without
any bad intentions, I think... - Wait a moment! But, who are you?
What are you doing here? Why are you dressed that way?
I'm a Government
employee...
OK, then now you're going
to see who I am! - Yes...
Now the three of us are going to the police station!
- Don't be that way! (- C'mon, Pepe, let's leave!)
Now the three of us are going to the police
station!! - And now you're going to see what
I dare to do...! - No, not with the gun!!
Now the three of us are
going to the police station!
What matters is that you make peace... Shake your hands here...
- But what are you talking about? - Here, right now...
...that the lady is present... (- Come on, Pepe, let's
leave at once!) - Shake your hands here...
...right now...! That's it! Shake your hands...!
- I'd better... I'd better leave because my mind clouds over...!
And mine too!
- Go and jump in a lake!
(C'mon, let's go) - Idiot! - You yobbo! - You're an idiot!
- You yobbo! (- C'mon, let's go at once!) - Idiot!!
I told you a thousand times that I don't know
why you go out with so tight-fitting clothes...
Now it happens to be my fault, doesn't it?
- Of course it's your fault...!
If it's just that you all look at the ladies in such
a way that the husband has to be offended!
Hey! Hey! Excuse me! Excuse me!
Please! Excuse me! - What?
What's the matter? - They're going away without paying the beers!
- Ah, OK, don't you worry... - Why shouldn't I worry? - I'll pay it to you...
Let's see... How much is it?
- 22,50.
22,50...??
They must have drunk the whole kiosk,
otherwise I can't understand it...
Only the beer...
But, what's the matter?? - What's the matter, what's
the matter... It's just that they were discussing!
They start this way and then
end up with a violent crime!
Well, so what?
But, can't you
remember my job?
Ah! Always mind
your own business!
...with the granddad...
Just a minute!
Just a minute!
- You sweetie...
Here it is!
How beautiful it is!
Please help me...
Do you like it?
I love it.
You bought it foam
or spring filled?
No! Spring filled, because the foam
filled ones are very hot in summertime.
Look! Look
how soft it is...!
Where shall
I leave it?
That way! Over there!
- Hey, Amadeo...!
You'll live like a patriarch! - Of course!
- And take out the other one!
One kiss for daddy... - Don't touch
the kid! Wash your hands before...!
There's no danger! It was
one who died of old age...
That one is. - Where's the paper?
- Here, as always.
Are there any news?
Yes, Fabiola's.
Carmen, why are you washing
your stockings in the washbasin...?
Here one can't
find anything...!
Sure! Since you hang all
your things down here...
And where would you like me to hang
them, if they fine me at the terrace...?
And it looked
so big...
I yet told it. The toilet
should be that.
"Besides taking my bedroom out..." (- That's just what
I needed...!) "...you want to put me in the toilet!"
"I'm nothing but Cinderella...!" - And the crime
reports...? - The grandpa must have it! - "A poor man..."
Here you are.
- "...the house." - Yes.
No, no, no! Don't bother! I'll take it myself...
"- I'm a complete nobody..." - Yes, my love, it fell down.
Carmen, give a tip to this man...
- I can't do everything!
Any news...?
No, nothing,
just as usual.
And the whore's
murderer...?
He escaped. Nobody can find him.
- Well, thank goodness!
Hurry up while
putting it...
...for my back... (- Carmen, help me!
- I'm doing it now!) - ...aches so much!
"A receptionist kills his
wife... and a waiter"!
Don't you worry! They
caught them red-handed.
But... but they'll condemn
this one to death!
No, it's just a
matter of honor...
...and there's no problem.
- What do you want?
One with which I got
a terrible fright.
Everyday the newspapers
are causing alarm...!
Yes, but in England he'd be hanged, wouldn't he?
- In England, yes, but here they are softer.
Believe him. - Come on, hurry up, I'm freezing...!
But can't you see that he understands those things...!
Moreover... until the trial starts and all that
lots of things can happen, don't you agree?
Yes, but one of these days... With all
these frights my hair is turning white!
You idiot! What did
infidelity matter to you...?
The problem is that you've
never been to a war!
Father, don't needle
him on top of all that!
If he's trembling and it's the
easiest thing in the world...
A shot in back...
"Tell me, how are you feeling
now, father...?" - Here...
Let's see... - "I'm feeling better, but you
can't imagine the pain I still feel in..." - Yes...
"- In your back...?"
"Yes... - Oh, my God..." - Article... - "OK then,
just use a nice pillow here... - "Yes..."
...Article 449... - "We'll see...
- You can, that's it!..."
"That's OK!... - Are you feeling better...? - Don't move me any
further...! - ...The spouse who kills his wife... - "OK then! Be good!"
...yes... who kills... - Be quiet and try
not to catch cold! - ...who kills his wife...
...and hasn't...
I see...!
That's great!
Don't you think so...?"
This doesn't go out of shape even
with an elephant sleeping on it...!
Hey! Very nice! You're yet
calling me fat, aren't you...?
But I don't weigh that much... - Come here...!
- What do you want...? What are you doing...?
You know what I'd like to do...?
- Hey, get away, don't be a fool...!
Carmen... Shall I
tell you something...?
What?
Shall we
inaugurate it...?
Hey, c'mon! If I have to
make the bed...! Let go of me...!
Ouch!
"Hey, kid..."
Carmen...
Carmen!
You fool...!
But I have to make the pap for
the kid...! - C'mon... c'mon, come...
But, let go of me, José Luis,
don't be a fool...!
Let go of me! You rough! You shameless!
(- Crazy, come here...!)
But my father's over there...!
- But they can't hear us...!
"Hey, kid..."
"Hey, kid...!
Look at grandad..."
Mummy!
"José Luis!"
Mummy!
(- "What are they doing...?)
"José Luis!"
Mummy!
"José Luis...! (- I'm on my way!)
- They're ringing the bell!"
Who is it?
"It's a letter."
Slip it under
the door!
It's registered.
Don José Luis Rodríguez?
Yes.
You have
to sign.
Thank you.
- Here...
Sorry, I was at the toilet. I haven't got my jacket.
(- No problem.) - I'll tip you another day. Bye.
So appropriate...!
"Daddy?"
- Luisito...
...Mummy's coming
soon. Be quiet.
Where are
you going...?
Where is it from?
- From the Ministery.
What does it say...?
But what happens
to you...?
"José Luis..." (- "Carmen!")
- "...but where are you going...?"
"Carmen!"
"But, c'mon, come with me, I'm
getting cold, c'mon, come with me!"
"José Luis...!"
What's the matter?
José Luis, what's the matter?
(- What does it say...?)
What's the matter?
What is it?
Oh, father! They're informing
him that he must kill one...!
Calm down, Calm down!
- Oh, my God, what a misfortune!
And this had to happen right now, when we
were living so happily...! - Calm down!
Don't you cry.
Don't worry.
I'll resign right now.
- Don't you cry... - OK.
You haven't eaten anything, kid...!
- José Luis, come here!
Give me that paper...
- I'm resigning!
There's always
time to resign!
If you resign now
we'll lose the flat...!
...and where should we go...?
- To the street!
But, c'mon,
for god's sake!
Don't believe that!
They'll pardon him!
I've travelled in vain
so many times...!
What's more... You turn up, and if pardon doesn't
arrive, you greet them nicely and then you go off!
No, no, no! I won't greet anybody!
- Carmen, persuade him, for god's sake!
And make him
think about his son!
My darling,
he's right.
If you want to resign, just do it,
don't worry about me!
We'll manage anyhow...
I don't care to be
again a dressmaker...
I see... - Anyway, I think
you should go at least...
Yes, sure! - Furthermore, you'll have
to give back what you earned!
Yes! I'll give
it back...!
Sure! Just tell me how, from where, just tell me...!
- But, what do you want? You want me to be a killer...?
"And where is it...?"
Just don't ask!
It's in Palma de Mallorca...
In Palma de Mallorca... I haven't acted
there. Otherwise I'd give you a card...
Shall I prepare your
clothes...? - No...!
No, no... You've got me into trouble
yet. I don't know what to do...
But, c'mon, my darling, if you want
to resign, I don't care, just resign.
But, if you want to
do it, why not there...
That way, at least,
you'll know Palma...
No! No, no...
I won't go alone...
Maybe if you'd
come with me...
Me...?
OK, I'll go with you
if you like, but...
...but the trip will
be very expensive...
And what shall we
do with the kid...?
To tell the truth, the air from
the sea would do him so good...
Well, what's
the matter...?
Oh, well, we're going together to Palma. Anyway,
we had no honeymoon... - How lucky you are...!
I only went to
sad places...
What do you think? Should I  buy a
new swimsuit, or just take this one...?
But how can you think of
going for a swim now...!!
Hey, sweetie! The one time
I'm going to meet the sea...!
I've never been to
Palma de Mallorca... no...
(Miss, what do you think about Mallorca?) - Take this...
(- Isola molto bella, mondissimo...)
And what's that black
girl doing here...?
I like that one
in green...
She must be of
a mixed race...
Don't you think
so, José Luis...?
And what should I care
about black girls...?
Black girls concern you,
and white ones too!
Don't you realize that with that thing about the
contest it's easier for the pardon to arrive...?
I can remember that once in Cádiz...
- "Please, please, give way..."
...yet many years ago, they pardoned
one during the carnivals... - Oh, really...?
...so just imagine this, which
is something international...
That's true! There's even
a Chinese girl! I see...!
You see...?
Look! Look how beautiful!
And you didn't want to come...!
Oh, yes... c'mon, c'mon,
take care with the kid...!
"This way, ladies, this way..."
- Look! The guards are over there yet!
How the guards...?? - Sure, of course!
Now they'll take you to the jail...
"...way, come on,
give way..."
Well, here
we are...!
The papers!
No! It's here...
my son-in-law...
José Luis!
José Luis!!
José Luis,
please!
Please,
come on!
Stop!
Wait!
Let's go, come on!
(- I'm not going!)
"Watch out, give way, come on,
give way...!" - Let's go...!
I'm not going, I said! - Let's go! The pardon will soon
arrive! - But, which pardon, if they're yet waiting...!
I'm coming back to
Madrid...! - No...!
...That's just common practice...! - Carmen!
Come here, we're leaving right now...!
...it means nothing...!
- OK, OK...!
They're taking you to the jail, but later you
come back...! - "Please... clear way..."
I'm not going!! I don't want
to know anything about it!
Carmen...! Let's leave, please... - Obey him, José Luis! Can't you
see that he has experience...? You're so brute, son...!
Who's the holder
of the flat...?
Who's earning
the salary...?
Come on, don't
be a child!
Well, OK! But you're
coming with me...
If they let me, I'll do
with pleasure...
But I don't think
they'll let me.
Come on, come and let me
do all the talking now...
It's just that my son-in-law thought
that he had forgotten something...
But, hey, who of you is
José Luis Rodríguez...?
He's a bit nervous... - Him.
- Come on, give him the papers...
Here you are.
Shall we wait for
you here...?
No...!
No... Look, Carmen, now you're going
to go to the boarding house...
And we both will
arrive later! - OK.
Amadeo...
- Hey, excuse me...!
...explain it to
him, please...
I yet know it's not common practice... - Please
understand... - ...but I'd like to go with him... - Yes...
...I've been in the trade too...
- No, it's not possible!
You see? I can't.
Come on, go peacefully...
And don't make the
fool of yourself!
Come on, go...
Let's go!
"The case, father...!"
"José Luis...!"
José Luis...
The case...!
And be a man!
Come on, my son,
come on...!
Look! Look how
pretty they are!
Hey, it's
José Luis!
José Luis...! Come on, say goodbye
to him with your little hand...
Goodbye!
- Daddy... daddy...!
Goodbye! - Say it
yourself, darling...!
Here you are, kids, and
please don't disturb!
Hey, excuse me!
The boss asks if that gentleman who
has to arrive will do it now or later...
No, I don't think
he'll come.
But you said
that he was...
What's for lunch?
Seafood casserole. And
bananas for dessert!
Father, you said that
he would come back!
You listened? Seafood casserole!
With prawns, grouper pieces...
...kingprawns... and everything
with a hot sauce...
...that's really mouth-watering! - Listen, this kid's crying
a lot, wouldn't he have sunbathed too much...?
Put his cap
on, c'mon!
Carmen...!
Carmen!
José Luis...!
- Carmen...
How are you...? Are you alright...?
- Tell me, where is the way up? - What?
That way!
Does something happen...?
Where?
- That way!
No! Not by that one!
By the wooden one!
It seems like he's
coming happy...
It's José Luis!
Is he bringing
the case?
Well... Don't
ask me!
I bet he escaped...! We must
call the Guardia Civil...!
The telephone...! - Non capisco
niente. - Where's the telephone...?
The telephone,
madam!
He's ill! I haven't got
to do anything!
Look out! Sorry.
Calm down! - Everything's fix! - Calm down!
- He's ill! Very ill! - Explain yourself!
Explain yourself, come on!
- Nothing will happen!
I think... I think that
he's going to die...!
...otherwise why should they wait...?
- So... we're going back to Madrid...?
Madrid? My foot!
Look...!
The expenses! They told me that I
have to wait to see what happens...
Here you are...
Maybe, if everything goes alright and if it
takes a long time for that man to die...
...we'll be here for a whole month!
- OK, but what did they tell you there?
"Here you are, these
are the expenses..."
"Leave your address and don't leave Palma, OK?"
- It's crystal clear, my son! Wait a moment...!
- Let them prepare... (Give a kiss to dad...!) - ...another
seafood casserole, for the other gentleman has arrived!
Hey, kid...! - Are you happy? - Yes!
Is this boarding house good?
Fantastic! - That's
wonderful! - It's great!
I yet knew that they
wouldn't call you... - Yes!
Casserole for lunch! - Hey you lovely!
- Hey cute! Hey you beautiful! - Look...!
15 pesetas...?
Wow...!
What?
Ah, a photograph! Yes, sure...
yes, yes... Give it to me...
Germanic...?
German...?
So gorgeous...
Down...! Ah, yes,
down, OK...
Done!
Please, miss, would you like to make me
a photograph together with my wife...?
(How much is it...?)
Sorry...
Carmen...!
Carmen... come here. - It's very expensive... - Come here!
This lady is going to make us a photo! - Ah, yes!
Thank you. - Thank you,
thank you very much!
Ah, sure, the
address, to send it!
I live in
Madrid...
...South area, group 4,
block 17, Third Right...
Yes...
"ACHTUNG, ACHTUNG..."
- Third... - Look how beautiful...!
Shall we send it to Álvarez...? - Yes, yes...
It's very beautiful, don't you think so...? - "...LA CUEVA DEL
MAR..." - There's a lot more here... - Yes... You can't miss it!
That's my address in Madrid, and your house... Thank you very much!
- Hey, look at the photos, and try to find the one you like best...
The one that you want, come on! Anyone! This one... this one...
This one is so beautiful... - "...LA CUEVA DEL DRACH..."
But what's the matter
with you...?
What's the matter with you...?
- With me...? What's the matter...?
It's that guy...!
I can't understand a single word he says...!
- Well, while you've been with those dirty ones...
...you've had enough time
to learn languages...!
They're calling us...
Oh, really...?
Let's go... - And how...
how do you know it...?
Because at least I want to, the rest of you are fools... - But how could
I speak it, c'mon! - But, come on, hurry up! - They don't speak Spanish...!
It's so difficult to understand them...!
- No... Ah, yes, we're the last ones, as always...!
Hello...!
Hello...!
Here... Here we'll be so
well... That's it...! Here.
No, c'mon, no!
Let's go further!
Further...?
OK... here.
No! Up to the corner, so
the water can be seen...
Come on, you silly!
It's cooler here!
And this one... I still can't understand
a single word from him...!
I can't either...
But when will they even think to speak
Spanish, come on...! - I think the same...
Are you Spanish...? - Yes, that's why we can't
understand anything... - Just married...? Yes, yes...
Yes...! We have
a child yet...
Later we'll sit down by them in
the coach... - OK, as you wish...
Do you
like it?
Yes, but I'm
scared...
Can't you hear...? The cave
vampire's arriving now...!
You fool...! You
scared me...!
There's too many
people, get away...!
There's too many people, come on!
- And what does it matter...?
Look...
What do they care
about people...?
Wow...
OK, but they're
foreigners...
For foreigners it
seems so natural...
If I ask this girl for a kiss,
she'll give it to me...
Really...?
Sure!
Excuse me,
lady...
Come on... tell it
to her, come on!
You... you are
a foreigner...?
Indonesian...
- Thank you.
You're so silly...! - There they
are catholic, she can't do it...!
Don José Luis Rodríguez...
Don José Luis Rodríguez...
Don José Luis Rodríguez...
Don José Luis Rodríguez...
If present...
...you are required to
go down to the pier...
Don José Luis Rodríguez...
They're calling me...!
Maybe it's just
that he died...
Don José Luis Rodríguez...
If present...
...please be so kind as to
come down to the pier...
Don José Luis Rodríguez...
Don José Luis Rodríguez...!
Please,
Don José Luis Rodríguez...
Did he die...?
What?
Did he die?
Are you
Don José Luis Rodríguez?
This is my wife...
Come with me
to the boat...
Carmen...!
I'm going off...!
"Quiet, please!"
But...
But... but... where are you
going...? I'm going with you...!
- No! (- Sorry...!)
- You stay here!
No, no... I'll go with you!
I won't leave you alone...!
No way! I'll go
with you...!
Stay here
watching the show!
(Hey, he goes on the same...!)
- José Luis...
José Luis...! - Amadeo... your... your... your
father, Carmen... he'd better know it...
But, how can I call him,
if I'm here alone...!
Do what you want... (- Won't they shut
up, already...) - ...but call him inmediately!
And what shall I tell
him when I find him...?
What shall
I tell him...?
Tell him... tell him to go to the
jail as soon as possible...
That's it... He already knows where it is...
- OK, OK. Go peacefully... Don't worry...
They don't know
if he died...?
We've been ordered to take
you to the provincial prison...
Excuse me...
Is this high fine...?
Excuse me...!
I'm asking you if
this high is OK...
I... I just don't know.
Do what you want...
I'm just
waiting...
Please, what
time is it?
It's five
past five.
And the chair...?
No, thanks, I'm alright standing up.
I prefer to go for a walk...
Good heavens!
What a man...!
Almartín! There's somebody
at the visiting room...!
For me...?
No, for the
executioner...
For me...??
For you, yes.
Hey, hey, hey, excuse
me, excuse me...!
Wait, wait... With me...
- It must be Amadeo...!
Calm down!
Calm down!
Calm down...!
- Hurry up, please!
Good morning.
Good morning.
Hello... Hello.
The convicted has said that he
never drank champagne...
And I allowed
myself...
As far as I am concerned,
I see no problem...
Generally, the supplies are brought through the supplies
store, but, in your case, we'll make an exception...
You're so kind... Your so kind,
thank you very much!
We must admit that the poor guy's
behaving with absolute dignity...
Yes... - That's impressive,
really impressive...!
What's up,
Juan...?
Excuse me, My Lord Marquess, it took me so long because the
Marchioness, My Lady had got the keys for the wine cellar...
...and she had to
be woken up...
I see...
I see...
Is it French...?
Yes, Sir.
- Aha...
There must be some ice,
mustn't it?
Well... we'll see... Yes,
I think so, My Lord Marquess...
It's perfect...!
Ideally... - Perfect... - ...we should serve it in a bucket,
don't you think so...? - Anything else, Sir? - Nothing else!
Nothing else... We'll be
done inmediately... - OK.
And who's
that one...?
It's the visit for
the executioner.
Did you call him? - Yes sir.
- Wait a moment, wait a moment...
Wait! Wait...! - Please, I have to speak
for one moment with that man...
"José Luis...!"
A... Amadeo...!
Amadeo...! - What's
the matter, José Luis...?
They made me prepare everything... Come
in...! Come in...! - Calm down! Calm down!
Listen, you must be
calm! - Yes, yes...
I told you many
times...!
The pardon
will arrive!
No! No, no...! It won't arrive! I've... I've asked about
it yet...! Come in, please... - But it doesn't matter...!
That's what they always do...!
- But, how...! - Ah...!
Yes... Don't forget to
tighten the right screw...
...otherwise the iron gadgets
will slip down the stick...
The screw...! But I don't
care about the screw...!
You just wait...!
If you have no courage... - Sir...
- ...you say that you resign!
...let my father-in-law to come in...! - It's not
possible... - This is the real executioner!
The rules are the rules... - But the rules doesn't matter...!
- I told you! You have to wait until the last moment...!
Let him in...
Please don't behave like a woman...!
A woman...? My foot...!
Excuse me, sir...
Be kind...
Open the door
to him...
He... He's been on duty
for forty years... - OK...
He knows the job very well... - Listen...
Listen...! - Now you'll come and have...
...a cup of coffee... - We're waiting for you
at the ship...! - ...and a glass of wine!
We're waiting for you at
the ship, don't forget it...!
After you go out, tell them
to take you there...!
To the ship...!
To the ship,
don't forget it!
Excuse me, sir...
Be a bit patient with him...
- Yes. - ...it's his first time...
Ah...! And tell him not to forget
the screw's... - OK. - Thank you.
Are you feeling sick...? - What...?
- I'm saying that if your feeling sick...
No! I'm alright. What I
just want is to leave...
Now you'll have a
nice glass of wine...
Yes... - Well...
- But it's just that...
Here we are
already.
What?
The convicted...
You don't want
to see him...?
No! No, no, no... I... prefer not to see him...
- But you must do it. It's appropriate. Come on...
Really...? - Of course,
come on, yes...
I can't see anything!
Everything's black...!
If you need anything,
just call me...
Good morning. - Good
morning. - Father...
Do they know anything about the pardon...? - They don't
know anything. They never know when it arrives...
They don't know
anything...
Excuse me, father... father... how does he feel...?
- Calm down, my son, calm down...
Trust the Providence
until the last moment...
Yes, but if he'd phone the Ministery, maybe they'd know it...
- Listen to me... That the father can't find it out...
That comes to Management...
Come on, let's go...
Is it cold...?
Yes, I fetched it at
the patio... - OK.
It's enough yet.
I'd like to know who they are making
a toast for with this champagne...
Let's go...
The coffee's at six. Today's a day
like all the others, OK? - Yes, sir.
Just for you...
Good morning.
A cup, please.
Sit down... Come
on... Sit down.
Is the coffee
ready?
Yes. - One cup
for this man.
Excuse me... is that one
the executioner? - Yes.
What a strange guy...! Hey,
Manuel, bring it yourself...
Hey...
Hey, you...!
How much are you
earning today...?
I killed one and they
gave me this...
Sanmartín! - Yes...
- Look...
So much bothering and now it turns out
that he doesn't want it...! Here you are...
Keep it in the cold-store... - Sure! In this cases brandy is the
best choice... - In this cases the best choice is nothing! - Come...
Thank you.
Hey, Sanmartín...
The judges are over there
yet, take him there...
Well... the moment
has come.
The moment
for what?
For acting...
And the pardon...?
They said that...
But, which pardon...? Come on,
come on, let's go...
No! No, no...
But where are you going...? Tell me...
Where are you going...?
The door, please... The door to...
to the street... - Bah... - Tell me...
I'm going to
Madrid...
I don't want to
know anything...
I have waited until
the last moment...
A... And if they're taking my flat away,
they can keep it. I'm going to Madrid...
Th... The door, please... Where is the way out? - Calm down,
come on! Would you like another cup of brandy...? - No!
...Some coffee...? - No, thanks... A leaf...!
A leaf of paper... - OK. - ...please...!
And take note: The flat, my wife, the
kid... Nothing! We all to the street...
And take note of it,
for I resign.
Ah... And I have to give back the money
I earned then I'll give it back.
I don't want the money...!
- Let's see... what's your name...?
José Luis Rodríguez. But it doesn't
matter, I'm leaving right now...
Men understand each other by
talking to each other, José Luis...
Did they give you some brandy...?
Have you drunk anything...?
Bring the champagne...
Well... - The champagne! - Tell me,
what happens to you...?
Ev... Everything has
been due to the flat...
Since my father-in-law was going to
retire, they wouldn't give it to him...
Your father-in-law...?
- Yes, Amadeo, the executioner...!
(- I see...) - ...40 years on duty! That's why I was
telling you to let him in, do you understand...?
Tell me, tell me...
One cigarette?
Thanks.
Look... what I am
is an undertaker...
...and the girls, you know, they
didn't want to go out with me...
...then Carmen, since she was the executioner's
daughter, it wasn't easy for her either...
No! It's not that I didn't love her...
She had never met the sea...
Then Amadeo,
Carmen's father...
Amadeo caught us... together
in... the bedroom... Yes...
You know, things
that happen...
And, of course, as Carmen
was 6 months pregnant...
...then Amadeo persuaded
me, for not to lose the flat...
A very
nice flat!
A bit far away,
you know?
But since with the motorbike I don't have
to catch the streetcar, I didn't care too much...
Ah...! Then, your father-in-law, when giving up to
be an executioner, would lose the flat... - Yes. As it...
Excuse me,
Sir Director...
Shall we open this bottle? - Excuse me... - It's the
Lord Marquess's - Yes, yes, of course... - Sir Director...
Sir Director... (- Two glasses...) - He said that
it was better for me to continue his job...
...but I didn't want to. What I wanted was
to go to Germany, do you understand...?
My brother, when I married
Carmen, broke off with me...
He didn't talk too much to me before, but at
least he said "good morning", "good night"...
Here you are...
Thank you...
But, since I loved Carmen and she was
about to give birth, Amadeo told me...
A... Amadeo...  - Come on...! - ...persuaded me...
Amadeo persuaded me to present the request...
A... And he told me that, by doing that,
I'd keep the salary and the flat...
...And that, when this
moment would arrive, I...
Sir Director... - Tell me,
tell me... - Yes...
...And he told me that if this
moment arrived I could resign.
Go on, go on...
Yes! But I can't be an executioner! What I want is to
resign...! - But if you resign you'll lose your flat...
Yes, but I don't care about the flat yet!
We... We're all going out into the street!
I... I just want a leaf of paper to write down my
resignation... and... - Just a moment, please... - Yes...
I want to live peacefully
with my wife and my son...
Carmen is a very
good woman...
Look, look, Carmen... And
this is my son... Look...
Here he was three
months old...
And this is Amadeo! The executioner...
40 years on duty... He's just over there...!
...over there, at the Broseta boarding house...!
If you want I'll call him in a moment...
...and he'll come inmediately...! - Look,
the wife and son of the executioner!
...She sure is pretty, yes sir!
- And who's this man...?
"No! No... This one's not from the family,
no... She's a partner of Carmen..."
Prepare the witnesses. If this one starts this way, it won't be
a nice show... - "We made this one at the night festival, when
we were dating... Yes, it's one of, one of those joking ones..."
And we made this one at the baptism
of... - José Luis, my son... - Yes...
You're a man... - Yes...
- ...and I am a man.
The convicted is also a man. - Yes, sure.
- And, between men, what's the convicted's problem...?
The pardon! - No! To finish as
soon as possible... - But, why...?
You say you're asking for your resignation...
- Yes, yes... - I can consult it with the Ministery... - Yes...
...I can try to speak with the superiors
to obtain another executioner.
Yes! Sure!
That's it!
I can do it... - Yes...
- ...of course...
...but you yet know what
the oficial paperwork is...
No, no, I don't know... - The work piles up...
one day passes, two days pass...
...one week passes...
The convicted
can't wait...
A... And why
can't he wait...?
On the other hand,
it's a matter of resignation.
The convicted has made his confession.
He received the Holy Communion...
...with the great edification
of the people.
It's a soul in
the grace of...
...of God!
And who can
ensure...
...that in these days, while
we're waiting for the reply...
...he won't fall again
into desperation...
Do you think it's fair, José Luis...? - No! No, no...
- The convicted can't wait...! - No! No... But, why?
Why can't
he wait...?
Why?
Put him a
tie on...
Just a moment,
come on...
No! No, no...
Let go of me...!
Let's go...
Let's go...!
- No...!
Come on, let's go! - No! - Come on, please!
- Come on, please! - Let go of me! - Get going!
- No! - And now... - Let's go, let's go...!
- No...! - Be calm, come on... - Walk!
Calm down!
- That's it!
But, come on! - Why...?
- Calm down!
Why...? - But you won't even realize... Everything's
so fast... - Put this inside... - Why...?
Come on... - Why...? - Here you are,
take it... that's it... let's go...
Why...?
No...
Well! This man
will get sick...!
Sir Director...!
- Sir Director...!
Doctor!
Come!
What's the matter?
What is it?
Let me pass...
let's see...
José Luis, come on...!
- It's nothing... - It's a dizziness...
No...!
Father... father...!
Come on, José Luis,
don't make a row...!
No...!
Calm down, my son. Be courage!
- Come on, please... - Go on, father...
Help the convicted...
- Yes...
Come on...! Look look at the birdies,
come on, my love, time to eat! Come on...
Give me some
water, father.
Would you like a
little bit water...?
Everything's finished!
He's yet here!
José Luis...!
Thank you.
José Luis...
Have you eaten
something...?
I'm worried. He's been
crying all night.
Come, my love,
come...
Take the kid,
father...
Give me, give
him to me...
Come on! With grandpa...!
- Come with the grandpaaa...! Come on...!
Would you like
a sandwich...?
Hey! There's been
a pay rise!
I won't do it again, do you
understand? I won't do it again!!
That same thing I
said the first time...
Come on, my son,
let's say goodbye!
Say goodbye to them
with your little hand...
Come on...
Good bye!
Come on... You, you... Good bye!
Enjoy! And don't get wet! He he...!
Come on... Let's see, let's see... Wave it...
Good bye, good bye... you beautiful...
The End
