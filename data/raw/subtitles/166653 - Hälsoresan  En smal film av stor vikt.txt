The trouble with humor is
that people think you must be joking
Today, "Tales of
the Swedish Countryside" -
- takes us to the swirling rivers
of the province of Dalecarlia.
Where able-bodied men float
lumber, the gold of the woods.
This is a job for real men!
GRANHEDSGÅRDEN
Authorized Therapeutic Facility
28, 29, 30...
...31, 32, 33, 34...
...and swallow.
- Good morning, Mr Dahlgren.
- Good morning.
- How was your bowel movement?
- It was nice and firm.
- Have you slept well, Gudrun?
- No, I have a terrible headache.
Those are withdrawal symptoms
due to a lack of coffee.
Don't forget our meeting.
There are only two guests this week,
and you know what that means.
Either we go bankrupt,
or we'll have to go with the times.
We also need a new name.
Something with a modern ring to it.
Well, the name
was good enough for Dad.
We must be doing something
wrong, we don't have enough guests.
"The New Granhedsgården"? Kulla-
gården changed its name like that.
THE HEALTH FARM
This movie is based
on countless eye-popping headlines
SOMEWHERE IN SCOTLAND
- Bye.
- Bye.
He's here five times a day,
he must have bulimia.
- I bet it's for his grandchildren.
- I hope so, for his sake.
DIET BREAKTHROUGH
Arne, 57, lost 50 kilos
Hi! I'm Rebecka Melin.
I'm Stig Helmer Olsson.
- Are you throwing a kiddy party?
- No, not exactly...
Okay... See you around.
An "authorized witch"?
We have an appointment
with Ole Bramserud.
Hi there!
- My solicitor, Claes Palmstierna.
- Hello, I'm Ole Bramserud.
- How's the golf game?
- I just don't have the time anymore.
Picture two professional musicians
dressed in chicken suits.
I'll sing the jingle and Niklas
will show you the storyboard.
"Thou free-ranging chicken
thou star of the north"
"Thou tender,
thou tasty and delightful"
Then a voice-over says: "Grace
your table with a Svea Broiler".
Followed by the logo:
Svea Broiler, the Swedish speciality.
- How do you get blue chickens?
- In the computer.
Everything's digital. We'll pan in
and out, and add landscaping -
- and more chickens, if necessary.
That sounds expensive.
We're talking about an additional
300,000 to 400,000.
For extra editing procedures.
Can we really afford an ad campaign
for three million kronor?
- Bold moves for desperate times.
- I hope you know what you're doing.
Were they in mourning?
They wore black.
No, that's the way
admen dress nowadays.
The Tokyo market
was up three percent.
While Frankfurt was down 2,3 %.
- Here's your laundry.
- Hello, Ma.
What are we going to do with you,
Stig Helmer?
You can't stay glued to the TV
like some kind of couch potato.
Just look at you,
you used to be so slim.
You should join "The Poundhunters".
Elsa lost 15 kilos, you know.
Your fingers are all yellow,
have you started smoking?
- That's from the snacks.
- All that junk...
The Stockholm market
took a dive today...
Why are you watching this?
The remote control is broken.
I'll do the vacuuming next week,
but please pick the place up a bit.
She wasn't really right for you.
Bye, take care.
Hi! Could you possibly
give me a hand?
- I'd like to rearrange some stuff.
- Sure.
- Do you have a cat?
- A cat? No...
I thought I heard a cat in distress.
Maybe the sound
came from upstairs.
I don't think it's right
to keep cats in town.
- This is how I live.
- It's nice.
- What's that?
- Whales.
I like to meditate to their songs.
Hear the heartbeat... It's the sound
you heard in the womb.
Please give me a hand with the bed.
There's some
negative energy over here.
Have you heard of Feng Shui?
It's about fields of energy,
ley lines.
Help pull the bed over here a bit.
That's fine.
No, it doesn't feel right.
There's too much
Sha Qi from that corner...
East... No, it's in conflict
with my kuan number.
Let's have another go at it.
Pull it towards you. Be careful, now.
This feels good...
It'll work
if I put a bagua in the corner.
What's your sign?
No, don't tell me...
You're a Taurus, aren't you?
You move like a Taurus.
- What date?
- May 5th.
The fifth day of the fifth month,
what a surprise!
That means you're a romantic
that likes to be in the spotlight.
I don't know about that...
Thanks, please accept
a photograph of your aura.
Put your hand right there.
I'm going to take a picture
of your aura, your magnetic field.
Say cheese! I was only kidding.
That's weird,
you hardly have an aura at all.
Your chakras appear
to be out of harmony.
Your sahasra seems to be blocked.
Your crown chakra...
And you blinked.
- Are you sad about something?
- I'm not exactly happy...
- You should consider therapy.
- I don't know about that...
Think about it.
I could be your coach.
I could be your
personal guidance counselor.
THE POUNDHUNTERS
71 kilos. Wow, you've lost 8 kilos!
That's fantastic!
Could you tell us your secret?
My mother's been visiting for two
weeks now, and she thinks I'm fat -
- so she nags me a lot,
and I clean house to blow off steam.
I guess cleaning is good exercise.
Camilla.
77 kilos.
You've gained two kilos.
Invite your mother to stay!
- How was it?
- Embarassing.
Everyone seems to
lose weight but me.
It's expensive too - 4,000 kronor!
For that you get weighed in public
every two weeks -
- and you get
a skimpy booklet of diet tips.
For 2,000 you can weigh yourself
alone at my place.
I'm going to quit "The Poundhunters"
and start dieting for real.
- 70 kilos?
- It must be a slow news day.
Some ley lines...
A pinch of Sha Qi...
...and some negative energy...
Some Feng Shui...
A splash of therapy...
And the singing of the whales...
Hello, I brought you something
to cheer you up.
Here, it's the very latest thing.
You punch in the numbers here.
Height: 1.9 meters.
Sex: male, right?
- Just step right up.
- On that thing?
Your weight is 102 kilos,
your body mass index is 28.
Recommended dietary intake
6-7 megajoules if sendentary.
10 megajoules if active.
Have a nice day.
Great, isn't it?
And if it doesn't behave itself,
just remove the batteries.
Found yourself a job yet?
- No, I'm too old...
- Too old? Don't give up!
Like I've always said,
life is full of possibilities.
You're a man in the prime of life.
You're just
a trifle too pregnant, that's all.
Is this what you had in mind?
I had pictured something
a bit more humoristic.
Oh... What should we try then?
How about this?
Not bad...
- Do you have chicken suits?
-Yes, this way.
Would you prefer
the kind with an eggshell hat?
- They're very popular.
- No, thank you.
- Cowls or just beaks?
- Cowls, please.
How about accessories?
Like an egg basket that squeaks?
Or an inflatable cock's comb?
- Hi there, Ole.
- Hi there, Stig Helmer.
- I hope these will do.
- They're great. Perfect...
Okay, you guys,
put the costumes on.
Phat!
Your jacket's phat.
Is it vintage?
You know - old.
- I bought it in 1970.
- It's so happening.
Take a look.
We did a spread
for Wallpaper yesterday.
You've always been
a happening guy.
"Thou free-ranging chicken,
thou star of the north"
Cut!
You're standing too close together.
- "Svea Broiler", take 11.
- Playback.
- The mike is showing.
- Take 37.
"One hen per 10 square meters."
We're finished.
Damned European Union...
Pretty soon every chicken
will be entitled to its own bathroom.
The Danes have dumped
the price of broilers.
No...
This won't do...
We're history.
Andwe just bought
two tons of chicken feed, too.
Maybe we should accept
that ridiculous Danish bid.
- Or go into receivership.
- Go bust? I'd rather go to hell.
I've got to cancel our commercial
with that Norwegian guy.
What insurance do we have?
Full coverage.
- Why do you ask?
- In case something should happen.
It's nice to get away from
the rat race, isn't it?
Hi, Roger. Go ahead and torture me.
- You're late. Are you very busy?
- Yeah, with a tricky commercial.
Let's get started
on our regular program.
Good work, Ole.
Slow down on your way back
and bend your elbows.
- Like this?
- Perfect.
Sorry about that, it's my cell phone.
Bramserud Advertising.
What?
You don't...
All right.
Okay...
Well, no more
tricky commercial... Damn!
- What is it?
- My arm is going numb.
That's not good.
My friend's a cardiologist.
- What's that?
- A heart specialist.
- I'm Ole Bramserud.
- I'm Nurse Kristian.
You'll find
Doctor Westerberg over there.
- Ole Bramserud.
- Karin Westerberg.
You're not Swedish, are you?
Your situation isn't serious.
But you are burning yourself out.
- That's trendy.
- You're no longer in your 20s.
Slow down a bit, both
with regard to work and work-outs.
Take walks instead, take a week off
and pamper yourself.
I won't need a walker?
- I've fried you a chicken.
- Don't mention the creatures!
The broiler factory's
giving us trouble.
I'm sorry to hear that.
- What's that?
- I'm dieting.
What is it this time, the pineapple
diet? The stewardess method?
Your phone calls
last longer than your diets!
That stuff smells
like our chicken feed.
How much
do they charge for it?
590 kronor.
Do you know how much it costs
to manufacture it?
2 or 3 kronor, tops!
590 kronor...
For accurate readings, both feet
must be placed on scales.
Body mass index 14. You have
lost 49 kilos. Congratulations.
You weigh 142 kilos.
Your body mass index,
body mass index...
Hands up!
What are you doing?
- Why are you waving a golf club?
- I thought you were a burglar.
Someone broke into
the Lundin's place last week.
Aren't you supposed to eat regularly?
And shouldn't you avoid drinking
concentrated sauces?
That stuff's supposed to be diluted.
Bruno, what should I do?
I can't handle this any more.
Go somewhere, try a week at a spa.
Either that, or we'll just have
to buy a fridge with a time lock.
Good night.
Lift your feet up.
Therapy? Well, I never!
Throwing out good money on therapy
when you're unemployed.
No one in our family has ever done
anything like that. A rest home!
- It's a spa, Ma.
- What's the difference?
I bet that Norwegian friend
of yours is behind this.
Oh no...
The vacuum cleaner's clogged
with cheese oodles again.
They're called
"Cheese Doodles", Ma.
I'll be back at three.
- What should I do with these?
- Send them back to Anderhage.
Don't even mention
the word 'chicken' in the future.
I won't, Boss.
That feels better.
- Are you going to the New Age Fair?
- I'll be working at Granhedsgården.
- Peeling carrots?
- No, they're making the place over.
They're offering a specialty week
called "The Whole Person".
- How much do I owe you?
- 625 plus tax.
- Do you accept credit cards?
- Of course.
- Do you like your new place?
- The vibes are good.
- How are the neighbors?
- One's coming along to the spa.
- Someone sorely in need of therapy.
- Is she?
- Is he?
- He's a bulimic mommy's boy.
- The silent type.
- Out of touch with his feelings.
I'm going to coach him.
It's going to be challenging.
It's my pleasure
to welcome Dr Levander.
I'm sure you're familiar
with his TV shows and books -
- like "Eating the Right Way"
or "I Can Fly".
They'll be on sale at the desk.
- Please go ahead.
- Thank you, Ulla.
Right now, the trend in
holistic medicine is specialty weeks.
The idea is to offer package deals
to massage the soul.
Modern people want more than
just a plate full of raw vegetables.
That is why I made this list -
- of activities that should
be available at a modern spa.
The first heading
is Stress Management -
- with activities such as
Basic Yoga, Tai Chi, Qi Gong -
- Circulation Massage,
Rebirthing, Rosen Therapy -
- Shiatsu Therapy
and Sacred Dancing.
The next heading is Fitness.
This includes Aerobics, Step-up,
Spinning -
- Aqua Aerobics, Mantric Jogging,
Mud packs and Aromatherapy.
A new feature
is underwater speakers -
- that play the song of the dolphins.
The final heading is Experiences:
Cosmology and Mentalism -
- Heart-walks, Walking on
hot coals and Survival courses.
Another new feature is that guests
may bring their pets along -
- to meet a dietician
or a psychologist.
The canine jacuzzi is very popular.
Last, but not least,
we come to the menu.
Our target group expects something
fancier than grated carrots.
We get it.
- Any questions?
- Ping-pong yoga...
- Quiet, Nisse!
- That's Qi Gong.
Their special package deal is called
"The Whole Person".
But you want
to return half as big, right?
- Should we give it a try, you think?
- Yes, you need to diet.
And I need to take it easy.
One week, including meals:
5,000 kronor.
One week, excluding meals:
7,000 kronor.
I don't mean to offend you,
but why don't you go for the fast?
- Aren't you going to fast?
- Nope, doctor's orders.
I need to consume more fat.
I have some kind
of scurvy in reverse.
The next time I see my dietician,
I'll slug him with a pork loin.
But now it's time for dessert.
It may be the last one we ever see.
- What are you doing?
- Scraping my tongue.
It's supposed to make your breath
sweeter, in case you ever get kissed.
- You fall for everything.
- I read about it in a magazine.
- I bought you this.
- What is it?
- A potency patch?
- It enhances potency.
Where do they go, over your eyes?
- That wasn't very nice!
- Take a look at yourself.
Exciting, huh?
By the way, I did your horoscope.
Don't make any crucial
business decisions this month.
What a load of crap!
Are we living in the dark ages?
Lots of major companies consult
astrologers before making decisions.
- Suit yourself. Good-night.
- Kissy, kissy!
Let's slow down a bit.
And then pick up the tempo.
And slow down again.
Changing pace like this
in intervals -
- improves your stamina
and helps burn more fat.
We do have a regular bike,
and the area is very scenic.
I thought we weren't
going to discuss this any more.
By the way, Claes and I are going to
fly over to the broiler factory.
- Will you be home for dinner?
- I'll let you know.
Don't pull anything, like you did
with that rowing machine.
You know I don't like flying.
You should see somebody,
try Dr Levander.
Flying's safer than driving,
and I need to rack up mileage.
I have something to show you.
I have a brilliant idea.
This is my idea.
Did you drag me all the way over
here to show me chicken feed?
You're looking
at five million kronor.
- What do you mean?
- I'll tell you.
Swedes are getting fat from stuffing
their faces with potato chips.
That's when it hit me...
- Diet chips.
- Diet chips?
People can eat all the chips
they want, without the guilt.
What are these chips made out of?
The two tons of chicken feed left
over from our broiler factory.
The factory we're going to unload.
Each bag costs 75 kronor,
and that amounts to...
...a profit of 9, 925 kronor per bag.
- How do we get people to eat it?
- People eat anything.
We threw a party
when I was in college.
We served bowls of "Doggy Delight"
and people gobbled it up.
- "Doggy Delight"?
- Dog food, the dried variety.
It's nothing but a scam,
that's illegal.
No, it isn't.
I had the crap Camilla bought
analyzed, and it's the same stuff.
It consists of the by-products of
fish and some minerals and vitamins.
It's absolutely brilliant, isn't it?
Welcome to
the health-food business!
What will people think about
this hocus-pocus?
And dragging city-folks
into the wild for survival training?!
I don't think so, Ulla. It stinks!
Just look here. Our new ad -
- has booked us solid
for four weeks.
Let people talk!
You take care of the kitchen
and I'll take care of the rest.
Well, what if
Dad had lived to see this?
Well, Dad... I hope they serve
linseeds and bran in heaven.
- Give my best to Camilla.
- Inger...
Do you think you could persuade
Camilla to go to a fat farm?
- She's desperate.
- I'll give her a call.
The chips ought to contain
something Japanese, like seaweed.
And a fat blocker, too.
It's all the rage.
Focus your energy on the factory,
before it ruins us.
Never fear!
Don't shed a tear, my dear
for my sake...
- Here. It's almost time.
- What the hell...?
I thought this was settled,
it will give us publicity.
The two top local papers
will both be there!
- Don't be such a stick in the mud.
- Stop it!
This display of initiative
by Ulla Lundgren -
- has created jobs and put our town
on the map...
... the true spirit of enterprise
that our region needs.
The Gustav Vasa Spa
is now open to the public.
Let's go for some patterning.
Stick your index finger
into the first hole in the dial.
Take a deep breath -
- and declare your affirmation
out loud: "I'm safe in the air".
"I'm safe in the air."
Move your finger to the next hole -
- and repeat the affirmation.
"I'm safe in the air."
Do this twice a day, preferably
in conjunction with meditation.
Meditation?
I'm not into spacey stuff like that.
Just find a quiet moment.
- How's business?
- We're having some ups and downs.
We got stuck with a broiler factory
that isn't going well at all.
But now we're in
the health-food business.
- What about you?
- I can't complain.
There are phobics, hypochondriacs
and people obsessed with their looks.
There's no shortage
of people in trouble.
Bruno and I would like
to discuss collaborating with you.
Guess what?
I bought a pair of rubber pants.
- Are you going to take up diving?
- No, it's to combat cellulite.
- What does Bruno think about that?
- We don't share a bed any more.
- He says that I snore.
- That you snore? Men!
- I'm glad you're going to the spa.
- It's going to be interesting.
But in my opinion, Bruno and Claes
should be the ones to go.
- Overweight men are time bombs.
- Don't say that!
Bruno says
the only exercise he gets -
- is being a pallbearer at funerals
for his fitness-freak friends.
He doesn't want to be
in good shape when he dies.
Well?
"Slim Quick"...
- Who developed it?
- Experts.
- Has it been tested?
- Yes.
It's been tested
extensively on animals.
Diet chips...
It sounds interesting...
VEGANS IN CHICKEN SUITS
RAID MEAT TRANSPORT VAN
Amazing...
Some militant vegans have
attacked another meat shipment.
According to witnesses,
they were dressed in chicken suits.
You're lucky nothing like that
has happened to you.
Chickens!
- What about your vitamins?
- I'll take them later.
Have a nice time at the Gustav Vasa
Spa. Give my best to Inger.
I would have taken you there
in my plane -
- but I've got
a lot of stuff cooking.
That's right, chicken suits.
Just like our commercial.
Isn't that something?
I'm on my way.
95% of Sweden
must be woodlands.
You sure have a lot of gadgets.
A compass, a thermometer...
...a gage for inclines
and one for altitude, and a clock.
Air conditioning, a radio, a GPS
navigation system...
And according to its reading,
we are close to Brännforsen.
- Yes, I know.
- How?
I read the sign over there.
Signs are for cheaters, Stig Helmer.
The Gustav Vasa spa...
Let the torture commence.
Hello, Stig Helmer.
- Hi, I'm Rebecka.
- I'm Ole.
- Did you have a nice trip?
- I got a bit car-sick...
It's probably psychosomatic.
We'll cure you.
See you later.
Therapy, you say?
Lucky you.
- I always overpack.
- That's not excessive.
This is just my small suitcase.
- What a beautiful place!
- Not to mention expensive.
- We could have gone to Barbados.
- He's a food smuggler.
- How can you tell?
- I know the type.
Remember the guy who brought
roast beef in his dressing case?
Someone even stored pancakes
in a container for face cream.
It's incredible!
I'm Ulla, and I'd like to welcome
you to the Gustav Vasa Spa.
We'll start by introducing the staff.
Anna teaches classes in Sacred
Dance, Tai Chi and Qi Gong.
Rebecka is our Shihatsu therapist.
And Rainbow is our vegetarian chef.
Linda is our dietician, and composed
the drink you have received.
And my brother Nils
is a jack of all trades.
We have a few house rules.
This is a drug-free environment.
Toxic substances such as alcohol,
nicotine and caffeine are off limits.
We promote life, not death.
- Fasting gives you bad body odor.
- Your body is cleansing itself.
For others, the increased intake of
roughage may give you gas.
This is because your body is
accustomed to eating dead animals.
This discomfort is reduced
by daily colonic irrigation.
Purchase your own personal nozzle
at the desk.
Write your name on it
so it won't get lost.
Or stolen.
Back down onto the nozzle...
And then you just turn on the hose.
One last thing,
please turn off your cell phones.
It's pretty warm...
It's nice.
Just so we get acquainted -
- I'd like us to take each other
by the hand and sing a song.
That's silly, it's not like
this is kindergarden.
It's just a way of getting
to know each other, Åke.
Rest in peace, dear calorie
Soon you will be eaten
Hidden deep inside of us
Digested and forgotten
It's like being able
to print your own money.
I'm a genius.
We used to only serve
grated, raw vegetables.
- Rainbow has written a cookbook.
- "Esoteric Cuisine".
So Dad's book isn't
good enough anymore?
Did your dad write cookbooks too?
The recipes are very orthodox.
"Gut Feeling"...
Stocks in high-risk projects
in the former East Bloc...
...belong down the drain.
That's all for tonight,
we'll be back in two weeks.
We'll be taking
a critical look at diet aids -
- and how the obese
are taken advantage of.
The "Diet King" will be featured.
He made millions selling useless
pills to overweight Swedes.
Thanks...
I should have put
more pressure on that stock broker.
He's pretty slippery.
Diet chips...
That guy has been irritating me
for quite some time.
Find the manufacturer
and analyze the ingredients.
I'm a bit sceptical
about these kinds of places.
- Are you a believer?
- A believer?
Do you believe
in crystal therapy and horoscopes?
No, but it's fun to see
what places like this are all about.
I came here to take it easy.
To rest.
My friend was going to stay here,
so I decided to tag along.
What do you do when
you're not keeping friends company?
I own a small outfit...
an advertising agency.
"Bramserud Advertising."
- Bramserud, that's me.
- My name is Inger.
I'm considering retirement, though...
Leaving the rat race, reading
some of the books I've bought.
Maybe even take bracing walks.
My ex started taking ten kilometer
walks when he turned 40.
And that was the last
anyone ever saw of him.
- Are you married?
- Not that I recall.
Possibly married to my work,
but we're getting a divorce.
- What about you?
- I'm unmarried...at the moment.
Good morning.
That looks yummy. What is it?
A decoction of broccoli.
The new Italian Cuisine, huh?
- What's this Key Gong stuff?
- It's Qi Gong.
It's a Chinese form of gymnastics,
like karate in slow motion.
There was an emperor
who outlawed martial arts -
- and somebody figured that they
could do the same motions slowly.
"Off with your head!"
"I'm gouging your eyes out."
Karate for snails.
If you practise for years,
you can use your hands and feet -
- to make incredibly bad movies.
Have you seen Rainbow?
I think he went...
...that way.
I think he's in the vegetable garden.
We live in a universal force field.
- It can be measured with a SQUID.
- A squid?
A super-conducting
quantum interference device.
Your aura is a force field and,
as such, attracts energy.
At times, we need
to recharge our batteries.
Hugging a tree will do the trick.
Trees willingly share
their energy with us.
If you feel embarrased,
stand with your back to the tree.
- How exciting!
- In your mind, greet the tree.
Picture yourself inside the tree.
- Feel its roots.
- What the hell...?
Feel how the tree
gets energy from the sun.
No way... Tree hugging!
Well, it's better than nothing.
It's actually kind of nice.
Give me a hug, Stig Helmer!
Hug me!
Let's have our first therapy session
this afternoon.
- Don't wear heavy clothing.
- I won't.
Oh, Ole and I were going to take
a Hungarian mud bath.
Then we'll have
our session after that.
Don't forget to take a shower
after the mud bath.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
You have dandruff.
I'll prepare a conditioner
with lavender and eucalyptus.
I'll also stimulate the acupressure
points on the scalp -
- which counteracts
baldness in the future.
Slices of biodynamic cucumber -
- flush out toxins
and remove wrinkles. There we go.
Relax completely.
I'm going to leave you for awhile.
Make the most out of this session
and exercise your pelvic floor.
Okay, Boss.
I feel like a sandwich.
Rebecka's pretty cute...
...for a witch.
She looks more like an imp.
Tell me about your childhood.
- What was your father like?
- Like most other dads.
But that isn't quite true, he was...
- He had a handicap.
- In what way?
He only had one arm.
He and his brother
had a band together:
"The Olsson Brothers
Dixie Jazz Band".
Henry played the saxophone
and my dad was the drummer.
- Even though he only had one arm?
- It worked pretty well.
- But he couldn't do drum rolls.
- That's understandable.
He invented a gadget.
You're repressed.
Your body stores these conflicts
and makes you tense.
Unexpressed grief and anger turn
into a muscular coat of armor.
You really need to release
some of that aggression.
Just lay down, like that.
And lift your arms up like this.
What's this?
I want you
to try to push me away.
I'll hold on tight
and I want you to push me away.
Here we go... Come on.
- No...
- Come on, give it a go.
There's some broccoli
stuck in your mustache.
- Come on!
- Stop it!
Say you're a wimp!
Come on, say you're a wimp!
Look, Stig Helmer's
getting licked by a girl!
You're the wimp!
What's that?
Nothing, I guess...
- That felt good.
- Good. The energy is good.
There's a lot of aggression
bottled up inside you.
You're an unusual man,
Stig Helmer.
You're an only child, aren't you?
Did you play ball with the kids
in the neighborhood?
Yes, but I wasn't very good.
If you're going to be a goalpost,
you can't move around.
- How does it feel to fast?
- I feel a bit dizzy.
That's because of the toxins
that are being eliminated.
I bet you ate a lot of junk food.
Hot dogs, and stuff like that.
Last night I had the strangest dream.
I'm Ole, the king-sized hot dog!
Eat me if you dare!
I'm so wonderfully greasy...
Eat me!
You shouldn't eat anything
that has eyes and can bear young.
I never thought of it that way.
- You're a vegetarian then?
- No, a fruitarian.
- Fruitarian?
- I only eat fruit.
The richest food I eat is bananas.
But I don't eat bananas either,
for other reasons.
You know, because of
United Fruit and pesticides.
- It's so beautiful here...
- It is.
Evenings like this make me long to
be back in Norrland.
- What city are you from up north?
- Härnösand.
Those aqua gymnastics
wore me out.
Are you going to iron?
What a busy bee!
- What's that?
- Wait and see.
Presto - espresso!
Great!
I was dying for some coffee.
Right, enough is enough.
That Norwegian
guy seems very nice.
What, are you dumping the
survival course instructor unseen?
I don't know...
- Bruno's on the phone all the time.
- He and Claes are up to something.
Did you know that the Yanks spend
30 times more a year on dieting -
- than the UN spends on fighting
starvation.
How's our project going?
Brilliantly! 30,000 packages.
Have you given any thought to my
radical solution for the factory?
Yes. In my opinion, you're short
on morals and long on imagination.
- What of it?
- It's against the law!
You have to help,
you're in as deep as me.
Wimp!
- Yes.
- Could you go pick the guru up?
He's arriving
on the two o'clock train.
- What does he look like?
- Oriental, I suppose.
Right, six feet tall and blond.
What do I know?
Make a sign and hold it up.
- I wonder if it's ball-room dancing?
- Hardly. Do you like to dance?
I was the Fred Astaire
of Oslo some 15 to 20 kilos ago.
- Do you?
- Yes, if I get to pick my partner.
I don't like it when strange men
fondle me like it was their right.
But I can always
make an exception...
This is going to be interesting.
Ginger Rogers must have been
a better dancer than Astaire.
She did the same moves,
only backwards and in high-heels.
Why did you come along
if you're going to be so negative?
Because we paid a hell of a lot
for this week.
And you suggested it.
Good morning.
We'll start out
with breathing exercises.
Place one hand on your stomach,
and the other on you back.
Take a deep breath -
- all the way down
to your pelvic floor.
Envision a string running all the way
through your body -
- and passing out through the top
of your head off into the cosmos.
You're suspended on the string, and
you twirl upwards to the heavens.
Take a breath...
Relax your arms and let them dangle.
The first phase is the flow.
Each movement is followed by
a new movement.
It's like Tai Chi, an eternal loop.
It goes on and on...
Take a breath.
The next phase is chaos.
Let your feelings out.
- Father no speak Swedish.
- Is he a yoga teacher?
We have come to pick berries.
Gustav Vasa?
This guy thinks
I'm the old king Gustav Vasa.
Excuse me...
- Viswanathan Raj?
- Gustav Vasa?
Right, Gustav Vasa.
Don't close your eyes
to the invisible.
He who looks outside is dreaming.
He who looks inside awakens.
Oh, my...
- I've never seen anything like it.
- Like what?
Something's happened to you,
Stig Helmer.
Your crown chakra is demonstrating
great cosmic energy.
A red aura signifies the seventh
sense of change and psychic power.
You're heading in a new direction.
And you blinked...
- Would you like mine?
- No, thank you.
What goal did you have this week?
I hoped to get rid of this...
I weighed myself this morning.
- I've gained 20 grams.
- Really?
I must be the only person on Earth
who gains weight on a fast.
Are you going to
do the survival course?
- I wonder what it involves.
- Yeah!
I feel like a new human being,
not a chicken in days.
- Did you eat too much chicken?
- It's a long story.
- I'm really dreading this.
- It's only for a few days.
It's interesting.
I've done it a few times.
- You face the real you.
- I hope she's skinny.
"Praeparatus supervivat",
or "The prepared will survive".
We'll spend a couple of days
in the wilderness.
And your only tool will be a knife.
Please empty your pockets
and place your belongings in the bag.
Camilla!
- Here's a knife.
- Thank you.
Your knife.
Anything else? What is that?
A GPS navigator.
- For satellite positioning.
- Take a knife.
- May I take two?
- No.
We're going to have an easy
run on the river in a kajak.
I suggest that you pair off.
Keep your kajak on course and
paddle where the water is most swift.
That's where it's the deepest.
Okay, men.
You get to head the expedition.
- Let's launch the next bunch.
- Move it, Jan.
Good luck!
- It looks pretty unsteady.
- Try to paddle in time.
- Grab the oars, Åke.
- Take it easy.
This is a message
from Svensk Hydro.
The power plant at Storforsen
will open its floodgates at 1 pm.
This presents a danger
to anyone on the river.
Oh, my God!
Here you go.
Hello... What?!
What are the names of the guys
paddling off in the distance?
Stig Helmer and Ole,
come back here!
- What's going on?
- The floodgates are open.
Wait here, I'll go to the rapids.
- There seems to be a lot of water.
- Don't break the rhythm!
Hold on, Stig Helmer!
No, there's not a trace of them.
They've probably
gotten further downstream.
"An easy run", sure!
I'm never going to do this again.
Have the rest of the gang
backed out?
That leaves the two of us, then.
Talk about a survival course!
- What's the challenging run like?
- You don't get a paddle.
A big steak with french fries
wouldn't hurt right now.
But not for you, you're fasting.
I'm sorry...
They'll find us soon.
They have heat-detecting cameras.
Look!
Lingonberries.
No, these are bearberries.
Arctostaphylos.
This is edible, it's a fern.
Polypodium.
- Where did you learn all this?
- I was a Boy Scout.
"The Beaver Patrol".
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
All that's missing is the cucumber...
We need to dry our clothes.
Did you happen to learn
about making fire?
The glass lenses of our wristwatches,
sandwiched with some water -
- will make a magnifying glass.
Then all we need is
to gather some shelf fungi.
Fomes fomentarius.
Do you know the Latin names
of all kinds of plants?
Just the ones we needed to learn
to earn the "Woodcraft Badge".
The police just called.
They couldn't see them
from the helicopter.
If you say "I told you so",
I'll throttle you!
The kajak was found
at Brännforsen.
That's 60 kilometers from here!
Here...
- What's today's special?
- Shoots of pine.
Some sourgrass, chanterelle
mushrooms and pine gum.
- And all this is edible?
- The gum is like chewing gum.
It will help ward off hunger pains -
- while the shoots and sourgrass
contain a lot of vitamin C.
You didn't happen to find a bottle
of Chablis premier Cru 1982, too?
What a day!
Too bad it wasn't sunny, we'll have
to try the lenses some other time.
I can tell
that you enjoy the outdoors.
I liked going on hikes.
I liked going
on trips with the Boy Scouts.
I used to play
in the forest when I was a kid.
I haven't seen you
this happy for a long time.
But I don't think
it's all thanks to the forest.
I bet Rebecka has
something to do with it, too.
She's a fun person,
but she is a bit odd.
You suit each other.
You're a fun person, too,
but you are a bit odd.
What a strange week this has been.
But they're out there somewhere...
I think.
Isn't that typical? As soon as you
meet a nice man, he disappears.
- Body lotion?
- Not exactly, it's whiskey.
For emergencies.
Did you bring everything?
The cans of spraypaint and stuff?
- Do we have to do this?
- Yes. Put on your gloves.
Remember,
you haven't seen a thing.
Look, they'll see us
with the surveillance cameras.
That's the point.
That's why we're wearing the suits.
- Put your nose on.
- It's a beak.
Look!
It's Big Bird!
Well, they're not exactly minks.
We have to get them out
before we blow the joint up.
But weren't we going to
blow the car up?
There's not much insurance
on that old wreck. Come on!
Go spray some message on
the truck, that's what they do.
What are you doing?
- I was gong to write "swine".
- It's a broiler transport!
Write something like "murderers".
"Smurderers..."
- What should we do with these?
- Stuff them in that bag for now.
Hold on, because it's going to blow!
What a blast!
I've been in the wrong business.
Talk about raising the roof!
What are you fooling around with?
- What are you fooling around with?
- Nothing.
Stig Helmer, wake up!
Listen...
Maybe they're looking for us.
Wave!
This is a good spot
to dump the stuff.
This is a good spot
to dump the stuff!
Did you see that? It might be food.
That yellow stuff looks familiar.
Hunger is making me hallucinate.
Wake me up...
Aren't these the suits I bought...?
Somebody up there's pulling our leg.
Well, at least these
are warm and dry. Aren't you cold?
Could it make any difference
what you wear in a nightmare?
Militant vegans blew up
a broiler factory in Österåsen.
The police have no leads as yet.
That would be Bruno's factory!
Two people
appear to have died in the rapids.
Their kajak was found below
the falls. Over to the Sports Desk.
I know they're alive. I can feel it!
Blasted mosquitos!
Maybe we should put on the hoods?
Why not?
This must be a dandy of a diet.
- It would make business sense.
- What?
Bramserud & Olsson
Botanical Expeditions Inc.
- Should we try that way?
- No, let's go straight ahead.
Finally, traces of civilization.
The trouble is,
which way should we go?
- Let's go south.
- How would you know that?
I checked out the anthill.
Anthills are
always bigger to the south.
You are absolutely incredible,
"Beaver".
What a strange country.
There are no berries,
just weird people.
Let's go home!
Do you have any other bright ideas?
Like going north?
Look!
It's those militant vegans.
Fire a warning shot
and I'll call the police.
- Are they shooting at us?
- I sure hope that's not a bird dog.
You've probably seen this man,
Dr B. Levander -
- in situations where he can profit
from our phobias and hypochondria.
Recently, he's made
a foray into the diet industry -
- with the product "Slim Quick".
Let's consult our panel.
- Rune, you're a veterinarian.
- What's do you think of the product?
- It's an excellent product...
For chickens
that need to gain weight.
In addition to fish by-products,
our analysis revealed the presence -
- of the antibiotic coccidiostatika -
- which prevents parasites
in chickens.
Thank you, Rune.
"Slim Quick" is manufactured
by Bruno Anderhage -
- the owner of Svea Broiler.
We heartily recommend
the product "Slim Quick" -
- to people who are
chicken-hearted and birdbrained.
Down the drain it goes!
Next time...
- I knew it...
- Hush!
I don't want
to hear a peep out of you.
- Anderhage, here.
- It's about your insurance.
- Terrorist attacks aren't covered.
- They're a "force majeure".
- So we're not covered.
- In accordance with item 71.
Tell your CEO
that we're going to appeal.
- I am the CEO.
- You are the CEO...
Idiots!
I'll be going now...
to the police station.
To turn the two of us in.
It's just as well...
And I hope I never
have to see you again...
...Bruno Asshole!
What a wimp!
This is the police speaking.
Lay face down on the ground
with your arms over your heads.
Don't worry, Stig Helmer. They
probably just want to see some ID.
- Come in.
- They've been found!
- I knew it! How are they?
- Fine, I think.
They'll be here soon.
Here they come!
Oh, here they come!
- What on earth are they wearing?
- Stockholmers!
They think they're so superior.
I'm so glad you're alive.
- But why are you dressed like that?
- I don't know.
You'll have to ask Ole,
but I don't think he knows either.
We've been so worried.
- Why are you in chicken suits?
- There's no sensible explanation.
Hello, darling.
Guess what?
I'm going to quit dieting forever.
You have to learn to love the person
you are, Visnawathan said.
He's a guru.
How have you been doing?
Just dandy...
Minus 22 kilos,
and plus 73 hours of therapy later
I take great pleasure in presenting -
- one of the most accomplished
disciples of Visnawathan Raj.
Recently returned from a yoga center
in Nepal - Krishnamacharays!
Give him a big hand!
He was known previously
as Stig Helmer Olsson.
He who looks outwards is dreaming.
He who looks inwards awakens.
Lift your feet, Krishnamacharays.
What's the Latin name
for chickenberries?
It's "Cornus Suecia".
What about
this chubby stonecrop, then?
You don't know?
It's called "Sedum".
The herb of love, the livelong...
What's its name in Latin?
It's "Sedum telephium".
Wake up, Stig Helmer...
Wake up...
- Good morning.
- Hi there.
- You were talking in your sleep.
- I had such a strange dream.
Good morning!
BRAMSERUD & OLSSON
BOTANICAL EXPEDITIONS INC
- What's the plan for today?
- We should hike to Blåfjället.
It's a great locality for Angelica
Arcangelica, Mountain Angelica.
- It'll take us a while...
- It sounds too challenging.
Don't worry... I'll coach you.
