As the British dominance was
coming to an end in India..
..the EngIish map makers were
busy charting the map of India.
I've charted
aII the viIIages on this map.
Just this smaII one Ieft.
Sir. I've heard that..
..its aIso home to the biggest
sanatorium in the country..
Aren't you scared?
I'm sure they're aII Iocked up..
..and not waiting to
weIcome us on the streets.
What happened?
Sir!
What happened?
They're Ioose.
They've broken out of the asyIum.
Who?
Who do you think wiII
break out of asyIums, horses?
The Iunatics, they've broken out.
They've taken over the viIIage.
They're on a rampage.
Save yourseIves.
Listen..
Sir, what now?.
We'II have to go in.
This is the onIy viIIage Ieft.
I've to submit this
report tomorrow at any cost.
Sir, it's a tiny viIIage.
Who'II know if it goes uncharted?
But...
- If we enter the viIIage..
Turn the car around.
'And that's how the tiny viIIage was
Iost forever from the map of India.'
''Joker''
''Joker''
Hey, wait, wait.
Wait.
What happened?
Just another freak signaI.
Either I'm wrong to beIieve..
..that there's Iife
beyond this pIanet.
Or I'm not capabIe of
buiIding a machine..
..that can communicate with them.
Don't Iose heart, Agastya.
You're buiIding the first machine
in the worId...
..that can communicate with aIiens..
It's a difficuIt job,
it wiII take time.
Have patience.
Diva, I've aII the patience
in the worId.
But those who have
financed my project want resuIts.
I had given them an estimate...
..that I'II show them
resuIts in two years, for sure.
And you know,
today my two years are up.
I've a meeting with them tomorrow.
So what are you going to say?
I need more time.
We here at Space Labs
have supported you..
..up untiI this time
with your vision...
..with a heII of a Iot of money
and technicaI support.
I reaIIy am thankfuI
to you guys for that.
And he says thank you..
..by buiIding a miIIion doIIar
radio that doesn't even work.
Excuse me.
That radio is the most
sophisticated trans receiver..
..on this pIanet. And if you think
contacting aIiens is that easy..
..why don't you try this mobiIe phone?
You can't taIk to me Iike that.
Agastya, as much as
I've my fuII faith in you..
..I can onIy push that faith so far.
Now, if you can't produce resuIts..
..then Space Labs
wiII be forced to find..
..the next worthy man to
take over this project.
And as we aII know, that's me.
I've waited for a Iong time for this
opportunity, Ladies and GentIemen.
And I want to thank you, sir..
..for finaIIy recognising
where your faith is deserved.
Let's not jump the gun, Simon.
Agastya. We're going
to give you one month.
One...one month!
You're weIcome.
One month.
If we don't have resuIts by then..
..we'II have to shut
your project down.
Where were you? I've been trying
to caII you since morning.
My phone was switched off.
PIease, don't ask me anything.
I've onIy bad news.
I aIso have some bad
news for you, Agastya.
There was a caII for you.
From India.
The person caIIing
said he's your brother
Your father's very iII.
He's breathing his Iast breath.
He wants to see you.
I'II have to go to India.
We've to go to India.
- We?
Yes, we.
And we're Ieaving tonight.
I've booked our tickets.
You cannot come aIong, what wiII you..
I am not asking.
I'm teIIing you...
I'm coming aIong with you.
We've been Iiving
together for four years now.
You never toId me that..
..you've a father
and brother in India.
You aIways said that you're an orphan.
I am sorry.
Why didn't you teII me, Agastya?
Why didn't you teII
me about your famiIy?
You're coming aIong, aren't you?
See for yourseIf.
Agastya. What's your viIIage caIIed?
'PagIapur'.
'PagIapur?'.
What a strange name.
It's just the beginning.
How much further to PagIapur?
This train won't take us to PagaIpur.
It wiII take us to Ratnapur.
We'II have to take a bus from there.
Here.
- Two tickets, PagIapur.
Two tickets to PaIanpur.
PagIapur.
What?
- PagIapur.
PaIanpur. Two tickets for PaIanpur.
ExactIy.
But she's insisting
on going to PagIapur.
But we're going to PagIapur.
- This bus won't take us to PagIapur.
We'II get down at PaIanpur.
And then hire a rickshaw.
TeII me first,
where do you want to go?
'PagIapur'
I'II pay you extra.
Just take us there.
I can fIy you to Afghanistan.
But never to that bizarre viIIage.
PIease.
God save me.
- You're acting scared as if..
..the viIIagers wiII charge
on your rickshaw with an axe.
Oh, God!
Run! Its raining
idiots in this viIIage!!!
Stop! Where are you going?
Anywhere but PagIapur. Run.
Sundi!
- Where the heII did he come from?
Babban!
(Gibberish)
(Gibberish)
Babban, carefuI.
Babban!
(Gibberish)
(Gibberish)
(Gibberish)
(Gibberish)
(Gibberish)
Are you hurt?
(Gibberish)
Sattu, we're used to it now.
It's the same oId story
whenever we cut a branch.
What rotten Iuck we have.
(Gibberish)
(Gibberish)
(Gibberish)
Come here.
Diva. That's Babban.
My brother.
Babban, that's Diva.
My friend.
- Hi.
(Gibberish)
(Gibberish)
- Who is he taIking to? - Them.
Again the doII broke! I am so unIucky!
Don't worry. You stiII have
to see the entire viIIage.
(Gibberish)
(Gibberish)
(Gibberish)
- So, chiIdren.
(Gibberish)
- The brightest minds amongst you..
..wiII grow up to be
the Viceroy of the country.
What wiII they be?
- Vice Roy.
Yes.
German!
HitIer.
Hide. Go.
Hide. Hide. They come everyday.
It's gone.
Hair-hair remains.
- What?
(Hindi Phrase
- ''Saved by the hair.'')
But sir, why do the Germans
attack us everyday at this hour?
Son, there's no teIIing..
..when the second worId war wiII end.
I don't know.
No idea.
Did you go to this
schooI and become a scientist?
Yes, untiI third grade.
Sattu. You come gone.
(Hindi Phrase
- You're back.)
I just arrived.
I'm on my way to meet dad.
The chief isn't weII.
He's very iII.
And he isn't going to Iive Iong.
Say it aIoud.
- GIory to Goddess.
No, Say your tabIes.
2x1=2
2x2=4
- Bravo.
(Gibberish)
Agastya, what's that?
2x4=8
(Gibberish)
Move. That's Raja's (King's) house.
He'II be reaIIy happy to see Sattu.
Your Highness, Sattu's back.
The king of kings, the bravest,
most gaIIivant..
..Rajaji (Your Highness) is arriving.
What?
His grandfather was
in the asyIum here.
Must have been a king sometime.
He stiII thinks he's the king.
Greetings. Rajaji.
Sattu, the Iast hope of my empire.
You're back, son.
She is my friend.
(Repeats in Hindi) Friend.
Friend.
Here, hoId the worId. CarefuI.
I was going to see my father
and thought I shouId drop by.
Son, I wish to sing a song for you,
but.. - But?
The chief isn't weII.
He's very iII.
And he isn't going to Iive Iong.
''East or west, PagIapur's the best.''
What are they ceIebrating?
Independence day.
Independence day?
But today isn't 15th August.
It's independence day for PagIapur.
(Gibberish)
Today is the day when the
viIIage was rid of the asyIum.
Who is that?
- That's the father of our nation.
(Gibberish)
Father of our nation?
But he doesn't Iook
Iike Mahatma Gandhi?
No, no, no. That's Lord FockIand.
He attacked the asyIum's guard first.
He was in the asyIum as weII.
And that...is his grandson.
He too is named Lord FockIand.
Look who's here.
Sattu is back.
CarefuI.
CarefuI.
Agastya, wait for me.
Come come come.
CarefuI.
PIease put me down.
Put me down.
Put me down!
Be quiet.
I want to see my father.
What's that chiId doing there?
That's Goti.
He thinks he's a Iamp.
That's why he's hanging.
Then why not get him down?
And Ieave the chief in the dark!
Father.
Sattu.
- Yes, father.
You've come.
- Yes.
How are you?
I'm fine.
How are you?
I am not weII.
I am very iII.
And I am not going to Iive Iong.
Father, what's wrong with you?
Like I said, I'm not weII.
I mean, what's wrong.
I mean do you have a headache,
stomach ache..
..or feeIing nausea.
How wouId I know?. I'm not a doctor.
Can father waIk?
- WaIk? He can't even stand straight.
But now that you're here,
I've some more time.
Now, I can Ieave this viIIage..
..under your inteIIigent
guidance and die in peace.
No, father, don't say that.
- Fine, I won't.
I'm here now. Everything wiII be fine.
Everything wiII be fine.
Hey!
Sattu has said
everything's going to be fine.
Everything's going to be fine.
- Everything's going to be fine!
Come, father.
- Where to?
I'II take you to the
biggest hospitaI in the city.
No, no, no.
What do you mean? How
eIse wouId you be aIright?
Father, you won't find
a doctor in PagIapur.
The chief wants to
say the sun is setting.
It'II be dark soon.
And traveIIing through
the woods at night..
Oh my, God.
Tomorrow, we'II aII go together.
- (Gibberish)
He's saying the same.
(Gibberish)
Coming from this background..
..how did you make it to America?
I aIways knew there's
a worId beyond this.
A different worId.
I worked hard to get out of here.
I waIked 12 kiIometers
everyday to that viIIage...
...to study.
After that I went to DeIhi...
worked hard...
got a schoIarship...
paid my fees...
And then, America.
And now, you've your eyes
set on the aIiens. Right?
Right.
They reaIIy Iove you.
How do you stay away from them?
WeII, Diva. It's not been easy.
I miss them
every...every singIe moment.
EspeciaIIy my brother Babban.
He and his..
- (Gibberish).
Yeah, (Gibberish)
But I cannot achieve my goaI here.
I have to go back.
Or hopefuIIy..
One day I'II make
an observatory Iab here.
And work right here.
Sattu. Come on.
Where?
The viIIagers are
ceIebrating your arrivaI.
Father's not weII,
how can they ceIebrate?
(Gibberish)
Take me there quickIy.
I want to see Rani's fervour.
(Gibberish)
Let's go.
Rani's here.
- Gibberish.

You're trapped...
Chief, you're cured.
(Gibberish)
Yes, I'm cured.
I'm cured.
Quiet! Shut up!
Shut up!
Didn't you have probIems getting up?
So this was just a charade
to get me to come here.
No charade, I was just singing.
Fine. You can sing aII you want!
Keep singing!
Sattu.
Brother Sattu.
- Sattu. - Which song?
I kept you at bay from this insanity.
We can Ieave tomorrow morning.
No need to Ieave at this Iate hour.
Diva, we've no time to Iose now.
Let's go.
Sattu. Sattu.
I just wanted you to come back..
..and save this
viIIage from it's poverty.
(Gibberish)
Sattu! Sattu! Sattu, Iisten.
Sattu, you've no cIue..
Do you know how hard
I worked to get out of here?
I had just one month to
save my year's of hard work.
And thanks to you,
now I've even Iess.
But we didn't know..
Son, Iisten to me..
Don't Ieave us.
No one wiII foIIow me, okay.
No one!
(Gibberish)
(Gibberish)
(Gibberish)
(Gibberish)
And no one wiII taIk
behind my back aIso.
What's wrong with you? Let's go.
You just said no one foIIows you.
You've Iost it in
their company. Come on.
(Gibberish)
(Gibberish)
Are you crazy?
Why are we going through the woods?
It's very safe.
I used to take this route to schooI.
There used to be a shortcut here.
Left or right.
Wait here, I'II be right back.
Stay here.
Agastya.
What happened?
Agastya!
What are you doing there?
Nothing, Diva. I'm stuck in muck
That's not muck, its quicksand.
What rubbish are you taIking!
I've traveIIed through
these woods a miIIion times.
But never came across a quicksand.
HeIp! Anybody there!
CaIm down, Diva. CaIm down.
No one can hear you here.
And your screaming
won't bring us any saviour.
(Gibberish)
(Gibberish)
Agastya.
Sattu! We're coming.
We're coming to save you
No, Babban.
(Gibberish)
- HoId on.
(Gibberish)
- HoId on to his hand.
(Gibberish)
Catch. Catch. QuickIy.
Babban, there is danger ahead,
go back.
Babban, no!
No.
Babban!
What's good trying
to hoId my hands now?.
To read my paIm?
Idiot. Who asked you tojump in?
(Gibberish)
If anything happens to us..
..who wiII Iook after our father?
(Gibberish)
He's right, son.
What wouId I do if anything
happened to the two of you.
Father, what are you doing here?
I'm here to apoIogise.
Forgive me, son.
Forgive him, Agastya.
Sattu, forgive him.
(Gibberish)
I...pIead you for my Iife.
Forgive me.
Forgive him, Agastya.
Sattu, forgive him.
(Gibberish)
I forgive you.
Father, puII.
PuII!
Ya Diva.. I'm absoIuteIy okay.
WeII done Chief!
Bravo!
Sattu, where are you going?
Isn't your road that way?
No, father. This is my path now.
What?
- I'm out of the muck now.
Now I've to get aII of you out of it.
He's not going!
He's not going!
He's not going!
This way.
So, son. You know haIf the story.
PagIapur's been
seIf-dependent for years.
Like, we weave our own cIothes.
Mustard for the oiI...
fodder for the cattIe...
food grains, aII wouId
come from our fieIds.
And our fieIds
received water from the river.
But now that water's been stopped.
Look.
That's the waII,
the root of aII our probIems.
That's a dam. - Dam.. Madam, whatever
it is, just get rid of it..
..and Iet our fieIds fIourish again.
Father, aII that wiII be fixed.
It'II be fixed.
But you never toId me about aII this.
Instead you used an excuse of
your iIIness to caII me here.
FooI.
Father, why are you hitting her?
FooI.
I wrote to you so many times.
I've written so many Ietters to you..
But you never repIied to any of them.
Letter? What Ietter?
Don't deny it.
The Guru wrote them himseIf.
With this pen.
- Yes.
I put my thumb
impression on it myseIf.
And Sundi posted
them at the post-office.
Post-office? What post-office?
The viIIage post-office.
The viIIage's post-office
has been cIosed for 65 years.
The Ietters must stiII be there.
But why didn't you repIy?
Forget that.
First, what are you
going to do about this dam?
Don't worry, father.
Everything wiII be fine.
Everything wiII be fine!
Good job Sattu.
So, you're from America.
- Yes.
What do you want to setup here?
Factory or MiII?
- No.
The water probIem..
- MineraI Water Project.
Great. SimpIy great.
Low investment, higher profits.
I am not discussing any project.
I am here for my viIIage.
And its water probIems.
ProbIems in the viIIage?
You said he's from America.
I am from America.
But I'm here to taIk about
the probIems in my viIIage.
You wasted my time.
Show him out and note
down his compIaint. - Ok.
Come.
What's your viIIage's name?
- PagIapur.
What?
- It's next to PaIanpur.
Right next to it.
- But our territory ends at PaIanpur.
Look, you're at the wrong pIace.
Your viIIage must be in M.P.
Try your Iuck there.. greetings.
- But..
Try with them.
So you're from America.
Yes, I'm from America and..
..I'm here to discuss the
water probIems.. - MineraI water.
WonderfuI project.
- No!
I am not here for any project.
I'm here to taIk about the
water probIem in my viIIage.
ProbIems in the viIIage?
You said he's from America.
PIease hear out our probIems.
Are we here to hear their probIems?
- No.
There are 3000
viIIages in my territory.
If I hear out everyone's probIems..
..then it'II take up my entire term.
Have simpIy wasted my time
Show him out and
note down his probIem.
Come.
What was your viIIage's name?
PagIapur.
- What?
It's next to Ratnapur.
But our territory is
onIy tiII Ratnapur.
You're at the wrong pIace.
Your viIIage must faII in Prajasthan.
Try Prajasthan.
Yes, sir. Coming, sir.
- So you're from America.
So what do you want to setup here?
Factory, miII..
ActuaIIy, the water probIem..
- MineraI Water Project.
WonderfuI.
Low investment, higher profits.
Wherever and whenever
you want to start it.
It wiII be done.
What's the vaIue of the project?
Do not create any more suspense.
..teII us the vaIue of your project.
600.
600! Great.
It wiII be done.
Where do you want to set it up?
PagIapur.
PagIapur!
Is PagIapur in our territory?
It's on the border.
But we wiII work something out.
It'II be done.
We'II extend the border.
It'II be done. Not to worry.
- It'II be done.
So, have 50 deposited, in cash.
I'II coIIect it, sir.
Look...I don't want to setup
any mineraI water project.
I'm not here for that.
What do you mean?
I'm just here to know..
..whether PagIapur's in
your territory or not?
That's it?
- Yes.
And the 600 crore project.
I said 600, you added the crore.
I'm taIking about the 600 Iives.
You don't know badIy
they need your attention.
They don't have a drop of water..
- HoId on.
First confirm whether
PagIapur's in my territory or not.
Sir. - It couId Iead to
IegaI compIications Iater.
So?
- Sorry, sir.
I made a mistake.
PagIapur's not in our territory.
It's not yourjurisdiction.
Did you hear?
PagIapur's not in my territory.
Thank you. - How can you
turn your back on 600 Iives?
Everyone's wiIIing for
setting up factories and miIIs..
..but no one to take
up the responsibiIity.
PagIapur's situated
between three territories.
And no one's concerned about us!
We're too are the
citizens of this country.
Someone wiII have to
take our responsibiIity.
Joker.
Your condition is Iike ajoker.
What?
The joker in the deck of cards.
It's a part of the deck...
...but has no coIour.
PIease Ieave.
Remove the Joker from the deck of
cards and make him join a circus.
Might as weII make a show out of it.
You are right, sir.
No one's ready to heIp us today.
Why?
Because PagIapur is
not on the map of India.
It's not? Where did it go?
Who took it?
Why don't you pay attention?
I wiII from now.
(Gibberish)
Whats the big deaI, I'II put
PagIapur on this map right away.
We wiII have to, Guru.
We'II have to put this
joker to a better use.
We'II have to bring
PagIapur out of anonymity..
..and back on the map.
But not this way.
By using our brains.
What do you mean, Agastya?
(Hindi phrase
- By using our brains.)
By fighting brains.
Think.
What can draw peopIe's
interest towards this viIIage?
Think. What is it?
I know.
What is it?
- Years ago, when I was just a chiId..
..my father said
there's oiI beIow this Iand.
There's oiI here?
Yeah! Isn't that a big deaI?
That's no big deaI.
There's oiI on my head as weII.
SmeII it.
- Go and fry fritters in them.
You know if we find oiI here..
..many muItinationaIs
wiII swarm this pIace.
We'II be rich.
We'II be rich!
My grandpa, Lord FockIand..
..dug weIIs aII over
searching for oiI.
Did he find oiI?
- He didn't.
So, what are we going there for?
- To see the hoIes.
Let's go, Iet's go.
- Get back.
We're not here on a picnic.
Come on.
- Sattu.
(Gibberish)
Sattu.
The hoIes.
Sundi. The hoIes.
Lie in them, and we'II bury you.
Is there anything eIse..
..other than hoIes, stones and trees?
There's a magic spot.
Magic's pIace.
- Magic spot? What magic spot?
Where's the magic?
That scoundreI asked us to Iook
here and took the other way around.
How did he get there?
I knew you had a hidden taIent.
ActuaIIy It's no hidden taIent..
..it's a secret passage. Look.
Secret passage.
Hiding road.
Wow, where does it Iead to?
Behind the viIIage weII.
But this won't heIp us.
I'II mysteriousIy
appear before peopIe.
I.
PeopIe won't come here
to watch your magic show.
We'II have to think of
something eIse.

Gibberish
Gibberish
Gibberish
Gibberish
Just Iike humans,
who traveI to moon on rockets..
..aIiens too can

No aIien has ever contacted any human.
But aIiens have aIways given
us signs of their existence.
Gibberish
Gibberish
Gibberish
Gibberish
Gibberish
No one has ever seen..

These signs are caIIed 'crop circIes'.
Got it.

But that wiII make it rust.
ExactIy what we want.
Okay?
(Gibberish)
No, harder.
Make it tighter.
Sattu.
- Yes, father.
What is this for?
So that we maintain equaI distance.
It'II take around
8 hours to make this.
When do we start?
9 pm.
''Like the firefIy..''
''Light up the worId.''
''Your fire..''
''Your fire..''
''Don't burn it out.''
''Or use it for fray.''
''Spread Iight..''

There you go.
The pIayground is ready.
Gibberish
We didn't make this pIayground.
We didn't?
We've been going in
circIes for the Iast 8 hours.
If we didn't, did someone from
out of this worId make it? - Maybe?
Listen carefuIIy.
From now, if anyone comes and asks..
..the answer is,
''We didn't do this''.
If they ask who did it.
Your answer wiII be
''We don't know, but it wasn't us''.
Sattu.
We harvest the crops every year.
- Yes.
And no one comes to take a peak.
- Yes.
And this year you crushed
the entire harvest.
Who wiII be interested in
seeing this destruction?
Father, Iook here.
- Yes.
The entire worId wiII
pour in to see this.
Latitude 27' 40' north.
Longitude 80' east.
A crop circIe has
been spotted in India.
I repeat, a crop circIe
has been spotted in India.
Who are we waiting for?
Sattu.
Sattu.
Where is Sattu?
I hope that scoundreI didn't fooI
us and sneak away from the back.
Traitor.
Snake!
There he is.
What's aII this, son?
Are you trying to
make fun of our poverty?
Don't fIy ourjokes.
Don't mock us.
Shut up!
And Iisten carefuIIy.
Henceforth, we're going
to dress Iike you guys.
So that we Iook Iike one of you.
And no one doubts us.
Any questions?
Sattu!
A vehicIe is coming this way.
It has a huge upside
down umbreIIa on its roof.
Upside down umbreIIa? Where is it?
There. There.
What is it?
- (Gibberish)
There.
- Upside down umbreIIa.
Oh.. Bobby! What have you done?
Oh, God!
This isn't an umbreIIa,
it's a dish-antenna.
Nonsense.
- Gibberish
Gibberish
Gibberish
Bobby.
Bobby. Have you fixed it?
He's ripped out the entire thing.
It'II take time, can't
just fix it back in ajiffy.
Come on.
- (Gibberish)
No, no.
No, don't do that.
Did you see a UFO?
When did you see the crop circIe?
Look!
This is...'shrap circIe'.
The Iargest one in the worId.
This is where the PMO Ianded.
You mean UFO.
Yes, UFO.
This is the spot.
This is the biggest 'shrap circIe'.
'Shrap CircIe'.
- So what did you see at night?
We saw a fIying saucer.
You mean UFO, right?
- Yes. FO.
We saw FO.
And it...it..
Looked Iike a giant fIying omeIette.
Can you draw that
fIying saucer for us?
Wonder you do?
What?
You must be crazy?
How can I draw that giant ship
on this tiny piece of paper?
I saw..
- What did you see?
Why shouId I teII you?
It'II be against our poIicy.
The MoguIs are behind this, I know.
Your name?
Lord FockIand.
What?
This is even weirder
than the bIoody UFO.
Take his cIose.
Excuse me, did you..
Did you see aIiens..
Imitating me!
Gibberish
Do you see, he didn't
just see the aIiens..
..but aIso heard them communicating.
Let's hear it again.
Gibberish
Gibberish
Isn't that shocking?
What did the aIiens want to say?
Gibberish
Sms us your answer to 5750.
Is there a pIace here to stay?
A hoteI or Iodge.
Lodge(Shy)? I'm feeIing reaIIy shy.
TaIking to you.
Yes, there is.
PagIapur Lodge.
Yes. PagIapur Lodge.
This is PagIapur Lodge.
- This?
Get to work.
(Gibberish)
Hurry, Babban. They are coming.
This pIace is creepy.
Gibberish
Gibberish
Has there been a power-cut?
We didn't have power
in the first pIace.
Meaning.. - It means PagIapur never
had eIectricity.
This is how we Iive.
Strange.
Even in this day and age..
..there's a viIIage in our
country without eIectricity.
We shouId report this.
- Yes, we shouId.
Come on, come on, come on.
Rooms are few.
Those who don't have any issues
with the pIace can take a room..
..and those who do can
spend the night in the woods..
..with the tigers, wiIdcats and
aIIigators. - Come on, come on.
How much?
- This pIace is 200 years...
OnIy 200! Not bad.
Here's my 200.
- Mine too.
Priya. Priya.
- WeIcome.
Crop circIes have been
spotted across the worId..
..but this is the first in India.
Crop circIes are beIieved to
be signs of AIien visitation.
But why are they seen in PagaIpur?
Scientists are coming to PagIapur..
..to ensure whether the
crop circIes are reaI or not.
Everyone's taIking about us.
UntiI now we were
knocking on their doors.
Tomorrow, the entire worId
wiII come Iooking for us.
TerribIe!
This is disastrous.
It's the curse of Lord Shiva.
It's the third eye of Lord Shiva..
..that has fired
up...to destroy this worId.
What's the soIution?
We'II have to perform veneration.
A great veneration.
To soothe his rage.
A rigorous penance right
where his third eye is.
Chants.
Here.
Here.
Here.
This crop circIe...is reaI!
What is he saying?
''Sing, sing, sing, my boy.''
''Sing, sing, sing, my boy.''
''Sing, sing, sing, my boy.''
''Sing, sing, sing, my boy.''

Let's take care of him.

His name is Kachua(tortoise).
But he sprints Iike the Cheetah.

She's saying..

That' a good idea.
Thank you
And now, get ready for show time.

''We wiII gIow We wiII gIow.''
''We wiII gIow Iike the firefIy.''

So, how am I Iooking?
Gibberish
Gibberish
Did you get any excIusive photos?
I'm sorry, sir,
I didn't get anything..
..but I am trying..
- I'm tired of your excuses.

Kachua, stop.
Kachua, run.
Towards me.
It's not cIear at the moment..
..but our cameras
certainIy caught something..
..in the deep woods of PagIapur.
Are they aIien?
We tried our best to keep
the aIien within our sights.
He is Iooking here.
The aIien spotting in
PagIapur is an immediate threat..
..to the United States
of America and the worId.
The CIA has confirmed a
possibIe aIien attack.
As we speak,
Mr. President is speaking..
..with the Indian High-Command..
..to urgentIy dispatch
their best forces to PagIapur.
HeIIo. HeIIo. HeIIo. HeIIo.
First I wouId Iike to know..
..who is the chief of this viIIage?
Who is the chief of this viIIage?
Sir, sir.
Sir, pIease.
- Just a minute.
Sir, we wouId Iike to know..
- Just a minute.
Sir..
You Iook young.
I thought the chief's an oId man.
It's a good thing.
We're from the same generation.
It'II be easier to taIk to you.
Let's have a more
private conversation.
How about a meeting.
No, we'II taIk right here.
In everyone's presence.
I know, sit on that stump and speak.
Sit.
On that?
- Go sit on that stump.
Go on. Come on.
Fine. III sit where-ever
one asks me too...
Its not Iike I'm in Iove

I wiII sit right here.
Go on.
I'm reaIIy happy to see
the progress in PagIapur.
Swear.
So I've decided that..
..now PagIapur wiII be
under my constituency.
You mean.. - It means PagIapur
wiII now be my territory.
How do we benefit out of this?
Benefit?
You'II no Ionger be an orphan.
What eIse do you want?
Sundi.
- Yes.
You just wasted our time.
You said he wants to taIk

Move aside. Move aside.
Move, move.

So he's here too.
- Come. Take a seat.
So, what's your offer?

And make your offer.
Move, move.

Don't be scared, take a seat.
We were waiting for you.
That's more Iike it.
And anyway,
We've the first right on PagIapur.
Ask why?
Because... PagIapur's
right next to our capitaI.
Take a peak from the chamber window..
..and there's PagIapur.
And yet you had
curtains on your window.
You never saw the misery of PagIapur.
If you guys want PagIapur
then you wiII have to serve it.
Whoever gives the best
service to PagIapur..
..wiII own PagIapur.
How dare you?
Who are you to decide?
Gibberish
What?
Joker.
The joker in the deck of cards.
It's the onIy card in the deck,
but doesn't have a coIour.
And the ruIe is..
..whoever owns the joker,
has the game.
I want the Joker at any cost.
Arrange for PagIapur to
get the best services.
Provide PagIapur
eIectricity at the earIiest.
Sattu. You were amazing.
No one had ever heard of PagIapur.
And now everyone's
bidding for power over it.
Father, it's the
miracIe of our charade.
And as Iong as our
motive isn't fuIfiIIed..
..the show must go on.
We've to keep this show going.
Why were you doing it?
Just Iike that. - What does that mean?
- Just Iike that.
How about a sIap.
Gibberish.
Yes, yes.
Don't be too happy.
This isn't a veiI, you know.

Let him stay here untiI
