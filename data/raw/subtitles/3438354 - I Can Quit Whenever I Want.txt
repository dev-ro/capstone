In Italy to be defined as a drug
a substance has to be on the Ministry
of Health's illegal molecules list.
Cocaine, heroin, amphetamines,
methadone, ecstasy,
and more or less 200 other molecules
make up that list.
If a molecule isn't on that list,
then you can make it, take it,
but, above all, you can sell it.
I graduated in biology
at the age of 24 with top marks,
I have a master's in computational
neuroscience
and another in molecular dynamics.
In the last few months
I've set up a gang
that runs a business worth
hundreds of thousands of euros
I've been accused of producing
and pushing drugs, armed robbery,
kidnap and attempted homicide.
My name is Pietro Zinni,
and I'm a university researcher.
I CAN QUIT ANYTIME I WANT
4 MONTHS BEFORE
...with particular reference to
current molecular docking software,
often based on long
and, in our opinion,
unreliable phases of elaboration
of the Katchalski-Katzir algorithm.
Our aim instead is to obtain a result
that is much more immediate
and much more precise.
And that is why we are asking
- this commission to finance...
- Sorry, that's mine.
...further research.
Given the very delicate moment,
I have to keep it on.
Angelo, my man...
Yes.
These upgrades which I have taken
the liberty of naming Seta-Zinni,
have led to some surprising results.
We discovered, for example,
how the TAAR1 enzyme,
entering the vesicular transport
mechanism of the monoamines,
is able to achieve, as you can see in
this slide here, incredible results.
- From the point of view of...
- Damnation!
- There must be...
- Something's wrong!
There's a smell of burning as well!
Nothing here is legal,
the whole building is barely safe.
- Pietro, a little flexibility...
- No, it's stuck...
Finish up with the paper version,
I'm sure the professors have grasped
the importance of the research.
I'll go and get a lab technician.
- Francesco!
- I'll give out the paper version.
Oh, God, excuse me.
Professor, I'm sorry,
but the problem with the projector,
we need to be more careful
with certain things!
Pietro, this is serious,
this brownout
has messed up everything,
I can't even access my address book.
With all due respect, Professor,
We're talking about career here!
If they don't refinance my research,
I'm out of a job.
What? We're doing fine!
Now we need to find some political
protection, and I've already dealt with that.
I don't understand
this political thing at all...
The second from the left was
secretary to De Mita in the DC,
and I met him '86 at a monarchists'
convention in Avellino.
- I said you were one of ours.
- Our what?
- Communion and Liberation.
- Really, I'm not exactly...
And why the fuck should that matter Pietro?
What matters is that he smiled.
You know what that means?
A long-term contract.
I wish! I could really use
some financial stability.
Yes, but, as a scruple,
shall we try and reset the device?
Professor, I'm in a rush,
I'll do it tomorrow.
And I would have to spend all afternoon
with my cell phone not working?
If you have to go, go.
I'll ask your colleague Giacometti
and he'll do it.
What's Giacometti got to do with it?
I'll do it.
Where have you been?
It's nearly 4!
I had a problem with the professor...
Look at this, Pietro!
The situation's tragic.
- Are the kids here?
- They've been waiting for half an hour!
- What is it, the court?
- The elevator bill.
- It's an order to pay!
- That fucking elevator!
I don't want an elevator, I don't
want to pay for it, I don't use it!
Why did they send it to us? We have
a lawyer, my dear friend, Vittorio...
He's got a degree in canon law!
He's got a brain like this.
Vittorio was the ghost-writer
for the Pope's last encyclical.
- All right...
- And he's free.
- I need to do my lesson.
- Make sure you get paid!
If you don't ask them, I will!
Ssh! Keep it down, please!
I'll tell them.
Guys, sorry I'm late,
but I had a bit of a busy day.
You don't need to know...
Right, open your book at...
- Are you smoking a joint?
- While we were waiting...
While you were waiting?
Put that out right now!
Are you being serious?
She works with recovering addicts,
she'd see it as a provocation
and she'd be right!
- At least wait till she leaves!
- I'm going.
- Are you smoking a joint?
- No, someone's frying downstairs...
Make sure you get paid!
Yes, in fact...
I was thinking, in parallel with
the three-month course we're doing,
we could also maybe begin a discourse
about remuneration, let's say...
meaning...
when are you going to pay me?
Professor, we said before,
you have to meet us halfway.
I am meeting you halfway,
but you owe me more than 500 euros
each.
It's not personal,
I've not got it in for you,
it's a general thing
to do with all of you.
- Maurizio?
- He's lying down over there.
Over there, a moment, again?
He cannot be serious!
Does he think
this apartment is a hotel?
He comes here, does a lesson,
then lies down! I mean...
- Maurizio!
- Five minutes more, Prof, please...
No, no, no five minutes,
and I'd asked you to at least take
your jeans off when you get into bed.
Please! Close the door,
there's too much light coming in!
My head's bursting,
five minutes and I'll be with you.
No five minutes! Get up and come
for your lesson like everyone else.
Can you believe this?
- Where are you going?
- Time's up, I've got dance at 6.
- All right, and what did we agree?
- See you on Wednesday.
No, about the money.
Prof, there's a crisis, don't you
read the papers? Mark it down.
What...?
Hang on,
are you leaving Maurizio with me?
I spoke with Vittorio and I have
to say he really reassured me,
because he says the order to pay
isn't like a definitive sentence.
So we can oppose it
and gain some time.
It's only a matter of days, love,
I'll get my contract and we can...
Maurizio, I think you should go
for a thorough general checkup,
because the way you fall asleep,
it could be first-stage narcolepsy.
- It's serious, you know.
- I don't think so...
because I got home at 6 this morning,
exhausted. That must be it.
I understand, but don't your parents
say anything?
About paying for the lessons too...
Giulia, Maurizio lost his parents
in a plane crash,
so you can imagine
how serious the situation is,
the poor guy has to serve tables at
the weekend to pay for his lessons,
tell her.
I have to serve tables
at the weekend.
But he's planning to pay... Tell her.
I'm planning to pay.
Anyway,
what I was trying to say earlier
was the research
really was a great success.
The commission saw right away
the revolutionary impact
of this algorithm
that I invented and that will lead,
I'm sure, to a scientific earthquake.
Prof, not at the table!
This agony has been going on
in the background all afternoon,
the contract, the scientific
research, the earthquake, eh!
Yes, really, Pietro, with all
the problems we have, you as well!
So,
according to Schrodinger's equation,
we can say without any doubt
that the particles...
- Pietro, I have to speak to you.
- Professor, I'm doing an exam...
I know what this student's like.
You're not ready, obviously,
come back next session.
Professor, I've answered
all the questions, I need this exam.
My family has a pharmacy!
What can I tell my father?
28 out of 30, to stop you breaking
my balls! All right?
- What is it?
- I've two bits of news for you,
one is bad
and the other is really shit,
because the commission has agreed
to only one of the five requests
for financing
because of the cutbacks.
This is a tragedy, especially
for my colleagues, because...
No, you don't get it, the really shit
news is Giacometti got it.
Giacometti got it?
But my research could be
Nobel material! Giacometti?
Listen, Pietro,
they understood nothing about your
research because it's too difficult!
I didn't understand anything about it
either!
Professor Seta looked like a fool,
because they were asking and asking
and asking things I couldn't answer.
Professor,
we both signed the research!
You can't not answer the questions,
please!
You don't understand!
It's a political problem.
Your decision to line up
with the Catholic extremists
was a mistake and very shortsighted.
Professor, it was you who said your
friend from Avellino had smiled...
- It was nothing to do with me.
- He's an old Trotskyite
from the Communist Party
who's in Sinistra e Libert√† now!
I even tried speaking to him,
I said, we have some Catholic values
in common,
you know what he said? Fuck off!
So I said, if you say fuck off,
Then why don't you fuck off, you old bugger!
And then things got a bit out of control.
Professor, does this mean
no long-term contract?
They won't even give you
a year's contract!
Those 500 euros a month kept me going
Professor!
I'm 37, what can I start doing now?
Wait, I need to answer this.
Yes, hello, Marchetto!
What can I say?
We proceed into the unknown...
I wanted to ask you, did you book
the mooring for the boat?
Angioletto really messed things up.
Do you know what the dickhead did?
- Pietro, you in the bathroom?
- Yes.
- You going to be long?
- No, I'm finished. Coming.
- You sound strange.
- No, no.
- Have you been crying?
- No, no,
it's the PH of this soap of yours,
I think...
Pietro, don't be an asshole,
has something happened at work?
No, no...
I wanted to talk to you for a minute...
Are there problems
with your contract?
No. It's just that the new contract
has kind of...
Did they give you a new contract
or not?
If you want a simple yes or no...
- Yes or no?
- Yes!
Yes, and a full-time contract.
I wanted to surprise you,
but you spoiled it. But so what?
Did they tell you
what they'll pay you a month?
Well, that's not something you ask...
No, of course,
don't worry about it...
Don't expect too much,
it's not like they made me rector.
All right, I get it, but at least
1,500, no? For fuck's sake!
Sure, maybe a little bit more.
- 2,000?
- Sure.
Hang on, 1,500 or 2,000?
Do a weighted mean, kind of 1,800.
All right,
this way we can pay the elevator.
Yeah, sure.
- Then we'll hire a real lawyer.
- Sure.
And while we're at it, a dishwasher.
Yeah, but let's not make
That classic mistake people make,
where as soon as they get some money,
- they spend it.
- Sure. Let's go through there.
Through there? It's 9,
I've got to meet Giorgio and Mattia.
So go later!
No, this drop in adrenaline
has lowered my potassium...
You can make a banana shake after.
Then I'll go in asthenia,
major saline deficiency...
- Pietro, you're breaking my balls!
- I'm coming.
But, hands up, don't expect too much
of a performance
which is going to be purely
celebratory, no fancy acrobatics!
What can I tell you?
From what you say,
it sounds really complicated.
I'd almost say a Hellerian paradox.
Giorgio, I'm jobless, penniless
and you say it's Hellerian?
- It's a tragedy!
- Look,
in itself it doesn't have
too high a gravity index.
It's the lying which complicates it,
given your domestic situation.
I know, Mattia,
but after seven years of sacrifices,
- how could I tell her the truth?
- Yes?
- Fill her up.
- Why mention a long-term contract?
Well, that bullshit just slipped out.
Guys, I have a court order to pay,
they're going to seize my things,
and it's all really stressful
at home...
I know, but moaning won't help.
Guys, this is pathetic!
I mean, look at yourselves!
I don't want to end up like you!
Internationally acclaimed Latin scholars
standing in a gas station
working for a Singhalese guy
who pays you cash.
Pietro, watch what you say
about Mister Ali Khan,
who had faith in us
at a very difficult moment.
He's a lovely man, of undoubted
morality and generosity...
Oi! Do I pay you to stand there
and chat?
Sorry, Mr. Ali Khan.
The gentleman is leaving.
Go, or he'll be pissed
and rightly so.
You speak Singhalese?
Well, if you know Sanskrit,
it all falls into place.
- 205 euros.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Good night.
- Was that Maurizio?
- Who?
- What did he just pay?
- 205 euros.
Two...
The helmet, Mattia, the helmet!
Maurizio!
Maurizio!
Fucking hell
Professor! What are you doing...?
- Out on a bike at this hour?
- Maurizio,
pull over right now
because you and I have to speak!
What's going on? I've been telling
everyone you're poor
and you're driving around
in a spaceship?
- I thought you were a waiter?
- Yeah, I don't do it very often.
My father's got a catering company.
Your father?
I thought your father was dead!
No! We argued and I said, "As far
as I'm concerned, you're dead."
- But then we made up...
- OK, but there's a big difference!
Maurizio, pull over now
and give me what you owe me, because
I saw you pay 200 euros for gas,
- I saw you!
- I can't, I'll miss the guest list.
- What?
- At Central, it closes at one.
It's late, I need to go.
- Great, Professor! On you go!
- Maurizio!
Come here! Maurizio!
Maurizio!
- Maurizio!
- Great, Professor! Here as well!
That helmet suits you!
What style!
Get down here, we need to speak!
Get down!
Professor, what a fuss
over some loose change.
I'll give you it now
just to keep you happy.
- How much is it?
- 500 euros.
Plus 30 euros to get in here,
which has to be added.
I can't, I have to pay for my table.
- I can give you half.
- No! Not half, give me all of it.
All right, I'll give you all of it
on Wednesday. Great, Professor!
All right. Give me half. Give me half
and the rest on Wednesday.
And let me tell you, you're
a profoundly dishonest person,
you're rude, and you're a big liar!
You want to ruin my night?
Relax a minute,
you're a mess, you're all sweaty.
I'm sweaty! This place is hellish,
with a 40 degrees temperature range,
- and I am really, really jumpy.
- Exactly, so drink this.
- What is it?
- What is it? It's a cocktail!
All right,
just because I'm really thirsty.
It's on me. It costs 100 euros.
It'll get rid of all your worries,
all your concerns,
it's on me.
It's quite light
and it's a bit fruity...
- Sorry, why does it cost 100 euros?
- Yeah, Professor!
I'm sorry, what are you doing?
I'm peeing!
Go outside if you want to collapse.
- Maurizio!
- Great, Professor! Where were you?
- What was that? Did you drug me?
- Have another one to pick you up!
Maurizio, you're dangerous!
You could have killed me!
Kill you! That's top-quality stuff.
Quality? It's synthetic rubbish,
some ephedrine concoction!
That rubbish contained two pills
that cost 50 euros each!
Maurizio, I'm a nice guy,
but if I lose it... 50 euros?
That's fraud! Making one of those
can't cost more than two euros.
Well, next lesson, teach us how
to make it and we'll make a kilo!
Great, Professor!
DISCO PILLS
CONSEQUENCES OF SELLING DRUGS
SELLING DRUGS LEGALLY
SPREAD OF LEGAL SMART DRUGS THAT HAVE
THE SAME EFFECTS AS TRADITIONAL DRUGS
THE POLICE CAN'T DO ANYTHING,
THEY CAN'T ARREST US
- ONE'S ILLEGAL, ONE'S NOT
- IT'S A LEGISLATIVE GAP IN EUROPE
ALL THE E.U. CAN DO IS CONSTANTLY
UPDATE THE LIST OF NEW SUBSTANCES
- Pietro?
- Yeah.
You're still up?
What are you doing?
I was just surfing a bit...
randomly.
Make sure you delete the history
at least.
- What's that on your face?
- Eh?
- On your face.
- Oh no nothing it's just a dick.
Why have you got a dick
drawn on your face?
Because it seemed like a fun thing
to do. No?
Ah, it's you? Pietro, quick,
I've only got a five-minute break.
No, it's that I've almost finished
my research.
The study on the algorithm?
You set out again
from the tertiary structure
of the TAAR1
to get a better score function
for its endogenous agonists.
Bloody hell, well done.
Good work, but why bring it to me?
No, well, because you were there at
the start 5 years ago, I thought...
Now I'm doing something else.
Listen, Alberto, if I said to you
C11 H15 N O2, what would you say?
5 minutes' break means 300 seconds
and I need to pee.
- It won't take long. C11 H15 N O2.
- Did Professor Seta send you?
Tell him I won't put my name
to anything! Never again!
It's nothing to do with Seta.
C11 H15 N O2.
All right, it's a psychotropic
that acts on the serotonergic system.
- And?
- And? What? And it's illegal!
What if I make it legal for you?
Alberto, Alberto, wait!
Yes, yes. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Really... I don't understand you.
No, Pietro! You can't be in here.
I'm not interested, I told you...
Alberto, Alberto,
they refused to fund my research.
I'd almost finished,
the algorithm was working.
But why have a theoretical molecule
program if you can't use it?
Sure! So you thought,
I'll theorize a psychotropic one!
Alberto, we're more intelligent
than the others.
If we worked together
we could made a pile of money!
Pietro, maximum six months
I'll be working as a waiter here.
Tips, one day off a week and 700
euros a month! Do you get it?
I'll help you earn 700 euros
in half an hour.
While you're washing the plates,
think about it. I'll be outside.
I'm washing them, I'm washing them!
Fuck off!
Look, I'll spare you all the lectures
on the ethical level,
because I abandoned ethics when
they kicked me out of university.
I'm being practical.
I don't want to go to jail!
Alberto, criminals go to jail,
are you and I criminals?
With the algorithm I make a molecule
that's not on the Ministry list,
and you produce it.
Together we make the best substance
ever and we do it all legally.
Why would I do something like that?
Because you're a university professor
and you don't deserve this life.
- What's that on your face?
- What's left of a dick.
These indelible pens that...
All right, let's not get distracted.
Listen, we're going to form a gang.
- A gang?
- A gang.
Of pushers? We can't,
we wouldn't be credible, no!
No, we're not credible.
But we could become credible
and I've got the right person...
...So I did two years' prison
so as not to grass a friend.
I got out, went to work with my uncle
until he died three months ago...
- Ah, I'm sorry.
- No, he didn't suffer,
they knifed him really accurately,
here on the carotid.
And the guy that did it was right,
some old online poker business.
That's when it got messy,
his children fighting over the will,
a bitter legal quarrel over the
inheritance, families are like that.
- An argument about money.
- Sorry, what did you say?
The children started fighting,
it always happens with money.
- You said "bitter legal quarrel".
- Me? I don't know what that means.
- You're a graduate.
- I'm not a graduate.
I was clear. I don't take graduates.
I'm not! I got kicked out
of middle school for selling dope.
- You can't be trusted.
- Why would I be here, then?
- You're the third this week.
- I'm not a graduate!
All right, I am, but it was
a youthful mistake that I regret.
I'm asking to renounce
my academic qualifications.
In two weeks,
I'll be back to grade 5 level.
I can show you all the paperwork.
- You get your hands dirty here.
- That's why I'm here.
I don't need people who are always
reading. Is that clear?
- You can see you're a good kid.
- No! Don't call me a good kid!
I'm really very dangerous,
from one moment to another
I might do something unexpected...
Yes. Well?
Andrea de Santis, anthropologist.
He was a big shot
at Sapienza University.
That was an important bill,
wasn't it? I'm really sorry,
I don't know what came over me.
It was a bill,
but the important thing
is the number, you can trace it...
Send me the PDF and I'll reprint it.
I'm very sorry.
What are you doing? You can see
you're not cut out for it.
I know. But I'm going through
a difficult period.
Listen, kid, get a bit of experience,
get into trouble, live on the street,
and then maybe come back.
Yes, thanks for the advice.
Before the cuts in 2007,
Andrea was one of Italy's leading
experts in cultural anthropology.
His works on the holistic study
of humanity
have been translated
into 50 languages.
Andrea will transform us.
There's no human category he doesn't
know and can't emulate in some way.
He'll fit us
into the world of crime.
What will we do about sales?
We need someone who's good at night.
I've got two guys,
they've been night people for years.
They know their way round the street
as well,
I mean, people who have seen it all,
eh! Trust me.
- Yes?
- Can you check my tires?
Check my tires... Despite the racket,
I've always found it fascinating
when the Anglo-Saxon contaminates
the vernacular.
What the fuck are you saying?
Obviously, this occurs
in barely literate environments...
I'm going to crack his skull.
Mattia, Mattia, the brawny gentleman
seems to me to be hostile.
I'd like to remind you that even
the threat of violence is a crime...
Oh, fuck off, you!
Then there's Arturo Frantini.
Whenever they find something from
Ancient Rome, he comes to supervise.
He's a classics archeology graduate
specialized in archeological mapping.
Nobody knows Rome like he does.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
switch this thing off, please!
It's a memorial plaque
to Theodosius the Great.
You can't use a pneumatic drill
on it!
Sorry, sir, I got caught up...
He's poor, 11 years of short-term
contracts, lives with his parents.
- Sir, you not eating?
- No, no.
It's too hot
and I'm scared of putting on weight.
When I was a teenager they thought
I might have celiac disease,
- and until the doctors decide...
- All right, I get it.
No, really, really, I'm fine.
This is the one with omelet.
Your wife makes it with onion?
Well, not to be rude to her,
maybe I can make an exception.
Why do we need an archeologist?
We need Arturo for the truck.
The truck?
Arturo has the use of a vehicle
from the Archeology Department.
Total access to all parts of town,
diamond lanes, downtown,
even the bypass at night.
The police won't stop
an Archeology Department truck.
Of course.
What about all the financial part?
I was thinking of Martinetti.
Management economics.
- Martinetti's in Norway.
- He got the teaching post in Oslo?
No, he's on the fishing boats,
six months in the Arctic Circle,
the whole cod season.
Good!
There's Bonelli.
Why not, dynamic microeconomics, no?
- No, Bonelli's a loose cannon.
- Long ago! He's better now.
He's doing important economic-math
research and it's going pretty well.
- 2,000.
- I'll see you.
Me too.
Now, guys, this is all just math,
so don't complain.
- Two pairs.
- Three of a kind.
- Straight flush.
- Three of a kind?
2,000 with two aces,
what kind of bluff is that?
What bluff? This is math.
There are 52 cards?
So there are 52 factorial divisions.
divided by 52,
minus factorial 5, divided by
factorial 5, which makes 2,698,590,
all right. I understand your flush,
but the three of a kind is strange.
Bartolomeo, if this is an excuse
not to pay, be careful.
Of course not.
But if I say the three of a kind
is strange, it's because it is.
What the fuck are you saying?
Excuse me,
do you do inferential statistics?
Random variables?
Calculating probability?
I don't really think so.
- Anyway, what's the total?
- 7,000.
7,000. I'll pay it all.
Though I still have my doubts...
But let me say this: let's play
one more hand, winner takes all?
Bartolomeo, pay up
before the evening turns sour!
You could just say no.
I haven't got cash,
I'll give you a post-dated check.
- Cash is better.
- Cash is better, yes.
Oh, you're overdoing it!
Bartolomeo!
Give us the money!
- Baby, what have you done now?
- Don't be angry with me.
Your father, with all due respect,
has no sense of irony! Fuck!
We were just playing cards... And
at certain point, he went mad, mad...
Pietro,
what the fuck are you doing here?
- Get in.
- Yeah.
How can I tell you this?
You can't count the cards in poker.
It's people like you I screw.
- Hello, Professor Frantini.
- Professor Bonelli.
Ok we should go now, because if they get
the Porsches we'll be in the shit.
- Undoubtedly.
- Yes.
First of all,
I'd like to thank Giorgio and Mattia
for letting us use this place...
Bloody hell, guys!
You bought a gas station?
No, it belongs to Mister Ali Khan,
he uses the warehouses
for his workers...
Ah, this is very interesting, because
I've just been living with a girl
from a Sinti circus family...
a difficult relationship,
because they're very traditional,
really attached to money...
Stop there, if you're thinking
of moving in here,
I have to stop you because you can't.
- "I have to stop you"!
- You can't smoke here.
- It's all inflammable.
- Mattia! - Absolutely forbidden.
All right, maybe we can sort out
the lodgings problem later.
You'll be wondering why I asked you
all to come here.
I know what you're up to.
But really, Pietro,
another demo by researchers
on short-term contracts
outside Parliament,
- after the last beating we got...
- No, Arturo.
I didn't ask you here for yet another
demo against research cuts.
I asked you here precisely because
I don't want to do that again.
You're the greatest minds around
and you're living
on the fringes of society!
The only thing we know how to do
is study. And they won't let us.
Well, I've worked out a way
to get what we deserve.
- Back to the demo again!
- No, Arturo,
We form a gang.
We put a new drug on the market,
not the shit they have in clubs now,
but the best product
there's ever been!
What do you think?
Excuse me, are you saying
that if I for two, two, nights,
with a mattress this size went behind
that pillar someone would notice?
Bartolomeo, come on, we're making
an important decision here.
I'm with you 100%, this setting up
for ourselves really appeals to me.
You all know my training was all
based on early Austrian liberalism,
Von Hayek e Von Mises...
There's the tank!
Who'd see me behind the tank?
- Come on, guys.
- Excuse me, Pietro...
just to check I've understood.
You want to set up a gang of pushers
like in the American TV shows?
I'm not sure this initiative is
entirely in line with the penal code.
Yes, it is,
because I've theorized a molecule
that for Italian law is legal.
Never mind this silly legal stuff
for now. Let's go step by step.
Phase 1. Start-up. Bartolomeo,
I need a detailed financial plan,
I have to understand
if this is economically sustainable.
Costs, income, profit margins,
everything.
To start with, we'll begin
with a simple Cartesian model...
...within a math system that,
to keep things simple,
we'll call "the market".
Having established
the supply and demand curves,
we have the basis
on which to get start-up funds.
Don't make those faces because
there's nothing to worry about.
The issuing of shares takes the time
it takes, we know that,
but there's the liquidation
and/or cashing in of stock options,
we have credit lines, we have
the possibility of pre-billing,
we can get a loan, an advance
on our severance packages...
...remortgaging...
...some personal savings...
loans from your families...
nothing.
All right,
I'll come up with something.
Fuck!
- Are you mad?
- It's me.
- What are you doing?
- I needed to see you.
- What, you need money?
- No, no! Well, a little.
- Help!
- Shhh! Are you mad? Shut up!
Get out of here, Bartolomeo.
I'm giving you nothing!
You'd only lose it.
You can't count the cards in poker.
Apart from the fact you can,
and it's not just me who says so,
but that's irrelevant now.
It's for a project with my university
colleagues, it's something concrete.
You always say that. I know you're
only interested in me for my money.
That's not true!
That's hurtful to me!
I'm building something with you,
looking ahead.
So marry me!
God, you're beautiful tonight.
- You'll really marry me?
- We'll see, listen...
10,000 euros in cash,
but small denomination notes,
not those 500-euro ones,
people don't like them.
Phase 2. Raw materials. Eugenol, you
find it in anything made with cloves.
We need a lot. Shampoo,
air fresheners, essential oils.
We'll extract it.
Ah, you make your own? Good to know.
I can tell my wife now,
she's obsessed with cloves.
I'll get some supplies in,
I'll take 50.
Eugenol treated with potassium
hydroxide and amyl alcohol
becomes isoeugenol.
To transform it into MD2P
we need sodium perborate.
We'll extract that
from the integrators for aquariums.
I've got a huge aquarium.
Then we need lots of distilled water,
and icing sugar as an excipient.
Phase 3. Production.
Using reductive amination,
the MD2P and alanine
will provide us with our smart drug.
The point of no return,
we're all involved from here on.
All right, Pietro, I'm sorry.
As far as I'm concerned, it's over.
Say goodbye to the others.
- What is it now, Alberto?
- You're asking me what it is?
You're suggesting sodium borohydride
for reductive amination,
which is something so amateur
any street junkie could do it...
- It's not that amateur.
- Pietro, let's be honest.
If you'd said let's make a drug with
sodium borohydride, I'd have said no.
- Sssh, the Chinese.
- Do we want to make a good drug,
synthesizing psychotropic substances
of a certain level?
We can't go below
a certain purity level!
Otherwise it'll look bad
and I won't have that!
All right! All right, come on!
We'll use hydrogen and rhodium.
- Happy?
- Yes! Yes!
But, Alberto, what a pain!
We'll use the university lab.
We'll need a few hours, we'll go in
on Friday night, when it's empty.
- It's only one gate, climb it backwards.
- That's not helping.
All right. Don't panic.
Take the handle,
then an anticlockwise movement
for 180 degrees and come towards me.
I should go back down
and start again.
We've been here half an hour. Hurry
up, the security camera will see us.
- Left?
- Left, go. It's easy, go.
Alberto! You said you were solid
but agile, you're an armchair!
- Give me your hand.
- My hand? - Yes, give me it.
- I'm trusting you.
- Give me your hand. Come.
- I'll let go.
- What? Who could hold you?
Go down and come back up.
It's the only...
Alberto!
- I really missed this place.
- Yeah, come on.
99% pure, apart from the excipients!
You'll forgive me
if I'm a few zeroes out.
To see certain levels of purity,
you need HPLC.
Yes, Alberto! In two hours
this place will be full of people!
We have to get a move on.
Yes, but this is the zero number,
this is not for sale.
No, I'll take this one
and put it in my wallet, OK?
- All right.
- So don't worry, but hurry up!
Listen, are we going to do
the whole testing phase?
- Yes, of course we will.
- We will?
You call this scientific testing?
Of course! But instead of doing it
in the lab, we do it right here!
How can we collect empirical evidence
in this chaos?
It's not a suitable environment,
it's hostile even.
And these guys
have never been in a club.
That's why we got an anthropologist.
Right, for the last time. In a club,
body language is fundamental.
If your arms are pointing to
the exit... Straighten your feet!
It means we feel guilty and can't
wait to go. That's no good!
The raised chain is synonymous
with self-assurance,
and is anthropologically perfect
to attract everyone in here
who wants to have a night off
from ordinary morals.
So raised chin,
never looking in that direction.
Start with a little self-marketing
to introduce ourselves.
Great!
Until it's them who come to us.
You got something for me?
It's not enough for them to want it,
they have to desire it.
- Go for a walk!
- Don't worry, I've got money!
Go and check the restroom.
- The restroom?
- The restroom, go.
In the restroom,
relationships change,
people become more complicit
even with strangers.
The toilet area discriminates
on a gender basis,
males there, females there,
and so sexual tensions
are smoothed out.
- I was told to come here for...
- 200 euros.
- 200 euros, what the hell is it?
- A bomb, thank you.
- What did I tell you?
- Can I see it, at least?
Money first.
Here! But if you rip me off...
- Knock at the last door. Trust me.
- All right.
- What a system! Well done. Bye.
- Bye, handsome.
Look. What did I tell you?
Excuse me.
Hello.
I'm part of the psychotropic
sales team in the restroom.
- I wanted to ask what you thought.
- This stuff is spectacular.
Could you be more specific?
When I went to knock on the restroom
door, I saw the system is perfect.
- Well done, Murena.
- Who?
Murena. The guy with the best stuff.
Do you not work for Murena?
I don't know Murena.
I work for Pietro.
If you were to grade
your satisfaction on a scale of...
Is that your woman there?
No, she's not.
Can you concentrate a moment?
Well, I think I'll try my luck.
Excuse me!
One moment, a question!
40 minutes, guys,
we finished it in 40 minutes!
Amazing! It's not enough to adjust
the price, we have to make more.
All right, but I'd like to bring up
the division of labor.
I found it discriminatory,
claustrophobic
and above all unhygienic:
I was two hours
sitting above the toilet bowl,
passing bags under the door!
Giorgio, your role is fundamental,
you see?
The WC is the estrema ratio.
If the police come,
you chuck it in the bowl, flush it
away, and we're home free!
But did we not say
all this was legal?
For the hundredth time, what we're
selling in itself is not illegal,
but we're selling something
that is ingested without any license,
and without receipts,
so it's tax avoidance!
And, Alberto, leave the customers
in peace.
They like it? That means it's good.
ONCE SOAKED THE BARK IS PLACED
ON THE FIRE TO MAKE IT WARM AND SOFT
Listen, I was thinking,
let's get the dishwasher.
You said not to be too greedy.
Yeah, but it's something useful.
Let's be greedy.
But get a cool one.
- Where are you going?
- To see Giorgio and Mattia.
Again!
That's the third time this week!
And it might be the last.
They're at risk of being fired!
I go there, chat,
try to cheer them up a bit.
It really helps them. In fact
they said, "It really helps us."
Is that a new jacket? Is it silk?
No, it's an acrylic mix.
Really makes me sweat.
- Will I wait up for you?
- No, love, sleep, I'll be late.
I really don't want to go!
And then we have Bohemian Rhapsody.
An exceptional dog,
it seeks, hunts, retrieves.
- What exactly are you looking for?
- We'll take it.
Here we are. This is South Rome
and Torrino. Look at that.
- Hang on, Andrea, what's this?
- Five euros.
We don't take small notes!
We can't be here all night counting!
A bit of flexibility.
If they have small change,
they're not our clientele.
Guys, we're about to go somewhere
anthropologically delicate!
It won't take much to set things
off! Don't make me look bad.
If anyone's interested,
this is Palazzo della Cancelleria.
Not everyone knows
it contains the Titulus Damasi,
- commonly known as San Lorenzo.
- Enough! Enough!
- These pants are haemostatic!
- The distichous is beautiful,
- dedicated to Damasus...
- I can't get them off!
Haec damasus tibi christe deus,
all right, you don't care, I know.
My boyfriend is a Scorpio,
very strong dominating character,
Scorpio ascendant, a big Scorpio,
really Scorpio!
Just as well as we didn't have
to overdo it! Listen!
- You need some stuff?
- Yeah, that would make my night.
- 900.
- 900.
I mean it, guys, exactly the same
lifestyle as before, understood?
Hi. As you can see,
I'm a homosexual like you.
I wanted to ask about
that substance you just took,
but don't worry, it's anonymous, it's
research... What are you doing?
Yes, thank you.
No, I wanted to ask you,
for example, that sexual impulse
towards me you cannot control,
does that depend on what you took?
Or is it just you like me?
All right, it doesn't matter.
Come on, stop it! No!
- Pietro.
- What the fuck is this?
- The dishwasher.
- I know, but...
- Have you just got home?
- No, I was just...
- I was going to university.
- Are those leather pants?
Who? No... they're really comfy
and I got them in the sales.
You're going to work at 6
in the morning?
The professor asked me for a favor,
because we're like this, Giulia.
Have you had breakfast at least?
I mean, though, Pietro, let me say,
you're acting a bit strange.
Look at the way you're dressed,
you look like Jim Morrison.
And then this thing about going to
see Giorgio and Mattia every night.
I know you feel guilty
they're pumping gas
and you've got a long-term contract
at university...
- Pietro! Are you listening?
- Pumping gas...
No, I was listening, Giulia.
But we always talk
about the same things.
Giorgio, Mattia, university...
It's normal
for someone to fall asleep.
You never talk to me about you,
how you are. There, how are you?
Work's a real disaster.
There's been a big rise in people
taking drugs again.
There are these new pills
going round...
...so many people have started using again.
And it seems this thing's
not officially illegal.
So they can't do anything for now.
These people are so unscrupulous,
I'd lock them up without even
a trial, life in jail, these shits!
Well, "shits" seems
a bit over the top,
maybe they've had problems, and it's
too easy to demand a clampdown.
Pietro, what the fuck are you saying?
They put one of the best drugs in
years out there and you defend them?
No... but who said that,
that these pills are cool?
The people that have tried them!
Who else?
What did they say? Are they, like,
normal cool or really cool, cool?
- Are you insane?
- No, it was just to have a chat.
You say we never talk.
Are you not hungry? You not like
it? You want something else?
Sir, it says here
this is 50 euros a plate!
I told you. They increased
our allowances... I'll get it.
Think about a second course,
there's three pages of fish alone.
If you say so, sir.
I deal stuff of a certain level
for people of a certain level.
The parties I organize, Happiness,
are to entertain people,
- so they remember and are grateful.
- Of course.
We're talking 20,000 a night plus.
In Rome I've always used this Murena.
I don't know if you know him.
Yes, I've heard something
about this Murena.
But I can guarantee we have the best
product on the market at the moment.
All right, you take my nice business
card, put it in your pocket,
send me a neutral text message and
we'll meet to discuss the details.
This is the lounge and with its
150 square meters it's a real jewel.
As you can see, the terrace offers
an unrivalled view of downtown Rome,
while the upper terrace has a heated
pool, sauna and a small gym.
How long were you thinking
of staying?
We were thinking
more of an open-ended thing.
- Is this a bearing pillar?
- Pardon?
To knock it down maybe,
it's all a bit claustrophobic.
This is a hotel,
you can't rebuild it.
It's just we come from
a post-industrial modern open space.
But anyway we'll take it.
On you go, Alberto, go on.
It's just a scientific experiment.
You've done lots, haven't you?
Be brave, be brave, be brave.
You're breaking our balls here too?
Fuck off! What do you want?
- He answers back as well!
- Buddy, Murena's in charge here.
"Buddy, Murena's in charge here."
You watch too many American movies...
Fuck, Christ, you've broken my nose!
Are you mad?
Pushing a bit out at Torrino was OK,
we let you do that,
but now you're pissing us off.
Next time we see you,
we'll shoot you. Understand?
- There was no need for that.
- This is Murena's patch, OK?
No, guys, you're really obsessed
with these American movies...
- Who was it, Bartolomeo?
- Murena. Murena's men.
Fucking Murena! Fucking Murena!
I keep hearing his name,
Murena, you've broken my balls!
- These are real bad guys.
- You don't understand, Bartolomeo.
- We're the bad guys now.
- We need to screw them!
We'll get some cold weapons
and smash their faces in!
What have you done?
You didn't let me test them,
so I said to myself, try it.
Drink some water and stay hydrated.
- Pietro, what will we do?
- I'm telling you, we have to screw them up.
This stuff's sticky, we need to sort
out the dryness. Take a note.
Guys,
we need to really change mentality.
We can't keep going to squats,
dressed like fools, for loose change.
We have to go up a level.
- Have you got a tux?
- Yes! No, it doesn't fit!
Take a note! Adjust tux.
Hey! Great! You don't know
how happy I am that you're here.
- Thank you for inviting us.
- Let's enjoy the evening now.
Simon, will you deal with the giving
and getting? I'll introduce you.
Hello... I'm Alberto.
Paprika.
Paprika. Unusual.
Excuse me a moment. I'll be right
back. Don't you go anywhere.
Forget it, really. Panamanian SIM
card in a third party's name.
They'll be on to you, and I was
looking at nine years for conspiracy.
No, these days not to have any
worries, write it down, Palabras!
- Palabras?
- Second company in Bolivia. Great.
- In the sense it's secure?
- Secure?
If the judge manages to tap this,
what can I say?
You're good, really good. I'll hand
myself in. But he won't tap it.
Since I got one, everyone's got one.
- Excuse me.
- On you go.
Love! No, we're with the ministers.
They want the decree for tomorrow.
- Pietro!
- Professor.
It's good to see you! What are you
doing here? You vanished!
I'm doing all I can
to get you back in!
I even went to see an old friend
from school, a guy with contacts.
Professor, thank you, but I'm not
interested, I've changed fields.
You did well, you can't earn
a fucking thing at university.
Excuse me, but you were speaking
with Undersecretary Pallazzo.
Yes, I was introduced...
He and I have our boats
at the same pier,
but I've never been bold enough
to approach him.
But if you could maybe have a word
with him about me,
get me a seat on the board of the NRC
at least.
- I don't know, Professor...
- To represent civil society.
- I'm sorry, I really have to go.
- Hang on.
Take my card. I had to change numbers,
the Salerno D.A. was hassling me.
- Thank you.
- Don't worry about the +591,
it's a Bolivian number, it's a long
story, I'll tell you later.
Rallying gives you a rush
that no other sport does.
- But then there are side effects!
- So you're at a certain level?
I was placed in the last Africa Eco
Race despite an asshole navigator.
And on the dunes, if you don't have
a good navigator, you're screwed!
I've been looking for you
for half an hour.
- Can you give me some stuff?
- What for?
The tests. I'll send you the file.
Give!
Alberto, you know regular ingestion
can lead to addiction.
Don't break my balls!
Give me the pills!
Behave!
- Come on!
- Wait!
But that's not me!
Why would I lie?
Stop it, I know it's you!
In fact, I know that guy there
is one of your gang too.
What gang? There's no gang. Someone
like him in a gang? No way...
- I know all of you, I know!
- It's nothing to do with me.
I don't understand though
in what sense...
Ah, you mean literally?
Of course, if you put it like that...
It's me.
But...
- Alberto, what are you doing here?
- Having breakfast.
I had a bit of a night.
Alberto, do you think these two
are escorts?
I tried to bring that up,
but she only answered in Russian,
but no, I don't think so.
Alberto, they're escorts.
You think girls like that would go
with the likes of us?
Speak for yourself!
I've had better-looking girls.
- Who?
- Veronica, doctorate, second year.
I think we'll need to give them
1,000 euros.
Just out of politeness.
- Where were you? It's 2pm!
- At university.
- You stink of alcohol!
- We're using ethanol and so...
- You go to work in a tux?
- Come on, Giulia, please,
it was a stag night for a colleague
and we all dressed up in tuxes...
A stag night? Whose?
What colleague?
You know...
Gian... luca... Ciarra...
vanellini.
Doctor Gianluca Ciarravanellini.
Do you think I'm stupid? How the
fuck did we buy all these things?
The 3D TV, the dishwasher, all these
fucking jackets, you've got 300 of them!
Giulia, calm down. I told you,
it's a grant from 2008...
I went to the university. They say
they haven't seen you for months!
As for the long term-contract...
One, don't lift your hands to me.
Two, keep your nose out my business.
Three, I was going to tell you,
I've got a new job.
Yeah? A well-paid one
by the look of things!
- Where did you get this?
- Where you hid it!
Where the fuck is this money from?
It's something I'm doing with Giorgio
and Mattia, an investment...
- Where the fuck is this money from?
- You wanna know? You do? Fuck!
I've become a dealer! All right?
- Fuck off!
- No, you fuck off!
I got kicked out the university!
Understand? I got kicked out!
I don't know how to do anything,
all I can do is theorize molecules,
so I theorized one that gives me
what I deserve!
This dickhead's started dealing!
And I thought he had a lover!
- A lover? Don't change the subject.
- This dickhead!
- What will I say at work?
- Giulia, listen, I did it for us,
to have a decent life,
don't blow it out of all proportion.
I'll save some money
then I can quit anytime I like.
What do I tell my child?
Dad's in jail,
don't blow it out of all proportion!
Giulia, when you're stressed you talk
shit. What's jail got to do...
What child?
Pietro, I'm pregnant.
You're pregnant?
I'm sorry, when the fuck
were you going to tell me?
You're sure?
It's not a hysterical pregnancy?
Get out.
- Pietro! I'm glad you're here.
- Giulia's kicked me out,
I need somewhere to stay a couple
of nights.
There's a problem with Bartolomeo.
There are two Sinti gentlemen here,
not at all friendly, I don't want
anything to do with this.
Sinti?
Don't touch me! I can come myself,
there's no need for violence...
Pietro, don't ask, obviously
a linguistic misunderstanding,
they're talking about a marriage
I know nothing about.
Don't touch me, I'm coming.
I can come on my own...
As you know, the matrix
isn't Etruscan, but Magna Graecia.
The client was Etruscan, obviously.
I know, I'm sorry, but unfortunately
we couldn't find anything better.
I'm already looking for something
bigger, this is a bit cramped,
there's no room for the pool table,
the movie theater...
- Mattia, who are all these girls?
- I'm not really sure.
Linguistically at the pool it's Slav,
but more Latin-American indoors.
Girls, that's not an ashtray! It's
the Certamen Ciceronianum Cup '91!
Sorry, it's an international
competition. You've already lost '92.
- Arturo, what are you doing?
- The acroterion of Murlo.
It was so unexpected.
It was a real bolt from the blue.
I feel I'm ready.
You know, to be a father.
I feel I'm cut out for it,
we've been together for years,
it would be a lovely thing
to put the seal on our love.
- You want a blow job?
- What do you mean, a blow job?
I'm talking about personal dynamics
of a certain complexity...
- No blow job?
- No, no blow job, come on!
Nothing personal.
It's like I accepted.
Is there a bathroom here?
I'm sorry. A blow job.
YOU'RE AN IRRESPONSIBLE SHIT.
I HATE THIS PLACE, FUCK OFF!
- You're really getting personal!
- YOU FUCK OFF AS WELL.
All this chaos gets to her,
she'd like a place just for us.
She's right, this lot up there have
lost it, the money's changed them.
Have you noticed this place
is full of hookers?
Alberto, is that not the escort
from the other night?
No, Paprika's not an escort any more.
She works for us now, does our PR.
Alberto, go easy with that stuff.
How much are you taking?
Don't worry! You mustn't worry.
I'll send you the file
with the results this week.
- Alberto!
- It means coming in Russian. Cool!
I'm going, cos if she gets pissed,
she frightens me a bit.
Yeah! It's good, Pietro.
It's good, you need to try it.
Be good, try it,
you need to try it.
I realize I betrayed your trust.
I let you down, all of you.
Less than a week from 1,000 days. The
problem is this new stuff, it's wild.
I've taken pills before,
I'm no virgin,
but, guys, this is just unbelievable,
it's something...
I've never been so high in my life,
it's like a jet of pleasure
coming out your chest, a thing...
All right, Luca, all that's missing
is the testimonial. Excuse me.
Spatial. Definitive.
You haven't answered the phone
in 3 days. Let me in, let's talk.
Pietro, you're a drug dealer.
Be grateful I haven't reported you.
For the hundredth time, the molecule
we produced is not illegal in Italy.
Not till the Ministry's next update,
at least.
And I'm a salesman maybe, don't call
me a dealer, I don't like it!
Giulia, Giulia. Please!
I'm sorry! OK?
I'm sorry, but there must be a way
to sort things out, no?
You said you can quit anytime
you want. So quit! Now!
- Giulia, it's complicated.
- It's complicated.
There's a child involved. So we have
to talk. It's my child as well!
You want to talk? Talk, then!
Go on! I'm listening, talk.
All right, but talking with a fence
between us, with...
all the junkies watching, no,
I can't.
One dinner, that's all I'm asking
come to dinner one time.
- Goodness! What is this stuff?
- A '97 Aspero Superiore,
- very rare, 400 euros a bottle.
- It's sulfite juice!
You not got a Tenuta Sant'Elpidio,
a De la Garonne?
The lady's here. We'll discuss
the wine later, it's not good enough.
I'm sorry, the gentleman has booked
the whole place this evening.
This seat is taken, as indeed is
the whole restaurant, so, please...
You really thought you could cause
all this chaos with no consequences?
Pardon?
You and your loser friends
appearing out of nowhere
and doing as you like!
Should I be pissed?
If anyone should be pissed, it's me.
You're a...
What the fuck is this?
If it was up to me
I'd have shot you already.
But the market is king, and there's
a demand for what you make.
You're Murena?
I'm your new employer.
No, look, we don't work for anyone,
we work for ourselves...
You don't get it.
Day after tomorrow,
bring me 10 kilos of those lovely
pills you and your friends make,
and then we'll see.
Ten kilos? In two days?
You know what? I'm doing nothing!
You don't know who I am! You can't
just point your gun and...
What's your girlfriend called?
The social worker, isn't she?
All right!
- Fuck!
- Giulia?
No, it's Alberto. Pietro, something's
happened, don't be angry...
- I lost control of the coupe.
- The coupe? What coupe?
- No, I'm fine.
- Alberto, listen...
I was trying to get it out my system,
I'd a fight with Paprika...
I don't have time!
I don't have time.
No, no, wait.
I called for another reason.
When they checked the car,
inside, they found half a kilo of
our pills...
- What did you have?
- I didn't think they'd look!
The police are sneaky, they're
clever. I didn't think so...
If they ask anything, shut up,
don't say...
Hang up now.
Follow us to the station.
Alberto!
Giulia, you have to get away!
I'll come and get you...
Giulia! That's her name. I'll put
her on, I think she's a bit pissed.
Love, don't worry, it's all under
control, nothing will happen to you.
Under fucking control!
I've been kidnapped.
Kidnap? No, there are ongoing
negotiations, understand?
Things were said...
If they ask for a ransom,
don't you pay it.
Don't pay it. Because as soon as
I'm free, the first thing I'll do
is break your shitty face,
do you understand? Dickhead!
All right.
I think we've reached an agreement.
Don't touch her! You don't know what
I'm capable of. You don't know!
You're capable of making pills.
10 kilos, the day after tomorrow.
Murena, don't hang up!
Listen to me! Murena! Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Right, Petrelli, help me understand
something here.
The traffic police say you were in
the emergency lane doing 240km/h,
in a metallic grey 4002 coupe, rented
three days ago at 800 euros a day.
For a dishwasher,
you look after yourself.
Then on the rear seat
there were 8,000 euros cash,
- a night stick and a gas pistol.
- For self-defense.
But what interests me is this bag
we found with half a kilo of pills
which are being tested at the lab,
but I'd take a guess at what it is.
But anyway
it's a perfectly legal molecule.
- Says who?
- The Ministry has a list...
- How do you know all this?
- It's on the Health Ministry site.
- I'll show you on the computer.
- You trying to piss me off?
We know the drug you had in the car
really well.
You're in the researchers' gang?
What's wrong?
You thought we didn't know anything,
that you could what you liked?
You wanna have a talk
about smart drugs?
Coletti, who tells the Ministry
about the new substances?
We do, from this office, Inspector.
So you're in the right place,
Alberto!
But I don't know anything.
All I know is you can't hold me like
this, I have the right to a lawyer!
All right, all right,
you've got one over us for now.
I don't know where you got
this molecule from, but you did,
and now it's only a question of time
until the molecule becomes illegal.
Who are the others, Alberto?
Stop it with this bullshit!
Stop it!
We'll get a lawyer and get him out.
We don't know what the cops have.
You're not listening. Alberto has been speaking to
Paprika, they know everything. What's so funny?
But why Paprika? The problem's
Paprika now. Her reliability...
Will you listen for a moment?
We have to do one thing.
Do the last deal, then we break up
the gang and split up.
- And Alberto?
- Fuck Alberto!
He's a junkie who goes with hookers,
crashing sports cars.
Alberto is going to send us all
to jail, please! Come on!
We could give ourselves up.
With the mitigating factors
we might get
a very favorable sentence.
Excuse me, excuse me, one question.
We're trying to work out how to get
someone out of jail,
and you want us all to go to prison,
what the fuck is wrong with you?
It was just a suggestion.
You know what I don't get? Since
when did you have the right to speak?
You're only here cos you have
a truck. You remember that?
Said the genius of high finance
with his financial plan...
Who paid up? Who found the money
to start this business?
Who paid with his nasal septum?
They want me to get married!
That I won't is another thing,
but don't talk shit!
This really is disrespectful.
Pietro, I don't want to go to jail.
Nobody's going to jail.
We do it one last time.
Ten kilos. 100,000 a kilo. A million.
- Who do we sell a million to?
- Wholesale. To Murena.
- Who?
- Murena.
To Murena? I'll call him.
Mr. Murena, let's meet at... we give
you 10 kilos, you give us 1 million.
All right? He gets a gun, shoots us
and takes the stuff. Great idea.
No, we have a place for the deal
with more dangerous people than him.
- Where?
- Your wedding.
Fuck off! Why is it always me?
Have you seen my face?
- Why?
- It can't be done anyway.
10 kilos of pills, where will be get
the eugenol? Robbing a pharmacy?
We're robbing a pharmacy?
For example,
there's a limit to everything.
Why does everything we do
have to have a surreal twist?
What is the temperature
of our credibility with this stuff?
Are you mad? These are from
Napoleon's Italian campaign,
we just catalogued them
for the Hermitage.
These are from the second siege
of Mantua, with General Tunz!
- Yes, but do they shoot?
- They work perfectly.
- Why do we have to shoot?
- They're for if things go wrong.
What does that mean,
if things go wrong?
What I said!
If things go wrong!
So someone will stop saying
I'm only here for the truck.
Guys, am I the only person here
shitting himself?
And we also have bayonets.
If we need.
- Hands up, dickhead!
- What the fuck is this?
Hands off the counter,
don't hit the alarm or I'll shoot.
You wanna die?
Move your fucking hands!
There is no alarm!
We're not in America!
He's right, poor thing,
it's not a bank, it's a pharmacy!
I'm applying psychological pressure!
Why are you breaking my balls?
- Because you're too much.
- I do what I have to do. Move!
Take us to the drugs store. We want
everything that contains eugenol.
Shampoo, bath foam, everything!
What are you looking at? Are you
deaf? Take us to the store!
Professor Zinni! I sat computational
chemistry with you four months ago...
I thought it was strange,
standing there with bayonets!
Is this a test to see how people
react under stress?
- What the fuck?
- If things go wrong, we shoot.
- He recognized you!
- I didn't say anything to you!
We're shooting people now?
Are you mad? What are you doing?
You're supposed to be the lookout,
see if anyone's coming.
Of course someone's coming! It's
like the Siege of Leningrad, this is!
Cover your face, there are cameras!
I'm going for the truck. Hurry up!
I'll be waiting outside.
Now we'll take what we need
and leave.
What are we taking? The storeroom
has a combination lock.
You think he can punch in numbers?
He's acting! I just grazed him.
Pharmacists always act like that!
Oh, God, he's in a bad way!
I can't watch, I'll throw up.
Can you get me an antiemetic?
- He knows you, we have to kill him.
- Mattia, what the fuck?
I didn't mean to shoot,
it went off with the nerves.
- The nerves?
- Anyway, he recognized you.
- We'll all be arrested.
- So you want to shoot him?
What else? Erase his memory? Eh?
Let's get some bandages and put him
in the truck, all right?
Calm down! The situation can be
viewed from a positive point of view.
1, the guy's not dead. 2, the deal's
off. 3, I'm not getting married.
No, the deal's still on.
And you're getting married tomorrow.
What pills do we give them
if we don't have any?
We make them without eugenol.
After all this we can make them
without eugenol?
- Not really.
- And?
- I'm thinking about it.
- He's thinking about it.
Pietro, to be frank, I don't think
there's any time for thinking!
You have to tell us
what you're doing.
This is Xyrem and Vicodin, one's for
narcolepsy, the other's an opiate,
- gamma-hydroxybutyric acid.
- What's that?
It's a short-chain fatty acid
that works on the short-term memory.
We've screwed up!
We should have killed him.
Mattia, make him drink it all.
- You want to erase his memory?
- I'm trying to.
- If you can't?
- If I get the doses wrong,
He'll go from sleeping to being comatose
to dying!
Shut up! Shut up a minute!
Excuse me, Pietro!
Are you really saying you can make
people lose their memories?
Do you realize what you're saying?
Erase people's memories!
Gentlemen, this is an important
matter of life and death!
- Yes? - What did the haruspices do
in pre-Augustinian Rome?
Faced with a bad omen, the haruspex
said to abandon the operation.
- We're not abandoning anything.
- But history rarely lies!
I don't care! We said we're doing
a last deal and we're doing it.
What will we give Murena
if we've no pills?
They're not finished,
I've got one in my wallet. Here!
The number zero.
I know. Guys, trust me.
- Who are you calling now?
- A guy I give lessons to.
Now we're in the hands
of some adolescent!
Maurizio, it's Professor Zinni.
No, everything's fine.
Just one thing. Does your father
still have that catering company?
Why am I the only one out of seven
people who has to sacrifice himself?
It's not registered. It's folklore.
It's like Carnival.
- They're here. Let's start.
- I mean it.
This suit is cool, though!
Pietro, all this tension is causing
me a bit of tachycardia.
When I was young, I was diagnosed
with a little hole in my heart.
That's why I had to stop
doing sports.
- I understand.
- I had a promising career.
Arturo, don't worry,
nothing will happen.
These guys have got real guns.
What if they shoot?
A Sinti wedding is very dangerous
in itself, nobody will shoot at us.
Look,
Murena has brought his partner.
Partner, the classic pimp's woman,
a hooker,
peripatetic, a whore, a slapper
clearly, a slut, a big tart...
Look at her.
She's been round the block.
This is no circus,
this is for conjurors.
- Now you see it, now you don't!
- OK, I get it, stop it.
You know, she's not
unlike your girlfriend, no of fence.
Arturo, she is my girlfriend!
And so, by the powers conferred
on me, I declare you man and wife.
Just one moment. There's one small
formality before the celebrations,
one signature here
and that's us finished.
- It's all folklore, isn't it?
- In what sense?
- I mean, I'm just signing...
- It's for the town hall.
What do you mean, for the town hall?
- 10 kilos. If you want to weigh it.
- No need. I trust you.
But I need to try them. get me
something to drink, both of you!
Pietro, I have to tell you,
this stuff of yours is really good.
I couldn't tell you before
for leadership reasons.
The way you guys work as well,
you've got a professional group.
I always had to kind of get by with
these Neanderthals I've got...
...but one time it wasn't like that,
there weren't many like us.
- Like us?
- Like us. Why am I Murena?
Because you're a bad guy,
like the eel of the same name?
No, Murena, like the old World War II
Triton-class submarine.
He's a naval engineer, dickhead!
It's a family tradition,
my grandfather designed the keel.
I specialized in fluid dynamics,
then I got kicked out of university.
Give me that.
Cheers.
It's good, put it in the car,
Here. Look after yourself,
I'll be in touch. Bye, kid.
You told me to get some experience,
I was too much of a good kid.
Talk about slavishly
following advice!
Page 1 of the city news
in Il Messaggero! The Nerd Gang.
Then La Repubblica
which I think was a bit Manichean,
they made us out to be a gang of
graduate junkies which isn't true,
because we've all got doctorates
and only one of us was using,
and then it was a bit suggestive
with the escorts angle.
Last but not least, the masterpiece,
Leggo, which you'll have seen,
with an editorial by Fabbroni,
a writer of some note. I'll read it.
- No, wait.
- I'll read it.
When you talk, I get a headache.
This story is full of holes.
This million from the deal,
where did it go?
To nobody. There was no million.
Pietro cheated us,
the deal was ten kilos of pills
in exchange for Giulia.
- But the pills were fake?
- They were made of sugar.
It was the champagne that was
psychotropic thanks to the zero pill.
- Maurizio, listen to me.
- Tell me, I'm all fired up!
Listen to me! At a certain point,
they'll ask you for a drink.
This is all we have, you have to put
it in the drink. It's important!
I knew you were a real hot shot!
Maurizio! These are real bad guys,
they'll shoot us!
Cool!
No, no, not that one!
It's good. Put it in the car.
And the pharmacist?
Pietro needed him to get Alberto out.
We couldn't leave him in jail.
Shut up! Listen to me, quiet! Listen
to me, listen to me, listen to me!
Go to Pietro, they know everything
about the gang, smart drugs, Murena!
They'll arrest us all! Understand?
Niet?
So you're handing yourself in?
No, I'm plea bargaining. I accept
responsibility for all we did,
- but you have to let the others be.
- And why would I do that?
Because I'll give you Murena. All you
need is a road block on the Casilino.
In the trunk, you'll find enough
to put him away for ten years.
The plans was to let Murena
get caught with 10 kilos.
- But you said they were false.
- In fact, there was a plan B.
Because of that, we had to find a way
to get Murena arrested,
and kidnap was the best way. The
pharmacist wouldn't remember a thing.
What happened to the others?
This is lounge which with
its 150 square meters is a jewel,
which as you can see has a splendid
view of Rome! This is the terrace.
Giorgio and Mattia owed 40,000 euros
to the hotel
and had only one way to pay.
Yes, it's a bit claustrophobic, but
this is a bearing pillar, I'm afraid.
Bartolomeo...
The marriage turned out to be valid.
The council official was real,
so let's say he's sorted.
If someone wanted to sell a camel,
what to do you have to do?
- You don't sell the camel.
- We'll see about that.
Alberto is in recovery.
They say he's making progress.
I'm not talking about running one
or two neighborhoods, no, no!
No, I was the King of Rome!
Rome was at my feet, you understand?
No, really! Why are you laughing?
Guys, please! We know certain
substances cause confusion...
Confusion, Father? You're doubting
my months of criminal activity?
Do I challenge your spiritual path?
Excuse me! Excuse me.
- How did it go?
- Great.
He's a really lovely person.
I told him the whole story,
he listened with great interest...
- So he took you on?
- I made a gentleman's agreement,
which with someone like him
is worth a thousand contracts.
I've got a 12-18 month unpaid
apprenticeship, then we'll see.
- Unpaid.
- Yes.
I think I start Monday. Yes,
in the sense, I can't keep the dog.
I can't take it on site.
I've already risked being fired,
- all those days off.
- We'll deal with this together,
have a meeting and point out
it's a collective responsibility,
I think we need some kind
of turntable system...
So now we balance the element with
the addition of...? The addition...
Electrons. Guys, redox is at
the heart of the 4th-year program.
How do you think
you'll get your diploma?
Some of you need it to get parole...
no names, eh, Amed?
On you go, saved by the bell!
Visiting time! You need to work.
Spartaco, you started off well and
then drew up! What a struggle, eh!
But it's not bad.
The program is hard, we're at redox,
I've got all these North Africans,
they've got numbers in their blood.
Isn't that right?
Pietro, you might get out
in six months, get probation.
- Says who?
- Vittorio told me.
What does he know? He's a canon
lawyer. Penal's totally different.
Yes, but we need your teacher's
salary here. For the boy as well.
Baby, don't worry,
there's always an answer.
I've got this sword of Damocles
of good behavior hanging over me!
Can't we arrange something?
I've organized a riot in the canteen
with the Albanians.
If someone gets stabbed, I might get
another year. That's something!
No?
I CAN QUIT ANYTIME I WANT
