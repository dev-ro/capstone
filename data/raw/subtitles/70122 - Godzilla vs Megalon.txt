In 197X...
On an island near the Aleutians...
A second underground nuclear
bomb test was carried out.
This is what happened...
The effects of the
explosion were widespread
even on Monster Island
in the South Pacific.
Brother!
Hey, that looks like fun.
Want to try it?
Sure, why not?!
A drink?
- Sure.
An earthquake...
Roku!
It's an earthquake!
Come to shore!
It won't move!
Hey, the rocket!
Brother!
Brother, help me!
Hey, what's that?!
Hey, Rokuro!
Hey, over there!
Earthquakes are continuing
in many parts of the Pacific.
The National Seismic
Institute believes...
the quakes are certainly
the result of the nuclear test.
Further tremors are expected.
Incredible, isn't it?
What the hell are they
trying to do, wipe us all out?
You're right.
They'll kill the whole world off one day...
...submerge the land and drown us all.
We'll vanish, like Mu and Lamoria.
What are those places?
I've never heard of them.
It's like this...
About 3 million years ago...
...Lamoria was in the Indian Ocean,
and Mu was in the Pacific.
Both were great civilizations, until
a big earthquake destroyed them.
However, most of this is legend, and
no one is certain if they ever existed.
Hey, wouldn't it be interesting if the
earthquake destroyed your robot?
Very funny...
Here.
Brother!
What is it?
The door was open.
That's strange...
Damn!
Damn!
Professor! Professor!
Are you okay?
I'm alright.
Rokuro!
He seems to be okay.
Right!
Damn!
Damn, they really made
a mess of this place.
Brother, those guys made
a mess of my room too.
How about here?
Every room seems to be messed up,
but nothing was stolen.
Really?
But still, we'd better
make a thorough check.
Brother!
There's some funny powder
on the floor here.
What do you think it is?
It looks like sand.
Damn!
This situation is awfully strange.
They wouldn't go to
this trouble for nothing...
...so they must have been
after something of yours.
What's that?
It's a button I got
from one of those guys.
Brother, it's the same colour
as that sand I found on the floor.
You're right.
You found some sand?
What is this?
It's red sand.
It must have been from their shoes.
We found it next to the robot.
Good afternoon!
- Hey!
What are you making?
A Baby-Rider.
Baby-Rider?
You're the race car
driver. Can't you tell?
Well, I'm just an amateur.
I'm through with the water.
I'm sticking to land, where it's safe.
Do you think it will work?
You can bet on it!
You think it's okay?
It's alright.
I'm going out!
I'm going to give
it a test run. Bye-bye!
Be careful!
Come in...
Good afternoon...
Nearly finished, eh?
He's almost ready.
I've been checking
over that sand you found.
What did you find?
It comes from a stratus
30 miles beneath the sea.
You sure?
Yes. The only other place
it's found is on Easter Island.
Easter Island? Where is that?
It's a small uninhabited island
about 1300 miles southeast of Tahiti.
It's mostly famous for a
discovery that was made there:
rows of 20 meter high
statues overlooking the sea.
They're said to be over
three million years old.
This just keeps getting
more and more mysterious.
It's working!
Hey, it's working!
Congratulations!
You've done it at last!
How's this?
I think I'll name
him, Jet Jaguar.
Jet Jaguar?
That's not bad.
Hey, let's go!
Let's try it out!
Let's go try it out!
Help me!
There are TV cameras
in its eyes.
It's also equipped with
evasion devices...
...so it will always get
out of your way.
That's great!
As far as I'm concerned,
it can have the right of way!
Come in, the door's open.
It's them!
- Damn!
Seatopia. Seatopia.
This is Seatopia.
We are receiving you.
Everything has gone well.
We have managed to occupy the
laboratory, and capture the inventor as well.
Good work.
You've done well.
Program the robot so it can
guide Megalon to the target.
My people...
Today, Seatopia goes to war.
After three million years of peace,
we finally have to fight.
We do not want to, but the
people of earth leave us no choice.
With their nuclear tests, they've already
destroyed a third of our country.
We must fight for
the sake of Seatopia!
We will give the earth people
a taste of their own medicine.
But now, Seatopia goes to
war for the sake of peace!
For the sake of Seatopia!
Megalon!
Megalon!
Wake up, Megalon!
Rise to the surface of the earth!
Destroy all of man! In the name of
peace, the honor and sake of Seatopia!
Go, Megalon!
Brother!
Where's Jinkawa?
He's not here.
It's metal.
They've got us in a
metal container.
What do we do, brother?
I think they're going to kill us!
Don't worry, Rokuro.
In the meantime, try to help
me with these ropes.
Not yet!
A little more!
Brother!
Rokuro, are you okay?
Hang in there!
How much longer until
we get to the lake?
Well, it should be
around an hour, right?
Yes.
I still don't get it...
Why do you want to drop a
container into a crack in the lake bed?
What's in the thing anyway?
I guess we're not supposed to know.
We should just keep quiet
and take our Â¥100,000.
Damn it!
Where did you take the others?
Brother, got it!
The robot has made it
to the lakebed.
Everything is ready.
Roger.
The inventor will be there soon.
He's on his way now with his brother.
Roger. The elevator's on its way up and
should emerge from the lakebed soon.
Where are you taking my friends?
To the land of Seatopia.
Seatopia?
That's right.
It's a country below the
surface of the sea.
It was engulfed by an earthquake 3,000,000
years ago. Most of our people survived.
We've created our own oxygen supply,
and later we constructed our own sun.
Then the legends are true!
We are a very advanced people.
Our scientists are far superior to yours.
If you're so superior,
why steal our robot?
Seatopia has only a few people.
For the sake of our peace...
...we needed to steal
it to create an army.
Really? Then why did you
kidnap my friends?
Now you're going to tell me
where my friends are!
Speak! Speak!
Where are they?!
Haven't had enough?!
Container...
Truck...
Alright, you're free now.
Brother!
Ouch!
Are you okay?
Unit one! Unit one!
This is unit one.
This is unit one.
I'm calling from the
robot laboratory.
The prisoner I was
holding has escaped.
He will try to rescue the
professor and the robot.
You must stop him!
Megalon has arrived
on the earth's surface.
I am going to instruct
it to attack Tokyo.
Roger.
This is a special news flash.
Today at 1:30 PM...
... a new monster has emerged
from the bed of Lake Kiriyama.
At its last sighting it was heading east.
It has already attacked numerous villages.
They can't be serious!
Hey, why don't we just take the
container to the dam and dump it, okay?
That would be as good
as taking it to the lake.
No, keep driving.
That's suicide!
Unit!
Halt!
Take positions!
Brother, it feels like
we've stopped.
Brother!
What was that noise?
The monster!
You've got to get us out of here!
Hurry, there's a monster coming!
Where's the European guy?
We threw him out of the truck!
We need to lower the container!
That's crazy!
Please, use the controls!
No way!
Damn!
Rokuro! Rokuro!
Are you okay?
Professor! Professor!
Are you alright?
It's you, Jinko?
Isn't that Jet Jaguar?
You're right.
That's Jet Jaguar!
Damn, they must have
reprogrammed him!
If we could get Jet Jaguar to
contact Godzilla, he would stop him!
Alright, that's what we'll do.
What?
This is an ultra-sonic computer
transmitter that I made...
...in case the main
computer failed.
It's too late!
What's the matter?
The ultra-sonic frequency can only
reach Jet Jaguar in the line of sight.
Open fire!
You want Jet Jaguar
to find Godzilla?
Yes.
But, isn't Jet Jaguar's computer
system controlled by the enemy?
It is, but my
ultra-sonic transmitter...
...should override the main
computer's commands.
I'm sure of it!
Okay, we'll try it.
Yes, sir!
Jet Jaguar, stop!
I've lost control of the robot!
Go to Monster Island.
Find Godzilla and bring him here.
This is an emergency...
The robot's control has been
restored to the professor.
What is the robot doing now?
It's heading to Monster
Island to find Godzilla.
I see...
Stay in the robot's laboratory.
You may still have a chance
to regain control of the robot.
Roger.
I want you to contact Star-Hunter Galaxy M-1.
Have them send us Gigan right away.
Yes, sir.
Also, I want you to contact
our base at Easter Island.
Look at it now, it's all over the place.
Yes, because it's
lost its controller.
Brother, over there!
Excuse me.
Good afternoon.
Excuse me.
There's nobody in the store.
That's strange.
We've no choice.
We'll bring this back soon.
Let's go.
Damn!
Rokuro!
Brother!
Oh, you did it!
Everything is working out well.
Jet Jaguar has found Godzilla.
Really?
The monster is getting closer.
We have to hurry out of here.
What about this guy?
Let's take him.
Come on!
Hold him tight!
Forget about him.
We have to go! Hurry!
We've just received a
message from the M-1 galaxy.
Space monster Gigan has left.
It's Jet Jaguar!
Jet Jaguar is coming back!
Are you sure?
Brother, look!
Alright!
Jet Jaguar!
Professor, ask him if he
managed to call Godzilla.
What?
That was strange...
You didn't use the
ultra-sound transmitter.
Jet Jaguar, come back here!
Jet Jaguar, come back here!
Well, this thing
is useless now.
I set up Jet Jaguar's
programming with...
...a feature that enables
it to act on its own.
It's the survival program,
I'm sure of it.
Survival?
You mean that Jet Jaguar can't
be controlled by humans...
...and it's thinking on its own?
Hey, look at that.
Look, I know it could
be very dangerous...
...but I'm the one
who built Jet Jaguar.
I feel that I'm
responsible for him.
I understand now. You're just like
a father concerned about his child.
Jet Jaguar... he grew up.
I don't believe it...
But...
...he must have realised that
Godzilla needed time to get here.
Jet Jaguar must have programmed himself
to grow so he could keep the monster here.
That's Gigan, brother!
Who's side is he on?
That's not too hard to guess.
Brother, it's Godzilla!
Godzilla!
All units are to be on
immediate stand-by.
Prepare to close all
the exit points. Hurry!
Seal all the portals
to the surface!
Brother.
You did it, Jet Jaguar!
Jet Jaguar, thank you!
Jet Jaguar, let's all
go home now, okay?
Hey, let's all go home, okay?
Right?
Hey, Jet Jaguar?
Professor, the transmitter...
Jet Jaguar, let's go home.
What happened to him?
I dont know... maybe
he thinks his job is done.
But perhaps he's just waiting
for the next time he's needed again.
Let's hope that day never comes.
We should leave the people
beneath the sea in peace.
They don't want to fight
any more than we do.
