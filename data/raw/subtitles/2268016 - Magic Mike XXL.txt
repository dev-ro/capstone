OH, MY GOD,

SHOW HIM THE THING.
WOW.
THAT'S... OKAY.

OH.

THEY'RE STAYING IN CHARLESTON
TONIGHT, SO...
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S SMACK DAB ON OUR WAY.
MAYBE IT WAS MEANT TO BE.
YEAH, MAN.
GOOD WORK ON THAT,
BY THE WAY.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
DID YOU BANGEE?
[ SIGHS ] NO.
NO?
I HAVEN'T HAD ACTUAL SEX
IN ALMOST FIVE MONTHS.
EVERY TIME A CHICK GETS...
A LOOK AT IT,
SHE'S LIKE, "HOW ABOUT
A BLOW JOB OR HAND JOB?"
WELL...
JUST GOT TO FIND
THE RIGHT LADY, MAN.
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE
FOR YOU.
IT'S LIKE A BLESSING AND A CURSE
AT THE SAME TIME, HUH?
LAUGH AT MY PLIGHT.
LOOK, M-MAYBE IT'S LIKE
THE GLASS SLIPPER, MAN.
YOU JUST NEED TO FIND
THE RIGHT ONE.
DUDE, I'M 35 YEARS OLD,
OKAY?
IF IT HASN'T HAPPENED ALREADY,
IT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN.
LET'S FACE IT,
I'M PROBABLY FUCKED.
OH.
ALL RIGHT.
ON THAT NOTE, UH, LET'S GET
THIS CIRCUS BACK ON THE ROAD.
WHO WANTS TO SEE IF TARZAN DIED
IN HIS SLEEP LAST NIGHT?
FUCK THAT, MAN.
I WOKE HIM UP LAST TIME.
I'LL DO IT.
I GOT IT.
I'LL CLEAN UP
THE NONBIODEGRADABLES.
Tobias:
WHAT'S UP, BRO?
A LITTLE, UH,
BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS?
Mike: MOLLY?
YEAH.
YOU REALIZE WE'LL BE USELESS
IN AN HOUR.
WHAT ARE YOU, FUCKING 12, DUDE?
JUST TAKE IT.
OH, FUCK!
ALL RIGHT. FINE.
GUESS I KNOW
WHAT TODAY'S GONNA BE LIKE.
ALL RIGHT,
GET YOUR MOON ROCKS!
ALL RIGHT. SO WHAT'S THE PLAN
ABOUT THIS THING?
OKAY.
SO WE GOT IT ALL PLANNED OUT.
TOBIAS IS GONNA WARM UP
THE CROWD,
THEN WE'RE GONNA HIT THEM
WITH THE OLD 4th OF JULY
ARMY ROUTINE. OORAH.
Ken: THAT STILL MAKES ME
FEEL LIKE A WARMONGER
WITH EVERYTHING GOING ON
POLITICALLY RIGHT NOW.
OH, COME ON
WITH THE HIPPIE SHIT.
IT'S IN SEASON.
WE'RE DOING IT.
HEY, IF YOU WANT THAT KARMA,
GO FOR IT, ALL RIGHT?
WE'RE GONNA HIT THEM WITH
"RAINING MEN" RIGHT AFTER.
RIGHT.
THEN TOBIAS IS GONNA INTRO
THE SOLOS.
LISTEN.
I THINK YOU SHOULD BRING BACK
"PONY," BRO.
I COULD DO THAT.
AND I'M --
LOOK, "PONY" IS GREAT.
I HAVE, UH...
CAN I PITCH YOU SOMETHING?
LET ME JUST
THROW SOMETHING OUT.
AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT
I'M COMING IN AT THE 11th HOUR,
AND I DON'T WANT TO STEP
ON TOES.
BUT WHAT IF...
I MEAN, IF THIS REALLY IS
OUR LAST RIDE,
WHAT IF WE MAKE UP SOME NEW SHIT
AND GO OUT WITH A FUCKING BANG
AND JUST BURN THIS SHIT DOWN
WITH SOME NEW ROUTINES?
WE -- WE CAN'T DO THAT, MAN.
WE GOT TWO DAYS.
I MEAN, MIKE, THAT'S WHAT
WE'VE REHEARSED, MAN.
YEAH, AND DON'T CALL OUR SHIT LAME, BRO.
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT CALLING
YOUR SHIT LAME.
I'M JUST SAYING THAT COWBOYS
AND FIREMEN DANCING TO '80s ROCK
IS NOT -- NOT LAME.
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT IS LAME?
LOOKING LIKE A BAG OF DICKS
AT OUR LAST CONVENTION
'CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE
OUR FUCKING ACT STRAIGHT.
OKAY.
POINT TAKEN.
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION,
THOUGH.
UM... OKAY.
YOU'RE STILL DOING, UH,
THE FIREMAN ROUTINE, RIGHT?
YOU KNOW IT.
ALL RIGHT.
HAVE YOU EVER WANTED TO BE
A FIREMAN?
A REAL ONE?
YES, A REAL FIREMAN.
NO.
I GOT THE PHOBIA THING.
YOU HAVE A FIRE PHOBIA.
OKAY.
SO, UH, YOU STILL DOING IT
TO THAT -- THAT KISS SONG?
FUCK, YEAH.
"HOTTER THAN HELL."
"HOTTER THAN HELL."
DO YOU LIKE THAT SONG?
CRUSHES.
I KNOW IT CRUSHES,
BUT DO YOU LIKE IT?
DO YOU PLAY IT
WHEN YOU'RE NOT ONSTAGE?
I DON'T SEE YOUR POINT
HERE.
MY POINT IS, IF YOU DON'T
LIKE IT, WHY DID YOU PICK IT?
WELL, I DIDN'T PICK IT.
DALLAS DID.
EXACTLY MY POINT.
DALLAS PICKED IT.
YOU DIDN'T PICK IT, SO IT'S NOT
ON THE INSIDE. YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST BECAUSE YOU MADE UP SOME OF
YOUR OWN ROUTINES BACK IN THE DAY
DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU GET TO
WALTZ BACK IN HERE
AFTER THREE YEARS AND TRY TO
TELL US HOW TO RUN OUR OWN SHIT.
I'M NOT TRYING TO TELL YOU
WHAT THE FUCK TO DO. NO!
I'M JUST SAY--
THERE IS NO FUCKING UNIVERSE
IN WHICH I AM NOT DOING
THAT FIREMAN ROUTINE!
YOU CAN FIND IT, MAN.
YOU GOT TO JUST, LIKE,
LET GO, OKAY?
I FUCKING GOT IT!
WHAT? WHAT?
YO, IT'S LIKE
A FUCKING REAL WEDDING,
EXCEPT LIKE A FANTASY.
Ken: OH, MY GOD, DUDE!
AND, LIKE, I GO OUT IN THE CROWD...
YES!
...AND FIND MYSELF, LIKE,
A REAL FUCKING BRIDE.
OH, FUCK! AND I DO
EVERYTHING WITH HER!
LIKE, I'LL HAVE A RING
AND EVERYTHING,
AND I'LL PROPOSE TO HER, AND PEOPLE
THROW RICE. THEY ARE THROWING RICE!
RICE OUT OF OUR FUCKING PANTS! YES.
DUDE, THEY'RE FUCKING --
THEY'RE ALL -- EVERYONE'S THROWING RICE.
IT'S JUST SO COMPLEX.
OR BIRDSEED. WHAT ARE YOU
FUCKING TALKING ABOUT, MAN?!
YO, MAN, I'M NOT
A FUCKING DANCER LIKE YOU.
I JUST CAN'T COME UP WITH SHIT
ON THE SPOT.
NO, IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT ABOUT
BEING A DANCER, RICHIE.
IT'S NOT.
OKAY, LOOK.
"PONY" -- IT'S NOT -- THAT
WASN'T A DANCE ROUTINE, OKAY?
ALL IT WAS IS I WAS AT A PARTY
AND SAW THIS BADASS GIRL.
AND SHE WAS WITH
HER BOYFRIEND,
AND HE DID NOT LOOK LIKE
HE WAS HITTING THAT SHIT RIGHT.
SO THAT -- THAT SONG CAME ON,
AND ALL I DID WAS JUST --
ALL I DID WAS JUST, LIKE,
IMAGINE WHAT I WOULD DO TO HER.
THAT WAS IT.
THAT WAS ALL "PONY" EVER WAS.
NO, MAN.
IT SOUNDS FUCKING COMPLEX.
WHY IS THAT -- NO, IT'S NOT.
LOOK AT -- LOOK AT YOU!
YOU'RE A FUCKING
GREEK GOD.
YOU COULD FUCKING TIE
YOUR SHOE
AND MAKE SOME GIRL'S
ENTIRE YEAR, MAN.
IT'S JUST GOT TO COME FROM
IN HERE.
SERIOUSLY? YOU JUST HAVE TO BE YOU.
YEAH. I KNOW SO.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FUCK THAT.
I BET YOU YOU CAN GO IN THERE
RIGHT NOW --
I BET YOU YOU CAN GO IN THERE
AND FUCKING MAKE HER DAY.
WHO, HER? Tarzan: HELL, YEAH.
HELL, YEAH.
THAT GIRL LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S NEVER FUCKING SMILED
IN HER ENTIRE FUCKING LIFE.
THEN THAT'S YOUR GOAL.
THAT IS YOUR GOAL. ALL THE
MORE REASON, MAN. WHAT?
YOU GOT TO GO IN THERE
AND MAKE HER SMILE. NO!
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO.
YES.
AND IF YOU -- LOOK.
IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT,
THEN NO ONE FUCKING CAN,
AND I'LL GO BACK AND DO
THE FUCKING OLD ROUTINES.
OH, FUCK! THAT'S A FAIR DEAL.
THAT'S A FAIR DEAL.
YOU'RE NOT A FUCKING --
YOU'RE NOT A FIREMAN, RICHIE!
YOU'RE NOT A FIREMAN.
I WANT TO HEAR YOU SAY IT.
"I'M NOT A FIREMAN."
"I AM NOT A FIREMAN."
I WANT TO HEAR YOU SAY --
WELL, I'M NOT A FUCKING FIREMAN.

REIKI.
I'M A LEVEL-3 HEALER.
OH, SHIT.
[ SIGHS ]
THIS FUCKING SUCKS.
NO FUCKING M.C.

THAT WAS A BRILLIANT IDEA.
THROWING THE FUCKING COSTUMES

IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?
AW.

BECAUSE LIFE ISN'T EXACTLY
THE WAY HE WANTS IT RIGHT NOW?
OH, OKAY, MR. C.E.O.
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
YOUR BULLSHIT ADVICE
AND GIVE IT
TO YOUR FUCKING EMPLOYEES?
EMPLOYEES?
I HAVE ONE EMPLOYEE.
AND I CAN'T EVEN PAY
FOR HIS HEALTHCARE.
BUT I BUST MY ASS EVERY MONTH
TO KEEP IT GOING.
SO DON'T ACT LIKE
WE DON'T ALL HAVE PROBLEMS.
ALL RIGHT?
OH, WHATEVER, MAN.
I'M THE ONE WHO TOLD YOU COMING
WITH US WAS A HORRIBLE IDEA.
OH, IT'S BEEN THE YEAR
OF THE HORRIBLE IDEA, MAN.
YOU WANT TO SEE
ANOTHER HORRIBLE IDEA?
I GOT ONE FOR YOU.
BAM.

THERE'S A NICE, JUICY
HORRIBLE IDEA FOR YOU.
BROOKE SAID NO?
LOOK, I HAD MY LIFE
ALL PLANNED OUT WITH HER.
ALL RIGHT? I --
IT WAS ALL PERFECTLY SET UP.
I HAD THE HOUSE,
I HAD THE DOG,
I HAD "DOWNTON ABBEY"
ON THE WEEKENDS.
I EVEN DID THE PROPOSAL
ON THE BEACH
WITH BACON AND MIMOSAS
AND PANCAKES AND ALL THAT.
AND FOR WHATEVER REASON
THAT I'LL PROBABLY NEVER
UNDERSTAND...
SHE WANTED SOMETHING ELSE.
SO I CAME ON THIS TRIP
WITH YOU FUCKS
TO JUST TRY TO GET ON
WITH IT.
SO I'M GONNA BE DAMNED
IF I'M GONNA JUST LET IT END
RIGHT HERE AND NOW.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT.
WE CAN'T LET THE TRAIN
STOP HERE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
NO.
WE GOT A TSUNAMI OF DOLLAR BILLS
TO GET TO, DADDY.
OH, WE'RE ON A MISSION.
FUCK, YEAH.
LOOK, WE'LL GET ANOTHER M.C.
RIGHT, TOBIAS?
THAT'S THE ENERGY
I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT THERE.
LOOK, WE'LL PICK HIM UP
ON THE WAY HOME.
ALL WE GOT TO DO
IS GET A RENTAL CAR.
WE'RE NOT GONNA NEED
A RENTAL CAR, I DON'T THINK.
THIS IS ANOTHER HORRIBLE IDEA,
BUT...
I KNOW AN M.C. IN SAVANNAH.
* *
GENTLEMEN.
HEY.
HOW CAN I BE
OF SERVICE?
UH, IS ROME IN TONIGHT?
ARE YOU A MEMBER, SIR?
N-NO.

AND --
JUST IF YOU COULD GET MY NAME

THE TRICK,
I GUESS WE'LL JUST STOP
BOTHERING YOU.
[ MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYING ]

THREE YEARS AGO.
BUT YET HERE YOU ARE.
YOU GOT MY CURIOSITY,
MIKE.
FLOOR IS YOURS.
NO.
I WAS JUST IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
AND WANTED TO SEE
IF I COULD STOP BY AND BORROW
A CUP OF BROWN SUGAR.
[ SIGHS ]
BOY, I TELL YOU,
SHIT DON'T CHANGE, HUH?
ALWAYS GOT TO LEAD
WITH A JOKE
BEFORE YOU ASK
FOR WHAT YOU WANT.
NO.
SO, WHAT DID YOU DO,
TURN THIS PLACE INTO SOME SORT
OF A COUNTRY CLUB OR SOMETHING?
GUESS YOU COULD SAY THAT.
YOU KNOW, BACK IN THE DAY
IN THE ROMAN EMPIRE,
AS LONG AS YOU PAID THE EMPEROR
YOUR TAXES,
YOU COULD WORSHIP
WHO YOU WANTED,
WHERE YOU WANTED,
HOW YOU WANTED.
FREEDOM HAD A SMALL PRICE.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE VALUE
MORE THAN FREEDOM, MIKE?
PLEASE SAY STRIPPERS.
NOPE.
BEAUTY.
SO, IF BEAUTY IS SOMETHING
YOU REALLY WISH TO BEHOLD,
YOU CAN BEHOLD ALL THE BEAUTY
YOU WANT RIGHT HERE.
ALL I ASK IS FOR
A LITTLE MONTHLY FEE, YOU KNOW?
[ CHUCKLES ]
SO IT'S A SUBSCRIPTION-BASED
PLEASURE THAT YOU'RE SELLING?

A CONVENTION FOR, MIKE?
YOU DON'T.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.
WOULD YOU LET ME FINISH, PLEASE?
WILL YOU JUST -- NO. UNH-UNH. NO.
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO YOU
FOR EIGHT YEARS
SINCE YOU WALKED OUT ON ME.
OH, DID I WALK OUT ON YOU?
BECAUSE IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,
I WENT AND TOOK A JOB.
AND WHEN I CAME BACK, SOMEONE
WOULDN'T LET ME IN THE HOUSE.
MIKE, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT YOU CAN COME UP IN HERE
AFTER ALL THIS TIME
AND SNAP YOUR FINGERS
AND I'M SUPPOSED TO DO A FAVOR
FOR YOU?
OKAY.
MAYBE... I'M -- I'M AN IDIOT.
I'M SORRY.
I-I'M NOT SAYING THAT
AT ALL.
REALLY?
I DON'T NEED A FAVOR
FROM YOU.
FUCK THE CONVENTION.
DON'T --
ALL IT IS IS AN EXCUSE
FOR US TO TRY TO PUT
THIS SHIT BETWEEN US TO BED.
THAT'S ALL.
OH, SHIT.
[ MUSIC CONTINUES ]
THANK YOU, OCTAVIUS.
OOH.
YOU'RE WONDERFUL.
MY QUEENS, GATHER.
I NEED YOU.

YOU EVER HAD A GHOST
COME TO YOUR FRONT DOOR?
A GHOST FROM YOUR PAST,
ONE THAT STILL MAKES YOU SHIVER?
[ WOMEN MURMURING, CHEERING ]
I HAD ONE TODAY.
SO I NEED YOUR HELP.
I NEED YOU
TO HELP ME MAKE A DECISION
OF WHETHER I SHOULD LEAVE
THAT GHOST IN HIS GRAVE
OR GIVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY
TO BE RESURRECTED.
Women:
RESURRECTED!
Rome:
OKAY.
I GOT A LITTLE TREAT FOR Y'ALL
TONIGHT.
IT'S A MAN I KNEW...

YEAH.
WE GOT TO GET ON THE ROAD.
THIS WAS, UH,
THIS WAS FUN --
WHATEVER, I GUESS,
THAT THIS WAS.
IT WAS GOOD SEEING YOU.
LIKEWISE.
Richie:
SO... WHAT WAS THAT?
Y'ALL USED TO DANCE
TOGETHER?
Mike:
UH, YEAH.
LOOK, IT'S A...
[ LAUGHS ]
IT'S A LONG, LONG STORY, BUT,
UH, ROME AND I MET EACH OTHER
AT A VERY INTERESTING TIME
IN OUR LIVES,
AND -- AND, UH, I GUESS YOU
COULD SAY THAT WE HAD A THING.
MM. YEAH.
I'D SAY YOU HAD A THING.
YEAH.
WELL, UNTIL I, UH,
I WENT TO WORK WITH DALLAS.
YEAH.
SO... IS SHE GONNA COME HELP US
OR WHAT?
NO. [ LAUGHS ]
NO.
I DON'T -- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S GONNA ACTUALLY HAPPEN.
ROME LIKES TO STAY
IN HER CASTLE.
THAT'S WHY SHE BUILT IT.
SO, UH, I GETTING ON 95 NORTH,
RIGHT?
YEAH. YEAH.
IT'S JUST OUTSIDE OF CHARLESTON.
SHE TEXTED ME THE ADDRESS.
I DON'T KNOW.
I'LL TELL YOU
WHEN WE GET CLOSER.
YOU NEED A CO-PILOT?
YES, PLEASE.
OKAY.
THAT WAS INSANE TONIGHT,
MAN.
THANKS. I'M SERIOUS, DUDE.
THAT WAS LIKE...
IT WAS A GOOD NIGHT.
I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YOU.
YOUR STUFF IS REVOLUTIONARY,
MAN.
SOMETIMES THE SONGS
ARE A LITTLE...
NO, MAN. IT WAS PERFECT.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
I APPRECIATE THAT. AND YOU
JUST MADE THAT UP ON THE SPOT.
I -- WELL, ROME LIKES US
TO PUT OUR PASSION IN OUR WORK.
WELL, IT SHOWS, MAN.
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.
ARE YOU DOING ANYTHING ELSE
WITH YOUR MUSIC?
MAN, I'M TRYING.
I PUT IT UP ONLINE.
HOPEFULLY, LIKE, IT'LL SPREAD
THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA,
BUT HONESTLY, WITH THIS E.P.
THAT'S COMING OUT, IT'S...
OH, COOL, MAN.
IT'S HARD TO GET PEOPLE
TO PAY ATTENTION TO IT.
'CAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH SHIT THAT COMES
ON THE INTERNET EVERY DAY. OH. SO MUCH.
I JUST WANT TO STAY
AUTHENTIC.
YEAH. WELL,
AT LEAST YOU'RE TRYING, MAN.
AT LEAST YOU'RE TRYING.
THAT'S WHY I MOVED
DOWN TO FLORIDA BACK IN THE DAY,
ACTUALLY,
WAS TO DO MUSIC STUFF.
REALLY?
YEAH. YEAH.
I SANG
IN "DREAM ALONG WITH MICKEY"
AT DISNEY WORLD
FROM '03 TO '05.
[ LAUGHS ]
WHAT?
YEAH, MAN.
FOR REAL.
I MEAN, I STARTED OUT
AS THE DONALD DUCK UNDERSTUDY,
BUT I -- I WAS PLAYING MICKEY
BY MY SECOND YEAR.
I GOT SIGNED BY AN AGENT,
BOOKED A COUPLE
REGIONAL COMMERCIAL SPOTS.
AND ONE DAY I HEARD AN AD ON
THE RADIO LOOKING FOR DANCERS.
AND YOU KNOW HOW THAT SHIT GOES,
SO...
WHEN I STARTED THIS,
I THOUGHT --
MAN, I THOUGHT I'D HATE IT.
BUT NOW, IF THE -- IF, LIKE,
THE E.P. BLEW UP TOMORROW,
I'D PROBABLY STILL DO THIS
ON THE SIDE.
WHAT?
I'M SERIOUS.
YOU'RE SHITTING ME.
DO YOU SEE HOW MANY GIRLS I MEET
EVERY DAY?
YES.
FOR FREE?
FOR FREE!
I DON'T GOT TO PAY FOR --
ALL I DO IS SING.
AND YOU THINK ABOUT THAT.
LIKE, THESE GIRLS HAVE TO DEAL
WITH MEN IN THEIR LIVES
EVERY DAY WHO --
THEY DON'T LISTEN TO THEM.
THEY DON'T ASK THEM
WHAT THEY WANT.
THEY DON'T EVEN ASK THEM
WHAT THEY WANT.
ALL WE GOT TO DO IS ASK THEM
WHAT THEY WANT.
AND WHEN THEY TELL YOU,
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING, MAN.
IT'S LIKE WE'RE LIKE...
WE'RE LIKE HEALERS OR SOMETHING.
YES, MAN.
FUCK, YES.
WE ARE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
WE'RE HEALERS.
WE'RE HEALERS, MAN.
WE CAN BE.
OKAY. YEAH. WE CAN BE.
WE CAN BE.
OKAY.
I LIKE THAT.

HE'S A PAINTER.
MOM,
THEY'RE MALE STRIPPERS.
Nancy: NOW, THAT MAKES SENSE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO
IN THE FIRST PLACE?
BECAUSE IT'S FUCKING AWKWARD
TO DO SOMEBODY LIKE THAT.
ENOUGH WITH THAT FUCKING LANGUAGE!
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, GOD, I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER HAD
A REAL LIVE STRIPPER
IN MY HOUSE BEFORE.
Ken:
YOU HAVE NOW.
UH, WELL, ACTUALLY,
THE -- THE TECHNICAL TERM IS --
IS MALE ENTERTAINER.
OH, MY!
MOM, THEY'RE NOT HERE FOR THAT.
THEY'RE JUST FRIENDS.
OF COURSE NOT!

AND GRAB US SOME MORE VINO.
NO, NO, NO.
DON'T -- DON'T YOU WORRY.
I GOT THIS. I'LL RELOAD, NANCY.
OKAY, BABY.

ANYTHING THAT LOOKS EXPENSIVE.
AS MUCH OF THE GOOD STUFF
AS YOUR LITTLE ARMS CAN CARRY,

YOU GOT IT.
I-I GOT ARMS.
I'LL HELP.
[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ]
ARE YOU NATIVE AMERICAN,
TITO?

Tito:
YES, ON MY MOTHER'S SIDE.
REALLY, I'VE GOT IT.
THANKS, THOUGH.
OH, YOU DO NOT HAVE IT.
BY WHAT I JUST SAW
UP THERE,
WE ARE GONNA NEED A FUCKING
PACK MULE TO WATER THAT BUNCH.
SO -- I DON'T KNOW.
LET'S FUCKING DO THIS.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO
BE IN NEW YORK, BY THE WAY.
OH, WAIT.
IS THAT NOT WHERE WE ARE?
WOW.
HMM?
I CHANGED MY MIND.
SO DOES THAT MEAN
YOU ARE GONNA BE ON THE POLE
OR YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
ON THE POLE?
BECAUSE, I MEAN,
"DOLLY TITZ ON THE MAIN STAGE,
COMING UP FOR YOU, BOYS.
GET YOUR DOLLAR BILLS OUT
AND LET'S BRIGHTEN UP HER DAY"
SOUNDS AWESOME TO ME.
HA HA.
NICE CALLBACK, CLITORIA.
IT'S LOW-HANGING FRUIT.
I CAN'T HELP MYSELF.
WHAT'S THE PLAN NOW,
THEN?
CURRENTLY?
YEP.
FIND THE PERFECT DYNAMITE
FOR THAT POWDER KEG UPSTAIRS
AND... WATCH IT BLOW.
OKAY.
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?
SOMETHING OLD AND EXPENSIVE --
TO FIT IN UPSTAIRS.
COOL.
THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME
TO ME.
RACIST.
HMM?
1959 CHâTEAU LAFITE.
THAT'LL DO.
Richie:
YOU SEE, WHAT I HEAR
IS THAT GUY ISN'T TAKING CARE
OF HIS OWN SHIT.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA EXPECT
YOUR LADY TO TRIM THE HEDGES,
IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO...
PRUNE THE TREE?

SEE, I HAVE A THREE-DAY
MAX-GROWTH RULE.

ABSO-FUCKING-LUTELY, MA'AM.
WOW.
PARDON MY LANGUAGE.
OH, PLEASE.
WE GOT WINE!
[ ALL CHEERING ]
A BASKET FULL OF WINE!
[ LAUGHS ]
WE GOT A BASKET OF WINE.
Nancy: YOU ARE MISSING OUT
ON SOME HUSBAND TALES IN HERE.
OR EX-HUSBAND TALES.
JULIA AND I ARE TRYING TO LURE
MAE AND DIANA
OVER TO THE DARK SIDE.
USE THE FORCE, NANCE.
COME ON, MAE.
IT'S YOUR TURN.

HERE'S A WHOPPER FOR YOU.
HERE WE GO.
ROGER'S THE ONLY MAN
I'VE EVER SLEPT WITH.
THEN YOU ARE GONNA GET
MORE WINE.
[ LAUGHS ]
[ Sighing ]
YEAH.
I LOST MY VIRGINITY TO HIM WHEN
I WAS 17, AND THAT WAS THAT.
TWO BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS,
BUT ONLY ONE PENIS
MY ENTIRE FUCKING LIFE.
SADLY, I WAS TOO NAIVE TO
RECOGNIZE THAT HE WAS A GAY MAN.
MOM,
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
OH, I KNEW ENOUGH.
I KNEW HE REALLY LIKED IT
WHEN I PUT MY FING--
MOM! NO. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT.
HEY!
WELL, YOU NEED TO HEAR THIS!
IT'S NOT SO TERRIBLE.
BECAUSE I PISSED AWAY
ALL OF THIS ON ONE MAN.
AND YOU ARE NOT GONNA MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKE.
Megan: GOT IT.
THAT'S WHY I TELL THESE GIRLS
TO PLAY THE FIELD.
AND DON'T STOP
UNTIL YOU FIND ONE
THAT ROCKS
YOUR FUCKING SOCKS OFF!
Ken: MY MOTTO.
HEAR, HEAR.
Tarzan: WELL, YOU KNOW, NANCY,
THAT PLAYS BOTH WAYS.
I THINK I'VE HAD
AS GOOD A RUN AS ANYBODY.
BUT I'D TRADE ALL THAT
IN A HEARTBEAT
TO COME HOME TO A WIFE, A KID,
PEOPLE THAT LOVE ME.
THAT HOLE IS NEVER
GONNA BE FILLED.
THAT SHIP FUCKING SAILED.
WOW.
Ken: I THINK MY SOUL JUST DIED
A LITTLE BIT.
Tito:
I LOVE YOU, ERNIE.
WELL, HANK AND I HAVE NEVER HAD
SEX WITH THE LIGHTS ON.
WHAT?
EVERY TIME IT STARTS,
HE JUST GOES AND TURNS 'EM OFF.
AND I TRY TO DROP HINTS,
BUT, UM...
MAYBE IT'S ME.
I DON'T KNOW.
Nancy:
COME ON. NEVER ONCE?
NEVER.
Ken: HE'S NOT SHOWING YOU
HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE.
NO. YOU'RE GORGEOUS --
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
SHE'S GORGEOUS, RIGHT?
AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING
ABOUT THE PAINT JOB.
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
THIS VESSEL.
I'M TALKING ABOUT
WHAT'S INSIDE YOU.
I READ ENERGY
IN MY WORK,
AND -- AND YOURS IS PURE AND
SWEET AND LOVING AND NURTURING.
YOU GOT TO TALK TO HIM.
'CAUSE IF HE'S NOT GONNA
WORSHIP YOU,
THERE'S A LOT OF GUYS OUT THERE
WHO WILL.
AND THE LINE STARTS
RIGHT HERE.
WINDS AROUND THIS ROOM, TOO.
YEP. ABSOLUTELY.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
GOOD. DON'T -- NO, NO.
DON'T GET SHY ON ME.
YOU NEED TO SAY IT.
I WANT TO HEAR YOU SAY IT.
OWN IT.
WELL, I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO HIM.
WELL, TELL HIM
WHAT YOUR FANTASY IS.
AND MAKE SURE HE DOES IT
WITH THE LIGHTS ON.
IF HE DOESN'T, THEN Y'ALL HAVE
A SERIOUS PROBLEM.
WELL, I, UM...
WHEN WE WERE IN COLLEGE
AND WE WERE FALLING IN LOVE,
WE USED TO LISTEN TO THAT SONG,
UM, "HEAVEN."
OH, SHIT.
YES!
I LOVE THAT SONG.
* OH, THINKING ABOUT
ALL OUR YOUNGER YEARS *
[ CHEERING ]
* THERE WAS ONLY YOU AND ME *
* WE WERE YOUNG AND WILD
AND FREE *
WILL YOU HOLD THIS FOR ME?
MM-HMM. YEAH. COME ON!
* NOW NOTHING CAN TAKE YOU AWAY

* WE'VE BEEN DOWN THAT ROAD
BEFORE *
* BUT THAT'S ALL OVER NOW *

* AND LOVE IS ALL THAT I NEED *
* AND I FOUND IT
THERE IN YOUR HEART *
* IT ISN'T TOO HARD TO SEE
WE'RE IN HEAVEN *
[ LAUGHTER ]
DO YOU FEEL GOOD?
YEAH, BABY.
WHOO!
THAT'S WONDERFUL!
I DON'T THINK HANK
CAN DO THAT.

THE DOCTOR HAS CHECKED
INTO THE BUILDING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, THANK YOU.
YEAH!
FUCK, KEN!
WHAT THE FUCK?

[ LAUGHS ]
OH, GOD,

I WISH WE HAD KNOWN YOU GUYS
BACK IN OUR DAY, YOU KNOW?
WELL, I'D SAY
IT'S STILL YOUR DAY, MA'AM.

[ LAUGHS ]
OH, MY GOD.
JUST LOOK AT YOU.
YOU ARE JUST PERFECT.
DAMN!
[ LAUGHTER ]
OH, GOD.
OH, DAMN, LOOK AT YOU.
Julia: HERE IT COMES.
I HATE TO BE RUDE, BUT...
YOU WANT TO POP THE HOOD.
[ SIGHS ]
OH, SHIT.
[ CHEERING, LAUGHTER ]
OH, MY GOD!
Megan: MOM!
Nancy: OH, PLEASE!
OF COURSE YOU'RE --
YOU'RE EATING CAKE BY YOURSELF
WHEN, UH, THE FIREWORKS
ARE ABOUT TO GO OFF IN THERE.
THIS ISN'T CONCERNING
AT ALL.
WHAT CAN I SAY?
I LIKE CAKE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE?
A LADY IS ABOUT TO GET --
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO PUT IT INTO WORDS.
NO.
I'M A COOKIE GUY.
WHAT?
YEAH.
IT'S RED FUCKING VELVET.
I WOULD TAKE A PACK OF OREOS
OVER THAT BULLSHIT
ANY DAY OF THE WEEK.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
NOTHING'S WRONG.
'CAUSE COOKIES ARE AWESOME.
WELL, I DON'T THINK
WE HAVE ANYTHING MORE
TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER.
LOOK, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT OR WHATEVER --
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S ABOUT NEW YORK --
BUT I MAYBE INTUIT
THAT IT MIGHT BE --
I'M GONNA START HIDING
THE KITCHEN KNIVES IN A MINUTE.
SERIOUSLY,
IT IS THAT OBVIOUS.
WHAT'S UP?
I MET A PHOTOGRAPHER IN MIAMI
AT THIS PARTY I WAS WORKING AT.
HE WAS NICE AND MARRIED
AND ALL OF THAT.
MM.
TOOK A LOOK AT MY PHOTOS
AND SAID I HAD AN EYE.
OFFERED ME A JOB RIGHT THERE
ON THE SPOT AS HIS ASSISTANT.
THAT'S COOL.
I MEAN, DID HE OFFER A PLACE
FOR YOU TO STAY AS WELL
THAT HAPPENED TO BE HIS HOUSE
WHEN HIS WIFE WAS AWAY?
THAT...
YEAH.
WAIT.
WERE YOU THERE?
I WAS THERE, BUT I WAS IN DRAG.
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE RECOGNIZED ME.
MM. BUT I JUST WANT TO THROW
THIS OUT THERE, THOUGH.
UM, THIS MIGHT BE GOD'S WAY
OF GIVING YOU A SECOND CHANCE
AT MYRTLE BEACH.
MM.
ANY GOD WORTH BELIEVING IN
CERTAINLY SENDS YOU DUDES
IN THONGS WHEN IN NEED.
OR SHE JUST KNOWS
THAT SOME ASSHOLE IN MIAMI --
SHE?
YES, MY GOD IS A SHE.
UM, SHE JUST MIGHT KNOW THAT --
I DON'T KNOW --
SOME ASSHOLE IN MIAMI STOLE YOUR
SMILE AND YOU NEED IT BACK.
AND I CAN GUARANTEE YOU
THAT STRIPPERS WILL GIVE
SMILES APLENTY
AND MAKE YOU FORGET
ABOUT NEW YORK.
AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, THEN
THERE WILL BE 3,000 WOMEN THERE,
SEEING AS YOU'RE NOT
IN A BOY PHASE.
THAT'S QUITE A PITCH.
MM.
LOOK, WHEN SHIT'S NOT GOING
YOUR WAY,
GETTING A LITTLE CRAZY
WITH SOME RANDOM FRIENDS
HAS A WAY OF HELPING YOU
SORT OUT YOUR OWN SHIT.
SO I'M YOUR FRIEND NOW?
YOU'VE SEEN ME PEE.
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE THAT'S NOT
MY FRIEND THAT'S SEEN ME PEE.
FAIR ENOUGH.
LOOK, I DON'T NORMALLY TRUST
A COOKIE GUY...
BUT I'LL --
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
THAT'S VALID.
[ LAUGHTER IN DISTANCE ]
ALL RIGHT.
