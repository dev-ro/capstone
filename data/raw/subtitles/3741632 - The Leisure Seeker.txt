- Hey.
- Hi.
Mom?
It's me.
You ready?
Jane will be
here any minute.
I made a
cake for dad.
Oh, God. Is
this a joke?
- Will.
- Hey, Lillian.
I'm glad I
got you alone.
I wanted to tell you
that if you guys get busy
with your mom
at the hospital,
I'm more than happy
to look in on your dad.
- But they're not here.
- What?
The house is empty.
I tried to call, but...
I think mom's turned off
the cell phone we bought her.
Come to think of it,
I heard someone
turning on an engine
this morning very early.
What engine? Dad's
car's right here.
Oh...
- Oh, my God.
- I don't believe it.
Jane. Mom
and Dad are gone.
And you won't
believe it.
So is the
Leisure Seeker.
Take a right here.
That's it. Good.
Couldn't you have worn something
more comfortable to travel in?
And I think you've exaggerated
a bit with the eau de cologne.
But you do
smell nice.
- Darling?
- Mmm-hmm?
Did you fart?
Excuse me?
You did.
I did not.
You can't be talking like that.
What are you saying?
Hon, do we
need gas?
We need gas.
Let's stop
at Stuckey's.
We could get one
of those pecan logs.
- Where?
- Our Stuckey's, hon.
Try to remember.
Okay, boss.
Just as you say.
Like always.
Yeah, right.
♪ You have no
place for us
♪ In your reverie
♪ Goodbye, my love... ♪
Hey, are you crazy?
Is the store closed?
Oh, we really wanted one
of your delicious pecan logs.
- Opening soon. Just gas now.
- Oh, no. You hearing this, hon?
Every summer, we'd head south,
we always stopped at Stuckey's.
Our kids, Jane and Will, they just
had to have their pecan logs.
We were visiting my family in South
Carolina. That's where I'm from.
My husband John, on the other hand,
he's a real Yankee, born and bred.
- Uh, okay.
- Oh, they were wonderful trips, weren't they, John?
Well, I guess I'm just
a natural born tourist.
I love to travel.
Smoky Mountains,
Six Flags, Williamsburg.
You ever been to
any of these places?
- We're from Syria.
- You are?
Oh, how interesting.
Well, you should go.
They are amazing.
- Ninety one dollars, ma'am.
- Yes, of course.
My husband John, on
the other hand,
he's a much more sophisticated
traveler than I am.
He thinks travel should "broaden
the intellectual horizons,"
whatever that's
supposed to mean.
I just love chatting
with different people.
Here.
There you are.
- Have a nice trip.
- Let's roll, hon.
Nice visiting with you.
Wait, wait,
wait. Wait, wait.
Wait. Wait,
wait, wait.
What a nice woman. She found
one in the storeroom.
Its expiration date is,
oh, my goodness, last April.
I think it'll still be all right.
Would you like a little taste, hon?
I want a burger.
It's not lunchtime yet.
I want a burger.
Hi. My name is Chantal,
and I'll be your server.
Hi, Chantal.
I'm Ella. This is John.
Guess you're stuck with us.
- I want a burger.
- Might I recommend the Chow Attack?
Only $9.99. That comes
with a burger,
large fries, a slice of apple
pie and a Happy Swirl.
"A Happy Swirl"?
I have no idea what that could be,
but it sure sounds promising.
- I want a burger.
- So we'll have
a Chow Attack
for Mr. Grumpy here.
Okay. And you, madam?
- Just water.
- Nothing to eat?
I'll just take a little sip
of his Happy Swirl.
Okay. Would you like anything
else to drink? Coke? Beer?
- No, that'll be fine, thank you.
- I want a burger.
- Burger, please.
- Uh, that'll be all, Chantal. Thank you.
You're so welcome.
I'm just gonna
stretch my legs.
- You stay put.
- Okay.
Okay.
Do not move.
I know,
Dr. Tomashevski.
I'm fully aware.
I'm not sure
what else to say.
I'm just hoping that
they haven't gone too far.
I understand.
Okay.
Doctor, my brother just pulled up. We'll
let you know if we hear anything.
- Any news?
- So?
I checked all
the supermarkets.
Nothing.
I seem to remember
it was your brilliant idea
that they keep
that monstrosity.
Nice work, kiddo.
There has to be
some sort of explanation.
- Yeah. They ran away.
- But from who?
- Hello?
- Will.
Mom, where the
fuck are you?
Will, honey, please don't use
that language with me.
- Never mind the language.
- You need to calm down.
If you raise your
voice, I'll hang up.
Mom, what is
this craziness?
You knew I was coming to get
you. Why are you not here?
We're just taking a little trip, Jane.
We won't be gone long.
"A little trip"? Where?
This is just something I really
need to do with your father.
I can't believe this.
We decided everything.
Will was gonna stay with dad.
I was gonna come...
Your father and I didn't
decide a thing.
You and Will and those quack
doctors did that for us.
That is the basis
of Hemingway's narrative.
James Joyce saw
the beauty of it.
Joyce acclaimed him,
called him a giant.
But not here. Not in America.
Here, we praise the hell out
of our brilliant darlings,
and then we kill them.
You tell dad to turn that jalopy
around and get right back home.
Try to understand. Just let me have
this vacation with your father.
"Vacation."
Now it's a vacation.
You know full well that dad
can't drive in his condition.
Your father's perfectly capable of driving.
He's doing very well.
Mom, please, at least
just keep the cell phone on.
Kids, we'll manage.
We love you.
- Where are they?
- I have no idea.
No idea, Lillian.
...that when we die,
who we are ends.
This is it.
That's all there is.
It's so beautifully crafted.
It's a work of poetry.
And it's prose.
Prose that is poetry.
No, yeah, I could
see that, definitely.
You can just ignore
him, you know.
Oh, no, it's super interesting.
He's being very nice.
Prose that is poetry
is Hemingway's secret.
Do you have any idea how
difficult that is to do?
For sure.
John, leave the
poor girl alone.
No, but it means, because
people have confused
his simplicity, his economy
of word, with banality.
- Have you read...
- You want any special sauces
- for your burger?
- No, no, we'll be fine.
- Thank you, Chantal. Thank you.
- Enjoy.
I just wanted to ask her if she'd
read The End of Something.
John, eat.
You want me to
cut it up for you?
No, not necessary.
Don't forget your pills.
Oh.
- How is it?
- Mmm.
And now yours.
I'm gonna chase mine
with this famous Happy Swirl.
I don't see how you
can just sit there eating.
We should call the police
and get Andy to track
their credit card spending.
Hopefully, mom hasn't lost
her marbles now as well.
Maybe they're just out for a short spin.
I mean, where are they gonna go?
The camper needs
to be serviced, Jane.
What if there's an accident?
What if someone sues dad?
We need to figure out where
they're going and intercept them.
And yet she continues to eat
as if it's nothing.
Everybody came to
my cousin's wedding.
They sat us at that great big
table next to the picture window.
Now, who was there?
Do you remember?
Me?
Yes, John.
You were there and I was
there and the kids were there.
Do you remember?
Oh, God.
Oh. Oh.
Oh, God.
We're fine.
John, that was amazing.
- I can still do it, can't I?
- Yes, you can.
Okay. Here, here.
Look. You take that road.
Ol' Route One.
We must have driven
that a thousand times.
We're heading south?
That's the plan.
To your people.
What people, John?
My parents are dead.
They're all dead?
I wonder what
it's like up there.
If it's a joyful place,
all singing and dancing
and Happy Swirls
all day long.
What do you think, John?
What it's like,
you know, after.

- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi. Welcome.
- We registered online.
Name is Spencer.
Come along, my darling.
Ah, perfect.
Perfect, perfect.
Good.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- Yeah. That's good.
- Thank you.
Watch your head.
Come on, guys.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Hello there.
Whoa.
Check it out.
'75 Winnebago Indian.
It's a gift from my parents.
I named it the
Leisure Seeker.
My husband hated it at first.
He thought it was
kind of low-class.
But he kind of got used to it.
We've had a lot of wonderful
trips in this old rust bucket.
Look at this old
beauty, babe.
- Look.
- Yeah, it's great.
So, have you folks been
on the road long?
No, we just started.
We're headed south
down to where I grew up between
Charleston and Savannah.
- Oh, it's so beautiful down there.
- It is. It's beautiful.
We'd always go
there on vacation,
but this time we're going further
south, all the way to the Florida Keys.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
I'm finally taking John to see
Hemingway's house in Key West.
You ever been there?
No, we haven't.
Hemingway was a Confederate
general, right?
No, silly, he was a writer.
Didn't he commit suicide?
He did.
And I never understood why.
John knows all about him. He's
always wanted to see that house.
Every year, I'd promise
him we'd go,
but you know how it is
traveling with little kids.
We've seen Melville's place.
That's near to where we live.
He's a writer, too, you know.
He wrote Moby Dick.
Very, very interesting.
Actually, it was a pain in the
rear for my son Will and me.
- But my daughter Jane, she loved it.
- Mom! Dad!
I think that's why
she became a professor.
My husband, John,
is so proud of her.
But my son Will,
on the other hand,
you know, he's still
struggling to find his way.
- He just doesn't know what he...
- Where are we?
- We're not home.
- No, hon. We live in Massachusetts.
This is Pennsylvania.
What the dickens are
we doing in Pennsylvania?
We're on vacation, and we're
having a whale of a time.
Yeah.
Not me. I want a cup of tea.
This is my husband John.
John, these are our neighbors.
- Hate to say it, but we...
- It's getting really late.
It's, uh... We gotta put
the kids to sleep.
- Bedtime stories.
- Maybe another time.
Good night. Say
goodbye, John.
I want a cup of tea.
Well...
I'll make your tea
when I'm good and ready.
I'm quite comfortable
sitting here.
I want it now.
You'll only be
up peeing all night.
- I want a cup of tea.
- Shh.
We're not the only ones here.
If you want a cup of tea,
you go and make it yourself.
You're not an invalid.
That is exactly
what I will do.
Hey, darling.
Would you like
a cup of tea?
I give up.
Drink that.
Into bed.
You coming?
In a minute.
Bye-bye.
Good morning,
Johnny, my love.
How are you, honey?
Goodness me.
It occurred to me this morning
that I should replace
the water filter.
So I did
and then I didn't.
I mean, the darned thing was as
clean as a whistle. It's amazing.
And once again, I
was compelled to admit
that this old contraption
isn't all bad.
I mean, of course there are infinitely
better means of transportation,
but there is no
denying that one gets
an exceptional sleep
on that stupid bed.
What about you, my princess? Do you
feel any peas under the mattress?
No.
I'm so happy when
you come back to me.
I was only just outside
the door, sweetheart.
- You have pain?
- No.
Good.
Where are we exactly?
Chester County, south
of Philadelphia.
- Chester County.
- Mmm-hmm.
One of Penn's
three counties.
I am so glad to be back
on the road again.
Let me make you
a cup of coffee.
John?
What's happening?
Where are we?
It's so nice when you
forget to be forgetful.
Too bad it ends so quickly.
I just can't get used to it.
What are you saying?
Nothing. I'll make the coffee.
You should get
dressed, my love.
- Come on, slowpoke.
- I'll go. I'll go.
How about we stop
at old Chesapeake?
The children used to love that,
and you didn't mind it so much.
Old what?
That, uh, historical
village in, in Virginia.
Maybe Dan isn't after all.
Hmm? What are
you talking about?
He's not dead, is he?
- Who?
- Dan.
Oh, my God.
You mean Daniel Coleman?
What is going on
in that mind of yours?
You're just like Gretta.
- Gretta?
- "Yes, the newspapers were right.
"Snow was general
all over Ireland.
"It was falling on every part
of the dark central plain."
All right, all
right. I get it.
The story by Melville.
Joyce. The beautiful
James Joyce.
I'm glad you can
at least remember something.
Gretta Conroy.
You're just like her.
You thought of
him your entire life.
What on Earth are
you talking about?
We'd go to Charleston
and you'd sneak
off to Savannah
saying you were
going to see your aunt.
I don't believe this.
I mean, if Daniel Coleman is
alive, and that's a big if,
he's been living in Daytona
for the past 30 years.
Daniel Coleman. Honestly.
Ella, where's my gun?
Uh, we... We didn't
bring the gun.
We didn't?
No. No, we definitely
did not bring the gun.
But we always do.
Fire.
Right face. March.
Two people, single day.
That'll be $88, ma'am.
Goodness, you've
become pricey.
It's $40.99 per
ticket, plus taxes.
When we used to come here with the kids,
it was $10 for the day.
When was this? Back
when we were a colony?
Oh, ha-ha. Very funny.
What an asshole.
Uh, enjoy your visit.
- Thank you.
- Welcome.
Did you call
him an asshole?
No, no. I just said,
"Ah, so..."
Let's go
see the library.
You used to love that.
Mr. Spencer?
Mr. Spencer.
It's me, Jennifer Ward,
class of '93.
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm, I'm sorry, miss.
- I'm afraid my husband...
- Jenny Ward?
It's you.
How the devil are you?
I'm so...
So happy to see you.
How did you do at Columbia?
Oh, you've graduated by now.
Oh, yeah. Gosh, I...
I can't believe
you remember me.
I can't believe it either.
A lot has happened since then.
Um, Michael, Emily, this
is Mr. Spencer.
The most inspiring
teacher I ever had.
- Hello, Mr. Spencer.
- Hi, Emily. Hi, Michael.
Well, what was the name
of that friend of yours?
Oh, uh, yeah. Uh,
Lauren Mitchell.
Lauren... That's
it. That's it.
The two of you, you were
always laughing and...
- Gosh.
- Yeah. Yeah, we were.
I'm sorry if I
disturbed you. I...
I'm just so happy to see you.
Oh, me too, Jenny.
Me too.
Bye, Michael. Bye, Emily.
Bye, Jenny.
"Me too, Jenny. Me too."
I mean, you can't remember
the names of your own kids,
but you do remember that
Jenny was always laughing.
I'm, I'm speechless.
I mean, what goes on
in that head of yours?
She was such a good student.
Oh, well, that
explains it all.
Hey, hon.
Did you know that Tennessee Williams
had a house in Key West, too?
Uh, wasn't he one of those
writers you really loved?
I think you took me
to see one of his plays.
John, you hear me?
Though I preferred the movie
with Marlon Brando.
God, he was gorgeous.
Ella, where are the kids?
They're at home.
At home?
We left the kids at
the house, on their own?
I don't believe it. What in
God's name have we done?
John, they're all grown up.
They're almost old. They'll be fine.
They've got their own lives.
- Seriously?
- Yes.
Jane is married to Phillip.
She teaches college. They've got
two kids, a boy and a girl.
- Really?
- Rosie and Stephen.
Rosie and Stephen.
They're toddlers, right?
And they're very cute.
Stephen's 19,
Rosie's 21.
Don't you remember we went
to her high school graduation?
Rosie made a wonderful speech
and Stephen played in the band.
You were very moved by it.
Stephen played in the band
and...
Rosie made a wonderful speech.
Oh, you do remember.
No, I don't.
It's so painful when you
don't remember anything.
I'm sick and tired of having to
remember everything for you.
Forgive me, Ella. Forgive me.
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
get angry with you.
- It's my damn memory.
- I know. I know.
I know.
Come on, come on.
I brought a surprise for you.
You brought a surprise for me?
There's something I
want us to do, okay?
- Us together?
- Together. Tonight.
- Tonight?
- Tonight.
I don't think I can.
- What?
- You can do this.
- Okay.
- I promise you.
All right.
So, what are you reading now?
- Oh, you're reading Ernest Hemingway.
- I can't read anything, dear.
Yeah, this is his
short stories, but...
I can't, you know...
- I start a sentence...
- Mmm-hmm.
...and by the time I get
to the end of it...
Mmm-hmm.
- I can't...
- You can't remember how it started.
Mmm-mmm.
I can remember
things I remember,
but I can't remember things I...
Yeah.
Oh, wow.
Now, which one is
this? Do you know?
- Jane.
- Yes.
So sweet.
Ah, now, where
are we in this one?
Oh, Ella, look at you.
I can't believe I'm married to
somebody as beautiful as you.
- Oh.
- It's the Chowan River.
Uh, now, who
are these people?
Down in Charleston,
your nephews and nieces. Yeah.
No.
- They're your students.
- Yeah?
They were throwing you
a birthday party. Look.
Oh, wow. Yeah.
- That was your favorite class.
- Yeah, that...
Yeah.
That's me, too.
- Who's that?
- Now, that was Nantucket.
And that was that nice boy
that Will met.
They got on like
a house afire.
Good pals. I wonder
what happened to him.
Mmm.
Oh.
- Darling. Darling.
- Mmm?
Wake up. Wake up.
Come on. Get up.
Just for a minute. Get up.
There you go.
It happened again.
Wait, wait. Let me
dry you off first.
- Go ahead.
- Here. You're all wet.
There.
- Easy.
- There.
Stupid briefs.
Look, I bought you
six new pairs of boxers.
- Why won't you wear them?
- I don't like 'em.
- Why?
- I don't like them.
Same old song I've
heard all my life.
What's so great about briefs?
Control.
Six, seven... Whoops.
Eight, nine, ten.
And arms up and down.
All the way up and breathe
and down.
You know what I
love about you, John?
Your silences are
never embarrassing.
Never once in my life
have I thought,
"I really need to
say something now."
So, you still see him?
Mmm?
What are you talking about?
You speak with
him on the phone.
You write him letters.
- Who?
- Dan.
You said he's living
in Daytona now.
Dan?
Not that again.
Susan Sullivan told us
at Maggie Tate's funeral.
You were standing there
right beside me.
You asked about him.
Uh, John, that was 10,
15 years ago.
All these lies.
All these years.
"How poor a part
he, her husband..."
- John. No, John.
- "...had played in her life."
- Get back here.
- Gretta Conway.
Can you believe this?
He's convinced I'm still thinking
about my first boyfriend,
who, by the way, dumped
me 50 years ago.
Mind you, Dan
was right to do so,
because it would never
have worked out between us.
Times were different then.
I was only 19.
Oh, that was
such a scandal.
What happened?
Well, they sent me to work at my
Aunt Rosemary's shop in Boston,
and it was there
that I met John.
He came into the shop,
this handsome young teacher.
He came in every week to buy
a pair of leather gloves.
He always said he'd
lost the last pair.
Eventually, I discovered he had
a whole house full of them.
He was the one for me.
And this first boyfriend?
- You didn't think about him anymore?
- No.
He vanished from my mind.
"If you can keep your head when
all about you are losing theirs
"and blaming it on you..."
- Hello?
- Hello, sweetheart.
Mother. Where are you? For God's
sake, tell me where you are
so we can come get
you immediately.
Now, listen, Will.
We were looking at family
slides last night,
and we were looking at photos
from our trip to Nantucket.
- Nantucket?
- Remember that?
- It was so beautiful.
- Oh, come on.
And you met that nice boy.
What was his name?
- Patrick.
- Patrick?
- Two of you were very close.
- Now, listen to me, Mom.
Jane and I are seriously thinking about
filing a missing persons report.
Anyway, I was wondering,
- are you happy in your new work?
- You're not listening.
You were such a
wonderful broker.
You could sell some
truly ugly houses.
Don't you change the subject.
Was it because you had an argument
with your business partner Richard?
You really need to come back
and resume your therapy.
- The two of you were so close.
- Mother.
- And I always wondered...
- It's crucial, Mother.
- Were you in a...
- How's Dad? Is he with you?
Oh, Will, come on.
- Talk to me, please.
- Is he taking his meds?
- Oh, God damn it!
- Mom?
Mother.
You're killing me.
John. John!
- Oh, God.
- Oh, snap.
Grandpa forgot his wife.
Oh, please, please,
help me, please.
Hey, come on. Hop aboard.
- Come on.
- On that?
Yeah, it's a piece of cake.
- How?
- All right.
- Come on, help her out.
- All right, I'll help you up.
- Here we go.
- Okay.
Great.
- Okay, go.
- All right. Here we go.
John!
- John.
- Ella.
Ella. What the hell are you
doing on a motorcycle?
They're dangerous,
for God's sakes.
I don't believe you.
On a motorcycle
without a helmet.
- And who was that guy?
- Go to hell.
Well, you'll be with me
in the handbasket, missus.
How you doing, darling?
- I mean it. Go to hell.
- What?
You left me behind.
- I did not.
- You left me alone.
I mean, I don't know where
you thought you were going,
you and your empty head.
Me, going somewhere without you?
You must be crazy.
- Let me do it, dear.
- No. What...
John.
That's dangerous.
Put your hands
back on the wheel.
John, you need to pull over.
- Why? You need to pee?
- The police are right behind us.
Now, let me do
the talking, okay?
I need to find out if that
fool son of ours
has snitched on us.
You just keep quiet.
Here he comes.
License and
registration, please.
Yes, Officer. Of course. Here.
I'm John Spencer.
Mr. Spencer, I pulled
you over 'cause I saw you
weaving in and out
of lanes back there.
Yes, Officer, it was
completely my fault.
I was trying to
open this bottle of...
Ma'am?
I'd prefer Mr. Spencer
to answer for himself, please.
Yes, Officer,
I was just trying
to help her open the thing.
"The thing"?
Yeah, the thing.
The, the, the bottle.
I'm gonna go run your license.
Stay put.
What are you, insane?
Don't even think about it.
Give me the keys.
Shh. Zip it.
He's coming back.
Just be polite. Do
not burp or fart.
Don't call him the fuzz.
What's going on, old-timer?
Thinking about running on me?
You two want to end up on "The
World's Slowest Police Chases"?
That's a
good one, Officer.
Stay in your lane.
- Respect the speed limits, okay?
- Thank you.
Absolutely, Officer.
Thank you so much.
- Have a good day.

Give me the key.
Damn fool policeman.

- My goodness.
- Who's that?
That's the littlest
one. The boy.
He's got a name,
John, and it's Will.
- Well, yeah. William.
- William.
Is that you?
I was pregnant then with Will.
Now, tell... Who's that woman
standing there next to me?
What is her name?
- She lived next door to us.
- That's right.
It's our neighbor.
- Lillian.
- Lillian.
Very good.
- Fantastic.
- Ma'am.
Would it bother you
if we watched as well?
Oh, sure, sure.
Come on in, guys.
Make yourselves comfortable.
Oh, thank you very much.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Here, John. Beer.
From the boys.
Why, thank you.
- Here we go.
- All right.
Wow.
That's my daughter.
Well, she's beautiful, sir.
- Oh.
- Oh.
And that's John's
birthday party.
John?
Those are his students.
They're always
around the house.
They would even come back
after they've graduated.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Where's Ella?
I'm here, John.
No.
No, Ella Carson.
She's my girl. She's 22.
Long blonde hair.
She's gorgeous.
- Is that really you, Ella?
- Of course it's me.
Who are you?
I'm me. John.
No, you're not.
My John is a young teacher.
He's charming.
Very handsome. Educated.
I want him back.
You stole him from me, and I
want you to give him back.
Oh, boy. If I could, I would.
Whoever stole him from you
stole him from me, too.
John?
One second.
Um, excuse me.
You haven't, by any chance,
seen my husband?
He's a tall,
distinguished-looking gentleman
with white hair and glasses.
Uh, yeah, guy like that passed
by here about a half hour ago.
He did? Where
was he going?
No idea, ma'am.
Then I'm afraid
I'm gonna need your help.
You see, my husband suffers
from memory loss,
and I'm afraid he might just
wander off and get hurt.
- I can't leave my post.
- Oh, my...
- What about your RV?
- No. I...
I can't handle
that. That's too big.
I... Oh, please.
I wouldn't ask you
if it wasn't so important.
Please.
Let me call my brother Terry.
It's my fault.
Gosh.
Hey. Hey, is that him?
That poor old fella?
No, I told you, my John is a
distinguished-looking gentleman.
He's got white hair, glasses
and a well-groomed beard.
I get it. Academic
from Yankee-land.
I like that type.
There he is. There he is!
That's him.
John! John!
Oh, thank God.
John!
John.
Oh, John.
- John.
- Why are you crying?
Because you weren't there,
and I wouldn't know
how to live without you.
Not for one minute.
Listen. Listen.
We must not be
separated, okay?
Do you understand?
Because we don't
have much time left.
Well, then it's a
good thing you came,
'cause you wouldn't
have wanted to miss this.
This is an extraordinary...
It's one hell of a
chocolate ice cream.
Can I get you an
ice cream, ma'am?
Yes, thank you.
No, no, get me a whiskey.
It was so cold, but
it was beautiful.
Everything was covered in
with a layer of ice.
It was all shiny
and transparent,
as if the whole world
was covered by glass.
I had to take little,
little teensy steps
to stop from slipping.
And I was very cold,
but you wanted to go on.
Because you were telling me
the story of White Fang.
And you were keeping
your voice low
so as not to disturb
the beautiful silence.
And we got home at
3:00 in the morning,
and our hair was
covered in frost.
And that was the
night we made Jane.
Jane.
What is it?
Mile marker 21.
Thank you.
It's okay, hon.
AAA will be here
- in about a half an hour.
- I can do it.
I don't need them.
I know you don't, but I don't
want you out here in the sun.
Come on. We're on vacation.
- You folks need a hand?
- Yeah, need anything?
No, we're fine, we're fine.
The AAA will be
here in just a minute.
How long you think it'll be
till they get here?
Oh, them?
A half hour if we're lucky.
- Well, good.
- That's what you said.
Look. All right,
just be cool.
We're gonna take all your
stuff, and then we'll go. Okay?
Give me the phone, lady.
That's a nice-ass
ring you got.
- Oh.
- Give it to me.
- No.
- Hey.
Not my ring. It's
my wedding ring.
Lady.
Where's your wallet at?
Never end a sentence
with a preposition.
The "at" is implied
when you say "where."
Oh!
There's no need to get upset just
because you don't know grammar.
- You can learn it.
- John, just do what they say.
Old lady, you shut your ass
up. Give me your purse.
It's in the camper.
Shall I get it?
Yeah. Hurry up.
It's huge. Win the
lottery or something?
It's got a picture
of my family in it,
and I would appreciate it
if you would not take that.
Just like eight bucks in here.
That's all she gives me.
Does she keep your balls, too? Good...
- Shit.
- Oh, shit.
Hey! Put down the gun,
or I hurt him bad.
If you hurt him,
I'll shoot you both,
and if you think we're afraid,
you're very wrong,
because we've got
nothing to lose.
So drop the knives,
you hooligans.
- Is that Will?
- Yes, ma'am.
He's always calling
at the wrong time.
I don't want to speak to him.
Just throw it on the ground.
Make sure the safety's off before you
start shooting them, sweetheart.
Already done it, hon.
Put the rings on the wallet.
Now, you get
along out of here.
I won't even call the cops
if you hurry up. Go on.
Your rings sucked
anyway, you old bag!
And your wallet's
full of bullshit.
You fellas should
consider evening classes.
Turn your life around.
- It's not too late.
- Hey, screw you, Pop!
Lucky we had the gun.
I thought we left it at home.
I thought we might need it.
Hon, would you get me
a Canadian from the fridge?
Yes, ma'am.
One Canadian coming up.
I'm sorry I couldn't
speak with Will.
I was held up.
We're really worried, Mother.
Will is getting desperate.
I'm going to see him now.
Oh, your brother's
a nervous nelly.
Your daddy and I are having
a fine old time.
- Where are you, Mom?
- Jane, you would not believe
how beautiful
it is right here.
You're not gonna tell
me. Okay, I get it.
- How's Dad?
- He's fine. He's full of beans.
You want to speak with him?
Hey, it's Jane.
She wants to speak with you.
- Who is it?
- It's your daughter. Take it.
Hi, pumpkin.
How are you?
You haven't called me that
since I was eight, Daddy.
You've been so much in my head
these days, little one.
Do you have any idea
how proud I am of you?
I bet you're making quite a
splash at that college of yours.
I mean, it's not for
nothing your name's Spencer.
Yes, Daddy.
Well, I love you, pumpkin.
We'll see you soon.
Jane. "Jane"?
Jane.
Mom.
I love you, too, darling.
Me too, Mom.
You make sure you
come home, okay?
Okay, darling.
Listen, kiss the kids
for me, will you?
And tell your brother
that we've spoken.
- Okay?
- I will...
- I will, Mom.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- Okay.
Hey, don't finish
all the Canadian.
Thank you.
A large one.
Perfect.
Leave them alone.
They're having fun.
Allow me to introduce Jane,
the all-knowing.
Watch her explain how it is to poor
Will because he doesn't know jack shit.
What the hell are
you talking about?
I'm just saying that there's
nothing we can do to stop them.
It's her right to
refuse treatment.
We both know how little
good it does anyway.
I know that it's better than
wandering around God-knows-where
in a creaky camper.
But you know best, I guess,
because you talked to Dad.
And you two are
thick as thieves.
Even when he doesn't
remember who you are.
I don't know why you are
making this so personal, Will.
Because you live two hours
away and phone once a week?
And come on weekends for
lunches that are cooked by me.
What do you know about...
What do you know about spending
long afternoons with Dad
when he doesn't say a single
thing that makes any sense?
Do you know what Mom says
when she gets sick,
and I have to run there
in the middle of the night?
Do you know what she says?
"Don't call Jane. She's busy."
You've been telling this story about how
I'm the favorite child for years, Will.
- It's bullshit.
- Maybe it is.
But it's the only
story I've got.
They're just doing what they've
done their whole lives.
Staying together,
the two of them.
There's so much love between
them, they forgot about us.
- Both of us.
- Oh, Will.
Get off.
You know what happened?
When was it? Last year.
I opened their bedroom door,
and you won't believe
what they were doing.
She was on the bed,
and he was,
he was kneeling
in front of her.
I can't even say it.
Dad was muff diving?
Yodeling in the canyon?
"Yodeling..."
- I wanted to vomit.
- Why?
I hope it happens to me
when I'm their age.
God, what a thought.
But I kind of doubt it.
For years with
Phillip and me,
it's been one quick
kiss and, "Good night."
Houston, we have a problem.
Well, just pull over.

Put the shotgun in my hand,

No, no, no. Let's
just go inside.

Oh, John!
John!
You'll have to get over here
- to help me get up.
- Give me your shoulders.
"Give me your shoulders"?
What do you mean?
- Get...
- Oh, God!
- God.
- Get off me!
- You're crushing me.
- I think I hurt my arm.
So what? Just get off.
Get off me. Get off me.

Uh, get up, get over

John?
Oh, I can't believe it.
John!
John!
Hey, are you crazy?
What are you trying to do?
Stone me to death?
- What are you doing?
- Well, your shoes have come off.
There.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
After all you've
done for me,
this is nothing.
Look at you. You're all dirty.
John, what's the big rush?
Oh, I could have done
with a little more sleep.
Oh, my God.
It's the moment
of truth, Ella.
For heaven's
sake, what's this?
Take me to him. Now.
- To who?
- "To whom"!
To Dan.
To Daniel Coleman.
I need to look him
straight in the eye.
Oh, for God's sake.
I'm not going to wait
for some snowy night
for you to finally confess everything
as you look out the window at
"the snow falling faintly
through the universe."
I am so sick and
tired of this nonsense.
He was always
there for you, Dan.
I've only ever
been second best.
How dare you
point a gun at me?
Take me to him.
You want to see Dan?
Fine. Fine.
What are you doing?
I'm going to find out
where Dan Coleman is,
even if he's in his grave,
and I'm gonna take you to him.
You will?
- Sullivan. Sullivan.
- Really?
- Hello.
- Susan?
It's me. Who's speaking?
You'll never guess
who this is.
You can't go in
there with a gun.
I'm going in as I see fit.
Fine. Fine.
A hundred cops will probably show
up and kill us both, but fine.
If that's what you want,
that's what you'll get.
May I help you?
Yes, we'd like to see
Daniel Coleman, please.
- Daniel Coleman?
- I believe he's a resident here.
- Are you on the list?
- We're just old friends.
We're just passing by.
- Wait one moment.
- You're very kind.
John, she said to wait.
- Is that you, Coleman?
- Who?
Daniel Coleman.
Who?
I'm so sorry.
I think we've got
the wrong room.
We're so sorry to disturb you.
Daniel Coleman. You know him?
- Which room is his?
- Who?
Finally, we find you.
I've always wanted to see
your face, Dan Coleman.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's not loaded.
- It isn't?
- But...
I'm not Dan.
Where's Daniel Coleman?
Hello, Dan.
That's him?
It's me.
- Me?
- It's Ella.
Ella Carson.
I don't know you.
Two strange white folks
walk into my room...
This is my husband,
John Spencer.
- Nice to meet you.
- I don't care.
John Spencer.
It don't make no
difference who he is.
Just get out of here.
- Do you wear boxers?
- What?
Do you wear boxers or briefs?
And this is what
you want to know?
I want to understand
where this fixation
with boxers comes from.
Fine. Fine.
Ask away.
Do you wear boxers or briefs?
I wear diapers, white boy.
Now, get on out of here.
Ella what?
You really don't remember me.
I don't want to remember
you. I don't know you.
Get the hell out
this goddamn place.
Shoot this son
of a bitch, John.
- But it's not loaded.
- Oh, my God, a gun.
- Guys?
- What are you doing?
- He doesn't remember my wife.
- Is everybody okay?
It's all right.
It's all right.
- It's not loaded.
- Guys, let's go.
You gotta go.
- He's an English teacher.
- Guys.
- He's not dangerous.
- Let's go. It's fine.
- Sir, you're gonna have to go.
- It's okay.
You're gonna have to go.
Just be grateful
we didn't call the police.
Oh, we are. We're
very grateful.
Thank you so much. You've
been very understanding.
We were thinking that perhaps the two
of you might need a little rest.
No offense intended.
This contains a list of all
the insurance we accept.
We'll call your children, so
they can come tour the facility.
Thank you. That's very
kind of you.
And the next time that you guys
want to come visit your friend,
do it without the gun, okay?
- Even if it is empty.
- Yes. Yes, of course.
Thank you so much.
- Goodbye.
- But are you sure
you want to be
traveling around on your own?
- It's nice here.
- We're fine.
Ask Dan.
Why are you so sad?
I'm just a little tired.
I'm also angry.
At you mostly.
But also at Dan.
Dan? Dan who?
Oh, for Christ's sake.
I know who Dan
is. I was joking.
Dan is the fella who isn't
in Savannah anymore.
He was black.
I mean, he is black.
He was a little more
charismatic at the time.
Wow.
Wow, wow, wow.
My Ella.
John, can we sleep
in a real bed tonight?
Now, once we get to the
event, there will be security there,
so in addition to your ticket,
everyone take a moment, make sure
you've got a photo ID with you.
We're still missing
a couple people,
so we're just gonna group up
in the lobby right here.
If you just want
to gather round...
- Hi.
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Good evening.
- How might I assist you?
Do you have a room available?
Economical. It's just
for one night.
We have a standard double
with twin beds.
No, no, no, we
can't be separated.
No.
Well, in that case,
we have the Lawrenceville,
a beautiful suite
with a king bed.
Oh, we'll take it. Thank you.
That normally goes
for $500 a night,
but I can let you have it
for $320 plus tax.
Goodness me, I don't
want to buy it.
I just want to spend
the night in it.
I've never spent that much on a
hotel room in my whole life.
The Lawrenceville it is.
Guillermo will show you.
Do you have any luggage?
There's the minibar,
some complimentary items, stereo,
and in here is the master bedroom.
This is bigger
than our house.
- Can we afford it?
- Don't be silly, John.
Of course we can afford it.
- Um, thank you so much.
- No, no, no.
It's okay. Thank you.
- Here are your keys.
- Oh, thank you.
Enjoy your stay.
Oh, Ella.
Oh, wow.
My gosh.
I'm gonna get us a drink.
I think we've earned it.
Excellent.
Oh, look.
Hang on.
Whoo!

- Did you sleep well?
- Oh, like a rock.
- So long since I've slept that well.
- Help me, will you?
Yeah, that's better.
Okay. See you later.
I'll be back at
the usual time.
Well, where are you going?
This is not home.
No, it's not.
- Where are we?
- We're in a lovely place.

Yes, I'm sure it does.
Oh...
Santiago is the perfect
Hemingway character
because he achieves
inner spiritual success,
which is, for Hemingway,
what defines true man.
He's defeated, but
he's not destroyed.
At the end of the story,
Hemingway observes the old man.
Sound asleep.
Skeleton of his great fish
still lies on the line.
And Hemingway writes...
Oh...
I've lost it.
Oh, God, and it's such
a beautiful phrase.
And I've forgotten
it. Oh, dear.
"The old man was
dreaming about lions."
Oh, my God, you
know it! You know it!
Oh, how wonderful.
Excuse me, where
are the teaspoons?
I wrote my honors thesis
- on The Old Man and the Sea.
- How wonderful. Oh, gosh.
I preferred the movie
with Spencer Tracy.
There's a quote of William
Faulkner where he says,
"Hemingway was one
of the bravest and the best."
And you can add for me
one of the purest.
I totally agree.
- Oh, gosh.
- Teaspoon?
Uh, so sorry.
Can you believe it?
- No.
- She wrote her honors thesis
- on The Old Man and the Sea.
- Wow, really?
Darling?
Mmm.
No, no, no, don't stop.
Let's just find
a campsite, okay?
Okay.
I'm so tired.
Um... If you're hungry, there's
some food in the fridge.
Mmm.
You still don't
feel right, Lillian?
Oh, don't fret, please.
I won't leave you on your own.
Lillian?
I'll go home when
you feel okay.
So,
where's Ella now?
Ella?
Ella's at home.
- At home.
- Mmm-hmm.
Yeah.
This baby's
taking its toll on her.
What am I thinking?
I should be
there to help her.
I really have
to go home now.
Wait, John.
Does...
Does Ella know about us?
You know she doesn't.
I couldn't bear it if she knew.
Neither could you.
It'd break her heart.
It'd break mine, too.
We have to stop this, Lillian.
Yes.
Yes, we do. We have to stop.
It's been going
on a long time.
Way too long.
So, how long is too long?
You don't remember?
Lillian.
It was nearly two years ago.
So,
do you love me?
What are you talking about?
You know it's not like that.
You said it yourself,
this is just between friends.
I mean, you're a wonderful
friend, Lillian, the best,
but I love Ella.
Ella's the love of my life.
She's everything to me,
and we've got a baby on
the way, for God's sake.
We have to stop this, Lillian.
I'm sorry, but
we have to end this
once and for all.
Goodbye, dear Lillian.
Goodbye.
You get back here,
you son of a bitch!
- You get back in here...
- Ella, what's happening?
...so I can kill you!
- Bastard!
- Ella, Ella, what's happening?
Oh! Oh, I'm Ella now,
am I? I'm Ella now.
- Ella, Ella, Ella, just stop!
- Yeah, I'm Ella now.
What are you doing?
- Oh!
- God.
Where's my phone?
Ella. Ella, what's going on?
Quiet, you fool.
This is the end of our trip.
- Hello? This is Station 37.
- What?
Could you send me a taxi
here, please, ASAP.
A taxi?
Shut up. Just shut up.
- Mother, where are you?
- Will, what do you want?
- Mother!
- Stop calling me.
I don't want
to talk to you.
Go on. Get out. Get out!
Ow!
- Come on.
- You guys call a cab?
Do you see any other
customers standing around?
Now, here's your stuff.
It's your nightshirt, your
socks, your damn briefs.
- What's happening, Ella?
- Just get in. Get in.
Would you mind helping me load
my husband and his stupid bag?
Yes, ma'am.
You just stay in there.
Why are you so mad?
I'm not mad.
I'm not mad.
No, I'm relieved.
Yeah, I'm happy as a clam.
Would you take us to the nearest
old people's home, please?
- The crummier, the better.
- Yes, ma'am.
- This isn't where we live.
- No, it isn't.
We're at a place where they
keep old fools like you.
- Ella, why are you so irritated?
- Sit down, please.
This is my husband John.
Um, give him a room, please.
Ma'am, we cannot
accept new patients
without following
established guidelines.
Establish them, then.
You can come tomorrow morning
at 9:30 to the intake office.
If the gentleman falls within
the required parameters,
he'll be put on the wait list,
which is about 10 months.
Well, that sounds more
like your problem than mine.
Now, here's
everything you need.
His social security, his
money, his driver's license.
Oh, and there's this.
This is very important.
This is a photograph
he cut out of a magazine.
He thinks this is us.
He thinks this is his family.
He carries it
around in his wallet.
See what I mean? That is
what you're dealing with.
Well, I'm tired,
and you have work to do.
So, he's all yours.
Goodbye, John.
Ma'am, you can't just...
Ma'am! Ma'am, you...
She must know
you can't stay here.
I mean, sometimes she's
a wounded buffalo.
I know that.
Are you familiar
with Hemingway's
The Short Happy Life
of Francis Macomber?
His wife shot him
in the back of the neck
with a Mannlicher 6.5.
What should we do?
Call the police?
I don't think they'd take him.
Oh, yeah, look at you, coming into my
house with your thighs all on display.
Slutty.
Look at that face.
Look at that face, you bitch!
Look at you cozying
up to my husband.
That's my husband, bitch.
All romantic.
Having a lovely afternoon.
What about me?
Having kids.
Pregnant. I was pregnant
with Will then.
I mean, I was pregnant.
Oh, yeah, right.
Supermodel, my ass.
You my friend?
Worst friend in the world.
Jane.
Oh, you knew.
Jane.
You knew, and you
never said a word.
Hey.
- Is it them?
- Yeah, it's Mom.
Hello.
Your father fooled me my whole
life, and you knew it.
Mom? What's happening?
- Where are you?
- You never said a word.
Always on his side.
Professor, my ass.
What's wrong? I'm at the
house with Phillip and Will.
We're all here waiting for you.
Where are you? Let us come get you.
I'm alone. I got
rid of your father.
And I'm coming back home, or
maybe I'm going to the beach.
- I don't know. I...
- Mom?
- Where's Dad?
- I never want to see him again.
I'm finally free of that horrible
creature who ruined my life.
- I don't give a damn about Hemingway...
- What the fuck?
...or Melville or those
- pedantic little lectures...
- Mom.
that you went on and on and on,
always made me feel like an idiot.
- Mom, you have to...
- He lived his whole life a lie.
It was all a lie. I mean, what
do you read in all those books?
- It's just lies.
- Mom, calm down and listen to me.
Where's Dad?
I think he's lying
about being senile now.
He's just an impostor.
You didn't leave
him alone, did you?
You never thought you'd have
a vindictive mother, did you?
You made me like this.
You. And him.
You just go to hell.
Where's my whiskey?
Jane, sweetheart.
I don't know what
came over me.
I think it must
have been my meds.
No, no, your daddy's fine.
I was only joking.
I would never abandon him.
Jane, Jane, listen, darling.
I want you to do me a favor.
A favor?
Listen, could you
go to Lillian,
- give her a message for me?
- Mom, Lillian is right here.
Tell her she's
the dirtiest whore on Earth.
- What did you say?
- No, in the universe.
The dirtiest whore
in the whole universe.
Thanks.
Where's my husband?
So, what's happening?
Nothing. Everything's fine.
- But where are they?
- I have no idea.
But Mom seems very energized.
She sends her love, Lillian.
Oh. So sweet.
Hi, darling.
Now I understand everything.
You won't remember this,
but you came home one night,
and I was cleaning
the kitchen floor.
I was all hot and sweaty
and stinky and...
I was seven months pregnant.
Ma'am, is everything all right?
Is there someone
we can call for you?
Can't you see I'm speaking
with my husband?
So you got down on the floor
with me to help me.
And then later on,
when I was taking a bath,
you got in the tub with me.
And I didn't know
anything, but I just...
I sensed that you...
That you returned to me.
And knowing nothing,
I forgave you.
This fella there,
he's a Bulls fan.
And Raymond Chandler
was a Bulls fan, too.
Hemingway liked bulls,
but they were in Spain.
You really should be going.
It's Mr. Davidson's bedtime.
Don't worry. I'm not leaving my husband
in this dump to be treated like a fool.
Come on, John.
Come on. We're leaving.
Pleasure to see you.
May I keep this?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- Here, dear.
- And now...
I have to forgive
you all over again.
- Forty-eight years later.
- Thank you, Ella.
I don't know if I'm a bitch
or you're a son of a bitch.
Well, I guess
anything's possible.
- John, pull over.
- Why?
I want to get down
and take a look.
I want a burger.
John, pull this camper
over immediately.
I want to get down
and take a look.
Yes, sir.
Oh, look, John.
It is so beautiful.
Are we there yet?
Almost.
Mmm.
Is this Heaven?
Maybe.
Do you think a guy can
get a burger up here?
What are you laughing at?
Hey, neighbors.
- You going to Hemingway House?
- Yes.
There's a great restaurant
right next door to it.
You're gonna love it.
- Really?
- Yep. I mean...
And the Hemingway House,
you won't believe it.
It's become like
the party town of all places.
My cousin, he got married
like three weeks ago there,
and we had the
time of our lives.
I mean, I got some
amazing pictures of it,
if you want to see.
On my camera and on my phone.
You could look at them
anywhere you want.
Well, you don't
want to see them?
They're really cool.
It was acquired by
the museum in 1974.
Before that when Hemingway and
his wife lived here, it was...
Folks, this is
Ernest Hemingway as he looked
while he was living down here in
Key West, Florida, late '30s.
Dark, swarthy,
very charismatic-looking man.
And also, folks,
in every single room...
Each cat has a
very particular feature.
They have six
claws, and this...
This is unbelievable.
Yeah.
Ella, it's a wedding.
Come on.
I'm so sorry. You always
wanted to come here.
Now look at it.
Excuse me. Where's
the bathroom?
I don't know.
Maybe try outside.
Thank you.
Oh, gosh.
You okay?
Call 911.
Is her husband
or family anywhere around?
No.
No, please don't...
No, don't take...
My husband John.
Don't take me, please.
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir?
I'm looking for...
Uh, looking for?
Help me, please.
Are you looking for
the bathroom?
It's out back, by
the souvenir shop.
Do you feel okay?
Thank you.
You've been very helpful.
Huh.
Yeah. I'm looking for my wife.
Sir?
My wife?
You'll have to check
with the desk inside.
That'll be $35, please.
Don't worry about it.
Hey, hey. Don't try
and pull that.
- You owe me 35 bucks.
- I do?
Yeah.
In order to figure out what
was causing these symptoms,
we did a full-body CAT scan.
We certainly weren't expecting
to find a situation
as grave as what we found.
The original tumor was in the
colon, wasn't it, Mr. Spencer?
Yes.
I'm John Spencer.
But now there's been
a blood-borne spread
through the lymphatic system,
attacking almost all internal organs.
To be honest with
you, Mr. Spencer,
it's amazing she's even alive with
her blood chemistry readings.
Were you really
taking an RV trip?
Where is my wife?
John.
How'd you get here?
I brought you something.
Oh, my bag.
Oh...
Hi, honey.
Could we have
some privacy, please?
Oh. Sorry.
- Put this on.
- What?
- Let's get out of here.
- No. No, John.
- Where are your shoes?
- Now they've got me,
they're not gonna let me go.
They're not going
to stop you, either.
Well, they're down
there somewhere.
Okay. I'm ready.
Which is the way out?
Exit?
Just around the corner.
You're almost there.
You're my hero.
John.
You're peeing.
We're in a taxi.
- I thought it felt warm.
- Just stop.
- It's that one over there.
- Yeah.
Thank you. Thank you
so much. Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
Home.
Mmm.
Mmm.
You need to change, John.
Here. Put your nightshirt on.
I lost all hope
in the hospital.
I thought I would never see
the Leisure Seeker again.
I think we both
need a good nap.
Here, darling.
Here, drink this.
Drink it all up.
Mmm.
Come here. You haven't even
washed yourself.
Come on.
Here.
Here we go.
Oh.
Hello, sweetheart.
Well done, but you can
stand down, soldier.
John, what are you doing?
- We'll try.
- Oh, no, no, no.
- No, just for a second.
- No, I don't think I can.
Just for a second.
Just for a second.
- I'm there.
- Yes.
You are.
You're all the way there.
Don't move.
- You don't want to come?
- No.
Just this.
Oh, John,
I love you so much.
Don't leave me again.
All right?
- All right.
- You promise?
Oh, I promise.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
My darling
Will and Jane.
Here's our lawyer's number.
I've taken care of everything,
all the arrangements.
There's nothing for you to
worry about,
although I think our final
Visa bill will be outrageous.
We had a little bit
of fun there at the end.
I'm so sorry to
hurt you like this.
I know how painful it must be.
But pretty soon you're going
to feel something else.
You're going to feel relief.
Relief that you don't have
to watch our bodies
and our minds fade away.
Relief that the burden we were becoming
has been lifted from your shoulders.
And you mustn't feel
guilty about that.
You mustn't.
I loved your father very much.
I didn't have much longer,
and I couldn't
leave him alone.
We were always together.
And I hope we're together
somewhere now.
Who knows?
This was our last
wonderful vacation.
We had some beautiful days.
It was our happy ending.
Love, Mom.
