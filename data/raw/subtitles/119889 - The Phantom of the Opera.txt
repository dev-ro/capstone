Have you done it ?
''And so by chance
a mysterious alliance was formed
between an abandoned baby
and the inhabitants of darkness''
I hope to enjoy myself tonight.
Your Excellency.
It was really kind of you.
Give me some slack !
That's enough !
Hurry, it's almost lunch time.
Aren't you tired of hanging there ?
What the helI's that ?
Marcel, pull me up ! Help !
- What's going on ?
- Help !
Help me ! Pull me up !
Quickly !
Oh, my God !
Help !
Ah !
Ah !
Who's there ?
Who's there ?
Is anyone there ?
Christine, where are you ?
I've looked for you everywhere !
We have to try your costume.
I'll be there in a second.
All right?
I beg your pardon ?
What for ?
- I thought you said something.
- No.
But I was thinking of you.
Thoughts that surprised me.
And I'm not easily surprised.
Why were you thinking of me ?
Your voice fills my heart
with divine light.
Who...
Listening to you is sublime.
This must be our secret.
Tell nobody.
- You'll know when we'll meet again.
- How ?
When you hear my thoughts,
you'll know where to go.
Yes, I can hear you.
Christine, Christine Daae.
Don't worry, I'll tell no-one.
Damn, it's freezing !
No !
No !
Ah !
Her beautiful eyes look so tired.
She's feverish.
She doesn't even talk to me.
You haven't been your usual self
these past few days.
Your head's always up in the clouds.
Don't tell me you're fretting because
of Carlotta ? She's jealous of you.
- I know.
- lf I was as ugly as she is...
..I would be jealous too.
Come in !
- They've sent roses.
- We can see that.
- They're for Miss Daae.
- Put them over there.
- I didn't think they were for me.
- Thank you, Kiki.
They're magnificent. You're lucky.
A bouquet like that costs a fortune.
It must be from a real admirer.
- They're from Baron Raoul de Chagny.
- The one who drools over you !
Don't say you're in love with him !
Where are you ?
What ?
Marc !
Thank you.
I know she hates me.
What should I do ?
This theatre is a real bordello.
It's scandalous !
Va fa'n gulo !
Yes, sir, I'll come at once.
That Degas is an incredible artist.
Yes, incredible.
Did you bring some sweets for
our charming little favourites ?
Of course !
Four pounds of Swiss chocolate.
- Good morning, may I come in ?
- Montluc, you'd come in...
..even if I said ''no''.
-Nothing escapes ''Coq Republicain''
- Or its greedy beak !
- Mr lgnace, you're the head...
..rat exterminator here at the Opera
House. Right ? - For 8 years now.
I've captured 4.837
of the dirty little beasts !
I keep all their tails
in jars of formaldehyde.
- You're very good at your job.
- The best !
They say somebody forced you to
stick your hand in a rat trap.
It wasn't somebody.
It was something !
What do you mean ?
I was like an invisible force.
A creature from hell !
Doctor, that hurts !
- Is that my thumb ?
- I'm afraid so.
Damn it !
You can see the bone !
Strange things have been happening
at the Paris Opera House.
The ''Coq Republicain'' is determined
to pursue its investigation.
- Do I frighten you ?
- No. I'm cold.
Your female smell
flows through my veins...
..like the melody
of the rolling ocean.
- Your scarf...
- Take it, it's yours.
Yes !
Christine, together
we shall do great things.
Soon, the whole world
will be at your feet.
Our lives will be a feast
of joy and happiness.
- Believe me.
- I believe you.
- Trust me.
- I trust you.
My sweet child ! My love !
- Did you get all the tools ?
- Yes.
Then give me the hammer.
Hey, listen !
- What are you doing here ?
- You know what ?
- I saw him !
- Who ?
- The Phantom !
- Have you been drinking ?
No. I saw him with my own eyes.
- Come on !
- I swear it !
I followed him. It was...
- What ?
- Amazing !
Amazing ? Well, go on !
Not here. Meet me after work.
I'm sure of one thing.
I'm a hero !
It isn't a legend,
my dear journalist.
But Phantoms don't exist,
here or elsewhere.
Elsewhere is none of my business,
but in the Opera House, he exists !
I have met him
right here, in this box !
- ln this box ?
- Yes.
It's being re-done now
and none of us like coming here.
- What's this Phantom like ? - l
haven't the courage to look at him.
- Of course.
- It's very cold when he arrives.
- Oh, really ?
- They say he loves the dark...
..and that he lived in the catacombs
even before the theatre was buiIt.
You know the Opera House
has four basement floors ?
They say there's even life
down there, a river and lakes !
Don't you find it
suddenly very cold ?
Come.
No Phantom's
going to scare your Alfred.
I fought with the Communards
in the Versailles uprising !
Are you sure he didn't see you ?
He can't have eyes
in the back of his head !
I tracked him like a leopard.
His hideout's deep in the catacombs.
I went through
a thousand galleries.
There are underground passages
leading through dark caverns.
When I think about it...
What ?
I made markings so that I could
get back, or I'd still be there.
Why did you take such a risk ?
- There's treasure down there.
- Treasure ?
Really ?
What else would someone hide
down there for ? Just think !
lf you made markings we could follow
them. The treasure's awaiting us !
- We deserve it.
- That's true.
We'll live like royaIty !
What ?
A chocolate ?
Who is that man
who sketches all the time ?
He's Degas, the artist.
He loves sketching
the dance school pupils.
Others prefer to give them sweets.
You like chocolates, don't you ?
Hallo.
Hallo.
I should be very angry with you,
Baron de Chagny.
- What have I done ?
- You know very well !
My only crime is to have met you.
How can I express with simple words
what I feel in my heart ?
Your flowers are wasted on me.
I've never liked roses.
You don't like roses ?
I prefer simpler flowers.
However, the language you used
in your letter...
It's difficuIt to explain
what I feIt when I read it.
For the first time, I feIt sure
that someone understood me.
I was as if
I'd just found a lost friend.
I would love to be your friend.
Will you allow me to be your friend ?
Raoul, I'll allow you to be
the brother I never had.
What if we come face to face
with the Phantom ?
I'll rip his guts out.
How are we going to
carry the treasure ?
We'll put it in my skirt !
Alfred !
- What's the matter ?
- I don't like being behind you.
All right, you go first.
- What does the Phantom look like ?
- He's not a real Phantom.
They're like ghosts, draped in
white sheets with holes for eyes.
- He's dressed in a black leather
cape. - Like a real gentleman !
- So he's not scary.
- No.
- I understand you're here to
steal my treasure. - No !
It was that bitch Paulette !
I admire you a lot, Mr Phantom.
I'm not a Phantom. I'm a rat !
Oh, I'm sorry. I love animals.
Alfred !
Alfred !
Where are you ?
Answer me !
Where are you ?
Alfred ! Alfred !
Alfred !
Ahhh !
The Phantom !
- What's the matter ?
- The Phantom !
The Phantom ?
Mr Buquet ! Why are you
frightening these poor children ?
I have to teach them
not to trust the Phantom.
Don't talk rubbish.
You shouldn't drink so much.
It was almost a year ago...
..when good old Gustave
and his two workers disappeared...
..without a trace !
They went too deeply into
the catacombs. That's his world.
Those who find it never come back.
He's on the prowl again.
He's here in the Opera House !
I saw him the other night
hiding behind some machinery.
He was hanging over the stage
like a spider !
- What was he doing ? - He was
listening to Christine singing.
Everyone else had already left.
She was alone on the stage and
she was singing like a nightingale.
Do you remember, Miss ?
I remember.
It was entrancing.
Not like Carlotta, who moos...
..like a drunken cow !
So you're the manager now. It's
only a question of changing places.
All I want to do is manage this place
the same great way as you have.
Is that why you and your
corrupt political friends...
..removed me from my post 6 months
before I was due to retire ?
Come in !
Pourdieu ! The thief's accomplice.
- I see you're pleased to see me !
- You're a rogue !
Come, Gentlemen, let's drink the
champagne of Republican brotherhood.
Nicolaud ! Nicolaud !
I've left you a present...
- What present ?
- The Phantom !
The Phantom of the Opera !
- He's dying !
- No, it's just a bout of malaria.
He'll be all right in a minute.
- He said something about a Phantom.
- I don't know what he meant.
A sore throat.
A raging, red sore throat.
It developed so quickly.
Ten minutes ago it was fine.
- Cancel the performance !
- Perhaps there's a solution.
Why not try the understudy.
She knows the role very well.
- Understudy ? Who is she ?
- Christine Daae.
She's very good.
The emotion was too much for her.
- She's so young.
- The Maestro asked too much of her.
He's too impetuous.
Take a breath, my dear child.
Breathe harder !
Breathe in !
Don't be afraid.
Everybody out now.
Everyone out, please !
I'm the doctor here, I believe !
It's not serious,
but you need peace and quiet.
- All right ? Try and get some sleep.
- Very well.
I'll be back tomorrow.
The cold makes me shiver.
You won't always be cold.
- You must be very tired.
- I sang for you.
I gave you my soul
and I almost died because of it.
The angels cried tonight.
I must be going crazy.
Jerome, what are you trying to
say about Christine ?
It's the talk of the town
that you're in love with her.
- Me in love ? Very funny !
- You laugh badly and lie even worse.
I'm just a friend. Nothing more.
Then have fun with her.
She's very charming.
Don't look at me like that,
little brother.
This evening I'll take you somewhere
strictly for the initiated.
I hope you can raise
your moral there.
Look !
Satan's Litanies ! You, the most
knowing and beautiful of angels.
God betrayed by fate,
have pity on my long suffering !
The Bateau lvre, sweeter to children
than the flesh of ripe apples.
The green water penetrates
my pinewood boat !
You arise ever stronger.
Without Rimbaud there would be
no redemption in poetry.
- Baudelaire is the greatest,
you degenerate fool ! - Rimbaud !
Christine ?
Christine !
- Is that you, Christine ?
- I'm not Christine.
I'm Rose. Rose ''Velvet Lips'' !
Get thee behind me, Satan !
Damn you ! I hate you all !
- Raoul !
- God will punish you !
You disgust me !
Raoul !
You're so pretty.
Have another chocolate.
It's Swiss chocolate.
No !
- It's from Geneva.
- I don't want it.
Eat it !
Help ! Leave me alone !
Wait, you naughty little girl.
Where are you, my little darling ?
Where are you ? Wait !
Where are you ?
Wait, my little dancer.
Here comes the big, bad wolf !
I just want to give you
some chocolate. I won't hurt you.
Here I am !
Where are you ?
You're so pretty !
So sweet !
Please be nice to me.
Please, little darling.
Be nice to me.
Shh !
Go home.
Lightly, lightly ! Like that !
Stop !
- Where have you been ?
- The Phantom ate Mr Poudieu !
Of course he did !
- Now tell us another one.
- It's true ! I saw him !
You're a naughty girl.
You mustn't tell lies.
Thirty-eight ! Yes !
With my machine,
we'll triple production.
Revenge !
I'll drag that beast from his lair...
..and tear him to pieces !
I didn't expect you so early,
sweetheart.
Why do you keep hiding that pipe ?
I know you smoke it.
I found you that perfumed
Dutch tobacco you like so much.
Oh, thank you !
- Can I have some coffee and a roll ?
- With butter and jam ?
- And some honey, please.
- Yes.
- I'm so hungry.
- Very well.
I'll go at once !
Is it possible that without
knowing anything about love...
..I've fallen in love
with two men at the same time ?
Christine !
Come to me !
- Come to me, Christine !
- Yes.
Sing, Christine !
Sing for me !
Yes !
My love ! My darling !
Where do you come from ?
I was abandoned at birth
on the river of time and space.
I was nourished and cared for
by creatures who have became...
..my friends, my brothers.
This is the reason
for my double nature...
..and why
I call this underworld my home.
Medusa's ring will always
lead you to my kingdom.
She disappeared
three or four hours ago.
- Disappeared ?
- Don't worry. She's just gone out.
- Where could she be ?
- Perhaps at a singing lesson.
Ah, yes, her singing lesson !
Do you really think so ?
Love's too pure to be embraced
by fears such as yours.
- Please tell her I called.
- Certainly.
Of course I'll tell her.
Tonight, you will sing ! The time
has come for you to replace Carlotta.
- There will be a big surprise at
the gala performance. - A surprise ?
Something to do with
the law of gravity...
..the law
of mutual attraction.
I must go, but you stay here.
I'll come back soon.
- No, I'm coming with you.
- Stay here !
- Do as I say !
- I'm coming too !
I don't want to stay here !
Where are you going ? Wait !
I hate you ! I hate this place !
My dear Carlotta,
I have magnificent news !
Magnificent news !
You won't believe it !
We have a full house !
We've had to turn people away.
It's incredible !
No, that's normal.
Who is singing ? Carlotta !
- Of course, it's you.
- Mr Poligny, excuse me.
- Have you next season's contract ?
- Yes, of course.
- Do you want it written in Italian ?
- Don't bother.
Marc, go and get the costumes.
I want to try them on.
You will not sing Romeo and Juliette.
- That ?
- Obey me or else, you fat cow !
How dare you speak to me like that !
Have you gone mad, Poligny ?
- But I didn't say anything !
- Do you think I'm deaf ?
You called me a fat cow !
- No I didn't !
- We'll discuss my contract later !
Get out, you lump of shit !
I hope you spit blood. Get out !
Carlotta !
Carlotta !
- Carlottina !
- Marc ?
- Marc !
- I'm here !
Marc !
- Carlotta !
- Marc !
Carlotta !
Even the dummy ! Damn it !
Marc ! Where are you ?
Marc !
Marc !
Come out !
Juliette ?
Francoise ?
Hilde !
You will not sing tonight
if you value these big breasts !
Mama !
- What happened ?
- Nothing.
- Nothing ?
- Nothing, Mama !
- Did you row over the new contract ?
- I will sing tonight !
I'll slay them all !
- Don't worry, it's a joke.
- A joke ?
Come along, don't worry about it.
You, come here.
Quickly !
It's really good, isn't it ?
May I ?
Help !
Help !
Let us through !
Where's the manager's office ?
Thank you.
About ten people have been killed
and there are many injured.
We received a threatening letter
but we thought it was a joke.
My predecessor did say that
there was a curse on the Opera House.
- Any news ? Have you seen her ?
- No.
- You must know something !
- I don't. Perhaps someone else does.
- Who ?
- Maybe someone who loves her more.
Come with me !
Hurry up !
- You're Juliette. The role is yours.
- I don't want it.
I don't want the role !
How many lives did it cost ?
You shall sing Juliette,
and I shall be there with you.
- I hate you !
- Love and hate are one.
You'll get used to me
and this way of life.
Do you want that fool
Raoul de Chagny ?
You deserve more than that.
- No !
- Yes.
Ahhh !
Christine !
My love !
- Never disappear like this again.
- Don't ever let me do it again.
This way.
- How did you find the way ?
- Honorine found it.
- We must go, he can see us here.
- Who do you mean ?
You don't understand.
You are my light.
- I'm full of darkness and impurity !
- No-one is pure.
We all have our dark corners,
you mustn't be afraid.
It's just human nature.
Believe me.
I want to see the sky.
Come.
Christine, where is he ?
Is he real ?
Or does he only exist in
that dark corner of your soul ?
Both.
His will is my will.
His thoughts are my actions.
Raoul, I need help.
I have no defence.
Our love is your defence,
it will deflect his thoughts.
The stronger our love,
the weaker he'll become.
One day, soon,
he'll be powerless.
Promise me you'll never let me go.
Yes, my love,
I promise I will never leave you.
My little nightingale !
Come, I knew you were here.
Where have you been ?
We were so worried !
You can tell us about it one day.
Come.
- Mastro Gounod wants to talk to you.
- You'll have your debut tonight.
- And Carlotta ?
- It would take six months to tell !
- Raoul...
- I promised, my love.
I know her.
She's Christine Daae.
She looks like a little virgin...
..but she's the Phantom's whore !
I saw her
down there in the catacombs...
..copulating with that murderer !
Death to them both !
Death to the monsters !
Christine !
Stop him !
Let me through.
- Stop him !
- Fantastic !
- But sir...
- Give me that !
- What happened ?
- I think it was the Phantom.
Somebody just stole my singer,
we must get her back !
Mine.
Mine.
Mine !
We shall live alone in my world of
darkness until death us do part.
Help, Raoul !
I'm here, hurry !
Help me !
- Christine !
- Where are you, Raoul ?
Christine !
- Help !
- Raoul.
Raoul.
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.
Forgive me, forgive me !
Come on, this way !
- Quick, he mustn't get away !
- This way.
This way, come on.
Christine !
Christine !
Oh, my God !
- I feel ill.
- It will be fine.
We have no time to rest.
It's not far now.
- Ah, the Baron with his gun !
- Move away from her !
Certainly !
Christine, life goes on.
We can't stay here.
They'll kill you if they catch you.
They're here !
We've found them.
Help her.
What are you waiting for ?
- Help her.
- No.
- Let's take her away.
- No !
Quickly, they're getting away !
Raoul, get into the boat
and take the oars.
Christine, you get in too.
They're down here, come quickly !
Sit down !
- Follow the cave to the river.
- No ! Why ?
Raoul, row faster !
No !
Stop !
Why ?
My world is finished
and so am l.
- No !
- Go towards the light.
Get those two in the boat as well !
No, no !
Don't let them get away !
No !
Stop !
Death to the monster !
My love !
My love !
No, no !
Christine !
Don't leave me !
