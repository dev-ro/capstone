It's 10:22. Anybody who doesn't have
their lights out in five minutes...
is gonna get their butt--
Now, get off the phone!
Get out of the shower!
Go, go, go.
Don't call back.
Just go to bed, man!
- Can't get enough of that stuff?
- Hey, man, life is chemistry.
Hey, give me half.
How come you drive an Alfa Romeo,
but you never have money?
In two days, I'll be eating
cheese fondue at Stowe anyway...
when I'm not cruisin' the slopes.
- You're not gonna let me study.
- No, not even a little.
Thank you.
Forget about Stowe, man.
In two days, I'm gonna be cruisin'
through the Caribbean with Lori.
Oh, yeah, right.
That's gonna be fun.
You'll be with her pain-in-the-ass
sister, mother and father...
who we all know thinks you're
a totally inferior human being.
- No, he doesn't. We're friends.
- Oh, yeah, right.
I hear him. “Dan, I can see right
through you, even if Lori can't.
You'll try and impress me,
then worm your way into my family.“
- I've already wormed my way in.
- Oh, Dan, you're so common.
Lori is a special kind of person,
and you're not.
- Mr. Cronenberg, are you hungry?
- Yeah.
Go crazy.
- Good evening, sir.
- Got a lot of studying to do?
Yeah.
Excuse me.
What are you doing?
Lori?
Hi, Danny.
- What are you doin' here?
- I came to see you.
Our school got out
two days early.
My parents think
I'm at Sarah Cavenaugh's.
This is not what I need. I've gotta
study here. I don't know this shit.
You can't do this to me.
You gotta go.
- When's the exam?
- It's tomorrow. You gotta go.
- I know all about this stuff.
- You do?
Yeah. Come on.
I'll quiz you.
- I've been worried about you.
- Why are you worried about me?
I don't know. I mean,
you're stuck here with 400 guys...
workin' yourself to death,
nobody being nice to you.
In two days, we'll be cruisin'
to the Caribbean.
Are you ready for the moon,
the stars, the surf?
Yeah.
I can have you back
by morning.
Back? Back from what?
Two tickets to
the Fabulous Thunderbirds.
Hey, forget it.
I'm sorry.
- I know it's a stupid idea.
- Well, come on.
The day after tomorrow we're
gonna be together for ten days.
All right. Willie Castner
gave 'em to me...
for helping him
with his ﬂoor exercises...
and I'm also sleeping with him.
That's very funny.
it's a very funny joke.
Me, I'm slaving over chemistry--
Willie Castner's a fag.
Shit, I hate this place.
It's just a lousy exam.
Tomorrow morning it'll all be over.
- Come on. I'll help you with this.
- Yeah, that's just what I need.
I need you to help me with this.
I'll never get any work done.
No, I'll be really quiet,
all right?
So what are you underlining now?
What are you doing?
This is everything
you should know, okay?
All right, you can stay.
Will you promise to be quiet?
I'll be quiet. I won't say a word.
You'll get an “A“ on this test.
- It's good to see you.
- Hey, no fooling around.
I'm the one on scholarship.
Come on.
Sorry.
You up for getting
some pizza?
No. Look, Lori, I know you thought
it was a hot idea coming here...
and I really appreciate that
you've gone to all this trouble--
- The truth is, I'm screwing you up.
- Yeah, sort of.
I didn't mean that, but this place
expects me to regurgitate this garbage.
It's not one long gym class like
that country club you call a school.
For your information,
I happen to have a shot a third...
in our half of the state,
and I'm goddamn proud of it.
Don't get pissed off, all right?
I just need this grade, okay?
My parents aren't rolling in bucks.
I can't switch schools like underwear.
Listen, Danny, I came down here
because I missed you.
I wanted to cheer you up.
I invited you on this vacation,
but you don't have to go.
Look, I wanna go, but I gotta study.
All you wanna do is go get pizza!
Okay, great! Study!
I hope you get a goddamn
one hundred, really.
I'll go for pizza and maybe I will
find out if Willie Castner is a fag.
Oh, that's very funny.
Lori, come on!
God!
It's a very easy test.
My 16-year-old daughter
could handle it.
Mr. Kowalski, you didn't even talk
about this first one.
I don't have to talk about it.
It's in the book.
You're supposed
to read the book.
From the smile on your face,
you must have done very well, Dan.
Remember that spring
is a time of change.
A lot of those questions had
the same answers, right?
- What do you mean?
- Like the seventies were all B's.
If I have to stay and take a makeup,
I'm gonna kill Kowalski.
- How'd you do on the essay question?
- Quiet, you two.
What essay question?
- I can't see him.
- Probably forgot we're coming.
- Bill, you promised.
- Maybe he chickened out.
- I'll only be a second.
- Okay, honey.
Danny, let's start from scratch.
I wasn't here the other night...
Willie Castner is a fag, and you're
seeing me for the first time.
Aren't you takin' this?
This is my favorite shirt.
Come on. We're gonna
have a great time.
We're gonna be makin' love
under the stars.
I can't go.
I ﬂunked chemistry.
I gotta stay and take a makeup.
- That's very funny, Danny.
- Yeah? Try 58.
You're serious?
I'm totally serious.
I'm gonna scream.
- I bet Dad could talk to somebody.
- No, don't tell your Dad.
Are you kidding me?
He's right downstairs.
Just tell him I got sick
and I got the stomach ﬂu.
- You want me to tell him?
- He's not gonna believe me.
They're gonna want to see you,
even if it's just to say good-bye.
I'm contagious.
Did you tell your mom?
I'll just stay and take
the makeup next week.
That's them.
This isn't fair.
- I'm not going.
- No, you have to go.
Your parents would really
come after me if I did that.
Come on. Probably would
have been dumb anyway...
me with your mom
and dad and Ginger.
- You really believe that?
- Yeah. No.
- This is my fault.
- How is it your fault?
I should be able to get
a 60 on anything.
I'm a jerk.
- I'm sorry. I feel like shit.
- That's all right.
I'll make this up to you though.
I promise.
- I really love you, you know.
- I love you too.
- Write me a postcard.
- Stop it.
- Have fun.
- Gotta go.
- Danny's not gonna make it.
- Why? What happened?
He's sick. Feels awful.
I think it's the ﬂu.
Maybe the trip will make him feel
better, honey. I'll go talk to him.
No, he's in really bad shape, Ma.
He doesn't want to see anybody.
Must have been
all the pressure of the exams.
I remember what that is.
When it's over, you just fall apart.
What a shame.
Is it the same ﬂu Ginger had?
- Is he puking? I did.
- Hi, Lori.
- Hello, Mr. Cronenberg.
- Hi, Mike.
Sure is a drag about Dan
ﬂunking his chemistry exam.
I'd love to take his place at the
makeup, but I gotta go to Stowe.
I'll see ya.
- Yeah, Dan's got a stomach problem.
- Daddy.
A lack of guts.
Can we please get out of here?
We're gonna miss the plane.
Come in.
Mr. Kowalski.
I was going to come
to your office, sir.
- I'm very disappointed in you, Dan.
- Yes, sir.
You're so bright,
and chemistry is so simple.
Action, reaction.
Yes, sir.
You did fine all semester.
What happened?
Let me guess.
You spent the last
forty-eight hours studying.
Ninety-six.
If you don't know it the night
before, you'll never know it.
I've heard that one before.
I just didn't trust myself.
How did this heart
get figured into your equation?
- I put that there?
- Well, I certainly didn't.
I guess I'm in love.
Love, the chemistry of life.
That's my girlfriend.
We were going to the Caribbean.
She reminds me
of my daughter.
Girls that pretty
don't like to be disappointed.
They want commitment.
Did you get
number 13 right, Dan?
You never put a number 13
on your tests. it's unlucky.
Well, I think in your case
it just might be lucky.
What about the formula
for caffeine?
Uh, C-8, H-10, N-4, 0-2?
You're late for a plane, boy.
Get the hell outta here.
Thank you, sir!
Everybody said you're a hard ass.
I knew you were a good guy.
I don't believe that for one second.
Thanks a lot, Mr. Kowalski.
Stop them!
Stop the cab! Yeah!
Row ten, seat
Don't you want to see
where you were conceived?
- On the plane?
- No, honey. Laguna Del Mar.
You started as a sparkle
in your Mom's margarita.
It really is a shame about Dan.
- Lori had her heart set on this.
- I didn't mean to criticize the boy...
but perhaps this incident
will give him a little backbone.
Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing, huh?
Sorry.
- Flight to Coradad, please.
- This is 121 domestic.
- You want 121 international.
- Yes. it's right around the corner.
Right around there.
Hello, is this Marina Towers?
Marina Towers?
Yeah? Okay.
I'd like to leave a message
for Lori Cronenberg. Is she there?
Oh, all right.
Well, then leave a message.
This is Dan Bartlett.
Just a minute,just a sec.
Bartlett, right.
For Lori Cronenberg,
with a Yes, right.
Tell her I'm in Porta Rosa,
and I'll be there ASAP.
Yes, I'm here in Porta Rosa,
and I'll be there ASAP. Right.
Just a sec. Okay, you got that?
Message for Cronenberg?
Okay, thanks.
It's all yours.
Taxi!
Can you take me to
the Marina Shores Hotel, please?
- Man, you just stole my ride!
- Terribly sorry.
Just watch out for the natives.
Bye-bye.
Thanks.
You crazy? You'll get hit!
Look at this, man!
Hey, are you guys from
the Marina Shores Hotel?
Your shirt, your shirt.
Hey, we're going that way, man.
We'll take you, if you like.
Cleon's gonna get us
a couple of jobs down there, man.
What?
Come on. We're not tryin' to steal
your bag. We're tryin' to help you!
- Come on, get in.
- Oh, no, no. I'll just get a taxi.
Taxi take you too long, man!
This Speed Racer here.
We'll get you there tout suite.
Come on!
- Get in the back.
- Well, I am in a rush.
- Jump in. We're growing old.
- Off we go, man!
- What's your name?
- Danny.
Thanks for the ride, you guys.
It's really beautiful around here.
So, Mr. Dan, this fine young woman,
she be Roxanne.
Cleon is driving.
Myself is Alphonso.
- How's it goin', Alphonso?
- Cool runnin', man.
- Cleon.
- Hey, man, you got any ludes, man?
Some good blow
maybe, huh, yeah?
You-- You guys are asking
the wrong guy. Sorry.
Best I can do is
cocktail nuts from the airplane.
Come on! You guys
always snorting in the States.
- We always hearing about it.
- Yeah!
No, no, no! You guys
are always snorting.
I thought- I thought
they grow it here, right?
Slow down! Slow down!
I want that one! Right there!
Hey!
Hey, man, come on!
I thought you meant
'cause I was stealing your woman.
All right, all right.
Shit, man, it's the roadblock.
Slow down, quick!
- What's the problem, Alphonso?
- Ganja, man!
What you doin', man?
Slow down, fool! Don't you see
it's the cops up there?
That whole bundle
is ganja?
What's happening?
What are you guys doing?
- I have to get to the Marina!
- A shortcut, man.
Look, if you guys are kidnapping me,
nobody's gonna pay a cent!
We show you the real
Porta Rosa this way!
None of that first-class
bullshit, man!
Cleon, pull over at the next
pay phone. I gotta call my girl...
tell her I'll be
a couple of months late.
Hey, is she blonde, man?
Come on! They all blonde
in the States. I know that.
And here I thought you
want me to stay with you.
What? You? That's not true.
Aren't you his girl?
Oh, no, man!
You got it all wrong, man!
Man belong to the woman
But the woman
she don't belong to the man
Hey, man belong to the woman
But the woman
she don't belong to the man
Hey, man belong to the woman
- What you doing?
- Wash the car now, man!
- You crazy?
- Ah, shit.
Man, you're crazy!
We'll never get her out!
Earth to Cleon!
So what's the plan, Cleon?
- Wash the car, man.
- Oh.
Come on, man, what do you say?
Let's go work on the car.
How long you guys just planning to sit here?
As long as it takes, man.
- This is fine shit!
- Here. Suck on this.
Man, not like this.
With the blade down
and then only half a ﬂip.
Not around and round.
- Hey! All right.
' Way to go, man!
- Ain't she a honey?
- Hey, come on, give me that!
Give me that! Look!
I don't think you guys understand.
I just wanna get to the Marina.
This has been a whole lot of fun,
and Roxanne is very beautiful.
It's been a fascinating
cultural experience...
but I've got a boat to catch!
And I'm sure
if we just try again...
we can get the car out,
so get up.
I gotta get to the Marina!
This Marina.
What Marina?
- The one on your stupid shirt!
- Oh, that Marina!
You sure you don't want
to suck on this?
Why not?
You guys planning on spending the
night here, in the middle of nowhere?
No, man,
we're not plannin' it.
We're just doin' it.
Go with the ﬂow.
- Hi.
- Is it going to work?
It'll work.
Got a lever here,
got a counterbalance.
That minibus, see,
the engine's not in the front.
It's in the back, right? So if
Pythagorean's Theory is correct...
we're gonna get this baby
out of the water.
We'll get it out in the morning.
Quit foolin' with it!
Does that brain of yours scare you
as much as it scares me?
- It must.
- I never thought about it that way.
Well, you should!
Roxanne, step away from this thing.
- It look dangerous.
- Good night, Mr. Determined.
Good night.
Man, he always want to be admired.
Woman, she want to beloved.
Fool. He'll put the jeep
on the moon.
Come on, come on, come on!
Hey, you all right, man?
Okay, we'll get it
in the morning.
Look, I want to thank you
very much.
- All the bags went on the boat?
- Everything. Yes, sir.
- Leave anything of mine?
- No. We took it all.
- Should I check for my hat in here?
- Hey!
Hey, honey, wait a minute!
Hey! Hey, honey,
where is that man of yours?
- Get in the car.
- Hey, where's that man of yours?
I don't want those people
near my daughter.
We just left him awhile ago.
We've been lookin' for him.
I won't bite.
just leave us, man.
He was with me all night. Hey, man,
we're not talkin' to you, man!
Come on!
No pun intended.
- Hey, Dan, you just missed she!
- What?
We'll catch her right now!
I'm not getting into
that deathtrap again!
Oh, Dan, that girl of yours is
truly a beauty, man! it's too bad!
Look, I'm not takin' any more shit
from you guys.
Well, I like that!
- Lori Cronenberg, please!
- I beg your pardon.
Cronenberg.
- I'm sorry. They've checked out.
- What?
No, they couldn't have checked out.
See, I left a message.
What is the name, sir?
Bartlett.
- Yes, sir. Dan Bartlett.
- I knew it!
Thank you.
This is my message!
Alphonso, Cleon, Roxanne, wait!
I was just kidding!
There she is, hon,
the Crystal Slipper
Captain Andrew, how are you?
This is my wife Buffy.
- Hello.
- My daughters, Ginger, Lori.
- My first mate, Chris.
- How are you? Hi.
You got your bathroom
and shower right here.
And this will be
your stateroom.
- This is great.
- Everything on this boat is the best.
Remember that.
- Where do you want it?
- On the bed's fine.
I'll bet it is.
- It's better than the pictures.
- Oh, I know. Excuse me.
Isn't that Chris
a nice-looking young man?
- You can kiss Porta Rosa good-bye.
- Yeah.
- Hey, wait!
- Hey, you guys!
- It's the same guys from the lobby.
- I don't believe it.
Lori, I know you're pretty,
but this is ridiculous.
Must be my perfume.
- Hey! Come back!
- Hey! Come back!
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!
Shit! Shit!
Come back!
No! Come back, Dan.
They're gone.
Come on.
Dan, come on.
- Hey, come back from there.
- Come on, Dan.
Come on!
- You can stay with us.
- We'll show you a good time.
Hey, Dan, Dan, no.
Come.
You never should have
left without us.
Don't worry about it now.
- Cheer up, huh?
- I should've listened to you guys.
- It's okay.
- You should have listened.
Look, man, it didn't
work out and things...
so maybe you want to
hang out here for a while.
No. I'm just gonna go down the beach
and get a couple of drinks.
Thank you, guys, but you go on.
I'll talk to you later, Cleon.
- Be cool runnin', man.
- Well, it's been real real, man.
Listen, next time you want to be
smart, you think with your heart.
I'll see you around.
Good-bye.
Good-bye,
Mr. Determined.
I'll see you guys later, right?
- Okay, Dan.
- You guys are all right.
Hey, what is with all this?
What is it with this?
Rum straight up, please.
I got sandals
older than you, kid.
Look.
That's as old
as I'm gonna get.
I just want a drink,
and then I'm gonna kill myself.
Yeah. Must've been
the glasses.
Help yourself.
It's a jungle
out there, man.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Hey, come on, you guys. Time to
start thinking about going home.
- School's out. I'm not going home.
- Yeah.
Maybe I'll just go with the ﬂow
for a couple of years.
Well, you won't be the first,
you won't be the last.
I'm looking for this guy.
Seen him?
Yeah. Signed on with that big yacht
that left this afternoon.
They were looking
for a new deckhand.
You remember
the name of the boat?
The Crystal Slipper?
- That's it.
- To the one that got away.
- You after him too, kid?
- Yeah.
My girl's on that boat.
They're headin' for Laguna Del Mar.
That means they'll be
island-hopping.
The usual stopover
in Arena Blanca.
- Why are you after the Crystal Slipper?
- The guy owes me.
You in love with this girl?
- In the worst way.
- Oh.
How would you like
to sail with me?
Name's MacClaren.
They call me Mac.
Names Dan, and they call me
Mr. Determined.
Okay then,
Mr. Determined.
You come with me.
You'll have the wind at your back.
We'll heel 'em over!
Take 'em by storm!
That's the way
to win a woman.
No, no, no.
I don't think so.
And I don't know
thing-one about boats.
- You read Treasure Island?
- Yeah.
I wrote a great
book report too.
You'll do.
What's happening?
We're at sea,
and I'm on a ship.
Boat, kid.
The Queen Mary's a ship.
Motorin' all night.
Caught the tide too.
We're lucky.
We don't hit any weather...
we're gonna catch them
by tomorrow.
- You said you wanted to join me.
- I did?
- I couldn't talk you out of it.
- Oh, man, did you try?
“Take 'em by storm,“
you said.
Hey, you were so anxious
to head out after them...
you didn't even give me time
to pick up the provisions.
Well, dinnertime.
That's enough for the fire.
If you can't stand the sight of
blood, stay out of the cabin.
- I'm gonna get sick.
- You gotta eat, and birds taste great.
- Are you cracked? We gotta go back!
- For Christ's sake!
You sound just like
my old lady.
Where is your old lady?
Coming around El Salvador,
she pulled a knife on me...
so I coldcocked her
with a frying pan.
People get pretty weird after
a while at sea, let me tell ya.
- Say, aren't those birds endangered?
- Yeah. They are now.
One of them is an imposter.
Isn't worth a shit.
I think he's half rooster.
Here, chickie!
Here, chickie!
Here, chickie, chickie,
chickie, chickie.
Here, chickie. Here, chickie.
What do you know?
Spaghetti-Os!
The hell with him.
Where'd he go?
Goddamn it.
I told you you'd see blood.
Blends right in
with the tomato sauce.
- Where's the bathroom?
- “The head,“ kid.
On a boat, you say “the head.“
Up front.
Bowsprit. That's where the mast
sticks out over the water.
- Where?
- It's called the ocean!
Don't forget
the first rule of sailing:
Never piss into the wind.
We're never gonna catch anybody
on this thing! We've gotta go back!
Forward, kid!
Ever forward! Come on!
- A perfect ten.
- I saw a jellyfish!
I hope you're not planning
on Lori saving you if you fall in.
Don't stay up too late, okay?
Good night, girls.
Good night, hon.
- Good night, Mom, Dad.
- Good night, Ginger.
See you in the morning, Chris.
Past your bedtime,
junior, isn't it?
Matter of fact, I usually stay up
and watch Cagney and Lacey
- Have it your way.
- That douche bag!
He is, isn't he?
He's got a gun in his cabin,
you know.
- You've been in his cabin?
- I've been in everybody's cabin.
It's humongous!
Let's go.
You should see all the weird stuff
he's got in his closet.
- Big knives and--
- Go to bed. I'll be in in a sec.
You know, I just started
on this boat.
My last one was this
incredible 68-footer.
We got boarded by
Haitians off Corida.
They murdered three people
and raped a girl.
It was intense, let me tell ya.
I went over the side.
They still haven't gotten the guys.
That's why I carry this.
Don't leave home
without it.
- I think I should be going now.
- Hey, hey, look.
We're hot for each other,
all right?
I mean, I could tell from
the minute you got on board.
Anybody who could put their
body in those positions...
has gotta be able to go
five ways while I'm going one.
Buffy, use the sunblock.
Look at your shoulders.
- I did use it!
- Oh, shit.
- What?
- The walls are so thin.
- What do you mean?
- I can't help it. I'm a screamer.
- You are?
- Once I get excited, I can't stop.
I had to stop staying over
at my boyfriends house.
I kept waking up the neighbors.
Lyell so loud,
he has to wear earplugs.
Oh, my love is like
a red, red rose
So newly sprung in June
Oh, my love is like a melody
That's sweetly played in tune
So fair in love
Am...
And I will love thee still, my dear
Till all the seas get dry
Are you armed...
with the wand of intuition?
No. You're stuck...
in some chauvinistic,
neural-imprinted tunnel of reality.
That's all they teach you
in fucking school.
- Soon, you'll be put to the test.
- I was. Two days ago. I ﬂunked.
No. I don't mean some gibberish
written on a piece of paper.
I mean something that shows
what you got inside.
What you're made of
down deep.
Here.
Some of us drink from
the fountain of knowledge.
Others gargle.
- Man, you cut up a temple!
- Hell, no. I made this myself.
You gotta come down here
for the right stone though.
Better than the real thing.
Intergalactic Rosetta Stone.
Yes.
It proves that aliens
brought life hereto Earth.
Someone is sure
gonna want this one.
Yeah, if they're nuts.
If they're nuts?
If they're nuts?
You're nuts. You're the one
who's stuck out here...
in the middle
of the ocean.
What if I did kill
my old lady?
What if I'm about to kill you?
Maybe I needed a deckhand...
and shanghaied you!
Relax, kid.
I'm just foolin' around.
Funny!
Thank you.
Here's to ya.
Hey, Mac! There they are!
See 'em? Right there!
- No, to the right, to the right!
- To the right, to the right!
- I thought you read Treasure Island
- You bet your ass!
That-- That's my woman
off the starboard bow! Come on!
- The wind's coming from that direction.
- You ought to know, Mr. Determined.
Go on, take the helm.
I'll get the sails up.
Oh, excellent! Cronenberg's
gonna be so impressed!
Yeah. Somebody's gonna be
mighty surprised to see me too.
- Why not call them on the radio?
- Only one thing.
- What?
- Radio took a bullet off of Rio Grande.
- Chris, that's enough.
- Yes, sir.
Just thought they'd like to see
our special transmitter.
It broadcasts the only truly
international language: lead.
Just shut it, okay, Chris?
Thanks.
Steer forward.
I don't want to alarm you,
but there have been boat hijackings.
I see.
Yeah, they grab the boat, use it
for drugs and kill all the people.
I saw it on cable.
Hey! Hey, they're
runnin' away from us!
Those jerks!
Goddamn!
Mac, what are we gonna do?
Daddy, I think I saw Danny!
He's on that boat!
Lori, if you think about that,
you'll realize how silly you sound.
But it looked like
it could have been him.
Honey, you could hardly
see the boat from here.
Small boat warnings are out.
That's why those guys are in a hurry.
- Well, what about us?
- Oh, we'll make to Marina Blanca.
- Gets a bit thick, we go on instruments.
- Wonderful.
Couldn't we just go back and check?
Maybe they need some help.
Lori, my first concern
is your safety.
Whoevef's handling that cutter knows
what they're doing, so don't worry.
Danny, take the tiller! I've got
to get some of this canvas down...
before the wind
picks up anymore.
- We're gonna lose them, you know!
- Forget about them!
You'd better think
about numero uno.
- Keep her pointed into the wind.
- Right.
It's not gonna get
any worse, is it, Mac?
Get real, kid!
We're heading into a hurricane!
Take hold of that line.
We're in real trouble,
aren't we, Mac?
All right!
I'll take it alone!
- We're gonna drown!
- Go below and get some rest!
I'll call you
in a couple of hours!
Grab ahold!
One hand for yourself,
one hand for the boat!
Whoever finds this note,
my name is Daniel Bartlett.
I'm caught in a hurricane off the coast
of Laguna Del Mar with a madman.
We're chasing the Crystal Slipper.
Tell my Mom and my Dad
that / love them.
To Lory, I love you always.
Danny.
Come on, you banshee!
Is that the best you can do?
Aw, shit!
Please, dear God!
Please, hold on!
Mac, hold on just a minute!
I'm coming!
Come on, you banshee!
Come on!
You wanna waste me?
I'll sail this boat
right through your black heart...
straight to hell and back!
Is that the best you can do?
That's dog shit! Come on!
We gotta be someplace
somewhere around here.
Someplace.
Mac, this is a place mat from some
lobster house. Look at this.
“This chart is not intended
for use in navigation.“
Come on, kid. Don't believe
everything you read, huh?
What we gotta do
is sail west!
We gotta hit land sometime.
That is...
unless you drift through the
Panama Canal and never notice it.
Kid...
you saved my life.
I pulled you in the boat,
that's all.
That's all?
Come on, now.
I'm thanking you.
I mean it.
I owe you one.
All right, thank you,
Marine Operator.
- Hi, sweetie.
- You missed a great time.
I wonder if the Coast Guard's
found anything.
Keep it up, Lori, and I swear
I'll have you institutionalized.
- She sounds sick.
- Don't worry, kid.
I call this engine Old Reliable.
It's got a little indigestion.
Jesus Christ!
Son of a bitch.
Damn it!
Hiya, folks!
How are ya?
Well, it looks like it's business
as usual here at Laguna Del Mar.
Here I am,
2,000 miles from Dallas...
trying to reach out
and touch somebody...
can't even use
the goddamn telephone!
- It's because of the storm.
- Yeah.
You came in
on that big job out there.
Sure is a beauty. How much
did that set you back, pal?
Oh, plenty, pal.
Oh, this is Carmelina.
Carmelina, conga! Conga!
Wow! I'm on
this new banana diet.
Strictly bananas. Only thing is,
it gives you a headache.
Now I know why monkeys do this
all the time: Ooh, ooh, ooh!
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- No, I'll take care of it.
Here ya are. Here.
Get yourself a green card. Wow.
- Mind if we join you?
- Well, actually--
- Actually, it's our anniversary.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
I bet you wonder where
all those years went.
- No, we know where they went.
- Enjoy yourself.
Why don't we get together later
for a drink or something?
Just come on over
and ask for Victor Honeywell.
Goddamn it.
Can't we just land?
Come on, kid.
I've been comin' out here
since white paint was cheap.
There's a port around here.
We'll hit it in a couple of days.
A couple of days?
That's it. That's it.
I'm getting off the boat.
Come on, kid, trust me. I haven't
steered you wrong so far, have I?
Trust you? Trust you?
You wanna know what I think?
I think you did shanghai me.
“Take 'em by storm“?
I never said any of that bullshit.
Come on, admit it! Did I?
All right! But I had
a goddamn good reason!
Yeah! You didn't want to be
alone on this deathtrap!
Yeah, that too!
I'm getting off.
This is too ridiculous!
I thought you said you wanted
to catch the Crystal Slipper
We're not gonna catch
anybody in this boat!
I'm supposed to be on some tropical
island paradise, eatin' lavish spreads...
not on some rat-infested
hellhole...
with some unscrupulous,
buccaneer rogue type!
You listen, you dirty
son of a bitch!
I didn't wanna scare ya
your first time at sea!
Your friends on the Crystal Slipper
are gonna be in a lot of trouble!
- You better stick with me!
- You're telling me...
I should be worried about the people
on the Crystal Slipper?
You'll say anything
to keep me on this boat!
What are you,
freakin' crazy?
At this rate, we'll be dead
long before we can catch them!
- Now look what you did!
- What I did?
If I wasn't
arguing with you...
we wouldn't have hit
the goddamn reef!
That's it!
I'm gettin' off right now!
You're making a big mistake!
What? What?
No, no, no, wait, wait!
No. Dan Bartlett.
I've come on the ship.
Many bad waves!
Shit.
Wouldn't listen to me,
Mr. Determined.
- Vamos!
- For what?
What's happening?
I can explain! I can explain!
That wasn't my stuff, all right?
Do you understand
Do you comprende?
Just let-- Can I say one--
Sir, are you listening to me?
Sir, just let me say
one thing, please!
That stuff you got
off the boat's not mine!
Come on!
You're gonna get six years.
You're gonna get six years!
No, I've got to get to Laguna
Del Mar tonight, all right?
Look, that's not my stuff,
all right? That's not my junk.
Do you have a captain? Does
anybody speak English in this dump?
Tell this guy...
that that isn't
my stuff, all right?
I came in on a boat,
and it's not my junk.
I said I speak English,
not Spanish.
All right,
let's get down to business.
Huh? I knew we could talk.
Damn it!
So what else is gonna
happen to me, huh?
Nothing. You're gonna sit
in this jail for six years.
And she helped me and my mom out
a lot when my parents split up.
Sometimes we go
jogging together.
Not so much, though, since I went
away to a school senior year.
Did I tell you guys we went all last
year when I was at Wilmington High?
Those were the times. Cruising
in the jeep, swimming in the falls.
Her father would kill me
if he knew I was here.
Hey, no offense, guys, but I'm
not supposed to be in jail.
He knew I'd
wind up like this.
She loves nature.
We must have driven down and parked
on every country road in this state.
Every one.
Lori's got an excellent
sense of humor.
I mean, she'll do anything.
- Anything?
- Almost anything.
What's her ass like?
Hands off.
You're gettin'
out of here, kid.
- The shit-holds comin' apart.
- Oh, great.
Meet you outside.
- Wait!
- What the hell are you doing?
Come on!
Come on, Danny!
Get in here!
- Thanks, Mac.
- I warned ya.
- I know that. Thank you.
- Should have stuck with me.
Fire away!
it's your jeep!
- Is there a seat belt in here, Mac?
- That's next year's model.
- Small children!
- I see 'em.
- What's the plan here?
- Juevos are on the fire, kid.
Best defense,
good offense.
What?
What are you doing?
I owed you one. But we're
even now, kid, right? Right!
You did okay.
The other side of that field
is the Valle Verde airstrip.
- Hop a plane to Laguna Del Mar.
- They'll be looking for us.
- They'll be busy chasing the jeep.
- What about you?
Don't worry about me.
If my hunch is right...
those friends of yours on the
Crystal Slipper really need you.
- You weren't bullshitting before?
- Hell, no.
That guy Chris helped
hijack my boat last year.
I don't know if he's working crew
or he wants to pull the same stunt.
But if I were you,
I'd get my ass down there, okay?
I wish I could go with you, but I
have to keep these guys off of us.
So I'll see you
in hell, brother.
- Do you speak English?
- Oh, yes, sir. Can I help you?
I gotta get to Laguna Del Mar. Can I
charge the fare against this ticket?
If you give it to me, I will
be most happy to do it for you.
Your ticket is fine.
But the noon ﬂight is all full.
I can put you on my standby.
I may have an opening.
I will also make a reservation
for you on the next ﬂight, okay?
- Please. When is the next ﬂight?
- One week from today.
One week? I've gotta get to see
my girlfriends family tonight.
- It's may importante.
- Oh, dear, it is Easter for us.
I think it is also
Easter for you, yes?
Excuse me.
- Maybe something will happen.
- I'll be waiting over here.
She wanted to have her baby
in Laguna Del Mar. Take it.
I'm so glad we could
give you what you needed.
- Hurry. The plane is leaving.
- Congratulations.
Quick. Go. Hurry.
Go, go, go!
I am so happy to have
the chance to service you.
Sorry.
First time in a week
I got a break.
Good, huh?
Pina colada.
Look, what was that
all about?
We're going to Vista Del Iago
instead of Laguna Del Mar.
What?
Vista Del Iago? Why?
- It's democracy.
- No, it isn't.
- I gotta talk to the pilot.
- No, you cannot talk to the pilot.
- Look what you started.
- Buddy, let's see what we can do.
Bomb?
No way,Jose!
Just sit down and shut up!
Listen, doughboy.
We're not going
to Vista Del Iago either, get me?
We're going--
We're going...
to Laguna Del Mar!
That's democracy. I'd like
a pina colada now. Move it.
Lori, you're not
even dressed yet.
Mom and Dad find out,
you're gonna be dust.
I can't take
this shit anymore.
- I'm gonna go call Danny.
- But the lines are still down.
I can call from the boat
on the radio.
Captain Andrew?
Hello? it's Lori.
Hey, hey, hey.
What's wrong, honey?
Someone killed our captain.
My God, he's dead.
- Oh, Buffy.
- Daddy, Captain Andrews dead.
- What? What?
- I found him on the boat.
It's true.
- Honey.
- All right, everybody just be cool.
- All we want is the boat.
- I don't care what you want.
- Don't point that gun at my family.
- You're missing what's going on.
This is my big goddamn score
and you stuck your fat asses in it.
Come in.
Perfect timing.
Victor, thank God you're here.
This guys killed the captain.
Kid, you're not gonna believe
what's gonna happen to you.
You're screwed. You've messed
with the wrong people this time.
Chris, you said they weren't
gonna go near the goddamn boat.
Now we got
a big goddamn mess.
I'm looking for the Cronenberg's.
Can you ring their room, please?
- Who?
- Cronenberg's.
- House phone.
- House phone works good.
We can't take them through
the crowd out there at gunpoint.
What? Why not? I'll stick
the gun in the little girl's back.
- They won't try anything.
- Haven't you learned anything?
When 30 people see us running away
with the Cronenberg's...
who the hell do you think
they're gonna come after?
Who's that?
Oh, it's our neighbors
from next door.
They're coming over
to have dinner with us.
If I don't answer,
they'll come over right away.
Then they're dead meat too.
Maybe your friends
are in the fiesta.
- The fiesta by the sea.
- Thank you.
All right,
you're packing your things.
You're leaving.
You don't like it here.
My family's worth more than
some boat. How much do you want?
- What, take a personal check?
- All right, put that down.
- Rico.
- Sir?
Carmelina. Help them get
their stuff packed.
- You like it?
- Yeah.
- You can have it.
- Really? Thanks.
Lori!
I swear to God, if you touch
any of my family again...
- I'll kill you, you son of a bitch.
- Back off, Billy boy.
Hey, get that stuff packed.
Get another jeep
and bring it around the back.
Chris, you, Tommy Ray and
Carmelina go out to the boat.
If anyone sees you, you're the crew
showing the boat to some customers.
Rico and I will meet you at the
pickup. Tommy Ray knows where it is.
You guys should get there first,
if you don't screw it up!
Why don't you just drop us
on the beach somewhere?
Smart girl. I bet you
get all A's in class.
Keep going.
I said keep going now.
You and the girl
in the first car.
All right,
let's get started.
All right, move it.
Move it!
Would you pull the line up?
We've gotta get out of here.
Where's the rum on this ship?
I need a drink.
Come on. Don't start
drinking this shit.
Your father is dumping that whole
family at sea. It makes me sick.
The Cronenberg's are assholes anyway.
Will you forget them?
I'll find a bottle myself.
Is this all that is left
of the captain?
He's in the closet.
Come on, Chris.
Let's have some fun.
- I'm tired of your old father.
- Forget it.
It's that girl, isn't it?
That tight-assed little rich girl.
- Shut up.
- She'll never screw you.
- Hey, maybe she already has.
- She can't do what I can.
You're just my old man's little
whore. That's all you're good for.
I'm the captain now.
Remember that.
Six feet...
five, five.
That's close enough.
The tide must be coming in.
Here.
Take one of these.
Goddamn! Listen
to me, all right?
I don't wanna kill anybody. I don't
even know who you are. Get up.
Move. Move!
What's the trick
to the machine gun?
You shove it up your ass
and pull the trigger.
After what I've been through,
you don't wanna piss me off.
Just tell me how it works.
You got your magazine,
pull the bolt.
If anything happens to the
Cronenberg's, I'm gonna come back...
I'm gonna shove a grenade
down your throat.
Aw, shit,
you're the boyfriend.
That's right.
Get up. Get up!
All right,
get in the fish locker.
You're starting to stink.
Hello. Hello. I don't know
if anyone can hear us.
This is the boat
the Crystal Slipper
We're about an hour west
of Laguna Del Mar.
The captain has been murdered.
They're trying to kill us.
I repeat-- They're trying
to kill us. Send somebody out here.
Daddy, if we get on that
boat again, it's all over.
It'll be all right, honey.
We just have to stick together.
Victor, just dump them in the jungle
and sail away just like that.
What the hell is she doing here?
She should be on the goddamn boat.
Jeez. Come on.
Get 'em to load that stuff.
Oh, my God, Danny.
It's a miracle.
Well, only if we can get out
of here. Are you all right?
Yeah. We gotta
get help now.
This is all the help
we're gonna get.
Carmelina,
where's that other girl?
All right,
we blow up that boat.
As they check it out, we get your
family and haul ass out of here.
Shit! I'll never make it
back up in time.
I only got a couple of seconds
after I pull the pin.
What if we throw from
the top of the house?
- How am I gonna get up there?
- The way I got in your lab.
Give me this.
Straight ahead.
Through the door.
Where's Lori?
- What the hell was that?
- I'll put a firecracker up his ass.
Why don't you just calm down?
We'll move the damn boxes. Let's go.
Where's that girl?
I want all this stuff moved out.
Everybody go down to the beach.
Pick up a bundle
and move it down to the beach.
I want you to get them
to move their asses!
That means you, Billy boy,
and that means you, miss.
Victor, just leave them here
and sail away.
Leave them here and sail away? I
can't leave them here and sail away!
And where's that girl?
What the hell--
Tommy, you come with me.
Rico, you watch them!
Holy shit!
- Dan!
- I've got a jeep outside, sir.
If we all leave now, we won't
get shot. Okay, let's go.
Come on!
Move it! Move it!
Let's go.
Get down!
Bill.
Bill, here's another clip.
I'll tell you how it works.
Dan, I was shitting in a hole
in Korea before you were born.
Oh.
Look out!
Get out. Everybody get out
of the car. Get out of the car.
Go down that road. it'll take you
to the beach and the boat.
- Danny, what are you doing?
- It'll work. They'll follow me. Go!
- No, Danny. I wanna go with you.
- Later.
Thanks, Dan. Come on.
Best defense.
Best defense.
I can't believe after
all we've been through...
- we've got to go back to school.
- It's true.
It looks like we're
almost out of here, thank God.
Dan, I just want you to know, from
now on you're part of this family.
- And we're damn lucky to have you.
- Thanks.
That's a pretty boat out there.
She's brand-new, up for charter.
Buffy and I were thinking how we
could show our appreciation to you.
I decided,
if you want to, that is--
you two cruise up the coast for
a couple of days, meet us in Cabo.
- No? Bill!
- I chartered that boat for you.
And I found
the perfect skipper.
I met this fellow in the bar.
He and I were in the war together.
Danny,
you will love him.
I just got filled in on your
accomplishments, young man.
And you too, young lady.
Captain MacClaren knew
all about those people.
- They've pirated boats for years.
- That's right.
That bunch got started
with my boat.
All I can say is, well...
it'll be my pleasure
to give them a great cruise.
Usually, I stick
to the big yachts.
But in this case, it would be
an honor. And don't worry, Bill.
I'll make sure that everything
stays above board.
What did you say
your name was? Don?
- Danny.
- Danny.
Danny, why don't you
and Lori get your gear?
If we hurry, we can make
the afternoon tide.
You think you can sail
this boat, kid?
I read Treasure Island,
right?
You'll do.
- Mac!
- Ever forward!
