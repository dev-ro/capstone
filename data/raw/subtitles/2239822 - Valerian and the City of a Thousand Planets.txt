The Alpha Intergalactic
Space Station
has reached
critical mass in orbit.
Its weight and size now pose
a serious threat to Mother Earth.
In its great wisdom,
the Central Committee
has decided to use all
resources necessary to release
the space station
from the Earth's gravity.
Its new course is set
for the Magellan current.
Like the great explorer Magellan,
The Alpha Station will journey
into the unknown.
A symbol of our
values and knowledge,
it will carry a message
of peace and unity
to the farthest reaches
of the universe.
Our thoughts and prayers
go with you.
God speed
and good luck.
[Planet Mül, Constellation QN34]
Good morning.
Ah..
Stay here.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Let's proceed.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
 - Good morning.
 Good morning.
Hopefully this will give us all happiness.
Take this to the storage space.
What is that?
Fast shelter!
Come on, quickly!
- What happened?
- There are objects falling from the sky.
Oh my goodness...
Secure all people,
bring them to a safe place.
Come on, quickly.
Wait.
Dolark!
They are coming.
Quickly, take cover!
- Wait...
- Come on!
- All gather!
- Come on!
- Faster!
- Faster!
Come on, quickly!
- Come on.
Hold everything!
Aksha!
No!
I'm sorry.
- No!
- Please.
No!
Goodbye.
You okay?
Yeah, just a...
bad dream.
No.
But I feel better now.
Don't you think we should
run through our assignment?
That's the last thing
I feel like doing.
Not very professional, Major.
Look, I scored a perfect 200
on my last memory test.
Impressive.
Unfortunately, you've forgotten
something rather important today.
What's that?
My birthday.
Hey!
What can I do
to make it up to you?
Beginning descent
in three minutes.
Nothing that you can get done
in three minutes.
Come on.
Don't start
what you can't finish.
Landing on planet Kyrian
in five minutes.
Sorry. Hey, look.
I know you're attracted to me.
Why deny the obvious?
- It's obvious?
- Yeah, sure.
Little goody two-shoes
with an Ivy League education
are always attracted to
galaxy-hopping bad boys like me.
My Ivy League education
taught me
to steer clear from
bad boys like you.
Yeah, well, you're not
gonna find better than me
on the market. Straight up.
Take a good look.
Handsome, intelligent,
- Modest.
- Brave.
- Suicidal.
- Determined.
- Pig-headed.
- Faithful.
To yourself.
Yeah, and to you.
You're my partner.
Yeah, don't forget it.
Look...
Why don't you think
with your heart
and not your head for once?
I don't wanna be another name
on your list of conquests.
Thank you very much.
What are you talking about?
What list?
Alex, can we see
the playlist, please?
No, no.
No, no, no, hey.
Most of those are coworkers,
and that's it.
Coworkers.
Right.
Where's my picture, then?
They mean nothing to me.
Okay? I took a few detours
when I was younger.
Your last detour was
not so long ago.
Yeah, but with you, it's different.
And you know it.
I want my heart to belong
to you and no one else.
My heart will belong to a man
who'll erase his playlist for me.
That's what I'm talking about.
I'm that man.
Look, we both know
you're quite a lady killer.
So, why do you lose
interest in a girl
as soon as you win her heart?
'Cause I'm looking
for the perfect woman.
But you've never
stopped to look.
That's not a crime.
No, it's not a crime.
But just admit it.
You're scared of commitment.
Me?
Scared of commitment?
Are you kidding me?
Nine years in the service.
Impeccable record.
Seven medals of honor.
- Never lost a partner.
- Yeah, until now.
Refuel complete.
Alex, did you enter
the coordinates?
I took that liberty.
So you could both enjoy
the beach a while longer.
Oh, thank you.
You are welcome.
You will be leaving exospace
in 30 seconds.
- You wanna take us down?
- Yes, sir.
Alex, will you pull my brain
charge for the last 10 minutes?
I had a weird dream.
See anything abnormal?
Your cerebral activity is
a little more intense than usual.
You received external waves.
Explain.
These waves don't come
from your memory.
Somebody is sending
you the images.
Do you know who?
Where they come from?
Negative. They could come
from the present or past.
And from anywhere
in the universe.
Leaving exospace.
Three, two, one. Exit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, easy.
- We're late.
- Yeah, well, better late than dead.
- You wanna drive?
- Whoa.
Put-put your hand back
on the joystick.
Laureline, put your hands
back on the joystick.
Laureline, will you please put
your hand back on the joystick?
Will you stop complaining
about my driving?
Yes, I'm sorry.
You're a great driver.
You're the best driver
in the entire universe.
Aw, thank you.
- Intercom activated.
- Thanks.
Touchdown on Kyrian
in two minutes.
Minister online.
- Sir.
- Agents Valerian and Laureline.
I trust you studied
the assignment.
So as soon as you land, recover
the converter and bring it to Alpha
for a top secret operation.
The converter is the
last creature of its species.
- So we're counting on you.
- Yes, sir.
Captain Gibson has further details.
And please, put on some
more appropriate clothing.
Good idea.
Leaving manual.
Manual disarmed.
Intercom activated.
Here they come.
Intruder 980.
Check parameters.
Two people on board.
No parasites.
Where's the band?
You plan on going on the
mission dressed like that?
We're supposed to mingle
with tourists, aren't we?
What do you expect us to wear?
Panda suit?
Nice hat.
Major, this mission is
in-and-out.
You enter Big Market,
you find the suspect's store,
and you team up with
Sergeant Cooper.
I only work with my partner.
- Hi.
- We're a team.
Sergeant Laureline will arrive
at the drop in exactly 20 minutes.
You will have 10 seconds
to make the transfer.
Didn't you read the memo?
Yeah... of course.
You better have.
How about we look at the memo
one last time?
It can't hurt.
You think you can survive
20 minutes without me?
How could I possibly?
Go on.
Be careful.
Oh, uh, you must be right,
I...
completely forgot.
I have a question for you.
Shoot.
What?
Will you marry me?
Not funny.
Laureline, I'm serious.
I've been thinkin' about
what you said earlier.
And you're right. I need
to move onward and upward.
I need to commit.
Here?
Just like that?
Yeah, why not? They sell
a zillion things here.
I'm sure we could find a priest
who'd be happy to oblige.
Go.
Okay, let's go.
We remind you that
if you want to enjoy
the experience of Big Market,
you must put on the equipment
available to you.
Thank you.
Welcome, everybody!
Welcome.
Please, gather round.
Gather round.
Now, my name is
Thaziit,
and I am your guide
for today, okay.
Now, whose first time
is this at Big Market?
Okay, lovely, lovely.
Wonderful, wonderful.
Now, let me remind you that
Big Market is
in another dimension.
You won't be able to see it
without your helmet
or touch it
without your gloves.
But there are really
a million stores in Big Market.
Yes, okay, ah
we have one hour.
Now, please, watch the
letters at the top
and verify that the U for human
is full green, okay?
So everybody, please,
get together
right behind your guide
whose name is?
- Thaziit!
- Thaziit, come on, let's go!
Follow me, please.
Put your helmets on.
Go through the gate.
Okay.
Activate your system.
Wonderful.
Do not leave with your helmet.
System activated.
Whoa!
Welcome...
to Big Market!
Hi!
Yeah, sure, of course.
Bill?
Can I have my camera, please?
Thank you.
Say cheese.
Thank you, Bill.
- You're good.
- Thanks.
Hey.
♪ Come with me ♪
♪ Stand by me ♪
Good luck.
♪ Dance with.. ♪
- What the hell are you doing, soldier?
- Sorry, sir.
- Keep an eye on the guy, right?
- Yes, sir.
Please be careful down the stairs.
Come on, everyone!
- Just think, baby, a million stores!
- Yeah.
Only stuff that we can carry, okay?
- I promise.
- All right.
All right, drop in 12 minutes.
Copy that.
I found the suspect's store.
Good. Sergeant Cooper will help you
get in and recover the stolen property.
Major Valerian.
Sergeant Cooper.
As you read in the memo,
you need glasses
to see the other dimension.
and a transmitter box
to bring anything there.
Especially a gun.
Authorized.
Put this on.
Enter your genetic code
on the front keypad.
To come back, enter your genetic
code on the back keypad.
- Clear?
- Crystal.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Hey, Tsûuri!
Good to see you again.
Please sit down.
- Do you have what we asked for?
- Yeah, yeah.
But it was a toughie.
I lost a lot of personnel
getting this for you.
But this... thing is priceless.
What can you give me
in exchange?
Amazing.
I never thought I'd see one
in my lifetime.
You'll have hundreds of them.
Just as soon as you give us
what we came for.
Aw, that's where I have
a slight problem, my friends.
If you're gonna knock out
copies of this baby for me,
Why shouldn't I do it for myself?
Hey, easy, my little lambs.
We absolutely need this converter.
You know we are fighting
for a noble cause.
I know. And I'm fighting
for a noble cause too.
Mine.
You have ten seconds
to drop your guns.
Hmm?
Show time.
Five...
Four...
Three...
Two...
One...
Ooop.
Federal Agent Valerian.
Sorry to interrupt this great deal,
but I'm also here for a noble cause.
It's called the law.
Hey, haven't I seen you guys
somewhere before?
Hey, I'm not runnin'
a tea room here.
What do you want from me?
Igon Siruss, you stand accused
of stealing a Mül converter
belonging to the Federation.
Before I drag your ass in,
I have to recover the stolen property.
- All right, how we doing?
- Almost there.
Valerian, I'll be to your left
at three o'clock, three meters away.
Got you.
Guys.
Don't move.
Now, take it nice and easy,
and push it into the box.
- Converter in the box.
- Copy.
Undetected.
Back to base.
- Good job.
- Copy that.
- Valerian, get out of here.
- I'm on my way.
I'll find you,
Federal Agent Valerian.
Wherever you are in the universe.
I'll find you.
And I will kill you.
- Good luck.
- Hmm.
Valerian's in trouble.
Mission takes priority.
Keep going.
- Cooper, cover him.
- Copy that.
Seek and destroy.
Top priority.
Target's photograph
to follow.
Valerian, how we doing?
Good. I think I lost 'em.
- Are you thirsty?
- No, thank you.
I'm to your left, 200 feet away.
My keypad's broken.
No, thank you.
Box is broken.
Can't get my arm back.
Hey, do you need a lawyer?
Federal Agent on duty.
Leave me alone.
- Oh, no.
- Oh yeah.
Valerian, what are you doing?
Da!
Very funny.
What's your name?
- Da.
- Da?
Come here. Come here.
Try this.
It's way more fun.
Da!
So long.
Da! Da! Da! Da!
Yeah, yeah, there's a time
for everything, kid.
Don't you have homework to do?
All right, go get yourself
cleaned up. Run to mommy.
- Mommy?
- Da.
Watch out!
Sorry!
To retrieve your purchases,
please place your items
in the transmitter box
and enter your DNA code.
Thank you.
Amazing.
And so practical.
Useless, you mean.
You don't even know
what you'll do with the darn thing.
Don't be such a grouch.
It's decorative.
Try to be civilized for once.
Civilized.
Yeah, sure.
Sorry!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, thanks a lot!
Sorry!
I didn't see the wall.
Need some help?
I just need you
to fix my arm, thanks.
I suppose since
you asked for my hand,
you should probably
get yours back first.
Is that a yes?
Don't move.
How can I help you
if you keep moving?
Will you just
hurry up, please?
Please keep still.
Been detected.
Uh...
Sorry to bother you.
I'm out of ammo and there's
three headed my way.
Give me one second.
I don't have a second.
- Okay, you're good.
- Thanks.
I don't know what
I'd do without you.
To retrieve you purchases,
please place your items
in the transmitter box
and enter your DNA code.
Thank you.
Fetch.
You've been detected.
Keep moving.
Don't change course.
What are we supposed to do?
Run.
- Zito, cover them.
- Yes, sir!
Get in!
- Come on, let's go, go!
- I'm comin', I'm comin'!
Zito, get that thing
off our backs.
I got it.
Guys, take it out,
take it out!
Alex, we need you right now.
Let's go.
Shoot, you ruined my dress.
Alex, I'm gonna
take over on manual.
Prepare to enter exospace.
You know the coordinates
for the rendezvous?
Yeah, I'm just set...
Alex, what was that?
We have a stowaway.
Oh, great.
Hold on.
Major Valerian, you're running
nearly 20 minutes late.
Yeah, well, time flies
when you're havin' fun.
- We have the Mül converter.
- Excellent.
Now, perhaps you can tell me
what you're doing 17 light-years
from your rendezvous?
Yeah, it sounds pretty grim
when you put it like that.
But when you say we'll
be there in... nine minutes
Does that sound better?
I'll inform the commander
that you're behind schedule.
and pass on your apology.
Yeah, you do that.
Leaving exospace in five seconds.
Somebody's gonna
land with a bang.
Okay.
Let's have a look at you.
Not at me, tiger.
Come on.
Don't be scared.
I'll look after you.
Come on.
Hello.
Wow! You have the most
incredible eyes.
Okay, you're a little scabby,
so, why don't we get you
a nice treatment,
so you can get your mojo back?
Sound good?
Come on.
Some high-grade uranium,
and you'll be good as new.
Hang on, tiger.
Alex.
Analyze this, please.
Power: 20 megatons?
Indeed. There's ten times
more power in that pearl
than in our entire ship.
Where does it come from?
From Mül, a planet that was
in the constellation QN34.
- Was?
- Yes.
The planet no longer exists.
And hasn't for 30 years.
Let's see what it looked like.
Abundant vegetation.
A few primal species,
but of no particular interest.
The one in my dream was pretty...
interesting.
Zoom in.
User access codes.
I'm afraid
that won't be enough, Major.
Access is restricted.
- To what rank?
- General.
Five stars.
The creature in my dream,
she had a pearl
just like that on her neck.
Noted, Major.
Leaving exospace in one minute.
He's very cute, you know.
And a real charmer.
You may have some competition.
I'm fine with competition.
Hey, I'm still waitin'
for your answer.
I know I can be
full of myself sometimes.
But I'm dead serious
about my proposal.
We have to complete
the mission, Major.
There's still the top secret
part to attend to.
Or is your perfect memory
failing you again?
Seat belt.
You know what?
I'm gonna ask for
ten days leave right now
and I'm gonna take you
to the most beautiful beach
in the whole universe.
A real beach this time.
The perfect place
for a honeymoon.
Ten seconds.
The honeymoon comes
after the wedding.
You know that, right?
- Really?
- Yup.
Three, two, one.
Decelerating.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Alex, what are you doin'?
Sorry.
Too much traffic.
Do you want me to drive?
Nope! No, no, no,
thank you.
Welcome to Alpha,
the City of a Thousand Planets.
Alex, can you update us?
I'd be delighted to.
The Alpha Station has grown
7% this year.
And since it left the
terrestrial orbit,
it has travelled almost
700 million miles.
- Population?
- Almost 30 million.
3,236 species
from the four corners of the
universe live on board.
Pooling their knowledge
and cultures.
Over 5,000 languages spoken.
Not counting the various
computer languages.
Demographics?
To the south
are the submerged parts
with 800 species living
in all kinds of liquids.
Such as the peaceful
Poulong Farmers
who grow cobalt.
To the north,
we have gaseous lands
dominated by the Azin Mö
whose extreme sensitivity
makes them specialists
in neurosciences
and molecular components.
They can build cells of any kind.
To the east of them,
the large colony of Omelites.
They control information technology,
finance, and banking.
Finally, to the west,
in a pressurized atmosphere,
we have nine million humans
and compatible species.
Home sweet home.
The economy has been
in shambles for a year.
Do you want a quick summary?
No. That's enough
excitement for one day.
Intruder XB982,
authorization to dock on Section One.
- VIP access.
- Oh, we're famous.
You're late, Major.
Sorry, sir. Things had been more
complicated than we expected.
Prepare for the worst
and you won't be disappointed.
And neither will I.
I'll keep that in mind,
Sir.
And you, have you
checked the converter?
He's in great shape.
May I ask what's going on?
Follow me.
Declassify.
A year ago, we discovered
a radioactive zone
right in the middle
of the station.
No signal of any kind
can get through it.
We sent several probes,
none came back.
So, we sent in a special unit.
Its mission was to get as
close to the zone as possible.
And to find the nature of the threat.
And?
No one came back alive.
Any idea who attacked them?
No.
This is the situation today.
The air in the zone
is unbreathable.
Highly contaminated.
And it continues to grow.
Like a tumor.
A tumor we have to cut out
as soon as we can.
If we don't and the
cancer keeps spreading,
it will destroy Alpha
in less than a week.
Commander, who would have
any reason to destroy Alpha?
Practically every living species
is represented here.
This is a weapon
of mass destruction.
And behind every weapon,
there is a killer.
It doesn't matter who it is.
It's a threat to us all.
It must be eliminated.
Through here.
- Commander.
- Minister.
The Council has given
you the green light.
But we strongly recommend
that international law
and the civil rights of all
concerned should be respected.
Of course. I shall
see to it personally.
Agents Valerian and Laureline
will be responsible
for your personal protection.
Sir, that won't be necessary.
I have a unit of K-Tron that are
personally trained...
It's a direct order from the
government, Commander.
The two agents need to report on
the outcome of the operations.
As you wish.
Gentlemen, lady,
good luck.
Since we have to be
on the same team,
You mind giving us an update
on the operation?
I'll be speaking to the Security
Council in a few minutes.
You'll have all the details
you need to know.
This is gonna be a lot of fun.
Hey, handsome. You're
looking a lot better.
You know, I remember learning
about you guys at school.
I'm dying to find out
if what they say is true.
Wow.
I need to take you
shopping with me.
Wait for me here.
- Anything?
- Not yet.
We haven't got
a peep out of him.
But I'm trying something new.
One more hour.
If he hasn't talked,
finish him off.
Yes, sir.
If anything goes wrong
with this operation,
you know what
you have to do.
Wow.
Looks like you're taking
my protection very seriously.
His protection, actually.
He's one of a kind.
You sure he needs to come along
in such a dangerous mission?
The Mül converter is
capable of reproducing
any conceivable product
in record time.
It will come in very handy
if we have to negotiate.
You have the K-Trons
on your command
I'm surprised
negotiating's on the table.
You take care
of my security, Major.
I'll take care of
any negotiations.
Give it to me.
I don't think that's
a very good idea.
For your personal security,
why don't you let
Agent Laureline look after
the little guy
for safe keeping?
I don't think so, Major.
It's against protocol.
I am the highest-ranking...
That animal is the last
living specimen of its species.
The whole universe is after it.
That's why Major Valerian
would rather I held on to it.
All right.
Just don't leave my sight.
Commander, the Council is waiting.
Okay.
Let's do this.
Stay here.
En route to the meeting.
Received, General.
You stay on back up.
I'll take the front line.
Yes, sir!
Delegates, thank you for
answering the call so quickly.
As the elective representative
of the Human Federation,
I have called this meeting
of the Alpha Security Council
to update you regarding
the state of emergency
we find ourselves in.
As you all know,
The heart of historic
Alpha Station
has been contaminated
by a force whose power
we do not know the origins of.
The Human Federation
has launched
several small military attacks
in order to ascertain
the severity of the threat.
But these have all
ended in failure.
And with some significant
losses among our troops.
In light of this alarming
and growing threat to us all,
the Human Federation is seeking...
Everything okay?
You're missing out.
I'm having a lot of fun.
Yeah, don't worry,
we'll be on the beach soon.
I can now answer some
questions you may have
about the details
of the operation.
13th battalion,
Special Assaults Division.
Ooh, there she is!
- I told you she's there.
- Yoohoo!
- Ugh, that's all I need.
- Agent Laureline!
- What?
- Doghan Daguis.
Oh.
- Nice to see you again.
- Agent Laureline.
Splendid as ever.
Just tell me what you want.
- We go where work calls.
- We speak over 5,000 languages.
- Which can be handy.
- In a party like this.
Need our services?
I have my own
personal translator.
Now, move.
Ask them if they have
Intel on Mül.
Planet Mül, ring any bells?
- A highly sensitive matter.
- Best person to speak to.
Would be Major Samk.
Alex?
Major Samk died a year ago.
- Well, yes, a most curious demise.
- That was not fully explained.
Murder, some might call it.
Major Samk was an expert
on Planet Mül.
He took all that
precious information.
- To the grave with him.
- What a waste.
If you receive any Intel
on this planet, we're interested.
It would be a pleasure to
work for you, Laureline.
- Mmhmm.
- Before we go,
We would like to give you.
- Some info.
- For free.
- For free?
- Mmhmm.
You guys must be sick.
- The converter is precious.
- And highly sought after.
- Mercenaries will come.
- To retrieve it.
Sooner than you think.
What kind of mercenaries?
- The first tip was free.
- You must pay for more.
You get a discount, of course.
General,
we have an alert on section B.
Alex, what's that?
A dozen individuals approaching.
What kind of individuals?
Undetectable for now.
It appears your info
just lost its value.
Now get out of my face.
Move, pigeons.
She just called us pigeons.
- What's a pigeon?
- I don't know.
Where are they coming from?
Everywhere. They're
going through the walls.
Alex, I need to know
the attackers' identity.
Everyone, please evacuate.
- I cannot read their DNA.
- What?
Sir,
The door's locked.
We can't get out.
- Laureline.
- I'm coming.
- Evacuate the Commander.
- Copy that.
General,
secure that door.
Commander.
What's going on?
- We need to evacuate.
- Let's go.
- It's not working.
- What?
Alex, open the door.
- What was that?
- The Pearls.
They took the Commander.
Here, take this.
Free the General.
Go to the command room
and track 'em from there.
Okay.
- Are we back to full power?
- Yes, sir, just now.
Everybody,
back to your posts!
Status on Major Valerian.
Level five emergency.
Confirmed.
Valerian,
I've got you on visual.
Okay, but I've lost track of 'em.
Try to locate the Commander.
Okay, I've got him.
He's near the docking bay,
so he must be headed
towards the vessel.
Okay. What's the
shortest way there?
North-northeast,
113 degrees.
60... 70... 80... 90...
That leads me
straight into a wall.
You said you wanted
the shortest way.
It may be the shortest way,
but it's not the easiest.
Keep going.
You're almost there.
They've reached another ship.
No tags.
Unknown model.
Valerian, they've boarded.
Change of plan.
140 degrees east.
Alex will pick you up.
- 81?
- That's it, 81, straight.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
81, you're sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
Because I just went through,
and I'm falling in space.
Sorry, my mistake.
It was number 18.
That's okay.
We all make mistakes.
Any idea to
get me out of here?
Alex, pick him up on 81.
I'm in. Close it.
Ah. Bring on the beach.
I'm not sure
where you come from.
But I know where
I wanna send you.
Valerian, hold still.
We're analyzing
its system of defense.
Major, their protective shield
is too sophisticated.
You won't get through.
I'm gonna try something bigger.
Shit.
Laureline, which one has
the Commander on board?
Nine o'clock, lower level.
Hurry up.
That's the one.
Don't lose it.
Valerian, be careful.
The Intruder's too big
to follow him.
I'm gonna take the Skyjet.
Okay.
Okay, Valerian.
You're near the dead zone.
Reel them in before I lose you.
I'm workin' on it.
Valerian, you need to go faster.
Valerian, you've got ten seconds
before I lose you.
Take that!
Who's the clever one now?
Valerian, you've got five seconds.
Oh, no, not me.
- Valerian?
- I can't slow him down.
Come on.
Come on.
Entering Red Zone.
Entering Red Zone.
Valerian, do you hear me?
Laureline!
I'm losing control!
Laureline!
Valerian, answer me.
Valerian, answer me.
Major, respond.
Alex, can you help?
There's too much interference.
I've lost the Major's signal.
Valerian? Valerian?
Valerian, do you copy?
We've lost him.
- Sergeant, where are you going?
- To grab my Skyjet.
- You won't be going after him.
- Why not?
That zone is under enemy control.
It's too dangerous.
An enemy that we don't know.
An enemy that's just attacked us.
By putting us to sleep and
not hurting a single one of us.
Why would they spare our lives?
Give me one good reason.
I don't know.
Valerian has seen
these creatures before.
They are from planet Mül.
Planet Mül was destroyed
30 years ago.
You're not making any sense.
It's our mission that
doesn't make sense, Sir.
Someone is lying to us.
And while you find out who,
I'm going to go save my partner.
General, Major Valerian
is an invaluable agent.
You cannot afford to lose him.
No, I can't afford to lose
both of you in one day.
Restrain her.
Put us on high alert.
And find me the Commander.
Yes, sir.
Listen, I don't wanna tell you
guys how to do your jobs,
but don't you think
you should cuff me?
Firstly, because it's protocol.
But secondly, because I'm
very tempted to escape.
Good job, boys.
We need to talk.
- Oh, it's dark in here.
- Not supposed to be here.
- Ow!
- Sorry.
If you don't
help me find Valerian,
then this bullet's gonna find you.
You're up first.
- No, no, no, no.
- It's to avoid such situations.
- But all of our information.
- Is divided three ways.
- Kill one of us.
- And you kill the information.
What a pity that would be.
Okay, you're gonna have to
give me credit, though.
'Cause I don't have much on me.
- Oh, how tiresome.
- If the Commander were here,
he could use the
converter to pay us.
But he's been abducted.
Precisely, because he
had the converter on him.
Unless for security reasons.
Someone else was
carrying it on them.
How in space
did you get that info?
- It's not info.
- Just deduction.
- We know how humans work.
- They're all so predictable.
Clearly, you've never
met a woman.
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Calm down.
What do you want to know?
Valerian's exact location.
Hard to tell.
But we know how to
track him down.
With complete precision.
- How much?
- 100 badools.
- Each.
- Forget about it.
This is all I have.
Diamonds are less
valuable than badools.
The negotiation is over.
- We trust you.
- And under the circumstances.
We accept the deal.
Good.
Now, take me to Valerian. Now.
- Follow us.
- Follow us.
Phillips, head to the location
where the Major disappeared.
Mylo, track down Agent Laureline
and bring her in.
Neza, inform the Minister.
Yes, sir.
Just give me
a few minutes, please.
Declassify.
I need all information
on the planet Mül.
Well, who has
authority over this file?
- Here we are.
- Do not like this place.
- Give it to me.
- Uh-huh.
I've got a bad feeling
about this idea of yours.
Bingo.
What do you want?
- We'd like to go fishing.
- For a cortex jellyfish.
Male, if possible.
Ah, it's not the season.
Here.
- Males are harder to catch.
- And here.
Welcome aboard.
Uh, the thing, down.
Down, the thing!
This one?
Down. Ay.
There.
Bromosaurs.
- Are they dangerous?
- Not really.
You just have to be careful
they don't inhale you.
There.
That one is a male.
How can you tell?
Oh, they're much
smaller than the females.
How do you know that
that one has a jellyfish on it?
All males do. The Bromosaurs
blow out pure water
which the jellyfish can't do without.
That's why they live on them.
All year round.
That's where they get
their hypersensitivity from.
Soft as silk.
Can I help?
I'm a good driver.
Shhh!
Mmm, Mmm, Ahh.
- Seat belt.
- What?
Seat belt!
I thought you said
they weren't aggressive.
Except when you
take their little buddy.
Great.
I'm Bob, by the way.
Hi.
There's no time to lose.
The cortex jellyfish
is extremely fragile.
Show it images of Valerian.
And it will show you
what it has seen.
Sure, but how?
- You have to put it.
- On your head.
Down to your shoulders.
- You're kidding.
- Never when we're working.
- Through a kind of osmosis.
- You'll be able to communicate.
- But be very careful.
- Not to stay under there.
- Longer than a minute.
- Because then, it starts to feed.
On your memory.
Great.
Anything else I should know
before I voluntarily stick
my head on his mouth?
Actually, it's not his mouth.
- You can begin.
- Good luck.
- Don't forget.
- One minute.
Not a second more.
I knew I had it
in here somewhere.
- Ah.
- There we are.
Pee-yew.
- Ah.
- There we go.
This is so exciting.
Valerian?
I only work with my partner.
Valerian, answer me.
What can I do
to make it up to you?
30 seconds.
Valerian, answer me.
Take that.
Laureline!
I'm losing control!
Valerian!
Valerian!
Laureline!
40 seconds!
Valerian!
50 seconds!
- Get out!
- Now!
55 seconds!
Valerian!
Valerian!
Valerian!
Beautiful!
Incredible!
- One minute!
- And ten seconds!
A record!
Okay.
L, 630,
E, SUL, deactivated.
Any idea what that means, guys?
- Level 630 east.
- Most likely a self bay pod.
Deactivated, apparently.
Okay, okay, thanks.
- You need a detailed map?
- You need a detailed map?
We biologically traced
Sergeant Laureline to here.
What's she doing out
by the Galana Sea?
No idea, sir.
She stole a vehicle.
She headed into the Red Zone.
And we lost track of her.
She must've located the Major.
General, there are three
civilians here
who claim to have information
that might interest you.
Show them in.
It's you three.
Our humble respects, General.
- May you be healthy.
- And prosperous.
What do you want?
We have information
of the utmost importance.
- That we're ready to sell.
- 100 badools.
- Each!
- Each!
Shoot.
Valerian!
Move, lizard.
Valerian?
Valerian, do you hear me?
Valerian, wake up.
Valerian, please.
Stay with me, Valerian.
Come on, come on.
What are you doing here?
I came to get you.
You totaled your Skyjet,
remember?
Yeah.
I lost it in the curve.
You mean, you almost died.
You're lucky I found you.
What about the Commander.
Do we know where he is?
There's no sign of him.
Their spaceship went into
a Red Zone.
We gotta find him.
- Let's go.
- Wait.
Is that all?
What do you mean?
No 'Thank you'?
No 'Well done'?
I would've done
the same for you.
You little prick!
Whoa, hey, hey, hey!
Chill!
I trusted you more
than I trusted myself
Isn't that what you wanted?
No.
You are an amazing woman,
Laureline.
It's no wonder
I wanna marry you.
Why would I wanna marry
an ungrateful, conceited...
Because you can't
live without him.
I mean look, whenever he wanders off,
you go chasing after him.
I was just doing my job, Major.
Now, will you please let me
get back to the mission?
Yeah... sure.
- Good.
- Sergeant.
Captain, what's going on here?
I report directly to the
Commander Arun Filitt...
I am General Okto-Bar!
In the absence of the Commander,
I am in command on Alpha.
Arrest this man.
Now, release that one.
I apologize for your
mistreatment.
We will take you to a jail,
but our doctors will
take care of you.
Help us.
If you need my help,
you have to tell me
everything you know.
But first of all,
why are you attacking us?
Because you have...
what we need.
Didn't you say that
the girl in your dream
had a converter just like mine?
That's right.
So, if the animals are native
on their planet,
then surely it's understandable
that they want to retrieve
the last living specimen.
Yeah, and they probably
kidnapped the Commander
because they thought
he was carrying it.
Yeah, once they
find out he's not,
then I'll be at
the top of their list.
Don't worry, I'm not
letting you go anywhere.
No, I'm not letting
you go anywhere.
Pretty butterfly.
Sure, but whatever you do,
don't touch 'em.
- Why?
- Because some of them are...
No!
Valerian!
Laureline!
I'm coming!
Let me go, fatty.
Come on, put me down!
Sorry, I'm inedible.
Valerian!
Major, I can read
your signal now.
Valerian!
Alex, any ideas?
The only way to get in
without creating a
a severe diplomatic incident
is to pass for one of them.
I suggest you try
to find a Glamopod.
Thanks, Alex.
Have you run a
DNA search?
Yes.
But it didn't match any
of the 800 million species
we have in our database.
Well, how is that possible?
Either it belongs to a
completely unknown species...
Or?
Or their species was deliberately
deleted from the database.
General,
the Major has resurfaced
at the edge of the Red Zone.
Which district is he in?
Paradise Alley.
Notify all units.
All units: Search Alert.
Major Valerian.
Not dangerous.
Find and assist.
Can I help you?
Sure, you can.
Move.
Good. Now slide your gun
into my holster.
Hold still.
It tastes its desires...

I'm lookin' for somethin'

Well, of course you are.

I need to leave.

You like Techno,
Macro, Bio, Nano?
- I'm more Retro.

Oldies are goodies.
Sit down.
Relax.

Look, that was...

But not exactly what
I'm lookin' for right now.
Well, I have
a whole lot more in stock
if you just tell me
what you have in mind.
I have a lot in mind.
And no time for this.
I'll pass.
Listen, I have a problem
and I really need your help.
You didn't like my performance?
No, no, yeah, I...
I loved it.
Absolutely!
I started at age four.
Learning my trade
in all the top schools.
I can play anyone or anything.
I'm sure you can.
I know all of Shakespeare
by heart, if you want.
Poetry, maybe?
You like poetry?
Uh, sure.
Rimbaud? Valerian?
Tough choice.
"I'm afraid of a kiss
"Like the kiss of a bee
"I suffer like this
"And wake endlessly
"I'm afraid of a kiss"
How 'bout I tell you
what I really have in mind?
Quit screamin'!
Where'd you get a gun?
Major Valerian!
I advise you
to put that gun down!
And I advise you to sit down.
Okay, okay, okay.
Please, no, don't shoot me!
What the hell is that?
That is you
when you were ten.
You're not going to
shoot yourself, are you?
Will you go back
to normal, please?
Okay, okay.
No, not... this normal.
The other one.
Okay, okay.
Thank you.
What's your name?
Whatever you
want it to be, sweetie.
I don't have time for your
games, sweetie.
Come on, tell me
what's your name.
Bubble.
Look, Bubble,
I lost my partner.
If you help me find her,
I'll set you free.
What good is freedom
when you're an
illegal immigrant
far away from home?
I work for the government, okay?
You have an ID pass.
You have my word.
If I leave,
Jolly will kill me.
No, Jolly won't kill
anybody ever again.
So, what do you say,
Bubble?
You really liked my performance?
Best I ever saw.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hm-hm.
So, uh,
I'm gonna take ten.
You two keep an eye on
old soldier boy, huh?
He seems like a
real freak to me.
Okay, Bubble, get off me.
All right, all right,
I'm doin' this.
Hey, you good?
Thanks.
You wanna go in there?
Yeah, but no
foreigners are allowed.
The only way in is
to look like one of them.
Oh, no, no, no!
I've never played
a Boulan-Bathor before!
What?
Are you an artist or not?
Yes, but, I need time
to get into my role, and
capture my movements
and behaviors, and
character's arc,
we do a couple rehearsals,
you give me some notes...
Well, a little improv
never hurt anyone.
Let's go.
All right.
Turn around.
Ugh.
This is
not right.
I need a manicure.
Don't you think the hat
might be a little bit over-the-top?
Never mind.
Hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing?
Give me a second
to get the hang of it.
Hurry, people are staring at us.
I told you
I needed rehearsals.
This is a heavy role.
Much better.
You're doing good.
General,
we picked up the Major's
trail again.
Finally.
Where is he?
In Boulan-Bathor territory.
In the Bou...
Wha...?
Nobody gets in there.
And definitely not
out of there.
We need reinforcements.
Inform the Minister.
Yes, sir.
So, how did you come
to lose your partner?
- Because I'm stupid.
- What do you mean?
All I do is flirt and joke.
Oh, tryin' to be cool
rather than being honest.
Story of my life.
How young were you
when you lost your mom?
Please don't go there right now.
It's okay to be
vulnerable sometimes.
Can we stop this and go
back to the mission, please?
And don't touch anything!
Well, it wouldn't hurt you
to show some weakness.
I'm not good at that.
It will make her
feel important.
Yeah, believe me,
she's already the most
important thing in my life.
I think he wants us
to join the group.
Uh, I'm not sure
that's a good idea.
It doesn't look like he's
giving us much choice.
What's goin' on?
I guess it's lunchtime for
Emperor Boulan III.
Ugh. Bussin' tables?
Every artist's worst nightmare.
Never mention this
to anyone, okay?
Thank your lucky stars
we're not the main course.
I'm gonna be sick.
There she is!
Wow, you're right.
She's a 10.
Hi.
Something's wrong.
How 'bout I do a little dance
to create a diversion?
No, thanks.
You guys are in
big trouble!
I think we should go.
I think you should let
me handle this.
Valerian!
I'm in here!
Hey!
You're gonna be
a good boy, okay?
Down.
Stay.
Laureline, it's me,
Valerian.
What?
Bubble, get off me.
Yes, you're right.
Let's go! Whoo!
Ah, excuse me,
your highness.
Hey, baby.
I deserve that.
Watch out!
This is a lady.
You can't fight her.
Let's talk about this.
You're gonna hurt yourself.
I warned you.
Well, that's what I call
a partner.
Woo-hoo!
Bravo!
That was amazing.
I'm very impressed!
Hey.
Hey.
Trust me on this.
3rd Regiment approaching, sir.
- Any news from our agents?
- None.
And the Commander,
any ransom demands?
Negative.
Minister online.
Okay.
- My respects, Minister.
- General.
You've been authorized
by the Council
to assume command
of this operation.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.
But to fulfill my mission,
I will need full access
to Commander Filitt's data.
According to regulations,
that isn't possible without
his explicit agreement.
The Commander may well be dead.
If I am to succeed
in my new assignment,
I need to know everything.
Access granted.
Thank you, sir.
Declassify.
Request file
on the planet Mül.
Request authorized.
Huh, the conflict with
the southern territories.
The war against Arysum-Kormn led to
the destruction of planet Mül.
Tell me more about the planet.
The planet was uninhabited.
Who's in charge
of this operation?
This does not smell good.
I told you there was a door.
Someone didn't look
over the plans
before they came rushing in.
As usual.
You'd rather I show up
after the main event?
I'd rather you took me someplace
other than a giant trash can.
Bubble?
Bubble, where are you?
- Where is she?
- She was right behind us.
I'm here.
What's wrong?
I must've been injured
during the fight.
Bubble,
tell me what to do.
Nothing you could do.
Anyway, where I'm from...
Life is more
painful than death.
Don't say that.
Unfortunately, it's true.
It's a drag when you don't have
an identity to call your own.
You do have an identity.
You're the greatest artist
I've ever seen.
I thank you.
It was my pleasure
performing for you.
I leave you my kingdom.
Take good care of it.
I will.
- But most importantly...
- Yeah?
Take good care of her.
Love her without measure.
"There's beggary in love
that can be reckoned."
Let's go.
All the battleships
have docked, General.
Good. I want Section One
operative as soon as possible.
What are these K-Tron
doing there?
The Commander
programmed them personally.
They can't be deactivated.
Great.
That's all we need.
Do you have any idea
where we're going?
Yeah, sure, I mean...
- I guess...
- You're sure, or you guess?
Look, I know
it sounds strange, but it...
The Princess...
she's guiding me.
The Princess?
She's guiding you?
Yeah, the... Look, it's hard
to explain, but...
It's like she's...
been with me the whole time.
Wait.
You mean to tell me that
you've had a woman
inside of you
since the beginning?
Laureline, can we just
keep going, please?
Sure.
Ladies first.
Ha. Hilarious.
- What you doin'?
- Villainy, villainy!
Captain Kris.
Section One operational, General.
Proceed. A unit of
K-Trons will join you.
- That won't be necessary.
- Commander's orders.
Not mine.
Copy that.
Move on.
We've been manipulated
from the start.
What do you mean?
We're in the middle of
the dead zone
and we can breathe properly.
It seems there's no sign
of contamination.
The Commander's fully aware
of what's behind this
so-called absolute evil.
What?
Pearls.
My name is Tsûuri.
I am the Emperor's son.
Great, how about you
introduce us to daddy?
He is expecting you.
Try to contact the General.
Get everyone down here.
I'll buy us some time.
How about you run for back up
for a change?
Unbelievable.
Follow me.
I'd like you to
meet my father.
The Emperor.
My name is Haban-Limaï
And this is my wife, Aloï
We're pleased
to welcome you here.
My son sensed
the presence of his sister,
Princess Lïho-Minaa in you.
It seems she chose you.
What do you mean?
At the moment of passing,
Pearls release all the
energy left in their body
in the form of a wave
which travels
through space and time.
Sometimes, it finds
a benevolent host.
Lïho-Minaa chose you
to be the guardian of her soul.
Told you.
My daughter.
I'm so happy to see you.
Same here.
I mean... she is, too.
What exactly happened
to you and your people?
Our planet was a true paradise
on which we lived in harmony
with the elements.
Our main activity was
fishing for the pearls.
who possessed phenomenal energy.
They fertilized our lands.
Controlled the winds and tides.
Three time a year,
we gave to the earth.
What the sea has given us.
We lived like this in harmony
for centuries and centuries.
Until the day of the apocalypse.
In the sky, over our planet
other people blindly
fought out a brutal war.
A war between people
we didn't even know.
Missiles loaded, sir.
Engage fusion missiles.
Do you confirm, sir?
Yes, I do.
At your command.
By the grace of God.
Your daughter died
during the battle.
Yes, like six million others.
What happened after the explosion?
We drifted in space for many years.
Aboard a vessel we salvaged
from the wreckage.
And that was half-destroyed.
Come back to your room.
This new environment
was quite different from ours.
And at first, we needed
time to understand it.
Absorbing the vast knowledge
stored in its database.
We learned languages
and mathematics.
Physics, chemistry,
and philosophy.
We learned about the millions
of planets and stars
and moons in a universe
we never knew existed.
And we learned of the countless
species who inhabit this universe.
Including humans, the ones
who destroyed our planet.
Thank you.
Time has not dimmed
the memories of our loss.
But it has allowed us
to let go of our anger
toward those responsible.
Hey!
Look.
Then one day, we were
picked up by scrap dealers
travelling the galaxy.
After a few years,
their hold was full.
And they went off
to sell their cargo
on a huge construction site.
- Alpha.
- Yes.
The City of a Thousand Planets.
Where for hundreds of years,
so many species
have shared their knowledge
and intelligence with each other.
In the shadows of Alpha,
we lived undetected.
All the while watching and
learning from each of them.
Until we acquired both
the knowledge
and the materials to build
a vessel of our own.
Our planet is gone forever.
But with what we have learned
we are now able to replicate
and restore our lost world.
Amazing.
There are only
two things that we lack.
A Mül converter.
And the pearl.
The only one Tsûuri
managed to salvage.
We are survivors.
But that makes us witnesses.
Witnesses of a past
humans want to erase
and forget forever.
We can forgive,
but how can we forget?
So, we left you no choice
but to steal the converter.
And Tsûuri hired a professional.
Igon Siruss.
Then Major Valerian intervenes
and retrieves the converter.
Which left you
with only one choice,
kidnap the Commander,
force him to tell you the truth.
You know our story now.
Our destiny is in your hands.
Major,
arrest these creatures
immediately.
They kidnapped me.
They're extremely dangerous.
They're Pearls
from the planet Mül.
I heard their ridiculous story.
That's impossible.
Mül was uninhabited.
Their existence proves the contrary,
doesn't it?
I am telling you,
there was no life on the planet.
The detectors were categorical.
Arrest them.
How can you be so sure?
Because...
I write the reports and...
And you were on board.
Yes. Yes, I was on board.
And we had much more
serious things to worry about.
Our cruisers were
being decimated.
We lost 500,000 soldiers
in a day.
It was complete carnage!
You were so preoccupied,
you didn't see the detectors
indicating signs of life
on the planet.
Or even worse, perhaps you knew
that planet was inhabited
and you sacrificed it.
Commander,
the planet is inhabited.
By primitive lifeforms.
No, Commander.
I've detected a complex language
and huge cerebral energy.
Major.
History is on the march.
And neither you
nor a bunch of savages
are gonna stand in its way.
So, when you realized
survivors from planet Mül
were living in the heart of Alpha,
you decided to erase
any trace of your mistake.
Rather than accept
the consequences.
I want no survivors.
And you destroyed all the evidence
Major Samk had against you.
What did you expect me to do?!
It was the only way!
Admitting to an error
on this scale
would've exposed our
government to colossal damages
and compensation claims.
Our economy
would never recover.
In one instance,
we would've lost
our supremacy
and our leadership.
There would've been
immediate sanctions.
And it's a pretty good bet
that we would've been
banished from Alpha.
And denied access
to the greatest
market of knowledge
and intelligence.
Is that what you would've
wanted for your fellow citizens?
Leading them into
ruin and degradation?
Forcing them to go
backwards 1,000 years?
Our council saw fit to protect
our citizens first and foremost.
Is that not its duty?
And mine?
And yours?!
Or would you rather risk
wrecking our economy
for the sake of a bunch of...
Savages?
You are totally under the
influence of these creatures.
Do not confuse the issue.
He's the threat.
He's the enemy.
You are your own
worst enemy, Commander.
Unless you make peace
with your past,
you won't have a future.
Major,
I order you
to arrest this man.
Can we talk man-to-man
for a second?
Major, what are you doing?
I taught him
how to do that.
Nice talk.
Move on, move on,
move on.
Section One is entering
the Red Zone.
Prepare Section Two
for an advance also.
Look, this was a lot of fun
but we gotta report
back to our people.
Here, that's yours.
I'm gonna make this right.
I promise.
Let's get this guy...
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?
I'm giving them
back the converter.
No.
The pearl is useless
without this.
Yeah, but...
- Will you give us a second, please?
- What?
That converter
is government property.
Most likely the last one
in the whole universe.
Oh, so, you buy into
the Commander's
what's mine is mine and
what's yours is mine philosophy?
No, I buy into
my oath of allegiance.
We have no authority
to hand it over.
The Federation messed up
and must make amends.
Yeah, I agree, but that's
not for us to decide.
Leave it to the courts.
They're 18 light-years
away, Valerian.
Only we can make this right.
Laureline, I'm a soldier.
I play by the rules.
It's what makes me
who I am.
You see...
That's why I don't
wanna marry you
because you really
don't know what love is.
Oh, come on, this has
nothing to do with love.
That's where you're wrong.
Love is more powerful
than anything else, Valerian.
It breaks all rules and laws.
And overpowers any
army or government.
Just look at her.
For one second,
put yourself in her position.
She lost all of her people
and her child.
And she's willing to forgive.
That's real love.
It's the trust you place
in someone else, and
I thought I could be
that someone else for you.
- But clearly...
- You can.
You are.
I'd die for you.
I'm not asking you
to die for me.
I'm asking you to trust me.
All right.
Give it to 'em.
Thank you.
We are to blame
for the loss of your planet.
And we'd be honored
to help you get it back.
Here.
It means 'thank you'.
Spread out.
Spread out.
Captain, we're locked on to you.
Any sign of contamination
or radiation?
Zero trace of either.
It doesn't make any sense.
Didn't you say you wanted
to go to the beach?
Our daughter made a good choice.
She can rest in peace now.
We must leave now.
May you and your people
live in peace
wherever you may venture
in space and time.
Explosives in place, General.
We're operational.
Received. Evacuate the zone.
You have four minutes.
Copy that.
Father, there are hundreds of soldiers
all around the spaceship.
We will be gone in a miunte.
The troops are in position,
you don't have a minute.
You have no means of communication
to the outside world?
If we stop jamming signals,
we are defenseless.
If you don't allow me
to communicate with them,
you'll be defenseless forever.
Just one call.
- Disarm the signal.
- Thank you.
The walls stopped moving.
Something's going on.
Maintain your position.
We're analyzing the data.
I can't believe they'd do that.
The General would follow procedure.
Yeah, I hate procedure.
Captain, the data shows
that they've built
some kind of vessel
beyond the wall.
Contact with the enemy.
Give me a physical description.
Same creatures who
kidnapped the Commander.
Are they showing
any signs of hostility?
Not really.
- Are they armed?
- No.
General, we're picking up a signal
from the 2005 Destiny module.
What?
Sounds like Major Valerian.
Patch him through.
Major, you're online
with the General.
- Major.
- Yeah.
Major Valerian and Sergeant Laureline
We're alive and on
the inside of the wall.
Call off the assault immediately.
Major, I can't read your DNA codes.
You know the procedure.
I have to be certain it's you.
There is no time
for dumbass procedures.
We are here with
a whole species of people
you've already wiped out once.
The Pearls of Planet Mül.
So, tell your men
to back off
before you commit a second genocide!
That's definitely her temper.
Planet Mül was uninhabited.
Come on, you know
that's not true.
The Commander was there.
He gave the orders.
And then he organized
this whole procedure
to eliminate any survivors.
The living proof of his mistake.
Stop the procedure.
Maybe that'll explain
why the Commander
was interrogating that creature.
Is the Commander with you?
Come on.
Wakey-wakey.
- You're gonna call.
- What?
Ow!
Let's go, my friend.
Time to confess.
Hello?
No DNA code.
But voice waves match.
This is General Okto-Bar.
Do you read me, Commander?
What's going on?
We are ready to activate
the explosive device.
In accordance
with the orders you gave.
Do you confirm those orders?
Or do you have
anything to tell me
That would enable me
to suspend the assault?
I'm a soldier.
A soldier will always choose
death over humiliation.
Annihilate them all.
What the hell are you doing?
I didn't give the orders!
Captain,
cease fire immediately!
It's not us, it's the K-Trons.
They're shooting at us!
Come on, you...
I'm gonna get Tsûuri
some back up.
Keep an eye on him.
Oh, he's not going anywhere.
Get down!
Take cover!
Alex, load me up
with all you've got.
- Copy that.
- Thanks.
Neza, stop this countdown now!
Yes, sir.
Hurry, Neza!
Hurry, Neza!
How much time left?
Ten seconds!
Hurry!
Neza.
Check for survivors.
Captain, status report.
Nothing's left.
Just a gaping hole.
They left with their spaceship.
Everything's vanished.
And our agents?
Valerian and Laureline?
- No, nothing.
- And the Commander?
Anyone there?
Wait, I hear something.
There's a body.
Get me down from here,
you children!
It's the Commander.
Is he alive?
Affirmative.
Alive and kicking.
Good.
Arrest him.
Help!
Do you have any idea
what they left us?
We're two hours away
from vacation.
I fired the distress beacons.
Two hours?
Yeah, I know, two hours
alone with me. What a drag.
No kidding.
It's basically an eternity.
Hey...
Now that our mission's over,
Maybe we could
finish our conversation.
What conversation?
We were talking about
the future.
Really?
And what does
the future hold?
You.
Me.
Us.
Happy birthday.
Thank you, Valerian.
That is so romantic.
Did you really
think of this yourself?
Yeah. You mean so much to me,
you know.
Laureline...
Will you do me the honor
of becoming my wife?
For better or worse?
Uh, worse?
Is that negotiable?
No.
All right, then.
Is that a yes?
It's a maybe.
I'm confused.
Is this how love works?
No, this is how I work.
You spent a day
in a woman's body.
Did you not learn anything?
Yeah.
I did learn something.
What?
I want only your name
