My name is known:
God and King.
I am most in majesty in whom
no beginning may be and no end.
Highest in potency I am...
...and have been ever.
I have made stars and planets
in their courses to go.
I have made a moon for the night...
...and the sun to light the day also.
I have made earth...
...where trees and grasses spring.
Beasts and fowl,
both great and small...
...all thrive and have my liking.
I have made all of nothing
for man's sustenation...
...and of this pleasant garden
that I have mostly goodly planted...
...I will make him gardener
for his own re-creation.
Back it out of there!
Come on! Back it up!
Will you back it out of here?
What do you say?
I got the right of way.
Look at that mess! Come on!
I got the right of way.
Go on, get out of here!
Don't just stand there!
I ain't got all day,
I got places to go!
Come here, come here!
What?
Prepare ye
The way of the Lord
Prepare ye
The way of the Lord
Hey, Merrell!
Where you going?
Prepare ye
The way of the Lord
Everybody now!
Everybody now!
I baptize you with water
for repentance...
...but He that comes after me
is mightier than I.
I'm not fit to take off His shoes.
And He will baptize you all...
...with the Holy Spirit and with fire!
You come to me?
I want to get washed up.
I would rather be baptized by you.
No, we do well now to conform
with all that God requires.
When wilt thou save the people
O God of mercy, when?
The people, Lord, the people
Not thrones and crowns
But men
Flowers of Thy heart
O God, are they
Let them not pass
Like weeds away
Their heritage
A sunless day
God save the people
Shall crime bring crime forever
Strength aiding still the strong
Is it Thy will, O Father
That men shall toil for wrong?
Oh no, say Thy mountains
No, say Thy skies
Man's clouded sun shall brightly rise
And songs be heard
Instead of sighs
God save the people
When wilt Thou save the people
O God of mercy, when?
The people, Lord, the people
Not thrones and crowns
But men
God save the people
For Thine they are
Thy children as Thy angels fair
God save the people
From despair
God save the people
God save the people
When wilt Thou save the people
O God of mercy, when?
The people, Lord, the people
Not thrones and crowns
But men
God save the people
O Thine they are
Thy children as Thy angels fair
God save the people
From despair
- Let's go!
- Look at this!
Look at that car!
Watch the birdy.
Leaving so soon?
Wake me at 6...
...for tea and biscuits.
Make that noon.
Who is it?
I said noon!
Come here, come here!
Oh, boy. Look!
Here. See if it fits.
Now, do not suppose that I have come
to abolish the Law and the prophets.
I did not come to abolish...
...but to complete.
I tell you this :
So long as Heaven
and earth endure...
...not a letter...
...not a stroke will disappear
from the Law...
...until all that must happen
has happened.
If any man, therefore...
...sets aside even the least
of the Law's demands...
...he will have the lowest place...
...in the kingdom of Heaven.
But he who keeps the Law...
...and teaches others so...
...he will have the highest place
in the kingdom of Heaven.
Unless you show yourselves to be
far better than the Pharisees...
...and the doctors of the Law...
...you shall never enter
the kingdom of Heaven.
Amen!
Brothers and sisters
gather around...
...because two men...
...I said two, went off to
the temple to pray.
One, a Pharisee...
...and the other...
...a tax gatherer.
While the Pharisee, he just stood
right on up and prayed thus:
I thank Thee, O God,
that I am not like other men.
Greedy, dishonest, adulterous...
...or for that matter,
like that tax gatherer.
I pray twice a week.
Get that? Twice a week!
And pay taxes on all that I get.
But the other kept his distance...
...and would not even raise his eyes
to the good Lord in Heaven.
- I said, "The good Lord in Heaven"!
- Amen!
But beat upon his breast, saying :
"Oh, God, have mercy on me...
...sinner that I am."
And it was this man, I tell you--
You've got to be kidding!
And not the other, who went off
and quitted of his sins.
For every man who exalts himself...
...shall be humbled.
But every man who humbles himself...
Shall be...
...exalted!
What if your brother sues you?
You better settle with him quickly.
- Or he'll hand you over to the judge.
- Guilty!
And the judge to the constable...
...and you'll land in jail!
Let me out of here!
I tell you...
...you'll not get out of there
until you've paid the last penny.
There once was a king
Who decided to settle accounts
With the men who served him
At the outset
There appeared before the master
A man whose debt
Ran into the millions
I said the millions
Since the man had no means of paying
The master ordered him to be sold
To meet the debt
With his wife
And his child
And everything he had
The man threw himself
Down at the master's feet and went:
- Be patient with me.
- He said.
And I shall pay in full.
And so moved with pity
was the master...
...that he decided to free the man...
...and remit the debt.
And let's hear it for the master!
Give me an M!
Give me an A-S-T-E-R!
Yay, master!
Wait a minute.
No sooner had he been released...
...that he met a servant
who owed him a few dollars.
He gripped him by
the throat and said :
Pay me! I says pay me
what you owes me!
The man fell at his fellow servant's
feet and begged him, saying:
Please, please be patient with me.
I shall pay you.
But he refused, saying :
Look!
And had him jailed
until he should pay.
Well, the other servants
were deeply distressed...
...when they saw what had happened.
Are you sitting down?
They ran and told their master
the whole story.
Accordingly, he sent for the man.
You scoundrel!
He said to him.
I remitted the whole of your debt
when you appealed to me.
Were you not bound to show your fellow
servant the same pity I show to you?
And so angry was the master...
...that he condemned the man
to torture...
...until he could pay...
...the debt in full.
And that is how my Heavenly Father
will deal with you...
...unless you forgive your brothers
from your hearts.
Master.

You have heard, "An eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth."
But what I tell you is this :
Never set yourself against
the man who wrongs you.
So if someone slaps you
on your right cheek...
...turn and offer him your left.
Oh, Jesus Chr--
Slowly I turn...
...step by step...
...inch by inch.
It's for you.
No, I didn't think so.
Now, when the Son of Man
comes in all His glory...
...with all His angels with Him...
...He will sit in state
upon His throne...
...with all the nations
gathered before Him.
He'll separate the men
into two groups...
...as a shepherd separates
the sheep from the goats.
He'll put the sheep on His right...
...and the goats on His left.
Over there.
Sheep on His right.
The sheep on His right. I see.
Thank you.
And then He will say
to those on His right:
Sheep...
-...you have my Father's blessing.
- Oh, wonderful!
Enter the kingdom that's been
ready since the world was made.
For when I was hungry,
you gave me food.
When I was thirsty,
you gave me drink.
When I was naked and without a home,
you took me in.
And when I was ill and in prison,
you came to my aid.
Sorry.
No goats.
Baloney!
Then they will say to Him :
Master, when was it that we saw
youse hungry and gave youse food...
...or thirsty and gave youse drink?
Yeah!
Or in prison and helped you?
And He will say to them :
"Anything you did
for one of your brothers...
...however humble, you did for me."
I get it!
And He will say to them :
A curse is upon you!
Then they'll say to Him :
Big boy, if we'd have
known it was you...
...we would've taken you around
the corner for a cup of coffee.
And He will say to them :
"Anything you did not do for one of
your brothers, however humble...
...you did not do for me."
And then they will take their place
in eternal punishment.
But the righteous
shall have eternal life!
Come on!
Come on.
The lamp...
...of the body...
...is the eye.
If your eye...
...is sound...
...your whole...
...body...
...will be filled...
...with light!
But...
...if your eye...
...is bad...
...your whole...
...body...
...will be darkness.
If then...
...the only...
...light...
...you have...
...is darkness...
...the darkness will be doubly dark.
Hey, I can't see!
- What's the matter?
- I got my eyes shut.
Now, no servant can be
the slave of two masters.
Either he will love the first
and think nothing of the second...
...or be devoted to the second
and hate the first.
No man can serve God...
...and money.
Ritz Hotel.
Take me to Tiffany's.
- Where's she going?
- Look at this.
Turn back
O man
Forswear thy foolish ways
Old now is earth
And none may count her days
Yet thou
Her child
Whose head is crowned with flame
Stop it!
Still wilt not hear
Thine inner God proclaim
Turn back, O man
Oh, I like that!
Turn back, O man
Handle with care.
Turn back, O man
Forswear thy foolish ways
Pardon me, while I slip into
something more comfortable.
Earth might
Be fair
And all men glad and wise
Age after age
Their tragic
Empires rise
Built while
They dream
And in that dreaming weep
Would man but wake
From out his haunted sleep
Turn back, O man
Turn back, O man
Hard as a rock!
Turn back, O man
Forswear thy foolish ways
Earth shall be fair
And all her people one
Not till that hour
Shall God's whole will be done
Now, even now
Once more from earth to sky
Peals forth in joy
Man's old undaunted cry
Earth shall be fair
And all her people one
Come here, Jesus.
I got something to show you.
Turn back
O man
Forswear thy foolish ways
Old now is earth
And none may count her days
Yet thou
Her child
Whose head is crowned with flame
Still wilt not hear
Thine inner God proclaim
Turn back, O man
Turn back, O man
Turn back, O man
Forswear...
...thy...
...foolish...
...ways
Play it, honey!
A man was on his way
from Jerusalem to Jericho...
...when he fell among robbers...
...who beat him...
...stripped him...
...and left...
...leaving him half-dead.
It so happened
a priest came upon him.
But when he saw him,
he went past on the other side.
So too, a judge...
...came to the place...
...and saw him...
...and he went past
on the other side.
But...
...a Samaritan was making the journey.
He came upon him,
and when he saw him...
...he was moved to pity.
He went up and bandaged his wounds...
...bathing them in oil and wine.
Then he put him onto his own beast
and brought him to an inn...
...and looked after him there.
The next day, he produced
two pieces of silver...
...and gave them to the innkeeper
and said:
"Look after him...
...and if you spend any more...
...I will repay on my way back."
Bravo!
When you do some act of charity,
don't announce it with trumpets...
...as the heathen do in synagogues
and in the streets.
I tell you, they do it
just to win admiration from men.
No, when you do
some act of charity...
...don't let your right hand know...
...what your left hand is doing.
Look at that!
Your good deed must be in secret.
It's a secret.
What the good Master is telling us
is that up in Heaven...
...there's about 100 million
tiny angels about yea-by-yea...
...and they all take shorthand.
Every time you do something silly,
they write it in--
That's not what the good Master
is telling us.
Your Heavenly Father,
who sees what is done in secret...
He will what?
Reward you!
Get him some flowers.
Thank you.
Thank you.
There once was
a very rich man...
...who dressed in purple
and the finest linen.
Rich man, that's me.
And every day he feasted--
Thank you, thank you...
Feasted in the greatest magnificence.
At his gate lay poor Lazarus...
...who would've been glad to eat
the scraps from the rich man's table.
Oh, my God, it's good!
Get out of there.
Even the doggy-doggies...
...used to come to Lazarus
and lick his open, running sores.
Sorry.
Well, one day,
the poor man died...
...and was carried away
by the angels to be with Abraham.
The rich man also died...
...and was buried...
...and was sent to Hades...
...where he was in torment.
He looked up...
...and there, far, far away...
...was Abraham...
...with Lazarus close beside him.
Oh, Father Abraham...
...have pity on me.
Send Lazarus to dip...
...the tip of his finger
in water to cool my tongue.
For I'm in agony in this fire.
Let go of me, will you!
Remember, my child, that
all the good things fell to you...
...while you were on earth.
And all the bad to Lois.
Lazarus.
Abraham.
Glad to know you.
And now it is he
who has consolation here...
...and it is you who are in agony.
Then, Father Abraham, send Lazarus
to my father's house...
...where I have five pies--
I mean, brothers...
...to warn them...
...so that they too may not come
to this place of torment.
They got Moses and the prophets.
Let them listen to them.
But if somebody from the dead
should rise, then they'd listen.
Look.
If they don't listen
to Moses and the prophets...
...they ain't gonna
listen to nobody.
Even if somebody should
rise from the dead.
Oh, bless the Lord, my soul
His grace to thee proclaim
And all that is within rejoin
To bless His holy name
Oh, bless the Lord, my soul
His mercies bear in mind
Forget not all His benefits
The Lord to thee is kind
He will not always chide
He will with patience wait
His wrath is ever slow to rise
And ready to abate
And ready to abate
And ready to
And ready to abate
He pardons all thy sins
Prolongs thy feeble breath
He healeth thine infirmities
And ransoms thee from death
Oh, bless the Lord, my soul
He clothes thee with His love
Upholds thee with His truth
And like the eagle He renews
The vigor of thy youth
Then bless His holy name
Whose grace has made thee whole
Whose loving kindness crown
Thy days
Bless the Lord, my soul
Bless the Lord, my soul
Oh, bless the Lord
My soul
Oh, bless the Lord, my soul
Bravo!
Master!
Master! Blessed are
the poor in spirit.
For theirs is
the kingdom of Heaven.
- Blessed are they who mourn.
- They shall be comforted.
- Blessed are the meek.
- They shall inherit the earth.
- They who hunger for justice.
- They shall be filled.
- The merciful!
- They shall have mercy.
- Blessed are the pure in heart.
- They shall see God.
- Blessed are the peacemakers!
- They shall be called children of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted
for righteousness' sake!
For theirs is the kingdom of Heaven!
Blessed are ye...
...when men shall persecute you
and revile you...
...and say all manner
of evil against you...
...falsely.
Did I ever tell you that
I used to read feet?
You used to what?
Some people read palms, tea leaves.
I read feet.
Look! Look what it says.
It says "rejoice."
It does?
It says "Keds."
No, it says "Rejoice.
Be exceedingly glad.
For great is your reward
in the kingdom of Heaven."
Come on!
When...
...you...
...feel...
...sad
Or under a curse
Your life is bad
Your prospects are worse
Your wife is sighing
Crying
And your olive tree is dying
Temples are graying
Teeth are decaying
And creditors weighing your purse
Your mood
And your robe
Are both a deep blue
You'd bet that Job
Had nothing on you
Don't forget that
When you get
Into Heaven you'll be blessed
Yes, it's all for the best
Some men live at ease
Doing what they please
Richer than the bees are in honey
Never growing old
Never feeling cold
Pulling pots of gold from thin air
The best in every town
Best at shaking down
Best at making mountains of money
They can't take it with them
But what do they care?
They get the center of the meat
Cushions on their seat
Houses on the street
Where it's sunny
Summers at the sea
Winters warm and free
All of this
And we get the rest
But who is the land for?
The sun and the sand for?
You guessed
it's all for the best
Thanks.
When you feel sad
Or under a curse
Your life is bad
Your prospects are worse
Your wife is sighing, crying
And your olive tree is dying
Temples are graying
Teeth are decaying
Creditors weighing your purse
Your mood and your robe
Are both a deep blue
Yes, sir
You'd bet that Job
Had nothing on you
Don't forget
That when you get to Heaven
You'll be blessed
Yes, it's all for the best
How can you take the speck of sawdust
out of your brother's eye...
...when all the time there's
this great plank in your own?
I don't know. How can you take
it out of your brother's eye...
...when there's this
great plank in your own?
You hypocrite!
First you take the plank
out of your eye...
...so you can see clearly to take
the speck out of your brother's.
Wait a minute!
That's no answer to the question.
Did I promise you
an answer to the question?
You guessed
it's all for the--
All your wrongs will be redressed.
Yes, it's all for the--
You must never be distressed.
Yes, it's all for the--
Someone's got to be oppressed.
Yes, it's all for the best
Hello.
Love your enemies.
- And pray for your persecutors.
- You don't mean...
-I do.
- You do?
I love you.
Come on!
Right here.
A sower went to sow some seed.
As he sowed, some seed
fell on the footpath...
...where it was trampled on,
and the birds ate it up.
Some seed fell on rock.
And after coming up--
Grow, grow, grow,
grow, grow, grow.
--Withered for lack of moisture.
And some seed fell
in among the weeds.
And the weeds grew up with it...
...and choked it.
And some seed fell into good soil.
Good soil!
Come on!
It grew and it yielded
a hundredfold.
Do you know what the seed is?
- A baby.
- Wrong!
The seed is the word of God.
And that seed which fell
along the footpath...
...represents those
who hear the word...
...but then the devil comes
and carries them off...
...for fear they should believe
and be saved.
And that which fell upon rock...
...they receive the word with joy.
But they have no root.
So in time of testing, they desert.
- Bye.
- See you.
And that which fell among weeds...
...hear the word, but their
growth is impaired by wealth...
...and cares and the pleasures
of the world.
They bring nothing to fruit.
No fruit, Robin.
But that which fell
among good soil...
Hey, good soil!
They hear the word with
a good and honest heart...
...and through their perseverance...
...yield a harvest.
We plow the fields and scatter
The good seed on the land
But it is fed and watered
By God's almighty hand
He sends the snow in winter
The warmth to swell the grain
The breezes and the sunshine
And soft refreshing rain
All good gifts around us
Are sent from Heaven above
So thank the Lord
Oh, thank the Lord
For all His love
Consider the lilies of the field.
They don't work.
They don't spin.
And yet, I tell you,
Solomon in all his splendor...
...was not attired
like one of these.
Now, if that's how God clothes
the grass which is here today...
...and tomorrow is thrown
unto the fire...
...will He not all the more
clothe you?
We thank Thee then, O Father
For all things bright and good
The seed time and the harvest
Our life, our health, our food
No gifts have we to offer
For all Thy love imparts
But that which Thou desirest
Our humble thankful hearts
All good gifts around us
Are sent from Heaven above
So thank the Lord
Oh, thank the Lord
For all His love
I really want to thank you, Lord
All good gifts around us
Are sent from Heaven above
All good gifts around us
Just thank you, Lord
Once upon a time, there was a man
who had two sons.
And the younger son
said to his father:
Father, give me
my share of the property!
So he divided his estate
between them.
A few days later, the younger son...
...turned the whole of his share
into cash.
And left home
for a distant country.
Where I squandered the money
on reckless living.
He'd spent it all when
a famine fell upon the country...
...and he began to feel the pinch.
So he decided to attach himself
to one of the local landowners...
...who sent him on the farm
to mind the pigs.
He would've been glad
to have filled his belly...
...with the pods
the pigs were eating...
...but no one gave him anything.
And then he came to his senses.
He said :
How many of my father's servants
have more food than they can eat...
...and here I am starving to death?
I will set off and I will go to
my father's house and say to him :
"Father, I have sinned against God
and against you.
I am no longer fit
to be called your son.
Treat me as one of
your paid servants."
So he set out for
his father's house.
Yes, and there he goes.
While he was still a long way off...
...his father saw him.
And his heart went out to him.
The son ran to meet his father...
...and like the spunky kid he is...
...threw his arms around him,
kissed him and said:
Father, I have sinned against God
and against you.
I am no longer fit
to be called your son.
Treat me as one of
your paid servants.
But the father called
to one of his servants :
Servant!
Quick, fetch me my robe,
my best one.
Put rings on his fingers
and bells on his toes...
...so he shall have music
wherever he goes.
Wrong story.
Put rings on his fingers
and shoes on his feet...
...and bring the fatted calf
and kill it.
I said kill it.
I said kill it!
And let us have a feast
to celebrate this here day...
...for this son of mine was lost...
...and is found...
...was dead and has come back to life.
Now, the oldest kid was
out on the farm working.
And on his way back,
as he approached the house...
...he heard music and dancing.
He called one of his servants
and asked him what it meant.
The servant said :
Your brother's come back home again.
Your father's killed
the fatted calf...
...because he got him back
safe and sound.
Well, the brother was
rather irritated by this.
He refused to go into the house.
The father came out
and pleaded with him.
But he retorted, saying :
You know how I've worked
for you all these years...
...and you never gave me
so much as a kid...
...for a feast with my friends.
But once this
son of yours turns up...
...after running through
your money with his women...
...you killed
the fatted calf for him.
I said kill it.
I said kill it!
"My boy," said the father.
"You've always been with me
and everything I have is yours.
Now, how could we help
but celebrate on this happy day...
...for your brother here was dead
and he's come back to life...
...metaphorically speaking.
Was lost and is found."
Them's my boys.
Is there a man among you
who'd offer his son a stone...
...when he asks for bread?
A snake, if he asks for fish?
If you, then, mad as you are...
...now know how to give your children
what is good for them...
...how much more will
your Heavenly Father...
...give good things...
...to those who ask for them?
Treat others as you would have
them treat you.
Well, that is the Law
and the prophets.
The Law and the prophets,
the Law and the prophets.
You are the light of the world.
You are the light of the world
But if that light is under a bushel
it's lost something kind of crucial
You've got to stay bright
To be the light of the world
You are the salt of the earth
You are the salt of the earth
But if that salt has lost its flavor
it ain't got much in its favor
You can't have that fault
And be the salt of the earth
So let your light soul shine
before men
Let your light soul shine
So that they might know
Some kindness again
We all need help to feel fine
Let's have some wine!
You are the city of God
You are the city of God
But if that city's on a hill
it's kind of hard to hide it well
You've got to stay pretty
In the city of God
So let your light soul shine
before men
Let your light soul shine
So that they might know
Some kindness again
We all need help to feel fine
Let's have some wine!
You are the light of the world
You are the light of the world
But the tallest candlestick
Ain't much good without a wick
You've got to live right
To be the light of the world
Stroke!
Stroke!
Stop!
This is the beginning.
By whose authority...
...are you acting like this?
Who gave you this authority?
I have a question to ask you.
The baptism of John,
was it from God or from man?
If we say from God, he will say,
"Then why did you not believe?"
But if we say from men,
the people will be angry...
...for they took John as a prophet.
We do not know.
Then neither will I tell you
by whose authority I act.
Stop!
Now, we know you are an honest man.
Give us your ruling on this :
Are we or are we not permitted...
...to pay taxes to the Roman emperor?
Why, you hypocrites!
Show me the money
in which the tax is paid.
Whose head is on here,
whose inscription?
Caesar's.
Well then, pay Caesar
what is due Caesar...
...but pay God what is due God.
What is the greatest commandment...
...of them all?
"Thou shalt love the Lord your God
with all your heart and all your soul."
This is the greatest commandment
of them all.
And the second is like it:
"Thou shalt love thy neighbor
as thyself."
All the rest of the Law and
what the prophets have written...
...is based on these first two.
You doctors of the Law
and you Pharisees...
...sit in the chair of Moses.
But you say one thing
and you do another.
Everything you do is done for show.
You like to have your places of honor
at feasts and in the synagogues...
...and to be greeted respectfully
and to be called "teacher."
But you must not
be called "teacher."
For you have one teacher:
the Messiah.
And you must not call
any man on earth "Father."
For you have one Father,
and you are all brothers.
Alas, for you lawyers and Pharisees
Hypocrites that you be
Searching for souls
And fools to forsake them
You travel the land
You scour the sea
Then when you've got your converts
You make them twice as fit for Hell
As you are yourselves
Alas! For you lawyers and Pharisees
Hypocrites that you are
Sure that the kingdom of Heaven
Awaits you
You will not venture half so far
Other men who might enter the gates
You keep from passing through
Drag them down with you
You snakes, you viper's brew
You cannot escape being devil's food
I send you prophets
And I send you preachers
Sages in rages and ages of teachers
Nothing can mar your mood
Blind guide
Blind fools
The blood you've spilt
On you will fall
This nation
This generation
Will bear the guilt of it all
Alas, alas, alas! For you
Blind fools!
Oh, Jerusalem!
Jerusalem...
City that stones the prophets and
murders the messengers sent to her.
How often have I longed
to gather your children...
...as a hen gathers her brood
under her wings?
But you would not let me.
And so I tell you...
...you shall never see me
until the time when you say:
"Blessing on Him who comes
in the name of the Lord."
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Can you take me with you?
For my hand is cold
And needs warmth
Where are you going?
Far beyond where the horizon lies
Where the horizon lies
And the land sinks into
Mellow blueness
Oh please
Take me with you
Let me skip the road with you
I can dare myself
I can dare myself
I'll put a pebble
In my shoe
And watch me walk
I can walk and walk
I shall call the pebble Dare
We will talk together
About walking
Dare shall be carried
And when we both have had enough
I will take him from my shoe singing
Meet your new road
Then I'll take...
...your hand
Finally glad
That you are here
By my side
Then the man they called
Judas Iscariot...
...went to the chief priests
and said:
What will you give me
to betray him to you?
They paid him 30 pieces of silver.
And from that moment, he began
to look out for an opportunity...
...to betray him.
By my side
By my side
That you are here
By my side
Come sing me sweet rejoicing
Come sing me love
We're not afraid of voicing
All the things
We're dreaming of
Oh, high and low
And everywhere we go
We can build
A beautiful city
Yes we can
Yes we can
We can build
A beautiful city
Call it out
And call it the City of Man
We don't need alabaster
We don't need chrome
We've got our special plaster
Take my hand
I'll take you home
We see nations rise
In each other's eyes
We can build
A beautiful city
Yes we can
Yes we can
We can build
A beautiful city
Call it out
And call it the City of Man
Come sing me sweet rejoicing
Come sing me love
We're not afraid of voicing
All the things
We're dreaming of
Oh, high and low
And everywhere we go
We can build
A beautiful city
Yes we can
Yes we can
We can build
A beautiful city
Call it out
And call it
The City of Man
Come on!
Where?
- Okay, come on.
- Come here.
Sit next to me, okay?
Hey, that's you!
I tell you this :
One of you among us will betray me.
Could it be me, Lord?
How about me?
How about me?
Could it be me?
Could it be me?
Rabbi...
...can you mean me?
The words are yours.
Do quickly what you have to do.
Take this and eat.
Eat, for this is my body.
Take this and drink...
...for this is my blood.
The blood of the covenant,
shed for the forgiveness of sins.
And I tell you...
...I shall never again drink
from the fruit of the vine...
...until I drink it again with you
in the kingdom of my Father.
On the willows there
We hung up our lives
For our captors there...
...required
Of our songs
And our tormentors' mirth
On the willows there
We hung up our lives
For our captors there...
...required
Of our songs
And our tormentors' mirth
Saying...
...sing us one
Of the songs of Zion
Sing us one
Of the songs of Zion
Sing us one
Of the songs of Zion
But how can we sing
Sing the Lord's song
In a foreign land?
Stay here while
I go over there to pray.
My heart is ready
to break with grief.
Stop here...
...and stay awake with me.
On the willows there
We hung up our lives
Father...
...if it be possible...
...let this cup pass me by.
Yet not as I will...
...but as Thou wilt.
What?
Could none of you
stay awake with me one hour?
Stay awake and be spared the test.
The spirit is willing,
but the flesh is weak!
Everyone else may fall away
on your account.
But I never will.
I never will.
I tell you this!
Tonight, before the cock crows,
you'll betray me three times!
Father, if it be not possible
for this cup to pass me by...
...without my drinking from it...
...Thy...
...will...
...be done.
Man does not live by bread alone,
but on every word God utters.
If you are the Son of God,
throw yourself down.
Scriptures say,
"He will send angels to support you."
Thou shall not tempt
the Lord your God!
All these things I will give you...
...if you will pay me homage.
Be gone, Satan!
You shall do homage
to the Lord your God...
...and worship Him alone.
Friend...
...do quickly what you have to do.
Put down the sword! He who lives
by the sword dies by the sword.
Do you not suppose I could
appeal to my Father...
...who'd at once send
12 legions of angels?
Do you take me for a bandit...
...that you come after me
with swords and cudgels?
Daily I taught in the synagogue.
You didn't come after me then.
But all this has happened...
...to fulfill what the prophets
have written.
O God
I'm bleeding
O God
I'm bleeding
O God
You're bleeding
O God
I'm dying
O God
You're dying
O God
I'm dying
O God
I'm dead
O God
You're dead
O God
You're dead
O God
You're dead
Long live God
Long live God
Prepare ye
The way of the Lord
Prepare ye
The way of the Lord
Day by day
Day by day
O dear Lord
Three things I pray
To see Thee more clearly
Love Thee more dearly
Follow Thee more nearly
Day by day
