MAN: "There are more things
in Heaven and Earth, Horatio,
"than are dreamt of
in your philosophy."
This is United Nations reporter
Eric Carter with the news.
As the series of earthquakes
continue to destroy Chile,
the United Nations has granted
immediate emergency aid.
Transport planes laden with food
and medical supplies...
have already been dispatched
to the stricken area.
MAN: Through the facilities...
of the International
Communications Satellite,
we take you live
to Santiago de Chile,
and our U.N. reporter
Rodrigo Infanta.
Hello, Santiago.
This is Eric Carter in New York.
[Beeping]
INFANTA: Hello, Eric.
This is Rodrigo Infanta
reporting via I.C. S...
from the U.N. newsroom
in Santiago de Chile.
The planes have already arrived
and are being unloaded.
The last recorded tremor
was four hours ago.
Hopefully, it was the last.
I have a message from
the president of Chile,
conveying
his heartfelt thanks...
to the United Nations
and the Red Cross...
for their swift
and most excellent assistance.
Rodrigo Infanta
signing off from Santiago.
[Beeping]
Thank you, Rodrigo.
Considerable attention has been
focused on the Bering Sea.
A Japanese fishing fleet has
reported a strange phenomenon.
Large icebergs
have been breaking up,
the floes of which are drifting
southward towards Japan...
and melting quickly.
The Japan current,
sometimes called Kuroshio,
divides here.
The northern branch
skirts Asia...
and merges with
the cold Oyashia current.
This normally cold
ocean stream...
is maintaining
an abnormally warm temperature.
The United Nations...
has dispatched
its nuclear submarine Seahawk...
with several of the world's
most prominent scientists...
into the area.
More on that matter
as it arises.
Japanese scientist
Akiro Markino,
winner of last year's
Nobel Prize for medicine,
claims to have made
a rather amazing discovery...
in the field
of chemotherapy.
These red berries, discovered
in his latest field trip...
in the Bougainville area,
produce a non-habit-forming
narcotic effect.
Unfortunately, he reports,
the berries grow in only one
small, remote, primitive island,
and the natives there
are reluctant to give them up.
It seems animals
are fond of this fruit,
and the berries are ground
into juice by the natives...
to placate a "mysterious god"
who lives on the island.
The god is supposedly
an enormous creature...
that no one has ever seen...
but who is rumored to be taller
than many of their mountains.
Dr. Markino would make
no comment...
on whether such
a creature exists or not,
but the Pacific
Pharmaceutical Company,
Dr. Markino's employer,
claims he does exist.
They also claim that
the reason he is such a giant...
is because he eats
Dr. Markino's berries.
There is one thing
we can be certain of...
that these berries
will produce,
and that is a giant
advertising campaign.
MAN: I called the plant Summer.
Our early tests have shown
remarkably good results.
We are pleased.
My notes confirm this.
I will however need more berries
to continue testing.
But because of their god,
the natives refuse to give up
more than a few handfuls.
How strange.
Would you show us where
the island is on the chart?
MARKINO: Of course.
Of course.
Just before returning home,
I touched at Bougainville,
here in the Solomons,
and about 62 miles south...
was a small island
called Faro Island.
There is where I found the
red berries and the strange god.
Strange story, Mr. Markino.
I find it hard to believe...
Uhru. Sounds like
a fairy tale, Doctor.
Does a giant creature
exist here?
Since you ask my opinion,
my answer is yes.
A giant monster? Ha ha!
He must be putting us on.
We must really need publicity.
It's heads, so get a monster.
Tako, not a monster. Really.
Yes, a monster.
Come on, think.
I want action now
and no arguments.
A wonderful stunt!
Terrific!
Of course. Have you seen
our latest TV ratings?
They're terrible. Who out there
is watching our show?
No one! Because it's dull and
boring and without imagination.
Pacific Pharmaceutical
demands publicity.
You two are going to Faro.
Find me a genuine monster,
if he exists or not!
Steaks are ready.
Are you hungry?
Hungry? I'm starving.
I have something
to show you first.
Look at this.
Sewing machine thread.
This is wire,
stronger than steel.
Just watch this.
We're testing it
Monday in Hokkaido.
Hold it! Don't do that!
No, don't!
Stop! Stop! I'm convinced!
I'm convinced!
Don't do that! Come on, stop!
I believe you.
Stop it! You're not Tarzan!
All right, you win.
Come on, no more.
No more.
You should take some
with you on your expedition.
There is nothing stronger.
WOMAN: Here.
Hey, that's not fair.
What?
How come your boyfriend's steak
is bigger than your brother's?
Sakurai, stop it, will you?
Fujita, eat, honey.
I made the steak for you.
Hey, what's so interesting?
FUJITA: Story about
a submarine.
Submarine?
U.N. submarine Seahawk is
calling in from the Arctic Sea.
Hello, Seahawk.
Go ahead, Commander Roberts.
This is Commander Roberts
reporting from Seahawk.
We are approaching area
and will submerge shortly.
CARTER: Hello, Seahawk,
this is Eric Carter
from U.N. headquarters...
switching you now to
Yataka Omura in Tokyo.
Hello, Seahawk,
this is Tokyo.
Our tracking stations in Japan
are following you closely.
ROBERTS: Thank you.
Over and out.
We are following
the submarine Seahawk by I.C.S.
Her present location...
is latitude 58 degrees north,
longitude 178 degrees east.
Captain, water temperature
is 68 degrees.
ROBERTS: 68 degrees!
It can't be.
There aren't any warm currents
in the Arctic Ocean.
- Check that temperature!
- Yes, sir.
Captain, I see a strange light
behind the iceberg dead ahead.
ROBERTS: That must be it.
Let's go down and have a look.
Take her down fast.
Emergency dive.
[Horn sounds]
Doctor, what do
you make of that?
It looks like
a Challenkoff light.
Challenkoff light?
What can that be?
It's a light generating
nuclear reactors,
and that light looks
very much like it.
Captain, we're having
a Geiger response.
Stand by!
Depth at 85 meters!
Still heading
towards the iceberg.
We're getting closer.
Up underwater periscope.
[Thud]
Emergency lights.
[Alarm]
All stations report damage.
DOCTOR: What did we hit?
- It must be an iceberg.
- Iceberg?
MAN: Periscope out of order!
Atomic fuel room damaged!
[Thud]
Captain, propeller shafts
and engines badly damaged.
Engine room reports
repairs impossible.
ROBERTS: Oh, great.
Captain, do something before
we are crushed to death.
Fire mayday quarter signal.
Captain, the Geiger response
is climbing.
Captain, sonar's out of order.
I'm sure a rescue party
will come looking for us.
There's nothing we can do...
but wait and pray that
they see the mayday signal.
MAN: Water in the engine room.
Secure all the bulkheads.
MAN: Captain,
water in the tower!
ROBERTS: Secure the hatch!
MAN: Engine room
flooding rapidly.
Captain, do something!
Abandon ship! All hands,
prepare to abandon ship!
- Escape hatch is jammed.
- Captain, we're trapped!
Look there, Al, in the water.
I'll mark her
around the iceberg.
That's them. Let's go down.
What do you make of that, Al?
[Roar]
Godzilla!
[Roar]
The world is stunned
to discover...
that prehistoric creatures
exist in the 20th century.
Tracking stations show...
Godzilla heading in
a southeasterly direction...
towards the offshore
islands of Japan.
He seems to be traveling
in a straight line...
and on a predetermined course,
though as yet we have
no explanation why.
Dr. Kenji Shigezawa,
minister of defense,
has been meeting with
the army chiefs of staff.
The armies have been alerted...
as we wait for more news
from Japan.
- Dr. Shigezawa, a statement.
- Is Godzilla coming?
Yes, he is.
He is approaching quickly.
- Can we stop him?
- We must not panic.
If there is one thing
we cannot afford at this time,
it is hysteria.
A national emergency may exist,
but the armed forces will defend
Japan at all costs.
That's really all
I can tell you now. Good day.
MAN: What if the army
can't stop him?
Of course, other plans
are now being considered.
Any way we can find to stop
Godzilla must be considered.
I see. Then you have discussed
using the atom bomb.
Possibly, as a last resort.
If we do not destroy
Godzilla soon,
the monster will destroy us all.
Gentlemen, that's all I can
tell you for now. Good day.

[Roar]
Yataka Omura from Tokyo,
reporting that
the situation is grim.
Evacuation plans
are being prepared.
People should have
small, light baggage ready.
Please remain calm.
The Japanese navy is filling the
harbors with evacuation craft,
and we wait to see...
in which direction Godzilla
will strike next.
Oh! No more!
I'm sick of Godzilla!
Send a wire immediately!
Oh, yes, right away, sir.
I want my own monster!
Find me a monster fast!
That's exactly 10 words, sir.
Send it! Send it!
[Horn sounds]
Land ho!
- Land ho!
- Come on!
There it is!
Land off the starboard bow!
Faro Island!
[Rhythmic drumming,
chanting]
[Shouting in native language]
[Shouting in native language]
[Rattling]
[Shouting in native language]
Good luck.
- Thanks.
- We'll need it.
Shove off.
UHRU: Sakurai, I am scared.
Why? It looks like
a friendly sort of island.
Ooh... ooh... do you
suppose they know?
[Shouting in native language]
UHRU: Hey, don't point
those things. We bring peace.
Presents for you! Don't shove.
Please don't push.
Wait a minute!
He brought me here.
Him! Him! He's the leader!
[Shouting in native language]
- Chief?
- Is that the chief?
That's the chief.
Konno, listen. We're here
on a goodwill mission. Got it?
I'm not here
to become their dinner.
[Speaking native language]
Well?
He order you to leave
this place. Right now!
UHRU: He's right. Let's go.
Hold it. Will you just
take it easy and calm down?
Listen, we want
the chief to know...
we came here as his friends.
Tell him a boat
is coming for us tomorrow...
and smile, will you?
I smile!
[Speaking native language]
Here, hold this.
Konno, give me the radio.
Come on, hurry. Hurry.
Chief. How.
See what I've got? Magic.
Try it out.
[Speaking native language]
This radio... two transistors.
I show you.
With this here, all other
chiefs will shake in your power.
CHIEF: Shake.
Shake. Tremble.
[Chief speaks
native language]
See, switch it on, like this,
and you get my magic.
[Music plays]
[Woman singing in Japanese]
Heh heh heh.
[Laughter]
SAKURAl: Quick, the smokes.
Cigarettes? Inhale!
Inhale.
They satisfy.
Ah, too bad.
We forgot to bring candy.
Oh, your mommy.
You better not
smoke it around home.
- Think it's all right?
- It's OK.
They're all smoking.
[Speaking native language]
He gives you
permission to stay.
But he will not
be responsible...
if the giant god comes down from
the mountains and eats you up.
Fair enough.
Sakurai, maybe we can
still catch the boat.
Forget it, will you?
Konno, give these to the chief.
Tell him to keep
the pack. Hurry.
[Thunder]
[Screaming]
[Drumming and chanting]
[Thunder]
Big spirit! Big spirit!
Pray! Pray!
SAKURAl: What was that?
[Chanting]
[Thunder]
Hey, that noise is only
the lightning up there.
That ferocious god of theirs...
is only lightning caused by
the thunderclouds.
You can't be scared of that.
Look at them...
ignorant, primitive savages,
frightened to death by
lightning up in the sky,
and you're no better!
[Animal roars]
Hear that?
That thunder ain't thunder.
Yes, yes, it is thunder.
That's ridiculous.
Just in case,
let us pray, too.
I don't believe
in superstition. You pray.
Fumiko! Fumiko!
Hi, Tamiye. What's wrong?
Fumiko,
Fujita's plane crashed.
It's in the papers.
"Flight 311X to Hokkaido
crashes."
"Tragedy struck
Hokkaido Airport today.
"In addition to the crew,
118 passengers died on board.
"27 survived."
Maybe he could be
one of the survivors.
Why don't you go to Hokkaido?
Do not go to Hokkaido.
The Japanese government
has asked me...
to inform all people
they have good reason...
to believe Godzilla
will strike next at Hokkaido.
WOMAN: Mr. Carter.
I see Eric Carter is ready with
Dr. Arnold Johnson in New York.
Go ahead, New York.
Thank you, Japan.
This is Eric Carter in New York.
Dr. Arnold Johnson
is curator...
of the New York
Museum for Natural History...
and an esteemed authority
on prehistoric animals.
Dr. Johnson, you've agreed
to explain to us...
some of Godzilla's history.
I said I would
attempt to explain.
After examining photographs
of Godzilla taken by the I.C.S.,
I tend to classify him as a
prehistoric species of dinosaur,
possibly a cross between the
gigantic Tyrannosaurus Rex...
and the Stegosaurus,
which is sometimes known
as the plated dinosaur.
This particular form
of reptile existed...
somewhere between
97 and 125 million years ago.
That's an impossibly long time
for anything to remain alive,
even frozen
inside an iceberg.
Well, in Mexico,
they found a frog...
which they think lay dormant
for two million years.
In Japan, flowers bloomed
recently from lotus seeds...
3,000 years old.
The fact that Godzilla
is here and alive,
forces us to reconsider many
theories on suspended animation.
Dr. Johnson, you stated Godzilla
would definitely come to Japan.
What makes you believe this?
Fossils found in Japan
resemble Godzilla.
Also, he headed
instinctively for Japan,
like a salmon returning to
the waters in which he was born.
It's my opinion Godzilla
thinks he's heading home.
Our modern weapons seem to have
no effect on Godzilla.
Have you any suggestions
as to how he can be stopped?
Well, I know the atom bomb
is being considered,
but that would be
more destructive than Godzilla.
As a reptile, Godzilla might
shy away from electricity.
But at this time I wouldn't care
to hazard a guess.
CARTER: Thank you, Dr. Johnson.
Dr. Johnson has consented to
stand by at U.N. headquarters...
and keep himself available
for comment and consultation.
As you know, the U.N. newsroom
will remain open...
to keep the world informed
on the crisis.
Meanwhile, the expedition
dispatched by...
Tokyo Television and Pacific
Pharmaceutical reports that...
they heard the cries of a giant
creature on Faro Island.
They are now moving into the
interior to establish contact...
with this strange island god.
It is hoped he will be friendly.
UHRU: Hey, wait for me!
Where are you?
[Whistles]
[Birds chirping]
[Sakurai, speaking
native language]
UHRU: Wait for me!
SAKURAl: Come on, keep up.
UHRU: I'm tired.
Can't we rest?
No. We'll keep
going until dark.
Who says?
I says, and if you don't like
it, you can go back to camp.
OK, OK, but my corns hurt.
Ah, you and your corn.
My corns always hurt
when they're near a monster.
Great. When you
and the monster meet,
tell him all about
your corn problems.
- I heard something!
- Quiet!
[Speaking native language]
Konno, bring up my camera!
[Thunder]
[Animal squealing]
UHRU: Aah! He got me!
Aah! Ooh!
It's only a lizard.
Throw it! Throw it down!
[Lizard squealing]
[Animal roars]
[Roaring]
SAKURAl: Hurry!
We'll get trapped!
UHRU: You see?
My corns never lie.
[Chanting]
Uhru, what is it? What hurts?
The... corns.
I don't want to hear about
your corns till we finish!
After that, you and your corns
can go home.
Mr. Uhru must need sleep.
Get red berry juice. Hurry.
Good idea.
Kiro!
Kiro!
Kiro!
Kiro!
Kiro. Kiro.
Kiro!
Kiro.
[Speaking native language]
Aah!
[Shouting]
- What's the matter?
- Giant octopus. Hurry.
- What?
- He's after the berry juice.
Watch out. Stay back.
Get him back here.
Hurry. Come on, hurry.
[Screaming]
Do something!
They're still alive.
Hold it.
Here they come now.
[Animal roaring]
[Roaring]
[Roar]
[Roaring]
[Roar]
- He'll fall asleep.
- Shh.
[Thud]
[Thud]
[Chanting]
[Chanting becomes louder]
[Chanting continues]
Leave him here. Let's go.
Don't be stupid.
- Let's go home.
- We're going home.
Konno, we're going home!
- With Kong!
- With Kong?
Yoshiyo Tako
of Tokyo Television reports...
that the god of Faro Island,
an enormous gorilla
known as King Kong,
has been captured
and brought to Tokyo.
Mr. Tako claims ownership
for himself...
and the Pacific
Pharmaceutical Company...
and is flying out
to greet his expedition.
What about this, Dr. Johnson?
Legends of giant gorillas
have persisted for some time.
That Kong and Godzilla have
appeared at the same time...
is interesting scientifically.
Godzilla has a brain
about this size.
He is sheer brute force.
While Kong is
a thinking animal.
His brain is
considerably larger,
about 10 times the size
of this gorilla's skull.
Being instinctive rivals,
there's no doubt that they will
attempt to destroy one another.
But our latest reports show
that Godzilla has disappeared.
Keeping this in mind,
do you still believe
he will attack Japan?
I do.
Being amphibious,
Godzilla is probably lurking
in the ocean depths off Japan,
where the depths
go to about 20,000 fathoms.
He could be puzzled
at the changes taken place...
during his long sleep.
But I have no doubt that when
he decides to return to land,
he'll select Japan.
How does that sound in Tokyo?
Not very good.
The army is up to full strength,
and evacuation plans for
all cities are underway.
What about the arrival of Kong?
King Kong has the strength
to tear Tokyo apart...
with his bare hands.
The government has no intention
of giving him the chance.
It's Tako!
- Hi, Tako.
- Hi, boss.
Bonzai!
- Captain.
- Welcome aboard.
Boys, you did a wonderful job,
a wonderful job indeed.
Wonderful! Wonderful!
Ah, there! King Kong!
I think he's found a hero.
Ah! Hee hee!
UHRU: Stop!
SAKURAl:
Don't! That's dynamite!
Press that lever
and pow goes Kong.
- Pow?
- Don't you understand?
The raft's dynamite
is wired to that fuse.
Oh, boy. Hee hee.
Aah! Aah!
[Ship alarm]
- Are you the captain?
- I'm the captain.
Remain outside of Japanese
waters until further orders.
Who is going to be
responsible for King Kong?
I am. My company owns him.
I have government orders.
"King Kong is
not to enter Japan.
"Considered a menace,
"King Kong must be taken back
to Faro Island at once."
These orders are final.
My Kong?
Your orders are specific.
My contracts.
The TV commitments.
"Return Kong to Faro.
"Kong, considered a menace
to Japan, must be returned.
"If these orders are not obeyed,
"I have instructions...
"to place responsible parties
under arrest."
- Mr. Tako!
- Boss! Boss!
Fujita?
Hi.
What's wrong?
TAMIYE:
I thought you were dead.
Dead? Do I look dead to you?
Your airplane. It crashed.
I missed it.
The boss kept me working.
But Fumiko went looking
for you in Hokkaido.
Hokkaido?
Oh, what a mess I've made.
Are you going out?
- No. We're leaving the city.
- Why? Is something wrong?
- Godzilla.
- Really? Godzilla?
We just heard the late news
on the radio.
- Godzilla is near Hokkaido.
- Mommy, let's go see Godzilla.
We're not going to a zoo!
- Fumiko's train!
- It's the express.
[Train horn sounds]
WOMAN: I hope she isn't
bothering you.
I don't mind it.
Godzilla has risen from the sea
and is moving toward Hokkaido.
The eyes of the world
turn to Japan in this crisis.
REPORTER: The United Nations is
supporting defense preparations.
Each nation has pledged
soldiers and heavy weapons.
The main question is,
can they stop Godzilla?
REPORTER: General Shinzu,
in charge of Japan's defense,
has kept the emergency council
in all-night session.
SOLDIER: Our latest report
shows Godzilla nearing Hokkaido.
Excellency, we may need
the atom bomb.
I hope that this will be
our last resort.
Where is he now?
Sir, Godzilla was last position
was on the Hokkaido mainland,
in this area.
43 to control.
Godzilla is approaching.
He seems to be attracted
by the train lights.
[Roaring]
[Brakes squealing]
WOMAN: There, there.
GIRL: Mommy!
WOMAN: That's better
MAN ON P. A: Attention.
Godzilla is approaching.
WOMAN: Godzilla!
MAN: Please don't panic!
[People screaming]
[Roaring]
Hurry! Get in the trucks!
Get in! Let's go!
WOMAN: Wait for me! Please!
Wait! Wait! Wait for me!
MAN: Watch out! Out of my way!
OFFICER: Stop! Go back.
Go back!
My girlfriend's on that train.
- How many left behind?
- 14 or 15 more on the highway.
SOLDIER: OK. Move.
All right, keep it going.
Come on, come on.
Hey! Come back.
You'll be killed.
You'll be killed!
[Roaring]
Aah!
[Roaring]
Give me a ride!
Godzilla's coming!
Come back, you fool!
Fumiko? Fumiko!
- Are you all right?
- Fujita! Oh, my God!
[Growling]
[Whistle sounds]
- He's waking! Do something.
- What do you want me to do?
MAN: Yes, Captain?
- Cut that cable.
- Aye, sir.
Cut that cable!
- Oh, God!
- Let's hurry! The dynamite!
Dynamite? No!
There's no time to argue.
Destroy him!
King Kong is my responsibility.
You cannot destroy him.
- You dumbbell!
- Dumbbell?
King Kong could kill us all.
You wouldn't care.
Publicity's all you want.
Publicity!
No, no! Don't do it! No!
Leave it alone! No!
King Kong is mine! No!
Aah!
[King Kong growling]
Use your rifle.
Shoot the dynamite. Hurry!
Oh, no! No! No!
TAKO: Stop that!
[King Kong roaring]
King Kong is free
on the Japan mainland.
He has been sighted heading
in a northwesterly direction...
which seems to been in a path
meant to intercept Godzilla,
who is moving southward
toward Tokyo.
MAN ON RADIO:
The best explanation for this...
comes from Dr. Arnold Johnson
of America.
JOHNSON: King Kong, scenting
the presence of an enemy,
seems determined
to destroy Godzilla.
Thus a battle of the giants,
which may have taken place
millions of years ago,
may soon be recreated soon
on the Nasu plain.
Stop. Stop!
Pull over. This way.
OFFICER: Where are you going?
I'm with Tokyo Television
and Pacific Pharmaceutical.
King Kong is
under my sponsorship.
[Roar]
Get ready.
[Roar]
Ah, look. Here they come.
Pictures.
Get some pictures.
- I have to get a light check.
- Put my money on Kong.
I'll bet Kong
has no chance.
I'll toss you.
Heads for King Kong.
Tails.
Don't quit. Oh, that Kong.
He's chicken.
- Kong's fighting a flamethrower.
- Fight back! Bite him!
Kong has retreated.
Godzilla now reigns supreme,
and will, in all probability,
continue his march
towards Tokyo,
destroying everything
in his path as he goes.
The army has made plans
for the first line of defense.
These villages
have been evacuated.
The defense plans,
in a simplified form,
are to dig out an enormous pit
and line it with explosives...
and poison gas.
Riverbeds and canals
on each side of the pit...
will be filled with gasoline
and set on fire.
The fire should drive Godzilla
into the trap in the center,
where the explosives
can be detonated.
We're nearly through
with that section.
General Shinzo, Godzilla
reported in close vicinity.
SHINZO: He'll be here by night.
[Roar]
MAN ON P. A:
Godzilla is sighted!
Please work as quickly
as possible.
Get that dynamite ready.
Open valves! Release gasoline!
Valves open, gasoline released.
[Roars]
Godzilla approaching.
Light torches.
Wait for your signal.
Release torches!
[Roaring]
[Roaring]
Stand by.
[Roaring]
- Fire!
- Fire!
Go back! He's alive!
[Roars]
Godzilla has crossed
the first line of defense.
He seems indestructible.
On the advice of Dr. Johnson,
a blockade of
high-tension wires...
containing one million volts
of electricity...
is being hastily linked
around Tokyo.
It was observed in his attack
on the train at Hokkaido...
that he moved away from
the wires whenever possible.
Yet, Dr. Johnson,
you have stated that King Kong
grows stronger from electricity.
Yes. For some reason
we do not yet understand,
Kong draws strength
from electric voltage.
Then if the electric blockade
stopped Godzilla,
it would not stop Kong.
No, it would not.
Thank you, Dr. Johnson.
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but we're switching now
to the northwest perimeter,
where Premier Shigezawa has gone
to inspect the blockade.
OMURA: All thoughts here
are centered...
on repulsing Godzilla
and saving Tokyo...
and over 10 million people
from certain death.
The blockade is ready.
The only question is,
will it work?
[Godzilla roaring]
Godzilla!
Connect tension.
[Roaring]
It's working.
- Where's General Shinzo?
- Up ahead.
General!
- Kong approaching Tokyo.
- King Kong?
[Roaring]
[Sirens]
[Screaming]
[Ship horn sounds]
What? We'll be right over.
MAN ON RADIO: King Kong
approaching electrical blockade.
All civilians evacuate
immediately.
[Yelling]
[Sirens]
[Kong roaring]
Attention! General Shinzo.
There he is, General.
[Electrical crackling]
[Whistles sounding]
[Sirens]
MAN ON RADIO:
King Kong has entered Tokyo.
We'd better leave tonight.
RADIO: Ships in harbor are
waiting to evacuate civilians.
King Kong has entered Tokyo.
All civilians evacuate
immediately.
- I won't leave you!
- Get going!
- Sir, what about the atom bomb?
- I'm not ready to discuss it.
- But it's our only chance.
- We hope it is not.
Why not?
Because we're not anxious
to destroy Tokyo, that's why.
MAN: What can you tell us?
SECOND MAN: Tell us something!
There is nothing more to say.
The atom bomb is ready
and waiting,
but first we must evacuate Tokyo
and perhaps all Japan.

Fujita! Fujita!

FUMIKO: Put me down!
Put me down!
Put me down!
Put me down!

Oh, no!
Help! Put me down!
Put me down!
Put me down!

Hit him with the lights!
General, the guns are ready,
but they won't stop him.
King Kong will only
become angrier.
Soldier, I'm in charge.
You listen to me.
Attention all gun batteries.
Attention all gun batteries.
Stop! Stop! Listen, you can't
start shooting at Kong now.
He's holding my sister
in his hand.
- Hold your fire.
- Yes, sir. Hold fire!
SHINZO: I can see her.
She's alive, but we can't
hold our fire for long.
King Kong must not
be allowed to escape.
[Sirens]
Let her go. Put her down!
You ugly monster! Let her go!
- What'll we do?
- I know.
- What's that?
- Get my drums. Right away.
- I can stop him, sir.
- You can?
Yes. I'm sure we can
put him to sleep.
Soma! A perfect idea.
We can explode it from above.
Hey, that's right!
You have the berry juice put
inside the head of a rocket.
The exploding fumes
will put him to sleep.
TAKO: Ovashi!
OVASHI: Yes, sir?
TAKO: Get the soma.
OVASHI: Yes, sir.
You can't do that!
Fumiko's up there.
Don't worry.
It's all going to work out.
Tako, I hope we're right.
King Kong can't make
a monkey out of us.
[Kong roaring]
[Sirens]
[Helicopter whirring]
- Easy with that stuff!
- Get those loudspeakers up.
- Let's have that microphone.
- Easy!
Get that sound tape ready.
- What if it doesn't work?
- It's got to work.
Keep your fingers crossed.
I'm gonna go.
[Blows on hands]
- OK, ready.
- Good.
Ready here.
Ready! Fire one! Fire two!
[Helicopter whirring]
[Plays drums]
[Grunting]
[Chanting over P.A.]
Wait!
Go on.
[Crash]
Help out. My arms are tired.
Oh! She's free!
He's got her. Go!
[Helicopter whirring]
Fumiko!
Fumiko! Are you
all right, Fumiko?
Fumiko!
- Sakurai!
- How do you feel?
- Fujita!
- I'm here, dear.
There's the ambulance.
- Take her this way. Easy, now.
- Careful.
[Helicopter whirring]

[Cameras clicking]
CROWD: Congratulations, fellas.
Wonderful! Great!
Nice! Good job!
Congratulations.
Congratulations, men.
Sir, Godzilla's at Mount Fuji.
Gentlemen, our blockade
cannot last forever.
We must act.
The atomic bomb is
out of the question.
Our only chance is somehow
to bring them together.
Kong versus Godzilla.
If we are lucky, both will die.
Both will die?
But how can we move him?
General, an airlift
with balloons.
Fujita, your wire
will hold Kong, won't it?
Sure! Let us try.
- All right.
- Good. Let's go.
[Helicopter whirring]
MAN: Move those cables.
Turn on the helium.
- More helium!
- Move quickly! Go!
Hurry!
Whenever you're ready.
Kong's ready.
Sir, Operation Kong is ready.
- Proceed.
- Take him up.
- Hey, look at that!
- What's going on?
[All talking at once]
That wire of yours is great.
It's holding him.
Great publicity, huh?
How soon do you figure
we'll be there?
- By morning.
- Good.
Faster! Faster!
[Growls]
Look. Kong's waking up.
There's Godzilla. Look below.
[Godzilla roaring]
[Roars]
[Roars]
OK, drop him.
[Gunfire]
[Godzilla roaring]
Oh, look at that!
FUJITA: I can't tell
who's winning. Can you?
Not yet. Kong, hold his tail!
[Crash]
[Roaring]
[Growls]
[Roars]
[Thunder]
[Heavy blows]
Oh! Godzilla is
roasting King Kong.
PILOT: Electrical storm
up ahead of us, sir.
Lightning bolts.
Kong has a chance.
Electricity makes him stronger.
Now watch.
- Electricity makes him stronger?
- Uh-huh.
[Roaring]
[Electrical crackling]
[Roaring]
[Roaring]
[Electrical crackling]
Hey, look at them go!
[Rumbling]
- What's that?
- Earthquake!
Earthquake?
Look!
Kong is swimming safely
out to sea. No Godzilla.
That's wonderful!
I hope we've seen the last
of them for a long time.
Godzilla has disappeared
without a trace.
As for King Kong,
our communications satellite
is following him.
And strangely enough,
we wish him luck...
on his long, long journey home.
[Kong roaring]
