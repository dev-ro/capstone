When will you race me?
If you can defeat all the 
racers from Qun Ma Mountain
I will race you.
All those mountain roads...
All those roads in Japan...
Starting tomorrow,
You start with the South, I'll start with the North.
We'll race different racers.
We'll see who wins more.
How's that sound?
Didn't you want to do it on the race track?
Race track?
Mountains are more fun.
I'm back.
What time is it?
My lovely wife¡­
Change my underwear for me.
Bastard!
Why would you steal my underwear?
Where are you going?
To the school.
School?
Isn't it summer vacation?
God knows where you go everyday.
Wow, women's underwear.
Do you know what a god is?
God is human too.
Except he did something that humans can't do.
So he became God.
A year ago that principal 
bitch kicked me out of school.
She said to me,
"Don't call yourself Itsuki."
"Why don't you try 'trash.'"
Then I thought,
I want the whole world to know that
I, Itsuki, am not trash.
I want to be a racer.
It took me only one year
to become the racer god.
The leader of SPEEDSTARS.
Haven't you had your license for just one year?
That's why I'm such a genius.
It's pretty easy.
Take turning for example
When you're about to turn,
just pull the e-brake.
So what?
So that you can be awesome!
But...wouldn't the car be slower that way?
Then you tell me how to turn.
At full speed
When you turn, don't be too slow.
Then you turn back...go on with your race...
You'd kill yourself like that!
Forget it. I don't blame you.
We got our licenses together,
but you haven't touched the steering wheel so far.
So, why don't you join my team?
I don't have a car.
You don't need a car.
You are here to wash our cars.
Just think about it:
I drive, you wash. What a bright future!
Come on, bro. Bottoms up!
Milk is good.
Why?
It's got calcium and protein.
And what's more important,
it can brighten the eyes.
What's the most important body part 
to a racer? The eyes!
You want to go to the movies?
Sure.
I can't go, I have to work.
Then we are going without you.
Hey, what are you doing?
Grade Two, Class B.
White today for Natsuki.
Funny.
Why do you look so nervous?
Do you know her?
No.
No? I heard you fought 
with another student last week
for her.
Let's go to work.
Yeah, I'll go get the money too.
Ok, let's go to work.
Are those your classmates?
Yeah.
They don't seem that good.
Racers.
No, they just work at the gas station after school.
They work really hard,
but only get paid 100,000.
The money I gave you last time 
might have been too little.
Thank you for taking care of me a
nd my mom for such a long time.
We don't need that much.
You are a good girl.
That's what you deserve.
I don't know what kind of dad you are.
You can't even give me a million.
I'm worried about you. That no one will 
be here to help you in your last years.
I will do great in my last years.
How come?
What if I don't take care of you
after I win the world championship?
You'll be miserable.
I'd still have the gas station.
Boss, take the money.
After you die, the gas station 
will be mine anyway. Right?
Thanks.
I'll pay you back, okay?
Pay me back?
Let alone the money I spent raising you.
You owe me 8,635,000 HKD.
Pay me back?
What have you done, world champion?
I don't get it.
Welcome, mister.
What kind of gas would you like?
May I ask if your boss is the racer god?
Sorry, never heard of him.
You bastard.
Check it out.
This is what I call a car.
Big tail, nice wheels.
Wow, a sports car steering wheel!
How much does it cost?
May I ask if this gentleman is the racer god?
I am.
But the racer god should be the boss here.
You are right.
I'll be the boss after he dies in a few years.
Child abuse.
God forbid!
I'm sorry, we are actually from Miao Yi.
NIGHT KID Team.
I'm Takeshi Nakazato.
I'm here to race the racer god.
We don't have a god here.
If you are looking for gods,
there's a pretty effective temple.
Whatever. I'll be waiting for you at the mountain.
Wash your cars.
We are going to the mountain tonight.
How many times have you won?
How about you?
Me too.
Who are you racing later?
Why don't we race a little beforehand?
So many people here.
Are you ok?
Don't worry.
I'll go all out.
I'll have to be at home by 3 o'clock.
You know my dad.
Don't worry.
Why? Are you worried?
Look, they have so many people.
Hurry up.
I'll have to send my friend home.
You want to race me with a person in your car?
Why not?
He doesn't seem to know anything.
If so, why don't I ride with you tonight?
Oh, you came together.
Then I should have gone home.
Fatty, we start here. We'll see who's 
the first to reach the parking lot.
The first one to get there is the winner.
Or else the second-place wins?
He really doesn't know anything.
Pass the first turn.
That car is right on our tail.
He's a real dummy.
What are you doing?
Calm down.
Pass him.
There's no risk at all.
I don't think that's necessary.
Look... look... forward.
What?
Look forward!
Look what you did.
I told you to stay calm.
You just can't calm down.
I told you I'll have you home on time.
Bastard.
What about you?
Who's puking? Who's the bastard now?
I think it's time for us to race.
Not yet.
Why?
You want the truth?
Yes.
I found something out after I took that ride in your car.
Your turns are too tight.
Don't you think so?
Even though your GTR is high-powered,
the front end is heavy.
There are lots of turns on the mountain.
You'll have to push the front 
end every time you make a turn.
Especially through the last five hairpins.
You can't make up your mind, either.
Unless you can get over this,
you can't compete with my FC.
Unless you can get over this,
you can't compete with my FC.
It's good that you're ok.
So you can still be the world champion.
I want to buy a GTR.
I'll buy you a Benz.
I want a GTR.
And a Rolex.
I want a GTR.
You almost lost your life last night.
If I would have been driving a GTR 
last night, it wouldn't be like this.
You'd be dead if you'd have been driving a GTR.
I want a GTR.
Welcome.
Can I help you?
You can't help me.
I'm looking for the fat racer god.
God.
What do you mean?
Are you laughing at me?
I lost to an AE86 last night.
He can use drifting to tackle corners.
He's really fast.
I only saw a tofu shop logo on his car.
Do you know him?
If you know him,
please tell him
I'll be waiting for him at the mountain
this Saturday night.
Takumi Fujiwara, is it you?
It's not me.
I was here last night.
The one who beat him last night
is the real racer god.
Don't tell me it's you.
Or my friend Wen Tai.
What did you say? Say it again.
I know it's unbelievable.
You wouldn't believe it's him either.
But that GTR person told me so in person.
What's so good about a GTR?
350 horsepower, 4 wheel drive.
Rigid bodywork,
classy styling.
So what?
Then you just have fun with him.
Okay?
It's so hot.
If you are wrong,
I'm going to kick your ass.
Welcome, how can I help you?
Fill it. Thanks.
Ok.
I'll go. Thank you.
Thank you. Bye
Takumi. Takumi. Takumi.
You said that's your favorite.
Actually, you got in a fight for me last time.
I'm really sorry.
I've been waiting to thank you.
But you won't talk to me 
when we see each other anymore.
I didn't... Because I'm afraid 
of those guys from school.
They will say...
I mean...
You mean people at school will talk about you and me...
Yes.
Yes what?
We've been in the same class from 
primary school to high school.
We used to tell each other everything.
But you won't talk to me lately.
I haven't talked to you in weeks.
Do you like it?
Yes.
Then, may I talk to you later?
Yes.
Actually, I have something important to tell you.
I bought a sexy swimsuit.
You promised me before the exams,
that you will drive me to the beach.
Did you forget?
Yes.
After you said that
I went to buy a swimsuit right away.
I looked for a long time, and I
finally bought the most revealing one.
What's that look for?
You're choking?
Are you ok?
Alright, alright.
Are you ok?
You scared me, just now.
Takumi.
Pick me up at the station this Sunday.
You promised.
Okay.
Im going.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Pick me up at the station this Sunday.
You promised.
Dad.
You beat that GTR, right?
Maybe.
Is he fast?
Fast at first.
But when he turns,
he becomes really slow.
You really think he's slow?
What are you trying to say?
Nothing, I'm just asking.
I bought a sexy swimsuit.
Will you use the car this Sunday?
Yes.
Is there a party
you want to go to?
No.
Bastard. So rude.
Tofu.
Tofu.
What? Gas leaks.
I have something to talk about.
Then what are you looking at me for?
So we can go to a fun place with women, of course.
Cheers.
Cheers.
What did I do for you to ask me out?
I thought you were mad at me because
I refuse to fill up at your gas station.
No, what I was angry at you because
you told people not to come to my station.
That's because your gas is more expensive.
That's because it's better.
Is this what you wanted to talk to me about?
No.
I didn't think you were still this good at your age.
Didn't you want me to show you something?
I'm talking about when you beat that GTR.
That wasn't me.
I haven't been delivered on the mountain in a long time.
But, all these years...
That was Takumi.
Takumi?
One night five years ago
my hemorrhoids were acting up.
Really big ones coming out,
damn it.
So, I told that bastard to deliver for me.
But he was only in middle school then.
So what?
At four o'clock in the mountain
it's too dark to see anything.
So, I let him drive.
At first, he left at four
and came back at half past five.
One year later
he came back at a quarter past five;
sometimes five.
And, two years later,
he came back at half past four.
Half an hour on the road for a delivery.
Now, it'll probably take him
four and a half minutes.
And he hasn't had one single accident?
Not exactly.
There was one time he was rushing home to get
some sleep. So, he got a little heavy on the gas.
Tofu was smashed.
Put that in there.
And don't spill any of it,
or don't bother coming back tonight.
Go.
At first, he needed two hours.
Later, an hour and a half.
A month later, one hour.
And then, half an hour.
I was getting tired of how 
much time he was using up.
Your son is really good.
So...
Ask him to race again that kid with the GTR.
The gas is on me.
You guys called me trash when I was young.
It turns out my son is more trashy than I am.
But you know what,
that's the only son I've got.
If there's something wrong with him,
get another one.
Tofu.
Hey, tofu.
How about that thing with the GTR?
Hey, who is going to pay the bill today?
Tofu, bastard.
Give me some scissors.
I bought a sexy swimsuit.
Boss, I'm thinking... This Sunday
I'd like to get away from it all a little.
What?
Dad, I made up my mind.
I don't want a GTR.
That's good.
Takumi's father was right.
If a racer falls,
he has to stand up by himself.
Dad.
Lend me your car to go to the mountain.
My car?
Don't call me your dad then.
Then what about mother?
How does this have anything 
to do with your mother?
If she knew where you went last night...
What do you think she would do?
Who are you looking for?
Tofu, you bastard.
You want my son dead.
Itsuki took my car.
Make sure that Takumi 
is going to the mountains tonight.
I'm busy right now.
I don't have time.
What is this?
It's the first time I ask you for something,
and you refuse me?
How are we going to deal with last night's bill?
What kind of tofu are you looking for?
19 years ago,
the fastest racer in town was
Bunta Fujiwara.
The amazing racer.
A lot of racers told me that
you are probably the first World Champion of Japan.
Unfortunately,
you chose marriage 19 years ago.
Selling tofu instead of racing.
Sometimes, one decision can change your life.
It's the same with racing,
and it's also the same with personality.
But there are always surprises.
You wouldn't have dreamt 
your wife would leave you.
That's right.
A racer should be angry.
I'd love to race you
for just one lap.
Sorry, we don't have what you are looking for.
Please go somewhere else.
Sorry.
Hey ,don't answer strangers' phone calls.
Hello.
Are you using the car tomorrow?
Go to the mountain tonight.
Beat that GTR.
If you do, Ill lend you the car on Sunday.
And fill the gas tank. I want it full.
Hello.
Tofu.
If Takumi beats that GTR tonight,
our bill is...
is...
All the cars that are going into the mountain
are being held up.
The roads are clear.
You can start racing anytime you want.
Racer god, don't joke with me.
You couldn't even make a turn last time,
and now you're driving this kind of car?
I'm worried you'll end up dead.
What do you care?
Do the roads belong to you?
You think you can block the mountain just by
using some people with head sets?
I'll call the police.
You're really not going to run?
I'll leave if you leave.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Hey, leave my car alone.
What are you doing?
Leave my car alone!
Get away from my car!
There's an AE86 coming into the mountain.
The real god is here.
Takumi's father.
Itsuki.
Takumi, what are you doing here?
Where's your dad?
Get out of here.
No, he asked me to come.
Why would you come here?
What are you doing here?
Delivering tofu?
No.
He asked me to race the GTR.
Don't make a fool of yourself.
You wouldn't even be able to make one turn.
If you race him,
you are dead.
Don't worry.
I've been driving this road for five years.
But you've only have your license for a year.
I already beat him once.
You are the one who beat me last time?
Yes.
Hey, tofu.
Tofu.
If Takumi wins tonight,
we are even.
Didn't I say so two hours ago?
What? Two hours ago?
That GTR is really fast.
Can Takumi beat him?
Every car you've had was more 
expensive and faster than mine.
But have you defeated me, idiot?
You are different.
You are crazy.
And my son is not?
Five, four, three -
Come on!
two, one, go!
Be careful.
But, that 86 is not very fast on straightaway.
It doesn't matter at the beginning.
Straights are fewer and fewer
towards the end.
That's when the kid will show his skill.
The high-powered GTR takes the lead.
The 86 can't keep up with it on the straights.
But it's getting closer in the turns.
That 86 is really stock.
I'm afraid he won't get near the GTR.
They're starting to hit the corners.
The 86 is getting closer.
The GTR is very accurate in the turns.
The 86 changed its line, it's starting to drift.
They are getting closer together in the turns.
The 86 is really good.
He's very fast in the corners.
The two cars hitting the turns neck to neck.
That idiot is really fast.
A couple of years ago
he told me he couldn't see things clearly.
I took him to the eye doctor,
but it turned out that his eyes were okay.
I told him "Hey, kid."
"Don't play games with me, 
or I'm going to kick your ass."
Lately, he's told me that
he sees things in slow-motion when he drives.
That's when I knew that it's 
because he's getting faster and faster.
This is where I lose to him last time.
This time, I must not lose.
I wouldn't believe it if I weren't seeing it with my 
own eyes. The 86 is running right alongside the GTR.
The 86 is trying to get ahead,
but the GTR is blocking his way.
You'll have to play by the rules.
Get back.
You want a piece of me?
Though the 86 can't pass him,
they are getting closer and closer.
The 86 is constantly trying to pass.
According to you,
Takumi will win for sure.
It all depends on the final five hairpins.
They are about to reach the final turns.
The 86 is still at full speed.
You can't take a turn at this kind of speed.
The 86 is getting faster in the turns.
The final five turns are left.
Will the GTR regain the lead?
The 86 is gaining a large lead.
His drifting is amazing.
The GTR is slowing down.
AE86 won.
Your skill is unique.
Weren't you at the mountain?
How did you make it down so fast?
I heard you use the gutter to turn.  Really?
I want to race you.
Do you have any time?
Sorry.
I only came here for my dad.
Maybe there won't be a next time.
Maybe you'll change your mind tomorrow.
Done.
I raised you.
You tried to look good for me.
Take me inside.
Pick my cigarette up.
Pick my cigarette up.
Hey, hurry up.
Oh.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
What are you wearing a towel for?
The sun is too bright.
Are you shy?
Oh, is it because I'm wearing a swimsuit?
How come?
Takumi, how come you 
have so many scars?
Those are..
From my dad.
He's been drinking every 
day since my mother left.
And he hits me every time 
he gets drunk. Is it ugly?
I think you are very charming.
You need a few scars to be a real man.
I hate those smooth-skinned sissies.
The one on your back is really cool.
That was three years ago.
This is last week's.
Does it hurt?
How about this one?
That's a mosquito bite.
You lied to me.
We're here.
Takumi, you drive really well.
I get sick every time I ride for a long distance.
But today I didn't.
That's a relief.
I had fun today.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Do you know what a god is?
God is human, too.
Only, he can do things that humans can't.
So, he becomes God.
God, please help me.
And my car, please.
Sit.
That's right, sit.
Get it clean.
Boss, is our champ crazy?
You got a new car.
What about him?
That's easy.
He's obviously in love.
What's wrong with you today?
You wouldn't understand.
How come?
You are a man.
If it's not money, then it's women.
What are you doing?
What?  You said you'll teach me how to drive.
When did I ever say that?
Leave me alone.
I'll go down at full speed.
Just give me one word.
I'm clever. One word will be 
enough for me to understand.
Let's go.
It's really fast.
Fastened your seat belt?
We have a car behind us.
Who drives so fast in the middle of the 
night? Are they hurrying back to bed?
Flash him.
Let him pass.
Why is he on my ass?
What?
I'm sorry. I thought you were 
the 86 from the tofu shop.
I was wrong.  This looks like... trash.
My little friend,
don't be running around 
the mountain at this time.
Go back to bed.
I'm talking to you.
Wrapping his head up in the middle of 
the night. He must be crazy.
I think he's going into the mountain too.
Trash will always be trash.
Move.
What do you want?
Say something.
He was trying to kill us.
Didn't you see?
So what?
He thinks you are trash.
It doesn't matter.
He can say whatever he likes.
Hey.
The car.
Hey.
The car.
Itsuki, why is your car so weird?
What do you mean?
The car doesn't feel right when turning.
The wheels seem to slide out. It feels 
like the car is about to flip over in every turn.
Then why are you still driving so fast?
I don't care.
I want to catch that bastard.
I want to go home.
Dad.
Dad.
Itsuki, are you okay?
Really, okay?
Okay.
Takumi.
How were you driving last night?
Sorry, boss.
I'll pay for Itsuki's car.
I'm not talking about this.
Did you know that
the racer from last night is from Empire Team?
That was a professional.
You want to defeat their 
Evolution with this crap?
Are you nuts?
But it's the same like the one at my house.
Like the one at your house?
Do you know how much 
effort your dad put into that car?
Suspension alone took him a month.
We bought this car
because that idiot was 
mislead.  He got cheated.
How's Itsuki?
How are you?
That champ is really no good.
He's been throwing up until now.
Who gets sick just by riding in a car?
Takumi, you are different.
You have a chance to become a 
good racer. Work hard.
What?
You're looking for money?
Did you really spend a 
month on the suspension?
That long.
Not only suspension.
I perfecetd the tires and the entire car.
Its height and balance.
Here and there,
A month passed.
Is it really that fun to be a racer?
Why? Do you want to be a racer?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Help me with the tofu if you don't know.
Your friend has been helping me all afternoon.
Friend?
I'm so sorry.
Never mind.
Uncle, have a cup of tea.
The tofu is done
and I made a snack.
Thanks.
You are welcome.
Takumi, you're back.
What are you doing here?
You want to know why?
You haven't called me since
 last time we went swimming.
So I came to see you.
Natsuki, is there a snack?
Yes, I'll bring it.
It really is different when 
there's a woman in the family.
And she wears a mini skirt.
If it were two inches shorter, it would be...
You should have told me.
I called you for several days.
But you were always at work or sleeping.
Uncle is kind.
How come?
He's been talking to me for a couple of days now.
He really loves you.
Did you know that?
You've been talking for a few days?
Big deal?
What did you talk about?
I'll tell you.
Uncle told me
about you wanting to become a racer.
I never said that.
And he said, if you work hard,
you will be a world-class racer.
I remember someone once told me
The most important thing 
in life is to find your own world.
As long as you find it, 
your life will have meaning.
Takumi,
I think racing is where you belong.
Who told you that?
Actually,
an uncle of mine told me that.
Uncle?
After my dad left,
Uncle has been taking 
care of me and my mom.
I thought you were talking about my dad.
I knew his word wouldn't be too meaningful.
By the way, Natsuki,
who's your uncle?
The most important thing 
in life is to find your own world.
As long as you find it, 
your life will have meaning.
If you work hard,
you will be a world-class racer.
Takumi, I think racing is where you belong.
Making a delivery this early?
Your car is broken.
Broken?
I'm tuning my car
Did you forget that I want to race you?
I didn't say yes.
Then I'll ask you again.
Yes or no?
I want to ask you.
Quakeproofing and tires.
Do they really take a month?
Are you interested in tuning a car?
Yes.
Let's talk about the engine first. The direct 
way to increase power is to raise the pressure.
But you'll have to watch the air, too.
And also the oil level.
Quakeproofing should be considered for body rigidity.
The angle between the tire and the road,
and the upper and lower friction angles.
The computer will record the information 
every run. You'll have to adjust it bit by bit.
Your dad is really good.
If I were the one to tune this car,
it would probably take me 6 months.
Your car has reached its peak performance level.
It is
impeccable.
I didn't know.
That drunk is really good at this.
But, every car has a limit.
I believe
this car will reach its limit soon.
You should get another one.
I'd still like my AE86.
Then, what about our race?
Three weeks from now.
Saturday.
Does it have to be that long from now?
Don't you need three weeks to tune your car?
Hey, that's him.
Got it.
Watch it, he's really fast.
He's an 86, isn't he?
Are you alright?
Damn, I forgot to tell you.
That car is for delivering tofu.
It can't be used for racing.
This is very dangerous.
Did you know that?
That's right.
You are professionals.
How can an amateur take us seriously?
How can an amateur take us seriously?
Professionals and amateurs are both racers.
And, by the way
you've beaten me before.
Do you still remember?
You want to go a second time?
Okay, call me. You know my number.
Hey, do you know if the AE87 came out?
The AE89 is the newest now.
Speak kindly. Don't hit him.
Hitting the child in a public place will have
a negative impact on his psychology.
Shut up.
Speak kindly. Don't hit him.
Hitting the child in a public place will have
a negative impact on his psychology.
I went home first.
I know you're stubborn.
That punk that beat you a few days ago.
I invited him to race in three weeks.
Please come.
If you need to, you can use my car.
Sorry, I only want to drive my car.
If you change your mind, call me.
You should try this.  It's delicious.
Natsuki brought it over to feed you.
What time was she here?
She said she'll be in the countryside for 
two weeks. She can't wait to see you again.
Did she say anything else?
She didn't.
Hey, hey.
You're going to go eat by yourself?  At least help me get up.
In fact, your AE86 is very incomplete and old.
It would cost more to rebuild the 
engine now than just to replace it.
So what would you think 
of swapping this engine in?
Great?
This engine was used in professional racing.
It's not street legal.
This is crazy.
Itsuki, are you chasing cockroaches?
No, I'm looking for my father.
He is like you. He disappears for days at a time.
There are customers.
This is miserable. These 
people are dozens of years old.
They don't have any responsibility. 
Leaving the business alone to me.
What if we go bankrupt due to oil prices?
At least I have myself to depend on.
Otherwise I'd be pretty bummed out.
What's the matter with the boss?
What's the matter with the boss? Get the 
Kleenex. Get the medicine oil. Help him out.
Uncle. What is the matter with you?
We wrapped up one lap on the mountain.
Where is he?
He'll come down soon.
Listening to the engine, you'd 
think the RPM's are very high.
But it's not enough speed to 
enter a corner.  It's too slow.
Get in the car.
I'll only do this once.
Pay attention.  Look out 
for the new shift point.
The horsepower of this engine doesn't 
stand out until above 11,000 RPM.
It's running smoothly.  Let's get on it.
Mei.
What do you think of my driving?
Not bad.
That's good.
I've been vomiting for two days now.
You've been taking care of me the entire time.
I really think you rescued me, just like God.
Bullshit.
I am serious.
I believe there is a spirit in this world.
But the God is composed of people.
Except there are things that 
people cannot do that he can.
So he has become God.
But there are some things you don't know.
Things which most people do. 
That God will have to do once in a while, too.
What are you trying to say?
Most people...
Will have to once in a while. Let's go to the 
hotel next to us, the Ruffian of Kazakhstan.
Since you are so gentle and considerate, 
you should be unable to refuse.
Pervert!
You, hey!
Natsuki.
What happened?
Did you know I went on a trial run with dad yesterday?
The new engine had a 
different tachometer originally.
I did not know that until yesterday.
Itsuki, AE86, 250 horsepower.
250 horsepower. Do you know how fast it is?
I was doing 150 kilometers/hr 
through the turns last night.
I was able to run the mountain 
track in under three minutes.
It's crazy.  Scary.
It's like I want to tell the whole world.  
Including you,
and Natsuki.
No need.
No need what?
No need to talk to Natsuki.
Takumi.
I have something important I 
want to tell my good friend.
Who?
You.
Say it.
I saw Natsuki.
Entering a hotel with a man.
A hotel.
Hotel.
Are you sure?
30,000 HKD to spend the night.
What did you say?
30,000 HKD to spend the night.
It's cheaper if you bring a friend.
You're a bullshitter.
You're not seeing things the way they are.
You hit me!  I feel like I want to die.
I've known you since we were seven.
And you hit me for a woman?
What are you two doing?
Stop!
Calm down.  Stop it.
Okay, stop it.
Stop hitting.
Why did you two fight?
Stop!
Don't hit...
Hey.
Why did you fight?
I hate you all!
Hey.
It's me.
I shouldn't have been talking 
about your girlfriend.  Sorry.
Forget about it. Today is Saturday.
Everyone is waiting for your AE86 and you.
Hey.
Hey.
It's me.
You've been trying to reach me?
I've been looking for you for a few days.
I went back to the countryside for a little while.
I'll be on a bus home soon. I'm at the train 
station. I should be back this evening.
My famous mountain race is tonight.
Come so you can see it yourself, okay?
No, I'll look for you tomorrow.
The train has arrived, bye.
Natsuki, I miss you.
Natsuki.
I've been so lucky to have you accompany 
me on these two weeks of vacation.
I don't know if the money I 
gave you last time was enough.
I would prefer that after this evening 
you would not contact me again.
I do not want to go on like this.
I do not want to see you 
and remember what we did.
I only want to be with Takumi now.
Let's not talk too much.  
The race will decide everything.
The race will decide everything.
It is very clear who the winner will be
in a race between Kyouichi and anyone else.
I am Kyouichi.  I will not 
be defeated by a person
two times.
This is horrible.
He will be injured because of me.
Don't say that.
You need to take care of yourself first.
You've had that nosebleed for a few days.
Look. Here it is again.
I just can't stop it.  
It comes every month naturally.
Isn't everyone here?  What are we waiting for?
Too impatient to wait?
Wait for him five more minutes.
Whether he comes or not is trivial.
I will be the one to test your strength this evening.
Starting to block the mountain pass. Starting to block 
the mountain pass. You can race in five minutes.
Wait a moment. There is 
a car coming up the hill.
It's the 86.  The 86 is coming.
This brings back memories of our 
racing days.  So many young women.
Oh yeah.
Hey, uncle, this is the woman-only special zone.
Go away.
It's coming.
The garbage truck came back to life.
Not bad, boys.
Why not show us that car of 
yours used for smashing into the mountain?
Boy, we spared you the first time.
No need for trouble. Let's hurry 
this up.  I've got things to do.
Wear this.
There's no need.
Ryousuke has something he 
wants to talk to you about.
Takumi, you heard Kyouichi 
is a professional driver.
But this professional 
has a bad temper.
You don't need to teach me anything.
I will certainly defeat him.
Then me afterwards?
I will do so just the same.
The mountain path has been sealed. 
The race can begin at any time
Repeat, the race can begin at any time
5,          4,          3,          2,          1,
Go!
All three cars launched very quickly.
Kyouichi's Evo III has taken the lead.
Ryousuke's FC follows behind.
Last is the AE86.
Through the first turn, 
Ryousuke and Takumi have set their fastest time.
The two professional drivers are leading.
Everybody is really fast.
What are you doing?
It's called tactics.
The FC lags behind unexpectedly in front of the tunnel.
It is not known what happened to Ryousuke.
Their speed is very high.
The past three turns were taken at over 100 KM/H.
The 86 is look for a chance to pass now.
Dont know if it can overtake the Evo III in the next curve.
Takumi, come on.
Give that to me.
What are you doing?
What are you doing? Watch the race.
Watch the race and make a scene.  Shout.
This is it.
They passed him.
The FC and AE86 pulled into the gutter 
at the same time and passed the Evo III.
I'll explain everything to you, young ladies.
Whenever a professional driver takes a right turn 
on a track, he intuitively
sticks to the left side so that his line can 
hit the apex.  This left open room for passing.
Go, Takumi!  Go, Takumi!
Now it's only us two, Takumi.
What about the Evo III?
I'll block him.
You take care of yourself.
The 86 and FC have unexpectedly 
overtaken the professional driver.
But the Evo III has not relaxed one bit.
Everybody's style is different.
The 86 and FC are drifting the corners too fast.
It seems the Evo III has 
a difficult time catching up.
Come on, Takumi!
Come on, Takumi!
Drivers pay attention.
Drivers pay attention.
A car just left from the outskirts of the park.
It's coming up the mountain.
Drivers please look out for 
the car and plan on slowing down.
It seems that Kyouichi did not hear the warning.
He tossed his headset.
Should we block him?
It is too late.
The Evo III has crashed.
The Evo III has crashed.
The 86 and FC have just avoided it.
Shit.
Keep going.
Is he okay?
Leave him alone.
Kyouichi.
Kyouichi, are you okay?
They're almost at the five hairpin curves.
This may be where the FC passes him.
The limit of the 86 has been reached. 
It's time for my FC to shine.
The FC finally passed the 86.
There is a kilometer of highway left.
It seems the 86 can not catch up.
Were you mistaken?
I have been expecting this.
You've expected this?
That boy is comparable to many 
inferior cars that don't often lead.
Ryousuke's car has so much more 
horsepower you would expect him to be ahead.
However, that does not ensure victory.
His defeat is not ensured?
That is uncertain.
You've been on this run a long while.
This is not only a trial of strength.
Remember,
you must keep in control of 
your emotions when racing.
Don't compare yourself to a professional.
If you want to win, be yourself.
The finish line is coming up quickly, 
but the 86 has not given up yet.
It's following the FC closely.
FC enters the corners and 
seems to have a perfect line.
Ryousuke is apparently not giving in 
to the pressure the 86 is putting on him.
The downfall comes from the tires.
Even if it can transfer the FC's 250 
horsepower, they are simply too big.
They are too wide for this racing. 
The tire is worn and torn terribly.
It doesn't have maximum grip.
This is the curve where the battle
 between the two will be decided.
It is here.
The finish line is rapidly approaching.
This is the last turn, a sharp left.  The FC's 
horsepower will certainly give it the advantage.
It seems the winner has already been decided.
But, the FC's entry speed seems slow.
The 86 cuts to the inside and drifts 
the gutter.  He can overtake him.
The 86 wins.
The 86 is the famous racer god of this mountain.
He won.
Hug me.
I have finally lost.
And now what?  Do you have a plan?
No. How about you?
I will organize a team of racers. 
Are you interested?
I don't think so.  Bye.
Takumi, I would really like to 
have you as part of my team.
Consider it.
Maybe.
Takumi.
Takumi.
Takumi.
What happened? Lost?
Hey. Hey!
Drink first.
That boy.
Itsuki, I'm sorry.
Hey, Ryousuke.
It's Takumi.
I want to join your team.
