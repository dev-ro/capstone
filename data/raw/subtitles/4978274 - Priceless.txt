JAMES: We're all
on a journey.
A road.
Full of delays, dead ends.
With bright
and beautiful views,
and storm clouds
and darkness, too.
It seems somewhere along the way
I took a wrong turn
that led me somewhere
I didn't wanna go.
And now,
I'm just trying to
find my way back.
So, I'll keep on driving.
Keep on searching.
This is my journey.
(INDISTINCT WEATHER FORECAST

In case you get thirsty
in the bathroom, huh?
No.
It's so don't nobody
steal the key.
Yeah, I mean...
I got that.
Hey...
You know what,
let me take one of these.
And, uh...
Put the rest
towards the tank.
What you hauling there, son?
Nothing.
Yeah? Guess I gotta get me some of
that nothing to start hauling, huh?
JAMES: It wasn't always
this way.
I was a good man once.
A father.
A husband.
But I lost the woman I loved,
and I have myself to blame.
And ever since,
it's been hard to keep going.
Keep a job.
So they came and they
took my little girl away.
And now
I'm a man in despair.
Desperation makes
you do funny things.
I told him I wouldn't
transport drugs.
He said,
"Don't ask, don't tell."
It was a simple job.
Just drive that truck.
Rain and hail or shine.
Straight through.
Those are their orders.
But what was I carrying?
And who was I meeting?
The questions haunted me.
I started hearing things,
seeing things.
I knew
something wasn't right.
And then it happened.
And I never
even saw it coming.

I called you.
You did. I see that.
When are you gonna
come see me?
Well, I've been thinking.
How about in two days?
Really?
Shh. I'm coming close
to Grandma's town.
I was thinking I'd drop by.
How's that sound?
You're my favorite
out of everyone.
I wanna live
with you again.
You're my favorite,
too, kiddo.
I want to live
with you as well.
Soon. Okay?
I love you, Daddy.
I love you, too,
and I miss you so much.
I miss you.

They think it would be better if you
went with Grandma for a little while.
But I want to

Please.
A cheeseburger, please.
And French fries.

Um... The same

Make that three.
The counter okay?
Yes.
Sure.
You both speak English?
This entire time?
Yes.

We have heard stories
of bad men in America.
We thought
Spanish would be safer.
We hope you understand.
Of course.
I am so hungry.

She's Maria?
You are...
Antonia.
And I'm James.
And you don't need to be

We want to thank you
for helping us
and for these
beautiful dresses.
You're welcome.
You're here
on purpose, right?
I mean,
you want to be here?
Mmm-hmm.
We are from Tenancingo.
In Mexico.
Our father owed
some local men some money.
We are sisters.
Yes.
Um...
We must work
to pay the debt.
Work?
Waitress, maid.
Big dreams, huh?
(CHUCKLES)
I want to be a singer.

Do you like
Taylor Swift?

I don't know about that.
No? You do not believe?
Went knocking a few times.
Turned out no one was home,
so I leave him alone
and he leaves me alone.
It makes me sad.
What makes you sad?
That you think we are alone.
We are never alone.
Alone's fine with me.
And what about
your daughter?
What about her?
She is not alone
because she has you,
even when
she cannot see you.
Sí?
I hope so.
It is the same.
I will pray for you.
Thanks, I guess.

show you something.
Hey, would you take a picture
of me in front of all this,
so I can send it
to my daughter?

What is her name?

I am a daughter

And I see a father

I hate to ask this,

Good.
How was your trip?
It was fine.
Okay, good.
Good. No bad weather?
No problems? No accidents?
No, I... I mean, I got run
off the road at one point,
but other than that
it was fine.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
You didn't get hurt
or nothing?
No.
The front of the truck
got a little beat up.
Ah, don't worry
about the front.
I don't worry about
the front of the truck.
It's just the cargo.
Very important.
Oh, that's good too.
It is?
With no lock, huh?
Hmm?
I'm kidding with you.
It's okay.
If it's okay, it's okay.

Go ahead, ladies, hop in.

You know who that goes to?
Yeah.

where are you taking them?
Not your problem.

What are you hauling?
Just cargo. Nothing...
Nothing, really.
You look beat.
Did you drive
straight through?
Yep.
Now why would you
have to go through all that
if you're hauling
a bunch of nothing?
I just need a room.
What do you think I'd find if I
opened up the back of that truck?
(DROPS PEN)
I don't know what
you're getting at.
I think you do.
Let's say we go have a look.
Let's say we don't,

off my property, right now.
What is it with you people?

It is no surprise, huh?
It means beautiful, um,

You two girls have boyfriends?
You have a boyfriend?
Nada? Nada?
But have you ever
had boyfriend, or no?
Sí.
CJ?
CJ: Yeah?
Okay.
This is why we are
very gentle with them,
and not moving around like
they are dogs or animals
because, uh...
They have something
very valuable, okay?
Yeah, I don't know
what I was thinking.
I beg your pardon,

I'll show you your room.
We go this way.

(JAMES SIGHS)
Shouldn't you be
headed back out?
Just trying to
have a drink, man.
Yeah, that always helps.
How did you know?
Box truck on
an overnight delivery?
Hauling cargo.
I would've called the cops
if they'd do a darn thing.
I just needed the cash.
I didn't know.
And... And it seemed
like an easy gig.
You looking
for sympathy?
Not here.
I need help.
What's that?
I need help.
Her and her sister.
I want to undo it, somehow.
Look, you obviously know
something about this.
Then help me.
(MAN SIGHS)
Help her.
I'm Dale.
James.
You still looking
for a place to stay?
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

You look good.
And these will
help you feel good.
Go on, take one.
No, thank you.
How's your sister
holding up?
I don't know.
This is too much for her.
It's too much for...
Anyone?
Yeah, I remember
being there.
Did your family
owe somebody moneys too?
(SCOFFS)
No.
No, I'm just
a regular idiot.
I got boyfriended.
You know?
I met a boy online,
blah, blah, blah.
So one day, um,
he sends me a plane ticket
to meet him in Vegas.
That first day was amazing.
But that night...
I guess he drugged me.
Um, I woke up in the back of
a van with a bunch of men.
I am so sorry.
It is what it is,
you know.
And Garo treats me way better
than my old man ever did, so...
I will pray for you.
Honey, you got a rough
couple of days coming up,
you should pray
for yourself.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Hey.
Morning.
Morning.
To be honest, I'm surprised
you're still here.
I figured you would've sobered
up and run home by now.
A little surprised myself.
Let's take a walk.
First things first, I need you
to get rid of that truck.
What do you want me
to do with it?
I don't care.
Just get it off
my lot.
If you need to go somewhere,
I got some bikes out back.
You can borrow one.
Do you ride?
It's been a while,
but, yeah.
Good. So what's your plan?
Go to the motel,
see what I can see.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

DALE: You all right?
I have one person
in this world
that I actually
mean something to.
She's already lost her mom.
And right now,
she's at home wondering
if her dad is gonna
show up like he promised.
And I'm not.
I'm not gonna make it.
Look, I should just forget
about all of this, right?
Get in the truck and go and wrap
my arms around my little girl.
You need to do
what you gotta do.
Being a father's the most
important job in the world.
Your daughter needs you.
All these girls have a
father that loved them, too.
So if you're hearing a little
voice that's telling you to stay,
that there's a larger
hand at play here,
then you might wanna
listen to that voice.
I'm not hearing any
magic voice, Dale.

You're just not listening.
Yet.

There's, um, something
going on around here.
What's the problem?
There's a motel.
Motel 12.
There's prostitution
happening.
Well, that's, uh,
serious, son.
How do you know this?
I saw it.
Just saw it?
Yes.
All right.

you if I have any questions?
I'm over at

Well, thank you
for the information.
Mind if I eat?
Of course.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Huh?
No, gracias.

and the least you could do
is try it for me.

But my friendship
comes at a cost.
Okay?
(SOFTLY) It's okay.

I cannot do this.
I am not supposed
to be here.
You play a game with me?
A juego?
No, no juego. No.
I will...
I will work to earn back
every penny that I owe.
But not like this.
You have my word,
but not like this, please.
Every girl in this house
wants to be on this bed. (WHIMPERS)
Mmm-hmm.
But I don't want the other
girls in this house.
I want you. Why?
Because I try to love you.
This is not love!
No?
This is not what
love looks like.
Then you choose what
love looks like, okay?
You decide.
I will have you and Maria.
No.
No?
CJ! Bring Maria, por favor!
She's just a girl!
Please!
No! No!
Sí.
No, no, no.
Por favor! Por favor!

it is my choice.

Uh, come on down to Motel 12,

me to come to Room 126.
I remember you.
What do you want?
I'm here to see
that girl I dropped off.
Can't stop thinking
about her, you know?
Yeah, well, she's not
on the menu yet, Romeo.
If you're serious,
I got other girls
just like her and
more eager to please.
I'm willing to pay.
I got money.
Oh, I know you got money
and plenty of it.
That's my man Garo's cash.
Not getting money back to the
proper hands is frowned upon.
I'm leaving tonight.
I just wanted to get
one in before I left.
Well, it's not gonna
happen with her, bro.
I'll give you a thousand.

what about that new girl?
'Cause this dude says
he's willing to pay.
Sí. How much?
He says
a thousand for the hour.
(INHALES SHARPLY)
You know?
I know you want to keep her,
but that's some solid money,
so I thought I'd ask.
She'll be there.
Okay.
Okay.

someone who was "priceless," sí?

JAMES: Antonia.
James.
What did they do to you?
I swear I didn't know any
of this was gonna happen.
How are you here?
I gave the man some money.
You, uh...
You paid to have sex with me?
No, no, no.
I paid to get you here.
(BREATHING SHAKILY)
How much am I worth?
Antonia.
Don't touch me.
I'm trying to help.
Don't you think
you've helped enough?
How could you just
leave us?
Did you not see what they were
when they brought out those girls?
I'm gonna make this right.
Although we don't
have much time.
I have a motorcycle
out the back.
We have to leave now.
Come with me.
No, I, uh... No.
My sister.
My sister. No, no...
We'll get your sister,
I promise,
but you have to
come with me now,
while there's still a chance.
No.
Antonia, please.
You don't understand!
If I leave,
Garo, he will hurt her.
With everything in me,
you have to trust me.
That word is broken
for you.
I will not leave Maria
in the hands of those men.
Here, I will stay.
Then I'll stay with you
for as long as I can.
Ah, what's this?
(SIGHS)
How are you?
I'm all right. Whatever.
I think we need to get her out.
GARO: Good, um...
Yeah, we will.
But let's be smart about it.
I don't wanna do it because right
now with her face like this.
She's so young. I don't want
the police in here, so...
How old are you, sweetie?
Sixteen.
Wow! So, like, high school.
Do you like school?
No.
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, me neither.
I hated it.
Good news is,
if you stick around,
I'll make sure you never have
to go back there again.
We take care of
each other here.
We're like family.
And you and your sister, you get
to be part of that family now.
Hey, I have an idea.
Why don't you come with me?
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Come on. Okay.
How about you go in and pick
out a really pretty dress.
Okay, we've got a whole
closet full in the back,
and then I'll help you do
your makeup and everything,
and then
you and me can take some
beautiful pictures of you.
It'll be fun.
Like a photo shoot?
Exactly.
Okay. Just sit down
on the bed.
Good. Good. Okay.

I let you sleep,

a little out of control.
No kidding.
I thought you were just going
to go see what you could see?
Yeah, and I saw an opening
to get Antonia back,
but she wouldn't go.
DALE: You need to
lay low for a bit.
You got a handful of people
on both sides of the law
coming after you right now.
Hey.
Why do you know
so much about this?

the flames of tragedy
can refine you,
burn off everything till you can
finally see what's important.
You know what I'm saying?
I think so.
Anyway, that's my story.
You got your own
story to worry about.
I wanna shut
this thing down.
Sounds like that little voice
telling you to do the right thing
just got a bit louder.
Welcome to the other side.
But you listen.
If you do this,
it's all-in, James.
You go down this road,
the things you'll see,
the things you'll do...
You can't go back
to normal life again.
It'll change you.

and his guys.
One of them
was banged up pretty bad.
I told the cop
where I was staying.
EMERSON: Daddy?
Daddy?
Grandma, he's not there!
(WHISPERING) Emerson?
Hey. Hey, sweetie,
I'm here.
I promise I'm here.
Hi, Daddy.
Hey, sweetie.
Hey, look, I'm so sorry I
didn't come to see you yet.
I, um...
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
What are you doing?
I love you.
You know that, right?
Tell me.
Tell me that you know that.
Why are you whispering?
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)
Hey.
I love you
more than anything.
I know. You already
said that, Daddy.
Hey!
Guys, you can't be banging on guest
room doors, disturbing folks.
I'm trying to run
a business here.
EMERSON: Daddy,
what's happening?
Are you still there?
Lo siento.
We're looking for our friend.
The one you haven't seen.
Like I said, he's not here.
Probably headed
back out of town.
But I don't remember
anybody saying anything
about him being
from out of town.
Look, you need to leave,
or I'll call the police.
There's no need for this
to get messy.
If it gets messy,
you're not gonna like it.
Let's go.
We'll see you soon.
Em? Hey. Are you there?
Emerson?
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Open the door.
It's Dale.
Get your stuff.
Where are we going?
My place.
(SIGHS) You hungry?
Yeah.
Here you go.
Some eggs
with a side of eggs.
Why are you
helping me like this?
I never get in the way of a man
trying to do something good.
I didn't set out
to do anything good.
I know you didn't.
But you can't help it.
That's what
makes it good.
Sometimes with
a little push
an ordinary man can do
extraordinary things.
I'm sorry.
Look, I gotta get back into town.
I gotta find those girls.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
Yep.
They'll be looking for you
on that bike though.
Can you drive?
Come on, man.
Hopefully better
than you can ride.
(CELL PHONE VIBRATES)
Yo.
CHAD: What do you think
you're doing, man?
Bro, you set me up.
No one set you up, James.
You said you didn't care
as long as it wasn't drugs,
and it wasn't.
These girls
don't belong to you.
Chad, those girls
don't belong to anyone.
Look, there are some bad dudes
who are gonna kill you.
Kill both of us, if you don't
give them their money!
We're talking about
a couple of whores.
They're worth more, man.
(HONKING HORN)
Hey.
I found the house.
Where?
Just a regular neighborhood.
All right, let's go.
You think they're already
out for the night?
I don't know.
I guess we're gonna have
to go in and find out.
JAMES: Are you serious?
DALE: Do you have
a better idea?
No.
You ever
shoot a gun before?
It's been a while, but...
It's kind of like
riding a bike, right?
No.
It's like shooting a gun.
I can't believe
we missed them by hours.
My guess is they're headed
to a new city.
Maybe even out of state.
So they're gone?
I'm sorry.
She wouldn't come with me.
I tried.
(SIGHS)
But she wouldn't come.
(DALE CLEARS THROAT)
DALE: James, come here!
Let's get out of here.
I want to show you something.
I come up here
to get some clarity.
Remind me of
the beauty of it all.
That cross.
I call it a God Shot.
Never heard of that.
It's when it feels
like everything is over.
When the last bit
of hope and light
starts slipping away faster
than you can chase it.
Then, boom!
Something appears.
Gives you strength
to carry on.
A God Shot.
Or it's just a necklace.
(CHUCKLES) Nope.
It's that little voice that you've
been hearing made physical.
I don't know what to do.
You know what to do.
It's too late.
It's never too late.
We were put here to
learn on this journey.
The pages of our story
are still being written.
But here's the good news.
We're not the author.
He has bigger plans.
You sound like Antonia.
With everything that
she's been through,
do you think
she still believes?
I know she does.
That's faith.
Hey, can you pull over?
Sure.
What's up?
I need to get some air.
(STAMMERS) I'll meet you
back at the house.
It's a long walk.
Yeah.
I could use it.
All right,
I gotta swing by the hotel.
I'll see you
at the house later.
MAN: (SINGING)
I see you dressed in white
Every wrong made right
I see a rose in bloom
At the sight of you
You're irreplaceable
Unmistakable, incomparable
It's all-in
It's beautiful
I see it all in you
WOMAN: Sisters,
we can start again
Give honor till the end
Love, we can start again
BOTH: Oh, brothers
We can start again
Give honor till the end
Yes, we can start again
We can start again
We can start again
(DIALING CELL PHONE)
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
AUTOMATED VOICE:
At the end of your message,
press one.
(BEEPS)
Dale, hey, call me.
I think I found something.
Hello. Massage?
Is she here?
Is she available?
You want her?
One hour?
Where is she?
She very expensive.
You must pay first.
What room?
Antonia!
You tell what kind
of massage, and...
Antonia!
ANTONIA: James!
You cannot go back there!
You don't go!
You cause trouble!
Antonia!
James!
Oh! No!
(GRUNTS)
Stop that guy!
(GRUNTING)
JAMES: Keep going.
Are you okay?
I don't feel good.
All right. Come on.
We have to go back
for Maria.
I won't stop till
we get her back.
You are bleeding,
James.
It's fine.
But you are
still handsome.
Do you know
you are very handsome?
I'll remind you
that you said that later.
She, uh, had a little bit
too much to drink.
(SOFTLY) Dale?
(LINE RINGING)
(GARO SPEAKING SPANISH)
Where's Dale?
You have my girl.
(SIGHS) She's not your girl.
Amigo, I do not agree
with you.
Irregardless,
I have the old man.
And I have her sister.
Now I won't hurt
the sister, not yet.
And the old man, I really haven't
decided yet, but that's up to you.
You follow directions and
maybe everyone walks home.
What do you want?
Ay, man.
Look, you're not good at this,
so let me make this easy for you.
You give me the girl,
I give you the old man.
The sister stays with me,
but she remains untouched as long
as Antonia is returned to me.
Because they're a pair.
You see this?
They're a family.
You can't separate family.
Where do you want to meet?
But don't try to be a hero,
or I kill them both
and I make you watch, okay?
Where?
There's a little park
on Central and Main.
8:30. Be there.
It's the charade, this thing
that you two are doing.
You know this?
You are a murderer.
I've not murdered
anybody yet.
There is no difference
between a murderer
and a person that steals
a girl's innocence
and kills her soul.
Wow, man.
I never thought
of that before.
It's very deep.
Does this help you?
You go through all this?
All of this for some girl
you don't even know?
No.
It's for my daughter.
I don't know what
you're talking about, man.
What do you mean
by this?
Ten years ago.
You took my daughter.
(SNIFFS)
My friend,
I hate to disappoint you,
but 10 years ago,
I was still in high school.
You're all the same man.
Different names,
different faces,
but you're all the same.
My daughter
ran away
for a man like you.
She swallowed
your drugs.
She believed your lies.
And you turned her
into property.
Where is your
little girl now?
She never made
her 18th birthday.
Man, this thing is old.
It's very old, old...
Old Testament old.
I'm sure it was, uh,
nothing personal.
Just his business.
Do you know what you are?
Hmm?
You are
the hollowed-out shell
that's left after
a snake sheds its skin.
Garo.
You know there's hope?
That's New Testament.
Hmm.
Maybe for some people, man.
JAMES: This is yours.
You are a changed man, James.
Thank you for
trying to help us.
Okay, I don't know
how this is gonna turn out.
But you have to know
that I...
This is how it must be.
Hmm?
There won't be another
chance for me to say this...
James,
I know.
(LINE RINGING)
MALE DISPATCHER:
911 emergency.
Hello.
Can you tell me
your location?
Hello?
Whatever happens,
trust me.
I do.
(SPEAKS SPANISH)
Stay close.
A playground? Really?
GARO: Sí.
It's a beautiful day
for this one, no?
Ah. I'm embarrassed
for us, Garo.
I mean, look at us.
Look at us!
GARO: Yeah.
(LOUDLY) Look at us!
(CHILDREN SCREAMING)
Hey! Amigo, amigo, amigo!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nada!
Carrying guns.
Holding hostages.
Maybe, you know,
maybe we go crazy.
Maybe we shoot
everybody. Eh?
It's this you want, huh?
No, no, no. Here we go.
Here we go.
Yeah, here we go, man.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You're replaceable.
I'm replaceable.
Girls?
They're replaceable.
Sí. Okay.
Yeah.
You kill mine.
I'll kill yours.
Round and round
we go 'cause it...
It doesn't end here.
Not today.
So, amigo,
put down the gun, or I prove your point,
we start with this one, sí?
Watch this one
replaced, yeah?
One, two... Okay, hey.
No, no, no.
I'm not kidding you, man.
Hey.
This is no game for me.
All right, all right.
Put your gun down, man.
JAMES: Sure.
Sí, sí.
Antonia, aquí!
(GRUNTING)
(GUNSHOT)
No!
(GRUNTING)
(SIRENS BLARING IN DISTANCE)
GARO: Come on, man, do it.
Do it, man!
Did Antonia tell you about our
special night together, man?
Did she tell you about
how we made love, man?
Huh? Huh?
Yeah?
Yeah, do it!
Do it, do it, do it!
ANTONIA: (DISTORTED) James!
You're weak, boy.
EMERSON: Daddy.
GARO: Huh?
Do it!
James, no!
Drop the weapon,
or I'll shoot!
Cry now, boy. It's okay.
Come on. Do it, man. Huh?
(GUN CLATTERS)
Okay, man.
(POLICE RADIO CHATTER)
Dale.
Dale.
Dale.
(SOBBING)
(INAUDIBLE)
MAN: How much?
How long?
Hour.
Hundred bucks
will get you everything.
I was thinking
more like 20.
(SCOFFS)
Twenty bucks ain't gonna
get you a handshake.
(SCOFFS) You gotta
be kidding.
I'm doing you a favor.
Stupid...
(SNIFFLING)
You said a hundred bucks?
Yeah.
This way.
Cash on the nightstand.
What's your name?
They call me Tennessee.
What's your real name?
Kelli.
Hi, Kelli.
I'm James.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
I'm sorry. I didn't...
I didn't mean to surprise you.
You're okay.
Kelli, this is Antonia.
Antonia, this is Kelli.
It is nice to meet you.
Can we tell you
a story?
Whatever.
It's your money.
A year ago, just about,
I met a woman
a lot like you.
She'd been lied to and forced
into the same situation.
Men decided she was
worth a certain price.
I fell in love
with that woman.
And to me, she is worth more
than all the money in the world.
You have that same worth
inside of you.
Kelli, you've been taught to talk and
dress and act like you're cheap.
We think... No.
We believe that there's a God that
knows exactly what you're worth.
Look, this is my choice.
And that means that you have the
freedom to make another choice.
JAMES: Hey.
This doesn't have to
define you.
(SNIFFLING)
JAMES: It's in these moments I think
of my old friend and what he did.
And I know he sees us.
I know he's looking down
from up there.
His death gave life.
It gave us each other.
It gave us a new world,
a new understanding of love.
Led a father back
to his daughter.
Led a woman to a new life.
A new chance.
And it led us to this place.
A place where a woman can
rediscover her immeasurable worth,
passed down to us
by God himself.
And so
the story continues on,
and so does
this deep knowledge
that every life,
man, woman, boy, and girl,
is incredibly, undoubtedly,
completely
priceless.
