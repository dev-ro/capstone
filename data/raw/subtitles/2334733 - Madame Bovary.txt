Un. Deux. Trois.
Quatre. Cinq.
Six. Sept. Huit.
Neuf. Dix.
Camille, Emma! En place!
Please God, let him be the right one.
Please God, let him be the right one.
Please God, let him be the right one.
Emma...
when your dear mother died, I cried.
I didn't know
how to raise a little girl.
A pig? Yes.
But you, with all those ideas
in your head, I could not.
Charles, you are a good man.
And a good doctor.
Emma's mother can finally rest
knowing I married her well.
This was your mother's
favorite wedding gift.
Please think of us
when you eat your sweets.
Santé.
- This is Henriette.
- Madame.
Would you mind helping us
with some of these things?
- Of course. Let me, Madame.
- Thank you.
What's the matter, dear?
It's all part of nature.
I need to remove my dress.
I cannot remove it alone.
Sorry.
Sleep, dear. I didn't want to wake you.
Stay with me.
It is the patient that must find solace
in the bed, never the doctor.
But all doctors are husbands too,
aren't they?
Only in the evenings, dear.
Enjoy your day.
They're beautiful, Madame.
Thank you.
- Are those for eating?
- Of course.
You must have spent
all afternoon on this.
You shouldn't go to such trouble.
Henriette is always quick
to pick fruit from the orchard.
Is that what you would prefer?
It is simply custom.
Fruit, please.
Any patients of note today?
Any curious ailments?
Curious?
In the morning,
a patient needed to be bled.
On another, I applied leeches.
His... wife prepared me
a delicious mushroom omelet for lunch.
Oh, then yes, in the afternoon,
a patient had something quite inexplicable.
I examined his chamber pot twice,
but it remains a mystery.
Madame? Monsieur Lheureux
is here to see you.
Oh, just as everyone said,
simply beautiful.
That's most kind of you,
but I must apologize.
It's not proper for me to receive you
with my hair in such disarray.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Forgive me for making haste.
I could not simply let the day go by
without gaining your confidence.
I was told you were an elegant
woman of taste, and...
well, I am a man
in the service of such women.
Whatever you command, I will provide you
with. I visit Rouen at least twice a week.
- You do?
- Yes, I'm connected to all the best houses:
"Trois Frères", "La Barbe d'Or",
"Le Grand Sauvage".
Anything you wish.
Romantic novels, chocolates, candies.
Look at this.
- Simply beautiful, is it not?
- Yes, it is.
How many would you like?
Oh, I'm afraid I can't.
I've only just arrived.
And this, this, this,
this is... made of pearl.
Carved in open-work by convicts
in the West Indies.
They are lovely.
Oh, but it's too soon.
I want to show you something.
My father's wedding gift.
Simply beautiful.
We have so much to share.
These, however, you must have.
These are woven in Algeria
but the silk, I don't know,
is of mythical quality.
Touch one, touch one.
- You have exquisite taste!
- Thank you.
Angel.
Look closer. Look at these spangles.
Almost threads of gold. They scintillate
like stars in the night, do they not?
- How much?
- A mere nothing.
It's lovely, really, but it's too soon.
I haven't even spoken
of these matters with Charles.
Very well, very well. I understand.
I will leave you some fashion journals
and a book of fabrics.
You really mustn't worry about the money.
I can give you some, if need be.
On credit, of course.
I know Charles is good for it.
On credit?
Yes, it means you can pay me
whenever you like.
Now.
This. Beautiful, no?
Maison Lheureux. He runs
the boutique out of his own house.
That is the end of the village.
Come.
Oh, I should introduce you to Homais.
He's our local chemist.
We work closely together.
Look at this month?
Emma! You've joined us at last!
You're beautiful.
Welcome to Yonville.
My dear... Monsieur Homais,
and Monsieur Binet, our tax collector.
And Monsieur Leon Dupuis,
our legal clerk.
Madame no doubt has had little time
to rest since her journey.
Well, moving about amuses me.
I find it tedious to always stay
in the same place.
I couldn't agree more.
Not me. I'm most content with the same
slippers and same fireplace every night.
Charles, nothing is more pleasant
than traveling.
You wouldn't say that if you were
constantly obliged to be in the saddle.
You're wrong. I would talk of nothing else.
Just last year, I was in Switzerland.
You can't imagine the enormity
of the valleys, or the poetry of the lakes.
It moved me to such enthusiasm.
I was comm...
Emma, you mustn't mistake
Leon's profession for his heart.
He might appear to be
just a legal clerk,
but secretly inside he's the last
romantic left in all of France.
Oh, no, no. It's no laughing matter.
I'm quite concerned, actually.
The other day, I heard him singing
The Guardian Angel in his bedroom,
and he was really giving it his all.
There's nothing that elevates
my soul more than music.
Not you too, Emma!
I need you to be sensible.
- I have a favor to ask you, actually.
- Of me?
I'd like to show you something
in the kitchen.
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse us?
Monsieur Binet,
could I trouble you for the bread?
Hippolyte here works at the inn,
day and night, bussing tables.
And he does all this
with an atrocious impediment.
Isn't that right, Hippolyte?
Show Madame your foot.
See? It's gruesome, is it not?
I'm sorry.
Now Emma,
as a partisan of progress, it is
my duty to keep this town to the fore.
Which is why I need your help to convince
Charles to operate on this poor man.
- I believe I should be convinced first, sir.
- It's for your own sake!
Well, Madame, what do you say?
I'm afraid it is not my place
to tell Charles.
No. No, forget convention and modality.
There are no risks here,
only advantages.
Success.
Certain relief.
Beautification of the patient.
But no less important,
celebrity to be gained by the surgeon.
All of what you speak of
is most alluring.
But the decision is not mine,
it's up to Charles.
Oh, very well.
But you will at least help me
convince him, will you not?
We'll see.
Excellent.
I haven't devoted
much time to the garden.
It could be so beautiful.
I'll take care of it.
You've never thought of a fish pond,
perhaps over here?
You'll have plenty of time to do
as you wish. Best to come inside.
Surely, it's for you to enjoy as well.
Well, yes. But not so early,
and not in this cold.
Okay, one more.
This should be the worst of it.
Yeah. Yeah, it's coming off.
That's most of it done.
There, there. I think
you're good to cover up now.
No, but that is once
you've done the operation.
The diagrams are very detailed.
Yes, well, you've never seen
anything like them, I'm sure.
They use a hand here.
Now, we must all understand
the future importance of this machine.
This here is a symbol of industry.
It is a feat of engineering.
Notice the treadmill gives a perfect
regularity of motion to the horse.
Here we go, here we go!
But this configuration seems
extremely uncomfortable for the horse.
- Well...
- When does the animal rest?
They should have two horses taking turns,
or some form of schedule.
Well, I suppose every town
has its diversions.
Is this ours?
Well, it isn't Paris.
- Have you been?
- I have.
It's even better than you can imagine.
It alights your every sense.
Nothing at all like Yonville.
I apologize. I shouldn't speak that way.
You've only just arrived, and well...
to be honest, there's nothing to feed
my soul here but my very own mind.
I feel guilty saying that.
No, don't. Guilt will
bring you nothing, I swear.
When I was sent to the convent
for my education,
I had a beautiful idea of the piety
of those... pale-faced women
with their rosaries
and their convictions.
I wanted to be just as they are,
but I couldn't.
I puzzled myself to find
some vow to fulfill.
At confession,
I even invented little sins.
No, I was mortified.
I wanted only emotions, not discipline.
The good nuns declared me to be
without calling and cast me out
to read romance novels and fulfill
the desires of the heart.
They made me ill,
but it was only later that I realized
that my guilt had been keeping me
from the happiness I deserved.
And have you found that happiness here?
Forgive me. I did not hear you enter.
- Charles is visiting a patient.
- I'm not here to see Charles.
No?
Of how may I be of service?
Of no service. I... I hoped you
might accompany me on a walk.
A walk?
It's a lovely day.
I have a gift for you.
- I can't accept.
- It's a trifle.
A relic from my days in Paris. Take it.
When I was a child,
I had a map like this.
Every night, I would close my eyes
and trace down the boulevards
and over the bridges,
imagining myself in a carriage
passing all the busy people.
All of them with someplace to be.
Well, that's all I've got.
I win again.
I'm going to bed.
- Do you mind if we play another?
- No. Please. By all means.
- Good night.
- Good night, Charles.
Come with me.
Please. I need to talk to you.
Come.
I fear I might be going mad.
I think of nothing but you.
I cannot even hear my voice
in my own head.
I only hear yours.
- I'm married.
- Tell me you feel differently.
Parents. Now go back there,
sit down, and stop messing about.
Charlotte, will you sit up straight!?
Now all of you...
The young scamps. They respect nothing.
You look pleasant, Madame Bovary.
I don't feel pleasant, Monsieur l'Abbé.
Nor do I. Might be what I ate.
Or maybe it's the season.
Cold days weaken one
most remarkably, don't they?
- I suppose.
- Yeah. As Saint Paul says,
we are born to suffer.
I've known poor young mothers,
virtuous women, of course,
veritable saints,
who did not have enough bread.
What of those, Monsieur l'Abbé,
those who have bread,
but don't have any...
Fire in winter?
Does that matter?
Does it matter?
Seems to me that once you have a good fire,
sufficient food, and a good husband...
Boudet!
I'll warm your ears for you, you imp!
Talking of which...
how is Monsieur Bovary?
Well, that is what I...
what I came to talk to you about.
Sick as well. Too much work.
We two are the busiest men in the parish.
I, the doctor of the soul,
he of the body.
You're most unwell.
You should get home.
The first communion
will soon be upon us,
and I must make these devils...
pious.
And I told you all to stay still
and be quiet!
Now, look at me.
Did you know Leon was moving to Rouen?
Homais told me this afternoon.
He didn't give much notice.
Homais was quite upset.
He needs to find a new tenant.
Did he say when?
Tomorrow or the day after.
I never noticed Leon had such
an impulsive nature before.
Shall I tell the master?
No, don't.
It'll only worry him.
It's just my nerves.
This shall pass, Madame.
You'll come to like it here.
I imagined that this would be
the happiest time in my life,
but the calm here in which we live
is not what I dreamt of.
One after another, the days come,
always the same, bringing nothing.
Is this the will of God?
Is my future just a dark corridor
with a bolted door at the end?
Always in a book, dear.
You'll strain your eyes.
This book is fascinating.
It's about the Orient.
Their manner of dress, the rituals,
even their medicine.
I could read it to you.
You might find it of use.
Those are only curiosities.
They have no application in Yonville.
But we certainly won't be spending
the rest of our lives here.
I would hate to disappoint you, my dear,
but I don't see us going to the Orient.
Well, I know that, Charles.
I was thinking Paris, or maybe Rouen.
Do you really believe a country doctor
can open a practice in Rouen on a whim?
- It's...
- But you're not a country doctor!
Very good, Madame. Tighter?
My man is opening a practice in Rouen,
so we are currently without a doctor
- at Vaubeyssard.
- Yes.
Madame Bovary, I suppose?
You... you are blessed, my dear Doctor.
It is most certainly broken.
Emma, dear, would you mind telling
Henriette to warm some water?
Okay.
I was going to ask,
are you on duty Sunday, Doctor?
No, Monsieur Le Marquis.
I always spend Sundays with my wife.
That wouldn't be a problem. We would,
of course invite Madame Bovary to come along.
I'm hosting a hunt next Sunday,
and we need a doctor on premises.
So can I count you in?
Well...
Would...
Madame ride with us?
A hunt, you say?
Sunday...
Well, I see no reason why... why not.
Fantastic.
I look forward to it.
Madame Bovary! It's so good to see you.
Beautiful as ever, of course.
Charles and I were treated
with the most extraordinary invitation.
The Marquis D'Andervilliers invited us
to a Chasse à Courre!
And you don't have
a tenue d'amazone, I suppose?
- This is going to be very expensive.
- You will extend me credit, will you not?
Money should never be the problem,
only the solution.
My dear doctor.
Please forgive us for taking
Madame Bovary along.
I leave you in excellent company.
By all means, Monsieur le Marquis,
enjoy the hunt.
Emma could do
with the fresh air and exercise.
As for me, a day
not in the saddle is a day of bliss.
I'm much happier here with the buffet.
My dear friends!
What good fortune it is to share
this moment with all of you today.
I cannot fully grasp the reason
for my euphoria this morning.
Hunting is part of my life and my soul.
Who could live more fully...
love more deeply, or celebrate so well as
the hunter with his horse and his hounds?
So now, my dear friends,
on your saddles!
Come in.
- Good morning, Monsieur.
- Good morning.
Madame.
What is it, Madame?
You don't wear a uniform.
No, Madame. I never have.
Of course not. It's my fault.
I've never bought you one.
I'm happy to wear
my own clothes, Madame.
Yes, but a uniform is a proper dress
of someone of your profession.
Go see Lheureux.
He'll dress you appropriately.
As you wish, Madame.
- What's that?
- What's what?
That box.
It's a cigar case.
I couldn't find an opportune moment
to return it to the Marquis.
You should save it 'til after
you've operated on Hippolyte.
I'll have this returned to the Marquis.
I've been thinking.
What's there to think about, dear?
We must progress.
As Homais said, there are only benefits.
No, there are risks.
How do you think the Marquis' doctor
opened a practice in Rouen?
He took risks.
I would like all
of these curtains changed.
I want them to be made of gold damask
with an embroidered print of some kind.
I know just the look you want.
I would also like new linens,
and two silver candelabras.
- Silver?
- Well, surely gold is twice as much.
Yes, but if you bought one large gold
candelabra, it would fit the table better.
It wouldn't cost much more
than two silver ones.
Anything else?
- There was one more item.
- Well, don't hesitate.
- I saw a rug in...
- A rug! That's not drinking the sea.
- But what about the dresses?
- We'll get those too! Stop dithering.
Take it, take it.
Each moment you do not possess
what you love is a moment not spent in love.
And a heart without love
is a heart without a voice.
No song, no life.
Do you like this for the fair?
Doesn't feel too austere, does it?
You look beautiful, Madame.
You have such a figure.
A spoonful of vinegar with every meal.
After a week, you don't even
taste it anymore.
Doctor.
Madame. What a superb morning!
Yes. Everybody is out.
It's not, too cold.
My goodness! What an amazing beast!
Remarkable.
It's time for the awards.
Well, I won't keep you from the ceremony.
Pleasure seeing you both.
Good day.
Dear, would it bother you terribly
if I ran home to rest?
I'm feeling fatigued but I'd hate
to miss this evening's festivities.
- Are you unwell?
- No, just tired.
- Would you like me to join you?
- No, no, dear. I know you enjoy this.
Your note worried me.
Are you not feeling well?
In all truth?
I'm drifting into depression.
You?
If only I'd found some love,
I wouldn't have to act such turbulent joys
or fling myself into such
fantasies and follies.
As a woman, I'm not permitted
such distractions.
Sad distractions.
For happiness is not found in it.
Gentlemen, may I be permitted first of all
to pay tribute to the higher administration
to the government. For friends,
it is my duty to pay tribute...
Again, duty. It's always duty.
I'm sick of that word.
One's duty is to feel what is great,
to cherish the beautiful,
not accept the conventions of society.
To some extent, one must bow
to the opinions of the world,
and accept its moral code.
But... there are two codes.
There's the eternal, the poetic,
which is ours. And the other?
Sad...
convention.
With all due respect, Monsieur le Marquis,
we should put an end to this discussion.
Then I shall... I shall be
something to you?
I can only offer you my friendship.
How dare you? You come here
to offer me your friendship?
Madame Bovary.
Charles forgot to return this.
You didn't come here all the way
through the woods
to return a cigar case, did you?
Please.
Well...
I have been thinking.
Really? And what have you
been thinking about?
Well, I realized that...
before getting married, I was contemplating
my coming life like a child...
in a theater.
Sitting there in high spirits,
and eagerly waiting
for the play to begin.
It was a blessing in my early youth
that I did not know
what was really going to happen.
When I look back now, it seems
that I was like an innocent prisoner,
condemned not to death but to life,
and as yet unconscious
of what the sentence meant.
The longer I live, the more clearly
I feel that on a whole...
life is a... a disappointment.
Oh, my dear. Perhaps you are
simply in need of a confidante.
A lady friend who could advise you
in such feminine matters.
- Unfortunately, I'm not...
- I came here because I need you.
I will not remain standing inert
in this fever of despair.
My dear Emma, you are unrelentingly
standing under an apple tree,
wishing to smell the scent
of orange blossoms.
So yes, you are indeed standing inert.
Lost in a world of... illusions.
You like to hear the words but you have
no courage to act upon your feelings.
I do! I do have courage!
Please, do not push me away!
Yes...
indeed.
It took you a lot of courage
just to come here, didn't it?
- Madame? Monsieur Homais.
- Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma.
You are beautiful, you are wise,
and you are magic.
- I don't know how you've done it.
- Oh, it's all Monsieur Lheureux.
Monsieur Lheur...?
Forgive me. I wasn't commenting
on the house,
which is indeed in exquisite taste.
No, Charles has agreed to operate
on Hippolyte's wretched foot!
Yes!
This book contains everything
he must know for the surgery.
Do not let him rest until he has
learned it all. You hear me?
- Yes.
- Excellent.
And very soon, you will be the wife
of a famous country surgeon.
What? This is what you want, is it not?
- Of course.
- Of course.
Study hard, Charles!
Do you love me?
Of course I do.
A great deal?
Yes.
And you haven't loved any others?
You didn't think you'd got
a virgin, did you?
Of course not.
But I love you so that I could not live
without you. Don't you see?
Ladies and gentlemen of Yonville,
you see before you your great doctor,
Charles Bovary,
who today will finally cure
our poor crippled friend Hippolyte
of his most ignominious of traits.
You may come forward,
but keep your calm.
Remember.
Some more brandy.
Come, come, come.
Take a good slug of that.
- Good boy.
- Monsieur Dubuc, if you would hold the box.
It must not move.
We shall begin.
I know. I know.
Second incision.
You're nearly done. You're nearly done.
Despite the prejudices that still invest
a part of Europe like a net,
the light of hope begins to penetrate
our country places.
Thus it was on Tuesday,
our little town of Yonville found itself
the stage of a great surgical operation
and loftiest act of philanthropy.
Monsieur Bovary, our most
distinguished practitioner,
performed an operation
on a club footed man.
Moreover, that operation
was performed as if by magic.
And barely a few drops of blood
appeared on the skin,
as though to say that the rebellious
tendon had at last...
given way beneath the endeavors
of the surgical art.
- To progress.
- To progress!
Help! Help!
I'm going mad. He won't stop screaming.
He thinks he's dying.
Calm down. What's the matter
with our ungrateful patient?
He's having hideous convulsions.
He struck the machine on his leg
against the wall enough to break it.
Yes.
Go, Charles. You must ensure
the success of the operation.
We'll return shortly.
Well?
I removed the box, but the swelling
is much worse than I imagined.
Perhaps it was a vulgus.
What?
I may have cut the wrong tendon.
I'm worried that if it... does not heal
properly and gangrene sets in,
then we will have to amputate.
- My love...
- Don't touch me.
What is it?
This was not meant to be.
- You know how much I love you...
- Stop it!
- Calm down. You're not being yourself.
- Leave me alone!
How can Charles be so complacent?
He has no notion of my torment.
If he'd even once just tried
to understand me, I wouldn't have...
He's the cause of my misery.
I wish he would beat me,
so I might have a reason to hate him.
You're... you're here.
Take me away. I beg you.
You can't do this.
It's reckless.
You're compromising yourself.
You're married, Emma.
We could be married.
We could go live elsewhere. In Paris!
You really are mad.
How is that possible?
Please! I thought I married
a doctor, but he's not.
He's a butcher. He tortures me.
I can't stand another day of having
to eat while peasants cough
and recount their whole
vile medical histories.
Have courage. Be patient.
I have been patient!
I've suffered long enough!
You can't leave me like this!
Very well.
Give me some time
to arrange some affairs.
You look beautiful.
Henriette, will you please stop crying?
Listen, you will take good care
of Charles, won't you?
You have to promise me.
He is a good man.
Thank you.
- Who is it?
- A gift from Monsieur le Marquis.
- Monsieur Homais.
- Forgive me, forgive me.
I had to see for myself.
A plum?
No, no, no. I don't believe that.
That's extraordinary!
Yes, the irregularities
of the nervous system can be...
perplexing.
Well, you know, my friend Bridaux
has a dog that...
goes into convulsions every time
you hold a snuff box up to him.
- It's curious though, isn't it?
- No. It's not.
You will wake Emma.
Rest, dear. Rest.
Here's the leg. This should certainly
improve our friend's step.
The socket is lined with cork.
It has spring joints but function aside,
consider only the aesthetics.
- I did not order this.
- Oh, Madame Bovary ordered it.
And it was not inexpensive.
Three hundred francs.
It's been over a month now
and she did not leave a deposit,
so I will require
complete payment right away.
Well, you may keep it.
I can't. It's made to precise
individual measurements.
- But I cannot pay you.
- Charles, you are obliged to.
Otherwise, I must exercise the law.
I will give you until spring to pay,
then I'll extend you an additional
500 francs on your loan
to cover whatever costs
incurred by Madame's...
- Illness.
- Illness.
Fine.
My dear Charles, I think I may have
the cure for Madame.
Emma, are you familiar
with the great baritone Romeo Fidanza?
- Yes, of course.
- Well, what about him?
My closest supplier, the owner of La Maison
Trois Frères, is holding a recital.
I have a few invitations.
Only for my best clients, of course.
This is exactly what she needs.
To wear a beautiful gown, to be herself,
and take pleasure in what she loves.
Emma, think of it. What a figure
you'll cut in that beautiful silk gown?
The one with the bow in the back.
Emma, dear.
You won't believe who is here!
Leon! What a coincidence.
Is this your first time in Rouen?
I studied medicine here
but it's Emma's first time.
- First time to a chamber recital?
- Yes.
- And?
- It was absolutely beautiful.
What this must mean to you.
So, tell us, Leon, how is life in Rouen?
I've been working
at a rather large office,
getting excellent practice
while I finish my studies.
Have you found time to enjoy
Rouen's cultural life?
Oh, yes. I go to the opera quite often.
I've seen all the great tenors.
- Rubini, Grisi, Periani.
- I can't imagine.
Rubini is performing tomorrow.
He is sublime. You should come.
Unfortunately,
I must be back in the morning.
In all honesty, I never summoned
the courage to go to the opera
in the four years I spent here.
I don't fully understand the purpose.
Doesn't the music
drown out all the words
- and make it impossible to...
- Charles!
Do you wish to stay, my dear?
We could meet at the cathedral.
You must see it.
Think it over, dear.
Night brings counsel.
Hippolyte! Give me a hand here.
How do you feel with the boot?
Just give me some coppers
and I'll carry your bags.
That one.
Thanks.
What is it?
My father passed.
I just heard the news,
and under the sad circumstances,
I thought I'd come along
and offer my services.
Thank you, but we can do without.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
I beg your pardon, Madame, but I should
like a word with you in private.
It's about that affair.
I have been very good to you, Emma.
Weren't you glad to come across
old acquaintances in Rouen?
Don't you think your timing
is a trifle inopportune?
Your husband is a good fellow.
- Kind. Honorable.
- What do you want?
Your debt has become quite formidable,
but you know that well enough by now.
This matter specifically
relates to your little...
fancies in Rouen.
His father is not yet buried,
and you blackmail me?
I happen to know Charles has inherited
a plot of land just outside the town
with 14 acres, so...
I could extend his credit.
But in his state...
I think it better if he gave you
power of attorney.
That way, we, you and I...
could continue our little
business transactions.
This one.
This one...
Not this one.
- Dear, you are wrong to get so impatient.
- It's awful. My fingers have gone stiff.
I know. Try again.
It's no use. I can't get better
without instruction.
- Don't say that.
- But it's true.
The only teachers are in Rouen.
Well, if you must, take a lesson.
How was your day?
Good.
I was admiring this magnificent
new rug, Emma.
Why, thank you.
Has Henriette not served you yet?
No.
Oh, dear. You must be starving.
I'll fetch dinner immediately.
What is it, Charles?
What has your friend
gotten into your head?
Homais? Nothing.
Lheureux was looking for you today.
He brought over a bill, and I opened it.
- Oh, dear. Why did you do that?
- I need you to know that I do not make,
nor ever have made,
enough money to pay what is due.
Please, dear. You upset
yourself unnecessarily.
Look around. Look at everything we have.
The rugs, the new curtains, the chairs.
Really, Charles, look at everything.
You must confess that considering
the quantity, the cost isn't too dear.
Those are all extravagances!
I could have done without them all!
But you enjoy it.
- Do you not sit in your chair every day?
- But I didn't need it upholstered.
Nor do I need silk lining in my jacket,
or pistachio cream
for my dessert or oysters!
Not everybody can be rich, dear.
September 2nd, 200 francs.
October 5th, three-seventy-five francs.
November 20th, 450 francs.
There's no end to this.
You owe me ten thousand francs,
and you must begin to pay.
- But I have nothing to pay you with!
- Oh, but you do.
Charles' inheritance.
It shall be finished.
- What are you doing here? Why today?
- I had a horrible fight with Charles.
- I'm working. I can't see you now.
- Come now. You can slip out with me.
That's impossible. My master has already
complained about my absences.
This isn't like before.
There's something I must discuss
with you urgently.
Please. It's of a legal nature.
Very well. Wait for me outside.
I want you to grow a pointed beard
like the Duke of Normandy.
What is the legal matter?
Let's buy you a new suit today.
All black.
No. I don't want to, and more
importantly, I can't afford one.
- How you care for your money.
- Yes, I do. Very much. Now...
what is the legal matter
you wanted to speak of?
- Marriage.
- Marriage?
Yes.
- You are married, Emma.
- Exactly.
You are going
to leave me too, aren't you?
You will marry someone else.
You'll be like all the others.
Like what others?
Emma, like what others?
- Like all men.
- Which men?
You are all evil, every one of you.
I cannot accompany you.
- Leon, please.
- I will meet you at the hotel tonight.
Now please go.
- Leon!
- You must stop doing this.
But you never came! I must speak to you!
Do you know what you're
doing to me? These visits?
Every day, I must reckon with my companions
making jokes about me.
You twit! You worry about your fellow
clerks making jokes about you?
Do you not love me?
- Do you not love me?
- Leon!
This is of absolute reproach.
You are ruining yourself
with a married woman.
Dismiss her at once
or you will be dismissed.
Yes. She's just leaving, sir.
Who was that?
- What have you done?
- Who was that?
The bailiff.
No. No, no, that can't be.
That's all wrong.
Monsieur Lheureux,
there's been some kind of mistake.
A bailiff has just left my house
with an order to collect everything
within 14 days!
Did you not hear me?
A judgment and a restraint.
- Yes. You must fix this.
- I'm afraid I can't.
I was pressed for capital and had to
pass on your debts to a creditor in Rouen,
a Monsieur Vinçart.
But you made a promise!
I was being bled myself.
The knife was at my throat.
You simply have too many bills.
One gets in quite a muddle over them.
But surely, good Monsieur Lheureux, you can
talk to Monsieur Vinçart and quiet him.
Quiet Vinçart? You don't know him.
He's more ferocious than a bear.
You could try the Marquis.
- The Marquis?
- Yes, I hear he's back from his sojourn.
Now, if you may, I must send
these parcels out at once.
Madame Bovary?
Are you here to pay alms?
No, Monsieur l'Abbé.
To confess?
No.
- To seek counsel?
- No.
Just silence.
Have you tried a walk in the forest?
It never is absolutely quiet,
but I believe...
one can find great silence
in the sounds of nature.
Good afternoon, Madame.
Charming. Very pretty room.
Correspondence.
Allow me.
Must make sure you're not hiding
any gold coins.
Sir. Madame Bovary.
You haven't changed a bit.
You're still as charming as ever.
They are poor charms
since you disdained them.
What do you want?
I am ruined.
I need 10,000 francs.
Ten thousand francs?
My husband borrowed against our home.
We shall have the money soon,
but today for want of just 10,000 francs,
we are to be sold off.
I do not have the money that you need.
- You don't?
- I'm struggling myself.
I pity you very much.
The least of these trifles
could get you the money.
You want for nothing.
I don't have the money that you need.
You made me believe that you loved me!
For months, you held me
in the sweetest dream!
Do you remember your letter?
It tore my heart,
and still I come back to implore you.
But you just look through me,
and disdain me again?
I do not have the money that you need.
What are you doing?
What on earth are you doing?
You put those back.
They're not yours to give.
Emma. Emma!
- That can't be it.
- It is.
- Surely this is enough for an extension?
- No.
- And with my piano?
- It's too late. There's no way out.
The court has made its judgment.
Did you think, little lady, that I would be
your supplier and your banker
until the end of time,
just for the love of God?
- But the amount is far too much! I...
- And whose fault is that?
While I'm slaving away in here,
you're gadding about!
- And I'm the one with the fickle heart?
- Not a sermon, please!
- It never does any harm.
- You are a wretch!
Such a little hothead.
I know it's not very pleasant.
I'm aware of that.
But it never killed anyone, did it?
And it's the only way
for you to pay me back.
But could you not lend me just a...
None whatsoever.
You have been an excellent patron.
And I have done very well by you.
But in this state, I do not
see value in this proposition!
Madame?
Madame?
Mme. Bovary!
Emma!
Emma!
Mme. Bovary!
Emma!
Emma!
Emma!
