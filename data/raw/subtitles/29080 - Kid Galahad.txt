Slow down! Slow down!
Keep away from him.
Burke, use that left!
Slow down, will you?
He saw that signal.
He's seen all of them.
When did he start getting the idea
he could outslug McGraw?
Maybe he's dazed.
Oh, dazed nothing.
He's had his orders for weeks.
Four, five...
...six, seven, eight...
...nine, ten.
When he wakes up,
tell him he's through.
SILVER: You don't mean that, Nick.
- I mean it plenty.
- Come on, Fluff, let's go.
- Oh, now, Nick, you keep your temper.
You're crazy to dump him now
after you brought him this far.
He's still good for a shot at the title.
You're throwing away a million dollars.
One licking
don't make him a preliminary again.
I wouldn't care if he was champ now.
When any guy starts thinking he has
the brains and stops taking orders, he's out.
- Come on, Fluff.
- Well, we could swim after that splash.
We'll have to start looking
for a new fighter.
Yeah.
- It's getting to be a regular routine.
- That's the way it goes.
Bring up a guy above his level,
he gets to thinking he knows it all...
...and gets thrown flatter than gold leaf.
- That's flat.
I'm gonna meet a guy that can go
the whole distance and listen to orders.
I'll make him champ.
Did it ever occur to you that maybe
Burke didn't wanna be champion?
Where did you get that idea?
He's fallen for a girl.
Maybe he wants to quit and get married.
How do you know?
Just watching him
develop the symptoms.
Well, I didn't notice anything.
Married? Well, that's the craziest...
People still believe in it.
Nick, you don't notice a lot of things.
You're so wrapped up in the game...
...that, well, you forget
people have feelings and are human.
There isn't any room
for feelings in this game.
A fighter's a machine, not a violin player.
Say, maybe I kind of forget you
once in a while.
- Or do I?
- Yes.
Quite often.
I'm a mug for treating you the way I do.
Yes.
Am I in the doghouse?
No.
[CHUCKLES]
You're swell, Fluff.
I know everything you do for me
even if I don't say it.
You put up with a lot,
keeping me in line, don't you?
It's like riding herd on a skyrocket.
I'm happy, Nick.
So am I.
Just you keep slapping my ears down.
I will. I wasn't close enough tonight.
What, you mean
when I fired that palooka?
Oh, well, forget it.
- How much dough we lose tonight?
- Seventeen thousand, three hundred.
- How much have we got left?
- Eighteen hundred.
Well, might as well shoot it on a party
and start over.
Don't we always?
[JAZZY MUSIC PLAYING]
[CHATTERING]
MAN:
Donati has the best champagne in town.
Operator, I want long distance.
Give me Baltimore.
I never saw anybody drink so much
except a camel.
I say to my wife, Signor Donati,
he loves to give a party.
Three days ago I shave him. Big party.
Today, haircut and another big party.
Well, it's the same party.
What? A party three days
and three nights?
That's splendido, splendido, magnifico!
It isn't a party.
It's an endurance contest.
What are you peddling those drinks for?
You're supposed to be enjoying yourself.
- Where's that bellhop?
- He drank more than he served.
They carried him out by his heels.
- I'll get another one.
- Better get one with a small stomach, Nick.
Hello? Say, what's the matter
with your bellhops?
Well, send one up to 508, will you?
And be sure he's got a sober appetite.
Operator, you're cutting me off.
I'm calling long distance.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Well, this is service.
- Hello, Fluff.
- Joe, wait a minute.
Nick, it's the press.
Well, let it in. It won't do any harm.
Come in, Mr. Taylor.
The liquor is in the bathroom.
I'm looking for hot news this time, Fluff.
Not much chance. This gang
hasn't been out for air for three days.
No kidding.
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
- Hello, Nick.
- Oh, hello, Joe.
- Some celebration.
- They're just drinking off a hangover.
If you put on this party when you lose,
what would you do if you win?
Lock you guys out
and have a cup of coffee.
- How you enjoying Miami?
- Okay.
What's the inside, Nick?
- On what?
- You throwing Burke away.
There isn't any inside.
Same reason I dropped the rest of them.
He got to thinking
his own brains were good enough.
Come on. That one used to be all right.
But you had this boy
too close to the championship.
- There must have been more behind it.
- It's the same reason.
I'd like to believe you, but I've seen you
pull out that bag of tricks before.
Stop worrying about it
and have a drink, huh?
Oh, Fluff, take care of the gent.
Well, I might as well.
Here's to you.
- Smart.
- That's me all over.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Excuse me. Someone wanted me?
I'll bet plenty of them do, honey.
Mr. Donati's in there.
Thank you.
But I'm so Ionesome for you.
Mr. Donati?
What did you come up on,
the freight elevator?
I got here as soon as I could, sir.
I had to look around for your room.
- Oh, you're new around here, huh?
- Yes, sir.
I'll bet you're the mahoskus
with the dames.
- The what, sir?
- Oh, never mind, skip it.
- What's your name?
- Ward Guisenberry.
What? Gui...?
Hey, everybody, listen.
Come here, tell them your name.
Go on now, tell it.
Ward Guisenberry.
[PEOPLE LAUGHING]
MAN:
Guisenberry.
Listen, all of you. Shh! If you'd all stop
laughing, maybe he'd get some work done.
Come on, get back to the party.
All right, Gooseberry,
go on and mix up some drinks.
You'll find the stuff in the bathroom.
Gooseberry. Can you imagine a guy going
through life with a moniker like that?
Have you got enough ice
and clean glasses?
Now, let's see.
I want four gin slings, a gin rickey,
two Scotch and sodas, some Bacar...
What's the matter?
I don't know how to mix
any of these fancy drinks.
Fancy?
- Are you kidding?
- No, ma'am.
- Haven't you ever had a drink?
- No, ma'am.
I don't suppose you smoke either.
No, I don't.
Well, I never knew
there was any of your kind left.
Why didn't you tell Nick
you couldn't mix them?
This is my first day.
They told me downstairs
that if I didn't give good service...
...he'd have me fired.
If you'll just show me how,
I'll be able to do it.
All right. Now, let's see.
[SPEAKS IN ITALIAN]
You know, you ought to be
in New York, paisan.
Regards.
Operator, get off the line.
I'm still talking.
But, darling, I told you,
I'm all by my little Ionesome.
You're so mean to me,
staying way up there in Baltimore.
Have you got that redheaded dame
up with you that was in the hospital?
I hope she snores.
WOMAN: Say, Nick.
- Yeah?
WOMAN: Looking for Fluff?
NICK: Why?
You'd better rescue her. She's in there
with that good-Iooking bellhop.
WARD: Here, let me help you with that.
FLUFF: Oh, thanks.
This ice is so cold, my hands are frozen.
- Oh, the lemon.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
[FLUFF LAUGHS]
FLUFF:
It's all right. You couldn't help it.
What's going on in here?
Nick, I've just started
the education of a nice boy.
Yeah?
Well, let the hotel educate him.
That's what they're paid for.
You aren't educating anybody but me.
It's my fault, Mr. Donati.
Nobody asked you.
Go on, get those drinks out there.
Yes, sir.
Big mahoskus.
Oh, wait a minute.
- Jealous, Nick?
- Yeah.
Am I in the doghouse again?
No.
Someday that temper of yours
is gonna throw you for a loss.
Not while you're around to flag it down.
Just the trouble.
I might not always be around.
Thinking of Morgan's mob again, huh?
A lot of things.
Say, what did you worry about
before you met me?
I give up.
Oh, Nick, you're such a fool.
I sort of like you too.
Hello, Nick. Hello, Fluff.
FLUFF: Hello.
- What's up?
I found out why Burke went haywire
and lost that fight.
Why?
He got 25 grand to double-cross you
and take a dive.
- Who paid him?
- Turkey Morgan.
He was afraid
of Burke's long-range fighting.
Burke got his dough
before he got on the train.
Nick, what are you going to do?
- I'm gonna pay off that cheap gunman.
- And get yourself filled full of holes?
Think I'm gonna let him
get away with a double-cross?
You drive me crazy.
You always going to throw
the whole works out...
...because that temper
breaks out in a rash?
Don't let him know. Keep him off guard.
You could outsmart him out of his shirt.
What are you so sore about anyway?
The kid's only a bellhop.
We weren't doing anything.
I was only showing him
how to mix a few drinks.
Oh, I'm fed up
with your being jealous all the time.
Hello, Silver. What's all the excitement?
FLUFF:
Oh, it's just a family squabble.
Smart girl.
Yeah, she got sore
because I cracked about the bellhop.
Yeah.
Not a bad-Iooking kid at that.
Come on. Let's get out of here.
This is no place to entertain.
Pardon me, miss.
They've ordered four absinthe frapp√©s
out there and I don't know what that is.
FLUFF:
Remember what I told you.
Gin with lots of ice in it, always.
- Hi, Red.
BUZZ: Hi, Midge.
[MUSIC AND CHATTERING STOPS]
- Hello, Irene.
IRENE: Hi, toots.
Oh, hello, Nick.
How are you?
We thought we'd drop in and tell you
we're sorry you and your fighter busted up.
Yeah, I'm glad you came.
The more the merrier.
You glad to see me, Nick?
Sure. No hard feelings
because you polished off my fighter.
Say, if all your scraps are as easy
as that one, you'll be champion yet.
Is that a crack?
Now, why would it be a crack?
Come on, quit sounding off.
This is a party.
Why, certainly.
Come on, girls,
make yourselves at home.
Oh, crowd, meet the boys.
- Morgan, McGraw, Buzz Stevens.
- Howdy, fellows.
- Fluff, take care of the girls.
- Sure.
Come on now, everybody.
Don't let this party die.
Louie, get busy on those ivories.
[PIANO PLAYING]
Hello, lambie pie.
Will you have a drink?
Look out, handsome.
Oh, he's blushing, girls.
Come on and dance with me.
Oh, I'm afraid I don't dance.
- Oh, what do you do?
- I'm sorry.
- Well, not much of anything, I guess.
- Oh, what a pity.
Can I have one of these
pretty, shiny buttons?
That bellhop certainly has a magog
for the dolls, all right.
Why don't you girls learn to behave?
Come on, be your age.
Sorry, kid.
Thanks.
They're just playful, lambie pie.
Don't feel bad.
Looks as if your sugar
is going for Gooseberry.
Hey, you. Bellhop.
Come here.
[MUSIC STOPS]
You better go over, kid.
Yes, sir?
Fill this up.
You think you're cute.
Your pants are too long to be that cute.
There. Now you look real cute.
Don't he, Chuck?
[CHUCK LAUGHING]
Why don't you lugs
leave that poor kid alone?
Keep out of this.
Mind your own business.
- Don't do that to her.
- Why, you chump.
[WOMEN SCREAM]
- I'll murder him.
BUZZ: Oh, no, you don't.
Lay off. You left yourself wide open.
You ain't gonna break your hand
with a punk like that and blow a title shot.
Get out of here.
You've caused enough trouble.
WARD: I didn't mean to cause any trouble.
- Come on, beat it. Get out.
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Stay out.
You're not gonna let that boy
pay for his ruined uniform.
Oh, forget it.
Trying to frame my fighter
into breaking his hand?
Go on! I never saw the guy before.
If McGraw hadn't been drinking,
the kid could never have got started.
I'll fix him up.
What, and get yourself
thrown in the can?
- I've got an idea how you can get even.
- A lot of people don't like your cute ideas.
Let Sam take it out of his hide
in the ring.
It's okay with me,
as long as he gets a beating.
Well, that's my idea.
Sore because that dame of yours
took out after him?
Yeah.
What makes you think
you can get him to fight Sam?
Say, did you ever see a bellhop
that didn't wanna be a fighter?
Now, listen, this is strictly in the lodge.
Keep your mouths shut.
Thanks.
You know, you showed a lot of courage.
I was scared bowlegged.
I didn't know
what I was getting into in there.
That was the first time
I've ever seen anybody hit a lady.
I see.
Well, thanks again, miss.
[BELLHOP LAUGHING]
What are you dressed for?
A masquerade?
Say, where'd you learn
how to punch like that?
I belong to sort of a boxing club
back home, sir.
You know, fellows that worked
on the different farms.
- How'd you like to be a fighter?
- Well, I never thought much about it.
Let me do the thinking.
You know who you stiffened yesterday?
Yeah, a fighter, I guess,
but I didn't know what I was doing.
I'll say you didn't. You flattened the next
heavyweight champion of the world.
- He was drunk, though.
- Yeah, some.
But the main thing is
you dropped him with one punch.
Remember how quiet everybody got?
Say, you did what nobody else
ever did before: put McGraw on the floor.
You've got dynamite in that right, kid.
That punch of yours
is like money in the bank.
- Good morning, Nicky.
NICK: Morning.
- Oh, hello, Galahad.
WARD: Hello.
Hey, what is this Galahad business?
- It means "clean of heart."
- Clean of heart?
Sure. He was a knight in armor
that used to ride around rescuing fair ladies.
Yeah?
Well, must have been
an interesting racket.
Clean of heart, rescuing ladies.
Say, what is?
Say, what are you working here for anyway?
Well, it's the best job I could get, sir.
I'm trying to make enough money
to buy a farm.
Farm? Well, you string along with me
and a year from now...
...you'll have enough money
to buy 1 0 farms.
And say, there's no...
If you wanna get to the racetrack
with McFarland...
...you better get underway.
- He's waiting for you.
- I've kept him waiting plenty of times.
Yeah, that's when you had a fighter.
Yeah, that's right.
Keeping the count on me, aren't you?
Always.
Now think it over, kid. If you wanna fight,
I'll put you in a soft spot on Tuesday's card.
You know, with a preliminary boy.
Kind of a tryout.
You can quit a hundred bucks to the good,
so what have you got to lose, huh?
Meet you here for dinner.
Oh, tell the kid
how he ought to take a chance, huh?
Oh, no more of that education stuff.
- So he wants you to be a fighter.
- Yeah.
- Do you think I should take the chance?
- Do you?
Well, I don't know. It sounds good.
If I could earn enough money
to buy a farm...
...I guess I could stand
a few pokes in the nose.
- Well, you're big enough to take them.
- Then you think I should?
No, I don't, Galahad.
You got into this on account of me...
...and, well, I think I might at least tell you
what you're walking into.
You'll get thrown into a rotten life...
...that will knock those clear-cut illusions
of yours higher than a kite.
Get mixed up with crowds
like the one here yesterday.
Oh, they may look okay to you,
but they're not.
They're a bunch of fast-living spenders
and punch-drunk gunmen.
And what's more...
...you'll find yourself in the middle of a war
between Nick and Turkey.
That's the gangster
who used the knife on you.
And he'd just as soon kill Nick
or me or you as take a drink.
Now, you're much too nice a kid
to get mixed up in a racket like that.
But it hasn't hurt you any.
Thanks, Galahad.
Well, you're certainly...
I know, but you see,
Nick's always been swell to me.
He's one of the grandest guys
in the world.
But if he likes me,
I'll get along all right too.
It wouldn't hurt to try for a while anyway.
I can always quit when I get enough money.
You see,
I've always wanted a farm of my own.
- And this is a chance to...
- I know.
Well, at least I got it off my chest.
Maybe I was feeling
a little too Girl Scout-y today.
Would you come and see my first fight?
Sure.
Seems I'm always ringside
at the first fight.
And the last.
MAN 1:
Can we get the pail?
MAN 1:
Can we get the pail?
- He got flattened.
MAN 2: Okay.
MAN 3: Come on, hurry up. Step on it.
And watch outside.
Get working on him. He's out like a light.
MAN 4: Isn't that two already?
MAN 5: What happened to him?
MAN 6:
He led with his chin all the way.
MAN 1:
Hello, Chuck.
- Good luck, kid.
- Thanks.
- Hello.
- Hello.
MAN 2: Hi, McGraw.
MAN 3: Nice fight the other night.
- Hello, Chuck.
- Hello, John.
So you're gonna get your puss knocked in
for talking out of turn, huh?
We'll see about that.
We'll see how you talk
when you come back.
That is, if you can talk at all.
I only wish I was in there working on you
instead of my brother.
- I'm not gonna fight your brother.
- That's what you think.
I don't like this, Nick.
Who asked you to like it?
Take care of him in the ring.
All right, kid, on your toes.
Meet Silver Jackson.
He'll be in the ring with you.
- How are you, sir?
- Come on, let's go.
Why didn't you tell me
I was gonna fight McGraw's brother?
He's just a preliminary.
He's the only boy that I could get.
How good is he?
Oh, you've got nothing to worry about.
He's a kiyoodle.
All you've gotta do is to hang that right
on his spinach box and he'll fold.
Just leave everything to me.
Come on, let's go.
Give him the works.
Leave it to me.
What's McGraw doing in there?
The kid can't fight him. He'll murder him.
Well, that was the idea, wasn't it?
Oh, that's right.
You weren't in the room when they fixed it.
- Who fixed it?
- Nick and Turkey.
Nick did that?
Sit down.
You know better than to try to change it.
- You going into mourning for him?
- No, it's my fault he's in there.
You can't help it
if he was ofty enough to slug Chuck.
Well, he did it for me.
Okay.
So do you have to take him to raise?
Ladies and gentlemen,
the third event of the evening.
Four rounds of boxing.
In the black corner,
1 97 and a half, Sam McGraw.
And in the white corner,
1 91 pounds, Ward Guisenberry.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
Hey, kid. How do you feel?
Kind of sick.
You get that way at first.
Don't let it bother you.
Thanks, sir.
[BELL RINGS]
MAN:
Come on, Guisenberry!
Come on, come on!
[MOUTHS]
Yes- Come on-
[BELL RINGS]
He's a lot tougher
than Mr. Donati thought, huh?
You're plenty game, kid.
Thanks, Silver.
You won't get hurt so much
if you circle to the left away from his right.
Use your right as a threat.
Don't throw it so much.
- And work on his head.
- All right.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
[BELL RINGS]
Ward.
Nick, stop them. It's awful.
Please stop them.
Forget it, will you?
I wanna see what he's got.
Matched against a preliminary boy.
He's got a licking coming to him anyway.
You tossed him in to be slaughtered...
...because Morgan and McGraw
don't like him.
- Maybe I don't like him either.
- You're brutal. He can't stand any more.
What's the matter?
You getting stuck on him?
Oh, boy, he's got him!
- What happened?
- He hit him with a right.
What a socko!
One, two...
- Get up, Sam.
- Come on, Sam.
REFEREE:
Five, six...
...seven, eight...
...nine, ten.
[CROWD CHEERING]
- What are you gonna do?
- We've gotta get him out of town.
If Turkey and Morgan get hold of him,
they'll kill him. That kid's dynamite.
- He's got the makings of a champion.
- You said you didn't like him.
Do I have to like him to make him champ?
Come on.
- Just a minute, will you?
- Excuse us.
Hey, Silver, kid, wait.
Let's get out of here.
- Did I do all right?
- You did all right, but don't let's talk.
Well, what's up, Nick?
- What happened?
- Don't talk, listen.
Get out of town.
Both of you go with Fluff.
They may watch the stations.
Pile into my car and drive up to Palm Beach.
Grab a train for New York.
I'll be up there next week.
Get the kid some clothes on the way.
Go on, now, beat it.
But we can't leave you holding the bag.
They'll say you crossed them up.
- We gotta prove you didn't.
- And get the kid knocked off?
Forget it. I'll take care of those mugs.
Say, I'm gonna make you
heavyweight champion of the world.
- Come on, now, beat it!
- All right, bye.
Come on, let's go.
Oh, there you are. Where's the kid?
Hasn't he come back yet?
Where'd he go?
How should I know? Come on in here.
Where's that bellhop?
I've been looking for him myself.
Must have been afraid of you guys
and taken a powder.
Did you sign him up before the fight?
What, and use Sam for his first knockout
to get him a great big publicity break?
That would've been double-crossing you.
Yeah? When did you
double-cross your mother last?
Hey, lay off.
Nobody in this game mentions my family.
I keep them out of it.
Trying to crawl out from under, Nick?
No.
When I start paying you back,
it won't be on Sam.
I'll take a fall out of your champion.
Paying me back for what, Nick?
Handing Burke 25 grand to take a dive.
When I have to get it that way,
I'll quit the game.
You may quit sooner than that
if the kid was signed up.
Well, why don't you ask him?
I will.
I'm sorry. I guess I'm not good company.
That's all right. You needed rest.
Yeah.
I've been in a kind of daze
ever since I climbed into the ring.
- Where's Silver?
- He turned in.
Gee, the air's getting cool and fresh,
isn't it?
Mm-hm. Better get your fill of it.
From now on, you're going to be living
on a diet of cigar smoke...
...and gymnasium fumes.
You don't like the fight game much,
do you?
I used to. Seems I've changed.
You know, I really should be all hopped up.
You were a sensation tonight.
Well, I didn't feel like one. Oh, boy.
Every time McGraw hit me,
I thought I was gonna lose my teeth.
I was only hoping to finish
without getting knocked out.
Believe me,
that was gonna be my last fight.
What do you think about it now?
Well, it looks like
I might make some money at it.
I don't think I'm gonna like
some of the people.
You're right.
Do you wanna be a champion?
Anybody would wanna be a champion,
wouldn't they?
Sure. I suppose so.
Even I wanted to be one once.
I was going to panic New York
with dance and song.
So I ended up with featured billing
in a Bronx cabaret.
Where's the Bronx?
Well, from 42nd Street,
it's on the way back to the country.
You know, I don't see
why they wouldn't be crazy about you.
You're very beautiful,
you have lots of charm and...
Maybe I picked the wrong song.
I'd like to have you sing sometime for me,
Miss Phillips.
Don't call me Miss Phillips.
That makes me feel old.
My name's Louise.
- I'll bet you're not much older than I am.
- Oh, don't be silly.
Louise.
Why don't they call you that
instead of Fluff?
Guess it doesn't fit.
I haven't heard that name
for a long time.
Well, I guess I'll take another nap too.
- Well, what do you think of it, kid?
- Sure a lot of people.
They'll all be talking about you someday.
Maybe.
Kind of gives you an empty feeling.
Mm-hm. That comes
when they forget about you again.
- Well, here you are, Galahad.
- Yeah.
FLUFF: You two boys can sleep together.
- All right.
Morgan.
- How did you get here?
- Flew up.
After that powder you took, you shouldn't
have come back to your old hotel.
- Did you sign up with Donati?
- No.
In that case, I wanna have
a little business talk with you.
- Come on.
- No, you don't. You leave...
Keep out of this.
If you know what's good for you,
you'll sign up with me.
I'm not fighting for anybody but Donati.
Beat it.
- Come on.
- I said, beat it!
FLUFF:
Come on. Come on, get back to the cab.
WARD: Where we going, Fluff?
FLUFF: Never mind that now, just get on in.
Straight ahead, driver.
Listen, Ward, for three years, I've kept
Nick from taking a swing at that man...
...and now you do it.
I'm sorry. But I thought you said...
Well, I didn't tell you
to take a sock at him.
Now the whole mob
will be out looking for you.
- Silver, what are we going to do?
- We gotta get him out of town.
- I know, but where?
- Anywhere, until Nick...
Say, what's the matter
with Mrs. Donati's farm?
Are you crazy?
With his mother and sister there?
Nick would hit the ceiling if a fighter
came within a mile of them.
His sister's still in the convent.
- Is she?
- Yes.
Besides, Nick wouldn't mind Mrs. Donati
meeting an ex-farmer like the kid here.
Gets lots of exercise
and plenty of food up there.
- All right, Silver, you take him there.
- All right.
- Grand Central, driver.
- Okay.
- Listen, you're seeing the world.
- That farm sounds mighty good to me.
Aren't you coming?
Oh, no, no. I've never met his mother.
I think I'll stay here and take a rest cure.
Nick will be back next week.
I thought if he could stay until then...
Of course, a friend of my son
is always welcome.
- How is my bad Nicky behaving?
- Fine.
He's so little at home. Does he look well?
WARD:
Oh, he looks fine, Mrs. Donati.
Well, he's a nice boy.
He does not look like a prizefighter.
Well, he wasn't until the other night.
He used to be a farmer.
A farmer?
That is good.
And he needs lots of exercise.
You make him work hard for his food.
Don't worry.
Well, I'll have to be leaving
if I'm gonna catch that train.
Will you not stay for breakfast?
- Oh, I'm afraid I'll be late.
- Oh, you are just like Nicky.
Rush, rush.
You come. Hello. Goodbye.
Bop! You are gone.
Don't worry, I'll come back
and eat my way through your kitchen.
- A promise?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Goodbye again.
- Goodbye.
- So long, son.
- Goodbye, Silver.
Say, watch your weight.
- Lay off the starches.
- All right.
- Good luck.
- Come on.
- Come in.
- Thank you.
You're very kind.
From now on, I will call you Ward.
That last name is too big for me.
Maria.
Yes, Mother, breakfast is ready.
MRS. DONATl:
Maria's my daughter.
Come here.
This is Ward Washberry.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Oh, me, I don't got that name right yet.
But he will stay with us
until Nicky comes from Florida.
He's a prizefighter.
Oh, a fighter?
How interesting.
- How is Nicky?
- Fine.
I mean, he's fine.
He will have Nicky's room.
You show him and I'll get the food ready.
Ready. Come on.
MARIE: Come with me?
- I'm glad to.
What a name you have. I will never get it.
Thanks.
This used to be Nicky's room.
WARD:
Oh, this is swell.
I didn't know fighters liked farms.
I used to live on one.
Really? That's very interesting.
You've had a lot of experience
for a man so young.
WARD:
Guess I have.
How did Nicky happen
to send you up here?
Oh, Nick didn't send me.
Louise and Silver did.
- Who is Louise?
- Louise Phillips.
She's a friend of Nick's.
She brought me up from Florida.
- Oh, you came up together?
- Uh-huh.
What does she look like?
Oh, she's very beautiful.
- Blond?
- Yes.
With large, soft blue eyes, huh?
Yes. Do you know her?
No, I just imagined what she'd be like.
- What do you mean?
- Oh, nothing.
I didn't know fighters
needed female bodyguards.
Well, Silver was with us on the train
all the time.
How nice.
- I'll get you some linen.
- Looks like we're gonna get along fine.
You think so?
- How do you do, sir?
- How are you?
That fighter of yours did all right
knocking out Sam McGraw.
Put your money on him all the way.
You'll retire at 30.
- He was a bellhop, wasn't he?
- Yeah.
I've been doing a lot of fighting...
Yeah, the only way to take care
of all you guys is to start a war.
- Nick.
- Hello, Fluff.
You got my wire.
I didn't get any wire.
Morgan flew up here, didn't he?
Sure. He was waiting
with a gun and a contract.
- What happened?
- Ward knocked him cold.
- He did?
- Sure.
What a guy.
It wouldn't have been funny
if we hadn't gotten him out of town.
Maybe, but we can get him back. I know
how to handcuff Morgan in this town.
Listen, Nicky.
Why don't you stop
before you get started?
- On what?
- The kid.
There are a lot of mugs
you can make into fighters.
Send him back to the farm.
I'm gonna knock Morgan and McGraw
off their perch if it's the last thing I do.
I've got the right guy
and I'm gonna use him.
Even if it wrecks him?
Forget it, will you?
Once he's started he'll be crazy about it.
- Where is he?
- At your mother's farm.
- What are you trying to pull?
- Nothing.
There wasn't any other place
I could take him.
You know I keep Marie away
from mugs who lead this life.
- I know, but she's at the convent.
- No, she's been home for two months.
Really? Well, I didn't know that, Nicky.
Honestly I didn't.
I'm sorry.
- What are you gonna do?
- Get him out of there.
Mugs.
MARIE:
I suppose she isn't interested in you.
WARD:
Of course not. We're just good friends.
You certainly must have a way
with women.
Even Mother thinks you're wonderful.
Did you come out to feed your chickens
or start another argument?
Am I annoying you?
Yes.
[MARIE LAUGHING]
You'd probably have a much better time
with Louise.
- You've got the wrong idea about Louise.
- Maybe you have.
I don't care what you or anybody thinks.
I think she's swell.
What makes you think so?
Well, she's given me
a lot of good advice.
She's helped me a lot.
A big sister too.
How sweet.
With a mother as nice as yours, I don't see
how you could turn out the way you have.
- You don't like me?
- I think you're a spoiled brat.
Now will you get out of here?
Hello, Marie.
Nicky.
Oh, Nicky.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
- How have you been?
- Just fine.
Well, you're growing up, bambina-
You grow prettier every time I see you.
- That's not very often.
- Yes, I know.
- You finished the convent, huh?
- Uh-huh.
Why didn't you come to graduation?
You promised me you would.
I know I did,
but I was busy in town with a fight...
Where's the kid?
- Your fighter?
- Yes.
He's out there by the barn.
Tell me, do you like him?
Not in the least.
That's good.
Now, you remember what I told you.
I don't want you ever getting mixed up
with mugs.
You can take him away
anytime you feel like it.
I'm going to.
- Hey, Gooseberry.
WARD: Yeah?
Get your stuff together.
We're going back to town.
That's swell. Ha!
Am I glad!
- Where's Mom?
- She's in the kitchen.
I bet she's cooking, huh?
I'll go in and surprise her.
Wanna come in?
No, I have some work to do.
Well, I'll see you next time I'm up.
I'm proud of you.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Nicky.
[BOTH SPEAKING IN ITALIAN]
Mama.
I'm all ready, Mr. Donati.
What you mean?
Where you going?
He's gotta go back to New York,
Mom.
Nicky, you mustn't take him away.
He's very happy here.
That's what I thought,
but you wouldn't understand about that.
I'll come up and see you next week.
Are you not gonna stay even for lunch?
No, next time.
Next time,
I fix for you scallopini a la marsala.
Oh, Mom,
you make it tough for me to go...
...but I'll see you next week. I promise.
Promise, promise, always promise.
- Well, come on, let's go, kid.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Donati.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too.
I wanna thank you
for all you've done for me.
- You come back to see us?
- Well...
I'd like to.
I'll try, Mrs. Donati.
Goodbye.
God bless you and keep you safe.
Thank you.
NICK:
Come on, let's go.
[BOTH SPEAK IN ITALIAN]
- You come next week.
- Oh, sure.
- Don't forget your promise.
- No, no, no, I promise.
Oh, Mama.
I never catch cold with this.
[BOTH SPEAKING IN ITALIAN]
Come on.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
I'm grateful
I had a chance to stay at your home.
Yeah.
I hated to say goodbye to your mother.
You better forget about them both
from now on.
Why?
I don't like fellows hanging around them,
especially guys in the racket.
All right.
If that's the way you feel about it.
Yeah.
From now on, keep your mind on fighting.
We got a lot of work ahead.
Okay.
Hold it. Over this way.
How about a little smile?
Let's see those pearls. That's it.
Thank you.
Now we'll have a few more shots.
- Nick, we want you in here.
NICK: Alrighty, boys. Anything to oblige.
Get that cigar out of your face.
I was afraid
that you were gonna forget me.
TAYLOR:
How about that great big grin?
Ready?
Boy, the dames will pin that one
on the wall.
How about a statement
on that McGraw fight?
Nick does all the talking.
I told him any time you guys
put on the vacuum to stay muzzled.
- Nick is gonna make the statements.
MAN: Pay no attention, Guisenberry.
That name.
Why don't you get him a new one?
"Guisenberry lands a hard right."
"Guisenberry lands two lefts to the chin."
You'll have those announcers
choking to death.
- Yeah, that's right.
- Give out with a new one.
Sure, Nick makes all the statements.
You know it.
Wait a minute. We've got one.
Fluff, what was that name
we called him in Florida?
- Galahad.
- That's it, Galahad.
From now on, we call him Galahad.
MAN:
That's a pretty good name.
Listen, all of you.
We might just as well do it right.
I dub thee Kid Galahad.
And these, my colors,
you shall wear into battle.
Grab that.
Hey, what is this?
Why, that's the accolade.
Looks like a kiss to me.
Hey, Joe, kill that picture, will you?
We can't sell Galahad to the dames
with a gal hanging around his neck.
Kill that shot.
MAN: We'll save it till he does
tumble for a dame.
Oh, no, no,
he ain't gonna fall for any dame.
Why, that's your buildup, boys.
Galahad, clean of heart,
gallant rescuer of fair ladies...
...but no woman in his life.
The strength of 1 0 men because no dame
can get close enough to give him a haircut.
Roman gladiator.
What do you mean, Roman gladiator?
Well, what was he, a Greek?
No, Nicky, he was English.
A knight of the Round Table.
Yeah? Oh, well, what's the difference?
Swell bill of goods in any language.
Gentlemen of the press,
I give you Kid Galahad.
That Galahad gag of yours
sure worked out great.
Take a look at the dames.
Yeah.
- Keep it up, Joe, will you?
- It's a pleasure.
You know, the pure flower of knighthood,
all that mahoskus, huh?
Another terrific right. Two more.
[CONTINUES O VER RADIO]
They come... Oh, he's down-
Denbaugh's down-
Two, three,
Galahad shot clear across the ring-
The count is five, six,
caught Denbaugh coming out-
A terrific right-hand punch
that came from nowhere-
Then two more, nine, ten- He's out-
Another knockout for Kid Galahad-
Is this crowd going crazy!
The referee has Galahad's hand up and
this victory puts him on the road to the top-
- That was great.
- Great.
Keep coming, pretty boy. It's a date.
Hey, go on, now.
Keep your paws off him.
- It's a date and he'll knock your block off.
- You asking for something?
Keep this monkey in his cage.
He'll get his chance. Go on.
MAN 1: You're next, McGraw. Good luck.
- Come on, Kid.
MAN 2: They almost tangled-
We couldn't hear what they said-
Looked bad for a minute,
but it's all over now-
McGraw's climbing into the ring
and the crowd...
I thought you didn't like Ward.
I don't.
Then you shouldn't worry so much.
MARIE:
Oh, it's just nervousness.
You should always speak the truth,
Maria.
I am, Mother.
If you speak the truth...
...maybe it is just as good Nicky told Ward
not to come back anymore.
Nicky had no business doing that.
He can't...
Oh.
He will come back someday.
No, he won't.
He's too loyal to Nick to disobey him.
Maybe someday
we'll go to see Ward instead.
Nicky is a manager of box fighters,
not of people's hearts.
I go to bed now.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mother.
When you make up your mind,
you will be much happier.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I'm going to lunch, Miss Phillips.
Do you want anything?
You might bring me another pot of paste
and three more albums.
All right.
- Hello there.
- How are you?
- Hello, Fluff.
- Hello, Silver.
- Where's Nick?
- Don't ask me.
He may be in conference
with O'Brien and his manager.
They've been in his hair
trying to arrange for an early fight.
Silver, can O'Brien take Ward?
O'Brien's grandmother could take him if he
had one and she could stand on her feet.
- What's happened to him?
- I don't know.
- He's been out of line for a week.
- Oh, then he isn't hurt.
No, he just don't show
any pep in his work.
This morning he was punching the bag
like it was his best friend.
You know, sort of daydreaming?
Right in the middle of it,
he pulls off his gloves and walks out.
Well, maybe he's just homesick.
No, he acts more like he's in love
and not getting anywhere.
Say, Fluff, have you been seeing
very much of him lately?
- Oh, he'd never be in love with me.
- Don't kid yourself.
- They don't come any better than you.
- It's just the makeup.
I've known you a long time.
They can't beat aces.
- Thanks, Silver.
- Tell Nick to give me a call, will you?
- I will. Bye.
- Bye.
Whoo.
Hello, Kid.
What are you doing, following me?
I'm sorry I walked out on you
this morning.
- I'll snap out of it.
- Oh, that's all right, Kid.
Every fighter gets the yips
once in a while.
You have been working pretty hard.
- Take a couple of days off and relax.
- I'd like to.
- Be all right if I laid off till Monday?
- Sure, I'll fix it with Nick.
All right.
- Hello, Louise.
- Oh, hello, Ward.
Looks like Nick's doing all right
with the papers.
If he does much better,
we're going to have to enlarge the office.
"Kid Galahad mobbed by women."
Well, looks as if they lost control again.
Yeah. Wasn't much fun.
You know, you're suffering
from an acute case of publicity.
- Silver says it's got you down.
- It isn't that.
It's what I came to talk to you about.
I'd feel a lot easier
if I could get it off my chest.
You know, ever since we met in Florida,
you've always told me where I stood.
Yes?
There's no use talking to Nick about it.
And so I guess you're the only one
who can tell me.
It's about the time
I was down on Mrs. Donati's farm.
You see, I met his sister up there, Marie.
- Yes.
- I haven't seen her since.
Nick told me to stay away from her...
...and I guess he's got some right to say
about his own family...
...but I haven't been able to forget her.
I'm in love with her.
You know how Nick feels about that.
Does she love you?
I don't know. Maybe not.
But I wanna see her again.
If I did, it would be the first time
I've ever double-crossed Nick...
...and I owe everything I have to him.
What do you think?
You should go and see her, Ward.
Nick hasn't any right
to interfere with your happiness.
Besides, you've been on the level
with him all the way.
I'm glad you think so.
- I'm going up to see her tomorrow.
- Good luck.
If I could find the same happiness
you and Nick have, that's all I'll ever want.
You've been swell, Louise.
Thanks. Thanks for the advice.
I'll see you when I get back.
- Hey, Fluff.
FLUFF: Yes, Nick?
Dig out a party dress and put it on.
We're in for a celebration.
The O'Brien fight is signed and sealed.
And boy,
did I give those cute guys a muscling.
Forty-five percent
and stalled them till October.
We won't have to meet McGraw
till next year.
I'll tie the kid's right to his side,
teach him enough...
...to box them dizzier than drunk ducks.
Why, you and I are go...
- What's the idea?
- Nicky.
- I'm leaving.
- Lea...?
What do you mean, a trip? Where?
No, it's not a trip.
I'm quitting, Nick.
I'm all washed up.
What are you talking about? Washed up?
Why, we're sitting on top of the world.
After all we...
Say, what's the matter with you?
Have you gone crazy?
No.
Nicky, I've never lied to you
and I'm not going to begin now.
I'm in love.
Like a dizzy fool, I've fallen in love.
That finishes us.
I'm licked.
And I wanna get away from everything.
- Who is he?
- Ward.
You mean the kid?
Why, you...
Has he been crossing me up with you?
- Let's have it, I'll break his...
- Nicky, listen to me.
He hasn't done anything.
He doesn't know anything about it.
I've never told him.
Oh, he's square with you.
He always will be.
Oh, no. You're lying.
He fell for you the first time he saw you.
- You two started this coming up on the...
- No, Nicky, that's not true and you know it.
Now, listen.
These have been swell years.
Let's not spoil them now.
It's just the breaks,
and we can't do anything about it.
You or me either.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hello, this is 1 234.
Send up a couple of boys
for my luggage, will you?
Yes, it's ready now. All right, thanks.
We've gone a long way together,
haven't we?
Yeah. I'll never forget that, Nick.
No matter where I go.
Right now, I wanna get off by myself.
I don't even wanna see Ward.
Well, why not, if you're in love with him?
Because...
Because, you see...
He...
Well, he isn't in love with me,
and he never will be.
But he'll be around all the time...
...and well, I can't just take it.
Maybe I can forget him.
Well, what are you going to do?
Go back to work for Rocky.
- He's opening a new club downtown.
- Singing?
Well, will you be around at the fights?
No, Nick.
Goodbye, Nick.
See you around, Fluff.
If I can ever help you...
WARD: Hello, Marie.
MARIE: Hello, Ward.
- How are you?
- I'm fine.
That's good.
- How's your mother?
- She's fine.
That's fine.
I just thought I'd drive up, you know,
to see how you all were.
- It's nice of you to think of us.
- I'm glad you think so.
I...
- You've sort of changed, haven't you?
- How?
I thought you was gonna tear my head off
for coming up here again.
No, I'm glad you came.
I wanted to apologize
for the way I treated you last time.
- I was rude and...
- I wasn't much of a rose myself.
No, you weren't.
Especially when you called me a brat.
Oh, I know I got sore a couple of times...
...but you shouldn't have started
all those arguments.
- I didn't start any arguments.
- You certainly did that day out in the barn.
Wouldn't have called you a brat
if you hadn't kept harping.
Kept harping?
That's all you talked about.
- Louise did this, Louise said that.
- You had her wrong.
Certainly I had her wrong.
According to a man, every woman
has every other woman wrong.
It's a wonder you came up here at all,
with her still in New York.
- I suppose you've been seeing her.
- Of course I've been seeing her.
What of it? She's a swell...
- Friend, I've heard that before.
- You bet you've heard it before.
Before we do any more arguing,
I'm gonna get this off my chest.
Louise advised me to come up here.
The reason I came up here
was to tell you I love you.
I been in love with you
ever since I met you, brat or no brat.
And I wanted to propose to you.
Now, do you want to go on arguing or not?
No.
All right.
Oh, Ward.
SILVER: Too tight?
WARD: No, okay.
What's the matter, Nick?
- What do you mean?
- I don't know, whatever's eating you.
This is the first fight I've gone into
that I don't feel you're behind me.
- Oh, you got the jumps, that's all.
- No, I haven't.
Listen, Nick, ever since the Denbaugh fight,
you've had something against me.
Now, why don't you get it
off your chest?
Did you and Fluff ever think
you were in love with each other?
Louise? Certainly not.
Whatever gave you that idea?
You left town
the day after she walked out.
Do you think that I had anything to do
with her leaving?
- Wasn't she with you?
- Of course not.
Now, that's a fine question
for you to ask me.
She's a swell girl and you know it.
We're just good friends, that's all.
- Where did you go?
- Well, I drove up to New London.
I didn't even know she'd left
until I got back.
Okay, forget it.
Keep your mind on tonight.
I'll be in there backing you up.
Remember, stay on that bicycle
and box O'Brien the whole distance.
And don't look too good or Turkey will
have them yelling for you to meet Chuck.
- Main event coming up.
NICK: We're coming.
Keep that right hand tied up,
win on points.
- I don't want any knockout, understand?
- All right.
Oh, Silver.
If you see Fluff anyplace, let me know.
I thought she wasn't coming
to fights anymore.
Well, she might change her mind.
Get on the next fight!
[CROWD BOOING]
MAN 1:
Come on, Galahad.
MAN 2:
Come on, Galahad, fight!
Stall, huh? They got him on a bicycle.
If he keeps on looking that bad,
you won't pump up any fight.
That's it, box him.
I'll fix it so he'll open up next round.
- I thought Chuck was gonna be here.
BUZZ: Well, he said he would.
He think he can beat this guy without
watching? I told you to stay with him.
How did I know he was lying?
Probably ducked out for some nightclub.
Yeah, well, if he did,
I'll bat his ears down.
I wanna get ahold of him later.
MAN:
Come on, Galahad.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, plenty burned up.
Follow him after the fight.
It'd be a swell shot if he finds
the champ and kicks him out.
Hop to it and get the lowdown.
[BELL RINGS]
There you are. That was perfect, Kid.
- You're going great.
- Crowd don't like it.
Who cares?
All we want is the championship.
Keep at it, will you?
If you run McGraw as ragged as this guy,
he'll fall from an attack of gin.
- All right.
- Duke.
Yeah?
Wanna make the Kid come in
slugging so you can nail him?
Yeah, I'll say I do.
- Make a crack about Fluff Phillips.
- Fluff Phillips, huh?
Thanks a lot.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
What you doing?
Saving yourself for that Fluff dame?
Hey, lay off that, Kid. Box him.
What do you think you're doing?
Stay away from him, Kid, will you?
Five, six, seven...
...eight, nine, ten.
Tell him he's washed up.
SILVER: You can't do it, not to this boy.
- Stepped out of line, didn't he?
Yes, but you can't...
I'm as through with him
as Burke or any of them.
But this isn't the same.
You can't give Turkey
another chance to double-cross you...
...when you got this boy to pay him off.
Yeah, I forgot that.
- Okay, you win.
- Swell, Nick.
What do you think about it, Turkey?
Well, it was a great fight.
The Kid's a sensation.
He's proved to the public and to us
he's ready for a title shot.
We'll match him
with the champion next month.
- Swell.
- Hey, Donati.
- Oh, Taylor.
- Yeah?
You might tell them about the Kid
knocking Chuck out with one punch.
The old grudge-fight buildup.
The public will wanna see him next week.
- That Florida business was off the record.
- Well, he's my fighter, ain't he?
- Put it on the record.
- Okay, leave it to me.
Oh, Fred. Fred.
- Hey, what was the idea?
- He said something about Louise.
Yeah? Kind of getting
out of hand, aren't you?
- No, but I'll slug anybody that says it.
- Hey, Donati.
- Wait a minute.
- Wait a second.
- All right, go ahead.
SILVER: Come on.
Great fight, wasn't it, boys?
I let the Kid have a good long-range
workout before putting the KO on him.
Wait, give us that later.
Morgan wants to give you
a championship fight next month.
- That okay with you?
- You know the public's hot for it.
- It'll draw a terrific gate after this win.
- Come on, give out.
- When are you gonna sign?
- You're out of luck.
There will be no signing until next year.
MAN 1:
Anything at all?
MAN 2: Please...
- Now, now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, you guys are just
as wise as I am to Turkey's frame-up.
He knows Galahad, as soon as
he reaches his peak, will take McGraw.
He's trying to knock the Kid off now.
You're gonna have the mob
yelling for a match.
MAN 3: Yeah, we gotta print something.
- Okay.
Now, wait a minute. Let me see.
You tell them that Nick Donati...
...appeals to the sportsmanship
of the American public for fair play.
To wait and give Kid Galahad a chance.
Why, Chuck is in a class
by himself right now. The Kid?
He needs a lot of training before meeting
such a magnificent fighter as the champion.
- That ought to hold them.
- That's fine.
Yeah, that's all right, Nick. Thanks.
- Where's Turkey?
- All right, let's go get Morgan.
Let's christen the coming champ.
I'll break this bottle over his head.
- Hey...
- Oh, can't I launch the guy?
SILVER: You can't do that.
- How about you having a little drink?
SILVER:
I'll see you outside.
Oh, let me christen him just once.
MAN:
How about it, Kid? When did he cave?
WADE:
It was the fifth round I started slugging.
- Here's a note for you.
- Thanks.
It was your first right that hurt him?
What are you talking about?
It was the second.
- How about a statement, huh?
- Yeah, how about a statement?
Wait a minute.
- Marie, darling, how are you?
- Just fine.
Gee, this is a surprise.
How did you get in town?
Mother let me come down on the train.
- Did you see the fight?
- Mm-hm.
- Are you hurt?
- No.
You were wonderful.
Changed your mind
about the fight game, huh?
- Let's go someplace where we can talk.
- I just wanted to see you.
I have to leave on the 1 2:30 train.
I'll drive you home.
I'll get you there before the train will.
You've never been here before,
so let's take a look around tonight.
- All right.
- My car's right down here.
- Like it?
- Oh, yes.
- Ward?
- Yeah?
- I'd like to ask you something.
- All right.
Is it true that Louise told you
to come up to the farm?
Yes, it is, Marie.
I'm afraid I was wrong about her.
- She belongs to all this, doesn't she?
- That's right.
I'd like to meet her sometime.
She's singing at Rocky's.
You've never been to a nightclub,
have you?
- You like to stop in and get a bite to eat?
- Oh, I'd love to.
All right.
[SINGING]
That's Louise singing.
She's lovely, isn't she?
Table for two, please.
- Oh, how do you do, Mr. Galahad?
- How are you?
This way, please.
- I heard it was a wonderful fight.
WADE: Yeah, well, we had a lot of fun at it.
MAN:
Here you are.
- Hello, Louise.
- Hello, Galahad.
- I like your singing.
FLUFF: Thanks.
Remember,
you always wanted to hear me sing.
- You're Nick's sister, aren't you?
- Yes, Louise.
I've known your brother for a long time.
- Will you sit here with us?
- Yes, sit down.
FLUFF:
Sure, I'd love to.
Thanks.
WADE:
Will you have something with us, Louise?
No, no, I don't think I will.
Does Nick know you're in New York?
No, he doesn't.
You won't tell him, will you?
Oh, no, of course not.
I hear you made short work of O'Brien.
Guess you're gonna be a champion
after all.
WADE:
If I do, it'll be my last fight.
Then Nick will have what he wants
and so will I.
Marie was at the fight tonight.
Did you enjoy it?
Very much, but I was a little worried.
The next thing she wanted to do
was to meet you.
I'm glad.
You know, a few months ago,
I didn't think I'd like you.
But I do, very much.
Same goes with me.
And you know, don't you?
Know what?
You wouldn't understand.
- Good evening, Mr. Morgan.
- Where's Chuck McGraw?
- Sorry, he's not to be disturbed.
- Don't give me that. Where is he?
Private dining room number 6,
but you did not hear it from me.
[LAUGHING]
Taking in a fight, eh?
- Come on, you. Get outside, go on.
WOMAN: Say, don't you dare touch her.
- Who do you think you are?
CHUCK: Hey, cut it out.
- Breaking up a...
- Give me my coat.
- The very idea, imagine the nerve...
TURKEY: Outside.
- Why, listen, who do you think you are?
TURKEY: Never mind, outside.
- What you sore about?
- I thought I told you to be at the ringside.
I don't have to see that hick fight.
I can knock him off anytime.
O'Brien couldn't and you won't be able to.
That's what they're stalling for.
Oh, so they're stalling?
Waiting for you to lap up
all the liquor in town.
- You're going back into training.
- I'll take care of that guppy.
Why don't you go lose yourself?
What you trying to do, grab an exclusive?
Come on, get out of here.
He won't do no stalling on me.
Shut up.
- I know what I'm doing.
- Come here.
Well, if it ain't old lambie pie,
all dolled up.
Ward, look out.
Chuck's drunk.
So you're trying to crawl out
in a fight, huh?
[WOMEN SCREAM]
Stand up, we'll have it out here.
No, Ward, please.
Listen, McGraw, I've had enough of you.
- Let go of me.
- I'll take you on anytime.
Wait a minute, hold on there.
Get him out of here.
- We'll make it next month.
- Suits me fine.
Okay, that's a date.
CHUCK: Let me throw a hook.
- You're throwing no hook at anybody.
- I'll smash that kid.
- You'll smash nobody, get him out.
Cut it out, boys, that's enough.
Come on, get her out and take her home
before it's too late.
- Thanks.
- I'm sorry.
Don't you worry about it,
it's gonna be all right.
Good night.
Please don't use those pictures.
If Joe Taylor didn't get that picture,
he'd murder me.
Oh, but...
Cochran, Brady talking.
Hold your run.
I'm gonna re-plate page one.
What a break on top
of that Florida hotel fight angle.
Stay with
"The Women in Galahad's Love Life."
That's what the squaws want for breakfast.
Smith, where are the pictures?
Well, bring them out wet.
I'm gonna jerk the war stuff on page two.
Save me four columns.
That picture of Phillips
kissing in the office ought to work.
Yeah, but who's the other girl?
A fine lot of newspaper men
we got around this place.
- Doesn't anybody know?
- You might ask Galahad.
- Lady to see you.
- Keep them all out, I'm busy.
- I'm sorry... You can't go in.
- Never mind, Joe.
Sorry, you're out of luck.
You got plenty
without playing up the fight angle.
Don't use those pictures.
You've got to keep them out.
And let the Express beat us?
Their guy was there too. I'm sorry.
But you don't realize what will happen.
It'll ruin the Kid, his whole career.
You don't know Nick. It'll be the end of
everything if you drag his sister into it.
His sister?
Yes.
- Didn't you know?
- No.
What a break.
Yo, Brady, Brady.
- Good morning, Mr. Donati.
- Morning.
- Hello, Nick.
- Oh, well. There he is.
We've been waiting here hours.
How many interviews do you boys want?
The Kid won't fight the champion
until next year.
What I wanna know is...
What about this romance
between the Kid and your sister?
- How long have they been going together?
- What romance?
Here it is, right here.
Goodbye, darling.
It was an exciting evening, wasn't it?
- You're here, huh?
- Why, I brought Marie home.
Not satisfied with messing yourselves up
in New York, have to come here.
- Don't say that.
- lf you followed us...
You haven't had enough. You had to sneak
behind my back to double-cross me.
- There's no double-cross.
- I told you to stay away.
- He's not gonna keep away from me.
- Marie and I are in love.
Love, what does she know about love?
She's a kid, she's too young.
- You don't know anything about me.
- Stay away from guys.
I'll do as I like.
What business is it of yours?
You're never here,
you've never lived at home.
Chasing around,
doing anything you want.
What I do
hasn't anything to do with you.
- You're different.
- I'm not different.
I have as much right to be happy as you.
If you think you're gonna keep me
cooped up here, you're crazy.
- Nicky.
- We love each other.
You can't keep us apart,
you haven't any reason to.
It's your own temper and dirty mind.
We hadn't done anything.
How do I know
what's been going on between you?
Nicky, don't say that, stop it.
Sneaking into the city.
How many times you been up there
with him, and what have you been doing?
I tried to keep you decent, didn't I?
Sent you to convent, kept you away
from guys. Where'd you end up?
Getting yourself smeared
over the front page of smut sheets...
...like a common rat.
You bad, bad boy.
I'm sorry I hit you, Nick...
...but you shouldn't have said
what you did to her.
I owe you a lot.
I've always obeyed your instructions,
and I'll go on obeying them.
But whatever I do outside the ring
is my own business.
All right,
I wouldn't worry about it if I were you.
MAN 1: Hello, Nick.
- Oh, hello, Joe.
MAN 2: Hi, Nick.
- Sit down, there's a place for everybody.
Warren, that's where you sit.
- Hey, Nick.
- Yeah?
What's the idea of the telephones?
I said when you heard the announcement,
you'd wanna get to a phone fast.
- Sit down, sit down, enjoy yourselves.
MAN 3: What's on your mind, Nick?
What's all this about?
Come on, Nick,
how long you gonna hold out on us?
MAN 4:
Oh, for Pete's sake, get it off your chest.
MAN 5:
Yeah, loosen up, give out, will you, Nick?
- All right, all right.
- Come on.
So you don't get indigestion.
Turkey Morgan's been shooting
his mouth off to get Kid Galahad...
...into an early match.
You birds said it would
draw a million-dollar gate.
All right, we're going after it.
We signed for the championship bout
next month.
Next month?
What'd you start all this for,
to pay me back for socking you?
NICK:
Forget the other night.
Our personal brawls haven't anything
to do with the fight game.
I thought you wanted to hold out
till next year.
Yeah, till I found out
how much McGraw has been drinking.
He can't get back in good shape
in four weeks.
With this feud in the papers,
that's good for a million-dollar gate.
I had an idea
you wanted to get rid of me.
If I didn't wanna take the title
from those guys...
...I'd have shoved you overboard for going
against orders and knocking out O'Brien.
Ask Silver, he talked me out of it.
That's right. Why'd you tell the newspapers
you're gonna send the Kid in slugging?
Because that's what he's gonna do.
McGraw's ripe for it.
You can punch harder,
you're in perfect shape, you can take it.
The sooner you wash him up,
the less punishment you'll take.
You get on for 1 2 rounds, you're gonna get
more chances to land a lucky punch.
- I don't like to argue...
- You're not going to.
Or else I get another trainer.
I don't want any sparring partners,
I want punchers.
I want you to send them in
punching all the time and him too.
- Listen, I never led you wrong yet, did I?
- No, you haven't, Nick.
Then listen to me
no matter what anyone else tells you.
McGraw asked for a shellacking
when he pushed you.
You said you'd pay him back for it,
didn't you?
- Yes.
- Okay, we sign this afternoon.
We'll meet
at the commissioner's office at 2:00.
All right.
So long, Nick.
Five thousand dollars
open on McGraw at 5-to-7.
MAN:
McGraw, 5-to-7.
- I'll take that.
- Okay, Barney.
Hello. Hello, Nick?
Barney speaking.
Yeah, I just placed the last of it.
Okay, Barney.
Say, tell me,
what's the reaction downtown?
Yeah? What are the boys offering?
Five to seven. Well, that seems a bit...
- Oh, come in.
- Yeah.
Keep in touch with me.
They tell me you're still
gonna send the Kid in slugging.
- Yeah.
- That's a good way to lose, ain't it?
Sure.
I just learned
you bet 50 grand undercover.
- Mm-hm.
- On McGraw to win.
That's right.
What are you trying to do, Nick?
Pull another fast one?
If I wanted to take the title away from you,
I wouldn't spend 50 grand to do it.
I'm dumping my fighter.
The more McGraw cracks him up,
the better I'll like it.
The old wheeze
that he double-crossed you, eh?
You read it in the papers.
Oh, yeah, your sister.
Yeah.
You ask me, take it or leave it.
I think I'll take it.
Bill, Turkey.
Bet another 1 50 grand
on McGraw to win.
No, I'm not crazy. Donati's backing it.
Yeah.
He better win.
He will.
If he don't,
you won't be around to talk about it.
Thanks for the tip.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at ringside.
The big moment is nearly here.
This promises to be the most
sensational battle of the year.
An enormous crowd's jammed
into this huge auditorium...
...to see Kid Galahad climb
into the ring...
...against Chuck McGraw,
the heavyweight champion.
Oh, he's going to be all right.
Now, don't you worry.
At a longest, it'll be over in an hour.
I know, but I'm afraid
Nick will get back at him.
Not while there's a chance of getting
that title from McGraw and Morgan.
- You don't think so?
- No, I'm sure of it.
Anyway, I'm glad it's his last fight.
Whose?
Ward's.
He's going to quit after this.
Does Nick know that?
No.
- lf you see Fluff anyplace, let me know.
- Oh, forget her, will you, Nick?
Come on.
Good luck, Kid.
[BELL RINGING]
Fifteen rounds of boxing...
...for the heavyweight championship
of the world.
In this corner,
at 1 99 and one-quarter pounds...
...the challenger, Kid Galahad.
[CROWD CHEERING]
In this corner,
at 205 and one-half pounds...
...defending his title tonight,
the heavyweight champion, Chuck McGraw.
[CROWD CHEERING]
He expects you to go slow
and feel him out.
Get him out of his corner
and give him the works.
All right.
Seems I'm always ringside
at the first fight and the last.
What did you say?
Oh, nothing,
it's just something I remembered.
Watch him, he'll come out slugging.
Remember what I told you:
Get him in the first round.
MAN:
Come on, boys.
You told him wrong.
Kid can go the distance, and McGraw's...
Hey, I know what I'm doing.
CHUCK:
This evens up for Florida.
One, two, three, four...
Stay away, Kid. Keep away from him.
Punch him. Go on and slug him.
Two, three, four, five...
...six, seven, eight, nine...
Come on, Kid, keep going in.
Punch, punch.
Don't you stop it.
Don't you stop it, referee.
He won't get hurt like that next round.
Nick knows it's the wrong way now.
Six, seven, eight, nine...
[BELL RINGS]
You had him down.
He threw everything he had at you.
- Punches can't knock you out.
SILVER: They can, if he sets himself.
He isn't gonna give him a chance to get
set. Keep hanging him up with that right.
In two rounds, that
liquor of his will slow him up.
All right, I'll get him.
- Three chances to finish him.
- I hit him with everything.
Throw them wild, you'll wear
your arms out. I told you to set yourself.
I'll mess that kisser some more.
Better do what Buzz says,
get hold of yourself.
[BLOWS WHISTLE]
[BELL RINGS]
Stay away. Stay away from him, Kid.
Two, three, four, five...
- Punch, slug into him.
- You're wrong, Nick.
I know what I'm doing.
You can't get away with it.
You're murdering the Kid.
He's gonna change to defense.
Defense, Kid, like I told you.
This is Silver, defense.
No, you're not going in there again.
You're out, fired.
Go on, get away from the ring.
All right.
Go on, punch, slug him.
ANNOUNCER:
Another terrific round, two more-
McGraw's battering him with everything
and the Kid is still standing up-
He's shown this crowd a gameness
that's seldom been equaled-
But he can't last much longer-
He's into McGraw again!
Still throwing them, but they're wild-
Shouldn't have sent him in slugging.
He's tried to carry the fight for the... Ooh!
McGraw steps in with a right
over the heart.
Galahad fell into a clinch.
Come on, let's get out.
Get him, like I told you, come on.
MAN:
Fight, come on, boys.
FLUFF: Nick.
- Fluff.
FLUFF:
Nick, you can't go on with this.
What are you doing here?
Never mind that.
I said you can't go on with this.
I know what I'm doing.
We know what you're doing too.
You're murdering that kid
because of Marie.
You're tossing him to Morgan
and those dirty wolves to satisfy a grudge.
You let that temper of yours throw you off
the deep end, like I always said it would.
Selling out that kid's trust and loyalty.
He's up there fighting his heart out for you,
keeping faith with you...
...because you helped him.
You told me that one day you'd find
a fellow that would go the distance...
...and take orders all the way,
and you'd make him a champ.
Don't do this to him
because he loves me.
You can't keep me a kid always.
I love him. I'll always love him.
Please, Nicky,
don't let him get hurt anymore.
Okay, go on back to your seats.
He'll be all right.
Thank you.
Smart. Come on, darling.
Mac, have 20 cops ready to get us back
from the ring to our dressing room.
Okay.
Barney, try and cover our bets.
- Fifty grand on Galahad.
- Have you gone nuts?
Do as I tell you.
Get as much extra down on him as you can.
- Okay.
- Oh, let me have your gun.
[BELL RINGS]
- How do you feel, Kid?
- Oh, I don't know.
Wake up, wake up.
What round is it?
Eighth coming up.
- I thought we were just beginning.
- That's it.
- Know me?
- Yeah, Nick.
That's it, Kid.
Now, listen, we're changing now,
understand? We're changing.
He shot his bolt. He's on his heels
and breathing through his mouth.
Now, stay away from him,
run him off his feet, stall him.
Rest up now, Kid.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
Rest up.
Don't forget, keep that left hand up high
and keep moving.
[BELL RINGS]
- Nick switched on us.
- Yeah.
A complete change of pace.
Galahad's boxing.
He's shooting them long range,
staying away, counter-punching.
He's making McGraw force the fight.
- Glad you changed, Nick.
- Yeah.
- Come on, you can go back after this round.
- Thanks.
Look, he means it.
He's sending Silver back in again.
[BELL RINGS]
Did you see him eat it up
when you staggered?
Now we go to work.
He thinks you're gone, he's wide open.
Pull it this round
when I give you the office.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
[BELL RINGS]
Archie.
We got a date when this is over.
Stand by.
Okay.
Two, three...
Four, five, six, seven, eight...
Two, three, four, five...
...six, seven, eight...
- Chuck, on your feet, come on.
...nine, ten.
MAN:
Back up, back up, back up.
You can't get in. All right. Back up.
Only the press,
wait a minute, wait a minute.
Fat chance of getting in.
Go get yourself a badge.
- You got a match?
- Yeah, I got one here.
Put them up.
Get back there.
[GUNSHOT]
Hey, the man's down. Help, help, police!
Police, police.
MAN 1:
How about it? Come on.
MAN 2: We need just a second.
MAN 3: Will you say a few words?
- Hey, they just shot a fellow outside.
- What?
Down in Tunnel B.
- Who did it?
- They don't know.
- Who got shot?
- Some insurance guy from Ohio.
First time in town.
- Oh, that's too bad.
- I'll say it is.
- Silver.
- Yeah, Nick?
- Get the Kid under the showers.
- Come on.
WARD: Yeah, I've had enough of this.
NICK: Get some medicine.
MAN:
Get out of the way, come on.
Pack my things, will you?
Marie's waiting for me.
- Okay, champ.
- Come on.
Get your hands up and turn around.
WADE: What's the idea?
- Get over there.
I should've taken care of you mugs
in Florida.
You ain't gonna catch no train
this time.
NICK: Come over to the hotel.
We're having a celebration.
You'll get all the dope you want.
- Take care of the champ now.
- Hey, Sully.
Watch this door,
don't let anybody come in.
All right, Nick.
- So long, see you later, boys.
- Good night, Nick.
Oh, I beg your pardon, Mr. Donati.
You gave all the other guys a break
before I got here.
You rushed the Kid out of the ring
before I could get shots.
Just one picture of you and the champ?
- You're from out of town?
- Yeah.
Just got a wire tonight to do the job on you
and, well, I'll get fired if I don't deliver.
It will only take a minute.
We can grab one in the shower room.
- Okay, anything for the press.
- Oh, thanks for the break.
Go on, get over there with them
and keep your hands up.
You, duck out that way.
This is my business.
Okay.
[LOCK CLICKS]
I've been aching to fill you full of slugs.
Use your head.
You can't get away with it in here.
There's cops all over the place.
I'll square it with you.
Yeah, like you always have.
You're starting to crawl, eh?
Anything, I'll settle with you any way
you want it, but leave those two alone.
So they can put the tag on me?
You're too used to a machine gun.
You might miss with that peashooter.
- lf we were to rush you...
- I'll settle with you, you double...
You shouldn't have thrown away
that machine gun.
- Nick.
- Get him over on the table.
MAN:
Open up.
Nick.
Well, get an ambulance, will you?
Get a doctor.
- Outside, boys.
- Go get Louise and Marie, will you?
Send an ambulance to the stadium.
Connect me with the Homicide bureau.
Nicky.
Nicky.
Hello, Marie.
There's an ambulance coming, Nick.
You'll be all right.
Oh, no, he wasn't that bad a shot.
Nicky, you've got to get well.
For Nina.
For all of us.
I was wrong, Marie, about the Kid.
I guess I been wrong
about a lot of things.
You two go on being happy,
being in love.
- Be careful how you tell Mama about this.
- I will.
Am I out of the doghouse?
Yes.
You know,
I never should have gone away.
Oh, forget it. It's just the breaks.
You've always been swell.
The Kid put up a great fight, didn't he?
Took us a long time, you and me...
...but we did what we set out to do.
We got a champ.
[ENGLISH SDH]
