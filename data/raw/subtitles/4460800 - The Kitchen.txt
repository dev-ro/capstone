Good morning!
You're with the Lord.
It's 7:00 a.m. You know what time it is.
It's the Lord,
Lord Kitchener, live and direct,
strong from the Kitchen on Kitchen Radio.
Bad news, guys. They've gone and done it.
Water in the West Wing is out.
I repeat, water in the West Wing is out.
Water is still available in the east,
but only go if you need.
Only go if you sweat in your sleep.
Only go if your mattress is drenched.
You hear me?
Get out!
Come on, man!
We can't be waiting all day.
- Come on!
- Hurry up, man.
Get out!
It ain't personal.
We want this.
Not you.
It's time
for birthday shout-outs.
Happy 45th birthday to Sherry-Ann.
Love from Todd,
Neilson, and the whole family.
You've got 30 minutes
to send in all your birthday shout-outs.
What a fucking...
About time, mate.
Finally. Better late than never.
Need to make a shower.
No water.
Seriously?
Messages coming in.
Remember that at 10:00 p.m...
{\an8}Isaac, after your eight-month wait,
your new Buena Vida
single-occupancy flat is ready.
- Yo, bust that door.
- Everyone together...
Okay, listen,
the food is coming in
on the north side of the market.
Food coming in north side of the market.
No! We don't want money!
If you've got extra tins,
stay back.
It's still there. It's still there.
Just wait. Wait.
Only go if you need.
Only go if you need.
We gotta look out for each other.
- Take it.
- Turn it off! Turn it off!
Take that! Take that!
- Hey!
- That's how we like it!
I've said it before,
and I'll say it again.
Take that.
They can't stop we.
You hear me?
At times like these,
it's important to think about yourself.
After your transition,
your tree will spend
a few weeks here in our incubator.
We call that the mourning period.
So, during that time,
family can visit as much as they like.
Where you going to put me?
The trees get sent
to a... ecological restoration project.
Somewhere you can, um... lay your roots.
- You don't have a clue.
- Dad!
I don't want to be a fuckin' bush!
Uh, Jase, um, do you mind showing
this family our selection of urns, please?
My pleasure. Could you just
follow me this way, please?
Won't have a grave to visit.
- Won't know where I am.
- Yo.
You're from the Kitchen, right?
Do you really think
your family wanna be here?
No.
Do you not think
if they could afford to do more,
they would do more?
I wish my dad prepared me
way more for his death.
'Cause it was like
one moment he's there, next minute gone,
and anything that was left around,
like money or whatever, had to go
all on a funeral.
You know?
You ever been to a Nigerian funeral?
Last one I went to lasted three weeks.
Exactly.
You know, imagine a nine night
on top of that.
You know, it's a lot.
What'd you say to him?
Dad's Nigerian funeral.
You're a cunt.
Well, commission ain't gonna make itself,
is it?
Serious?
Tellin' you, that's why I ain't staying
in that shithole
for one second longer
than I have to, mate.
"Shithole"?
- Yeah, shithole.
- It's our home.
"It's our ho..." You always say that.
Bruv, keep that same energy when
they drag you out kickin' and screamin'.
Yeah, but we're not doing that. They are.
Aight.
Cool.
I'm just letting you know, innit?
When shit gets real,
I'm saving myself out here.
They won't get the Kitchen.
They will get the Kitchen.
- It ain't happenin', fam.
- It's 'appening.
I'm telling you.
It is.
I don't give a shit anyway.
- Aight.
- Aight.
Toni was
a mother, friend, neighbor.
She will be missed so much
by everyone who knew and loved her.
Now I'd like to invite Toni's son forward
to say a few... final words.
Benji.
Would you like to say
a few words to your mum?
Earth to earth.
Roots to roots.
Life to life.
Come and see her
as much as you want... until she's moved on.
Yo.
How'd you know my mum?
- I don't.
- You was at the funeral.
I work here.
You don't look like
you was here because of work.
Yeah, I knew your mum.
From way back.
- Way back? Way back when?
- Yeah, just way back.
- When you were together?
- No.
- Sexually?
- What you... Oi, what you talking about?
Fuckin' barely knew your mum, man.
That's it.
What?
I just thought
my dad might've shown up today.
Guess he didn't.
Sick.
- This is your bike?
- Move from me, man.
- Can I have a go? I'm good on bikes.
- No. Move, man.
- Let me just show...
- Yo, yo, yo, move.
- Man, let me just show you.
- Hey, hey. Listen.
It was your mum's funeral today, man.
Yeah, I get it.
Don't wanna have to tell you
to fuck off.
What?
Do you wanna ride or not?
So where d'you live?
Kitchen.
The Kitchen?!
Yeah.
Why you say it like that? You know it?
Is it really like what they say it's like?
What? A shithole?
Yeah.
My mum...
She said my dad lives there.
I best go, Benji.
Thanks for the ride, Izi.

I'm tryin' to go home.
Hey, where we goin'?

Took him at least three or four times.
Kamale about ten times.

Eight and a half. Be precise.

Hmm?
Wanted to know what it's like, right?
Well, you'll find out

You ain't built like them.
Leave 'em alone.
Fine.
I'll stay away from them.
Yeah. Good.
Get down!
Get the fuck off me!
Only if you let me stay with you.
No.
I haven't got anywhere else to go.
It's either I stay here
or I stay with Staples.
Then you're staying with Staples.
Two nights.
Benji,
I'm getting outta this place myself,
so those two nights are two nights.
You're okay with that?
It's cool. Thank you.
What's this?
Pillow and a blanket.
This is a bag and a towel.
Yeah, well, things can be other things.
Are you just gonna be looking at me
takin' a shit?
I'm not even criticizin'.
Happy to be here.
This is the Lord.
Lord Kitchener,
live and direct,
strong from the Kitchen... on Kitchen Radio.
I know how you feel.
I feel it too.
They did it in Aylesbury.
They did it in Broadwater.
They did it in Mozart.
But remember,
they ordered us to leave,
and we said, "No. This is our home."
"We ain't goin' nowhere."
They cut our water,
they cut our supplies, and we said, "No."
"Fuck you. We ain't goin' nowhere."
Now,
the target is us.
The target is us.
I'm going to work.
You can take a shit now.
Izi.
Can you make sure my mum's all right?
Make sure she's gettin', um...
Make sure she's got water, sunlight,
sh... everything she needs.
If you can't get through
to someone, let me know.
You know what, man? Come on. Get up.
You're coming in with me.
I've said it before,
and I'll say it again,
and I will continue to say it
until I breathe no more.
They can't stop we.
They can only stop we
if we see we as I.
Let's change the vibe real quick.
Melanie?
Is it safe?
Benji, come on.
Go on, then. One more time.
Okay. Um... When my mum passed,
I'm so glad she upgraded
to... the Long Farewell...
- No, man.
- ...Package?
- You said you got it.
- I just said it.
The Fond Farewell Package.
- The Fond Farewell Package.
- Yeah.
Because... it eased the pain of her passing.
Robotic, man. Come on.
Say it one more time. Come on.
I don't even understand.
What's the Long Farewell Package?
- It's the Fond Farewell Package.
- Fond.
That's what's gonna
earn your keep around here. Yeah?
One more time. Go.
When my mum died,
I'm so happy I upgraded...
...to the Fond...
So... you can come and see her
as much as you want.
And this is our friend Benji here.
- Benji.
- Yeah.
Benji was just telling me about... his loss.
How his experience has been here.
Weren't you, Benj?
I'm so happy... that
I upgraded her...
to the... Long...
um, to the Fon...
Long...
I miss her.
I miss her every hour she's gone.
It feels like she's still kinda here.
I guess she is... this way.
'Cause she is.
Thanks for that, Benji.
Come this way.
Um, see you tomorrow.
Let's go.
I'll come back for you, Mum.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Sasha is 86 today!
I'm gonna play one for you, Sash.
I'm gonna play it for you as well, Rob,
because I want you to take time
with Sash. Sash is 86.
And everybody 'ere in the Kitchen
wants her to reach 87.
So, my brudda, take time.
What you gonna do
with those trees?
- Izi?
- You don't get to know that shit.
Why?
- They're just trees, man.
- Don't you legally have to tell people?
No, I don't.
You can find out.
- You can find out though.
- Argh!
You done good today.

There you go. Where? There? Okay.
You can have a bit of milk in your cup.
That's enough.
You got a daughter, bro.

Go on.
Big man.
Go and get the bike back.
But when they end up doin'
something stupid, like killin' a fed...
and you're there,
they will leave you.
Trust me. They will leave you.
Eat your fuckin' breakfast, man.
You left me.
Aight.
When I was your age,
who do you think looked after me?
Go on.
Who bought you that little red bike?
I didn't even know my mum.
Real world.
But no one cares.
You're on your own.
Hey, get used to it.
That it, then?
Is what it, then?
Want me to leave your place?
D'you wanna leave?
I don't know.
Whatever. I... I'll work it out anyway.
Aight, eat your breakfast.

Hello, Isaac James.
Congratulations.
Your single-occupancy Buena Vida flat
will be ready tomorrow.
Please provide proof of your ability
to pay a four-month deposit on arrival.
Thank you.
Anything else
we can help you with today, Isaac?
Double occup...
Can I inquire about... double occupancy?
Would you like to change
and apply for double occupancy?
Yes.
I didn't quite hear that.
Yes.
Would you like to change
and apply for double occupancy?
Yes!
No need to raise your voice.
Yes.
Great news.
In order to continue
with your double-occupancy application,
you will need to release
your single occupancy flat. Is that okay?
Isaac.
Is that okay?
You all right, Mum?
Sorry I haven't come
and seen you for a while.
I'm stayin' with Izi now.
He's been lookin' after me.
I'm sorry I couldn't say anything
at your funeral.
I love you, Mum.
Can I take my mum home?
I'm gonna
do a couple things while I'm here.
So I'll meet you at the front, yeah?
Yo.
Come on.
Izi?
- Know where they're gonna plant my mum?
- No.
Can you not... find out?
Benj, it's a fucking tree!
A tree.
Ain't got fuck all to do with your mum
anymore.
All right?
You ain't got money,
they fuckin' dump you.
Yeah? That's it.
Please, man.
Are you gonna go to Buena Vida?
I can't pay rent, but...
I don't even know
how rent works around there.
But I can cook... um...
clean, and I will never buy anything
without your permission...
Benji, stop.
Izi?
My... my mum...
she... she told me.
What she say?
She said you worked at Life After Life.
Lived in the Kitchen.
You never loved her,
but... you would've loved me.
- Izi?
- Hey.
Why you not eating?
Are you gonna eat?
Yeah.
- I was gonna do it.
- Hmm?
- Let's go and do something quickly though.
- Mm.
Yeah?
Isaac James, welcome to Buena Vida!
Come on!
Yes, come on, Kitchen.
- Take it easy though.
- Slow down. Hands out.
- Feel it.
- See you around, yeah?
Have a good time.
Nothing can stop us.
We are not like them.
They're not like us.

Where's their host like me?
Look at me.
Cheekbones. Gold tooth.
In your face, baby.
