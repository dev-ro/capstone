We let Alex shine a little

The bad news is my man won't

He's decided
to leave the nest.
Fly off on his own.

Look, there's a reason why you can get
a big house in the sticks for dirt cheap.
It's a wasteland.
The next she wants to stay.
She's all over the map.
Well, if you think it's such
a great idea, then why wait?
I knew it.
You don't wanna go.
You don't wanna go.
It'll be fine.
3 hours away?
I'm never gonna see you.
I just can't imagine
raising a baby in the city.
This house, it is like a
Malibu Barbie dream house.
I mean, this would be a project for me,
not some client.
And Alex is cool with it?
All these demos and even if
just a couple of them pay off,
then he can support me.
I'm very happy for you.
Thank you.
Oh, God.
[SIGHS]
You know what that
look was, right?
Yes, I do. Ahem.
But she'd be just as happy with a placeholder ring.
I don't wanna be that guy.
I'm not gonna get
her a piece of shit.
I thought maybe you were one of those people
who doesn't believe
in marriage.
Your parents were
married, right?
3 times each.
Aha.
Now we're getting someplace.
Oh, so sorry.
When you stare at us
while you're talking,
then we know you're
talking about us.
Oh, women have
amazing powers.
Uh, can I get you
a non-alcoholic beer?
No, we have to go
back to the office.
We have to finish
up some work.
Yeah, you guys are going
to Chippendale's
where some oily guys gonna
give her a lap dance.
I don't have a lap.
[LAUGHTER]
Bye.
May I?
May you what?
What are you--oh, God!
Oh, my God, my back!
I-it's all these things
I never thought about before.
I don't have a little sister,
I never even babysat,
and now I worry about
everything, like,
what if I drop him
on his head?
No, I'm being serious.
They come with skulls.
My mother's a disaster.
I mean, what
if that's genetic?
What if I inherit all
her maternal incompetence?
I don't think there's
a gene for that, Penny.
Penny?

Oh, my God.
Ha ha.
Oh, my God.
Yeah.
Oh, my God!
Yes.
Oh, my God!
God damn it, why don't

Listen, if you're
still with Alex,
tell him we are
at the hospital.
We can't a hold of him

Call me when
you get this.
[BREATHING DEEPLY]
Ok.
It's gonna be ok.

I missed it.
It happened really fast.
I can't believe
I missed it.
Come in, come on, here.
Hey.
Ahh.
Ok.

So tell me everything.
Honestly, I-I don't

[BEEP OF ANSWERING MACHINE]
PENNY:
Hey, I know you're working,
but I talked to
the realtor in Stanton.
I told him if he
cut his fee in half,
we could close
the deal right now.
He must be sick of my haggling
because he went for it.
I just think
we have to do it.
It's such a steal.
We'd be crazy
to pass this up.
And I really believe I can turn
it into something spectacular.
Anyway, I'll grab something from
carmine's on the way home.
We can start
hammering it out.
I just wanna make sure
you're ok with this.
If you're having any doubts
at all, just let me know.
Ok? I love you so much.
Well, it looks a little
dreary in the late months.
But you know,
in the spring with plants,
trees, I mean, it's gonna--
we could just paint it,
paint the brick.
Hmm.
It's from Michael.
"May this beautiful tree
represent your growing
love and blooming hopes,
and blah, blah, blah."
Does it really say,
"blah, blah, blah"?
Yeah. [LAUGHS]

Aah!

I'm sorry. You ok?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Get rid of that thing.
Well, now everything we cook's gonna taste like baby.

I'll--I'll help

You've gotta be kidding me.
This was--this

Can your guys get
this shit outta here?
I cannot put my piano

So what, just leave it
here on the ground?
[SIGHS]
What is all this crap?
Sorry.
How's little T?
He's good.
He's napping.
Can I give you a hand
with anything?
No, but maybe later you could
help me with the monitor?
Ok.
Poor girl.
Probably wondering what
she did to deserve this.
Hmm.
A lot of crap in here.
Shit!
No!
God damn it!
God damn it!
Are you on channel A

[BABY CRYING]
Channel B.
Should I put it
back on the shelf?!
You don't have to yell.
I can hear you
through the monitor.
Ok.
Yeah, put it
back on the shelf.
I think you have it
pointing at the ceiling.
You need to point it
down to the crib.
[STATIC]
Just move it a little
bit to the left.
[GASPS]
What's wrong?
Oh, God.
Where are you
taking my mom?
I'm sorry, babe.
But the effect with the

It's good.

I left a message
for you the other day.
All that peace and quiet

Johanna and I would
love to come down and,
uh, check the place out.
I'm sure you're ready
to get drunk
and admit
that you screwed up.
Because you know
you screwed up, right?
Big time.
What were you thinking?
[VOICES OVERLAPPING]
This is your life now.
Whole entire life is
nothing but that house.
You haven't written a demo,
not one verse, not one note
of music the whole time
you've been here.
You just stagger around like
a zombie, having nightmares
about a woman,
because she told you
she saw a woman
in the house.
She put it in your head
and now look at you.
Is that what you wanted?
Did you not see Tanner sitting here right in front of you?
Why did you leave him
at the top of the stairs?
Y-y-you're telling me
that y-y-you didn't
put him in the wagon and
set him right there?
Yes, I put him in the wagon,
but I had him in the nursery.
You just said you didn't
put him in there.
Ok. Y-you have got to manage this situation better,
all right?
I did not put him at
the top of the stairs, Alex!
I didn't. You're walking
around in a complete stupor!
Ok, I gotta get
outta here.
I'm gonna go
to the store.
[CRUNCHING]
Sweetie, put
some shoes on.
What's wrong?
Are you sure
you're ok to drive?
Uh...
I just drifted
off for a second.
You forgot the list.
I talked to Dr. Gordon.
He said try gripe water.
He may be having
gas at night.
Gripe water.
Are you sure you're
ok to leave?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Ok.
Don't be gone long.

So I would normally never ask a customer this,
but, um, are you ok?
I'm hangin' in there,
I suppose.
New baby?
5 months old.
Oh.
Doesn't sleep?
Now when he's supposed to.
He's got it all upside-down.
[SIGHS]
They got a term for it.
It's called
day/night confusion.
That'd be a really
good name for a band.
[BEEPING]
What?
You like babies?
Um, I wouldn't choose to
like, hang out with one,
but I know sometimes
it can't be helped.
Are you asking me if
I'll baby-sit for you?
Yeah.
Yeah. Yes.
Does your TV work?
You didn't answer my
question about the TV.
Ok, all right, look,
our cable doesn't work.
But our DVD player
works great.
Ok, ok.
Take it easy.
I mean, we just need
someone to--who will, uh,
to stay the night
with the baby.
That, I mean, that's it.
Ok.
I can trust you?
Like, I'm not gonna touch your liquor cabinet.
I had one too many
wine coolers once
when I was 14,
so I don't touch the stuff.
Smart girl.
So, um, I normally
would ask 10 an hour,
but since I'm gonna be
doing this overnight--
whatever you want.
I mean... Here.
Ok. [CHUCKLES]
Yeah, you just
gave me a hundred, so...
[CHUCKLES]
Hi.
So I have a baby brother
and a baby sister.
And my older sister
has a baby.
And my older brother
has a baby.
You wanna hear
about my cousins?
No, that's...
No, that's good.
Nice place.
So, um, if he sleeps,
then you can bring him
upstairs to his crib.
But what's been happening
since we moved in here
is he wakes up
every 15 minutes.
If that's the case, I would
just keep him down here.
You know you don't put him to sleep on his belly, right?
And if he---if he's sleepin'
and you get tired, you know,
you can just crash
out on the couch.
Or, um, coffee.
We have a coffee maker.
No, I don't do caffeine.
She doesn't drink
either.
And no red meat.
If that matters.
Well, that's
actually kind of cool.
But really, I don't want
you to worry about me.
Or the baby, of course.
[MUFFLED] So this is not gonna be a problem for me
[NORMAL VOICE] But you
know what I can't do?
So, uh,
y'all might want to be thinking about bed, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Electric chairs that carries you up and down the stairs.
What?
Nothing.
Never mind.
Electric chair.
I think she was
making a joke.
[SIGHS]
[SIGHS]
Thank you for this.
You were right.
I love hearing you
say I'm right.
Get some sleep.
You don't think there's something wrong with this place,
do you?
I think one
good night's sleep
and all this shit's
gonna go away.
Ok?
Yeah.
[BABY MURMURING]
[SQUEAK]
Hal?
We're doing good down here.
I think he's gonna
stay down for a while.
Um, do you wanna
put him in his crib?
Or should I do it?
Um, do you want me to...
You know what?
I'm gonna get him for you.

Stop what?!
Look. I know it's wrong.
I-I take full responsibility.

induced yourself

we moved in this place

left in your heart for me,
could you please, please stop
pounding on the window?

is... undermining your ability to play piano.

care of you and the baby.
You wanted this baby
just as much
as you wanted to
move into this house.
That's not true.
You think I'm an idiot?
You can't do this to me!
You can't treat me like this!
I said stay away from me.
I would never hurt you.
All I've ever done is given
you everything you wanted!

[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
WOMAN: It's been more than 6
weeks since a local woman
wandered away
from her hospital room
in Stanton only
to disappear.
The woman was being
treated for shock
following the death of
her 8-month-old daughter
who perished
when a fire broke out
at their home in Butler county.
Rescue efforts tapered off
after multiple searches
of the neighborhood
turned up nothing.
But the case is
getting a second look
after the disappearance of
another woman in the same town.
19-year-old Nancy Leggero
was reported missing
this week after failing to
show up at the supermarket
police in Butler county
are now wondering
in the disappearance
of the two women.
