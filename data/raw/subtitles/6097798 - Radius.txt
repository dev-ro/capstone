[PHONE RINGING]
- OPERATOR: 911, what is your emergency?
- I need help. There's a girl here.
She's in some kind of an accident
or something. I think she's dead.
OPERATOR: All right, sir, calm down.
Where are you right now?
I just passed a sign
that said Woodmore County.
I'm sorry, you're breaking up.
Can you repeat that again?
Ah, shit. It's Woodmore. I don't know
what the name of the road is.
Sir, calm down. Can I have your name please?
Yeah, it's...
Sir?

- [REPORTERS CLAMORING]
- MAN: Is the air safe to breathe?
- We have to wait for the coroner's report...
...before we can stipulate what it is
that actually happened here.
Now, whether the air
is safe to breathe or not...
- ...I can't say at this time.

WOMAN ON TV: I spoke with him earlier
and he confirms that the signs of death...
- ...were similar to Melanie Walker's...
- [CROW CAWING]
...the 29-year-old woman
who was found earlier this morning.
I also had an opportunity to talk
with Sheriff Laredo earlier on...
...concerning the current state of
affairs. This is what he had to say.
SHERIFF: We've established
only two occurrences so far.
One alongside route 131
going into Woodmore...
...and the other at Sophie's Diner,
just a few miles away.
So the good news for now is that
these incidents seem to be localized.
WOMAN: Now residents in and around this area
are considerably nervous about all this.
- Hey! Shut the hell up!
- [CROW CONTINUES CAWING]
...a gripping interview with the person
who first made this recent discovery...
...Sophie's Diner busboy, Dylan Keen,
who came in this morning late...
...which might have actually saved his life.

MAN ON RADIO:
The Woodmore string of mysterious deaths.
The latter also confirmed that the
coroner's office has officially ruled out...
...the possibility of an airborne virus...
...but is still uncertain as to
what is causing these deaths...
...and that the possibility of a contagion
has not yet been dismissed.
In related news, many local residents
have been voicing concerns...
...about these deaths being possibly
related to some form of terrorist activity.
[GROANS]
[CAR APPROACHING]
Oh, fuck.
FEMALE COP:
We've got a window pane back here.
The door's unlocked.
Mr. Hartwell, are you in there?
It's Woodmore Police. We found your truck.
- We are coming in.
- MALE COP: All right, I'll go inside.
- You check the surroundings.
- Gotcha.
Fuck.
I'm gonna take a look at the shed.
[EXHALES]
Uh, Tim, we've got a situation over here.
Dead birds, white eyes, like the shit
at Sophie's Diner type of thing.
TIM: All right, screw this.
I'll meet you back at the car.
[ENGINE STARTS]
Fuck. Fuck.
[CLATTERING]
- Oh, shit.
- WOMAN: Hello?
Is anybody in there?
- Stop!
- Who's in there?
- You've gotta get away from here!
- I just wanna talk to you.
No, don't come any closer. Please!
Is your name Liam?
Are you Liam Hartwell?
Look, we can talk, but just...
look, just get away from the shed.
- Why?
- Goddammit, just do what I say.
You need to get away from me. Now!
Please!
[KNOCKING AT DOOR]
I just wanna talk to you.
Liam?
Yeah?
Do you know who I am?
No. Who are you?
I was in your truck. We had an accident.
You were in the truck with me?
I didn't see you when I woke up.
Look, I'm sorry, but...
...you're gonna have to help me out here,
'cause I don't remember any of it.
The truck, the crash, you.
Nothing.
I don't believe this.
What?
I don't know who I am.
And I don't remember anything either.
Wait, what do you mean?
Jesus Christ.
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
What... how is that even possible?
Look, can we go inside?
I wanna take a look around.
Hey.
What's the matter?
Look, uh... what don't you
just go inside and I'll...
Is everything okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
How did you know to come here?
A cop told me the truck was
registered to a Liam Hartwell.
So here I am.
I didn't have anything on me.
So I just figured you were my best shot.
I mean, it was either that or stay
at the homeless shelter and let some...
...social worker figure it out.
WOMAN: Was that you?
Look, I don't think you live here. I mean...
...I didn't find any women's
clothes or anything.
What's with all the tape?
They said there was a virus or something.
- That's what they thought anyway.
- Yeah, I heard about that.
I mean, you know it's over, though, right?
They're saying it's not
in the air or anything.
I don't suppose you know your password.
Your guess is as good as mine.
[SNIFFING]
WOMAN: Hey, if you thought it wasn't safe
outside, then why were you out there?
Are you okay?
Do you know some place
called Smithburg or Oakdale?
Here. County line.
It's right next to a bridge.
And we were both there.
What is it?
Nothing. Let's get out of here.
Sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to figure us out, that's all.
So, what do I call you?
Everybody's been calling me Jane Doe.
I guess it's something I've gotten used to.
Jane.
All right, then.
I don't remember this place at all.
We were here.
Dammit.
You know, when you asked me
before if I knew you?
I didn't. I still don't.
- Just...
- What?
I just have this feeling like...
...I feel like I know you.
Yeah?
When I was at the hospital, I had this dream.
I mean, I'm not even sure
if this is a real memory or not.
But in the dream, I'm...
...I'm a kid, I'm like seven or eight...
...and I'm at the mall with my family.
Faces I can't even make out.
We're all just waiting
in line to see Santa Claus.
And there's this kid who's up
on Santa's lap and...
...he reaches up...
...and he pulls the guy's beard down.
And I see this and I just...
...I just lose it.
I just ran, I just ran all the way up
into the parking lot.
I guess I couldn't take it.
It's the only thing I remember
from my whole life.
Pretty useless, huh?
No. I disagree.
If anything, it proves
that everything is still in there.
It's not lost.
You just have to find
a better way to get at it.
It's too late for that.
You can't stay here.
Jane?
I'm fine, I just... I just
remembered something. I...
...I threw something into the water.
It was like, um...
...it was papers, or...
- ...I feel like it's...
- Hey, take your time.
You were there.
I feel like I was leaving something behind.
God, this is so frustrating.
- Why were we here?
- I don't know.
Look. The cops didn't find anything
in that pickup truck, right?
What about the crash site itself?
ON RADIO: In a press briefing held earlier
today by the State Medical Examiner's Office.
We are currently referring to these deaths
as attacks on the human body...
...carried out by forces outside of nature...
...meaning that whatever the cause,
they are, in all likelihood, man-made.
In light of this new information,
Woodmore law enforcement has announced...
...they will now be cooperating
with state officials...
Did the cops manage
to figure out why we crashed?
They didn't say. And I heard there was
another car that went off the road?
One of those people that died from
the virus or whatever they're calling it.
But I don't think that
had anything to do with us.
Let's go down and have a look.
What the hell happened here?
I don't think a fire did this.
[THUNDERCLAP]
[GASPS]
What is it?
- Where were you?
- What?
When you woke up, where were you?
I... I was over here. I mean...
...here.
I think I was over here.
I mean, it was so goddamn dark, but...
Yeah, I think it was somewhere around here.
Why?
Liam?
Look, we've gotta talk.
When I got out of here,
something was going on with me.
I didn't know about it at first.
I mean, I...
...I thought it was in the air,
or I don't know, a virus or something.
I mean, the birds were falling
out of the goddamn sky, for fuck's sakes.
What are you talking about?
All right, uh...
...the girl, the one in the car,
the one that died.
Yeah.
That was me.
- What?
- I didn't know about it. I...
...I mean, I didn't do it on purpose.
I didn't even know why I was doing it.
Doing what?
Killing them.
It was like I was just sucking the life
right out of them just by coming close.
Look, I know it sounds insane,
but it happened, all right?
It happened. I mean, people
would just walk up to me and...
...they'd just drop, they'd fucking drop.
Jane, that's why you found me
hiding out all the way back to my shed.
I was just trying
to keep away from everybody.
- This is crazy.
- Jane, listen to me!
That was me. I killed those people.
But, look... look, whatever it was,
whatever I had inside of me is gone now.
- How can you be sure about that?
- No, please trust me. I know I'm fine.
Why are you telling me this now?
Because look at where you're standing.
Whatever happened here,
it happened to both of us.
Yeah, I know that. I said
that I was standing here, but...
...it was so goddamn dark, I could've been
all the way over there for all I know.
So you didn't notice
anything different about yourself?
- No.
- I mean, nothing even...
...I mean, remotely weird happen to you
since you crawled out of this place?
No, and I certainly didn't kill anybody.
LIAM: Jane, wait!
Jane! Jane, stop! Goddammit, I'm sorry!
Oh, you're sorry?
How do I even know it's safe
to be around you right now?
- What if that thing comes back on?
- It won't.
And what if it does?
And what if you end up killing me?
Have you thought about that?
JANE: You should have told me before, Liam.
Hold on a minute, honey, okay?
- Hey there, you guys all right?
- Yeah, we're fine, just leave us alone.
- Ma'am, are you all right?
- I can't do this.
- Jane!
- WOMAN: Sir?
What do you want?
- Look, we're just...
- Hold on there. Are you Liam Hartwell?
Yeah.
We've been looking for you.
On account of your truck
has been found right down...
JANE: Liam?
What's going on?
- Oh, my God!
- No, no, no! Jane! Jane, wait! Jane!
Jane! Stop! Just stop! Stop!
- Let me go! Don't touch me.
- Just stop!
Look, you're not gonna die.
Okay? I promise you. You're not gonna die.
What the hell just happened?
We've gotta get the hell out of here. Please!
Please.
Trust me.
GIRL ON PHONE: Mom?
Mom, are you there? Mom?
JANE: What are we doing here?
Walk that way.
- What?
- Jane, just walk that way.
Please.
[GOAT BLEATING]
Stop!
- If you don't tell me what we're doing...
- Now back away.
Jesus.
- What the hell just happened?
- You moved.
- Are you saying I did this?
- No, I did.
I've been doing it all along
and you've been stopping it...
...without even knowing.
Oh, my God.
- We've gotta get to a hospital.
- What, are you crazy?
There's gotta be some tests they can do.
Blood analysis, some kind
of brain scan, something.
I've been to the hospital.
They scanned me because of the accident
and nothing weird popped up.
Well, you weren't the one killing people,
were you? We have to do this.
You wanna what? You wanna walk
into a hospital and tell them what?
- Jane... we need to do this.
- That you're radiating death?
You saw how I reacted when you told me.
Why don't you just imagine that...
...on a much larger scale?
We have to be smart about this.
If we go to a hospital a couple
of counties down from here...
...somewhere where the police
aren't actually looking for me.
Look, I know it sounds risky, but I need
to figure out what this thing is.
Once we do that, hopefully,
we can make the police understand.
Look, we can tell a doctor that you've
been having trouble remembering...
...because of the accident.
I mean, that much is true.
They'll give you a CT scan.
That's at least what they did for me.
I'm sorry. I should've told you.
We're in this together now.
How many days ago was this accident?
Three nights ago.
You really should have come
to the hospital right away.
[GASPS]
Mr. Hartwell? Is everything okay?
Yes, sorry. [CLEARS THROAT]
DOCTOR: Right, let's get you up
to that scan right away.
Come with me.
Okay, everything's all set to go.
So, ma'am, if you could just step outside.
- No, no, she's gotta stay in here with me.
- The scan is only gonna take a few minutes.
- I can't be in here alone.
- Yeah, he gets claustrophobic sometimes.
Okay, well, we have some medication
we can give you for that.
- No, you don't understand. Please.
- You can't have anybody else in the room.
Can I just go in the booth with you? I mean,
at the very least, he'll be able to see me.
Please.
WOMAN: Okay, we're all set to go here,
so just remember to stay still...
...and we will be done in no time at all.
All right, here we go.
[MACHINE HUMMING]
So you didn't see anything
weird on that monitor?
I don't know, I mean,
I wouldn't even know what to look for.
What about the girl, how did she react?
Did it seem like
she might have seen anything?
I don't think so.
What's taking them so goddamn long?
WOMAN ON TV: A new lead today in the
mysterious death of a Woodmore County officer.
The officer's son confirms hearing his mother
speak the name Liam Hartwell...
...only moments before her death...
...which led police to Hartwell's home
where they made a shocking discovery...
...just behind me here in a field opposite
the home. One more dead body...
...showing signs of death identical
to those found earlier this week.
State law enforcement has officially
declared Hartwell armed and dangerous.
- And they are asking anyone that...
- Shit! We have to get out of here.
- Fuck!
- Wait, wait, no.
Maybe we can just explain it to them. We're
here, aren't we? We were getting tests done.
Tests? Liam, you killed one of their own.
These people don't wanna talk to you.
They wanna bring you in.
Liam, they will separate us.
Mr. Hartwell? I was just on my way
to see you. Is everything all right?
LIAM: What does it say?
- Pardon?
- The scan, what did it say?
- DOCTOR: We're not doing this here.
- We don't have time for this.
You can either come with me to consultation
or you can just schedule another appointment.
- What the hell?
- Tell me what the scan says.
- Liam, they're coming.
- Tell me.
Nothing.
What do you mean nothing?
You must have read it wrong.
- Let's go.
- You're fine.
- There's nothing the matter with you.
- Liam, come on.
WOMAN: Hey! Hey! Police!
Okay, you take that one, I'll go this way.
JANE: I think we lost them.
The elevator, it's over here.
Jane!
- Jane!
- Liam!
- Jane! No!
- Liam!
MAN: Are you okay, buddy?
Everybody just get out of here,
okay? All of you.
- What's the matter?
- All of you! Get out!
When those doors open, run.
Do you understand me?
Run! Get out of here!
No! Go! Go! Get out! Go! Move!
No! Shit!
Fuck.
What? Fuck!
Come on, come on, come on.
No.
Come on!
Come on. Come on.
Liam!
- Oh, my God! Are you all right?
- I'm fine. Everybody's fine.
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have stopped.
- Let's get out of here.
Hey. Hey, stop.
No, this way, come on.
LIAM: Come on.
This place looks good.
Are you all right?
I was missing.
I still am.
What I've learned about
my life so far, it just doesn't...
...it doesn't seem right.
I have this feeling like I shouldn't go back.
Look, we're both pretty tired.
I think the best thing we can do is to...
...get some rest and then look at this
thing with fresh eyes tomorrow, alright?
WOMAN ON RADIO: All across
the board, sunny skies and clear...
[MAN SPEAKING OVER RADIO]
[MUSIC PLAYING OVER RADIO]
REPORTER:
...in relation to the Woodmore incidents.
Smithburg County police chief also revealed
that Hartwell was accompanied...
...by a local woman
by the name of Rose Daerwood.
The woman had immediately
been identified by her husband...
...local store owner, Sam Daerwood after the
latter had seen security camera footage...
...broadcast on Channel 4 News earlier today.
Daerwood, who was also present at
the press conference, had this to say.
SAM: I don't care what
you've gotten yourself into.
Whatever it is, we can work it out.
Please, Rose, just come home. I love you.
REPORTER: Police are asking for anyone
with information on the whereabouts...
...of both Rose Daerwood and Liam Hartwell
to contact their local authorities...
...and warn that Hartwell is still
considered armed and dangerous.
LIAM: So, what do you wanna do?
Maybe...
...maybe it's worth a shot meeting him.
I mean, what if...
...what if meeting him makes me remember?
If I could just remember what
happened the night we crashed...
...maybe we could use that to get help...
...to get rid of this thing.
That's...
...it's a lot of ifs.
No, you should do it.
You should go.
What do you mean, I should go?
I'm staying here.
- What?
- It's too dangerous out there.
- I'm a ticking time bomb.
- Liam...
Do you know how many people
could've died back there?
Yeah, but they didn't.
It was luck. That's all.
I don't believe this.
You think it's gonna be safer here?
How long before you think somebody
comes snooping around?
- I'll wait in the woods until you come back.
- Jesus Christ, I'm not going alone!
What if this guy isn't even who he says he is?
What if he's the reason I went missing?
I could be running away
from him for all we know.
Liam?
I need you.
All right, there are three of them in
Smithburg, but look at this one at the bottom.
Daerwood Press.
See, I think I remember them saying
something on the radio that he had a store.
- All right. Let's get the hell out of here.
- [CAR STARTS]
Sam Daerwood?
Rose? Oh, my God!
Where have you been? Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Just get in the car.
- What?
Please, I can't get into this
right now. Just get in the car.
Holy shit.
- Rose, tell me everything's all right.
- I'm fine. Just get in the car.
- Fuck this. Rose, get out...
- Sam! Do you trust me?
- Rose, what are...
- If you trust me, you will get in the car.
What the hell is going on?
Where are we going?
We need your help.
- This is insane.
- Sam.
SAM: And you honestly expect me
to believe all of this?
Clearly this guy is a terrorist or a goddamn
psycho and he's got you brainwashed.
- You're not listening to me.
- Rose, I don't believe for a second...
...that you don't remember who I am.
I don't.
No. No way.
And this crazy bullshit, I mean,
who the fuck are you anyway?
- What are you doing?
- I am ending this now.
- Sam, please give me the phone.
- I am calling the police and we are leaving.
I can't do that.
So if you won't help us,
I am gonna have to go.
- Rose...
- LIAM: Hey!
- Step back.
- What?
Just do it.
- Holy shit.
- Stop. Stop. It's okay.
Sam.
Can we trust you?
You guys can hide out back here.
SAM: It's not much, but it's out of the way.
I can keep the shop closed
for a couple of days, but...
...after that, I mean...
what's the plan here?
I... I mean, we're still trying to figure
that out. We have to get in touch...
...with, like, a researcher or scientist.
- So we'll need your help.
- Okay.
And maybe have you act
as, like, a middle man.
But I don't... I don't know.
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.
We should wait until everything
in the media dies down.
- JANE: Oh, he's right.
- Right.
First things first, we gotta
get rid of that car out there.
A buddy of mine owns a scrap yard.
I can take it there.
Are you sure?
He's a friend of ours.
We've known him for years.
All right.
I'll be right back.
He seems like a good guy.
WOMAN ON TV: ...as to why an upstanding
Smithburg citizen like Daerwood...
...would seemingly go along
for the ride with Hartwell...
...a man who is considered
both armed and dangerous.
To make matters worse,
an eye witness at the hospital...
...reports seeing Hartwell and Daerwood
in each other's arms at one point...
...which begs the question, is Rose
Daerwood in some sort of relationship...
...with this man, and if so,
to what degree is she helping him?
- Can she be considered an accomplice?
- Jesus!
[TV TURNS OFF]
JANE: I wonder what's taking him so long.
What is it?
- It's you.
- What the hell?
Lily Grayson?
It says you've been missing for over a year.
SAM: Rose? What's going on?
SAM: Even though you were the same age,
you always called her your big sister.
What happened to her?
Look, can we do this in private?
It's all right.
I'll wait here.
SAM: The police said she left work
one night and just...
...never came home.
She's still missing.
Look, let's not do this now,
not with everything that's going on.
- Why not?
- Later.
Sam, anything can help, please.
Look, after the police
didn't find any leads...
...you took it pretty hard.
You started putting posters up
all over town, started missing work.
You got really depressed.
It was a rough patch on us.
We fought all the time.
- And last week was just hell.
- What do you mean?
It had been one year
since Lily disappeared and...
...you showed up here and started
making photocopies for a poster.
It was like it was starting all over again.
We had this huge fight and you stormed off.
I didn't make a big deal of it at first because
we've had this kind of fight before and...
...you always come back after a few days.
You usually stay in a motel or something.
At least that's what you tell me.
[SNIFFLING]
You know there's better ways to die.
Shit. Just...
- ...just fucking get out of here.
- What's your name?
Just go!
If that's what you want.
Better make sure you dive in
head first, though...
...because from this height...
...best case scenario,
you'll probably break your neck...
...and the rest of your life in a wheelchair.
I just miss her so much.
LIAM: Come on.
Can I drive you home?
No.
It's too late for that.
You don't have to explain yourself to me.
Look, we can go anywhere you want.
You can't stay here.
Just drive.
My name is Liam.
I'm Rose.
- Rose?
- Yes, I'm okay.
- What is it?
- It's nothing.
- You can talk to me.
- I... I'm okay.
You wouldn't happen to have
any food around here, would you?
Uh, no.
But maybe I can swing by the house
and pick up some stuff.
That... that would be great. Thank you.
REPORTER: Authorities speculate
that Hartwell and Daerwood...
...may be taking refuge
somewhere in the tri-county area.
Where's Sam?
What's the matter?
That night at the bridge, you and me,
we didn't know each other, not before that.
You don't understand.
You saved my life.
Jane? Jane, get up.
JANE: Hey. You're back.
Yeah.
Brought you some things.
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.
SAM: I brought some sleeping bags.
They're by the door.
Rose, who the hell is this guy?
I mean, who is he, really?
How long have you known him?
How did you two even meet?
It's complicated.
Fuck! Christ!
Rose, what the hell has happened to you?
Why can't you talk to me?
I don't know you, Sam.
I'm sorry.
WOMAN ON TV: Don't make this
any more sensationalistic than it is.
MAN ON TV: No, no, no, why don't you just
admit that this Hartwell guy is a terrorist?
I mean, these are your words here.
Instantaneous death of the brain, most
likely caused by a rapid randomization...
...of the current among the victims synapses.
So basically, this guy's got a weapon
that fries people's brains...
I have a place up north.
No neighbors, no cars, none of that.
I like to go up there once
in a while and clear my head.
Think.
Sometimes I get out on the water.
We can just let go.
Sounds nice.
MAN ON TV: Is he using a gun, is it a bomb,
is he using some kind of chemical spray?
- WOMAN: We don't know that yet.
- MAN: Well, that is so typical.
WOMAN: We've got people working
on this very question as we speak.
Do you have any maps around here?
Up front.
What are you looking for?
I'm not sure.
What's that?
It doesn't concern you.
By the way...
...stop calling her Jane.
There's nobody around.
I mean, it's the perfect place.
- We'll be safe there.
- You can't be sure of that.
- I'm sure it is.
- Because you saw it in a goddamn dream?
Look, we need to get as far away
from people as we can.
- That's just a fact.
- The shop is closed.
- No one's gonna come around.
- LIAM: How long is that gonna work?
How long do you think it's gonna be before
some cop comes around here looking for her?
Because they're looking for her
just as much as they're looking for me.
It's too risky staying here.
All right, I'll drive you up there tonight.
We'll hold up for a few days and after that...
- No.
- What?
We go alone.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Who the hell do you think you are? No!
- Sam.
- No!
- We need you here.
- Why?
We need you to be the voice of reason here,
the link between us and them.
- This is bullshit.
- How do you think it's gonna look...
...if you disappear with us
right in the middle of all this?
I can't believe this.
Shit.
Let him go. He needs to blow off some steam.
[DOOR OPENS]
I didn't get a chance to finish it.
No, that's great. I'm sure it's gonna help.
It says here I don't like pizza.
You don't.
How can I not like pizza?
Everybody likes pizza.
You don't like the texture.
You say it's chewy.
You said it, not me.
All right. I guess I'm just gonna
have to take your word for it.
- You have to go, now.
- What?
Just get your things.
Take that, I'll go get the car.
- What're you talking about? It's broad daylight.
- I don't have time to explain, all right?
You're just gonna have to trust me.
We have to go now.
- Why?
- Please.
You called the cops. Fuck!
- I told them you needed help.
- Oh, my God!
- I said not to separate you.
- We've gotta get out of here, now!
- Rose, I explained everything.
- It's not gonna matter.
- LIAM: Where's your car?
- Everything is gonna be all right.
- Where's your car?
- [KNOCKING AT DOOR]
- COP: Smithburg Police, open up!
- Shit.
- Liam, what are we gonna do?
- I don't know. I don't know.
COP: Mr. Daerwood,
you're gonna have to open this door!
- Just let me talk to them.
- Give me your keys. Come on.
Come here.
- Mr. Daerwood?
- Yeah.
Are they still inside?
Hartwell and your wife,
are they still inside?
Yes, they're still inside.
- Wait, wait a minute!
- Sir, it's for your own safety.
SAM: No! Let go of me, goddammit! Jesus Christ!
You said we were gonna do this together.
COP: Just get in the vehicle, Mr. Daerwood.
We'll take it from here.
You've gotta take them in together. Hey!
[SAM YELLING]
- Oh, shit!
- On the ground!
- Okay! Okay!
- Get down.
Drop, hands behind your back.
- COP 1: He's clean.
- COP 2: Same here.
All right, get them up. Ma'am, we're gonna
need to ask you a few questions now.
- Take him out front.
- No, no, no, please. You can't do that.
- Get them out of here.
- JANE: No!
- You can't take me out there, not without her.
- I have to go. We have to go together.
- Ma'am, you need to calm down.
- JANE: No, just let me go!
Listen to me. Please! Please!
Look, I'll go with you.
I'll go with you, all right?
You've gotta keep us together, okay? Please.
- Just let me go!
- COP: Calm down.
Stop dragging me out there,
or people are gonna die.
- He's gonna kill everybody!
- We're all gonna die!
No! No! You gotta get out of here! Go!
Go! Do you hear me? You're gonna die!
- Let me go with him!
- All right, that's enough. Take her out back.
- Get out of here! Please! No!
- You're all gonna die!
No! No!
No! No!
[SOBBING] No! No! No!
Fuck! Fuck!
No.
- Please.
- Sarge?
- No!
- Get on the ground.
- Don't.
- Get on the ground!
Get on the...
Fuck.
Jane? Jane?
Jane?
Oh, my God! Liam!
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
- I'm so sorry.
- Just get the keys.
Are they...
They're dead. All of them.
Look, we've gotta get out of here
before more of them show up.
My car is two streets away,
in front of a gray house.
- I'm not gonna say anything.
- We've gotta get out of here, now.
Come with us.
No. Somebody's gotta stay here and explain
to them how this thing really works.
I have to make them understand
that none of this was your fault.
- Both of you.
- [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE]
- Just go.
- Thank you.
Let's go.
It's not your fault.
There's only so many times
I can tell myself that.
MAN ON TV: NASA just released images
of what they're currently qualifying...
- Liam.
- ...an unexplained cosmic event.
The image lasts only for a few frames,
but we can definitely make out something...
...that seems to literally touch down
somewhere on the East Coast...
...knocking out a communication
satellite in the process.
NASA spokesperson is set to address the issue
tomorrow morning in a press conference...
...in Washington DC,
and we're all very excited...
That's what happened, that's what did
this to us. I mean, it has to be, right?
We have to call Sam. He has to get
in touch with NASA or somebody.
- No, we can't do that.
- Why?
Because they're gonna be tapping his phone
after what happened at the store.
- Shit.
- Look, chances are...
...Sam's already seen, or at the very
least, he's gonna see it tomorrow.
He'll figure it out.
This is the place?
Yeah.
What if it doesn't work?
I mean, suppose Sam finds
somebody to explain this to.
Someone who will actually listen to him
or get it through their heads...
...that none of this is our fault.
It's all because of this...
...whatever the fuck it is.
That doesn't guarantee that anybody's
gonna be able to figure out how to cure us.
Why are you saying this?
If they can't find the cure,
they can't cure me.
And they're gonna have
to lock us up together.
Until...
...who the fuck knows.
You don't deserve that.
Liam?
I wouldn't care.
I'm gonna take a walk around.
[OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING]
Fuck.
It must be hard losing a sister.
What is it?
Nothing.
I just don't remember saying I had a sister.
I didn't wanna say anything earlier.
I recognized you from those posters.
You guys were identical twins, right?
It wasn't much of a guess.
Do you think maybe we could...
...stop for coffee somewhere?
[SCREAMING]
[PANTING]
[SOBBING]
[GRUNTING]
[SCREAMING]
No!
Hey!
You're never gonna find her!
Oh, you think you're gonna stop me?
[GRUNTING]
[BARFING]
Is it true?
No!
You sick piece of shit.
I didn't know. I didn't know.
Get on your fucking knees! Get on your knees!
[GUN COCKS]
- Jane.
- You don't fucking call me that.
Not anymore.
Fuck!
[SOBBING]
Where is she?
Where the fuck is she?
[YELLING] Where the fuck is she?
Get up! Get the fuck up.
Go get her!
Go on. Get her!
What are you doing?
Keep going.
Keep going.
- [GUN FIRES]
- [JANE SCREAMS]
- [GUN CLICKS]
- MAN: Easy now.
- Is this the guy from the gas station?
- Yep.
- Give me that.
- Listen, you guys don't wanna do this.
- Listen...
- Shut the fuck up!
- Terrorist piece of shit.
- [LIAM GRUNTING]
Ted, come and kick this guy's ass.
Come on.
Come on, pussy!
Just kick him in the goddamn ribs.
TED: Stand him up. I wanna punch him instead.
MAN: Oh, Jesus Christ.
All right, stand up straight,
you piece of shit.
Take care of her!
[GUN FIRES]
MAN: That's it. Now come on back.
Liam.
- Stop!
- MAN: You better listen to her.
Look, if you guys just...
just leave us alone...
...you're gonna have a chance
to get out of here alive.
Oh, fuck this.
Let's just kill the guy already.
TED: Whoa, hey, you never
said anything about that.
MAN: Shut the hell up, pussy!
Last chance, buddy.
Dad? Dad!
- Stop!
- No!
No, no, no! Let me see.
- No!
- Let me see you! Please.
- Get off me!
- Let me see. Come on.
[GROANS]
Hang on, hang on, hang on. Oh, Jesus!
All right, let's go, come on.
Sit up, sit up. Up, up, up.
[SCREAMING IN PAIN]
Come on. Come on, come here.
Hang on.
[WHIMPERS]
- Help! Hey! Hey. She needs help.
- NURSE: What happened to her?
- She was shot.
- Put her right here.
DOCTOR: What have we got?
NURSE: Female, early 30s,
gunshot wound to the abdomen.
DOCTOR: There's a lot of blood.
Entry point's in the back.
NURSE: Her heart is racing and her
neck veins are distended. She's pale.
DOCTOR: Airway's intact,
but she's in shock. Let's go.
JANE: Liam.
Where is he?
Wait.
Liam.
