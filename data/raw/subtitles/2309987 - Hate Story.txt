But in the future the chances

Okay. So you hae

The story that you wrote,
the way you took the pictures..
..you need talent for that.
And you hae it.

l hae my selfish
reasons behind this offer.
You are honest, dynamic, creatie.
My company needs you.
Kaya, there are ery
few people in the world..
..who do the work that they

So how will that happen?
You don't trust me?
l trust your confidence completely.
- Thanks.
There is a difference
of 240 crores between..
..your quotation and
Uniersal Cement's quotation.
And you are still
telling me they are robbing us.
The logic is ery simple, Mr. Jai.
Uniersal Cement is
only one year old company.
Their promoters are the
stakeholders of RGV Cements..
..a bankrupt cement company.
After being blacklisted from
the international market..
..RGV Cements has shut down.
And the cement that you were
getting at 25% less price..
..actually nobody will buy it
from the market een for free.
Here is the proof.
RGV Cements is a sold,
bankrupt company.
Here please.
Look, Mr. Jai.
lf you negotiate a bit
more with Uniersal Cement..
..they might further
reduce the price by 25%.
You know, maybe een 50%.
Ms. Kaya.
- Yes, sir.
And Mr. Dhanrajgir.
We will get back to you.
Yes, Mr. Jai.
Surely.
Thank you, sir.
Sir, yeah.
Kaya, the contract.. we got it.
Really?
l am so sorry.
Well done, Kaya.
Very well done.
Get ready quickly.
Where?
- l am taking you out.
For dinner. Fie minutes. Okay?
See you.
Wow!
Cheers.
- Cheers.
Sorry.
Let's dance.

Sid.
Your PA was saying

..terminated my security card.
What's going on?
The best thing about bad news is..
..that the person about whom
the news is, finds out last.
The way l found out.
About my company's scandal.
After reading your newspaper.
Sid.
lt's a.. it's a joke, right?
lt's not a joke. But l

Come.

Do you know why l

So that l can remind myself
that l hae the easiest way..
..of taking reenge in front of me.
Shoot and end of the matter.
Right? lt's simple.
What can l gie you that is
worst and more terrifying than death?
So this is my inspiration.
lf you want to ruin someone's life..
..it is important to keep him alie.
Death saes you from deastation.

You rejected me.

Liing without you

Kaya.
Kaya.
Kaya, stop.
Kaya, come back.

reason to remember you.
You are ery proud of
your wealth, aren't you?
What if l snatch half of it?
Really?
You can't pluck a
strand of hair from my head.
Forget half my wealth.
Siddharth Dhanrajgir.
Just a strand of hair is

Hello.

How dare you call me?
Please listen to me for a minute.
We were forced to meet in

Siddharth Dhanrajgir.

What?
- To take reenge from him..
..l hae used you, Raj.
l copied all the
emails from your phone.

information to Deshraj Tandon..
..to stop Cementec's deal.
Raj.
Stop, Raj. Stop. Stop. Wait.
Listen to me. Listen to me. Please.

Listen to me. Listen to me.
Had that been the case, why

..l neer felt like

l am sorry. Today, before

Feelings. - ..it was
important to tell you the truth.
Feelings. Stop.

Raj.

Yes.

Mr. Siddharth, the
lie telecast has begun.
Yes. Yeah.
Rajde, you scoundrel.
** rat.
Siddharth, een cricket
telecast is delayed by six seconds.
This is lie. Fresh and hot.
Mr. Siddharth, my work is oer.
Now you see what you
want to do with this idiot.
Don't do anything, Major.
Don't do anything right now.
His mid-life crisis
can sole our problem.
Let her continue haing
an affair with this idiot.
Using this scoundrel
we will ruin her slowly.
Right.
And entire Delhi knows.
Nobody can defeat me when it's
the matter of heart and business.
Yeah.
- Nobody.
Thank you, Major. You may leae now.
Goodnight, sir.
Papa.. our final
figure for the tender of..
..Biodiersity Park dam
project is 3900 crores.
We hae the copy of
Delhi Cements' tender.
They.. are quoting 4000 crores.
Are you sure of the figures, Sid?
- Yeah. Yeah.
lt's confirmed information. Yeah.
The rate is good.
This is our..
..big comeback, papa.
Nowadays you are
busy in which project?
l don't like it anywhere without you.
Een in office.
You don't loe me.
With your lips and hands, yes.
But..
..not from your heart.
ls being loyal to Siddharth
Dhanrajgir dearer to you..
..than your loe for me?
What is Cementec's
new project? Tell me.
lf you loe me..
..why don't you tell
me about Cementec?
Why? What is their new project?
What is their new deal? Tell me.
Tell me.
A dam is being built
at Biodiersity Park.
lt's a big project.
Your boss is a bad businessman, Raj.
As long as l am there,
he won't get any tender..
..leae alone this tender.
Because the information that l
hae gien to Delhi Cements..
..een Siddharth Dhanrajgir's
messiahs can't get hold of it.
The major expenditure of the dam
that is being built is of stones.
Stones costing 1500
crores are going to be used.
lt's aailable at the park for free.
The minister will take 200 crores.
A profit of 1800 crores.
Now guess, what is
Delhi Cements' new bid?
Ask her, what is Delhi Cements' bid?
Ask her. Come on,
you scoundrel. Ask her.
What is Delhi Cements' bid?
3500 crores.
Yes!
Papa..
..now our bid is 3200 crores.
Een if we gie the
minister 400 crores..
..we will earn a profit of 800 crores.
Are you sure?
Absolutely, papa.
Look, if you find a
single eidence against me..
..l promise you that l
will leae politics..
..and become a social worker.
Fine? Jai Hind.
Mr. Kumar.
How are you?
- lt's your grace, Mr. Malhotra.
Hae a seat.
Tell me.
Mr. Malhotra..
..a dam is being built
at Biodiersity Park.
Your cut is 400 crores.
Look, Mr. Kumar.
Whether you build a dam
there or somebody else.
l am only concerned about deelopment.
Mr. Mishra, tell me. Where
do l hae to sign? - Sir.
Sign here.
You hae checked, haen't you?
Mr. Malhotra, one moment.
- Yes.
lt's 400 crores because the
stones that will be used..
..for the construction of the dam
is already aailable at the park.
l understand.
l will call you.
Mr. Mishra will tell you
how to transfer the funds.
Fine, Mr. Malhotra.
You will get the money.
Always a pleasure
meeting you, Mr. Kumar.
Thank you.
Yes, Mr. Mishra. Let's finish this.
Thank you, sir.
Papa thought 400 crores is too much.
But l thought it's quite less.
ln business and politics conduct..
..is more important than money.
This contract is not
about only profit.
lt's the question of my honor.
lt's a challenge for me.
And l can't tolerate failure at all.
Please keep that in mind.
Yes, tell me.
- Papa, we hae got the contract.
l just.. l just signed the papers.
- Okay.
Siddharth Dhanrajgir.
You had planted these
cameras in my house, right?
To follow me round the clock.
l ** those who ** with me.
l hae learnt it from you.
You lost the 400 crores
that you gae to the minister.
And 1600 crores as well.
Because in Biodiersity Park you
won't find stone worth een Re.1.
Because l hae already diulged
this secret to your competitors.
Now what will you tell your papa?
Papa.. l hae..
** up.
** bitch.
**
-
Sir, you hae matchstick?
Sorry. l don't smoke.
Let's go.
Papa.
Translators : Milad Taherkhani & Mohammad Taherkhani
WwW.TeH-MoviE.IN
Yes?
Kaya Krishna.
Yes.
l hae an arrest warrant for you.
What's my crime?
Murdering Rajde.
How?
- How?
Only you can say that
at the police station.
Shall we go?
Shall l come like this? Or..
..shall l wear something?
No. lt will be better if
you wear some clothes.
ln the murder case of
Cementec lnfra's CEO Rajde..
..Delhi's famous socialist
Kaya Krishna is going to be..
..presented today at
Delhi's Patiala House court.
There is a tense atmosphere here.
Whether Rajde Singh
committed suicide..
..or he was murdered, that's a
different contention, My Lord.
But it's clear that my client
Kaya Krishna is being framed.
Because she is the same
Kaya Krishna who had exposed..
..Cementec lnfra and Justice L.K.
Shukla's bribery case.
At that time the CEO had to resign.
And the present CEO
was murdered, My Lord.
That's all, Your Honor.
Come, sir.
l admit Mr. Rajde
Singh committed suicide.
But he didn't commit
suicide willingly.
And to proe that l want the
permission to present this..
..suicide note written by Mr.
Rajde Singh and this DVD.
Permission granted.
l made a grae mistake that
l got influenced by Kaya..
..and l ruined my
personal and professional life.
Now Kaya has
started blackmailing me.
And she is forcing me to marry her.
Under these circumstances l
can't come in front of you.
That's why l am committing suicide.
And that's why l am
sending this recording.
Gorgeous. Gorgeous.
l loe you, Kaya.
On the basis of this
letter and the eidences..
..and the police inestigation,
the court orders Kaya Krishna..
..to be put behind bars for
a judicial remand of 14 days.
The court is adjourned.
Why did you hire such a CEO?
Papa.. what did l know what
he does in his personal life?
Find out, Sid. lt's
important to find out.
You are running a
business of 10000 crores.
Other's personal life can
finish off your professional life.
Understand?
And yes, this girl Kaya Krishna.
She is the same girl who had done..
..a sting operation on
Cementec lnfra, isn't she?
l don't know.
Maybe. l don't know.
Sid, whateer is going on..
..a strange contract..
..wrong information,
Rajde's suicide..
..Kaya Krishna's arrest..
..are you doing something
that you shouldn't be doing?
No, papa.
Your stammering..
..has worsened.
An ex-journalist in a sex scandal.
These are not rumors.
These are eidences.
Now, entire Delhi is calling
you number one.. prostitute.
Say something in your defense.
Seeral men will come to help you.
My only problem is..
..is l can't decide..
..whether to lie or not.
Because if l speak the truth,
then those people..
..for whom you are toiling so hard..
..all of them will be in prison.
What nonsense are you talking!
That's why nonsense is being recorded.
l want to tell you
something off the record.
Will you listen?
The business of politics
and the politics of business.
Both are strange.
When the table turns, you neer know.
She can't come here.
And l can't go there.
So how do l meet this lady?
Mr. Minister, there is
always a middle path in politics.
Politics is the second
oldest business in the world.
You know the first one.
After meeting you l hae understood..
..there isn't much
difference between the two.
Thanks.
Tell me. - Entire Delhi is
saying l killed Rajde Singh.
But his death is
linked to the 400 crores..
..that you took as bribe so that
Cementec gets the dam contract .
As far as l am concerned,
you are talking rubbish.
Yeah. - lf the entire city
talks the same nonsense..
..then lie also becomes truth.
Which lie is going to come true?
The facts that
Rajde told me about you.
One night prior to his death.
About what?
What did he say?
He said you and Siddharth
Dhanrajgir are together.
Theft. Corruption.
These scoundrels are robbing
the country with both hands.
He een said..
..l hae eidence.
And l will expose them.
Hold on. Eidence? What eidence?
l hae the opposition, media
and CBl to find the eidence.
ln the court l just hae to
say whateer Rajde told me.
There must be a reason
behind your sympathy for me.
We will be together
either in prison or outside.
lt's in your hand.
Just for tonight.
Tomorrow you will be released.
Thank you.
You are ery cunning.
You hae used me so well.
But you are not cunning.
What do you mean?
- l mean..
..you didn't use me till now.
Try me.
Trying is so much
harder than just doing it.
So tell me.
From where do we begin?
lf you want..
..you can remoe this.
And coer the police
file that has my name.
You hae uncoered so much.
lt's ery difficult for me to coer.
So let eerything remain coered.
Minister.
You can't do such a
small thing for me.
lt's not in my hand.
So l am also not in
your hand, Minister.
Done.
Promise.
- Promise.
There is one joy..
..that only you can gie me.
What?
Since childhood l
wanted to work in a bank.
You are the cabinet minister.
Nominate me for the
post of a bank's director.
And then l am all yours.
- That is..
..beyond my power.
l thought you are the most
powerful man in this country.
You are a ery stubborn girl.
The name is llBl bank.
l will see what l can do about it.
llBl bank. Nominate me
for the post of a director.
Okay. l will do it. lt's done.
Good morning, members.
- Good morning, sir
Good morning.
- Good morning, gentlemen.
lf all the members
hae come, shall we begin?
Where is Mr. Khosla?
Sir, the nominee of llBl bank Mr.
Khosla resigned yesterday.
A new member is
coming in his place, sir.
Who is the new member?
Sir, l got the fax from
the ministry just now.
He has not mentioned the name.
- Okay.
Let's start.
- Let's start. Yeah.
Okay.
- Good morning, gentlemen.
l am Kaya Krishna. From llBl bank.
Hi Kumar. Where do l sit?
What...What the hell are

Get out.
- Sid. Sit.
Kumar, where do l sit?
Ms. Kaya Krishna. Please.
Hello gentlemen.
Okay members. The first
point of the agenda is...
Kumar, all this can wait.
Gentlemen, l hae some points.
What the hell are your points?
Sid.
The annual general meeting
is to be held next week.
And l know nothing about the company.
You know l hae joined today itself.
So l want the access to
password of the company accounts..
..balance sheets and all the files.
- What?
l want it now.
This is ridiculous.
Father, this is our company.
This outsider can't come
and dictate terms to us.
Sid..
Kumar, l am waiting.
Yes, Ms. Kaya Krishna. Sure.
- Thanks.
Jasleen, gie her any files,
balance sheets or password she wants.
Okay sir.
The next meeting will be held
once l study all the papers.
Kumar, l'll let you
know when l am ready.
Sorry, gentlemen. Hae
a nice day. You too.
Siddharth...
one of our CEOs is behind bars.
And the other one is dead.
We hae suffered a loss of 1000
crore rupees in the dam project.
And today a prostitute of Delhi
is calling me by my first name.
Who? Your father.
A prostitute is
talking to Kumar Dhanrajgir.
She is now a board member.
l am asking you, Siddharth.
How did she get this far? And why?
Father, it was necessary
to teach her a lesson..
..after her sting operation.
But she got pregnant
and started blackmailing.
Are you a freaking idiot?
Don't you hae brains?
This is the last time l
am telling you something.
Listen carefully.
Sid, business is meant
only for earning money.
Not to exact reenge.
You are losing
eerything in a fight with a girl.
What the hell hae you done? Why?
l promise, father. l'll
fix eerything this time.
lf anything goes wrong
on the day of the AGM..
..Cementec lnfra will be finished.
l hae to take care of
11 more companies, Sid.
l really hope, my son. Whateer
you are saying doesn't happen.
Just...Just see these papers.
See...
l know there are facts in these
papers that can ruin Siddharth.
And l want you to help me out. Please.
Vicky, are you een listening?
Vicky...
Why don't you sleep with
a chartered accountant?
He'll explain to you what's
hidden in these papers. - What?
Translators : Milad Taherkhani & Mohammad Taherkhani
Vicky. Wait. Listen to me.
Darn it. What are you saying?
Vicky, it neer mattered
what eeryone thinks about me.
But you know the truth, don't you?
You know what had happened to me.
What had happened?
Eery time it's about you.
As if there is no
one else in this world.
There are many like me.
But not eeryone fights.
l am fighting.
Fighting what?
You hae sold yourself.
You are forgetting, Vicky. l
was sold in the town square.
No. lt was your choices.
Working with him. Loing him.
And now reenge from him.
You neer asked me
before doing anything.
l am leaing this city.
New city. New people and a new world.
l always felt that you
would neer leae me alone.
You should'e at least
told me that you are going.
l am your friend, Vicky.
- You were my friend.
You are not the Kaya l knew.
You hae killed her.
What has changed between us, Vicky?
Eerything.
You hae finished me
along with Siddharth.
Brick by brick.
l. How?
Because l loed you. Darn it.
Since when?
l loed you when l saw
you for the first time.
l loed you the day

l loed you een when you
threw away my watch as garbage.
l loed you een you slept with
eery man who was helping you.

l just don't feel like

l can't look at you any more.
Vicky.
- Just leae, Kaya. Just go.
Just leae me alone.
While did you change the path.
Why hae you created a distance..
..of centuries
between us in an instance?
You shattered my world of dreams.
Something has
slipped out of my hands.
Oh God, make me meet
someone who neer leaes me.
This separation from
the one l loe is bad.
My fragile heart. You
hae broken my fragile heart.
My fragile heart. You
hae broken my fragile heart.
My fragile heart. You
hae broken my fragile heart.
You can't put
together a broken heart.
l pushed leaing two days back.
- Why?
Because you can fall
in loe number of times.
But you can't hae
friendship again and again.
But for the last time.
Tell me. What do l hae to do?
l am finding this paper bit fishy.
Hae a look at it.
Cementec lnfra bought their
first mini cement plant in 2006.
There is a illage
Naya Majra. lts there.
And this year's
electricity bill is Rs. 28,00,000.
They imported a
packaging plant in 2006.
And the electricity
bill is Rs. 42,00,000.
All fine till here.
After this, in 2008,
Cementec imported two mini plants.
The electricity bill
should'e been three times.
Bu that didn't happen.
The electricity bill dropped
from 42,00,000 to 40,00,000.
ln 2009 and 2010, they imported
three plants more respectiely.
And do you know much the
electricity bill dropped to?
Rs. 4,00,000.
You mean to say there
has been electricity theft.
No, Kaya.
All these cements
plants are only on paper.
That means it's all a big scam.
All these cement factories and
eerything is just on paper.
And there has been a subsidy
scam of billions of rupees.
Shareholders didn't get anything.
But Siddharth Dhanrajgir's
bank accounts kept increasing.
All these foreign accounts and
money is all rooted to Mauritius.
And they themseles
raise their share prices.
Come on, Vicky. Let's go.
- Yes.
Yet another plot of
Siddharth Dhanrajgir.
There is a board. But no factory.
When this news breaks, Siddharth
Dhanrajgir will be behind bars.
Yes. Tomorrow after the AGM.
Mr. Shashtri, Kaya
has got to my boardroom.
But she mustn't get to the AGM.
Do whateer it takes.
Mr. Siddharth, don't worry.
She won't get there.
Drier. Drier...what...
Ask her not to go there. Speak.
Speak, you rascal.
Kaya, don't stop. Just go that AGM.
Beat him. Beat the rascal. Beat him.
Did you watch your
friend's ideo, Kaya Krishna?
Do l need to tell you
what you hae to do next?
Or you hae understood?
l must not see you
anywhere close to the AGM. Got it?
l will call up again as to
what you hae to do next and how.
And one more thing.
- Sir... Sir, please.. Sir... Sir.
lf you mess with me today,
you know what l'll do.
Sir, what are you plans?
- Sir...sir.
Siddharth!
My dear shareholders.
lt gies me great
pleasure to welcome to the..
..7th Annual general
meeting of Cementec lnfra.
This year has proed
to be our golden year.
My son Siddharth has
finalised Mumbai's deal.
So it's natural that we
gift our shareholders.
So the management
has decided. 1 :1 bonus.
And 50% diidend.
And now to present
the auditor's report..
..l inite the managing
director of Cementec lnfra..
..and my son Siddharth Dhanrajgir.
Till the AGM goes on, keep the
rascal alie. - Yes sir. Yes sir.
And then... kill him.
- Okay sir.
Thank you. Thank you.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Gie the rascal some water.
We hae to keep him alie
till the AGM is oer. Go.
Water. Water.
Get him. Get him.
What will happen if he runs away?
He is running away. Get him. Get him.
Get him. Get him.
Don't let him go.
- Shoot him.
He is running away.
What are you doing?
Shoot him down.
Get him. Get him.
He is up there. See. There he goes.
Get him.
Quick. Come on.
Can l make a call?
- Sure.
Vicky, where are you?
Kaya, l am fine.
Go to the AGM. l am fine.
l want to meet you right now.
Don't be foolish. Go to the AGM.
Are you sure? Are you okay?
l am absolutely fine. Go to the AGM.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
- Excuse me, Mr. Dhanrajgir.
The company you were
operating out of lndia last year.
What happened about it?
Yes. We are ery much on track.
Goernment of Malaysia has gien
green light to our packaging plant.
Now the tagline of Cementec
lnfra will not be building lndia..
..but building Asia.
And where will the cement be
manufactured, Mr. Dhanrajgir?
l can't see you.
Yes, we are
importing three new plants.
And would it be wrong to
say that these three plants..
..will also run without electricity?
As the other plants of Cementec run.
Because all these cement
plants are only on paper.
l hae electricity bills of
Cementec lnfra's cement factories.
ln the last four years, as the
production in these plants increased..
..the electricity bill dropped.
Here is the proof.
Distribute please.
After looting lndians..
..Siddharth Dhanrajgir is
now going to loot Asians.
Great.
He is fooling us. He is fooling us.
Sorry, gentlemen.
l am Kaya Krishna. Board member.
Representing lRBl bank.
Yes. Kaya Krishna.
Delhi's famous call girl.
What...is he saying.
- Tell us. Tell us.
Yes. And this is
Cementec lnfra's owner.
Siddharth Dhanrajgir.
And these are Cementec lnfra's shares.
And these are now no more
than scraps just like him.
And the bonus you are getting is
not bonus. lt is bogus like him.
Shut up. Just shut up.
Cementec lnfra is just a name.
Not an industry.
Just Siddharth Dhanrajgir is a
fraud and not a businessman.
Wait. Wait. She
gathers fake eidences.
She defames decent
people and blackmails them.
Tell us the truth.
- She does this.
All of you know about her.
You don't hae any proof of this.
Tell us. Tell us. Tell us.
But l hae proof,
Siddharth Dhanrajgir..
..that you are a thief, a kidnapper..
..a murderer and a rapist.
Siddharth, no.
You had said this once.
And today l am saying this.
One all.
Get out of my way. Moe.
Get out of my way.
Eer Since this year's biggest
corporate fraud came to the light..
..the shares of Cementec lnfra
hae been dropping ery rapidly.
Cementec lnfra's shares
hae plummeted to 35 from 990.
Siddharth Dhanrahgoir could be
arrested any minute now. And...
Darn it.
Come on, father. Pick up
the phone. Pick up the phone.
Sir, your father is here.
Father..
..if you go out looking for reenge,
it will come looking for you.
l really feel sorry for you, Sid.
FlR has been filed against you.
And you could be arrested any minute.
Father...
..please help me. l
don't want to lose like this.
You hae already lost.
Sign these papers.
What papers, father?
Your resignation from
my business and company.
l am forced to chuck you out
of the other companies as well.
l can't take the risk of
being associated with your name.
Father...
- Sign the papers.
Sign the papers.
l said sign the papers.
Father..
..is there no place
for relationships..
..in this war?
- No.
There is no place for
relationships in this war.
And l hae learnt this from you, Sid.
Darn it. God darn it. Darn...
l ruin the people who mess with me.
lt's necessary to keep the person
alie in order to ruin his life.
Death saes you from destruction.
This is what you had said. lsn't it?
You had told me while
giing this watch, Sid.
Remember?
Now my time is changing for the good.
You were right.
Because time has helped
me in exacting reenge..
..from a rascal like you.
The police are
coming up by the eleator.
Wish..
Wish l was working for some newspaper.
l had a scoop.
Siddharth Dhanrajgir behind
