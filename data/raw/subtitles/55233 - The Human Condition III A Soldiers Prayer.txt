Part V
Now we're in their land.
What shall we do?
We've very little choice.
Either to run across or...
Pass those lights?
What else?
Just 30 seconds... to get that
sentry off our backs!
Kaji... shoot him from here!
Then you start running.
It's a good idea, but...
What about me?
Is there any alternative way?
Why don't you sneak up from
behind and stab him?
What shall we do?
What are you doing?
Don't worry about me. Start running!
You're bloody!
Shooting a Russian soidier in the battle,
was just one fire among millions,
which share the guilt of killing people.
But... this morning...
Michiko... I'm a murderer!
These hands which have once...
fondled your charms...
have killed a man!
For the sake of crossing
a mere road in safety!
Was I justified?
Or was it wanton murder?
Michiko! Tell me which is right?
Hon Sup. Pvt.!
How did you do it?
Don't ask me a stupid question.
Anyway, we've come this far.
Concentrate on what's coming!
Where to?
To Mutankiang... we hope.
It's that way.
But it'll be no use.
The Reds took it.
Oh? How about yourself?
Korea... that's where I'm heading.
It's closer to home.
What's your unit?
I had one until yesterday.
Beware the border area.
It's Commie territory.
Is that so?
Well... I'll just be another Red.
What's "comrade" in their lingo?
"Tonzu" in Chinese.
"Dommu," I think in Korean.
"Tonzu" and "dommu", eh? Thanks!
That's all I need. Good luck!
"Tonzu and "dommu", eh?
Bye-bye, dear tonzu!
A real crackpot!
Probably a deserter!
Should've asked his name.
What for?
To report him!
Silly!
You're saying I'm a fool?
I let you take charge only because
you know this area.
I'm still the NCO here!
While I'm here, I give orders!
Forget your rank!
Listen carefully to what I say.
You, too, Terada!
Mutankiang is in enemy hands.
Our Kwantung Army is finished.
It's no use trying to rejoin them now.
Then what shall we do?
We return to our former lives!
We go this way!
That's where my life is.
I'll do my best to restore you
to your former way of life.
If you don't agree with me,
leave me...
we're parting company here!
We might find our army.
You can join them if you like.
It's our duty to join them!
Kaji! It's an army rule.
We're defeated men now.
If you want to fight on,
take Terada and go!
I'm going my way!
Kaji, will we make it?
Nothing but dense woods!
Two full days!
We have no maps, nor compass.
We must press on!
Our only hope!
We're on enemy terrain!
Must be a river.
River!
We're helped.
Like meeting Buddah in Hades!
We're saved! I can feed
my baby again.
Do you realize... we haven't
eaten in 5 days?
Help yourself to this.
What do you think?
Must we take them?
I'm undecided.
We can't leave them.
Our rations are low.
I'll keep it.
Who's a hog?
I won't say... but you can guess!
Well these men gave this to us
to share it! Not only to you.
Have you ever brought any food to share?
Useless scum!
Making passes at the men.
We shared with you at the cost
of my baby's milk.
Harlots!
So what?
We'll go ask the soldiers.
They won't share with us
because we're harlots.
The filthy curs!
Those girls brought nothing
to share in common.
You begged us when the Reds
were raping your women!
Enough!
We all share alike.
Any more trouble and we leave you!
I wish I had a rice cake...
as big as a women's ass!
Even cold rice and soup will do.
Oh, for a belly full!
Will you men stop raving about food?
Yeah, it just makes me feel hungrier.
Kaji! Aren't these edible?
They're snails!
Mmm... great!
Women, it may not be beef but at least
we can get it down.
He's right!
maybe we should try
some of it.
It's the Kwangtung Army's fault!
Those arrogant parlor soldiers!
Hey, we did our best!
Only 3 of us survived...
out of the original 160 men.
They could have evacuated
the women and children.
We always co-operated with them.
At great profit to you?
You should gripe!
Please! Shut that brat up!
Get some sleep! No use griping.
Mommy!
Lay off those!
Play with them and you're dead!
You men have it easy. No children!
They walk too fast for us.
Soldiers... you'll never find
paradise on this earth.
Is that my fault?
In Kaji's pouch... there remains
a bit of paradise!
- What happened to the others?
- Who cares?
They're constantly slowing our pace.
Kaji... let's boil the rice and eat.
No! Not until we find our way out.
Or... when we're all ready to die!
All right? Come on!
You waited for us?
I like your guts!
Well, if we lose you... we're dead!
Come along... don't lose heart.
I won't let you die alone.
Forgive our slow pace.
Age can be an insurmountable barrier.
We'll keep walking until it's all over.
I'll always be with you.
It's all of us who are starved!
My baby is starving!
Even my husband is about finished!
So are we all.
Just a little, please!
For my baby and husband.
I won't touch it.
No!
Make do with what you can find.
My baby's dying!
The ones who survives...
eats this rice. It's not for the dying.
You mean you're the one who will eat it?
If we're not out of here tomorrow
we'll be dead anyway!
Live if you want to eat! Now, sleep!
Somebody... help!
My baby! My baby!
What'll I do?
My baby is dead! Dead!
Help me, someone!
Call a doctor!
Shut up! we're all dying.
How about your husband?
Pipe down! You drive me nuts!
Let her cry it out.
Let's go.. or we'll all die!
Get up... hurry! We mustn't stay here.
Will you shut up!
Too bad!
There goes our next meal.
Some marksman!
I'm sorry! My eyes are falling.
Where's the others?
The elder told us to go ahead.
They suddenlly doubled up in pain.
And they vomited blood.
Mushrooms?
If you want to die, use my rifle!
Who else ate the stuff?
They did! And it looked so good.
We've had enough of you.
Leave us to die in peace!
Let me bury the child.
He's dead!
And you killed him!
How many died today!
Where's your family?
What is it to you?
Nothing... I just asked.
Put them out of misery, that's what!
Seems there were other who were lost.
I won't give up!
Can we make it?
We'll see tomorrow morning.
We caught them. One is ours!
No! We share equally.
Don't try to pull rank on us.
You failed to shoot the bird.
We get one snake.
Go ahead... I'll shoot you.
Don't think you're the
only one who can shoot.
Stop it!
Don't behave like little kids.
She's right!
What's got into us?
Kaji... we'll share the snake
if you'll ration the rice.
Wait till tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow...
Will we get out?
I don't know.
You know how I feel?
When my unit was wiped out...
I survived the shootings.
I think my luck is going to hold.
Then... if I stick to you,
will I get out, too?
It's one way of looking at it.
Wherever you go,
I'll always be with you.
Let's hope for tomorrow.
How are things down in the south?
I've a sister there.
My only living kin...
And she's not the kind
of women I've become.
Are you going there?
Will you take me?
I hope they're safe!
They must be safe!
That's all the rice I have.
I'm breaking out of here at all cost!
I refuse to stop till I get it.
Stick with me.
Damn!
He's a fast walker!
I'd stick if I weren't injured.
Kaji,
you once called me an idiot.
I won't forget it.
You saved me from the tanks.
I won't forget it.
Are you man or beast?
Damn it!
That bastard!
Where does that cur
get all his energy, anyway?
Damn! I'll be eternally disgraced...
A full Corporal taking orders
from a Private!
Oh... I should've died
a hero's death in battle.
I'd be deified and having it easy.
The idiot!
We'll never make it out of these woods.
Help will come to us.
Why should we keep walking? I quit!
How are you, Chief?
I think he's leading us
in the wrong direction.
This leads us to Vladivostok.
I've given up.
I'm quitting!
Get up!
Ume-chan... Ume!
I can still walk.
But... where does all this lead?
All this walking...
Is it worth the trouble?
The southern border might be...
another mass grave for the Japanese.
We probably have no place
to go or to live.
Wait! Don't kill her.
I'm coming back... to face charges.
Michiko!
Are you still alive?
Can you imagine what
I'm going through...
to return to your side?
Will we find our way out today?
Terada!
Look! Do you see it?
What do think?
A dwelling?
Or other humans.
Someone lives there!
It's too early to rejoice yet.
Let's wait for the others.
Remnants of Ushijima Unit?
Yes, sir!
From the Doi group?
Yes sir!
The Ushijumi Battalion was wiped out.
What about Lt. Doi?
Dead sir.
Why are you alive?
Why didn't you fight on?
You dare live with your
commander dead?
Must be deserters!
And women! What does
this mean? Explain yourself!
No, I won't. All we want is food.
Never! We can't spare it.
After reaching the Korean border,
we are making our last stand.
We've got no food for cowards.
Get out!
Move on or we'll hang you all!
Captain Nagata, eh?
Keep your bloody supplies!
I'll blow your head off! Don't move!
Don't move!
Terada... shoot if they make a move.
Damned parlor soldiers
in dress uniforms!
Why don't you say you just want
to keep your supplies?
You ran off with your supplies,
leaving us to be wiped out!
Kaji... while we were at it,
we should have filched some supplies.
Hell with supplies! That dog!
Corporal Hironaka,
those are the men you wanted to join.
What a filthy man!
Someone comes!
Nice work, Kaji.
Remember me?
Tange?
Yes... I'm Tange.
You scared the hell out of me.
You look tough with those whiskers.
You've certainly changed!
Kill or be killed...
we'll talk about that later.
Eat some of this.
Was the war over?
It must be.
If so, what will be the outcome?
Like Germany...
Unconditional surrender!
Yes.
But after that...
what about us?
what happens to the people?
The big question.
Defeat... means national collapse?
What is the nation?
The country you knew will be dead.
It should be.
We've been struggling to survive.
How to give birth to the country
where men are free?
That's the question.
I hope democratic forces
will unite...
to cope with this defeat.
Japan has such forces?
They're mostly helpless creatures
like myself.
They're no use.
Why so cynical?
The test is to come.
Beside the point.
We entered military service...
and fought in battle.
Wiped out... and trudging aimlessly on.
Killers who failed our buddies.
How many of us are qualified
for coping with defeat?
That enough!
Even your ideas seem distorted.
Hey I found one!
A corn field!
Fast asleep.
He seems greatly relieved
since you joined us.
He had it rough.
But you... a woman... how'd you manage
to do it? I'm amazed!
I just keep on going.
How often I thought I wouldn't make it!
But he was much nicer than he looks.
And I wanted to see my sister.
- Where is she?
- In Taishihkiao.
It's near Kaji's place?
Yes, that's why I'm with him.
We don't have to worry about food.
There's plenty.
Stop that!
Stand up!
We mean you no harm.
We just ask you our way
Have any Russians come this way yet?
Dog! He's pretending to be deaf.
We only wish to return home.
Which way is Jinpohu?
Thank you.
Damn! We've been tricked.
That cur! Should've shot him!
We raid their fields. So they hate us.
Strange! How come they're armed?
Taken from our troops?
They must have formed their
own militia.
Come on. Let's run away.
There's no retreat now.
We're pushing on.
Hi! You're just on time.
Our scouts blundered
and things are a bit nasty.
Front line unit?
Remnants of...
That's great!
What do you think of this plan?
While they search for us over there,
you cover us from here...
and we'll make those woods.
And then...
we'll cover you from there
Sounds good.
But not for us.
Why is that?
How are your scouts?
See where those men are?
They got it there...
You shut up!
You didn't help?
How could we? Not enough men!
Then you might desert us, too?
You'll stay here with me.
My men will go first.
If you agree to this,
we'll cooperate with you.
You don't trust us?
Wait! Why not wait till dark?
There's no time.
They've already spotted us here.
He's right.
Re-tie your laces!
Fire at random! Pin 'em down!
Come on! It's our turn.
- Does it hurt?
- Just a scratch.
Damn! I'm dead tired.
Poor Ujiie! They got him.
Killed?
Having a field day!
They formed militia...
The war must be over.
If so there'd be proclamations
urging our surrender.
How come they are just trying to kill us?
Would you surrender?
Afraid not.
Yeah! P.O.W. has no freedom.
We may be paying dearly
for our worthless freedom.
Blast it! It's getting cold.
If you listened to me,
we'd be sitting pretty by this time.
The closer we come to town,
the more intimidated he is.
We don't have to be so afraid
of armed Chinese.
You okay?
Yes,
except for the shivering.
How's your leg?
A bit painful...
that's all.
I've come to realize how nice
it is to have shelter.
I never realized before...
but now I understand.
Know what I mean?
It's so nice to have a home...
for protection from the rain.
Michiko.
Such fleeting happiness!
For the joys we shared...
at the cost of Chinese sacrifices.
I am now paying dearly.
And I must kill and steal...
or I cannot fight my way back to you.
Michiko, Is a new life possible for us?
Can we start anew?
No village in sight.
Strange! But shall we rest here?
Such pigs!
Someone lives here.
There's no threat.
A roof overhead, at least!
We'll stop here for rest.
Great! I'll grab the pig.
Aroma of steaming fat
reminds of that Russian place.
What a joint! It was great!
Honey... and as much meat
as you want!
Female flesh, too!
This wretch!
The gal had her legs spread...
and he stands shaking.
You lucky dog!
About this time,
we were eating snails in the woods.
Enough of that!
Touch another women
and your dead!
Why not the white and Chinese dames?
They're raping our women!
It's war! Eye for an eye!
These eggs obviously don't know me!
I can guess.
Well, stop being a square
each passing day of your lifetime.
A horrible wound!
It's healed now.
Kaji cleaned it out with gunpowder.
Kaji did it?
Hey, shall I wash your body?
- Pretty ass!
- Get away from me!
Must be itching by now!
It's a baffling.
A true oasis for those of us
rejected by society.
Let's go out. Too dark in here.
Get the men! We're moving on.
Danger is everywhere.
Let them relax a bit.
Am I too harsh?
You tend to drag others up to
the level of your own ability.
That's how you are...
Of course, that's probably why
you're alive today.
We move on!
Go away! I'm shedding!
I'm all for it.
Never seen a naked woman?
You must haven't made love for so long.
How about with me?
Not with you!
You have nothing to lose...
even if I can't pay you.
Come on! How about it?
Touch me and I'll yell!
Put on your clothes!
You're too careless.
Mind your own affairs, Hon. Private!
Now move. We're leaving!
I'll listen to your excuse later.
Stop teasing the men!
I'm not teasing.
Once your out of danger,
you're so easy to be careless.
What does it mean?
To hell with you!
I prefer him to you.
So what?
Just remember... danger lurks.
You could bring us trouble.
I'll not trouble you anymore.
Hey, stop it!
The dog! He was spying on us.
Maybe he lives here. We ate his pig.
Good for you.
If I hadn't been crapping out there,
we'd be in hot water now.
You live here?
I'm sorry we killed your pig.
What nonsense you're talking!
Break the wall.
They're coming!
Hurry up!
Will Kaji make it?
What'll we do if he doesn't?
We'll make out. He's no god himself.
We know our way around, too.
As of now, I quit running...
and start fighting.
Kill us if they want!
But why non-combatants?
Women?
We're all on edge.
That's no reason!
Such logic justifies nothing.
His guts were hanging out.
I finished him.
The dogs! Did a horrible thing to her.
Where's the men?
Out there somewhere. Go find them.
I'll bury the girl.
- I'll bury the others.
- The Manchu?
Any objections?
If you're burying the girl,
you can also bury the Manchus.
But I'll do it for you.
I wish we could keep going
under cover.
If they spot us, it will be the end.
Here they come.
Don't rush. They're too far.
There must be others. What'll we do?
Can't let our goose be cooked too.
Let's hurry along.
What a pillage job!
No wonder we're unwelcome.
But we can't die because of their guilt.
Damn! This is getting serious.
What shall we do? We're surrounded.
Can't budge!
We did no damage!
You didn't?
Kaji! We see smoke from the rear.
Let's run for it.
It's no use.
They'll get us as we come out.
It's time to give up.
Let's surrender.
Fool!
Surrender without firing a shot?
They don't want us alive... just dead!
That's why they caught fire.
Team up, men! We're going.
There's the fire line! It's safest!
Terada, come!
A narrow escape!
We'll wait till dawn.
We made it but
I don't approve of your methods.
Lost another man.
Meaning Hironaka?
I'm not blaming you.
I understand.
When we reach the railroad,
we'll learn the truth.
We'll part there.
Japanse refugees!
Looks like they're mostly women.
Should we call?
Wait! Let's wait a bit longer.
What is it?
Don't look!
I can't believe it!
The Red army wouldn't rape...
Only Japanese women.
When prison conveys pass,
the sight is really sickening.
Any women will do!
Women in defeat are doomed!
There must be knaves
in even the Red Army.
One in millions!
But existence of a few proves nothing.
It doesn't underestimate
the theory of the Red...
no... People's army.
A flaw of the transition period.
It will soon be corrected.
The Red Army must be different
from the Japanese Army in Nazi.
Not even like the Americans!
Minor facts ignored in history.
can be important to the individual.
He who has such failings
can never erase it out of the memory.
The blood of hate will continue
to seep from the wounds.
A breeding ground of distrust.
The insult to humanity...
How do you defend it?
Are Reds down south like that, too?
I have faith.
Hon. soldiers-
Are you headed south?
We we're visiting our uncle
when the hostiles broke out.
And your parents?
I don't know.
Going to Korea?
No, back to Peihutow.
Though we're not sure
what we'll find there.
Will you take as far as the lake?
How old are you?
Eighteen.
We're fast walkers.
We'll keep up. We did this far.
Had any trouble en-route?
We had geisha girls with us.
They sacrificed themselves.
And... they?
They took them away.
They said that kid went
off his rocker.
Saw them raping his sister.
Enough!
I'm sorry!
Resting so often for our sake.
Takes good care of you, eh?
He'll revive when we're home.
I can't let anything happen
before I return him to our parents.
Feels great! Try it.
Not like me, at all!
That's better! Fine!
Junpohu very far off?
Very near now.
Just follow this road.
We're you heading for?
We're going back to Korea.
Excuse me...
Is Peihutow still safe?
I come from a village some distance
away. I can't tell you.
I think they evacuated.
All Japanese farmers...
have left the sectors already.
Follow the lake from here
and you'll find Peihutow.
Yes... for some 20-odd miles.
Can you make it by yourselves?
Yes, we'll be all right.
I've been thinking about
what that Korean told us.
Even if you return there,
you'll find your mother and father gone.
It may be unwise for you to go.
If you have no place to go,
you can come with me.
Then you could contact your parents.
Or return to Japan.
Isn't that wiser?
I will keep on.
If... if my parents are gone,
there's still our Chinese friends.
I'll escort them.
How about it? Let's see them home.
Okay, sister?
I'm sick of walking.
We'll rest awhile and consider our future.
But.. what if they're gone?
Well... we'll join the guerrillas.
Make her our leader.
They're walking fast.
They're in a hurry.
But Hon. Squad Leader...
what if there's no one there?
Don't worry! Just leave it to me.
The witch! What a tempting body!
Strange...
They've been after us
with fire and anti-tank guns...
and over look spots like this.
It's paradise!
Hi, buddy! What unit?
Border unit.
Damn! We lost the war?
The big brass dragged us out
to this Hell-hole!
They should take
care of us to get out.
You may be right.
But they're all prisoners
or have returned to Japan.
But we've lost...
The Americans taking Japan
and the Russians taking Manchuria?
No, the Soviets will not.
They will return to Chaing Kai-shek?
Maybe... at least they'll be Chinese.
The Russians wants nothing.
Their sole aim has always been
liberation of China.
You mean... the Reds did all
that for nothing?
Tange
The liberation...
how will they go about
accomplishing it?
Chinese Communists...
Through revolution.
Civil war?
You guys communists?
Why don't you go to the Russians
with your tails wagging?
We have no tails!
Fake commies, eh?
That's better! Be careful.
It' cold outside! Like winter.
Boy, were we happy when we saw
this place from the woods!
Making a final stand there?
Plenty of supplies! What's the plan?
Hikita..
where'd you leave that girl?
Where'd they go?
We took her to the hill overlooking
her home.
She left us there.
You liar!
That's 80 km more than I made today.
And what if we are lying?
What's it to you?
If you're worried, why don't you go?
Didn't get a chance at her
because I escorted her.
Despite efforts to impress her.
She was worked over with the Reds.
She had nothing to lose!
And so what?
I let her have it.
Without the kid gloves!
Meaning what?
Want to know? Her honor is now safe.
What've you curs done? Talk!
Get out of here!
I'm confiscating your weapons.
Terada, disarm them!
You bastard! Crawl now on all fours.
Part VI
Who's there?
Show yourself!
Get out of sight or they'll spot you.
Hey, you fellows!
You can't go down there.
Why?
They're mopping up.
The road is down by those woods.
Our lines end there.
What's going on here?
We're dug in!
Go see our commander.
He'll be brief. Then you can decide.
We're entrenched here.
Our troops are of the best...
armed with machine guns and mortars.
We'll manage until next year.
After next year... then what?
I'm getting to that!
You know what's happening in Japan?
And how about Manchuria?
Will Russia return it to China?
They will... I'm sure
To whom? Chiang Kai-shek?
No, not to Chiang.
Wouldn't he want it?
He'll try to get it with the U.S. aid.
Will the Reds fight?
They will.
Good!
We seem to agree there.
The U.S. will back Chiang in driving...
all communists out of Manchuria.
Just wait... there'll be civil war!
And not too far off, either!
That's when we get into action!
With you 50-odd men?
Numerical strength means nothing.
Only spirit counts!
We'll join the Nationalist Forces...
It's suicide!
You're wasting the lives of
the troops you lead.
How about yourself?
You lead your own men to
meet a dog's death!
That's not true!
They're sick of fighting.
They only want to go home.
Why should they risk their lives
for the Americans or Chiang?
Then go! Keep moving!
Don't interrupt!
We've plenty of supplies.
Those who wish to join us...
make your own choice.
We'll camp nearby.
We'll depart early tomorrow.
I talked to some of their men.
Seems impossible to break out.
The scouting party was wiped out...
by a Red punitive expedition.
Does that prove that it'll be
safer to remain here?
Those who wish can stay.
Winter's coming.
We'll have to hurry.
A long way yet.
Can we break through?
They're bound to spot us.
The woods are dense. Why worry?
Tange feels we should surrender.
Where's Sup. Private Kaji?
Over there.
Kaji?
Over here.
Mind if we join you?
We've had enough of war.
You can do as you like.
Want me to inform your commander?
Don't do it!
Desertion will mean
facing the firing squad!
Then how are you gonna
leave the troupe?
We'll slip out and join you later.
As long as we get out of this place,
we'll be alright.
We vowed we'd remain together...
until death tore our ties asunder.
You can't shoot them!
The army is disbanded!
You have no authority.
This is none of your business!
The fact that you broke their vow
is a minor matter.
But it could affect others.
It is our conviction, that the best way...
is to bide our time and do battle!
We waste words, sir!
Sup. Private Kaji!
Just shut up and get out!
Our men are raring to go!
Let them try!
We'll see about your discipline.
Nothing but a pack of bandits!
So what? I'll cut your head off
like a bandit!
Wait!
Call your leader.
He conspired with these men.
I'd not advise it.
He's ill-tempered like this one.
Mabye more so!
I am here.
Tange... step back!
Commander... can we make a deal?
I've some men that want to join you
I'm willing to swap.
They're are welcome to join us.
But deserters can't go unpunished.
Kitago... execute them!
Tange... pick up the rifle!
Commander... we're leaving now.
You'll be wiped out before winter.
But not us... we're going!
- What's that on their backs?
- Flame-thrower!
Without even advance or rear guards!
They're a pushover from here.
Go it alone then!
Let's go!
I'm giving myself up.
You're going?
After you move on,
I'm going over to them.
Call out before going,
with arms raised.
We'll meet again.
If we survive.
Maybe you're right...
and I'm wrong.
Who knows?
Let's just hope.
A woodpecker.
Why so worried?
As quiet as death!
I hope we can sleep
under a roof tonight.
Split up here!
My poor back!
I've about had it!
If we hadn't split our party,
we'd be dead.
When this chattered... I went cold!
Now I'll try it.
Don't take their weapons.
Why? There will help us.
Not necessarily.
If we're caught with those guns,
we'd be executed!
They'll hear that and think that they won.
Use up their ammunition.
Then we're moving on.
That's no village.
Settlement, maybe?
Probably.
What'll we do?
Let's find out.
Maybe what the commander said
was right.
We might be on the threshold
of civilized society.
Split into fours!
300-400 meters between groups!
We'll go first.
If anything happens to us
you can run or give yourself up.
Our whole future hangs on...
what happens here.
Where are you men heading?
Past the railroad to the south.
Only three of you?
No, fifteen men are behind us.
You may not know,
but the railroad is some
10 kilometers from here.
Just beyond that
is the P.O.W. Camp.
Were there any soldiers
passing through here?
They come by here quite often.
Bringing nothing but trouble.
They stagger in half-starved.
We have nothing left to share!
They've completely looted our fields.
Our main concern now is...
what is to become of us?
What should we do?
Where did the soldiers go?
They went in various directions.
The chatter of automatic rifles
always followed in their wake.
It is doubtful if any have survived.
Do enemy troops ever make trouble?
At first, we feared and loathed them.
But they're nicer than our own men.
And they bring us bread!
All in all, they're as naive as babies.
If we're nice to them, we're safe.
Not like our troops...
who seek loot and a free ride!
You intend to remain overnight?
With our doubtful reputation,
I won't insist on it.
We can camp out.
Could you do us a favor?
Though the Russians promise
to look after us,
we can't wait.
I realize it might cause you trouble...
What is it?
They grow corn and potatoes...
in a field some distance from here.
So you want us to steal?
It is an evil thing we ask...
but the girls will do the work.
I only ask that your men
protect them from any harm.
I understand! We'll do it.
Wait for us nearby.
Don't come too close!
Japanese!
It's cold outside, even with a fire.
Why don't you come inside.
I've kept a spot for you.
No sentry duty?
I'll stay up a while longer.
We'll take shifts.
It may shock the lad.
What?
After all... they're sleeping together.
And there are more women than men!
Are you angry with me?
For mentioning the Reds?
Not at all.
But... you think I'm filthy.
That's it... isn't it?
No...
You women...
are you married?
Yes.
Need we starve because of it?
Must we bite our tongue off?
Who said so?
How many of us...
can return to our normal lives...
if we ever get home.
During a fleeting night with the men,
the girls talk of returning home together.
When locked in one's embrace,
it even seems possible!
But at dawn... it's all over!
The men become jittery...
grab their weapons... and sneak off.
Soldier... you listening?
I hear you.
Women waste no tears!
They're waiting
for the soldier who'll take them away.
We'll never get home.
Nor will we ever see our loved ones.
We don't know if we'll survive!
That's how it is. We're damned!
We think of only eating...
to keep ourselves strong.
There's no hope left.
No happy reunions in sight.
It's our common fate. It's maddening.
It's maddening!
Our common fate...
never get home...
No hope of reunion...
No place to return...
Never meet our loved ones...
Let's go inside.
It's safe at night.
No one will come tonight.
You go on inside.
I'll find some place to sleep.
Good-conduct men, eh?
You're quite a rare bird.
Too good to be dallying with my kind!
Are you saying I'd buy you
with stolen food?
Michiko-
Michiko-
And walking towards you!
If you weren't waiting...
I could never carry on another step!
There's trouble brewing.
Some want to stay here
or take their women.
How about you?
Seemed like a good idea while it lasted.
It was quite a night!
What's with you?
You're acting like a Zen priest!
No tails wagged your way?
None of your business.
I'm thinking of disbanding here.
Last night I really learned how...
to appreciate women!
Why not discard our weapons
and join them as refugees?
Women walk too slow!
They'd be getting in our way.
Not necessarily!
With men it's kill or be killed.
With women...
they might go easy on us.
Some of the men would prefer
to accompany us.
It's time we did something.
This may be our last chance!
But if we run into any Reds?
Men can fight their way out-
but who knows what horrible fate
would await us?
That lad... he's really afraid of you.
Why?
You tend to intimidate people.
Just remember... I seduced him!
Not my concern!
It is!
I hear you saved his life.
He insists on going with you.
So I'm coming along too.
Don't mind, do you?
This isn't play!
The past week we have
made Terada a man.
Not that bad after all!
You were probably his first women.
You were probably his first women.
Though any man would do for you,
he is still naive.
You are partly responsible.
And stay away from me!
I'm human too!
The girls insist on being allowed...
to accompany you.
Become a refugee and take them along.
Wait till night fall,
and take them as far as
the railroad.
T
hey can go their own separate ways.
It's not very long! Let's do it.
Is it too much?
I've heard of various opinions
from the men and the women.
I don't know which is best.
It might be best if we formed
separate groups.
You would then have free choice.
How about you?
I'm going straight on.
And weapons?
I go armed!
Are you sure you'll make it?
No. But I'll try.
I'm leaving now.
Terada,
you'd better remain here.
You can pass as a young refugee.
Bury your rifle and bayonet.
I won't stay!
I'm going!
How about her?
She's depending on you.
You also wanted to be depended on.
She's nothing!
You rejected her... so...
Stop imagining things!
She's not interested in either of us.
She just wants male protection.
You can supply that.
Keep trailing me and
you'll never become a man.
Emergency alarm!
Enemy troops!
Take cover!
Women... hide.
How many?
About twenty... Soviet and Militia.
Fire when I fire!
Then... the grenades!
Automatics first!
Wait till I fire!
Stop... please!
Don't do it!
What will happen to us? Please!
Please... men...
don't do it!
Drop your weapons!
We surrender.
Terada, stay behind...
with the women!
Stop crying!
It's not over yet.
Just starting!
Forward!
Get back in line!
In line!
Terada... get up!
Halt!
Halt!
No sitting down!
Get up! Keep walking!
Interpreter!
What made them halt?
Who gave orders to halt?
- From the rear.
- It came from the rear.
Who was it?
Better step forward!
The commander's mad.
Otherwise the whole unit...
gets three days hard labor without food.
Who was it? Step forward!
Who's responsible?
You did it. Step forward!
Go ahead!
I'm the one.
Fool! Why'd you do such a thing?
I didn't mean to.
I didn't think they'd stop.
But I did wish they would.
He just wanted the column to halt.
That's the commander's prerogative.
It's insubordination!
You are a prisoner.
Just do as you're told.
Explain what I'm saying.
The commander doesn't know.
The men are hit by diarrhea.
This is inhuman!
I may have done wrong,
but I want him to understand.
He says men in the rear
have diarrhea.
The guard kicked one of these men.
He wants the case investigated.
He claims one of you kicked a prisoner.
Is that true?
There must be no maltreatment
of prisoners.
Also... disciplinary violations
by prisoners...
will be punished!
Fascist samurai!
Let you off this time! Be careful!
Says you're a Fascist samurai!
Forward!
Filthy dog!
Excuse me.
It's okay. Forget it!
Fascist samurai? Great!
Shut up!
I, Noge, assume command of this work
detail by orders of the Soviets.
The fortune of war was turned against us,
and we are in defeat.
But our country still remains.
Some day we shall return to our homes.
A Japanese respects all authority.
We must endeavor to show
the Red army...
this national trait.
Our labor quotas must be met!
Only then I will be
in a position to demand...
improvement of your labor conditions,
with Russian officers
Endeavor to maintain good health...
and bear these bitter trials...
and await the rebuilding...
of our father country!
That's all.
They get officers' rations.
They should not talk!
Can't be helped. That's the law!
Oh? Discrimination even among Reds?
Terada-
From tomorrow,
pretend you're ill and stay behind.
After we're gone,
go rummage through their
garbage heap.
Potato peelings, carrot scraps, anything!
It'll add to our rations.
If not... we'll starve!
We can't die yet!
Back to work! On your feet!
How can we without eating?
Come on, fellas, we're wanted!
What are you doing?
Making clothes... out of sacks.
What if they find out?
You have a good uniform,
but I come directly from battle.
I warn you! Don't!
Though a mere gunny-sack,
it's still enemy property.
You disgrace us!
Just leave me alone.
It's the cold season.
I'm wearing these gunny-sacks.
Unless you find me something better.
It's a hard work.
It's not too bad.
Except for that icy water.
After washing the food, I feel better.
I know we'll all live another day.
When I hear the singing,
I feel they must be good.
Their life must be good...
outside the army.
When I joined up, I was so ignorant.
As you once said
"You fool!"
"Death in battle is a dog's death!"
You remember?
It was true.
We came a long way!
I didn't expect it to end up like this.
But I don't mind.
I'm beginning to realize how dear
life can be.
This is the start.
It's rock bottom.
Now we can only go up!
Kitchen duty men
usually chatter about women.
He's unusual!
He's talking about philosophy!
Then you stay behind!
I'll go work.
Ignore the bum!
He has the bad habit...
of sneering at serious conversation.
I'd hoped for this meeting.
It's not mutual.
Are rapist-crooks
allowed to run free in here?
I used my brains!
I'm one of the "active" elements here.
Me... Kirihara!
And your buddies?
Gone... to Siberia!
Must keep my eyes open.
Can't allow violations!
Kaji!
My day has come!
I must live... to see that dog unmasked!
If I talked 'down' to you,
I'll correct that.
After all, we must be
'democratic' from now on.
You're a good worker,
but I hear you've ben sabotaging us.
No sabotage. He's a sick man.
It can't be helped!
I can't allow it.
The Red's officers are angry.
Though not your fault,
other groups are pulling
the same trick.
That's how they see it.
If this continues, they threaten
to send us to North Siberia,
from where no one ever returns.
That's how it is. What do you think?
I'm not impressed!
What was it that you wished?
No more sabotage!
On our rations, you'll live.
We must protect ourselves.
The Soviets are granting you...
the privileges of military rank.
If you'll guarantee us protection,
I'll gladly change my ideas.
I'm P.O.W. myself.
You seem to enjoy defying officers.
Not enjoyment... it's necessity!
Then you refuse to end the sabotage?
It may not be right,
but it can't be helped.
We can't let you do as you like.
Big aims demand some sacrifice!
We may be forced to
deliver you to the Reds!
Yes, Mr. Noge!
I've faith in the future of socialism.
And in my countrymen!
I will work.
But I must also preserve
the strength of those around me.
And that's it!
Such elements will bring
trouble in the future.
Cope with him now!
What did Nage want?
Watch out or they'll take us off...
this light labor detail!
You never work anyway.
It's guys like you
who weaken my argument.
All I get is complaints!
You're a good egg, but stupid!
A serious life isn't always the best.
Delirious times call for
delirious measures.
You're too naive!
A knaves logic, eh?
I'll show you what real labor means!
Dog! Loafing has made you go soft.
Stop it!
That's enough!
Regardless of the reason,
that's going too far!
How can you stand there laughing?
Never treat your men like this.
Rest quietly... or you'll
end up like that, too.
I won't die!
Not after coming this far.
I've had worse than this.
Get some rest.
Get a fire going.
Minegawa!
Interpreter Minegawa!
One of my men needs to go to the hospital.
They're packed!
They're releasing even the uncured.
Then get him some aspirin.
Can't... only in-patients.
I'll go ask. Will you interpret?
Sorry... I'm busy!
Can't be bothered with patients.
You know... you'd better get to work.
It's going too far.
Am I a suspect again?
Not you alone... but the
Red officers are mad at...
the reactionary elements!
Superior Private; 1 year,
9 months of service.
Previous employment:
labor supervisor.
Exploitation of labors, eh?
Yes... something like that.
Hey, what did he say?
I can't answer.
This is not a court.
I pronounce no sentence.
But resistance and negligence...
cannot be condoned.
You will be assigned to a detail
pulling up railroad tracks.
There are no barbed-wire enclosures,
but there can be no resistance or escape.
To attempt either means starvation!
For sabotage, you're getting hard labor.
If you request or attempt escape,
you will starve to death.
That's ridiculous!
I don't mind work,
but be human! Let me have my say!
Tell him that.
What did he say?
What you say is nonsense.
And stupid!
Rascal!
Fascist dog!
What was that?
You wretch...
Somewhere... I have seen you before.
You're the one...
the samurai!
I'd expect it from you!
The worst in the world are Nazi dogs.
The next are Japanese like you!
The meeting took considerable time.
What's going on? You look angry.
This one is a notorious Fascist,
Comrade!
An organizer of sabotage!
He dared to call us stupid!
This one who is addressed
as, "Comrade" -
He might be...
a Party member.
If only I could talk!
Stupid Minagawa!
I have so much to tell you.
It'd take all night.
However You'd never understand.
Explain why the sabotage.
Forget the fancy stuff!
I escaped with my life...
from the field of battle.
But now I am convinced...
that I have run too far.
It was an error of romantic miscalculation.
Russia's so called "historic mission"-
sacrifices the individual...
and tries to justify it.
Just or not... the individuals suffer.
They must protect themselves.
We have no choice!
After the battle was over,
did you ever attack any of us?
I did.
Also the Chinese?
I did.
That makes you guilty of war crimes.
I could deny it... no evidence!
You... you deny that your troops...
committed rape and pillage, right?
You deny it... though it be futile.
I admit my faults...
and would point out yours.
Whether I was denounced by Kirihara
or that officer, Noge,
it does not matter...
what matters...
is that you use such mento...
censure me for protecting my men,
by sifting though your garbage heap.
Due to emergency, supervision is amiss,
good is supressed and evil tolerated.
The fact that Socialism is
better than Fascism,
won't keep us alive.
Stand up!
You look angry.
You seem to dislike...
our repartition of the work which doesn't...
consider your situation, right?
If given more time a democratic
movement will grow among you...
and all will be well.
You must wait...
not move on your own!
You admit to sabotage.
Such acts are not to be condoned.
Your leader has agreed to send you...
to work on the railroad.
It's only one week. You must submit.
Anything else?
If possible... I'd like an aspirin.
He wants medicine.
He says his friend is ill.
I'll get it for you tomorrow.
You'll return, won't you?
One new life... remember?
If you're not up when I get back,
you're a weakling!
Look after him.
Going away, huh?
Do me a favor?
What?
About Terada...
You wanted revenge on me?
You've had it.
But he's still. See that he gets food.
No problem to a "comrade".
You can't butter me up!
Squealed about Noge and me,
but it didn't help, eh?
Too bad!
While you're sleeping in the cold,
think what price you'll pay
for kicking me out!
Here... have some!
I'll get you.
Kaji
It's you?
Tange!
It was stupid to run.
Also to be caught.
I might as well try again.
Are you sure you'll make it?
I couldn't say.
You'll be captured, killed,
or frozen to death.
Not like you to trust in luck.
Why do you fear Siberia?
If you can't survive... no one can!
Send me to Siberia
and forced labor if they will.
Their "Freedom" is phony!
Exploiting our labor and then
re-educating us.
Is that their way?
It's not the amount of work.
Nor the short rations.
And even their guards...
sleep on the ground with us.
What I'm saying... most prisoners
aren't enemies of their class struggle!
Their treatment of such men...
seems lacking in co-ordination.
In what way?
I may be wrong.
But they seem a bit self-centered.
Can't be helped!
Their strategy calls for a
Soviet First policy.
Can't be helped?
They're only human...
can't be helped!
History will correct it.
That's not for us.
I'm fed up!
If they ship me off to Siberia,
I'm staking my life on that.
Terada!
Wake up... Terada!
I warned him not to try again,
but he insisted on getting up.
And he went out after more food.
And Kirihara caught him.
He was beaten and given latrine duty.
We carried him limp and stinking
to the hospital, but it was too late!
He died... calling your name.
You may not believe me,
but I took the case to Noge!
He wouldn't listen.
The guards knew?
Yes, but they say it wasn't a crime.
No direct evidence.
Tange...
I've changed my mind!
I'm breaking out!
Don't stop me.
I'm making a mistake... but I'm going!
The big shot wants to see you about me.
At this time of the night?
I'm challenging you to a duel.
Are you afraid?
You're crazy!
We'll need Minigawa.
No need for interpreters.
There's one waiting.
Are you coming? Or will you apologize?
That's a laugh!
Siberia is too good for you.
This way!
You dog!
Had enough?
Stop it... please!
Please... I apologize!
I thought so!
Scum!
Die, you dog! You deserve it.
Your kind deserves to be liquidated!
Good people are suffering
because of you!
Die!
Kaji-san!
Terada?
Are you still following me?
Don't Terada.
If you follow in my footsteps,
you'll never grow to be a man.
No! You're already a man.
You need to be ashamed of nothing!
I'm walking on!
If I lose my way,
you must guide me.
You're a man now! You must guide me.
Have I done wrong?
I never erred!
Tange is off in Siberia.
That rascal probably...
despises and envies me!
Michiko!
Let me laugh if they want!
I'm returning to you.
I'm still walking on.
I'll beg for food at that village,
then continue on to you.
Buzz off, beggar!
Are you deaf?
Get out of here!
You thieving rascal!
Thief!
This one is Japanese!
Look! A Japanese pig!
Michiko, forgive me!
I've come as far as I'm able.
Michiko, look... I've come this far!
Michiko!
I saved this for you.
I'll bring you this bread.
It's a manto for you.
My only souvenir.
After 700-odd days of being away,
that's all I have.
I had to kill many men,
to come back to you.
Killed many men!
Don't hate me for it!
I'm coming home.
Even as I'm walking towards you.
Michiko...
do you still await my return?
I'm so happy!
I knew you'd return... no matter what!
Your whiskers! They tickle me.
You must bathe and shave.
No... the food must wait!
I had faith in you!
I knew you would come home.
I was so sure... so confident!
When I'm in your arms...
I seem to melt away.
Wait, Michiko! It won't be long now.
Here I am! It's not far now.
Trails dogged my footsteps,
but it will soon be over.
Tonight I'll see you... hear you...
and feel your tender hands.
And my memories will revive all that
which we have lost.
Not far now!
Let me rest... just five minutes!
Then I'll continue on to you.
There were no 'Farewells' for us.
Michiko!
Tonight our life is starting again.
Michiko,
I'm back with you...
by your side...
The End.
