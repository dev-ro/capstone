What do you think?
You know how I'm gonna score
this part? For an oboe.
- Play it against your horn.
- Well, how about it?
It'll lighten up the melody
and give it a nice effect.
- Eddie, now, what do you think?
- It's good, man.
Just good, huh?
That's better than bad.
But you don't think it's
good enough to show?
- I didn't say that.
- Well, you said the melody was heavy.
- I didn't say that either.
- Eddie, I heard what you said.
You said you had to score it for an
oboe because the melody was too heavy.
Man, we been at this too long.
We both need some shuteye.
- If you don't like it, why don't you say so?
- I said I liked it.
- Yeah, I heard the way you said it.
- What do you want me to say? It's great?
All right, you're Gershwin,
you're Ravel and Debussy.
- What's wrong with that?
- Look, you're Ram Bowen.
You write a piece of music, I listen
to it, and that's what it says.
Ram Bowen, all by itself. Now,
what more than that do you want?
Besides, what's my opinion, man?
A court of law?
I don't want an oboe playing that melody.
What do you think of that, man?
I think you're tired,
you've been up all night.
I'm not gonna give that
melody to an oboe...
So give it to a tuba.
- Because it's so heavy.
- Get off my back, Ram.
Look, I need sleep, man.
I give up my nights.
No sleep, no dames, no nothing.
I sit here, morning after morning,
arranging your music, eh?
- What do you want, a medal?
- I ought to walk. I ought to just walk.
- Why don't you just walk?
- All right.
Ram?
Will you be here for dinner?
- I don't know.
- I bought a chicken.
I said I don't know.
When you clear the decks, you
really clear them, don't you?
- Eddie!
- What's bugging you, Ram?
I don't know.
I like the music, man.
I like it fine.
Sounded very good.
Yeah, Eddie thought so, too.
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.
What are you gonna do?
You gonna stew the chicken?
Well...
Why don't you cook
it the other way?
So we can have it cold later,
with some of that cold white wine?
You should get some sleep.
I'll sleep later.
You're really gonna
stew that chicken?
- Yes. And it takes a long time.
- So do it later.
- I have other things to do.
- So do them later.
- Why?
- Do you need a reason?
You need a reason, not I.
Why do you need me today?
Because you feel you're wonderful,
or because you feel you
are worth nothing?
- Well, what do you care?
- I care.
Well, you get what you want.
You think that's all I want?
No, I think you want what I want.
- Don't be so sure.
- No?
No, no, no, monsieur.
S'il vous plaît. Leave
my baggage here.
- Leave it here.
- Excuse me.
- Do you speak English?
- Yeah. You need some help?
Oh, do I need some help. My girlfriend
is off chasing another porter
because he took her
bags and left...
Yeah, well, they'll do that. You...
- You want to wait for her here, is that it?
- Yes, please.
Can you explain to him
that I want to leave my...
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I think I can manage by myself.
- Is your friend as pretty as you are?
- Yes.
She's a white girl.
She might be hard to find.
All these white girls look alike.
Connie. Connie. I got a taxi. Come
on, give the man your bags, quick.
What took you so long?
Thank you.
- The black one?
- Yes, please.
He's nice.
Ram Bowen. How are you, man?
- How are you, Chic?
- Everything is peaches.
Say, Wild Man's still
down there, isn't he?
Yes, he's back there holding court.
I'll be down to see you at your joint.
- Oh, you're Ram Bowen?
- Yes, ma'am.
I've heard you on records.
Were you on the boat?
- No, I live here in Paris.
- Oh, I see.
My friend and I were on the boat.
That's why I asked.
We're here on our vacation.
We decided we'd come this time of
year, because it's cheaper, you know?
Lillian, we'd better get
started for the hotel.
All right.
You want to hear me
play some night,
just tell the cab driver
"Marie's Cave," okay?
Ram! Ram Bowen.
- How are you?
- Knew you'd come and meet the Wild Man.
- How are you there, Wild Man?
- Let me look at you.
You're looking great,
boy, real great.
Younger than me. This
town agrees with you.
- What is it, the chicks or the wine?
- Oh, it's both, man.
I hear you've taken
the town right over.
They tell me I gotta blow
real loud to put you down.
Oh, yeah, sure.
People's talking about your
playing, Ram. Nice, real nice.
Be up there one night and
blow you out of the joint.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Hey, I got a favor to
ask you, Wild Man.
What's this?
You writing music?
It ain't relaxing to write
it, man, only to play it.
Let's see what you got here.
I don't see why we can't
go and hear him tonight.
- We haven't got any engagements.
- We came to see Paris.
Do you want to start by
sitting in a night club
as though we're still
in the States?
I guess you're right.
Besides, Lillian, I know
these jazz musicians.
If we go tonight, he's
gonna think we're eager.
I suppose so. You know something?
- What?
- I am eager.
- Okay, you guys...
- What happened with Wild Man?
- He's giving it to René Bernard.
- René Bernard?
Where's the Gypsy?
Where is he?
The pusher does not want to wait
until tomorrow when I get paid.
- Where? In the alley?
- Yes.
Ram.
- He uses two decks, right?
- Four.
Four?
- Okay.
- For you, it cost more.
Less for Gypsy. Friend.
You never had a friend.
- Ram!
- Later.
Oh, Eddie, has it
started down there yet?
- Yeah. We had a few sets.
- Okay.
So, you think it's all right for two
girls to go out to a nightclub alone?
Of course, this is Paris.
Anything is all right.
- Besides. I want to see Ram Bowen.
- You've come to the right place.
You in the band?
Come on, I'll take you down.
Thank you.
- You girls know the Ram?
- Not really.
Well, he tried to pick her
up in the train station.
She knows him, all right.
I want a good table for the ladies.
I gotta go to work. I'll
see you in a few minutes.
That sure is a cute little devil you tried
to pick up in the station today, big daddy.
Tried? Looks like I have.
Come on, man, let's play.
Mood Indigo.
See you.
Well, how about something to eat?
- Could we go to Les Halles?
- Yeah.
- We can and we will.
- Let's walk there.
Say, are you gonna take off
without saying goodbye?
- I didn't even get a hello from you.
- Lillian Corning.
- Ram Bowen.
- Hello.
- How are you? What's your name, honey?
- I thought you...
Connie Lampson.
You thought what?
I thought you knew.
No. You thought you were gonna
run off with her, right?
Why don't we cut out, huh?
I thought we'd all go and
have some breakfast.
Together.
Well, I think we'll have a
little breakfast alone.
I think we'd better be getting
back to the hotel, Lillian.
What, are you kidding? I mean,
you went to all the trouble
to find out where I was playing and then
you stuck it out until closing time.
Wait a minute.
That wasn't her, that was me.
She didn't even wanna
come and I insisted.
And then she wanted to go home.
So please, don't talk like that.
Why are you apologizing
for his rudeness?
Ram...
Yeah, I'd better get lost.
- Oh, no, come on. Go with us, please?
- Oh, what's the matter, kid?
Somebody forget it was your
birthday or something?
What do you want me to do, apologize?
All right, I apologize. I apologize.
No, I'm sorry.
I really am. Okay?
Okay?
Now, why don't you go
on with your friends?
Because I'm not in a
very good mood tonight.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
I just wanted to tell you how
much your music meant to me.
- Thank you very much.
- I'm sure you hear that all the time.
No, actually, you never
hear that enough.
You'd better go on
with your friends.
I can't. They went already.
Kid, you don't want
me for what you want.
Now, in the States, when you
got nothing to do, maybe.
But in Paris, I'd just be a
waste of a good vacation.
There are companies that
take care of tourists.
You know, I'm not
the Travelers Aid.
Well, I'm not looking for any help,
so you don't have to worry about me.
I'll tell you the truth, honey.
I worry about me, not you.
Honestly, you're in
no danger from me.
That phrase does not exist
coming from a female,
especially a female on
a two-week vacation.
It's like a job I had
when I was a kid in camp.
Boy, the dames just
came up like sharks.
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Hey, wait a minute.
Are you tired?
- But don't you need to sleep?
- No, I...
I like to walk. And I
like the way you walk.
And Paris is a city to walk in.
- It's a beautiful city.
- Yeah.
It takes more than two
weeks to see it, though.
- Can't you stretch your time a little?
- No, I have to go back to school.
- You go to school?
- I'll start teaching next term.
- What's that?
- Notre Dame.
- You didn't even look.
- Well, I didn't think they'd moved it.
I guess you've pointed it out
to lots of girls from here.
One or two. Maybe three.
- Well, it's lovely.
- So are you.
And I've never said that
to any of them before.
Well, not more than one of them.
Not more than one on this bridge.
You know, if I had a teacher
like you when I went to school,
boy, I would've learned something.
- I think you've learned enough.
- Not in school.
You said something about
buying me some onion soup.
It won't run away.
No, but I might.
You might run from here?
The garden spot of the
Western world? You might run?
Look at it.
Look.
And not just what you see, but the
way the place makes you feel.
I'll never forget the first day I
walked down Avenue Champs Élysées.
Just like that, I knew
I was here to stay.
How long have you
been away from home?
- Five years.
- You've never wanted to go back?
No!
You stick around Paris for
a while and stretch a bit.
Sit down for lunch somewhere
without getting clubbed for it
and you'll wake up one day, look
across the ocean and you'll say,
"Who needs it?"
Who needs it?
Well, we certainly don't need to sit
down for lunch and get clubbed for it.
- Amen.
- But we do need our roots, don't we?
And where our roots are, our
home is. Wouldn't you say?
I would say that you're one of them
socially conscious chicks, right?
Home, to me, is home.
And my family is my family.
And whatever problems they've
got, I've got them, too.
Of all the beautiful girls who
come to Paris every year,
I get a swinger for the cause.
Well, I can't fight you
on an empty stomach.
Besides, we've just met,
so I think I'd better take you
and buy you that onion soup.
I think you'd better.
It really is like every painting
of Paris I've ever seen.
It's beautiful.
- You like this all the time?
- Like what?
I don't know. In my league,
the guy usually makes the pitch.
You not only pitch, you pick
up the bat and hit for one.
- You come on like this with all the guys?
- No. Only with the special ones.
How many of those have you met?
One. Yesterday.
Yeah, but you were probably
pretty ripe for him.
Two weeks in Paris on the loose. That's
why you thought he was so special.
No. I don't know.
I watched all those people last
night while he was playing.
They thought he was
pretty special, too.
- Yep, plays a good horn.
- Yep, plays a good horn.
It's much more than that.
It's the way he feels when he plays
it, and the way he made me feel.
That's why I may have been ripe,
but not just for anybody.
Do you know anything about music?
I've got a friend who says he
knows everything about music,
except what he likes,
and I'm the opposite.
What's Paris Blues?
Hey, you'd better get dressed.
Do you write music, too?
Honey, I live music. Morning,
noon, the whole night.
Everything else is just
icing on the cake. You dig?
- I dig.
- And I...
I got no time, no serious time,
for anything else. I laugh it up.
- You don't have to explain.
- No, for your own good.
I mean, you don't want to take
a chance on a guy who won't...
You know something?
Everybody is always waiting for
everybody else to take a chance,
because they're so afraid.
Me, I'm more afraid of not taking a
chance than taking it and getting...
Well, you can get kicked
in the teeth that way.
My brother's a dentist.
What do you do with yourself?
Back home, I mean.
Small town, small job, small life.
- What do you do, collect dolls?
- No.
Those are for the kids.
My kids. I have two children.
- This a picture of them?
- Yes.
That's crazy, man.
You know, the big
one looks like you.
Thank you.
Now, aren't you interested in
knowing whether or not I'm married?
None of my business.
Well, I'm not. I mean,
I was, but I'm not now.
- So you're not.
- Well, don't look so disappointed.
What kind of guy was your husband?
He was a nice guy.
- Very sweet, and very kind.
- What happened?
What happens?
Kids and I get along fine.
We live in a big old
house with lots of room.
The kids have friends
and I have friends.
- Boyfriends?
- All kinds.
And you dig it, huh?
- I mean, that small town jazz.
- Yes.
Here's your picture.
Yep.
I'm acquainted with those houses.
- You know why it's so quiet?
- Why?
Because everybody's dead
inside those houses.
The quiet of the grave.
When it's quiet in my house, it
simply means the children are asleep.
Look, you like the
life, you live it.
You know, you're not dressed yet.
Guess Eddie's still out
with that friend of yours.
I think they liked each other.
Well, we gotta work this afternoon.
- You'd better go back to the hotel.
- All right.
Suppose your friend's not
there when you get back.
- I'll take a walk.
- By yourself? You'll get lost.
I have a map.
Hey, wait a minute.
Why don't you stay here,
at least until I get
in touch with Eddie?
You just do anything
I say, don't you?
- Well, I want to stay.
- You're a nut.
Well, I ain't getting
involved with no nut.
You missed lunch.
I made the chicken
the way you like it.
- Couldn't make it, I got snarled up.
- We can have it cold tonight.
- Some other night.
- You're getting snarled up again tonight?
- Could be.
- I see.
You see what?
For you, lunch and dinner with
the same woman, that's unusual.
How long is she here for?
I don't know. Couple of days.
I don't dig this.
What're you trying
to do, tie me up?
I'm trying to keep you untied.
I know what I need.
You need your work,
Ram. That's all.
And me, or someone like me.
Nothing else works
for people like us.
- We've got company, man. Remember?
- Oh, yeah.
It's only been a couple of days.
Give it a chance. Come on.
You know, no matter how cold it gets,
there's always somebody fishing.
- Do they ever catch anything?
- Yeah. Old shoes, tin cans, maybe a cold.
Oh, it's all so...
I don't know what.
- Picaresque? Charming, colorful.
- Yes. All right.
- Oh, I hope we can eat on the boat.
- You just had breakfast.
I can always eat. You wouldn't
know it, but I eat like a horse.
I'd know it.
- It shows?
- Not in public.
Not in private, either.
It's all right. I like a
girl with a little...
A little what?
I have never seen so many of them.
- They're just everywhere.
- Well, it's the City of Love, doll.
- Just not brotherly love, that's all.
- And they're out in the open, too.
The French are very practical people.
They get their fresh air at the same time.
You'd think he'd be exhausted
after working all night.
Not him. I've seen him
go like this for a week.
Ten days, just balling
it up. And then...
Somebody comes along, scoops him
up and pours him out at his house.
It's such a crazy life.
Yeah, well, that's because
you're one of the day people.
We are the night people,
and it's a whole different world.
You don't think they can mix?
Well, I don't mind them going
to public places together,
but I certainly wouldn't want
one of them to marry my sister.
Well, now, let me see.
Connie's a day person.
- You're telling me.
- And I'm a day person.
But you know something?
- I think you are.
- No.
- Well, you're not like him.
- Well, I'm taller than him.
No, you're steadier.
Don't you let him fool you.
He's as steady as a rock about the
things that are important to him.
- Like music?
- Like music.
Oh, indeed.
Sure, Eddie could get a job
with any band he likes.
- Wild Man Moore would pay him a fortune.
- But he stays with you.
He likes Paris.
He likes you, too.
I like him. But I guess
that doesn't surprise you.
- No, ma'am.
- Well, it surprised me.
I never thought I could be
interested in anybody like Eddie.
- The way he lives and the way I am.
- That's his way.
I know. But to me, that's like turning
your back on what you really are.
- I couldn't live like that.
- Look, you like him, play it cool.
You dig each other?
Let it go at that.
Oh, Ram, you make it sound
like it's some kind of a game.
But what do you do
if it's not a game?
Don't ask me, honey.
I only play games.
Come on, let's cut out.
- Home?
- Yeah, home.
They want to be
alone, too. Come on.
So, you don't mind being
called "Mr. Black Man."
Of course not. Why should I?
That's what I am, a black man.
You don't mind because
that's a French kid.
- If that were an American...
- Baby.
Do you want to have fun, or do you
want to discuss the race question?
I can't separate them. Not with you.
It's too important to me.
- It's...
- You.
Look. Here, nobody says,
"Eddie Cook, negro musician."
They say, "Eddie Cook, musician," period.
And that's all I want to be.
- And that's what you are here.
- That's what I am here. Musician, period.
- And I don't have to prove anything else.
- Like what?
Like...
Because I'm negro I'm different,
because I'm negro I'm not different.
I'm different, I'm not different...
Who cares?
Look, I don't have to prove either case.
Can you understand that?
There isn't a place on the face of the
Earth that isn't hell for somebody.
- Some race, some color, some sex.
- For me, Paris is just fine.
Eddie, you're wrong. You're wrong!
And I'm not denying what you feel,
because it wouldn't be there if
there wasn't a very good reason.
But things are much better
than they were five years ago,
and they're gonna still
be better next year.
And not because negroes
come to Paris.
But because negroes stay home,
and with millions of white people,
they work to make things better for
everybody everywhere in America.
Look, are we gonna stand here
all day discussing this jazz?
I have some shopping I'd better do.
Smokin', drinkin'
Never thinkin' of tomorrow
Nonchalant
Dancing, dining
Diamonds shining with
some man in a restaurant
And when nobody is there
You cry
You gotta get a different system,
or a different thing, Gypsy.
I'll talk to Nicole. Maybe you
can see a doctor or something.
Gypsy?
This time, I mean it.
Who are you kidding, Rammy?
The doctor'll commit me.
Well, that won't kill you
as fast as this will.
Why you care so much?
- Why do you worry whether I live or die?
- Because I worry.
You need my guitar, maybe,
to play your music.
- Yeah, maybe.
- Never have you heard a guitar like mine.
- You were the best, Michel.
- I am the best.
No, were the best.
When I heard you play the first
time, you had something.
But now, you're just
burning up in the coke.
So, I'll be the best
in the cemetery.
- Now, if you keep on this way...
- It's my way.
I'm lucky. If I die, I'll
be buried by friends.
It is so long since I come here.
Is it a bird you wish me to meet?
I wouldn't think you
like birds, Ram.
Many people fear birds.
They think of them
as a snake that fly.
But I...
I have always loved the birds.
Their songs, their flying.
When I was a little boy,
I was sure I could fly.
Do you know that many
children have this?
Like, a memory of flying.
Many children get
killed trying to fly.
Did you know that? I tried
once. From a high hill.
Very painful.
Now, I don't try to fly
anymore, except in the music.
Birds are the only free things,
and we put them in cages.
They look so sad, so starved. People
are like birds, you know, Ram?
Nicole is a wren. Marie is a
big, bold, shining starling.
And I'm the cuckoo bird, eh?
At the Café Cité Bel Abbas,
in the Arab quarter.
A new shipment.
Ask for me. Fausto.
Ram, you...
I knew him. Fausto the Moor.
The greatest of the
flamenco guitarists.
He used to play like...
Like the night itself, in Granada.
- What is he now, a pusher?
- Sure. So he can get what he needs.
- He's one year older than me. One year.
- Look at him.
- I can't.
- Go ahead, look at him.
- That's you in a year, Gypsy.
- Ram.
- One year.
- Ram!
You're gonna see a
doctor, you hear me?
I know one who'll keep his mouth
shut. But today, Gypsy, today.
Okay, Ram, I try. Whatever
you say, I'll try.
Go ahead.
No, go ahead, you've
been wanting to.
D Natural, honey.
You think that melody's heavy?
Oh, never mind.
- What time is it, anyway?
- About 11:15.
What? In the morning?
Oh, now wait, come on,
come on, come on, come on.
- Lady, this romance is doomed.
- Why?
- You get up too early.
- This is late for me.
I'm usually up with the kids.
- What is that? Coffee?
- That's what it is.
Croissants?
- It's bad enough you get up, you go out.
- And I got the newspaper. Here.
You mean, there are
other people up, too?
Whole city.
Well, what do you know?
Ram?
Can I hear the music all
the way through sometime?
Sure, I told you, soon
as it's finished.
Will it be finished by Friday?
We'll probably cut a record. Soon as
it's performed, I'll send you one.
- Will it be performed here in Paris?
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Then back home?
- Maybe.
I'm very impressed.
Here, I'll play you a little bit.
It's not really orchestrated yet.
Just Eddie and me and
a couple of the guys.
It's beautiful.
Even if you hadn't told me,
I'd know you wrote it, just from
listening to you play, and from...
From what?
From the way you are with me.
Ram...
Come on, now, slow down.
Just slow down.
- I can't. There's not much time.
- There's time enough.
Friday is so close.
We got time for a cup of coffee?
It's just that all these mornings
I've watched you sleeping
and I've cleaned the apartment
and I've made coffee,
and I haven't done that
for a man in a long time.
What do you want to do,
wrap me up and take me home?
How are you gonna declare me at
customs? A souvenir of Paris?
Ram, we could have so much.
Look, I'd do for you,
and I'd keep people away while you
were working and you could work well.
I'm sorry.
Works so well, huh?
You know how many dates I've broke
to work with Eddie since
you've been here?
I've been with you more than...
We had a good thing going.
What do you have to spoil it for?
Because I couldn't go without
telling you how I felt.
You know what you're
telling me, don't you?
You're telling me to choose.
Yes, to choose. One or
the other. You or that.
You know how long it
took me to start that?
I mean, just start it?
And that's something that I
wanted to do all my life.
I'm doing it. I got
my life all arranged.
Like I told you, I got no
time for what you want.
I want you. And I
think you want me.
Well, we gotta do exactly
what we should have done
before this thing got
started. Call it off.
You mean, not see each other?
Call the game on account
of complications.
Anyway, you know, you want to see
some more of Paris before you go.
You can't go home, people ask you...
You haven't even seen the Eiffel Tower.
- Well, you want me to get you a cab?
- No. I'd rather walk.
- I don't know what to say.
- Well, then, don't say anything.
You know me, I've always
got something to say.
Well, you know, you just picked
the wrong guy for what you want.
- Did I?
- Yeah. I'm not on the market.
I wasn't shopping.
- You ready, man?
- Yeah, I'm ready, man.
Two, three, four.
Me, baby?
Burn!
Yeah.
Yes.
I will.
Certainly.
Ram. That call was
from René Bernard.
He wants to see you tomorrow
at 3:00 in his office.
Do you hear that, Ram,
my love? You hear that?
Well. Come on, man. Wake up.
This is it. Happy time.
Hey, tomorrow night
we close the club?
Yes. Tomorrow night
we close the club.
Then I'll make a big
party for my friend.
Music, eat, wine, big party!
Congratulations.
Congratulations, Ram.
Thank you.
- I can't carry these any further.
- Okay.
We'll leave them here with a note,
saying, "Any genuine
lover can take one."
I'll keep this one.
I always knew life was good, but
I didn't know it was this good.
You wanna hear
something? I love you.
- I love you, too.
- Then I've got everything, huh?
And I didn't always know
I didn't have everything.
- Now I know what I didn't have.
- Oh, me, too, Eddie.
It's wild, isn't it?
I felt this would happen to me.
I didn't know when,
and it's nothing like I thought it would be.
It's impossible to imagine.
Yes, because it's good.
Everything is good.
Eddie?
Did anything like this
ever happen to you before?
No. And I love this city.
But I'll never be able to
walk here alone again.
Well, I don't want to ever
walk here alone again.
- You're beautiful.
- Yeah?
Yes. And you make
me feel beautiful.
I don't feel average when I'm with
you. I feel very, very special.
I'd better warn you.
I want lots of children.
Not just two or three. I want
lots and lots of children.
- Okay.
- Six children. Three boys and three girls.
And I want them all
to look like you.
All right. Then we'll
go out and get married.
Hey. There's a friend of
mine I went to school with.
He's just been ordained a
minister, in the good old USA.
Bully for him.
Connie, that was pretty sneaky.
Now, you marry a man, and you stay
where he works and lives. Right?
You marry a man and
you make a good home
for him and for your children.
Eddie, please try it. Just come
home and give us one year.
If it doesn't work like I say, we
can come back here, I promise that.
- Connie...
- Oh, Eddie, this is not your home.
This is a place you've run to.
And I don't want us running away.
I want us to go home and have a
family, face what we have to face
and change whatever
we have to change.
I don't want any favors. Yes?
I don't beg for
anything anymore, see?
Besides, you're
interested in a cause.
I'm not interested in a cause.
I'm only interested in us.
You're not interested in us.
You're interested in you.
Come on, I'll take you
back to the hotel.
No.
No, Eddie.
Connie? Hi.
I got that perfume you wanted.
Also, I got some more of
those posters for the...
Yes. Yes, that's right. I would
like to leave as soon as possible.
- Tomorrow would be fine.
- Tomorrow?
Yes. Can you confirm that for me?
Thank you. Yes,
thank you very much.
Eddie?
It's not gonna work, Lillian.
I'd better get out while
I'm still in one piece.
This is ridiculous, Connie.
What did we come to Paris for?
To be run out of town by two kooks
just because we got our feelings hurt?
Now, we're acting
like two adolescents.
- We've still got things to see.
- I wouldn't know what I was seeing.
That doesn't make any difference.
We've got two days,
and we're going to use them.
I've got the list right here.
Now, we haven't seen
the half of the Louvre.
We never did get to the
top of the Eiffel Tower,
we didn't get to the Catacombs,
we haven't finished shopping.
And how can I get my
return reservation?
The concierge will fix it.
You're not the only one who
wants to get out in one piece.
Concierge, please.
You know, I used to
look at you and Eddie
and think, "My God, how
simple it is for them."
Lillian, remember all the
places we could've gone?
We should've gone there.
- Mr. Bowen, so good of you to come.
- How do you do, sir? Pleased to meet you.
Please, have a chair.
- I have long been an admirer.
- Thank you very much.
But I know you didn't come here
just to exchange pleasantries.
No, sir, I didn't.
Mr. Bowen, I have
read this many times.
You have a genuine gift for melody.
Well, what does that
mean, Mr. Bernard?
Simply what I said. You
have a good melodic feel.
Mr. Bernard, I want to develop that theme
into a piece to be played in concert.
Now, what's the possibility?
Mr. Bowen, you are a
creative musician.
Every time you put a horn to
your mouth, you're composing.
Your improvisations
are highly personal.
They give you a stamp
as a musician.
But there is a great deal
of difference between that
and an important piece
of serious music.
In other words, you're trying to tell
me I'm just sort of a lightweight.
I don't know what you are yet,
Mr. Bowen, and neither do you.
I'm only saying that you haven't yet
given yourself a chance to find out.
Mr. Bernard, I've worked
with musicians all my life.
I know everything I can do.
Perhaps you need to do
something else now.
Paris is a great city for an
artist to work and study.
Composition, harmony,
theory, counterpoint.
Perhaps you need to change your
life for a couple of years
in order to give yourself a
chance to do what you wish.
- Well, in other words, it's no good.
- On the contrary, I like it.
But it's not good
enough to be played?
Oh, I'm certain a record company...
But nothing more than that?
It is what it is.
A jazz piece of a certain
charm and melody.
Yeah, well, Jingle
Bells is a great tune.
You can hum that the
first time you hear it.
Well, thanks for listening.
I appreciate it very much.
Mr. Bowen, what are you asking me?
- To say you are what you are not?
- No. You just told me what I am.
You have a talent.
You wish to be a serious
composer, perhaps you will be.
- And perhaps I won't.
- Perhaps you won't.
Thank you, really, very much, sir.
Yes, what is it?
Yes, what is it?
When are you leaving?
Tomorrow.
You still want me to go with you?
- What happened?
- Well, what difference does it make?
I mean, if you want me to
go with you, I'm going.
- If you don't want me...
- I want.
I'm no martyr. I want you.
- Connie, I must talk to you.
- Fine.
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hi.
Eddie!
Eddie, I'm going home tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow morning.
- But you've got three more days.
- Well, I've changed my plans.
- Without telling me?
- Eddie, I didn't dare tell you. I didn't dare.
Connie, I want you to stay here.
See, I want you to stay here with me.
Please don't ask me to do that.
I can't let you go.
Then come with me.
Connie, you know, every time...
I could belt you
for reminding me of all the things
I've tried five years to forget.
I go home with you and it'll
be hard, it'll be so hard.
You know, I'm a different man.
You see, I don't push easy anymore.
But I love you. I love you.
And if you'll be there,
I'll try. I'll try.
I'll be there.
Great. Great, great, great, great!
Ram, you... Why, you're my Ram!
How'd it go, Ram?
You know, this little chick and me,
we're gonna make it together big.
We're taking off
tomorrow for New York.
New York? I'm talking about
Bernard and the music.
Oh, yeah. You remember where you
thought that melody was heavy?
Well, you were wrong.
I mean, it was slight.
That's what the man said. "Slight."
He's a longhair and he doesn't
always know what he's talking about.
- He knows.
- You give up writing music?
I'm gonna go back and
just blow my horn.
Then I'll bring the whole bunch over
across the pond, what do you say?
Very good. Sure. We all go.
Yeah, yeah, you, me, Eddie,
the whole bunch, huh?
Sure.
Boy, we'd really make it
big over there, Eddie.
- You know they'd go crazy for Michel.
- Yep.
Hey, what's with the party?
Where's the action?
Hey, Lilly, you know that crazy
gypsy makes a crazy stew.
Moustache, would you take
her out, get her a plate?
- Yeah.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
Keep the party swinging
right to the station.
- So you're happy?
- Well, yeah.
- Why? Were you worried for me?
- Not this time. Not anymore.
You mean, nothing anymore?
Something. Not important.
Was it ever?
Perhaps. But it leaves
no mark. Like snow.
You sound sort of blue.
All colors. Like it should be.
- You leave tomorrow?
- Yeah.
It was good, Ram.
Yeah, it was good.
Come on, you cats. Let's swing
a little bit. Come on. Come on.
Moustachio, hey,
Moustachio, inside, huh?
Eddie, would you grab
your saxophone, huh?
Come on, come on, bring your
plate, bring your plate.
Now find yourself a seat
and prepare to get set.
Go on, go on, go on.
Hey, Gypsy!
Loosen up, will you, fellas?
Michel, come on.
Just a little one, baby.
A little one makes no difference.
Good for the body.
- Don't take it, Michel.
- Why?
I'm taking a little fix.
What's so bad?
Come on, give it to me.
Look, baby, it's over now.
For you, for me.
It's over.
Hey, Ram.
Let's both fly for a little while.
Get out of here.
Get out of here, Ram.
You're leaving, Ram.
Why don't you leave?
Take your girl and go!
Get out!
Get out! Take your girl and go!
Just go, Ram!
You and your girl,
both of you, get out!
Get out! Get out! Get out!
- How's Michel?
- He's all right.
Ram, I came to tell you
that I'm leaving, too.
- What? Connie?
- Yes.
It figures. She's a nice kid.
- You coming with us tomorrow?
- I can't.
I've got too many things
to settle here first,
but I'll be along in
a couple of weeks.
Well, I'm not waiting.
What I can't get into a suitcase
the Salvation Army's welcome to.
It sure won't be easy watching you all
go tomorrow on that sad old train.
Yeah.
Connie, why don't you go ahead?
Go on through.
- You come with us.
- Oh, I'll be there in a minute...
No, it's only a few minutes.
I'd better wait.
He might've forgotten the
platform or something.
But you go ahead. Go on.
Oh, Ram, I thought
you weren't coming.
You're not going with me?
Will you come over later?
I'm staying here, Lillian.
I just came to say goodbye.
- Ram...
- I can't.
Lillian, I gotta follow
through with the music.
I gotta find out how far I can go.
And I guess that means alone.
Well, vacation certainly goes
awfully fast, doesn't it,
when you're having a good time?
I wanna do something now.
I'd like to give you a
going-away present.
You may not like it,
but I don't care.
It's just this.
You're never gonna forget me.
You're gonna walk down the street
of wherever you happen to be,
you're gonna see me,
even when you know I'm not there.
Nobody in this whole world is ever
gonna be as right for you as I was
for 12 days in Paris,
in the autumn.
Because that's been
your gift to me.
