For 300 years the great plagues infested
the earth.
Diseases created from the experiments
of the alchemists.
Thinking they had discovered god's secret code for life…
… alchemists experimented
with genetic science.
they had no idea what they brought about.
but there was also a wonder.

there a new being arose.
them Nosferatu or vampire were called
firstly and them were feared.
it were no supernatural monsters.
but only a better version
of onszelf.
it were the Broeders. Thanks to their religion
and science we could persist…
… against the plagues and influences tease
which whipped Europe and the colonies.
PERFECT CREATURE
for 300 years these races
have harmoniously lived together.
Untill now.
look. On this moetje pay attention.
A genetic mutation.
we now know
that those arise by a virus.
that virus plays an unknown role
at the birth of the Broeders.
the mutation occurs still but seldom
and only at men.
strangely, he?
- Strange?
that god chooses such a humble
tool for a wonder.
the mothers come all from
the slums. Why we do not know.
this isje seventh, or not?

That was Broeder.
afterwards followed
several deformed offspring.
Maakje but no care.

up to this decisive moment.
300 years suffered, 
with these simple instruments…
… discovered alchemist
Giuseppi the Angelo…
… what we call the day
genetic science today.
he saw that the Broeders
formed a new race…
… by god sent, to serve and
protect your people.
he was waarlijk large a man.
but others, slechteriken, 
used the Angelo discovery…
… to experiment without
worrying itself for the final result.
powerful genetic

Weetje which is that?
Broeder Silus. They say

the church can apparently do what she wants.
I understand you aversion. It is political.
we thought that we could catch
Broeder Edgar themselves, but unfortunately.
there now still to talk is meaningless.
the danger is that it is confessed.

it concerns preconceptions, 
the nature of it.
if woman must you that nevertheless understand.

differently.
- Correct.
if a blanke kills
t is an assassin.
if a zwarte kills, suspected its all
zwarten. That the nature of preconceptions is.
they that differently are, 
as a group are seen.
if Broeder do something incorrect, 
its all Broeders suspected.
because we are differently.

the behavior of Broeder Edgar
is without precedent.
never Broeder have killed people.
never, in the three hundred years
of our existence. Not.
our role was protect
man lives and in score to keep.
soon he wants still a lintje.
- Broeder Edgars behavior are therefore derogatory.

I want thank you.

assassin dead
assassin thought that he was Broeder
Silus, you know professor Liepsky.
how is it with m.?
look himself but.
is that construction necessary?
he has decapitated a keeper
whereas he was anaesthetized.
he says that he will finish our
all.
he is therefore crazy.
- No, not real.
but go by.
Broeder Silus step soon
to the highest ring of the brotherhood.
he must know this.
- He has been contaminated.
I will show it.
if them tied up zat, 
she had not assassinated you.
Maarje is possible only contaminates to touch by means of
their blood. Thus we have devised that.
devised genetically.
Edgar worked with t virus
from which the Broeders arise its.
with approval of the government.
- Since when have they done that?
are there already 70 years no Broeder born.
and breed is woman never born there
. We need more Broeders.
you give hope to the world.
Latvian to believe in.
Edgar were busy. The birth
of Broeders genetically stipulate.
and successfully.
all these women
have carried Broeder.
but the virus mutated.
the meesten are now dead
and these life also not long more.
Edgar the first Broeder
are able be which dies.
but firstly its brain
will shrivel like at these women.
we must master try it.
- Has the police force policewoman, Lilly been contaminated, also?
no, she has had luck.
but sits in Edgars blood. Once and for all.

Lk have been correct.
what now do we get?
- My flat has been explained uninhabitable.
are YOU against the easing
of the prohibition on genetic research.
is he not terrible?
- A saint.
you could say that you research
can that change the world stops.
the church does not doubt
to the possibilities.
but to the aims
of those who use t.
and the fact that we know scarcely
how powerful it is.
if the influenza is eradicated, 
sicknesses belong then to the past?
sickness always belongs to nature and
part will determine of our life.
absolutely where.
Broeder Silus today will do belijdenis

a tradesman heard gegil.
Then he went look at he found this.

everything result from me.
My blood will change the world.
what means that?
a new canker in
the slum of Jamestown dominates there.
according to sources that the consequence of genetic
experimentings of the Broeders is.
Ledereen in the areaarea area
must remain within.
who tries escape
will be shot.
the queen will have to leave the city.
This is the martial law.
this zit dense.
Jamestowns slum have been concluded.
it does not sound just like children who play, 
finds you?
Lk you have seen body.
You have gestured a child.
have you run out on it?
In this isjouw race good.
why don't you assassinate me ordinary?
Lk understand, however, why he finds you nice.
but I can use you better.
to save you Silus my blood

obliged to a life
of loneliness and disavowal.
only to a life serve.
can you yourself that proposals?
this does not need.
you can change things.
- Change?
I will do that also. I will ensure
that the world becomes very differently.
does the world which
I create for us please, Silus?
Lk you have not yet had agentje.
But that comes. Fast.
you must find me only.
It is simply a game.
everything result from me.
You should think about but.
think harder.
the infectie spreads itself.
each day shares he is blood with more.
Whereas they are stuck in their own house.
he is present in the areaarea area.
I find him, however.
clear.
you look its this way clear.
just like the day datje was born.
no search comes there.
- No search?
the queen has ordered evacuate
the area around the areaarea area.
if that has happened, 
action is undertaken.
what kind of action?
Verdelging. Everything that area
will be burned. Also Edgar.
it is a necessary measure.
- And the onschuldigen who are not contaminated?
we cannot permit
that this continues.
is it that police force woman?
Be i nvloedt datje manner of to think?
our type cannot love, Silus.
But serve only.
we have done this.
we have helped this the world in.
we have their faith
too frequently ashamed. It stops.
is possibly no discussion there.
They are sacrificed so that the rest is clean.
the police force man, who Jones have told, 
the press that Edgar are the cause.
members of the highest ring doubt to
the way you have tackled this.
they give you the debt
of what which has done man.
I clear have made, 
you this will regulate.
you being silent him impose.
this is heavy tasks, 
but think of the higher aim.
and to your own future.
what moetje?
Lk want help you.
They know datje with the press has talked.
they can fall dead and you also.
you are the last which I trust.
- Why?
have seen Lk how you looked at them to
Lilly then slept.
perhaps is you, however, net alsje brother.
Perhaps weetje, however, where he is.
what dachtje of it? Weetje where he is?
have changed you.
Not of, but of.
I know you. And I recognize myself.
I probeerje to help.
coffee is ready.
your weet where I am.
Everything result from me.
do you have a plan?
the areaarea area is there.
All slums.
where are water supplies?
- There.
become the old districts to foresee
by their own welputten.
mineral sources.
for this reason it has remained within Jamestown.
It sits in water.
the water of Jamestown.
- There he sits. With Lilly.
you never come. Everything have been surrounded.
- I come, however.
go to the press and tell them of water
and what the government will do.
Alsje do these, you have been there.
What there also happens.
continue look out to me.
who done these, have Broeder?
- We.
I moetje show something.

she is now of me.
Silus, alsjeblieft.
- Is where them?
where is she, Edgar? Where?
how you finding if I
cut down it of your face would burn?
Alsje a monster would become?
what is there?
- There.
is there something wrong?
- No.
something lies precious there.
it takes along it and hou secret.
care that they do not arrive there.
I do not understand it.
- That comes, however.
that comes, however.
hurries up.
she is the first in its type.
that which has contaminated people, 
her has created.
she is a fortuitousness.
A wonder.
find, for them its.
we must go.
for me everything has changed now.
Because of Silus I see the world through new eyes.
Now I see hope and I see a child.
the first female of her kind and like
the Broeders she is a mistake of nature.
perhaps Edgar got what he wanted after all.
because eventually this child
will trurly change our world.
