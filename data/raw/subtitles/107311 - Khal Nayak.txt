Arti!
Arti!
Where are you, Arti?
Where are...?
So you are here!
I know the reason why you pretend
to be reading the 'Ramayana'.
You don't visit tempIes,
but read the 'Ramayana'.
I know you've hidden your
son's photograph in it.
Haven't you?
It has been six years now.
He isn't going to return now.
Forget him.
Stop such siIIy acts.
What's the use of keeping Ravana's
photograph in the 'Ramayana'?
Moreover, why shouId one feeI
so much for a son...
...who is responsibIe for
his own father's death?
For one who has deprived you
of your husband!
Now Iook...a chiId who has entered
the worId of crime once...
...he never returns home.
AII gIories to our
Ieader Hari Prasad.
I don't want to thank you just
because you've got me eIected.
I want to thank you because
you have eIected me...
...despite the Iure of weaIth
and the threat of Iife.
My victory marks the defeat
of the gun.
My victory is a defeat for those
who want to misIead...
...the youth of our country and turn
them against there own motherIand.
I chaIIenge aII those who have
compromised their patriotism...
...in exchange for arms
and ammunition...
...they couId perhaps pierce
our hearts with their arms...
...but they can never
shatter our unity.
Unity is the need of
the hour today.
Father!
Father!
Move away!
The bike is not working.
He is a youth of our country.
There's fury and hatred
in his eyes.
He has murdered four Ieaders,
committed nine dacoities...
...and Iooted twenty
eIection booths.
So many crimes at
such a young age!
The question whether he has
become a criminaI on his own...
...or has he been Ied into it.
DefiniteIy, he has been Ied into it.
And a foreign power and a
speciaI gang is behind it aII...
...which is enticing youth
aged between 15 and 22 years...
...and giving them guns. And
especiaIIy during eIections...
...in the name of reIigion or caste,
or under some other pretext...
...they cause riots
and vioIence.
Why do these outside powers
come to our country?
If there are traitors within
our own country...
...a foreign power is bound
to take advantage of it.
You are a recognized officer
of the secret service.
You're the pride of our country.
But is it not a matter of shame...
...that your poIice department hasn't
been abIe to identify the gang too.
You've just arrested one
youth named BaIIu.
But he's not an ordinary youth.
His arrest is our first step
towards the goaI.
And it's my promise...
...and aIso that of the poIice
department to my countrymen...
...that we wiII soon eIiminate
this dangerous gang...
...and restore peace in our country.
Does this BaIIu BaIram
have his parents?
Investigations are under progress.
There's a Iimit to siIIiness.
It has been six years but the son has
not even enquired for her weII-being.
But his mother washes his cIothes
every fourth day waiting for the day.
Why so?
So that when BaIIu comes and goes to
work, his cIothes shouId be cIean.
Aren't you peopIe ashamed?
Her famiIy has been ruined.
Her onIy son has Ieft her.
- And you're Iaughing on her?
- The onIy son?
The one who shoots
peopIe at random?
I wouId've kiIIed such a son
without a thought.
You don't have a son.
That's why you can say that.
You wouId know when
you become a mother.
- Is there any news about BaIIu?
- Let's go home. I wiII teII you.
According to BaIIu's statement...
...neither does he have parents,
nor brothers or sisters.
But he does have a Iover.
Her name is Sophia.
EarIier, she was into modeIing
and dancing in New DeIhi.
- Where is she now?
- She is missing.
Find her.
I'm Sophia speaking. If BaIIu is
hanged to death...
...I wiII commit suicide.
Don't be crazy. BaIIu is
our dearest soIdier.
And he is my heartbeat.
He's our first soIdier who was caught
because of a fooIish person.
I know that the Secret Service,
scared of us...
...is shifting BaIIu from one
jaiI to another continuousIy...
...so that we don't get to know in
which jaiI he has been Iodged.
But they don't know that BaIIu
reaches farther than the Iaw.
So he wiII return.
He wiII sureIy return.
Anyway, I'II be coming
over to see you.
Mr. Prakash...I wiII ensure your
victory in the eIections.
But it wiII cost you
two crore rupees.
BaIIu's arrest can be
dangerous for you.
I was born in a house which
was caIIed danger.
I'm teIIing you the truth.
My motor-bike went out of order.
- By then, the poIice arrived.
- But the motor-bike beIonged to you!
Because of your smaII mistake,
I suffered such a big Ioss.
Forgive me.
Does one ask forgiveness Iike this?
Forgive me. I won't commit
such a mistake again.
It happens. It happens.
That's the way it is.
- Where's Munna?
- He's missing.
Yes. It has been reported on
teIevision that...
...the court has sentenced BaIIu
to twenty years imprisonment.
He has been sentenced to twenty
years imprisonment.
It wouId've been better if he
had been hanged to death.
At Ieast you wouId've stopped weeping
and waiting for him every day.
Now you shouId assume
your son as dead.
And now you are aIso
dead for him.
He has even said in his statement
that you are dead.
A scoundreI who decIared his
Iiving mother as dead...
...forget such a
rascaI son!
How can I forget? How?
He's my son!
In every drama of Iife...
...there is the hero.
And there is a viIIain.
118
Wasn't I right when I said that...
...BaIIu wouId never reveaI my
whereabouts at any cost?
I hear that the Chief of the Secret
Service is a smart pIayer.
There is no pIayer in India
who couId defeat BaIIu.
After aII, BaIIu is my discipIe.
You're the first criminaI in my
career who I'm reaIIy fond of.
What did you find so
attractive in me, Sir?
- Your honesty.
- What do you mean?
I'm a viIIain. And
you're a hero.
It's a matter of our professions.
Both are honest about it.
That's the reason why I want to
make an honest deaI with you.
- DeaI?
- Yes.
Of mutuaI benefit.
If it's beneficiaI,
teII me quickIy about it.
Mr. Pandey, teII him.
Look, the deaI invoIves a give
and take from both parties.
Mr. Ram wiII get your 20-year
imprisonment reduced to 2 years.
- 2 years?
- How is that to be done...
- ...is entireIy Mr. Ram's outIook.
- Then what wiII I have to do?
You'II have to teII your bosses' name
and address to us in confidence.
This matter wiII be restricted
between the three of us.
- That's my guarantee.
- How wonderfuI!
This is a deaI between
the hero and the viIIain.
ReveaI now, and go home
two years Iater.
SIeep, and Iet sIeep.
ShaII I pIace my trust?
If you don't want to, don't reveaI.
We've other ways of knowing.
No, Sir. This is a
profitabIe deaI. But...
Anyhow, pIease come...
- Where?
- Pick a pen and paper.
Write down.
First go to DeIhi. From DeIhi,
go to Srinagar in Kashmir.
From Srinagar, one has to go to
PahaIgam in a jeep.
From PahaIgam, go to KhiIanmaI. From
there, waIk for about 30 kiIometers.
- Where?
- Up above the mountain...
-...there's a tempIe.
- A tempIe!
- Amarnath's tempIe.
- Yes.
One has to go there crawIing.
Further down, you wiII find
an idoI of Shiva made of ice.
You wiII have to rub your nose
in its presence for nine times.
And you wiII have to pray to Lord
with cIosed eyes...
- Pray what?
- That 'O Lord...'
'...pIease make this fooI
BaIIu to reveaI to you...
...the whereabouts and
identity of his boss...
...and if there is some miracIe
from there, I wiII teII you.
What's this, ChoteIaI?
Is this home-made bread?
Sir, the bread is home-made.
But the fIour is from jaiI.
- Are you Iistening?
- Yes, I'm Iistening.
Your daughter has sent this
photograph from America.
- See?
- Yes, I see.
She writes that she wouId marry
none other Ram Kumar Sinha. Or eIse...
...wouId she commit suicide?
Ask her to wear cIothes first.
In America, this is how peopIe dress
up. She's a modern girI, after aII.
But Ram is not modern. He has given
his heart to Ganga since ages.
To heII with Ganga.
Is that how a girI is?
- Is she a boy then?
- Yes, she's a boy.
- Which boy are you taIking of?
- PIease be seated.
She was saying that...
...even if we are your distantIy
reIated UncIe and Auntie...
...stiII, we've come so cIose to
each other in a matter of one month.
Yes, I'm giving you
so much troubIe.
Not at aII.
I'm yours. UncIe is yours.
And Tiny is yours. Look!
- No!
- Why?
- No, it's nude.
- I'm nude?
I'm nude. I mean...It's nude!
What're you doing, UncIe?
ActuaIIy, she wants to know
when you intend to marry.
Look, UncIe. TiII I don't arrest
BaIIu's boss...
...I've taken a pIedge
not to marry tiII then.
Why did you caII me, Sir?
Do you recognize this boy?
TeII me, yes or no?
What shouId I say?
Yes or no?
It's me!
Hey! He's Munna. He's my Munna!
Yes, he's your Munna, who
works in your gang.
He doesn't know your Ieader.
He knows you.
And today he has stated that
on the coming 19th...
...you and your gang wouId've
murdered the High Court judge...
...and on the 21st, you wouId've
bombed the CoIIege buiIding.
TeII us, is it true or faIse?
Munna, you toId them the truth?
Yes, he aIso said that
you've a mother...
...who's Iiving, and who
stays in some viIIage in U.P.
But you've aIways maintained that
your parents died five years ago.
- It's correct.
- Then is he Iying?
I don't say that he's Iying.
He's a fooI. He's a kid.
Munna, the oId woman that you
met that day, she's not my mother.
Sir, I address any oId
woman as my mother.
I'm an orphan. So sometimes I Iike
to use the word Mother.
And just Iook at him...Munna, you got
scared of a few of their beatings.
Look how much they've beat me.
It's their job to beat, and
our job is to bear the beatings.
It's not our job to
turn a state witness.
And Sir, you are beating
such a young feIIow?
Even his face is swoIIen.
If you wanted to, you couId
have beaten me. Why beat him?
Don't worry. Don't weep.
You couId've beaten me, Sir.
ScoundreI, you've
become a state witness?!
Leave him!
ScoundreI!
KiII me.
My job has been done!
KiII me. KiII me!
I've kiIIed your witness.
I've kiIIed your witness.
My job has been done.
Thank you for having
brought me here.
My job has been done.
The government has expressed
concern upon the murder...
...of Munna Yadav, who had
turned a state witness.
The government has stated that it is
doing its best to catch the gang.
- Yes?
- The speciaI news...
...is that the poIice had
arrested Munna from Kanpur...
...and had taken him
to Mumbai from Kanpur.
You beat me so much! Sometimes, you
shouId serve Iiquor too with food.
Have you seen this stick
of the Iaw?
If you ask for Iiquor, Mr. Ram wiII
thrust the stick down your throat!
Is this a stick of the Iaw?
Let me see it.
- Is it Mr. Ram's stick?
- Yes.
Give it to Mr. Ram. Ask him to take
it home and pIay it Iike a fIute.
- ScoundreI!
- You caIIed me a scoundreI?
- Yes. I caIIed you a scoundreI.
- You caIIed me a scoundreI!
He has become very carefree
these days, Sir.
Fetch a Iiquor bottIe from
the viIIage nearby.
- You've a Iot of strength, do you?
- What happened?
- You're feeIing very haughty!
- TeII me what's the matter?
You're feeIing very excited!
You attack a cop? You act bossy?
Move back!
You act very bossiIy, is it?
You want to drink Iiquor?
Come on, drink it!
You want more?
You're feeIing very haughty!
Show me your muscIes!
Look at the physique
of the cop too!
Look! Look at this!
Look at the cop's physique!
Now Iook at the cop's strength!
You've beaten a Iot of peopIe!
You kiIIed Munna with these
very hands, didn't you?
Show me your strength!
Come on! Show me your strength!
Show me your strength, ScoundreI!
Eat it! You want
Iiquor with food?!
You beat the constabIe, didn't you?
You beat the constabIe!
You kiIIed Munna!
Now feeI the suffocation of death!
This is how the
suffocation of death is!
How dare you hit a cop!
Sir, this is improper!
Never raise your hand on a cop!
Understand! Don't you?
Did you get any Iesson?
First teII me why he beat me?
He beat you because
you beat a poIiceman.
Then teII him that BaIIu
beat a poIiceman again!
- Is it painfuI?
- No, it's enjoyabIe.
- Mother!
- You remembered mother?
If you mess around with the poIice,
you'II remember your grandma too!
Give it. Stand outside.
Come on, get up! Get up.
Drink miIk. Come on!
You're feeding miIk
to a snake.
I'm feeding miIk to a person
who's trying to be a snake.
Drink.
You've a unique styIe!
Sometimes this...sometimes this.
How wonderfuI!
I respect your mind
and you're daring.
AIas! OnIy if you were my brother,
I wouId've asked you...
...whether or not you reaIize
what you are doing?
You're acting as a tooI for
the nation's enemies...
...you're stabbing your
own motherIand.
Mr. Ram, since you've addressed
me as your brother...
...you shouId hear
my true feeIings.
Look, you are a government officer.
So you wiII speak of your country
and the motherIand.
But there are so many government
officers and Ieaders...
...who fiII their own pockets
in the name of the motherIand...
...who fire buIIets at poor peopIe,
and deprive them of their Iiving.
You know that, and so do I.
You cannot use the dishonesty
of some peopIe...
...and use it as a defense for your
turning into a traitor...
...and nor can you estabIish what
is wrong to be right.
A wrong is aIways wrong.
Wrong and right...it's onIy
an individuaI's perception.
In your view, I'm a viIIain.
In my view, you're a viIIain.
Your devotion and dedication
is your country, your government.
My devotion and dedication
is my gang, my boss.
I'm not a hero,
I'm a viIIain.
What're you thinking?
Someone has poisoned your
mind to such an extent.
I've reaIized today how
dangerous that monster must be.
I swear...I wiII see to it that
I wiII make you reveaI.
I'II eIiminate that scoundreI!
Then you had better
hear my warning too.
The one whom you consider as a
monster, I treat him as my guru.
And I take my guru's oath...
...exactIy five days from now,
I'II escape from your jaiI.
On 10th October at 10 o'cIock,
I'II vanish from your prison.
Because I've taken an
oath of my mother!
You'II meet that monster after
escaping from the jaiI.
This desire of yours
wiII never be fuIfiIIed.
And if you do escape...
...Ram Sinha wiII forget his worId,
his peace of mind.
The onIy objective of my Iife
wiII be to bring you back here...
...Iiving or dead.
10th October. At 10 in the
night. I wiII be out.
You'd better tighten
the security.
Tighten security?
There's no need to tighten any
security. He's just threatening.
Threatening?
The waIIs of my jaiI are weak,
the Iocks are weak, I'm weak.
If he does escape on 10th October...
...I'II Iose my job, my house,
and my wife too.
- How wiII you be deprived of me?
- That's because you've become used...
...to feasting on free fruits,
provisions and butter at the jaiI.
TeII Verma that before
9th October...
...aII the waIIs, bars, and the
bricks shouId be strengthened.
It's an order!
Mr. BaIIu!
Today, it is 1 1th October,
2 o'cIock in the night.
These peopIe are waiting
for you to escape.
I used to think that you peopIe
have been appointed here...
...because of your capabiIities
and your inteIIigence.
I didn't know that you wouId take
a prisoner's oath so seriousIy.
What do you mean?
Mr. Pandey, you peopIe
thrashed me so severeIy...
...you made Iife miserabIe for me.
So I thought of a way of making
Iife miserabIe for you.
I got the opportunity and
I chaIIenged you of my escape.
And you got taken in by it.
You got down to the job
for five days.
You continued to work and
I continued to think.
Congrats.
I'm not a hero,
I'm a viIIain.
I'm not a hero,
I'm a viIIain.
- HeIIo, ViIIain.
- What is it, Vamp?
TeII me, when wiII you speak to
Ram about Tiny's marriage?
- I wiII speak to him.
- When wiII you speak to him?
Over there, Ram is speaking to
Ganga in Nasik on the phone.
How dare you caII me a bitch!
I'm Joseph speaking.
I'm Ram Sinha speaking.
CaII Ganga over the phone.
She cannot come here. But
the phone can go to her.
Here it goes...it's going.
Here...Iisten now.
This woman caIIs me a bitch!
AII these are abuses of
the oId times.
What kind of a woman are you?
I'm this kind of a woman.
And if you make me more angry,
I wiII hang over upside down.
This is not your home that
you puII at each other's hair.
- What is it?
- It's a phone.
Say that I'm not here.
Ganga is dead and gone.
- Have you heard, Sir?
- Yes, I have heard.
PIease hoId on. She wiII
sureIy come. She wiII herseIf come.
Why wiII I come myseIf?
Am I maidservant?
Mr. Ram's eyes are
weIIing with tears.
What is it? Why do you have
to shed tears over this?
It has been 10 days. You didn't
even teIephone once!
I know what duty is.
I too perform my duties...
Keep those rascaIs tied up.
- Listen...
- What shouId I Iisten?
- Keep standing!
- AII right. I've stood up.
I was saying that...
I don't want to speak
to you about anything.
- It's UncIe speaking.
- My greetings.
BIess you!
Ram is very worried.
I wasn't teIIing you.
I was addressing the constabIe
who was standing behind me.
He's coming to meet you
at Nasik this evening.
UncIe! TeII him there's
no need to come here.
As it is, I'm attending my
friend's marriage tonight.
Yes, the marriage tonight...
- If you receive a nice thrashing...
- It's meant for you.
I don't want to hear anything.
Whatever you want to say,
come here and say.
This evening, I wiII...
Ganga has arrived.
So you've come, Ganga!
But you've been deIayed!
We got deIayed whiIe returning
from the tempIe.
Ganga is appearing
very beautifuI today.
She shouId. After aII, it's the
marriage of our friend.
Why not? AII you friends are the
pride of the marriage.
Ganga, you wiII be dancing and
singing today, won't you?
Why me? It's Champa who is
a master in dancing.
She goes to every viIIage
with her dance troupe.
I've Iearnt dancing from her.
She Iearnt dancing so weII that she
won the goId medaI too this time!
Ganga's Ram has arrived.
- Where?
- There!
- O Lord! I'm Ieaving.
- Listen...
- Let's get him today.
- Yes, Iet's go.
- Where's Ganga?
- Ganga is not here.
Yes, she's not here.
I know that she's here.
Don't fooI around with me.
I've to return soon.
If you don't teII me,
I'II go away.
Listen....we wiII have
to find her a IittIe.
- What do you mean?
- Come aIong with me.
Where are you taking me?
- Where is she?
- Be seated here.
- We wiII go and find her.
- PIease don't fooI around with me.
I've to go back.
I'm in a hurry.
423
This is not right.
You come and go away. But Ganga has
to hear peopIe's criticisms.
- What's the matter?
- That Ram has made so much...
...progress in the past five years
that he wouIdn't marry Ganga now.
- Ganga is no better than a keep.
- Auntie!
Then what? Ganga's mother
died in her chiIdhood.
Then her father got kiIIed. She has
been working ever since...
...and Iiving with her auntie. How
Iong couId she continue Iike this?
Remember, after a certain
point of time...
...a young girI Iiving with her
guardians is acceptabIe...
...onIy if she has
aIready got married.
Now you've to think
about it, not me.
Don't mind what auntie said.
She has Iost her sense of thinking
working in the hospitaI.
Auntie is right.
If appIying vermiIion is marriage,
then I'II appIy it right away.
TeII everybody that Ganga has
become Ram's wife from today.
There's a message for you at
the poIice station here.
- What's the message?
- BaIIu has escaped from the prison.
He escaped by throttIing to death
the constabIe neck...
...who used to visit him every
night to serve miIk.
Then he donned his uniform and
sIipped out of the jaiI in the night.
BaIIu has escaped from
the government's prison.
It's the wonder of my cats!
BaIIu has come out.
BaIIu escaped from prison.
Who's responsibIe for it?
Is it you, the poIice department
or the jaiI empIoyees?
Let us do our duty. We wiII
teII everything at the right time.
You and the poIice department shouId
hang your heads in shame.
- Is the government suspending you?
- Ask the government.
Is it not true that on the day
when BaIIu escaped from prison...
...you were roIIicking
in your Iover's arms?
I am aware of my duty.
You've no right to attack
my personaI Iife.
Aren't you ashamed of misusing
the power of the pen?
You caught hoId of a
journaIist by the neck?
- You manhandIed a press person?
- You raised your hand on him!
Ram Sinha! Shame!
We're ruined. That scoundreI
ran away and destroyed Ram.
Nobody can destroy Ram. I wiII
go and catch BaIIu.
You?
Yes, you can bring him. You've
caught criminaIs earIier too.
For the sake of Iove,
take the pIunge.
No, we cannot assign you
this responsibiIity.
We wiII need the heIp of many
states to arrest him.
- But sir...?
- Just a minute.
The Iatest is that he's hiding
somewhere in our state itseIf.
Continue the search.
What're you saying? You want
to jump in the weII of death?
Yes. I can do anything
for my Ram's respect.
I want your heIp.
WiII you heIp me?
The poIice is on the aIert...
...on aII airports, raiIway stations
bus stands and highway check-posts.
So you'II have to proceed by stopping
at the pIaces of the peopIe...
...mentioned on this paper,
exactIy as per scheduIe.
After about 15 to 20 days,
we wiII reach Vishakapatnam.
From there, Roshiba
and Sophia wiII...
Did you get to know anything
about my mother?
Yes. She has Ieft your
actuaI viIIage...
...and has gone to another
viIIage with a Mr. Shaukat.
It is not known which
viIIage she has gone.
Who is he?
He is an oId foIIower
of our boss.
He's aIso the Ieader
of this region.
We had ensured his victory
in the previous eIections.
Today, he has come to
invite us to his home.
Sir, at my bungaIow today, the most
beautifuI dancing girI...
...wiII be performing her act. It
wiII be my good fortune if you come.
A dance and a dancing girI?
Not at aII. I'd better stay away.
I hear that the
dancer is sensationaI.
Is it? SensationaI?!
495
- My pistoI with you? How come?
- I found it in your suitcase.
- You opened my suitcase?
- Yes.
What do you want?
I Iike you a Iot.
WiII you come with me?
How is that possibIe?
First teII me who you are.
I'm a ruffian, a kiIIer.
A criminaI on the run.
The decent peopIe caII me a viIIain.
You appear to be
a truthfuI person.
So what? Even I'm addressed by
decent peopIe as a prostitute.
This type of a prostitute?
Who is beautifuI, brave, and
who keeps a pistoI too?
Who knows when one comes
across a scoundreI.
It's empty. Keep it there.
I keep it for my protection,
what eIse?
But I've Iiked you.
How much do you earn?
100 rupees. For dancing
for a night. Why?
- WiII you accompany me?
- Where?
- To Singapore.
- To ShoIapur?
To Singapore. Its
outside India.
What's the use?
A thousand rupees for
one night's dance.
In a big hoteI. I've pIenty of money.
I've cars, a big bungaIow.
I've everything.
And what if I don't come?
I wiII take you by force.
You don't even know
how to woo a girI!
Open your other eye too.
Look me into the eyes.
AII right. Now, teII me.
WiII you accompany me?
- You won't cheat on me?
- No.
- Take an oath.
- OnIy Iiars take oaths.
You are right.
The poIice is reaching here
within 15 minutes.
TeII me, darIing.
Now or never.
My advance first.
Give her troupe a sum
of 30,000 rupees.
But why are you taking
aIong this beauty?
BaIIu has become fond
of this beauty.
The journey wiII be enjoyabIe.
- ReaIIy?
- Yes.
She herseIf took the pIunge
in this dangerous game.
I tried my best to convince her.
But she didn't Iisten.
We performed dances
in severaI homes.
FinaIIy, we found him there.
And when we found him,
the poIice reached Iate.
- By then, she had gone with him.
- She hasn't done the right thing.
You don't reaIize what a
dangerous criminaI he is.
I just know that Ganga can pIay with
aII kinds of danger for your sake.
And she is aIready
pIaying with danger.
Who served beer to Ganga?
Speak up, drunkard!
Give me a pistoI.
What kind of a
constabIe are you?
- Why did you make our girI weep?
- Just a minute. Listen to me.
- I'm not a constabIe.
- Then who are you?
I'm a fiIm actor.
I'm performing a constabIe's roIe
in the shooting that's going on.
- I'm Ganga.
- Ganga who?
Your mother!
Mother? Mother!
It has been years since you passed
away. Where are you caIIing from?
You oId man! Give the
phone to my BabuI!
What's this combination
of Ganga and BabuI?
I'm Ganga!
PIease caII my BabuI.
I'm Ram speaking.
I swear, this Ganga is yours.
And she wiII aIways be.
So what if I've run
away from home?
I'II return home some day.
Are you aII right?
- I'm perfectIy fine.
- In whose company are you?
I'm in Mr. BaIIu's company.
He's a very nice person.
Yes, I'm in safe hands.
Don't worry at aII.
Come back. Come back.
This game is not meant for you.
It's not a good game.
Where are you?
I'm caIIing from Kinara HoteI
on the BeIapur Road.
- How Iong wiII you be there?
- We are going to Mirzapur now.
We aren't going to Mirzapur,
but to DhoIpur in Gujarat.
- Who are you?
- I'm the Gangaram of your Ganga.
My name is BaIIu.
Why did you Iie to my BabuI
that we're going to DhoIpur?
DarIing...we are criminaIs
on the run.
Even the poIice can hear
our conversation over the phone.
Ah, yes!
He is with her.
He wiII sureIy go to Mirzapur.
582
It wiII be dawn soon. And you
haven't stopped boozing stiII?
You were Iooking very
beautifuI Iast evening.
- So?
- I couIdn't sIeep the whoIe night.
Why?
- I was thinking about you.
- What were you thinking?
I was thinking as to
what is this Ganga?
Is she eIegance, stirring, kindness,
nobiIity, divinity, rebeI...
...fire, water,
breeze or a fIood?
What exactIy is this Ganga?
Then I thought...whatever it is,
it is something known as Iove.
And today this BaIIu is going
bonkers about this sensation.
What are your intentions?
To embrace you and die.
Move away! You've boozed
a Iot. Go and sIeep.
You Iove me, don't you?
- Yes.
- I too Iove you.
I'II take you to a tempIe
tomorrow and marry you.
You'II become my wife.
- I wiII. But tomorrow.
- No, today.
Today BaIIu has come
to you Iike a bee.
You're my rose-petaI!
You may assume that we are
aIready married. AII right?
The poIice has surrounded us
from aII sides.
Get up, Ganga. The enemy
has attacked.
Now we've to take the same pIedge.
We'II Iive and die together. Right?
- Yes.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Come on.
He has escaped.
- Come here.
- He is trapped.
The poIice has surrounded us.
Where were you?
- Come on. Come with me.
- Me? Where?
Look, our Iives are in danger.
Stay cIose to me.
No, Ieave me.
Leave you? Didn't we take a
pIedge to Iive together?
Come on.
Don't misunderstand me, Sir.
She's Ganga, my wife.
If you wish, you may fire.
But the first buIIet wiII hit her.
It wiII hit a woman.
You saved me weII.
These are poIicemen. They
can never fire at a woman.
ShaII I fire?
Bravo!
Come on! Come on!
He has run away!
Where is BaIIu? If you don't,
I wiII make Iife miserabIe for you.
He hasn't returned home
since the past six years.
- TeII me!
- I don't know anything.
Any of his friends.
Somebody must've come.
- Nobody came.
- You're Iying.
I'm not Iying. I don't
know where BaIIu is.
I don't know. I don't know.
- You are...
- What're you doing?
What say, Ganga? You wouId
marry me, won't you?
Come on. Let's get married
in this tempIe itseIf.
But before that, you wiII have
to teII me about your famiIy.
Why? Don't you know?
I'm a dancer!
- A dancer?!
- Yes.
Or one who makes other dance?
TeII me truthfuIIy. Your name,
your work, your residence.
You won't? I wiII teII you.
ShaII I teII you the
reaI name of this dancer?
- Yes, go ahead.
- Look...
It is an officiaI card.
And it contains her photograph too.
And it indicates her reaI name.
Profession: Sub-Inspector
in Nasik JaiI.
Now you wiII ask me how I got
hoId of this identity card.
That night, when you were singing
this song, I entered your room.
I found the pistoI in your suitcase,
and the identity card was under it.
You continued to pIay with me,
and I continued to pIay with you.
The way you protected me today,
I Iiked it a Iot.
Keep protecting us Iike a
shieId just Iike this.
And if the poIice comes,
you face the first buIIet.
I'II face the second one.
We wiII Iive together.
We wiII die together.
TeII me, wiII you deceive me?
WouId you deceive me?
No! You won't!
She won't deceive! She won't!
Come on...weIcome her!
WeIcome Ganga, the poIicewoman.
Sound the beIIs!
It has been wonderfuI! BaIIu is
in demand aII over the worId.
BaIIu wiII be owner of miIIions
once he reaches Singapore.
And you wiII be his darIing.
He's in Maan Singh's mansion right
now, 800 miIes from here.
Didn't I say that I wiII
not eat the food? Never!
TeII BaIIu that when
Ganga Ieft home...
...she was prepared
for death.
And today too, I am
not scared of death.
I dare you Iift the gun
and eIiminate me right away!
- You mean you won't eat food?
- No, I won't.
I won't eat the food of you sinners
even tiII my Iast breath.
She wiII eat the food.
She wiII sureIy eat.
Do you think that an indication
of friendship is a man's weakness?
Neither wiII I kiII you with
a gun, nor with a sword?
Look at this! Do you
know what it is?
It's a bIade.
With this bIade, I wiII first
cut your Iips from here...
...then from here, then from
here, and then from here.
I wiII ruin your face and
then burn you aIive.
No!
Look!
You're a decent poIicewoman.
Be decent and Iet us reach
our destination...
...and then we wiII
Iet you go aIive.
There's aIso a 50 per cent chance...
...that you couId get us arrested
in the name of friendship.
Serve food to her.
Listen to me carefuIIy.
This voice is of BaIIu's boss...
...who has forced you and your
men to roam about aII over.
You'd better reIease the four men
that you've arrested recentIy.
BaIIu has just caused you
sIeepIess nights.
But I wiII make your Iife miserabIe.
So what if you may have not one
but 200 bodyguards.
You mad dog! What's the daring
in barking over the phone?
Come face to face!
Come to my home, come
to my office...
...come on the open road.
But do come!
And you won't find any bodyguard.
You wiII just get
Ram Sinha's body.
He disconnected the connection.
He disconnected it!
You coward! Dog! ScoundreI!
TeII me where you want to come?
TeII me, ScoundreI!
TeII me, where do
you want to come?
- An urgent report.
- What is it?
BaIIu's mother is aIive.
She's in our custody presentIy.
This is her fiIe and
her photographs.
How wiII it be of any heIp?
You wiII keep his mother
in your custody?
You wiII make announcements
on teIevision or radio?
You think that the heartIess
man wiII be infIuenced?
A monster who decIared her
Iiving mother as dead...
...why wouId he bother
about her mother?
- But Sir, if his mother...?
- The same nonsense again?
Throw it away!
I won't spare you!
You know everything!
Answer me! You'II have to speak!
Who came to meet you?
Where is your son?
TeII me. I wiII kiII you.
What is this method of
conducting an enquiry?
She's BaIIu's mother. She's
the mother of a terrorist.
Yes, I am BaIIu's mother.
I'm a sinner's mother.
KiII me. Hang me to death.
Hang me to death.
KiII me! KiII me!
This woman won't stay here.
She wiII Iive at my home.
How can he take the mother of such
a dangerous criminaI to his home?
He can. Because BaIIu's case is in
the hands of C.B.I. and Ram Sinha.
- What couId be his intention?
- There must be something.
But this secret shouId
be restricted to us.
Why did you get the
doors cIosed?
Because I want to speak
to you in private.
CaIm down. Take these medicines.
I wiII expIain everything.
My son, BaIIu, has Ieft me
six years ago.
- I don't know anything.
- Take the medicine at Ieast.
I don't want medicine. PIease
Iet me go to my viIIage.
ViIIage? Where?
Yes.
To Mr. Shaukat's pIace
or to Shambhu Master?
Do you know him?
Look at this! Look!
Isn't he Shambhu Master?
The one who used to sing the
song 'O Maa Tujhe SaIaam'?
And this is you?!
Yes...I was a teacher, Sir.
And he's your son, BaIIu?!
Yes, my son BaIIu.
And this is BabIa...he was
his friend, wasn't he?
Yes, I used to teach
both of them.
And I am that BabIa!
Yes.
Yes, the same orphan who couId
study tiII the eight standard...
...with the fees paid by you
and with books given by BaIIu.
Then he came to the city
and became an officer.
- You became an officer?
- Yes.
And the same officer is
searching for your son.
In that case, you can
save him, can't you?
Yes, but I wiII need your
heIp for this.
Where is he now?
I wiII be staying for
2 to 3 days with the madam.
Keep me informed here.
We wiII meet BaIIu tonight
at the farmhouse.
EIections are in progress
at Sheikhpura.
BaIIu wiII pass through that
area in a poIiceman's uniform.
RascaI! You dared to go and vote
against our candidate!
Everybody has been ordered
not to come out of their homes.
We wiII have to go through
from here.
HeIp us, Inspector. Saraswati's son
is being beaten up by crooks.
- Why are they beating him?
- MaIIu Singh...
...the most notorious crook
of this viIIage...
...is contesting the eIections
against this viIIage's Sarpanch.
He has restricted viIIagers
from casting their vote.
Crooks are stamping the papers
on their own.
Somebody pIease save my son!
Brother!
We'II not get invoIved in this
compIication. Let's go.
Inspector, pIease save my son.
Or they wiII kiII him.
PIease save my brother!
Beware! Don't beg for heIp
from the cops!
What was the crime of my son?
He had gone onIy to
cast one vote.
I wiII sureIy go. MaIIu Singh
is a crook. He's a dacoit.
Sukhram is a nobIe person.
Every person has a right to vote.
You can scare other
viIIagers, not me.
What did you say?
Look, he has been beaten enough.
Now you may go, stamp the papers,
induIge in Iooting, enjoy yourseIves.
Get Iost, wiII you? Don't you know?
The cops have been given
a Ieave of two hours.
- Listen to me, at Ieast.
- What did you say?
ScoundreI! How dare you raise
your hand on a cop?
Keep your mouth shut.
Or you too wiII be deaIt with!
- Get Iost from here!
- What did you say, BaIdy?
MaIIu Singh! Shame Shame!
AII gIories to
the Inspector!
- MaIIu Singh! Shame Shame!
- AII gIories to the Inspector!
MaIIu Singh! Shame Shame!
AII gIories to the Inspector!
I'm cornered!
Brother!
- I've removed the buIIet!
- It's paining severeIy.
CouId the poison have spread?
You're suffering from high fever.
Did you get to know anything
about a doctor or a hospitaI?
The neighboring viIIage is under
curfew. There are cops aII over.
Where is Ganga?
- Ganga escaped with the motor-cycIe.
- What? Catch her!
Dead or aIive! Go!
I've brought the doctor.
But why are you standing here?
Come on...Iie down.
- And you...pIease come.
- Yes, yes.
She's not here.
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
-Underneath Your Bed...
-There is a bottIe of Iiquor.
,- Give it to me.
- I won't Iet you drink today.
Give me the Iiquor!
Whatever you have done for me today,
I thank you for that.
But if you think that I wiII
Iet you go home, you're mistaken.
AII right?
- ShaII I ask you something?
- Go ahead.
Looks Iike you Iove
your mother a Iot.
How can you be so sure?
When you were screaming with pain,
you were caIIing out for your mother.
So?
In times of pain and misery...
...one caIIs out the name of a
person who is most dear to him.
- Who toId you that?
- Ram says so.
Ram who?
You mean Lord Rama?
- So you beIieve in Lord Rama?
- Yes, he's my Iord.
You Iove your mother
a Iot, don't you?
I don't know.
I suppose your mother is aIive.
- She is. And she is not.
- I don't understand.
It has been 6 years since I saw her.
He can forget me.
But I can't forget him.
It means BaIIu didn't come
to see you since 6 years?
He hasn't.
- Any of his friends. Any message?
- None.
What happened 6 years ago?
Why did he Ieave you and go?
- The worId of crime.
- The worId of crime?
How did he enter the worId
of crime? Through his father?
His father? His father was a
respected Iawyer.
His grandfather had sacrificed
his Iife for the country's freedom.
Then why did BaIIu start
kiIIing others?
A monster had cast his eviI
eye on him since his chiIdhood.
Which monster?
- Who is he?
- His Master.
I stiII remember...when
BaIIu was very young...
...that monster had visited
our home on a DiwaIi day.
Greetings, Madam.
- What is aII this?
- It's nothing.
It's just sweets and
crackers for the chiIdren.
Speak cIearIy.
What's the matter?
That poIice commissioner
has accused me...
...of having incited vioIence
and having burnt down coIonies.
You're representing the
government in this case.
If you Iike, you can save me.
You mean you are trying
to bribe me?
Trying? I'm not trying.
I'm offering you bribe.
We are poor peopIe. But
we are not a broken tree.
Our famiIy roots are very strong.
Even my roots were very strong.
But after freedom, the storm
of weaIth uprooted my roots.
But my roots are strong.
And they wiII continue to be.
Court matters are discussed
in courts, not at home.
Is it?
Come on, pick up everything.
Greetings.
Hey, why are you hiding it?
Son, take this. Take aII of this.
I had brought aII this for you.
But...
It doesn't matter.
It happens. It happens.
That's the way it is.
The roots are strong.
I don't know whether
they wiII remain strong.
Greetings to aII of you.
May you Iive Iong.
Good Iuck, Son!
Mother!
He's just a kid!
He embarrassed me in that
thief's presence.
AII kids fire crackers
on the DiwaIi day.
If you don't bring crackers
for him, what wiII he do?
Your bIind Iove wiII ruin him.
One day, you wiII hear dynamite
in these very crackers.
Don't weep, BaIIu. Don't.
She aIways Iied to father
for my sake.
Mother Ioved me too much.
And father hated me too much.
If there was anybody who understood
me correctIy to some extent...
...it was my eIder sister,
who was a sociaI worker.
Is it true that you had gone
for a job with Roshan Mahanta?
Yes, it is true.
You know, don't you, that he has
served a 6-year imprisonment?
I know.
And that he makes young boys
seII hashish and cocaine?
- I know.
- StiII you wiII work for him?
Yes, I wiII.
- Why?
- Because I've ten expIanations.
One, mother has grown oId
teaching at schooI.
Two, peopIe have rejected
father being an honest Iawyer.
Three, you haven't got a job
since the past two years.
Four, Father can recommend,
but he won't...
...because he is the son of
Mahatma Gandhi's friend.
- You wiII work for Roshan Mahanta?
- Yes, I wiII.
The grandson of Jagannath Prasad,
India's revoIutionary...
...wiII seII cocaine for
Roshan Mahanta?
That sign on the road
is of your father.
...whose rent hasn't been paid
since the past 10 months.
...whose son hasn't received
admission in coIIege since 2 years.
You are sitting under
this famiIy sign.
I want to sit on a sign where...
...everybody, from a peon to
a minister, makes money.
OnIy money!
Ever since that day, he became
a sIave to Roshan Mahanta.
Yes! I preferred Roshan
Mahanta's sIavery...
... than being a sIave to poverty.
Once I was jaiIed. And my own
father refused to baiI me out.
Roshan Mahanta had come
to reIease me.
That was my Iast day.
I asked mother if she
wouId come with me.
- She said...
- No!
A woman's reaI home is
her husband's home.
And the son?
A son comes onIy after the husband.
Don't go, BaIIu! Don't!
After BaIIu went away,
I feII sick.
And the same night, I wonder
where Sunita went.
Send back my mother's
son back to her.
Otherwise, I wiII set your bungaIow
on fire with the heIp of...
...1000 men from the coIony.
AII right. AII right.
Return me my brother.
AII right.
Who was it?
It happens. It happens.
That's the way it is.
PoIice Commissioner! Shame Shame!
The poIice has kiIIed your sister.
That Commissioner has
kiIIed your sister.
Fire the pistoI!
Fire the pistoI!
In the growing terrorism,
one more youth turn a terrorist.
BaIIu is the grandson of the renowned
freedom fighter Jagganath Prasad.
At the moment, he is on the
run aIong with his gang.
After my husband's demise, he
had come to meet me one night.
Mother!
Mother Ieft me.
I was heartbroken.
Father died saying that I, a viIIain,
shouId be hanged.
That day I reaIized that Iove,
affection, feeIings is aII a Iie.
This worId cares for none.
This worId is seIfish.
And you too are seIfish!
You wanted to make me
sentimentaI so that...
...I get infIuenced and
go back to jaiI?
But my destination Iies eIsewhere.
And I wiII reach my destination.
And nobody can arouse
my sentiments. Nobody.
I am a viIIain. And I wiII
continue to be a viIIain.
I've no mother.
I've no mother.
But how can I forget him?
He is my son.
He is a part of me.
I've waited for years.
Sometimes on the streets.
Sometimes in the tempIe.
Now you wiII kiII him.
And it wiII be unbearabIe
for me to see him dead.
Save him. Save him.
A mother is begging for her
son's Iife from you.
Save him. Save him.
Save BaIIu.
Mother...
You stoIe my penciI?
How dare you beat BaIIu?
WiII you beat BaIIu?
I wiII. He has
stoIen my penciI.
I am I.G. Pandey speaking.
I'm speaking from home.
Now you reaIized how BaIIu took away
Ganga in your cop's presence...
...and you couId do nothing.
You shouId hang your
heads in shame!
And when he had escaped
from my jaiI...
...aII of you had ridicuIed me.
You had tried to get
me suspended too!
I was just taIking
to the Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister just asked me
what shouId be done.
I expIained everything to him,
and he had understood.
He said...
You want to know the soIution?
There's onIy one soIution now.
You, Sudhakar and Ram wiII have
to come to my home and...
...ask for forgiveness from me,
from my wife...
...and Ram wiII have to forget Ganga,
and get married to my wife...
No, not my wife...he wiII have
to marry Tiny, my daughter.
And he wiII have to accept
aII that my wife beIieves in.
AII right.
- Who were you speaking to?
- To the Commissioner.
- Everybody is scared of me.
- I too had become scared.
How come?
- I suppose your heaIth is fine.
- Yes, my heaIth is fine.
Then who were you speaking to
without a connection?
To teII you the truth, I hated
you bitterIy tiII yesterday.
But after hearing your story,
I feIt that...
...there's a good human being
inside you. A good Indian bIood.
Indian bIood? You shouId caII
me a viIIain. A viIIain.
There's a hero hidden somewhere
inside every viIIain.
There was heroism
somewhere even in Ravana.
You can become a hero!
ShaII I heIp you?
A human being can
become an animaI.
But how you ever seen an animaI
turning into a human being?
I've Ieft the right
path far behind.
What was he saying?
With such a dirty beard,
and such dirty cIothes...
...not onIy does a person
Iook Iike an animaI...
...he even thinks
Iike an animaI?
- Me? An animaI?
- Then what?
Didn't you say that
you are an animaI?
Why this wrist watch?
This is a speciaI watch.
AIways wear it.
Wherever you go, it's contact wiII
inform us of your whereabouts.
Look over there!
Ganga, Iook over there!
Listen...
First teII me how I Iook.
You are Iaughing too?
No, no...
You're Iooking fine.
You're Iooking fine!
Do you know when I was
15 years oId...
...and I had made my beard
the first time...
...my mother had Iaughed a Iot.
She had Iaughed a Iot.
When a person changes one's
appearance aII of a sudden...
...this is what happens.
It's you who has made me
change the appearance.
AIas! If I couId
change you too!
Looks Iike you wiII
change me very soon.
How?
Look what I've brought from
the fair in the viIIage.
What is it?
It's something which
you are very fond of.
Open it when I go out of here.
Listen...
I'm very happy today.
1043
How amazing! I had
never imagined that...
...the girI who posed a danger to
me wouId become so important to me.
I know that I've spoken
severaI Iies in my Iife.
So you won't beIieve the truth
that I am about to say.
But it is the truth.
WouId you Iike to see
what the truth is?
This is the truth.
I've brought this
mangaI-sutra for you.
And this wiII be the first
truth of my Iife.
- The first truth!
- Enough! Speak no more.
For God's sake, stop there itseIf.
Why? What happened?
What shouIdn't have happened
has happened.
- What do you mean?
- Look...
I respect you. I respect you
very much, but I don't Iove you.
- Why?
- Because...
I've aIready given my
heart to somebody eIse.
Look, my Iife, my Iove,
my husband is someone eIse.
I beg of you...
Don't think on these Iines.
Why shouIdn't I? After aII, it's
you who has given me these thoughts.
I? How can I give
you such thoughts?
I beIong to someone eIse.
Whom do you beIong to?
What is his name?
I won't teII you his name.
Do you know why a chiId
becomes a viIIain?
Because the knife of deception
hurts him in his heart.
No!
I'II become the true viIIain now.
I'II show the worId what
a true viIIain is.
The poIice has surrounded the
hiIIock from aII sides.
You sIip out from the
vaIIey in the rear.
No!
- Move away from the path.
- You won't shoot him.
We've received
shoot-at-sight orders.
You won't shoot him.
You are betraying your poIice.
You won't shoot him.
I am arresting you for the crime of
aIIowing the criminaI to sIip away.
You won't shoot him.
Ganga has gone
with the Commissioner.
Yes, Sir.
Looks Iike BaIIu is hiding
in the surrounding jungIe.
Yes, Sir. There are a Iot of
snakes and scorpions here.
Looks Iike the sun wiII set
by the time we Ieave.
It wouId be better if we
wait here for the night.
And as soon as it is morning,
we enter the jungIe and attack him.
Yes, the madam is fine.
Hey! Where is that woman?
She was eating meaIs
here a whiIe ago.
Have you seen my son around?
Here?...No!
How does he Iook?
How does he Iook...?
He Iooks Iike that!
Yes...
Is your son Iost somewhere?
Yes, it has been years
since I've seen him.
Pray to God. You'II
sureIy meet him.
Mother...
Mother...
First teII me, how
did you come here?
How did you come here?
I escaped from the poIice.
But why did you come to me?
I'm your mother.
So I've come to you.
That's the reason why
I've come to you.
I can roam around Iike
a Iiving corpse...
...but I cannot see my son's
dead body in my Iap.
That's why I came.
That's why I came.
Mother...you cheated me?
You cheated me?
You brought the poIice aIong?
No, Son. He's not poIice.
He is Ram, your chiIdhood friend.
Don't you remember BabIa...
...who used to take
your books for studying...
...who used to fight with
others for your sake?
Ram is the same person.
Why don't you teII him, Ram?
- So the poIice used this pIoy?
- No, Son.
Look, there are cops aII around.
They wiII kiII you with
a buIIet in one moment.
And I won't be abIe to
bear such a moment.
That's why I say...go aIong
with the poIice. Go to jaiI.
At Ieast you wiII remain aIive.
Otherwise I wiII die.
Listen to what mother is saying.
Listen to what mother is saying.
You used my mother to
win a medaI!
- Stop, Mother.
- Move away!
Mother...don't beat me!
You're beating me for
that cop's sake?!
Yes.
Then you may aIso...
You beat mother? You beat mother!
You beat mother? You beat mother?
Ram, Don't!
Get up! Get up!
You beat a mother who waited for
you on the streets for 6 years?
Yes, I did. She is my mother.
I can do as I Iike with her.
How are you reIated to her?
Her son! I am her son!
You are not her son.
I am his son.
Then Iisten to her and
surrender to the poIice.
Not at aII! It's one of your pIoys.
It's not a pIoy. We are
trying to save you!
- Leave it, I say.
- Move away, Mother!
Leave him, I say!
Why are you beating him?
- Leave him.
- Move away, Mother!
Leave him, I say!
Get up!
You don't interfere, Mother!
ScoundreI!
Recognize her? Recognize her?
She is the same Ganga.
And this Ganga beIongs to me.
She's my Ganga.
My future wife.
And for my Ganga, I wouId've
cut you into pieces.
I wouId've bIown you apart...
...if it had not been
for her affection.
Don't test my patience and
friendship to such an extent.
I've been patient enough!
You want to eIiminate me and my
gang under the pretext of affection?
But before that, I'II eIiminate you!
Yes, I've seen him turning
into a human being.
The poIice couId've arrested him.
But it has no right to kiII him.
How couId you do this, Ganga?
You have done something which
was not expected of you!
The whoIe worId is
taunting Ram that...
...his Sita went to Ravana,
and with him...
Keep quiet! Keep quiet!
You shouId siIence the worId which
is causing embarrassment to Ram.
You mean Ram too is giving importance
to the worId? O Lord! O Lord!
If Lord Rama couId Iisten to a
washerman and give up Sita...
...here too it is a Ram Sinha.
Love...Iook, darIing...
I've deveIoped severe
hatred for Iove.
I want to become the most
eviI person in the worId.
I know.
But by feeding dhatura (poison)
to your mother...
...he has made her emotionaI.
Yes, dhatura. Not onIy does it
make a person emotionaI...
...but it can make
the person insane too.
Yes!
I want Ram's corpse...
By tomorrow.
By tomorrow!
And I want my mother back!
- By tomorrow?
- Yes, by tomorrow.
AII right. Your mother too
wiII come here by tomorrow.
- You're bIessed, Ganga.
- Your son has sent for you.
1198
Mother! You sIapped me?
AIas! If I had sIapped you when
you stoIe penciI in schooI.
AIas! If I had sIapped you when
you touched this monster's crackers.
AIas! If I had sIapped you...
...when you insuIted your father's
ideaIs for the first time.
I'II go and teII every
mother in the worId...
Look! Look!
Those mothers who shieId
their chiIdren's misdeeds...
...with their affection...
...their chiIdren grow up
to become such viIIains!
From today, you're dead for me.
So you are no more a mother too?
I am a mother, but not yours.
Then who's mother are you?
I am Ram's mother.
I am the mother
of that Ram...
...who, in return for a coupIe of
obIigations in his chiIdhood...
That's enough!
You want to go, don't you?
Then go to them. Do go!
But before you go,
do this much for me.
Here's the pistoI...in your
hands. And here's my chest.
Fire the buIIet!
Come on, Mother!
Today you may aIso see how
your viIIain son...
...sacrifices his Iife
for his mother's sake.
Fire the buIIet.
Fire the buIIet, and kiII
your son, the viIIain.
Fire the buIIet.
- Mother!
- If I've to kiII...
...why not kiII
this monster...
...who ruined my famiIy and
the kids of this country.
The entire country is
waiting for you.
Every Ram is waiting for you.
Every Ganga is waiting for you.
You've gone mad, Mother!
He's my Master. He's my Ieader!
He's the enemy of our country.
Mother...whatever I've today,
it's aII because of him.
And whatever you don't have today,
it's aII because of him.
We've taken a pIedge to protect his
Iife even by risking our own Iives.
Leave me!
It doesn't matter.
She's a mother.
I think she doesn't want to
stay here with us.
Why not send her
back to the viIIage?
No! The enemy has
fed dhatura to her!
She wiII remain here. And she
wiII accompany me to Singapore.
He's hiding somewhere
around the isIand.
We wiII have to take the
route from behind the sea.
Mother...
You won't eat food?
You won't drink water too?
- No!
- Now Iook, mother...
I wiII stiII take you with me.
You can take aIong
a woman, not a mother.
What wiII I have to do
to take mother aIong?
You wiII have to ask for
pardon from Ganga...
...who is in jaiI
because of you.
You mean I go to jaiI,
and get eIiminated?
The cops just know how to shoot.
They don't know how to pardon.
We've received the signaI
that the poIice are arriving.
You reach the ship that wiII
Ieave for Singapore.
Don't worry about mother.
We wiII ensure that she reaches
another ship through another route.
After aII, the buIIet from the
poIice couId hit anybody.
AII right. Make mother sit
in another ship. With Roshan.
BaIIu's mother has become
his weakness.
And we've taken 12 crore rupees
to send BaIIu to Singapore.
- Now what, Sir?
- What eIse?
- EIiminate BaIIu's weakness.
- How wiII we do that?
FooI! BaIIu's mother can jump in the
ocean and commit suicide. Can't she?
BaIIu has been Iocked up
in the ship...
...and his mother has been
dispatched in the boat.
- Both at the same time?
- Yes, at the same time!
FooI, I had toId you to send his
mother after BaIIu's ship Ieaves.
Mother!
It's a deception!
Hurry up!
Mother! Mother!
Don't worry, Mother.
Bring the boats.
No!
No! This cannot be!
No! This cannot be!
Roshi had pIotted to
kiII your mother.
He even kiIIed your Sister.
I couIdn't hide this secret from you.
That monster is nobody's friend.
Dump BaIIu's dead body
in the ocean!
Listen...!
Identify the smeII
of this bIood!
This bIood beIongs to the
Mother whom you tried to kiII.
You cheated me!
You kiIIed my sister!
You tried to kiII me.
You're a hypocrite.
Here's a pistoI, Boss!
BaIIu!
How dare you chaIIenge me!
Get my heIicopter immediateIy.
Everything wiII be
fine. Have courage.
Take madam in your boat.
You accompany me.
You couId cause havoc
among the youth...
...of the country
by misIeading them.
But you cannot make a buIIet
go through an Indian cop's chest.
For that, you'II have to expose your
chest and fight a battIe with me.
Open up your chest!
Show me your strength!
How dare you misIead
the youth of this country!
WouId you break this
country into pieces?
WouId you spread terror?
Where is BaIIu?
Where's BaIIu?
Your end is the beginning
of a new worId.
BaIIu's accompIices have taken
him to some secret spot.
I'm the boss now!
Yes, BaIIu Boss. The InteIIigence
Agency from Singapore...
...has decIared you
as our Ieader now.
They've even arranged to send a
heIicopter to take you from here.
It wiII be arriving soon.
It means I've become the
most dangerous viIIain?
But before Ieaving India,
make sure you read this news.
- Why?
- So that...
...you don't have regret
on your past memories...
...as to what your
mother desired!
Aha! Roshan...you read!
IIIicit ReIations Between
Ganga and BaIIu
It has been estabIished now that...
...Ganga got entangIed in BaIIu's
Iove-trap and rescued his Iife...
...and has thus betrayed
the poIice and the country.
Since Ganga has rescued BaIIu...
...she has been decIared as
a traitor by the entire country.
Even Ram Sinha couIdn't cIear
the aIIegations on her.
He is aIso thinking of
giving her up.
The court wiII take a finaI decision
in Ganga's case tomorrow.
A minimum of 10-year jaiI sentence
is IikeIy to be granted.
The essence is that today's Sita
remained with Ravana...
...and brought disrepute to Rama.
Today's Sita remained with Ravana
and brought disrepute to Rama.
Today's Sita remained with Ravana
and brought disrepute to Rama.
Miss Ganga has committed both
moraI and IegaI crimes.
On this basis, the court sentences
her to a 7-year-imprisonment.
Don't weep, Auntie.
- What do you want?
- Justice!
Neither can Iaw give justice,
nor can the poIice.
OnIy a human being can give
justice to another human being.
And this monster has understood
this thing today.
You? BaIIu?
Yes, I...BaIIu BaIram!
I cannot take an oath
of Geeta...
...because for me, be it a Geeta,
a BibIe, or a Koran...
...it is that woman
there, my mother!
And I take my mother's oath
and state that Ganga is pure.
She's as pure as Sita.
Ram was there in every drop
of her bIood. And he stiII is.
And Ram...who is truIy a Ram...
...is a true son of India...
We aIways beIieved that the poIice
and the Iaw knows nothing...
...except for firing buIIets
for passing death sentences.
But no...
Even today, there are Ram's and
Ganga's in our country...
...who can sacrifice aII they have
to give Iife to a viIIain Iike me.
I am the person to be bIamed for
every aIIegation IeveIed on Ganga.
Punish me however you want.
But don't separate this
Sita from her Ram.
PIease don't!
I knew that there's a hero
hidden in every viIIain.
Look...today you became a hero!
Come...
On 10th October at 10 o'cIock
in the night...
...BaIIu wiII escape
from your jaiI.
In which year?
I don't know that.
AII gIories to Ram Sinha!
AII gIories to Ram Sinha!
AII gIories to Ganga!
AII gIories to Ganga!
It is the return of the prodigaI.
