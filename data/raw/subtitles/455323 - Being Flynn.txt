JONATHAN: America has produced
only three classic writers,
Mark Twain, J.D. Salinger,
and me.
I'm Jonathan Flynn.
Everything I write
is a masterpiece.
And soon, very soon,
I shall be known.
At this point of the story,
let's call it the present,
I am an upstanding citizen
of these United States.
I have a job,
a roof over my head.
I have sustenance.
Perhaps I'll let you
read my masterpiece someday.
The Button Man, also known as
The Confessions of
Christopher Cobb.
It's classic.
NICK: This isn't his story.
Well, it is,
but he is not telling it,
I am.
I'm Nick Flynn, his son,
and I am sort of
trying to be a writer.
I mean, not at
this very moment.
At this moment
I'm trying to...
Wake up.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Hey, wake up.
All my life, my father has
been manifest as an absence.
A non-presence.
A name without a body.
What if he
doesn't show up?
He's gonna show up.
How do you know?
Because if he
doesn't show up
this time,
I'm going
to kill him.
How will you find
him to kill him?
I have ways.
Can we get ice cream
if he doesn't show up?
Here is the bus.
Here he is.
JODY: No, that
is not him.
He must be
in the back.
(SNIFFLES)
What kind of ice cream
do you want to get?
Chocolate.
NICK: Some part of me knew
he would show up someday.
If I stayed in one
place long enough,
he would find me,
Iike you are taught to
do when you are lost.
But what do you do if
both of you are lost
and you both end up in
the same place, waiting?
Hey, sweetie.
Hey.
I'm exhausted.
How was your flight?
Non-stop turbulence.
Nick, what is
the ashtray doing
by the bed?
Sorry.
Lipstick?
You are a fucking asshole.
Look, you are the one
who said you didn't
see a future for us.
I wonder why?
This is yours!
This is yours.
And this is yours!
AII right.
And this is yours.
AII right.
My book.
And Yates.
Oh, more Yates.
AII right.
Wow! You are
so well-read.
AII right.
AII right!
I'II pay
for the mirror.
As soon as
I get a job.
Sorry.
For what, your
complete inadequacy
as a human being?
Yes.
(SCOFFS)
Well, you warned me.
JONATHAN: Don't
worry, you're back.
Hello.
Back in the hands of
a master storyteller.
(WOMAN SPEAKING IN SPANISH)
Yeah, yeah,
go fuck yourself.
I like kids and
small animals.
What I don't like
is queers and blacks
who try and fuck
you up the ass all
day and all night.
But more on that later.
What I am,
always have been,
is an artist.
(ROCK MUSIC BLARING)
Shut the fuck up.
Shut up. Shut up.
(MUSIC CONTINUES)
(MUSIC STOPS)
(MUSIC BLARING)
Shut the fuck up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
NICK: A friend ofa friend
knew a couple of guys
who were renting
an entire building,
a former strip joint
called "Good Times. "
Unfortunately,
the good times were
not had by all,
Iike that Harvard student
who was found
stabbed to death
in the doorway
three years before.
(SIREN WAILING)
(DOORBELL BUZZES)
IVAN: I don't know
what to tell you.
That's something you
got to figure out, man.
So, what appeals to you
about Iiving here?
Low rent.
IVAN: Yeah,
hold on one second.
Do you have a job?
Uh, no. I have
some money
saved up.
I was working as
an electrician,
but now I'm Iooking
for a new Iine of work.
IVAN: An electrician?
Can you wire
this place up to Iook
Iike a spaceship?
(WHISPERS) Ivan.
Yes.
And what field
of employment are
you interested in?
Something different,
something more meaningful.
"More meaningful,"
what does that mean?
I don't know.
Are those, Iike,
the names of strippers?
Yeah. The Iandlord's
Mafia, so he just Ieft all
this shit the way it was
when the FBI
shut him down.
RICHARD: Any family?
Stop interrogating
the guy.
I'm sorry, Ivan,
but my Iast
roommate had
his entire family
from Cambodia sleeping
in the Iiving room.
No, my mom's dead, and
my dad, I haven't heard
from in 18 years, so...
Perfect.
Done.
So, are you guys Iike...
No.
No. Okay.
So, Denise, didn't you
say they were hiring
people at your work?
They usually are.
Good. 'Cause I think Nick
here is Iooking for a job.
Give him a break, man.
Where do you work?
Harbor Street Inn.
You heard of it?
No.
It's a homeless shelter.
That sounds intense.
So are you Iike
a do-gooder?
No, I'm a do-badder,
but I work at Harbor Street.
What makes
you a do-badder?
I bet you would
Iike to know.
I would.
JONATHAN: Upon occasion,
rare occasion, but still,
I'll pick up a female fare
and we will strike
up a conversation.
WOMAN: Oh, Jonathan.
Oh, Jonathan.
(MOANING)
Jonathan.
Yeah.
Let's be a Iittle
realistic here.
AII right.
(PANTING)
Still, we are having fun,
aren't we, Buttercup?
Absolutely.
Who is this?
That is my wife and kid.
Will you Iisten
to this shit.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
You are married?
Divorced,
a Iong time ago.
Well, I had better
get you home.
I Ieft the meter running.
That'II be $240.
(LAUGHING)
Quiet!
Quiet!
I can't even
think anymore!
Excuse me.
(MUSIC CONTINUES)
Open up!
Asshole.
(CRASHING)
(INDISTINCT SCREAMING)
(CRASHING)
NICK: Hey.
Hey.
I was hoping
you'd be here.
Why is that?
Well, so I know somebody.
We don't exactly
know each other,
do we?
I guess not.
I'm not interested
in a relationship.
What?
I'm not interested
in a relationship.
Okay, I can cope.
Okay.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Phone call.
Who is it?
Your father.
Who?
Your father, who
you supposedly hadn't
seen in 18 years.
This is Nick.
JONATHAN: Is this
Nicholas Flynn?
Yes.
Nicholas,
this is your father,
Jonathan Flynn.
It is?
It is. I have a
question for you.
Do you have a truck?
A pickup truck?
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, I do.
I heard as much.
From who?
Your grandmother,
she mentioned it
a few years ago.
You do remember
your grandmother,
don't you?
I do.
Good.
Now I want you
to get in your truck
and drive over here.
I'm sorry,
you say you are
my father?
That is correct.
I was evicted
and I need you
to get over here
and help me move
my stuff, Nicholas.
How did you
get this number?
Information. Now listen
to me carefully.
I am sitting behind
a door with a shotgun.
I'm waiting for
the knob to turn.
Get over here right now.
That is an appealing offer.
You are damn right it is.
It's all yours.
You are my
sole heir, Nicholas.
I want you to
have everything.
You have a pen
or a pencil?
Because I want you to
write this address down.
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?
What are we doing here?
Thanks for coming.
Sure. Should we
just wait here?
Or do you want us...
JONATHAN: Who is it?
It's Nick. Nicholas.
Come on in,
the door is open.
Come in.
I'II be with you
in a minute.
I appreciate you
coming over, Nicholas.
We're put on this Earth
to help other people.
Yeah.
JONATHAN: We were put
on this Earth to help
other people, Nicholas.
I regret our mutual loss.
I am a born writer,
so are you.
Get this in your head
at once. I am a classic
storyteller. A great writer.
I think I want to
be a writer.
Yeah?
Dad is a writer, right?
Ha!
What makes you
think that?
It says right here.
It says, "Work on my
novel is going well.
"I shall soon
win the Nobel Prize
"for both storytelling
and poetry.
"No fear."
You know where that
Ietter was written from?
Prison.
Mmm-hmm.
Why is he in prison again?
Interstate transportation
of stolen securities.
What is that?
He cashed
forged checks.
He stole thousands
and thousands of dollars.
Do you know how much
of that we have seen?
Zero.
Zilch.
Zippo.
Nothing.
Nada.
Niente.
Have you seen my
baseball glove?
If it were up your ass,
you would know where it was.
(CHUCKLES)
(DOOR OPENING)
Well? Gonna come in?
PIeasure to see you,
Nicholas, aside from
the circumstances.
NICK: What are
the circumstances?
The circumstances are
that I had a disagreement
with my scum-sucking Iandlord.
I don't know why.
And so he decided
to bring the police
into the discussion.
So now I'm forced
to move.
Move where?
I'm considering
my options. I'm a
sought-after house guest.
You know why?
No.
Because I'm
an excellent raconteur.
But until I find
a new place,
I have to put all my
things in storage.
Hey. So I'm not
bringing the gun
in my truck.
What?
The shotgun.
Shotgun?
Uh, yeah.
You said you had
a shotgun.
A shotgun?
Who said that?
I abhor firearms.
I mean, don't get me
wrong, I can defend myself.
Let me just...
You see this?
Yes.
Anyone messes with
me when I'm driving
or walking down
the street, whatever.
Bamo! Right in the head.
It sends a Iittle message,
Iet me tell you.
I'd Iike to take
that scumbag Iandlord,
and I'd Iike to ram it
right up his ass.
This Iandlord,
this merchant,
this fucking user...
Hey, that is great.
Would you mind
putting that away?
I'd Iike to
take this and...
PIease?
...ram it up
his fucking ass,
twist it around,
pull it down,
rip out his innards and
fucking pull them out.
You get the
fucking picture.
That was my
first wife, Jody.
I know who it is.
She was my mother.
I know she was
your mother.
She was the most
beautiful woman
in the world.
She was the
Iove of my Iife.
She was the
Iight of my Iove.
I know if she was
still alive today,
we'd be together.
Such a tragic accident.
What accident?
What accident?
The accident that
cut her Iife short.
It wasn't an accident.
She Ieft a note.
Did it mention me?
No.
Ah.
Not much of a Ietter
writer, your mother.
AII right, Nicholas.
Why don't we get started.
You can just
take all this stuff
and throw it in a box.
The paintings
be careful of.
Especially this one
and that one, and
that one on the wall.
Be careful of all this stuff.
It's all valuable.
Nicholas, I want you
to have this.
This is an original
Jackson Pollock.
He was a friend.
Oh, no.
I couldn't.
No, I want you to have it.
Okay, thanks.
Are you going to
help move this stuff,
since it's yours?
I wish I could, but
I suffer from Iethal
phlebitis in both Iegs.
You be careful
with those boxes.
There's manuscripts.
Manuscripts.
Those are your friends?
I guess. Yeah.
A homosexual and
a black pothead?
Well, good Iuck to you.
Well, I have to
get to work now.
Do you mind just
Iocking the padlock
when you're finished?
Yeah. Wait.
So you drive a taxi?
Well, it's
an excellent way
of Iearning
about all different
kinds of people.
And what is
your vocation?
My vocation? Uh...
I've done Iots
of different jobs.
I always thought
you'd end up a writer,
Iike your old man.
Actually, I do write.
You know, sometimes.
I try.
Well, there is no
such thing as
trying to write.
One writes,
or one doesn't.
You have to take
every opportunity to
practice your craft.
Anyway, I know you
have inherited some
writing talent from me,
because I am
a truly great writer.
I'm going to
show you something.
I have a Ietter
from Viking Press.
You've heard of
Viking Press,
haven't you?
Yeah.
Look at this. Look
at that phrase there.
"Your book is
a virtuoso display
of personality.
"Unfortunately, its dosage
would kill hardier readers
than we have here."
"Virtuoso display,"
Viking Press.
Well, it's been
a great pleasure,
Nicholas.
Well, hey, uh...
AII right.
You need anything?
Aside from the Pollock?
No.
AII right. Well,
au revoir, then.
You're welcome.
Don't mention it.
Your father's
a nightmare.
What's that?
(LAUGHS)
It's a fucking
Jackson Pollock painting.
Jackson Pollock?
Jesus!
Hmm.
Pollock spelled
his name wrong
when he signed it.
NICK: So then he
gives me a gift,
a Jackson Pollock painting.
Which, Iike an asshole,
I think is real.
So after 18 years
ofwondering,
here's what I Iearned
about my father.
He's a racist,
he's a homophobe,
and he's fucking crazy.
Can you reach him?
I mean, if you wanted to?
I don't know
that I ever want to
see him again. Really.
I don't know how
I feel about it.
I can't really
Iocate what I feel.
Is that why you
called me?
To help you Iocate
your feelings?
Do you want to
get out of here?
You Iook beautiful.
None of that.
We're friends now.
We're friends?
Yeah.
I mean, don't get
me wrong, I enjoyed
sleeping with you, but...
Thank you.
I told you I didn't
want a relationship.
So, now we're friends.
Okay. Well, thanks
for Ietting me know.
You're welcome.
You should think about
working at Harbor Street.
Why?
Well, I was in kind
of a fucked state,
mentally, when
I started there.
Um, yeah, just,
I Iike working there.
Tell me about
your fucked state.
Do you want another
one of these?
AII right?
Hey, how are you?
How's it going?
How did you hear
about this job?
A friend of mine,
Denise, works here.
Okay.
So what makes you want to
work with the homeless?
I don't know. Uh...
I mean, we are put
on this Earth to help
other people, right?
Someone I knew
told me that.
Who?
Who? No one. Uh...
Look, I guess I just
see homeless people
everywhere.
It seems Iike there
is more and more.
Seems Iike it.
I guess I just want
a job that, you know,
means something.
Something where I don't
despise myself when
I come home from work.
So you despise yourself?
I don't know.
Uh, sure.
Doesn't everyone?
I don't despise myself.
I used to be
a guest here.
Then I worked here.
I had a permanent bed.
And then I moved out.
I got a job in construction,
became the foreman.
Then one day I
came back here to
give something back.
So I've come
a Iong way up,
but it's a quick
fall down.
So I really can't
afford to hate myself.
You know what
I'm talking about?
You don't know what
I'm talking about.
But that's okay.
Tell you what.
I can put you on
the fill-in Iist.
If we need somebody
to fill in, we'II call.
Thanks.
Hey, so why do they
call you Captain?
Because I'm the Captain.
Okay.
IVAN: Just bring it
by right now.
Okay, Iater.
Hey, they called
from Harbor Street Inn.
They want you to
fill in tonight.
Tonight?
NICK: There were
different types of people
who worked there.
There were
the religious types.
I want to Iive my Iife
the way Christ does.
AIso, I hate
my rich parents.
Hey, guys, can you
bring those over here?
There were the punks.
Check in, sir, and
we are gonna get
you to the clinic.
This place is hardcore.
PIus, the pay is
not bad. Next.
There were the ex-cons.
AII right, next.
So this dude was
gonna shoot me, right?
So, I turned sideways,
'cause that is what you do.
You turn sideways,
you take it in the arm.
I flex my bicep,
I take the bullet.
And then I grabbed
the gun from this guy, and
I'm Iike bam-bam-bam-bam.
Right in his fucking
head, then it's Iike
click-click-click.
Let me tell you,
I had to disappear
for a while after that.
AII right, put
your arms up.
Joy was an ex-cokehead
and a prostitute.
JOY: There you go, honey.
Now, she's like
a mother to the guys.
Unfortunately,
in a couple of years,
she will be sitting in a room
with a shotgun across her lap,
back to dealing and
smoking crack 24/7.
It's hard to stay changed.
I start out working
inside the cage handing
out bed tickets,
collecting people's valuables
and locking them up overnight.
It's Friday, payday.
A lot of the guests
have jobs.
There is more money to
slip into the envelopes.
Let's go.
Hey!
The air is thick,
stale, smells like sweat.
Back off.
Friday, the drunks
are more boisterous.
MAN 1 : Move up, old man!
MAN 2: Why you always got
to be touching me?
Because you are
standing still,
that's why.
Every single day,
I get in Iine, and
you're right up my ass.
(ARGUING INDISTINCTLY)
Maybe I should help.
Yeah, maybe not.
Not yet.
(CONTINUES ARGUING)
There is a balance between
escalating and defusing.
Knowing when to step in,
and when to back off.
Hey, buddy,
calm down!
Oh, shit.
I don't know
that balance yet.
Well? Are you able to
Iocate your feelings now?
Yeah, this fucking hurts.
You are going to
have a good shiner.
You didn't tell me
this place was
such a rush.
It's addictive.
Watch out, or
you will never Ieave.
So, how many of
these people get
back on their feet?
I couldn't tell you.
But what I do know
is a year from now,
100-150 of the guys
who come through
here will be dead.
We catch them
on the way down.
Next stop, the morgue.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
(CHUCKLING)
Hey. Steady Ray, as ever.
Jonathan, how are you?
So, I thought I might
stay over tonight.
I find myself
momentarily between places.
The thing is,
CIaire's mom is here.
She's staying with us.
That is okay.
I'II sleep on the couch.
No, that is where
she's staying.
We are renovating
the guest room.
Tell her to get the fuck off
and Iet me sleep with her.
Is she nice?
Yeah. You met her?
(SINGING)
Mother-in-law, mother-in-law
Mother-in-law
Hey, honey!
Shh.
I mean, this wasn't
because of the old
burning-of-the-Christmas-tree
thing, was it?
No. That's ancient history.
Exactly, because it was
really funny. You got
to admit, it was.
Yeah. That was
a Iot of fun.
Sure, all right. Well,
okay, give CIaire de
Lune my Iove.
And I'm going to try Dugan.
He is always begging
me to come over
and provide some
free entertainment for
him and his
miserable missus.
Dugan moved to FIorida.
He did? Moved to FIorida?
Why the hell would he do that?
I don't know,
the weather.
Oh, the weather.
Okay, Iooks Iike I'm going to
head to my suite at the Ritz.
I'm sorry.
Okay, Ray.
Good night.
AII right. Good night.
Take care.
Give the Iovely
missus my Iove.
Don't forget to write.
Yeah, I'II write.
In jail.
(CHUCKLES)
CLAIRE: Ray?
I'm coming.
JONATHAN: For the
next few weeks I lived
out of my cab.
Renting it 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.
It's a wonderful life.
You shit at
the bus station,
you shower at the Y.
But it's not all
fun and games.
Cabbies get shot in
the head every night.
Bamo! Right in the jugular.
Right in the fucking jugular.
I'II ram it down their
throat and rip their
insides right out.
Hurry up!
(THUDDING)
(SIREN BLARING)
The police said I hitsomeone,
orsome fucking thing.
What can I say to that?
Now, I have no license,
no cab, no place to sleep.
Perhaps I'll start a new book,
Memoirs of a Moron!
Memoirs of a fucking moron.
Memoirs of a fucking moron.
NICK: After the cage,
I work housing.
It's more intense.
You are not protected
behind steel mesh.
Okay, grab a cup,
have a good shower.
Hey, I'II meet
you in the hot room
in 10 minutes.
Okay. If I'm
not there,
just take your clothes off
and start without me.
Okay.
The hot room smells
of superheated sweat,
quick fermented.
Excuse me.
I need a new
pair of pants.
No problem.
I'II be right back.
Hey, how do I know
what size he wears?
You ask him.
At Harbor Street
you write up every day's
events in the log,
and you read off
your entry that night.
He's not gonna bite.
I take that opportunity
to practice.
"9: 10, Isaac CIegg
fell out of bed, and
the bed fell on him.
"The skin of a drunk
splits open easily,
"their blood flows
more freely, thinned
out by the booze.
"The nurse is
gone for the evening
"and Isaac is Ioath
to go to the hospital.
"I make an attempt
to bandage him. "
I'm just gonna wrap
this around you.
You okay?
"9:30, I was able
to convince George D.
"to sit still for his
monthly de-Iousing."
My beloved family,
they beheaded me,
their beloved Queen.
I Ioved them.
They were my friends.
"Lice thrive so well
on George's body
"that they can be seen
crawling over him
at 20 paces."
I would never hurt them.
I would never kill them.
Hey, it's okay, man.
I understand, George.
But, I mean, they beheaded
you, didn't they? So why not?
This is the right
decision, George.
"Nothing in the shelter
makes me understand
my purpose more
"than to kill bugs off of
a homeless man's flesh..."
Okay. AII right.
Let's get you cleaned up.
"...to dress him well
in donated,
cast-off clothes,
"and to see him the next
day Iaughing beside
a burning barrel."
Okay, Nick.
Very expressive.
I Iike the stuff about
Isaac being Ioath to go
to the hospital.
Thank you.
How about we Iet
the next person
read their entry?
"10:00 p.m.,
fight broke out
in reading area.
"10:30, Wally G. caught
smoking in bed."
Which I confiscated,
by the way.
Lucky number 41.
Hey, what are you
up to after work?
Nothing.
Thank you.
I thought we
were just friends.
DENISE: Shut up.
What's all this?
Just old Ietters.
Is this from
your father?
He was in jail?
He passed forged checks
in between writing
the great American novel.
Nice.
Are these all
from your dad?
Yeah.
There's Iike
a hundred Ietters
in here.
This yours?
Don't read that.
"Loaded, I say.
"Wasted, Iooped, Iit,
off my ass, befuddled,
reeling, tanked,
"punch-drunk, mean drunk,
maintenance drunk,
"sloppy drunk,
happy drunk, weepy drunk,
blind drunk, dead drunk,
"serious drinker,
hard drinker."
What is this?
Nothing.
Some poetry.
It's shit.
"Polluted, blitzed,
shattered, zonked,
"ossified, annihilated,
fossilized,
"stinko, blotto, Iegless,
smashed, soaked,
"screwed, blasted,
"hammered, tore up, ripped up,
ripped, destroyed."
Cheerful stuff.
No one will ever read it.
I just did.
Come back to bed.
What will you
give me if I do?
JONATHAN:
Dear Mr. President.
The proper study
of mankind is man.
Ortega y Gasset defined
genius as the ability to
invent one's occupation.
I am a writer,
a poet, a storyteller.
WOMAN: (OVER INTERCOM)
The library will be closing
in 10 minutes.
The library will be
closing in 10 minutes.
If the present
holds any promise
of the years ahead,
the United States
can look forward to
many generations of
executives unable to
spell their names correctly.
Yours, as ever,
Jonathan R. Flynn.
Give me that.
That's my personal
property, you ape.
Thank you.
Tonight, I'm doing
a little after-hours banking.
I'm depositing
a check for $750,000,
an advance for my
novel The Button Man.
It's classic.
They're making a movie,
a movie of my Iife.
Excuse me?
They're making a movie.
Someone, behind the wall.
They are?
Who in Iiving hell
would want to make a
movie about your Iife?
That would be one
boring, redundant,
piece of shit movie.
Here you go.
You have to take
it outside, Eric.
Oh, what a pleasant
surprise. Thank you.
You're welcome.
Dawn of a new day.
I Iike that.
I'm going to write
a poem about you, Dawn.
You are too sweet.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Dawn. Sawn...
(MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY)
(GRUNTING)
NICK: He's seen this before.
Bums sprawled out
from drinking.
But he has never actually
stood over the blowers,
Iet the hot air
seep into his clothes.
The air is sucked
out of the library.
Even on the coldest nights
there is too much heat inside.
It's another prison,
these blowers.
Because once you have landed,
you can't leave.
Because one step off
the blower is cold,
hypothermia cold,
now that you are
sodden with steam.
The blower is
a room of heat
with no walls.
My father is an invisible
man, in an invisible room,
in the invisible city.
Whoo!
I really appreciate
the help, sir.
Call me Carlos.
Okay. Carlos.
So, Jerry, how many nights
have you been homeless?
Just one night.
One bad night
with the wife, boy.
That is all it takes,
one bad night.
You got that right.
What is up, Nick?
MAN: For the new guys,
no bottles or weapons, okay?
AII right, you're good.
Stretch your arms out
for me, sir. PIease?
Thank you.
AII right.
Step up.
I'd Iike a room
for the evening.
You want a bed?
That'II do for now.
Well, this is
a pleasant surprise.
So, you're
employed here now?
Yes, I'm employed here.
Well, I approve.
We are put on this Earth
to help other people.
You must be gathering
some excellent material.
MAN: Hey. You giving
out tickets, or what?
Many thanks.
And if a private room
does open up,
I'd be grateful.
Hey, what's up?
My father is here.
What?
My father, he's here.
He's staying here,
he is a guest tonight.
Jesus.
CARLOS: Oh, shit.
Your dad is sleeping here.
Your own father.
Nick, man, you are
the unluckiest guy I know.
Thanks, Carlos. Just
keep it to yourself,
man. PIease?
No worries.
Hey, Nick. You feel
Iike going home tonight?
No. Why?
Because your
father is here.
So you heard
about that.
Yeah.
Who else knows?
We are with you, man.
Fucking Carlos.
Maybe you could take
the night off. You know,
I can get a fill-in.
No.
It's my job.
I work here.
Let's go.
Come with me.
Bottom bunk.
JONATHAN: Nicholas.
Interesting view.
I thought you
were staying at
a friend's place?
A couple of things
fell through.
I was bunking in
my cab for a while,
but that is no
Ionger possible.
So I have been
sleeping alfresco.
AIfresco?
You mean outside?
For how Iong?
Three weeks or so.
Don't Iook so grave.
This is a great
opportunity for me.
What opportunity?
The opportunity
to freeze to death?
The opportunity to see
how the other half Iives.
The poor, the downtrodden.
I'm doing the same
thing here as you are,
gathering material.
No, I'm not
gathering material.
This is my Iife.
Life is gathering material.
I Iike that. Help me
remember that.
They won't even Iet
me bring a goddamned
pen up here.
Can't you do
anything about that?
No.
Don't you have any
clout around here?
Sorry.
Well, anyway, my writing is
going extremely well,
by the by.
I'm already almost done with
my revisions to Chapter 37.
Perhaps I'II Iet
you read it someday.
It's classic.
Okay, Iook,
you can't stay here.
Why not?
Because I work here.
Well, don't worry.
This is only a very
temporary situation.
I don't want to disrupt
your Iife in the Ieast.
I have a friend of mine
who's begging me to
move down to FIorida.
He has a guest house
and a job there for me.
Okay. FIorida,
that sounds great.
In the meantime,
this is an excellent
opportunity for
you and I to make
up for Iost time.
Destiny has
brought us together
for one fleeting moment.
Let us not spit
in its eye.
IVAN: Thank you
again, man.
And you know,
Iet me know if that
shit don't work out.
Let me know, all right?
MAN: Okay.
We'II see you.
AII right.
I mean, you could ask him
to stay here for a few days.
No, he can't.
I don't even know if
the FIorida thing is real.
I hope so,
for your sake.
Just weed, right?
Excuse me?
You're only
selling weed, right?
Yeah, just weed.
I'm just saying,
he's your father.
Uh...
I've had father figures.
AII right, Nick! Keep
your eye on the ball.
They were all burned up.
It's amazing what
can happen to the
human body, Nick.
Hey! What the hell
are you showing him?
Hey, sweetie.
What the fuck, Travis?
Pick that up! Come on,
I want to talk to you.
I thought he
was a Iittle young
to be driving a car.
You could have killed
yourself. Get inside!
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Have a good day.
You, too.
My mom had a Iot of
different boyfriends,
growing up.
Come on, buddy.
Good job.
But I never had a father.
Luckily, I had a mother.
Hey, who you
playing ball with?
Nobody. Myself.
Get your mitt.
Honey, I'm exhausted.
Okay.
AII right.
Let me get my mitt.
Heads up!
Good one.
Thanks.
I'II be right back.
Okay.
You are not
Iistening to me.
I'm Iistening.
He stole $30 from me!
I understand that.
Hey, Nick!
Jonathan asked me to
give this Ietter to you, man.
So he's some kind
of famous writer?
Yeah, that's why
he's staying
at Harbor Street.
JONATHAN: Dear Nick,
many deep thanks
for your warm welcome.
I must say you
seemed anxious.
Of course, writers,
especially poets,
are particularly
prone to madness.
Hey, babe.
Okay.
There exists
a striking association
between creativity
and manic depression.
The only important thing,
though, is to simply
do the work.
It's not a sharp pain,
it's a dull pain. I haven't
eaten in two days.
Hey, straight through
the back, down the stairs.
JONATHAN: Most
of these guys here are
a bunch of fucking
deadbeat panhandlers
and pederasts.
These perverts, they
wouldn't Iast a second
in federal prison.
They are all homosexuals.
I despise homosexuals,
and they despise me.
I know what I'm
talking about. I talk
the straight talk.
I wasn't locked up
in federal prison
with choirboys,
that's for sure.
JODY: Next, please.
Thank you.
Hey.
Hi.
See this?
Uh-huh.
Don't ever become
a writer.
Just around the
corner to the right,
follow the hallway.
You know where to go.
Jesus. Hey, what
happened to you?
I'm fine.
You're fine?
You should get
to the clinic.
You should see
the other cocksuckers.
This is nothing.
By the way,
I have a Iittle
gift for you.
From one writer
to another.
Is there a tailor here?
No.
I'm going to need
a new coat.
Okay.
AII right, so
I won't be there.
But I'II get there
next time, okay?
AII right.
Hey.
You are not just
selling weed, right?
Watch your hands.
Watch your hands.
Why should
a truly great writer
be subjected to these
fucking indignities?
There we go.
JONATHAN: What are
you doing? That's
my property.
Come on,
get out of here.
That's my property.
That's my property.
Fucking homo.
Calm down.
Calm down, now.
I'm going to transform
this cesspool of a world.
I'm going to transform
it with a fucking word!
You know, he is
not going anywhere.
It's been weeks.
What do you suggest
I do about it?
Get a job
somewhere else?
Hey,
you want to do
some blow?
Um...
I despise blow.
Turns people into
fucking scumbags.
But you go ahead
if you want to.
GABRIEL: 12:30, FIoyd Perkins
reports physical altercation.
Report completed.
2:00 a.m., shift change.
Brian gets permission
to sign out.
7:00 p.m., Jon FIynn
was caught
trying to smuggle
a bottle in tonight.
At first he was abusive,
but he calmed down
and was given a warning.
He wasn't put
out for the night?
It's cold out there, man.
He asked me to
give a Ietter to you.
JONATHAN: Nick,
I thought last evening
at Harbor Street,
waiting for 8:00 p.m.
to come...
I thought if your
very beautiful mother
were alive,
and if she could
somehow see this scene,
her son at work and
his father a resident
at Harbor Street
shelter for the homeless.
The beaten, the sad,
the losers in
life's great game.
Jody would have laughed loudly
at the entire macabre scene.
She was the most
beautiful woman
in the world.
She was the Iove
of my Iife.
The Iight of my Iove.
If she were here today,
she would be with me now.
What happened
to my face?
I'm only 28 years old.
Why do I Iook Iike this?
Excuse me?
What happened to me?
What happened!
What have you done to me?
What have you done to me?
COUNSELOR: He kept
shouting at me that
he was 28 years old,
and it just...
It kind of freaked
me out, and I just...
What are you
Iooking at?
Nothing.
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.
Sorry for what?
That it freaked you out?
It's nothing.
Wait until you have
been here a few months.
Easy, Nick.
Take it easy.
I am taking it easy.
This isn't me
we are talking about.
CAPTAIN: No, it's not.
Go ahead.
11:15, tables and chairs
put away in the gym
from overflow.
Did you read
my Iast Ietter?
Yes.
Beautifully written,
wasn't it?
Don't write to me about
my fucking mother.
Your fucking mother?
Your fucking mother?
How dare you refer
to her that way.
How dare you say,
"How dare you," to me.
Well, Iet me rephrase it.
Don't fucking write
to me about my mother.
It only makes you
sound childish using
profanity Iike that.
Sorry, you don't get
to patronize me. Okay?
You don't get to
pretend to be my father
and you don't get to
write about my mother.
In fact, stop writing
me at all.
Stop writing me Ietters.
You should save them.
They'II be worth
money someday.
I have saved them,
actually.
I have over 100.
That's enough.
You saved them. Good.
You bring Iiquor in here
again, you are barred.
End of story.
Eano the Beano tells me
you are into drugs.
Who the fuck is
Eano the Beano?
How would he know that?
Everybody knows,
the word is out.
You know, if so,
good Iuck to you.
But don't waste
your talent.
I don't have any talent.
I find that
hard to believe.
Why? Because you're
so incredibly talented?
Yes.
Okay, so where is it?
The masterpiece.
Where are you hiding it?
Can I read it?
Does it even exist?
Do you exist,
Nicholas FIynn?
Do you even know?
I, Jonathan FIynn, exist!
I know that much.
Jonathan FIynn exists!
MAN: Shut the fuck up!
You shut the fuck up,
or my son will evict you!
I want you to Ieave here.
Find some fucking place,
some old drinking buddy
who is suicidal enough
to take you in.
I'm a sought-after
house guest.
Yeah, because you're
an excellent raconteur.
Right?
Yes!
Good night!
Remember something, Nicholas.
You are me!
You are me!
I made you!
(MEN CLAMORING)
You are me!
I am not you!
I am not you!
Yes, you are!
Go to FIorida!
You are me!
(MEN CLAMORING)
MAN: Shut the fuck up!
Everybody, shut the fuck up!
Night.
NICK: I asked to fill in
on the outreach van.
I can't stand to
be in the shelter
where my drunken
jack-in-the-box can
appear at any moment.
Hey, you are the guy
whose father is
a guest here, aren't you?
No. That guy is
just a drunk.
A con man,
he has nothing to
do with me.
Yeah. No, of course not.
Okay, we're ready.
Yeah.
Okay.
The hours are 9:00 at night
until 5:00 in the morning.
Hi, I got a
sandwich for you.
Hey, excuse me,
sir, sorry to wake you.
I got a sandwich here.
You want to get inside?
(BOTTLE SHATTERS)
"Jonathan Flynn responded to
a guest's request that he
share a can of deodorant
"with an intense
verbal assault towards
"the other guest on
racial and sexual themes.
"Mr. Flynn would not respond
to intervention.
"In fact, he accelerated
his verbal assault. "
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Jonathan's a Iittle
out of control tonight.
"The SPO, Chris,
Gabriel, and Brian,
"escorted Mr.

I was brought into this world

We all need to

Suck-o my cock-o!
You! You!
Where is your faith?
Where is your faith?
Without faith
you are nothing!
You are nothing!
Nothing!
Nothing!
You are nothing!
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Nick.
I'm heading out.
Okay.
Why?
Because you are drunk
and I have to work tomorrow.
So do you.
I'm not drunk.
You're not going
to stay over?
I'm going home.
I think,
after what happened
today, maybe you
shouldn't be drinking.
What happened today?
The vote.
Jon has created
problems in housing.
He is not getting
any better.
He is only getting worse.
I think it's time
that we vote on
whether to bar him.
I'm sorry, I don't think
we should bar Jonathan.
I agree.
We will vote on it.
Well, what day
isn't fucked up?
Right?
Do you want to
get out of here?
SIeep at my place?
Uh, no.
You go ahead.
I will see you tomorrow.
Okay?
AII right.
Who votes to Iet
Jonathan continue
to stay here?
It's freezing outside.
We can't just
put him out there.
Nick.
Hey.
Yeah?
I think you need
to get some help.
What?
You need some help.
NICK: Need help?
What?
Need help?
Nah, it wasn't your friends
who trashed the place.
Have you seen
my notebook?
No.
Fuck.
I got to hand in
an assignment.
Will you Iet me
know ifyou find it?
If it were up your ass...
I'd know where it was.
Can I have a hit?
Smoke crack before?
No.
Don't. I haven't Ieft
the pipe for three days.
JODY: Nick, I read
your short story.
I'm sorry I read it,
I don't mean to
intrude on your privacy.
I have to tell you,
you have always
been so perceptive,
since you were a child.
NICK: Mom?
What's wrong?
Do you miss him?
What?
No. Of course not.
The only person I
give a damn about
is sitting right here.
So then why
are you crying?
I'm not.
I'm not crying.
Are you going to
finish that?
This?
Um...
This ice cream?
Am I going to eat it?
No.
Thanks.
JODY: I went
to the beach,
but I was unable to
throw myself in the ocean.
I did the best I could.
I tried to hold
it all together.
I love you
and I love my dad.
Come on, you're good.
Right up the steps.
AII right, Jonathan,
you can't come in here.
You have been banned.
I've been banned?
Yes, for two months.
Who banned me?
It doesn't matter,
you have been banned.
I have been banned?
Yes, you have
been banned.
Does my son
know about this?
Yes, he knows about it.
Where is he?
It doesn't matter,
you have to go.
Father murderer,
where are you?
I need you to Ieave.
Nicholas! Where are you?
Come on.
Father murderer!
Father murderer!
Where are you?
Come on,
guys, clear out.
Come out!
Come out and face me!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Father murderer!
Jonathan.
Come out! Come out!
Where are you hiding?
In some Iittle closet,
sucking your mama's tit,
father murderer?
I could have jerked...
I could have jerked off
and flushed you
down the toilet.
Father murderer,
come out and face me!
Outside!
Face me,
you father murderer!
Face me!
Out the door, man!
(GROANS)
Hey.
Hey.
Look, Nick.
We're done.
Excuse me?
We're done.
You Iook
really fucked up,
by the way.
I wouldn't Iet Captain
see you Iike that.
Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait, don't just say
that and walk away.
Talk to me.
I had a brother
who was an addict,
my baby brother.
You never told me that.
So, I can't be around it.
Not again.
Look, I'm not...
You're not?
You're not what?
Not my father.
Do you think
I'm my father?
I don't care.
I have to go to work.
Hey, so is your
brother okay now?
Goodbye, Nick.
JONATHAN: If there is one
thing I can't stomach,
it's self-pity.
DRIVER: You,
and you over there.
I work for
the slave traders.
Get your rapid refund.
I'm a human billboard.
Get your fucking
rapid refund.
I sell my blood, type O.
I haven't eaten
in three days.
And so it goes.
Valuable blood.
It's frostbite
fucking cold out here.
I'm losing my left toes
due to not taking
my shoes off at night.
It's all going
in the book.
My masterpiece,
Memoirs of a Moron.
Are we inside
now, or out?
There is no inside,
no outside.
I have to go
to the bathroom.
No container,
no contained.
What's up, old man?
No birth.
What you drinking,
anything good?
Got anything for me?
What? What?
You think you are so
fucking tough, huh?
Come here!
No death.
It's a frigging riddle.
Hey, welcome.
My name is Joey,
and I'm an addict.
MAN: Hi, there.
WOMAN: Hey, Joey.
JOEY: It's good to see
everybody here today.
And it's really good
I'm seeing a number
of new faces.
Actually about
four or five of you.
It's always good to
see new people
coming into the room.
At this time,
I'd Iike to Iet you know
that we do have
free coffee and cookies
over there.
And I can testify
about the goodness
of the cookies.
I baked them myself,
they are fantastic.
(ALL CHUCKLE)
At this time, if you
have something
maybe that you
want to talk about,
something you want
to get off your chest,
go ahead and raise your hand.
We would Iove
to hear from you.
I was 11 when I got high
for the first time,
and it felt Iike
I was home.
Well, I woke up
one morning in Paris.
It took me a while
to figure out that
I was in Paris.
And I had completely
forgotten that I had
flown a 747
full of people
the night before.
I was out of the hospital
no more than three weeks.
And I stayed over
my mother's house.
I couldn't take
it anymore.
I doused my hand
with Iighter fluid
and Iit it on fire
just to get the morphine.
Go figure.
(HYPERVENTILATING)
Psst.
MARIE: I saw your
father the other day.
He didn't Iook so good.
You know my father?
He is a hard guy
not to know.
Thank you.
Your old man
doesn't Iook good.
Someone should
get him inside.
Well, you should
get inside.
We can get you
in somewhere.
He sleeps in the
parking garage, right?
Barlow's garage?
Don't know.
The other day Barlow and Ron
were giving him a hard time.
Barlow killed a guy,
16 years in Walpole.
They shouldn't
have Iet him out.
A guy like that.
Barlow and Ron
lure your old man upstairs...
BARLOW: Hey, buddy.
...to the top floor.
Let's have a drink.
You want to have
a drink with us?
Said they have a bottle.
When they get to the top,
they grab him and
hold him over the edge,
upside down.
I told you not to
come around here no more.
This is Barlow's garage.
This is my garage, bitch!
He didn't drop him?
Said next time
he'II drop him.
He's a freaking psycho,
Barlow.
The manager kicks
you out of this place
at 9:15.
The sign on the door says
it doesn't close until 9:30.
How can he do that?
Is that Iegal?
JEFF: You might want to
close that window.
Last week a rat
jumped into the van.
Hey.
(EXCLAIMS)
Moses! Moses!
Hi, Moses.
It's okay.
It's Nick,
from Harbor Street.
You need anything?
You want to get
in out of the cold?
Hey, you haven't
seen Jonathan,
have you?
No, not for weeks.
Thank God.
(TOILET FLUSHING)
You have to
take it outside.
Hey, welcome.
My name is Joey,
and I'm an addict.
ALL: Hi, Joey.
What the fuck
are you doing here?
Standing Iike some ghoul.
You're Iucky I
realized it was you.
Otherwise, bamo!
Right. Bamo.
Are you here in your
professional capacity?
Scooping up bodies
from the filthy streets
to carry them to
the Harbor Street palace?
A haven for homos?
I'm working tonight, yes.
Come on.
Come on, what?
Come on,
it's freezing
out here tonight.
Freezing?
I don't feel it.
So, they have come
to me with their tails
between their Iegs, huh?
You know what I say?
Fuck them.
Fuck them.
Up yours, Harbor Street.
You are still barred
from Harbor Street.
I think I have
been here before.
Yeah, I was mugged here
once by a bunch of
mother-raping drug addicts.
Thanks, Jeff.
Good Iuck.
Christ, don't tell me
you Iive here.
A fucking hellhole.
I'II have a vodka
screwdriver, please.
There is no Iiquor here.
No vodka?
No vodka.
No vodka.
Fine, it's
evil shit anyway.
You know,
I'm putting some
money aside.
I'm going to get my
Iife back together.
I got a friend
in FIorida.
He's got a job and an
apartment, they're waiting
for me in St. Petersburg.
Right.
You don't believe me,
do you?
No.
No.
That's a terrible
thing to say,
you don't believe
your own father.
I'm going upstairs,
go to bed.
My roommates are
away for the weekend.
You will be unbarred
in a few days,
so you can stay
here for a bit.
Until you go back
to Harbor Street...
Oh, no, I'm never going back
to that fucking place.
Never.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Hey, don't drink
in here.
You know, I have been thinking
about your beautiful mother
and her non-accident.
And I have been thinking,
why would she do
something Iike that?
Ah!
Do you want a drink?
No.
Oh, right. You prefer
the other stuff.
I think I have
a problem with both.
A problem?
Oh, I feel for you.
It must be problematic.
The night she did it,
she read something I wrote.
A story, she thought
it was about her.
Was it?
Yes.
It was about a woman
who works two jobs
and tries to fit in
a couple of hours
between each to
be with her kid.
She works as a bank teller.
She works as a waitress.
She comes home and
waits on the kid.
I wasn't finished
with the story.
I was going to write
how the kid appreciated it,
whatever time
she had for him.
He didn't think
she was a bad mother.
And he Ioved her.
She was all he had.
I didn't write that part.
I didn't get that far.
So that's
the story you tell
ofwhy your mother
killed herself.
I haven't told it
to anyone.
You tell it to yourself.
Those are the best stories.
It's a good yarn.
There is only one
part that's horseshit.
No one kills themselves
because they read a story.
I don't care how
good a writer you are,
you can't kill
someone with words.
I have a theory.
The reason people
commit suicide
is because they
don't Iike themselves.
Self-hatred.
I think it's a very
reasonable explanation.
Don't you?
Self-hatred?
You're familiar
with the concept?
Yes.
Of course,
maybe the question isn't
why she killed
herselfwhen she did,
but why she chose
to stick around
as Iong as she did.
Anyway, my writing is
going extremely well.
The book's classic.
And to answer your
previous question,
it does exist.
As do you.
Why?
Because of me.
Because I made you.
I'm going to go to sleep.
The blanket's on the couch.
(DOOR SHUTS)
Hey!
Hey! Hold on!
Hey.
What are you doing?
Where you going?
Where am I going?
I'm going to my
suite at The Ritz.
They are holding one for me
just in case I ever
want to drop by and use it.
I gotta get going.
I'II be Iate for
the slave traders,
all the jobs
will be taken.
Well, are you coming back?
Coming back where?
Here.
Out of curiosity,
why have you not ever
asked me to stay
with you before?
I thought ifyou try
and save a drowning man
you might go down, too.
A drowning man?
A drowning man?
I'm not a drowning man.
I'm a survivor!
An artist!
I'm not going to
die out here!
I'm not your poor
sensitive mother!
I'm a survivor!
And you know what?
Luckily for you,
you are my son,
so you are one, too!
You are not your mother
and you are not me,
Nicholas FIynn!
I absolve you!
You are not me.
I made you,
but you are not me!
I'II see you again.
Yeah.
NICK: A few months
after that I left
Harbor Street.
Yo, it's the man.
I'II see you Iater, man.
AII right.
Be good.
Yeah.
AII right.
Hey.
Hey.
I'm taking off.
Yeah, I heard.
Thanks.
For what?
For nothing.
For the swift
kick in the ass.
You're welcome.
No more Harbor
Street, huh?
I guess not.
What about you,
you gonna stay here
for a while?
Yeah. I'm not done yet.
I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.
For what?
About your brother.
Oh.
Thank you.
Take care of yourself.
You, too.
NICK: I go back
to school,
finish my
undergraduate degree,
get my diploma.
I take a poetry workshop.
I work in Harlem and
Crown Heights and the
South Bronx, teaching.
In some schools,
half the kids I work
with live in shelters.
So, when Lucille CIifton says,
"Her eyes are animals,"
what is that?
STUDENTS: An image.
An image.
Good, but what
kind of image?
STUDENTS: A metaphor.
A metaphor.
And what do you think
she is trying to
say about her eyes?
My father's letters
follow me.
JONATHAN: Nicky Nu-nu,
you will be happy to know
my writing is doing
extraordinarily well.
Soon, very soon,
I shall be known.
NICK: Within a year,
Jonathan qualifies for
an apartment,
Section 8,
subsidized.
Unbeknownst to me,
some strings have been
pulled by people I
once worked with.
JONATHAN: Yeah?
It's Nick.
Nick who?
Nicky Nu-nu.
Oh.
Nicky Nu-nu.
Just want to
make sure it's you.
You never know
what Iurks in
this neighborhood.
How are you?
How are you?
Shake my hand properly.
Give me a firm handshake.
That's better.
Don't break it.
You're dressed,
that's good.
Well, the place is nice.
JONATHAN: Yeah.
This is my
Iittle paradise.
My Iittle oasis.
My Iittle home away from
my Iittle home.
Well, I'm impressed.
I'm very tranquil,
I'm peaceful...
NICK: Pretty soon he
launches into a familiar
flurry of hate speech.
...young girls being raped,
day and night,
by these bastards,
these pederasts,
these fucking priests,
these cretins,
these homos.
Believe me,
I know all about it.
I wasn't Iocked up
in federal prison
with choirboys, kiddo.
Interstate transportation
of stolen securities,
that was the charge.
The checking business
brought to you by
the great Dippity-Do Doyle.
If I didn't do what he said,
he would have killed
you and your mother.
Believe me, kiddo.
I have trouble focusing,
I consider leaving quickly,
but I will myself to stay.
My job was to enter the banks
and open an account.
I was the only one
able to finesse my way in.
The secret? The secret?
AIways go to
a female teller.
A black? Forget
about the fucking blacks.
Low fucking morale.
Go to them? I couldn't
get on fucking first base
with a black teller.
It's early in the month,
so he hasn't gone through his
disability check yet.
This means he
has been drinking.
...good Russian vodka.
Not that rotgut crap.
Want some?
Uh, no thanks.
New teeth?
Huh?
You got some new teeth.
Yep.
Courtesy of Uncle Sam.
Best dentist in the world.
Looks nice.
Here, I brought you something.
What the hell is this?
It's a book of poems.
Poems.
I wrote it.
Actually, it's
getting an award.
An award, from whom?
From Penn.
Penn.
Are they giving
you a pen?
Is it dedicated to me?
No.
No?
Am I in it?
There are some poems
that refer to you.
Oh. Let's see.
"I'II bend each finger back
Until the bottle falls
"Until the bone snaps
"Save him by
destroying his hands"
Do I detect
a touch of hostility?
I'm doing
a reading of it tonight
at a book store.
You can come,
ifyou would Iike to.
AII right, all right.
I'm going to
Iet you read it.
Your book?
Yeah, The Button Man,
also known as
The Confessions of
Christopher Cobb.
You mean
it actually exists?
Of course it exists.
Where the fuck is it?
It's somewhere here.
Give me a hand here,
Iook in these boxes.
Look for a blue folder.
I think I may have it here.
Yeah. This is it.
Here it is, part one.
This is part one?
How many parts are there?
12. Eight are in existence.
"CIink, clank, clunk.
I think that I am drunk."
Don't read it here,
for Christ's sake.
That part's a musical.
I will read it right away
and get it back to you.
Don't steal anything.
I promise.
NICK: I read his book
in one afternoon.
JONATHAN:
It's a masterpiece.
I read your poems.
That one about
the gun is heavy.
Of course it's
an inherited quality.
If you didn't write well,
I would be surprised.
For 30 pages
it shows promise.
Then like his life,
it soon falls apart
and dissipates
into incoherence.
His manuscript
is incomplete.
As far as I can tell,
the only completed
book about my father
would be the book that
fell to me to write.
Me, my father's un-credited,
uncompliant ghost writer.
I've been in touch
with Little, Brown.
They are doing my book.
Four million
dollars in advance.
Little, Brown said my
book's a masterpiece.
Everything I write
is a masterpiece.
"The eyes
of the action hero cut
from the poster
"AII that
concrete pressing down
"A fine edge
gleams around your body
"As if it could
be contained
"The way each finger is
Iicked, dipped in and rubbed
across the gums
"Until the teeth go away
"Even my hands kiss you
"A night broken down
into grains
"If you find
yourself Iost, dig
"A cave in the snow, quickly
"You need shelter
against the night
"A candle could
keep you alive
"The engine of your Iungs
will heat the air around you
"Someone will miss you
"They will send out dogs
"You must be somewhere,
right?"
Thank you.
There you go.
Thanks.
Thanks for coming.
Hey.
Hey.
Uh, he's here.
Jonathan, this is Inez.
Inez, this is Jonathan.
A very great pleasure.
It's good to meet you.
And this is Maeve,
your granddaughter.
Would you Iike
to hold her?
Uh, that's okay.
No, he can hold her.
I have held babies
before, Nicholas.
See?
(CRYING)
See?
(CRYING)
See?
See?
See?
Yeah, I see.
JONATHAN:
All right, Nicholas,
you can have it.
I bequeath it to you.
You have the last word.
