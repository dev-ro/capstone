Harufa.
Aye, Captain.
Sound for a depth.
A sounding? Here?
- Aye.
- Aye, Captain.
Does he expect to land here,
past the very end of land?
Perhaps hunger has
crazed his mind.
His belly is
as empty as ours.
lf there was land, it would be such
as no man would dare set foot upon.
Sinbad would.
He dares anything.
Captain!
Full fathom seven !
Sharp lookout aloft, there!
Aye, Captain !
What can it be?
Perhaps a sunken reef.
Or a sea-serpent
or something worse!
Full fathom five!
Oh, let it be land.
Land ho, off the port bow!
He has the eyes of an owl.
l see nothing.
Look! There!
Land it is!
All hands, look alive!
Drop anchor. We'll go ashore
at the first light of dawn.
May AIlah grant
we find food and water.
And may Allah grant
we find nothing more.
This is no time of night
to be knocking at a lady's bedroom.
l would speak with your mistress.
l bring good news.
l know your sailor's tricks.
Now off with you.
Go and steer your course elsewhere.
Sadi...
you must be more polite
to the captain.
He is not responsible for the mysterious
winds which blew us off our course.
Or are you?
l blame him for taking you from
the safety of your father's palace...
to this.
l came willingly, Sadi.
What good news, Captain?
We are anchoring off an island.
Tomorrow we take on food
and water to continue our voyage.
The food comes none too soon.
That pirate Harufa
has already found eyes for my pet.
ln a week you'll be
feasting in Bagdad...
at our wedding.
l think you invented the island
for just this purpose.
For another such kiss...
l'd invent a whole continent.
Bananas! Melon !
Here, have a coconut,
and grapes.
Captain Sinbad is filling his cask
with fresh water from the spring.
Stay here until he returns.
A cloven hoof.
Here, there's another!
What a stride!
Captain Sinbad, look!
Captain!
What is it?
lt has the mark
of some ancient civilization.
lt has the mark of Satan himself.
Come, Sinbad.
Let us go back to the ship.
Hold this.
l'm going to see
where that stone mouth leads.
Help me!
To the boat-- quickly!
From the land beyond beyond...
from the world
past hope and fear...
l bid you, genie, now appear.
l obey the master of the lamp.
l command you to build me a barrier
between those men and the Cyclops.
l shall try, O Master.
l shall try.
What weird power
restrains that monster?
The man who holds this treasure
is safe from even greater danger.
lf your lamp has such power,
why didn't you destroy the monster?
The genie of the lamp
cannot be used to work harm.
But in protection,
his powers are invincible.
Look out!
Help!
Oh, my prayer is answered.
You are safe.
Hoist all sail !
Full starboard rudder!
Head for deep water!
- Come on.
- The lamp! The magic lamp!
For your ship,
a king's ransom in jewels.
For you forget one thing,
my triend.
The Cyclops will be
on guard now.
Besides their great strength,
they have the magic lamp as well.
The Cyclops have no speech.
lt is useless to them.
l alone can invoke
the power of the genie.
Who are you?
l am Sokurah...
the magician.
ls your lamp so precious you would
risk your life to return to the island?
There is nothing l would not do
to regain it.
Your ambition has nearly
cost us our lives already.
lf you are indeed a magician, why do you
not use your power to slay the Cyclops?
l had prepared a potion
for just such a purpose...
but l could not persuade the Cyclops
to swallow it.
Captain, the winds that drove your ship
to the island of Colossa...
have wrecked many vessels
on its shores.
The treasure of a hundred years
has been gathered by the Cyclops.
The wealth
that awaits us there is worth...
many, many thousand times
what you see here.
We are on an important mission
for the caliph of Bagdad.
Our presence there means
the difference between war and peace.
l'll not risk that
by turning back.
That is my final word.
Perhaps when you are
safely in Bagdad...
you will be persuaded to feel
differently about the venture.
l doubt it.
Harufa, show the magician
to his quarters.
With fair winds
we should reach port in five days.
Magician, your jewels.
My lord Sinbad is
a very great prince in his country.
The people rejoice
for the news l bring:
peace between
your father's kingdom and ours.
And do you love me
just to save Bagdad from destruction?
l love you
because l cannot do otherwise.
Your eyes are mightier
than all your father's armies.
Three times welcome, Sinbad.
You have done wonders to avert a war.
And what fair prize is this?
The princess Parisa,
daughter of the sultan of Chandra...
pledged to be my bride.
A symbol of lasting friendship
between our kingdoms.
Welcome as a daughter, my child...
for l love Sinbad
as my own son.
l thank you, kind sir.
My father, the sultan,
sends his wish for your health...
and bids me tell you he will arrive
within a week for our wedding.
And a royal wedding it shall be,
with all the honors of our court.
Tell me about your journey, Sinbad.
Oh, a strange voyage
and a strange tale it is, my caliph.
l did not think any place could be
more beautiful than Chandra...
yet Bagdad is.
The city is made lovely
by your presence.
Without you it is plain.
Now that we are here, all the strange
terrors of the voyage seem unreal.
Yet they were all too real
at the time.
Perhaps it is all a dream...
and the one-eyed giant a nightmare.
And is Sokurah the magician
also a dream?
He is very real, indeed.
There is something about him
which frightens me.
lf only he would vanish
when l awaken.
He is determined to gain possession
of the magic lamp.
His life is distorted
with this single, driving wish.
l pity him...
for l have my one wish.
lllustrious and magnificent
Caliph of Bagdad...
l am honored to be summoned
to your presence.
Sinbad says you are a man
of unusual powers.
lt is our wish
that you demonstrate your skill...
at a welcoming feast for the sultan.
Your wish shall be granted
even before it is asked.
l promise a performance that will live
in the memory of the caliph...
for all his days...
may he live a thousand years.
You please me already.
Your palace is a jewel
of comfort and hospitality, but--
- But?
- My happiness would be complete...
if you would but grant me
a single wish.
State it.
A fast ship and a well-armed crew...
to return to my island.
Ships are costly,
and lives are not to be wasted.
l have here the design of a new weapon,
a giant crossbow...
that will protect the men from harm.
l cannot judge, for l have not yet
seen the one-eyed giants.
Sinbad, what is your opinion?
Tales of our voyage already
have spread through Bagdad.
No one but a madman would ever
sail a ship back to Colossa.
Sinbad's word...
is my word.
Until the sultan's feast then?
Are you sure you can be happy
here in Bagdad?
Very. l love Sinbad more
with every sunrise.
l had such doubts
after l let you go.
lf anything had happened to you,
they would have paid with many lives.
Father, you're getting angry.
Now, you mustn't, you know.
Oh, here comes the caliph.
Now, smile at him. He's a very nice man.
May your illustrious presence
in my humble palace...
return to your own house
a thousandfold.
lf my daughter is happy,
l have honor enough.
Daughter.
Remember, not only will you triumph
over good and evil...
but you will be
the most exotic woman in all Bagdad.
What must l do?
Leave everything in my hands.
l have arranged a presentation
which l think will arouse your interest.
Summon Sokurah the magician !
ls that not Sadi,
your waiting woman?
Yes, Papa. She has offered herself
as the magician's subject.
lf he can turn her into a contented
woman, he is indeed a great magician.
lt's a serpent.
Papa, she will be killed!
Allah have mercy on them both.
Oh, Papa.
Behold!
lt is impossible.
l am asleep.
lf so, l share your dream.
- l assure you she is unharmed.
- Sadi, are you all right?
Well done, Sokurah.
lf l have pleased you,
l hope you will grant my request...
for an expedition
to my island of Colossa.
You are truly
a man of great skill...
but l do not change my mind
so easily.
Perhaps a further demonstration
of my powers is necessary.
The art of prophecy
has always fascinated me.
Can you foretell the future?
l can, upon occasion,
foretell certain events.
lt would please us to have you look
into the future of our two countries.
As you wish.
l shall require
a brazier of live coals.
You shall have it.
Guards!
May the unseen forces grant
that l see nothing but good.
My spirit races
ahead of time itself.
Ask your questions.
What do you see here in Bagdad?
l see, but l cannot speak.
You must.
l see great disaster.
l see--
l cannot tell!
Go on! l command you!
There are great buildings falling...
women and children slain.
l see war!
War between Bagdad and Chandra.
You lie!
What of my daughter's wedding?
There will be no wedding.
Mysterious and evil forces
are at work...
and the wedding rejoicing shall be
turned to mourning.
You have done well, Sinbad.
l could not bear to have
that charlatan frighten the princess.
l spoke at your insistence.
The events my spirit saw
lurk as dire possibilities.
lf you request,
l will use my powers...
to disperse the evil forces
and avert such disaster.
ln return l presume l must grant you
the ship and the sailors you desire.
Such a gift of gratitude
would seem fitting.
So, your lies are cheap schemes
to force me to grant your wish.
Get out! You have committed treason
against both Bagdad and Chandra.
lf you are found within the walls
of our city by sunset tomorrow...
your eyes will be torn out...
that you may see
no more evil dreams.
To the wedding
and our lasting friendship.
Good night,
though l wish the night were gone.
Tomorrow will come soon...
and all the nights thereafter
cannot come soon enough.
l cannot imagine waking
to see your face instead of Sadi's.
She was indeed transformed tonight
by that magician.
Suppose that his prophecy--
l'll dream of dangers he predicted...
so you can rescue me.
After the wedding,
the procession will pass here...
then pause before the throne
where you and l will be seated equally.
My lord!
- Where is she? Where's my daughter?
- The princess!
Sinbad, here l am!
Sinbad, look,
here on the pillow.
- Look closely.
- No.
No, it cannot be so.
lt is.
The world has grown very large
overnight.
lt's true.
lt is you, my darling.
My daughter-- where is she?
Where is my--
Ten thousand devils!
What evil sorcery is this?
My daughter-- is it you?
Speak, tell me my eyes lie.
You see truly, my father.
l would have borne any insult...
but my dear one...
my daughter.
Look upon your city.
Enjoy the sight...
for soon it will be rubble
and bleached bones.
Sokurah, wait!
- The princess, she has been--
- l know. ln my vision l saw her state.
But l feared to tell you
because of your great anger.
Tell me, can you help her?
Possibly.
No. No, the risk
would be too great.
lf she can be helped,
l will do anything.
l cannot turn back.
lf l am in Bagdad at sundown,
my eyes will be dark forever.
l'll answer to the caliph for that.
Now come quickly.
No, l--
Tell us quickly
what must be done.
There is one secret potion
which will remove the evil charm.
- Mix the potion with no more delay.
- We lack the most vital ingredient:
a piece of shell from the egg
of a giant bird called the Roc.
A monstrous bird that nests
on the peaks of Colossa.
The same. Without this shell
the potion is useless.
We have no choice, O Caliph. l must sail
at once and bring back the eggshell.
No, the princess must go with us.
Only in my castle
can the potion be used.
l'll order a ship
to be provisioned at once.
We'll need your design
for the giant crossbow.
The palace jeweler can make
a tiny home for the princess.
Where will you find
the crew, Sinbad?
The bravest of my former men
will sail with me.
That will not be enough.
Where will you find the others?
l'll find them...
where men fear the headsman's axe
more than the Cyclops:
in the caliph's prison yard.
Hear me! Hear!
Come hear!
l am Captain Sinbad.
l am here with an offer
of freedom.
l have come to raise a crew
for the hard and dangerous voyage...
to the island of Colossa.
The land of the Cyclops!
We may be thieves and murderers...
but we're not fools.
The caliph of Bagdad has
offered you fuIl pardon.
He offers us a choice
of two kinds of death.
l fought with the Cyclops,
and here l stand, alive as you.
This man was at my side,
and he sails with me again.
Well, what'll it be?
We need five and twenty men.
Freedom or the hangman's noose!
They'll not put a rope
'round Golar's neck!
He'll spit in the Cyclops' eye first.
- That's right. Come on!
- Let's go!
- Me too!
- l'm ready!
Take me! Take me too!
The ship's hold is filled with the
giant crossbow. There's no more room.
Then lash the arrow
to the mast.
Aye, aye, Captain.
Careful! We may need that arrow
to fight for our lives!
We're all fools!
lf we're to fight for our lives,
let us fight against men, not monsters.
There are rich prizes
plying the coastal waters.
This vessel could be ours
for the taking.
What of those men
who are loyal to the captain?
We'll feed 'em to the fish.
Heave!
l fear this will be a tedious voyage
for you without Sadi.
l shall never complain,
not as long as l am near you.
A hazardous voyage, too,
in spite of all the plans we've made.
lf you were as small as l,
you could walk among the giants unseen.
They are not our only danger.
We must sail uncharted waters
with a doubtful crew.
l sometimes wonder what they would think
if they could see me as l am.
l do not trust them
out of my sight or in it.
Yes?
Captain, can I have
a few words with you?
For the past week
there has been unrest among the crew.
l have heard dangerous mutterings.
All weapons have been locked
in the forward cabin.
Without knives or swords
they can do nothing.
ln a few more days
we should reach the island.
Something troubles your appetite,
Sinbad.
l shall be glad when we arrive.
Sinbad, how can you love a tiny...
insignificant female such as l?
A diamond is a tiny thing...
yet it is very precious
and beautiful.
Quickly, Princess!
Stop! Do not kill him!
We surrender!
Harufa, we must give up.
This is a touching show
of friendship. Take his sword!
Here. The magician's cloak
will make a flag for us.
Here are the men who would
feed us to the one-eyed monster.
What shall we do with 'em?
Kill 'em!
You hear the verdict.
You die at dawn.
And my wish for a night
of pleasant dreams.
Hear my curse,
for it seals your doom.
Those who harm us
shall be driven mad!
Terror shall be in your hearts...
and before dawn you will plead with us
for your very lives.
Oh, save me.
Oh, save us, magician,
save us!
For you l will tie the knot myself...
so you will strangle slowly.
Throw 'em in the forward hold!
Helmsman!
Take a course due south.
We'll circle back
to the trade routes. Go on !
Could have sliced them all to bits,
and you stopped us...
to save this idiot
who babbles nonsense.
You will see.
Winds and currents will
drive the ship southward...
and my prophecy will come true.
What makes you so certain?
South of Colossa lies
an accursed island...
inhabited by wailing demons.
Their screaming is heard
over a hundred leagues.
Men hearing it are driven mad.
They drive their ships
onto the jagged rocks...
and are devoured by sea serpents.
What's to prevent us
from sharing their fate?
lf we stuff bits of cloth
in our ears.
Well, that's fine.
Now we won't be driven mad...
we'll just be devoured
by sea monsters.
Here. lf we wax the cloth
it will stop most of the sound.
The wind screams like 10,000 fiends!
Full port rudder!
Change your course!
We'll be wrecked on the rocks!
Ho, lookout!
What can you see?
Hold this course
or you'll die!
Steer us out!
High winds and seas
surround the demon island.
The sound penetrates even here.
Give me that glass!
Full port rudder!
l'm gonna release them!
Full port rudder!
Save us, Captain...
before we're wrecked.
There is a narrow channel
through the rocks.
lt is our only chance.
Has the whole ship gone mad?
Full port rudder!
Sharp lookout
for the peaks of Colossa!
Crossbow will be assembled
and ready within the hour.
Keep the men at the crossbow.
l would rather go with you.
l know, my friend,
but you are more valuable here.
Everything is in readiness.
The sooner we leave,
the better. Come!
Here.
Who's in command
of the great crossbow?
You are.
This is the valley of the Cyclops.
Beyond, in the center of the island, are
the peaks where the great birds nest.
Then our path lies
through the valley.
Your path.
We separate into two groups...
because, if one group is captured...
the other may attempt to free them.
We meet the far side of the valley...
tonight at sunset.
May the powers of good
protect all our footsteps.
We will stop and rest here
and proceed again at nightfall.
You, Golar,
do not drink so deeply.
We will need the water
for our climb tomorrow.
Why so miserly?
We can fill the skin from the pool
when it's empty.
- That's right.
- This water is poison.
The man who lets it touch his lips
will be dead in a moment.
Poison?
Would you care to try it?
Wait here a moment.
What are you doing here?
Don't worry, master.
The crossbow's in good hands.
Let us get back to the others, Harufa,
before the return of the Cyclops.
They were here a moment ago.
See if you can find them.
Captain Sinbad!
Come, quickly!
Here! Through here! Hurry!
We're rich ! Come, master!
Take your fill !
Pearls, rubies, gold-- everything!
Out of here, all of you !
There'll be time enough for treasure
after we finish our mission.
Out, hear me?
Or, by my sword, l'll run you through!
Let me go!
Sinbad's men must be trapped.
You will remain here.
Help! Help me!
Sinbad, help!
Must we thirst here
while water runs all around us...
just because of the magician?
He has strange powers.
We dare not disobey him.
- Golar dares.
- That's right.
Then drink from the pool
he has forbidden.
You think he's afraid, eh?
Here. Show them.
Hey!
That's good!
Tastes like choice wine.
Help! Sinbad!
Help me, Sinbad!
Lend me a hand.
Maybe l can reach the latch.
Come here.
There's a latch on top of the cage.
See if you can open it.
Why does he leave us?
He leaves us
to share the fate of Harufa.
But we shall escape.
Escape? How?
You must never reveal
what you are about to see.
- We won't, just get us out of here!
- Anything, anything! Save us!
Princess, there's a latch
on top of this cage.
Will you see if you can open it?
l'll do my best.
l see the latch.
l'll try.
Sinbad, it is stuck!
l cannot move it!
You must try, Princess.
lt's our only hope.
The lamp!
lt is done, Sinbad!
Lift me up!
Must we hide here so quietly...
while our comrades are in danger?
Are we afraid of Sokurah?
Who's afraid?
Then follow us.
Courage, Harufa.
Put out the fire.
Let's get out of here!
The lamp!
Here. Here l am!
Over here!
Over here! Closer! Closer!
A little further now.
Here! Closer!
Look! There he is!
He's dead!
The danger is far from past.
There are still Cyclops alive.
l alone know the words that will
summon the protection of the genie...
therefore, l should have the lamp.
l do not trust you.
When l called you to free us,
you made no attempt to open the cage.
l do not understand
the power of this lamp.
But if we need it,
it shall be safely within my grasp.
As you say.
Poor Rahan.
Allah knows many ways
of dealing with hungry men.
Look. We have reached our goal.
There's something
moving inside.
lt is a season
for the young birds.
Higher up there will be eggs
already hatched.
Come this way.
No more climbing, please!
We're starving.
Here.
Let us break open the egg.
Put down that spear!
You should not
have let them do that.
Hungry men don't ask.
They take.
Here. The princess
must be restored without delay.
That eggshell must be combined
with other elements...
to be found in my cave
at the foot of the mountain.
But that's at the edge
of the Cyclops' domain.
What protects your castle
from them?
You will see when we get there.
- l'm glad to breathe the fresh air.
- Good news, my princess.
We have the eggshell
which will make the potion effective.
Your words are happy,
but your face is sad.
Why are you troubled, Sinbad?
l do not trust the magician.
Our only hold over him
is this magic lamp...
and he alone knows the secret
of its power.
Let me enter the lamp.
Perhaps l can talk with the genie
and learn how to call him.
But is such a thing possible?
Well, who knows what's possible
within a magic lamp?
Please let me try.
All right.
lf all is not well, call quickly.
l will. l promise l will.
- Are you all right, Parisa?
- Oh, fine!
There's a wonderful mist down here.
Be careful.
Welcome, Princess Parisa.
You know who l am.
A genie knows many things.
And you're as tiny as l am.
How else could l live
inside a lamp?
And such a lovely one.
Had l known how beautiful it is,
l'd have visited you long ago.
You must be truly happy here.
The most comfortable prison
is still a lonely place.
But aren't you sometimes called
to our world to work your wonders?
But then l'm summoned as a slave...
to do the bidding
of whoever holds the lamp.
l long to be free--
to be an adventurer...
and to sail the seas
as Captain Sinbad does.
But those are dreams for real boys...
and not for a genie.
ls there no way
to escape your bondage?
Perhaps, some day...
but l cannot return
to the real world...
until l am called by my name.
- What is your name?
- Barani.
l have a promise of freedom
inscribed in the lamp.
- Would you care to see?
- Yes. l should love to see it.
lt is here.
''When the big that is small...
shall again become tall...
into fiery rock
to rise you must fall.''
''When the big that is small.''
l was big, and now l'm small.
- Then you know what it means?
- l'm not sure...
but l'll make you a bargain.
lf you'll help me, l'll help you.
What do you want me to do?
Tell me the magic words
that caIl you forth from the lamp.
l like you, and l wish to help.
But l don't know.
lt's a great power to grant.
ln return, l promise
l'll try to help you, Barani.
Now tell me the words
that invoke your protective power.
From the land beyond beyond--
From the land beyond beyond. Go on.
From the world past hope and fear--
From the world past hope and fear--
l bid you, genie, now appear.
l bid you, genie, now appear.
The genie was very nice to you.
Yes. He promised to help us
if we'd help him.
And we will help him.
Hey, look!
From the land beyond beyond...
from the world past hope and fear...
l bid you, genie, now--
Harufa, the lamp!
From the land beyond beyond...
from the world past hope and fear...
l bid you, genie, now appear.
O mighty Sinbad, the slave of the lamp
is yours to command.
- Where is the Princess Parisa?
- She is a prisoner of the magician...
in his underground castle
at the foot of the mountain trail.
l will meet you there.
But how will l know?
Go ahead. Turn it!
lnside the cave
you'll find another wheel...
with which to loose the dragon,
so that he may guard the entrance.
l knew l could trust your Sinbad
to bring the lamp to us.
Now l will show you a sight
which will make your heart leap.
Behold.
Sinbad, l'm here!
Come this way!
He hurries to greet his princess.
l must prepare a welcome for him.
l warn you,
tell him to do as l ask.
Are you all right, Parisa?
Oh, yes. l'm all right.
Restore the princess at once.
l will restore her
in exchange for the lamp.
At once.
The potion is already prepared.
Bring the princess here.
Give me the eggshell.
lf you harm her, you die.
l'm here, my princess.
And now, if you please, my lamp.
You shall have it
when we are safely at the ship.
Very well.
Let us go.
Kill. Kill him.
- We're trapped.
- We must summon the genie quickly.
From the land beyond beyond...
from the world past hope and fear...
l bid you, genie, now appear.
Command me, O Princess.
Help us escape from this cave.
l shall try, O Princess.
Hold tight, Princess.
- What is it, Princess?
- l remember now.
The genie's verse: ''lnto fiery rock
to rise you must fall.''
l made a promise to the genie.
This is the fiery rock.
And the lamp must be thrown into it
if he's ever to be set free.
lf we lose his help now,
we may never reach the ship alive.
And if the lamp is thrown
into the flaming pit...
he may be destroyed.
Still, your promise must be kept.
Let's go.
Follow!
Follow!
Kill!
Follow! Kill!
Ali!
- Yes, Captain.
- Man the crossbow.
- Take the princess to the longboat.
- Yes, Captain. Come on, Princess.
Hurry! Come on ! Hurry!
Pull !
Pull !
Follow!
Pull for your lives!
Follow! Kill!
Pull for your lives!
Farewell, Colossa.
l'm only sad about one thing.
l shall miss Harufa.
And l'll never forget
our little friend Barani.
- Barani?
- Oh, his one wish...
was to sail the seas with you.
- You called for Barani? l am here.
- Why, it's the genie.
No longer the genie, Captain,
but your cabin boy.
Then you must prepare my cabin
for a feast of celebration.
l already have, Captain.
See for yourself.
Why, it's the treasure
of the Cyclops.
l put it on board for you...
as sort of a wedding present.
Well done, Barani. l know you will be
as good a sailor as you were a genie.
l shall try, Captain.
