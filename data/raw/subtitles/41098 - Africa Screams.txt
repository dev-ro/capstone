This is a
harmless little kitten.
Buzz I'm scared to death. Why
the look on his face.
I can't understand why you have
this terrible fear of animals
in you. What is it?
- When I was a little baby I was scared by my piggy bank.
- That's nonsense.
- You want to hear something worse?
- What?
I was 15 years old before I ate
my first animal cracker.
Come on, stores about to open
up.
Fix up your counters. Now get
to work. Come on, go on.
And how. Yes sir. That's the
truth.
- How do you do? May I help you?
- Do you happen to have a copy
of Dark Safari by Cuddleferd?
I'll find out.
Hey Bub.
How do you do gentleman.
We like to speak to salesman pal.
- Well I'm the salesman Stanley
Livington.
I'm the clerk in charge of all
jungle books. And at 11 o'clock
I'm giving a lecture.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got a book by the name of ...
- Dark Safari by Cuddleferd.
Dark Safari by Cuddleferd. We
did have it but we got rid of
it sometime ago.
I want to tell you gentlemen I
read that book. I had
nightmares for 9 months.
How well do you remember that
book?
- Why?
- Do you remember a map then?
- A map in that book?
Of course
I remember it.
- Could you draw it?
- Could I draw it?
- For a $1000.
Draw that map in that book for
$1000? Ha ha, for $1000 I could
draw that map in oil.
OK then meet us in the ally
tonight at 7:30.
And we'll take you to somebody
who will give $1000 the minute
you lay down the pencil.
- Is it a deal?
- Shake. Oh!
- OK pal see you in the ally tonight at 7:30.
- And be there chum, get me.
$1000 to draw that map. Ha ha.
- I'm sorry but that book is out of print. In fact we sold the last one some time ago.pp- Oh dear I was afraid of that.
I've been to every bookstore in
the city. There is a map in
that book that I would give
$2500 for.
Will you give me that again
please?
I said there was a map in
that book that I would give
$2500 for.
$2500. Excuse me I'll be right
back.
What are you doing?
Hey Buzz this you'll never
believe there were two guys in
here....
I understand. Look Stanley how
well do you remember that book
you read about Dark Safari?
That's what I'm trying to
tell you. There was two guys in
the...
Look you remember there was a
map in it.
You too. Now go away, go away.
- What are you doing there?
- I'm drawing that map now.
- Oh no you don't.
- What a minute.
- Oh you...
Buzz Don't tear that up. I
got a chance to...
Wait quite, quite. Come on
follow me now. Oh take it easy,
take it easy.
Madam you are the luckiest
person in New York this
morning.
- Allow me to introduce Stanley Livington. One of
the world's greatest wild
game hunters.
Well how exciting. Why game
hunters are my weakness. This
is really a thrill Mr Livington.
So nice meeting you to but I'm
really not...
It might interest you to know
that when Mr Cuddleferd wrote
Dark Safari Mr Livington was
right there.
- Oh.
- Wonderful.
Well then you must
be very familiar with the map
that is in that book?
- Map.
- Yes.
- Our sure.
That's one map that I can draw
in a darkroom even without a
pencil.
You see your troubles are all
over.
I could make arrangements to
bring him over to your home
this evening.
Oh Marvelous I think it's a
wonderful idea.
- My name is Emerson, Diana Emerson.
- How do you do Ms Emerson. But
no I have a date in the ally.
- She'll have to wait.
- She'll have to wait oh.
Here's my address. See you
tonight then.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
That's the kind of girl I dream about. But you should see the ones I get.
(Whistles)
I tell you boss the guy said he
knew the map backwards. So we
make a date to meet him.
Bring
him in and have him draw it.
Yeah and the little muzzler
never shows up. After us
offering him a grand.
- Well you can relax I found somebody myself this morning.pp- You did boss? Where?
- In Kloppers Department Store.
- That's where we found our guy.
Wait a minute. Was he a silly
looking little fat guy?
- That's him.
- Why that two timer.
You offer him $1000 and he holds out forppa higher price.
- The minute he puts his foot through the door I'll break every bone in his head.
- You'll do no such thing.
- When he leaves you boys can meet him outside and get my money back.
- We get you boss.
Now go out the side entrance.
I'm closing a deal with the man
who is going to lead the safari.
Won't you come in Mr Beatty.
This is the place. Now don't
forget she thinks you are a big
game hunter.
Buzz why do you keep getting me
in the middle? I wish you
hadn't.
Why you ingrate. Here I am
giving you a chance to make me
$2500.
Is that the way you want to
repay me for all the things I
could have done for you?
Come on.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh come on.
Stanley will you come on?
- I'm shutting off the water.
Well turn it off and come on.
- I stopped it.
- Good come on up here.
May I see you a minute please?
- Now what's the matter.
- My fingers stuck.
- Leave it there and come on.
- Ok.
- What's the matter. Let me see
this.
Not that one, not that. Not
that one! That one!
- Don't holler.
- Don't pull out that one.
- Wait a minute.
- Harry did you answer the door?
- No do I have to?
- Answer the door.
- Oh all right.
I do everything around here. I
have to be a cook and a butler.
One of these days I'll just..
Well.. That's all I'll just...
do it.
(Knock, knock)
Yes.
- Mr Johnson and Mr Livington to see Ms Emerson.pp- Well come in.
(Knock, knock)
Well who is knocking? Well come

Ms Emerson is busy for the
moment will you step in the
living room please.
- Hats.
- Thank you.
Ow that hurts.
- That belongs on outside.
- Yeah I can't get it off.
- Help me get it off.
- Will you keep your hand...
- Not so hard your..
- Get your hand out of the way
now.
Get your hand out of the
way.
Well get your hand out of the
way I'll get it off.
Naturally I haven't publicized
the expedition cause I could
easily become the victim of
unscrupulous people.
If that map is one of the few
in existence.
The owner would
practically have you in the
palm of his hand.
This man coming tonight is the
gullible type but fairly
intelligent.
If he could remember the map
accurately we will proceed at
once.
- That would be fine with me Ms Emerson.pp- Now regarding your fee.
Suppose we say $5,000 in
advance and $15,000 on
completion.
- That's very liberal.
- On the contrary.
Money is no
object as long as I get what
I'm after.
- Come on will ya.
- Ha ha there it is.
- Oh not that hand this one.
Well put this hand in your
pocket. Ow get your hand out of
there.
Ow sometimes if.. Oh.
Stanley I just found out that
map is worth more than $2,500
to that woman.
- I can't get over it, all I did was go like this and the water came out.
- Are you listening?
Come on.
Come on!
You go in the living room and
wait. I'm going to snoop around
here and find out more about
this deal. Go ahead.
- Who was at the door Harry?
- Mr Livington and Mr Johnson.
- Good where are they?
- There in the living room.
- I'll see them in a minute and
have coffee in the library.
- Harry I'm phoning Gunner to come over. Please leave the door open.pp- Yes Mam.
Excuse me. I didn't know anyone
was in the room.I'm awfully
sorry.
Say hold it right where you
are. You know you standing in
front of this here picture
reminds me of my last
expedition in Africa.
- Is that so?
- Yes indeed. Yes indeed.
And it was my most dangerous
expedition.
- We were after cats, big cats. You know what cats are?
- Lions I imagine.
Oh there is no imagining about
it my friend. Lions are lions,
here or anyplace they are lions.
You can't imagine the lions. Oh
no indeed. I want to tell you
something.
My first afternoon out I bagged
64 lions.
- Gad what a hunt.
- Really?
- Oh yes.
- Then I ran into an old friend of mine Clyde Beatty.
- No.
- And was he irked. He didn't bag a lion for 2 weeks ha ha.
- Really?
I bagged them all he couldn't
get one of them.
Of course when it comes to
hankering lions he don't know
from nothing.
I am the boy
right over here.
I want to tell you something
else too between you and I.
Clyde Beatty is a phony.
On the side a pretty nice
fella. But between you and I a
phony.
Something else I want to tell
you friend.
Who do you think
tames the lions that he has
inside the cages?
- Me Stanley Livington the world's greatest hunter.
- No kidding.
- Yes sir, well one of the greatest. By the way what's your name?
- Clyde Beatty.
Clyde Beatty. Clyde it's nice
knowing you. I want you to
stick around,
cause I want to tell you how I
used to go in myself and tame
those lions.
Now when it comes to taming the
animals Clyde. Clyde! Clyde!
Aw good evening I see you've
met Mr Livington our big wild
game hunter eh?
- Yes indeed.
- Swell.
He's juts been telling me
about some of his exploits.
Oh swell, swell that's fine.
Tell him about the time you and
Clyde Beatty went tiger hunting
in India.
- Yes I'd like to here about it.
- Stanley tells me that he out
shot Beatty 5 to 1.
- By the way I don't you introduced me to this gentleman.
- Clyde Beatty.
Clyde Be... Clyde Beatty. I'll
be seeing you around.
Mr Beatty I'm sorry for what I
said about Mr Beatty. Excuse me.
Why Mr Johnson and Mr
Livington please forgive me for
keeping you waiting.
You met Mr Beatty?
- It seems Mr Livington and I are old hunting pals.
- Won't you gentlemen have tea.
And after coffee we'll have Mr
Livington draw the map.
I'm terribly sorry but Mr
Livington will not be able to
draw the map.
But he's got to. The whole
success of my trip depends on
it.
You mean you intend to take a
trip to Africa?
- Very definitely I'm planning a safari.pp- I wonder if I may be excused.
I know you folks would rather
talk business in private.
If you don't mind I think it
would be better. Mr Beatty's
hat Harry. Excuse me gentlemen.
Goodnight old friend.
Quick Grappler and Boots are
outside waiting to slug Johnson
Livington.
Tell them the plans
have changed and to lay off.
Yes Mam.
Look Buzz let me draw the map
we'll get $2,500 and get out of
here.
Certainly not. Now if I play
your cards right we'll get more
than $2,500.
- Listen you heard her she is organizing a safari.
- I wish I was there.
- Where?
On the Hoboken safari right now.
- Uh..Uh.. Stanley you are
absolutely right.
- As you surmised, to be frank with you, I don't blame you for having the desire.
- The desire to what?
- Of course I'll have to explain everything to the lady.pp- Explain it to me.
Uh Mr Livington insists on
joining your safari to Africa.
- I insist.
- There you are, you heard it
from his own lips.
Just a hold... How do you do?
You see with Mr Livington in
Africa he'd feel right at home
and it would be very simple for
him to draw the map without any
difficulties.
- I think it's an excellent idea.
- Surely.
Once we are there he can lead
us to the east fork of the
Talabongo and Okavangy river.
- Lead you to the fork?
- Yes surely of course it will
be the regular $5,000 fee in
advance and $15,000 on
completion.
- Of course that includes my services.PP- Why splendid.pp- That's fine.
- And for your safety I am going to assign you my best follow upper.pp- Follow upper?
Yes he is the man who follows
you in the jungle. And if you
miss a shot at a charging
animal he shoots and saves your
life.
(Crash)
- Oh that's him now. Excuse me.
- Surely.
- Hey listen Buzz. I'm not going over there. You got no right to out me in a thing like that.
- All this kind of money?
- You're always putting me right in the middle..pp- Don't tell me...
I don't care what kind of
money it is.
- Don't you give me that..
- Now Listen..
- Aw no arguments...
- I'm not going to go over there with all those lions roar!
- You'll do as I tell you.
- Roar. I'm going to...
- You'll do as I tell you no
arguments.
Oh no I'm not. I wont.
- Gunner I'd like to have you meet Mr Johnson and Mr Livington. Gunner Jenson.pp- Hi.
I don't want to seem
inquisitive but just what are
going to Africa for?
Why we are going after an
Orangutan Gargantua.
- An Orangutan Gargantua.
- Excuse me please.
- Pardon me.
- May I see you.
What's Orangutan Gargantua?
- It's a big ape.
- Big ape.
- Yeah stop worrying.
- Big ape. Excuse me, excuse me.
- Pardon me.
- Big ape?
- Yeah.
- You mean like the thing that I see in the circus like the father to the monkey.
- Yeah it's only bigger, bigger.
- Ping. And he's going to protect me?
- Um huh.
- Um huh.
Gunner show them how you can
shoot the winchester.
You missed the lion. I raise
the gun to my shoulder and look
threw the peep sight and I....

Aside from the Orangutan there
are far more important things
to be found in that particular
territory.

personally think I'm entitled
to new deal.

safaris profits would be fair.

Now this map will take you

He wrote that he had a very
uneventful day.
Therefore he
made camp on a bank of the
Crocodile River.
Now over there is a crocodile river.
Eh Uh.

At night Cuddleferd, he posted
a double guard because he was
nearing the Bangy Country.
Which was full of ferocious
animals and cannibals.
Stanley is right, this is
pretty dangerous territory.
- I suggest we pitch camp on this side tonight.
- That means we will lose an
entire half day.

Well according to Cuddlefer,
when he crossed the river he
was brought down by Jungle
Fever.
And he was that way for 36
hours.
