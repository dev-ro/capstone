"Dear Vicky...
"...during my time away from you, I've
learned more about the circumstances...
"...surrounding the death of my brothers
at the hands of Tong Po.
"Tong Po... the same man that
had me framed and sent to prison.
"It started with my brothers Eric and Kurt.
Eric went to Thailand
to fight their champion."
How do you feel about fighting
our champ Tong Po?
- Piece of cake.
- Think so?
That's the way they fight here, I told you!
Motherfucker wants a street fight?
I'll show him.
- Let's cancel.
- No.
- Let's cancel, please!
- No!
"He permanently crippled Eric by cheating."
No!
"Kurt wouldn't take Eric back to the U.S.
until he avenged the defeat.
"To prepare for his battle with Po,
Kurt studied with the legendary Xian."
You must learn to be faster
than any punch or kick.
"After months of training,
Kurt was ready to face Tong Po."
I'm a better fighter than I ever was before.
I'll win that fight for you and me.
Yeah!
"Kurt won his fight.
"He avenged our brother and dishonored Po.
"Disgraced by his loss...
"...Tong Po tracked my brothers down
and shot them to death in an ambush.
"But killing my brothers was not enough.
"Po traveled to America to force me to
fight him so he might regain his honor."
The most dangerous weapon
in the universe is a focused mind.
"Having quit fighting to teach,
I wanted no part of this war.
David Sloan will give Tong Po the rematch
that his brother's death denied us.
"To force me into the ring, his men
set fire to my gym, killing a young boy."
David!
"Now I had no choice but to face the enemy."
This is my fight.
It's just something I got to do now.
"After winning that fight,
I thought I'd seen the last of Tong Po.
"Then you and I met, started our school,
and everything was wonderful, Vicky...
"...until my arrest.
"But even that isn't enough.
"I've heard Tong Po's men, the same ones
that framed me, may be after you.
"You must hide and remain safe
until my release.
I love you, Vicky. David."
Get out of the car. Come on!
- I can walk!
- You'll walk when I tell you to walk.
Come on! You see this? This is home.
Let's go. Let's go pronto! Come on, baby.
- Asshole!
- Both of you shut the fuck up.
You think you're tough,
you got a big boyfriend. Get down!
Take the cuffs off.
- You sure, amigo?
- Just do it.
Hey, you the boss-man.
Come on, baby. Like that, right?
No boyfriend's gonna save 'em now, huh?
Let me tell you something! Listen to me!
Only men got balls, you stupid bitch!
Hello, Mrs. Sloan.
I hope that you had a pleasant trip
crossing the border.
Who are you? Why have you brought me here?
Maybe... you've heard of me.
Tong Po.
I've heard of you.
You're the pig that framed my husband.
I am afraid so.
However, I thought I'd make it up
to him by taking care of his little wife.
Go, Po.
No! No!
Sloan, Jackson, Martinez!
Mail call.
Sloan. Martinez.
Step back.
Place your hands behind your back.
He's all yours.
It's been a long time, Sloan.
Every time one of you assholes from the
DEA shows up, my life takes a bad turn.
- What is it this time?
- I don't blame you for being bitter.
I get busted trying to bring
a major dealer to the U.S. for trial...
- You weren't supposed to kill him.
- Hey, it was him or me.
- Tong Po saw to that.
- That's not how the court saw it.
He's got my wife, Casey. It's been two years.
- She's probably dead.
- Maybe you can do something about it.
In the last five years, Tong Po has become
the most powerful drug lord in Mexico.
He's got a damn fortress in the desert.
The DEA has been trying to take him out
the last three years, and has come up empty.
- We can't get close, but you might.
- Yeah?
Every day of the dead, Tong Po invites all
the top fighters from around the world...
...to compete at his compound.
The winner takes on Po for a million bucks.
So the agency needs me again
and just like that, I'm out of here.
It's all been arranged.
Po's men in here will be made to think
that you're in solitary again.
You'll compete in the tournament...
if you qualify, that is...
...under an assumed identity. Remember...
...if Po recognizes you, you're dead.
It's been a lot of hard years
since Tong Po's seen me.
Remember, we know
you want to rescue your wife.
We think that's fine.
The prime mission here
is the elimination of Po.
I'll kill him.
"There's a street fight at 3rd and Santa Fe.
"Brubaker has to invite you
to Po's tournament.
P.S. Good luck saving Vicky."
Come on!
I'm coming for you! For you!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Can't take your girlfriend anywhere, can you?
Maybe I make you my girlfriend, huh?
Hell of a fight, Jack. Hell of a fight.
Practically had him sucking eggs in there.
I ain't never seen anybody
fight like that before.
Five centuries ain't gonna
get you far in this life.
You in the mood for some serious action?
Depends on your definition of serious.
What are you, some kind of intellectual
or something? I'll tell you what, Jack.
Why don't I make a call, see if I can
get you into a heavier grind...
...with some serious client?
Do it.
You'll probably have to go
to Mexico for the score.
- Is that a problem, Jack?
- Only for the federales.
Good. You make it down to Calixico
by tomorrow night?
- For what?
- Big tournament, but you got to qualify.
They like you, they pay my commission.
So do me a favor, Jack, huh?
Kick some royal ass, okay?
Jack. Jack!
Don't you want to know what the payday is?
Doesn't matter.
A cool million. That sound good to you?
Yeah, it doesn't sound bad.
But I'm warning you, some don't make it back.
That's too bad for them.
Strange motherfucker.
Yeah, yeah. I'm sending you a new guy.
Yeah, some bastard who fights like the devil.
His name's Jack Jones. And, listen...
...don't piss him off.
What's up, blondie?
- You're looking pretty good, baby.
- Looking real good.
- Don't piss me off.
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, man.
- Hey, look.
Bitch!
You got a problem with this?
First of all, you see this?
- You know, you should be more careful...
- Fuck you. Keep your opinions to yourself.
- You know, a simple thank you would do.
- Yeah, okay. Thank you, asshole.
You're going to Mexico
for that competition, aren't you?
When we meet, let's just assume
we never met each other.
- Jesus.
- You had to have the last word, didn't you?
- Yes?
- Jack Jones is here.
Okay. Thank you, Mateo.
Mr. Jones, we've been expecting you.
I'm Darcy. This way.
You're one of the last fighters to arrive.
I just found out about
the tournament a few days ago.
You almost missed
the final qualifying matches.
I thought I was in.
A lot of people want
to get into the tournament.
- We only want the very best.
- Yeah.
You're lucky to have gotten this far.
Impress the man up there,
or it's a long trip for nothing.
I'm in charge of hospitality.
So if there's anything you need, just ask me.
Oh, I'm sure I'll be fine.
Some of the world's most
dangerous men are here.
Brubaker was very taken with you.
He said you're a hard man.
Just how hard are you, Mr. Jones?
Hard enough.
- Go on. Get him out of here.
- Good luck, Mr. Jones.
Looks like you just made it
in time to qualify.
Better strip down, pretty boy.
Okay, next! Rodriguez and Thomas.
Let's go, center of the ring.
Any style, everything is legal!
Which means there are no rules,
so let's fight!
Hey.
Don't you think that's enough?
That...
...is enough.
Get him out of here.
Excellent, Thomas.
Okay, next.
You...
...and you.
What, you need Q-tips in your ears, boy?
You gonna fight or what?
Are you in or out of this thing?
Look, don't fight it. I'll put you out easy.
Yeah? What makes you think
I'd let you put me out at all?
You don't want to be involved in this.
Should I order some Chinese food
or something?
No! You're right. I wouldn't want
a chance at winning $1 million.
- Eat me, motherfucker.
- How lovely.
Maybe you need to train her, pretty boy.
I'm not gonna fight her.
I'll destroy her short life.
Hard head, huh?
Look, I'm giving you a break, okay?
You ain't nothing, shit-for-brains.
A pathetic way for things to end.
Your next fight won't be so easy!
Get this little mouse out of here.
I don't like being followed.
8191 Mannix Avenue. Sound familiar?
- Maybe.
- Your house... and your dojo.
- Am I right, Sensei Sloan?
- I don't remember you.
How about my brother Andrew?
You saved his life.
You got him out of Red Ball Pirus,
and you made him an instructor.
You're Andrew Smith's punk kid brother?
Yeah.
I don't remember there being
much hope for you.
Andrew straightened my ass out.
Said you got fucked over
and ended up doing some time.
That's history.
Wait'll everybody finds out
that Sensei Sloan is here.
There'll be the sound of 100 bricks
shitting at the same time.
You can't tell anyone who I am.
Anything you say.
You need anything, Sensei, just ask.
- My wife's being held here.
- Come on. Let's move it, guys. Come on.
- By Tong Po?
- We'll talk later.
That guy's a lowlife sicko scumbag.
- You see all kinds here.
- Yeah, I bet.
So, what do you do here?
A lot of things, but not
what you seem to be thinking.
I'm very particular about who I sleep with.
Well, they must do something
for sex around here.
- Is that where they keep the women?
- You don't need to worry about that.
I'm sure you have no problem
getting your own girls.
Hey.
What's gonna happen to that young girl?
- Is Tong Po gonna send her home?
- The punk?
- Yeah.
- I wouldn't count on it.
Tong Po has a particular fetish
for young girls.
- And that's all right with you?
- I didn't say that.
What happens when they get older?
They become me.
Get cleaned up. The party starts soon.
The rain in Spain...
...falls mainly on the plain.
The rain in Spain...
...falls mainly on the plain.
The fighters are being
called in for the celebration.
May I have your attention, please?
Shut the fucking music off.
Welcome to the Sian Memorial
Tournament of Champions...
...the greatest competition
of its kind in the world.
My name is Bill. If you have
any needs to be taken care of...
...food, beverages,
sunblock, extra pillows...
...pussy...
...that goes for you, too, girls...
don't hesitate to call on me...
...Bill, your humble fucking servant.
Now let me introduce our host.
A great humanitarian...
...board-certified psychotherapist...
...a visionary record producer...
...3-time national Thai champion...
...6-time Sian Memorial Tournament
of Champions champion...
...Tong Po!
I would like to make a toast...
...to all the wonderful men
and women here today.
It is an honor to have
such a distinguished group...
...participating this year.
As you know...
...the lucky winner will receive...
...$1 million!
Enjoy today's festivities...
...for tomorrow at 7 a.m...
...the competition begins!
How are you gonna compete in the tournament?
Won't Tong Po recognize you?
I'll find Vicky tonight
and get this thing over with.
How long has Po had her?
Two years.
Last time I saw her was at that birthday
party you had for her at the dojo, remember?
We had a great time, man. Boy, I got wasted.
Yeah, you sure did.
So, Mr. Jones, see anybody you like?
- Nobody here's our type.
- I certainly hope you don't mean nobody.
I've had enough of this.
I'm going up to my room.
Silence, please.
A fighter who was eliminated has requested
a second chance to compete.
I have decided to allow her an opportunity...
...to prove her worthiness before us all.
She may look sweet, gentlemen,
but I assure you...
...inside there is an iron tigress.
Who among you will risk his or her place
in the tournament to fight Miss Laurence?
A $25,000 bonus to whomever defeats her!
Bastard. She'll be killed.
Who would like to take her on?
I'll take her on!
Bitch!
Who was gonna get killed?
Maybe we should forget about the tournament
bullshit and go for the million right now.
Bitch.
Much too pretty a face to be punched out.
Don't be stupid, boy.
Now go back and enjoy yourself...
...while I take care of this...
little distraction.
No.
Take them.
You heard Mr. Po. Get that little bitch!
Well, well, well...
...it's exciting to have such a talent
in our humble tournament.
Fight me now.
You win the tournament, you get me.
If you wanted her all to yourself...
...why didn't you just say so?
Well...
...enjoy the rest of the party.
I guess I should thank you.
I just got tired of listening to his shit.
Come on, let's get you cleaned up.
What are you gonna do
with a million bucks if you win?
I don't know.
Retire, I guess.
From what?
From what?
Yeah, from what? You know, like a job?
Well...
Right now, I'm unemployed.
I thought you just said you'd retire.
Yeah, well, I'd retire from unemployment.
Okay. Here.
Keep this on your face.
It'll keep the swelling down.
You don't intend to go
through with this, do you?
I have to win.
You're gonna lose.
It's just another beating.
It's a chance to make something of myself.
Here, keep this on your face.
I got to go.
Hello, Lando. I thought you might
be lonely here by yourself.
- What gave you that idea?
- Let's call it woman's intuition.
Aren't you gonna invite me in?
Sure.
I'm having a little trouble with this.
Could you help me?
Darcy...
I knew... you'd have all I want and more.
- I can't do this now.
- What are you talking about?
- I can't explain.
- The tournament?
That sex-before-the-fight
stuff's just a myth.
Look... I can't do this now.
Just leave. Please?
You're a damn pussy tease.
Or maybe you really don't like girls.
Or maybe you just like underage tramps.
- I'm sorry.
- Go to hell.
No, I got nothing here.
Nothing, man.
So...
- Hey, Don, okay?
- All right.
Security break-in, section 4.
Security break-in, section 4.
Let's go! Let's go!
Sian, because of me, you are dead.
I shall not rest until you are avenged.
Excuse me, master.
May I speak with you for a moment?
Why do you interrupt my prayers?
There's a trespasser in the containment area.
- These two failed.
- Sound the alarm.
I want the intruder... alive.
Look, I'm sorry I choked you out.
Yeah, you got lucky.
You didn't belong in the tournament.
I guess we'll see.
- What, they didn't throw you out?
- They're giving me a second chance.
The tournament's wrong for you.
At least maybe I can help you.
- What's it to you?
- Do you want my help or not?
Well, that move you did
on me was pretty good.
Why don't you show me that one?
I got a better one for you.
See, you're small,
so you got to use the art of surprise.
When you face your opponent...
...make him focus on one
of your weapons, your legs.
Get him to start staring at your feet.
Make him look at your feet.
Make him be focused on your feet.
And then, when he's looking down...
Pop up with a hook. You try it.
Last night...
...someone took advantage of my hospitality.
Please be warned.
This compound is private property.
You are guests here.
All trespassers will be severely punished.
Now, the first day
of the tournament will begin!
Vernon and Craig, enter the ring.
Jackson, Wilson!
Center of the ring! Let's go!
Vincent, Chang!
Enter the ring!
Amin, Carnowsky! Center of the ring!
Bannen, Vargas!
Center of the ring.
Grab her!
Hold her, man! Hold her!
Bitch!
Laurence... Black.
Center of the ring.
Come on, beautiful.
All right, baby!
I got her, man.
You dead meat, baby!
Come on! Come on! Bring it on to me now!
You got rid of him. I ain't nothin', huh?
Well, come on, show me then!
Show me what you got! Come on, shorty!
Come on! I'll kick your ass!
I'll kick your ass! You hear what I said?
Come on.
- Get up, Coffee!
- Get up, man!
Smith, Kid Wheeler. Center of the ring.
Jones... Matthews.
Center of the ring.
Darcy, you didn't even smile at me?
- You're not gonna talk to me?
- There's a tournament going on.
Yeah, I know that.
Hey, wait. Where are you going?
You did pretty good today.
Want to go dancing later on?
Fuck you!
I got to find a way in there.
I might know a way in.
Hi.
- Get the hell out of my doorway.
- Wait a minute, Darcy.
I just came to make a peace offering.
I wouldn't drink champagne with you
if you were the last man on earth.
It's a good thing
I'm not the last man on earth.
You're wasting your time. You had
your chance, Lando, and you blew it.
Fuck the champagne.
Darcy, I got to ask you something.
Yes?
I need to know where Tong Po
keeps a woman and how to get to her.
You can't possibly be serious.
- I'm not enough to satisfy you?
- That's not it.
I need some help finding her.
She's been here two years.
Oh, my God.
You're here to free that woman.
I need to know how to get into that building.
It's guarded.
- Lando, I can't. I'm sorry.
- She doesn't belong here.
None of us do.
She's my friend. I have to save her.
And who saves me?
Tong Po will kill me if he finds out.
What if I tell you I can get you out of here?
Start you off with some money?
Who are you, Lando?
I'm just here to save a friend
that needs me, that's it.
I can offer you the same.
You want to stay here?
I mean, what's gonna happen
when you get older?
I don't see anybody around here that age.
- I can leave here whenever I want.
- Can you?
How can I trust you?
Who else do you have?
Lando, you son of a bitch.
- Thanks for the help.
- Good luck.
You're mine.
Lovely. Just beautiful.
You are surprised to see
I have... music talent.
Do you play an instrument, my friend?
I'd like to,
but I'm a little tied up at the moment.
Once more, Mr. DEA agent?
I'm Mr. Smith to you, and I'm nobody's agent.
What are you doing here?
I'm doing an article on your house
for architectural digest.
"The homes of the evil and depraved."
Answer my questions!
I said go fuck yourself!
Oh, great.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
Darcy...
...is a beautiful woman.
What are you going to do?
All right, I'm DEA!
Anything else?
No, damn it!
Please don't cut her anymore.
You motherfucker!
Sloan!
I had to, Sensei. I didn't know...
It's your fault she's dead, Lando.
- There's something I got to tell you.
- What?
I haven't told you what I grew up to be...
...DEA agent.
- I'm your backup.
- You're DEA?
I guess you were right
when you said there's no hope for me.
Every contest today is a fight to the death.
Some of you are not prepared
to go to this distance...
...so now is your opportunity to leave.
Thank you for the hospitality.
Get out!
Anyone else?
Finish it.
Finish it.
This tournament is a memorial
to my wife Sian.
Five years ago, the DEA tear-gasses my home.
Sian was caught in the fire that followed.
David Sloan...
...was responsible for Sian's death.
He will be punished in the Thai style.
For $500,000 bonus, who will challenge?
Just have my money ready.
This is not gonna take long.
It's time you learned
to show a little respect.
Win... and you get me!
And perhaps, Vicky might be saved.
- Is that enough?
- Yeah! That's enough.
That's enough.
Okay! Who is next?
You! Fight or die!
You don't have the guts
to fight him yourself.
Kill Sloan! Or you all die!
It's all been a lie.
There is no money.
You saw what he did to the others.
He intends to kill us.
You're mine!
You're a little bitch.
I thought you wanted to fight me...
...defeat me in a match, regain your honor.
Killing my wife only shames you forever.
Maybe he's right.
Hold it, or she's dead!
Move away real slow.
