All I ever wanted
was a father who loved me.
Someone to protect me
and guide me through life.
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.
I wasn't sure if he'd pay,
or even show up.
But it was never about the money.
- I'm here.
- Alexander T. Hope?
- Do you have the money?
- Yes. Let me talk to my daughter.
Follow directions
and stick to the plan. Am I clear?
- A barge is approaching the bridge.
- I see it.
Go to the centre of the bridge
and throw the case on the barge.
- How do I know you'll release her?
- You don't.
- Shit. Cellular phone.
- It's probably hers.
Being crooked, I'm surprised
my father involved the police.
I guess he was just using them
to retrieve the money.
- Have the chopper ready to go.
- Chopper standing by.
- Where's my daughter?
- In the trunk of her car.
We've got the location.
Let's get some backup.
Everything was going
according to plan.
There was only one thing that
I never could have anticipated.
There's a green BMW.
That's our car! Hit it.
All units, I'm following
a green BMW. ETH 1.
Headed west on...
Where the hell are we?
Stay right on him.
You with the case, set it down.
Put your hands on your head.
- Where's the chopper?
- With the barge. We lost the money.
- How?
- The chopper blew it away.
We lost the money. We lost
the hostage and we lost the perps.
I don't believe this.
RELIABLE STORAGE
Thank you.
This guy says he's expected.
He's not on our security list.
Mr. Perkins is a colleague
and friend of the family.
- I'm Emily's uncle.
- We'll wait till they make a move.
- What do you know about they?
- We saw a man in her BMW.
- Dark hair, Caucasian.
- He wasn't apprehended?
No... What was your name again?
I'm sure these gentlemen are doing
everything within their power.
This is a very trying time. I'd like
a moment alone with Mr. Perkins.
Sure, we'll be outside.
The fools also lost the ransom.
Hi.
Why bring them in?
Kidnappers always insist
the police are kept out of it.
I have a problem. I have to close
a deal in Brussels on the 25th.
- I have to be there in person.
- It must be important.
They're all important, Raymond.
This one more than most.
- Are there people against it?
- There always are.
Could be they're behind this,
playing on your concern for Emily.
- Wouldn't you think that?
- Put a lid on this.
I don't want it
turning into a circus. Not now.
You should've called me first.
- Vincent, what can I get you?
- Just a cup of coffee.
- Are you going to be long?
- Two minutes.
- Turn the VCR on...
- A lot of cops around today.
Don't mind them. They do it twice
a year, right before an election.
Rousting crack dealers.
Shit!
Put the tape in
and hit the pause and record...
- Sir...
- Hang on a second, honey.
- My wife is in the hospital.
- Just hit the record button...
I've been waiting here
for God knows how long. Long!
- Come on over.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Can you put that in a paper cup...?
Greg, we have a problem.
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, meet me at the warehouse.
Hope residence.
Miss Emily. One moment, please.
- Cell phone again?
- Shit!
Emily? Where are you?
You tell me. I don't know.
- I'm in a warehouse full of cars.
- Now you're in trouble.
- Guess who?
- Uncle Ray? Why are you there?
- Looking for you. I missed you.
- Ray, I've been kidnapped.
You're father's concerned.
I've never seen him so upset.
I don't know what to do.
This place is locked and barred.
- Maybe I can talk to someone?
- Someone? Who?
- Who's letting you use the phone?
- There's no one here. I need help!
Sir, can I have my car keys?
- Can I have my keys?
- Hold on.
My hand's going in my pocket, okay?
- Give me my keys and let me go.
- How did you get out?
The trunk popped open.
You can have my car, just let me go.
Don't look at me.
- I'm not going to hurt you.
- You're not going to hurt me?
- I don't even carry a gun.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
- All right.
Stop. That's not cool.
Give me that.
That was a good kick.
I don't want to fight.
I don't want to fight.
I'm not going to hurt you,
all right?
Are you mental?
I told you, I don't want to fight.
It wasn't me who put you
in that trunk. So cool it.
I have to pee.
- I can do this on my own.
- Put something on that cut.
- What?
- From one of those tubes.
Asshole.
You don't know where you are
or who I am. Don't do me like that.
You're done?
You don't want to play any more?
Vinnie? It's pay day.
I got your money. I got half
what we got for the Porsche.
- What's the problem?
- We've got a problem.
- Shoot.
- A big problem.
- I get in the car...
- Is that the car?
- I love this colour.
- Listen to me now.
I'm driving out of the lot, thomp!
Two undercover cars on my tail.
Red cherries and everything.
I'm driving against traffic.
The adrenalin is pumping so hard
I can't see straight.
- What happened to the cops?
- I lost 'em.
Great. Nothing to worry about.
Did we order a Ferrari?
- You are a genius. Beautiful!
- Greg, the problem ain't over.
What?
I bring the car in.
I put it on the hoist.
- I look, and the thing is moving.
- Right, it's on a hoist.
I bring the car down
and open the trunk. Bang!
- I find the owner in the trunk.
- The owner?
- Let me out of here, asshole!
- Who's that?
That's the owner.
- Will you uncuff me now?
- Jesus Christ, she's good-looking.
Your friend has kidnapped me
and you're an accomplice.
- I'm not an accomplice to this.
- What's your problem?
- You're both gifted speakers.
- She's got a good sense of humour.
- She's seen your face, right?
- I wanna get rid of her.
- Did she see the building?
- She was in the trunk.
- How did she get out of the trunk?
- I don't know.
If she doesn't know where we are,
put her back in and drive her away.
- Where should I dump her?
- I don't know. Take her to a show.
Take her anywhere...
way outside the city.
The medicine cabinet.
- Be careful. She scares me.
- Yeah, she's quite a challenge.
Greg...?
- Put the guys back a while.
- Call me.
- Get in the trunk.
- I'm not getting in the trunk.
I can't have you see this place.
I'm not going to hurt you.
- You're sticking me in the trunk.
- Don't look at me.
- The easy way or the hard way?
- You said you wouldn't hurt me.
- It'll have to be the hard way.
- What's the hard way?
- What will happen to my car?
- Forget the car. Think of yourself.
You promised you wouldn't hurt me.
You're a liar like everyone else.
- Please, get in the trunk.
- Can I just wear this cap?
- Look, I can't see anything.
- How stupid do you think I am?
- How stupid is there?
- Get in there.
- Give me this.
- You didn't have to do that.
Put that out.
- Put that cigarette out.
- All right.
- Put your seat belt on.
- Don't take me too far.
- Keep your head between your legs.
- I had plans tonight.
- Understand?
- Yes.
Be friendly now.
- You had plans tonight?
- That was before I was kidnapped.
- What are you looking for?
- Names and phone numbers.
Anything to do
with her life these days.
- Does she have a boyfriend?
- If she does, we've never met.
- Look at that.
- When was this?
She was, I guess, ten.
She'd just got her black belt.
- I wasn't there.
- I know.
Look at that. Can you believe it?
She had that framed.
H El RESS BLAM ED
FOR BOARDI NG SCHOOL FI RE
- This could be one of her games.
- Really?
What did I do this time?
Forget her birthday?
- So she takes me for $1 million.
- I don't think it's about money.
Don't you mess with my car.
I'm very attached to my car.
I'll puke all over your car.
It's been long enough.
I'm getting it back.
Don't paint it shit-brown.
How much will you and your
faggot boyfriend get for it? $40?
Why did you steal it?
You wouldn't know about
pride of ownership or what loss is.
You steal.
You probably get a hard-on doing it.
All part of the run-till-you-drop,
razor's-edge world of auto theft.
I once stole a Ferrari
with a chihuahua in the back.
- He made less noise than you do.
- He speaks!
- No one knows shit about Hope.
- We know he's rich.
Dirty money. Money in banks
in the Caribbean and Switzerland.
When that ransom money blew away,
he didn't give a shit.
Maybe he just
doesn't show his feelings.
There's a warehouse on fire
right in our target area.
- Can I have a cigarette?
- You can smoke in the trunk.
- What's your name?
- John Doe.
John Doe...
Why are we turning? I don't think
this road goes all the way through.
Are you stopping?
Do you have to pee?
I'd like to pee.
- Sorry about the conversation.
- Thanks. My hands are killing me.
The ride's over. Get out.
You can't be serious.
You've got to be kidding.
- Did you dump the chihuahua here?
- It's 20 minutes to the highway.
- It's dark.
- It's night-time. Hit the road.
- Bye.
- I can't go.
Do I have to drag you out?
- A girl can always get picked up.
- I can't get out.
Don't throw any kicks or punches.
Just get out.
Not here!
Take me back to the highway!
Please, don't leave me here.
Don't be afraid. Stay right there.
Look, a shooting star. Make a wish.
- Wish you were here.
- No, I'm going to die!
- You can't leave me here.
- Get off the damn hood.
Are you going to leave me?
Look what you did.
You scratched the paint.
You're a real screwy kid,
you know that?
Get in!
It's your lucky day.
Gas, food and lodging, two miles.
- You can't drive me two more miles?
- It's just business. Come on, road.
I hope you enjoy my car.
The kid did some major shopping
this month.
A Porsche Carrera, a Mercedes 500 SL
and a Ferrari Boxer.
- I drove one of them once.
- I'd never drive a car like that.
There's too much anger out there.
Too much envy.
If I saw a guy like me driving a car
like that, it could get very ugly.
Know what I mean, Gus?
I'm talking to you.
- Which way am I going?
- Straight. Turn over here.
Holy shit!
Look at that. Keep moving.
Let's get out of here.
How are you doing?
I've got $15.50 in number two
and whatever you've got.
$28.35.
The ownership of every car but one
is unclear.
That last car is a BMW.
License plate ETH 1.
It belongs to missing
kidnap victim Emily T. Hope, -
- daughter to millionaire
Alex ander Hope, -
- who was recently investigated
for ex change violations.
Police think this could've been
the hideout for the kidnappers.
- Do people live in this area?
- There's a few artists' lofts.
- What about the fire?
- A young guy lived there.
I hope he's okay.
He told me he was an artist.
I know about him.
I came over to see his stuff.
- I'm a painter, also.
- Really?
Was the warehouse his studio?
Did he live there?
He lived there.
He comes here for breakfast.
- He's got another place up north.
- Is that right?
Yeah, he sent me this postcard
last time he went.
That's you. Look at that.
Smile... Look at that!
Some things never change.
That's great.
They don't write 'em
like they used to.
"Devil Moon". That's a classic.
Could I buy one?
Yeah! I've got it in cassette, too.
Great. Thanks.
- How about one of each?
- Sure.
Emily. Can I have a word with you?
Your car burnt up.
Emily!
Emily, I'm dead meat.
Listen, you don't understand
what's happening.
My warehouse burnt down. They found
your car. They know you're missing.
They all think I'm part
of your kidnapping prank.
- There are people after me.
- I'm not one of them.
Stop walking! It's driving me crazy.
Get off the street.
I'm sorry I stole your car.
Believe me, I'm sorry.
- I don't need a kidnapping rap.
- That's not my problem.
Can you just call your family?
Tell them you're fine.
Then I can get to my house
and get on with my life.
- You're asking me to help you?
- Yeah.
- Why should I?
- I've been nice to you.
- Nice?
- Yeah, under the circumstances.
It's been a pretty rough day.
You had me handcuffed in your car.
You almost left me
in the wilderness.
I've got a Twinkie in the car.
It's all yours if you want it.
Make this call for me.
I'm asking you in a nice way.
Please, make this call for me.
It's not like I'm asking you
to turn water into wine.
Come on.
- What car did the kidnappers drive?
- A white Cutlass Supreme.
I don't have any money.
- 206...
- 206-555-0166.
- Collect call from Emily T. Hope.
- Hope residence.
I have a collect call
from Emily T. Hope.
- Go ahead with your call.
- John, is my father there?
- Emily, where are you?
- Hi, Dad, I'm okay, but...
Daddy, he made me touch his penis.
Touch what?
I didn't really want to call him,
you know.
- Get away from my car.
- I've got to get my bag.
- Get away from my car.
- I've got to get my bag.
I wouldn't want to be handcuffed
next to me, the way I feel now.
Where's the key?
Give me the key. Spit it out.
You made me swallow it.
Open up.
- Open up.
- It's not in there.
- It's gone.
- You crawled out from under a rock.
Watch the road.
What are you looking for?
I told you. I swallowed the key.
I hate this brush.
You won't find it in there.
I'm the only one who can straighten
things out for you, so relax.
Your phone call just added 30 years
to my prison term.
I'm now a child molester,
kidnapper and rapist.
I'm going to the police station
to turn myself in.
I'd rather be there
than sitting here with you.
There he is. Look at that.
Vincent's warehouse burnt down
and Kistler's out eating linguini.
- You want to do this?
- No, I ain't dressed.
All right, I'll be right back.
- Hey, I'm Stick.
- Monique.
- Will you excuse us?
- It's okay.
- Stickster, sit down.
- Funny guy.
This place is very eclectic.
Don't you know that word?
How about "catastrophic"?
That's more relevant.
Pay attention, birdbrain.
Did you see Vincent?
Did you give him the money?
Did you see the place get torched?
- What?
- That's right.
It made the news.
What about Mr. Dokas?
It's his niece's birthday. 21,
and no Ferrari. She won't like that.
- Gosh!
- What?
Vincent was talking about Brazil.
It's nothing, really.
Vincent's got the money and is going
to Brazil. And you say, "Gosh!"
What sort of word is gosh?
That's it? Oh, Monique is back.
Gosh!
You keep saying gosh.
See how far that gets you.
You really look good.
I don't usually like guys
who drive this kind of car.
What is it? An Aston Martin?
Wait! You've got a phone?
Is that your phone?
- You have a phone?
- Yes, no one has this number.
- Answer it.
- It's probably a wrong number.
What'll happen
when you're really in trouble?
When you cry help, and everyone
thinks you're playing games.
- This has nothing to do with you.
- Let me talk to Vincent.
Vincent? Who's Vincent?
- Who's letting you use the phone?
- I'm alone.
Ray, stay out of this.
I tell you...
Vincent, John Doe, whoever you are,
drop me off at the next motel.
All right, you're all checked in.
Let me ask you a question.
Do you have the key?
- Do you?
- Don't hurt your precious car.
I don't give a damn.
It's always in the boot.
Sorry about that.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- It's been real...
- Yeah, you know my face and my car.
It'll be interesting to see
what happens. How old are you?
Twelve.
All right, if you say so.
- You'd better be careful.
- Yeah, what the hell.
Bye.
I'll tell you a little-known fact.
They base the colours of BMWs
on women's mascara.
Phone call for you, Greg.
It's Vincent. He says it's urgent.
Where the hell are you?
Don't say you're at the airport.
I'm up at the cabin.
Did you get my message?
- Just tell me what happened.
- We lost it all. It burned down.
I know, I also know two guys
who are really unhappy about that.
It was arson.
You've got to warn Dokas.
- Dokas wants his money back.
- We're lucky. I have it right here.
Be with you in a minute.
Just bring it down here.
I shouldn't be driving right now.
I've been driving all night.
- Let me get a few hours of sleep.
- Okay, I'll meet you half way.
The Knotty Pines bar. 3 o'clock.
Don't let me down.
- Got it.
- Gosh!
- Yeah, that's her.
- Did she seem scared?
No, I don't think so. The guy's
okay. He's got a real cool car.
The first time he was here,
he bought a bottle of Jack D.
- Was he alone?
- Yeah. He came back with the girl.
- She used the phone.
- Did you hear what she said?
No... but I did see them
kissing in the car.
- Kissing?
- Yeah.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
- Hi.
- It's cool, man. It was arson.
- It could've been Indians.
- Are you going someplace?
Let's give Mr. Dokas a call
so I can tell him what happened.
Do I look like I work
for somebody called Dokas?
- I'm Uncle Ray.
- Is that supposed to mean anything?
Emily's Uncle Ray.
Jesus Christ!
I tell you... I am no kidnapper.
- How did you find me?
- A lady gave me a postcard.
I got the town. The old boy
in the store told me the rest.
I bought this coat there.
Do you like it?
Emily is impetuous.
She does things without thinking.
- It's characteristic of the young.
- I didn't do what she said I did.
I never touched her,
and she never touched me.
Maybe it's my military background
or my father's strong discipline, -
- but I've always approached duty
with blind obedience. I deliver.
I don't confuse a particular task
with the big picture.
- Give me a break.
- I must find Emily.
- She's at the Red Cloud Motel.
- Good, let's go.
You can find it yourself.
Put that bag down!
- That's insurance.
- Put the bag down.
Put your shoes on. Take your coat.
You'll freeze your ass off outside.
Come on.
You okay, miss? The night clerk
said your boyfriend left.
Checkout time is... noon time.
