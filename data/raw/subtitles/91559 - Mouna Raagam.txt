Where's father?
Is that Divya?
Good morning father.
Have you showered?
- Yes I have!
- Shut up!
Lying on Friday morning?
Scolding me on Friday morning?
Watch your father scold!
Don't yell! You'll get me into trouble!
I don't know what to do!
Let me tell you - make me a cup of strong coffee!
Just half a cup? A quarter?
Just a little bit?
Wash your face and come.
My dearest mother!
Just one kiss!
Don't touch me yet! Go and wash up!
You still haven't bathed?!
Scream! And I will kill you! Understood?
I'll take off my hand and you
mustn't say a word!
Daddy! Divya still hasn't
showered!
Someone might see us!
Why did you slip away in the morning?
Your sister might see!
I have every right to hug my dearest wife!
Why are you so wet?
That's... water!
I am asking you why?
That is... outside...
Rain, isn't it?
Yes. No... no!
Get moving!
You're blushing!
"I have every right to hug my dearest wife!"
You still haven't bathed?
Don't worry; I have avoided father.
I have no responsibility; I lie,
am lazy and talk back to elders.
I set a bad example. I will only
prosper when I listen to elders.
Is that all for today or is there
more?
Go and take your shower and
get ready.
What happened to him?
Why are you quiet?
Waiting for you to get to the topic.
What do you want to tell?
How do you know?
Everyone has been nice to me
the whole morning. Something is up!
We have a prospective groom
coming over this evening.
The groom is Chandra Kumar,
a personnel manager.
He's a great match for you! I
will be lucky if this works.
You must be home at 2 p..m.
Exactly.
Why be so upset? Agree if you
like him or reject him otherwise!
I'd be in a good mood if it
were me!
Now it's this spectacle. Next
thing, they will make me marry him!
- Marry him he's fine.
- I can't marry one whom I barely know!
- I'd rather be alone.
- What are you going to do?
I don't know.
You're not in my plight!
- What if there isn't a bride?
- What are you saying?
- What if I don't go home?
- Are you kidding?
- I am not going to go!
- You sound like a kid!
I am not going to go!
- Has the groom left?
- I've spoilt you too much!
Is your husband yelling? I'll
calm him down. Have they eaten all of it?
Speak softly!
I am...
I've spoilt you too much!
Do you know they waited since 5 p..m.?
She has played like a kid and returned!
Take this off; it looks mad!
They're nice so they waited for
so long!
Should have been strict
before! He wanted to talk to you alone!
Talk to him nicely for what
you did.
Sit down.
You wanted to talk to me but I
have to talk to you first.
I won't apologise for being late
as I don't feel it was wrong.
I don't like this ceremony; it's
like buying cattle in the market.
Father didn't understand this.
I didn't mean to insult you.
They would have sung you my
praises but I am not like that.
I have many flaws. Anger,
stubbornness, arrogance, ego. All of it.
I'm not responsible and I
don't care. I want you to know this.
I don't think I'll make a good
wife. Do you have anything to say?
I like you a lot.
He's agreed!
He likes you a lot!
- I am so very happy!
- Didn't I tell you so?
- Hows the groom?
- I like him a lot.
I like him too!
He's well educated!
He's submitted a thesis!
I've started calling him brother-in-law!
He was so patient.
So were his relatives.
He's ideal for her.
That's why I've given my consent!
Hold the wedding during
school days; then I can skip school!
We need to fix a date soon.
Looks like they're in a rush!
He would have taken her with
him if he could!
You should have seen the joy
on mother's face!
We have yet to ask Divya her
consent.
Do you like him?
I don't.
Disregard her!
What fault did you find with him?
He's so intelligent.
He said he liked you!
You don't like good things!
He's a manager at such a young age!
- Say you like him!
- Why don't you like him?
- I just don't like it.
- I think he's great choice.
Then you can marry him!
Why do you say no?
- I don't want marriage now.
- Don't talk like a kid!
Then treat me like an adult
and respect my wishes. I don't want this now.
When will you marry then?
When I feel like it!
You will want it at 55.
I want to study.
Marry and study!
I'll study and then marry!
We can't get such a good place
then.
I will retire soon and you still
have 2 sisters. I can't do as you wish for.
The groom is good and they
didn't ask for any dowry. It's the best.
Are you selling me off? One
says he doesn't want dowry and you...
Can you please send it?
What happened here?
Father had a heart attack.
His pressure is high. Just give
him the medication. We'll see tomorrow.
Aren't you happy now?
I've never asked anyone for
anything. I am asking you now.
Let my husband live. Your
father has his heart set on this marriage.
I beg of you!
You're up so early.
I will marry him.
Really? Look at me and say it.
Come here.
Did you agree for my sake?
I know everything you do is for my good.
What are you doing here? The
groom is waiting for you.
- What do you mean?
- I don't like this.
- Don't talk nonsense.
- I don't even know him. How do I...
He's married you.
So? Would you have sent me to him earlier?
Wipe you tears and come.
I don't want this. Please.
Listen to me.
Auntie, let me bring her in.
Come here.
What happened?
I need to sleep.
Why cry for that? You could have told me.
- I'm telling you now.
- Go ahead and sleep.
He's Sanjit Singh. A very nice
man.
I don't understand a word
you're saying!
If my mom was here the
reception will be different.
I am everything around here.
The only thing lacking was a
mistress for the house. That's solved.
This is where the provisions
are. There's a shop around here.
These are the house keys.
Take them.
My loves before marriage
were books and music.
This is your room. Do you like
it?
It's up to you to make this
house a home.
I only need a house.
Do you treat this as an office
or a playground?
Keep your apologies!
I told them not to do this!
I am asking about why you're
back so early?
Is this why you called?
Answer my question!
- Working.
- Nonsense. Have you heard of "honeymoon"?
There's union negotiations.
We should blame the girl's father!
You should take care of your
wife if you want things to be good!
Go out with her and praise her
to the skies! Then watch!
Can I go to my work now?
Who's the MD here?
It's you.
Sit down.
Get her a gift that she wants
willingly and things will be good.
My wife does everything I tell
her to!
Why so long to answer?
"My wife does everything I tell her to!"
Go and do your work!
Are you talking to your secretary?!
What did you say?
Shut your mouth!
Telling me to keep quiet?
No not you! Shut your mouth!
Telling me aren't you?!
No, not you! Someone else!
You devil! Get lost!
Calling me a devil?! I'll deal with you later!
Look at my time.
I wonder what she's going to do later.
Can I ask you something?
Why did you marry me?
I said so much the other day
and yet you married me.
I liked you a lot.
I was forced to come and
wanted to tell you that I was not interested.
But after I heard you talk, I
liked you and agreed.
- Are you happy with this?
- No.
A newborn kid cries because
the environment is alien to them.
Your situation is similar and
I will wait till things change for you.
Why have you stopped?
Touch one of my fingers.
I can't decide between a saree
and jewelry for you.
I don't want anything.
I want to get you something.
I don't want anything.
Ask for anything you want.
Will you get me anything?
If it is within my capacity, yes.
I want a divorce. Can you buy
it in this shop?
Deal with this later. Tell me
what happened yesterday.
Did you ask what she likes?
Yes.
What did she say?
She wanted a divorce.
Shall I get it for her?
Drink it!
One minute.
Please leave my hand.
I need to talk to you.
Leave my hand and talk.
Are you scared?
It's not fear; I don't like it. I beg of you.
Why not?
I just don't like it.
You don't like my touch?
No! It feels like bugs are crawling on me!
What's this?
A small gift.
I told you I didn't want it!
I felt it was necessary!
Aren't you opening it?
No!
If I force you?
I'm not required to obey you!
- I tied your thali!
- This is just a string in my opinion!
- The world begs to differ.
- But in my opinion, I am still not your wife!
Why?
I can't accept you as my husband!
- Why?
- My heart is not with me!
Who's the MP's son?
Is it you?
What's the trouble here? Who
are they?
Tell me what you saw!
I just came and I don't know anything.
Not one person has the guts to
talk! Can anyone identify them?
I can identify them!
It was him.
Stealing from the MP's son?
Where's the money? Tell me!
- Are you happy now?
- He stole in broad daylight!
- Don't curse him like that,
- Come with me.
The MP's son hit my child and
just left from the spot.
My kid is alive because of
Manohar and you got him into custody!
The money was for her
operation. Take this and bail him out!
Use this for the operation. I
will bail him out.
She's the one who got him into
trouble and she's here now.
Can you pawn this and get me
money to bail him?
You identified him and now
you want to bail him.
Where do I sign?
Here. I will bring him in again!
Drag him out!
Divya's father is not well. Can
I take her with me?
What happened to my father?
When?
This morning. The auto hit him.
Where?
Vanimahal!
- Bad hit!
- Were you there?
- I sent him to hospital.
- Which hospital?
- General Hospital.
- Here or out of town.
- Here. Why?
- My dad's in Koimbature and not back!
He's in Koiambature? Then,
could it be your grandfather?
My grandfather died before I
was born.
Our score was settled when I
had brought you out on bail.
Tomorrow you'll tell me I'm
pretty and then that you like me!
I don't like this!
I came to return this. But after
you talked, I understand.
What?
That you're pretty and I like you!
Looking for me?
Don't lie. Tell me the truth.
No.
Promise me.
I won't.
Then you were looking for me.
No!
I won't leave till you admit it!
The bus will leave.
No! My bike is blocking its path.
Go and take your bike!
I won't till you admit it!
There's a traffic jam!
Please take your bike!
Admit it.
Yes. I was looking for you.
One minute. Come here. Repeat it.
What to say?
Say it. Or I won't leave.
Yes. I was looking for you.
Fine! Meet me at 4 p.m. Tomorrow.
No!
At four o' clock.
You said you won't come but
you waited an hour.
I wanted to tell you to stop
harassing me.
Want some nuts?
You're scared of me. Scared
that you might fall for me.
Prove it otherwise.
How?
What is this?
What does that mean?
This has nothing to do with
hooliganism.
I don't fight now. I just steal.
Big thefts.
Ask me what I stole.
What did you steal?
Your heart.
"In the heat of blushing, she
says thanks."
Thanks. For the coffee.
What happened?
My father.
Where?
Next to the counter.
The bald one?
Yes!
What's his name?
Chandramouli.
Mr Chandramouli! Please
come over!
Good evening.
Good evening. You are?
Come join us.
No, I've eaten.
Just a little coffee?
No I've had.
Wait! Come over!
I have to leave.
The next time, you must join
us.
What are you doing here?
Security will chase you out!
No! I've bribed him!
What do you want?
I need to talk to you.
Can't you do it elsewhere?
No.
What if someone sees?
I've told them all to read!
Fine! Tell me!
What do you say?
Gather everyone and say it on
the mike! Then I'll answer!
Is this your answer?
Yes!
You told me to do this and I
can't reject your request.
So, I am in the principal's
room speaking over the intercom.
The police have blockades.
Then that's a fight for sure!
- Where do we meet? When?
- At nine.
I'll be there at nine.
- Can you do something?
- I know what you want.
You don't want me to go? I
can't give up my principles for you!
There's no harm changing.
I like you but can't conform to you!
I'm asking you to consider.
I have and I can't.
Your Love is pointless then.
These are 2 different things.
Why not?! I can't spend my
Life wondering where you will be!
I will go tonight!
Then, leave me!
You have to choose between
this and me.
Didn't go?
Because of me?
Not that. I just didn't want a
young kid to have heartbreak.
Is that enough?
What else?
- It was such a big deal!
- Do you want me to marry you for it?
- That sounds more fair.
- Are you kidding?
- No.
- It'll be the end if my father finds out.
Don't Let him know then.
You're always joking.
- No. I really wish to marry you.
- I want to spend my Life with you.
- But my parents...
- We like each other. What more do we need?
- But without their consent...
- Fine. Let's ask them!
- Marry me tomorrow at 10.
- Tomorrow?!
- I can't.
- Then, I'll ask him!
Then agree! Tomorrow
morning at 10 at the Registrar's office.
What do you mean?
If you don't come, it means
you don't Love me.
If you don't come?
Then, I don't Love you!
But tomorrow morning I will be there. Ok? Bye.
Can you come to the police station with me?
Why?
Yesterday's acts Landed 4
officers in hospital and a lot of Losses.
I was not involved.
Come to the station and say it.
You can ask anyone! I wasn't
there yesterday!
Can we go now?
I said I am not involved!
You'd better come!
I will!
I will but tomorrow.
Go tell a fool that!
Just for today!
Not possible! Just come!
One minute!
Aren't you going to open this?
I've said so much but this is
still important! I need to open it right?!
Divorce papers.
One's what you wanted; the
other's what I chose.
After Listening to you today, I
see the justification.
I have no concerns about your
past. I wish to share your future.
If you think there's a chance,
take my gift. Or, sign the papers.

I will accept whatever you
decide.
Which of you wants this?
Both of us.
What's the difference?
Nothing, just no similarities.
Must you get a divorce?
We thought we should.
You may change Later.
Don't you want this case?
How many years together?
Seven days.
Decided to part so soon?
It's not a matter of time.
You must be married for at
Least one year before Legally separating.
The Law has faith in your
marriage though you may not.
You have to tolerate each
other for another year.
Do you still want it?
Yes, please do it for us. We've decided.
Can I talk to her alone?
I don't have the heart to get
this divorce for you.
Don't be hasty. A woman has
it difficult without her husband.
I'm suffering that now and
don't want that for you.
I will file this for you
tomorrow.
I shouldn't have done that.
I wanted to come back but...
I am sorry.
It's my fault to have forgotten about them.
I can tell that this must be
terrible after applying for a divorce.
What will they all think about
me? They're your colleagues too.
I won't do this again. I will
change myself.
Don't change yourself for me.
You'll only be here for a year.
This is your room. Here's the
key.
You can be as you choose. I
won't interfere in your Life.
Aren't you angry with me at
all?
I want to divorce my wife as
she keeps changing my secretaries.
Ask me if you need to know
about it.
As if you're experienced.
We just filed for it yesterday.
Are you joking?
We will spend the next year
together but Live separate Lives.
You want to Live separately
after marriage. I don't understand this.
Don't you like Leaving Tamil
alone?
You just want to Learn? I will
teach you!
I will teach only four words to
amaze him!
"Come over you fool!"
You tell him "Sit down, you
Lazy bum!"
"Shut up fellow!"
"Get Lost!"
You could have at Least tasted
my coffee right?
I took so much effort to do it
but you didn't try it at all.
If I get used to this now, I will
suffer when you leave next year.
Come over you fool!
Fool? This is a bad start!
Sit down, you Lazy bum!
Lazy bum? My respect is decreasing!
If anyone hears this, it is the
end of me.
I treasure this more than my
wife so be careful.
Shut up fellow!
Don't yell! My driver can hear you!
Just take the key and do your
job! Spare me.
Get Lost! Get Lost!
I've never been so insulted!
Can you come early today?
Why?
You've tolerated me for 30
days and I wanted to cook you a good meal.
Yesterday it's Little Late
Fault is mine
You never drink coffee made by me
The same to food also
There is an unexpected problem in the office
I have to suspend an operator
Yes, there is a Lot of work for you
No time to spare for your wife or make a call
You make it yourselves
No need to compromise
You do it yourselves
One min it's a black coffee
I will drink it in the afternoon
So there is no sugar

Have you seen all the places here
Oh railway station, this house
Want a sight seeing now
No need to console me

Then make a call
Fast! Fast! - OK

but never mind. Thank you.
Get lost!
I'm coming. Open the door.
The food is ready.
I've cooked such that you need
guts or hunger to eat it.
Aren't you eating?
I'll eat if nothing happens to you first.
Let me feed you.
You won't burn if I touch you.
But you'd feel as if bugs are
crawling on you.
Where are you going?
To the office?
The doctor told you to rest for
a fortnight. Are you Listening to me?
You can't even wear your
shoes. Don't just ignore me!
I won't give that. Even if you don't listen to the doctor
Atleast listen to me.
You tied my thali! At Least
Listen for that!
To us, it's just a yellow string!
Go ahead and get your bones
broken! Why do I care?
Do you know what it means?
The one born to a donkey!
That means mad dog! I Learnt
a few words just to scold you!
That means mad man!
Shut your mouth! Get moving!
You haven't paid me.
Wrongful person.
How are you both?
Why the sudden visit?
I had some work here and she
wanted to see you too.
Come in. Sit down. I will go
and get him.
Come down! My parents are
here!
Come and welcome them.
Aren't they here already? How am I suppose to welcome them?
I'm going to the office after coffee. with them
Take leave for a day please.
They come here to bug!
Don't yell. They might hear you.
Let them hear! At Least then
they might understand!
He'll be here shortly.
Hows everyone at home?
I think of you all at Least a
hundred times each day!
Probably father can't find
anyone to scold everyday!
Are you happy?
Let me make you coffee.
It's okay. Let me do it.
You mustn't cook while you're
here! Leave it to me!
How are you?
I'll be Late for work.
Not having breakfast?
I don't want it.
There's a lot.
I said I don't want it.
You wanted go somewhere.
I'll go on my own.
He was moody because of a
headache. Otherwise he's very nice to me.
He treats me like a queen!
Believe me!
Then, why are the beds
separate?
It's normal to fight but not to
have separate beds.
I don't know what the
problem but you should give in a bit.
Your father's here. Wipe you
tears.
Is your work over?
Yes. Here!
What's this?
Train tickets for this evening.
Evening?
My job's over so I am Leaving.
I take leave.
Forgive me if I had done
something wrong at your wedding.
I will rectify it but don't make
my daughter cry.
You had not right to vent your
anger on them!
You could have at Least
respected their age!
If I am nice, they might blame
you for everything at the year end.
Now, they don't think much of
me and will accept you happily.
- I've got something to show.
- I'm busy. Don't disturb me.
I am just asking for one
minute.
You behave so childishly!
Don't you understand?! Leave this place!
Do you want me to leave this
place or the house?
Both!
Then send me to Madras!
Go ahead!
Then arrange for my ticket!
Did Divya come here?
Give it to me. I'll put it on.
Your train ticket.
What should I do?
"Tell me not to leave once and
I will never leave you."
"Tell me you won't leave once
and I will never let go of you."
Should I leave or not?
Your choice. Do what feels right.
I want your opinion.
Your decision has nothing to do with me.
Do we something together?
I don't know. You asked if a thali was all.
This is all the house accounts.
This is the store room key.
There's enough provision for 2 months.
This is from the allowance.
Your passbook, cheque book and key.
I've said everything. Do you
have anything to add?
I'll pick you up at 2 for the
train.
You don't have to come for
me. I'll go on my own.
Here's the first thing you
asked for. I wanted to give it to you.
Divorce.
It came this morning. The law
has decided we have nothing together.
Does your heart say so? This
paper can't change our hearts!
I can bear you not liking me
but you like me; you won't admit it!
I will admit it. I love you
wholeheartedly!
If you feel the same way about
me, I'll be waiting for you.
Till then, keep this in my
memory!
"I will admit it. I love you
wholeheartedly!"
