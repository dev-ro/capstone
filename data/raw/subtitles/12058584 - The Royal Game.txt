White bishop e2 to e4.
Black knight e7 to f6.
Black pawn c4 to c3.
White queen e2 to g4.
Good luck.
Keep moving.
Next! Passport!
Safe journey,
Mr. van Leuwen.
Passport!
Josef.
Not exactly a palace, but...
it's only for a few days.
Josef?
Remember?
Did you leave
your elegant mustache in Austria?
I need to get used to it.
But you look great.
And that scar above your brow,
that's new, too.
You didn't have that before.
It makes you look like a gangster.
Did they beat you?
I'm so glad I got you back.
Would you like me
to change your tablecloth?
I brushed up on my English.
So we won't starve.
Shall we have a toast?
To our new life.
That's what you say.
I'll buy you a new watch
once we're over there.
Everything will be like it used to,
I promise.
How was it?
How was what?
How was it back then?
It was lovely.
Really, really lovely.
-Good morning.
-Morning.
-Thanks.
-Have a nice day.
God, it's busy today.
VIENNA DAILY NEWS
NO UNION WITH HITLER'S GERMANY!
REFERENDUM
Yes, hello?
I already told you.
He's still not available.
As soon as...
You're wanted on the telephone again.
"And all the pushing, all the striving,
is endless peace in God the Lord."
Old Goethe got it right.
Such pompous talk
isn't for people like me.
You're reading too much.
Without this food for thought
I would starve, my dear Klara.
Thank you.
Take Sunday off, and same goes
for Max and the others.
Go and vote in the referendum,
we don't want to become German.
God, no.
But my cousin says
there's lots of jobs in Germany.
Except for the Jews,
whose shop windows are smashed.
-Terrible.
-Yes.
I'll tell the others.
What are we to tell people
calling on the phone?
Let's just tell them
I'm suffering from influenza,
how does that sound?
Contagious.
Darling,
the new Staatsoper production
of Swan Lake
is supposed to be outstanding.
"More than moving,"
writes the reviewer.
You're surprisingly jolly for a sick man.
That's due to my medication.
It'll turn into poison
if you don't get up now.
Josef...
Come on, it's time.
But time for what?
Can't we be punctual for once?
Back in Hungary,
my parents used to say
"punctuality gets in the way
of a good time."
Oh, those Hungarians...
What do you think?
These... or these?
Your beauty elevates any jewelry.
Heil Hitler!
We need to get rid of Schuschnigg.
There are even more of them today.
It feels like the whole world
has gone crazy.
The whole drama will be over on Sunday.
Bastards!
-Get lost!
-What are you? A clairvoyant?
No, just an avid newspaper reader.
DOWN WITH GLOBAL MONEY!
Down with Schuschnigg!
DEATH TO JEWS!
Scum!
I'm glad your father's no longer here
to witness this.
They need someone to blame
for their hunger.
I hope your newspapers are right.
Get your hands off, you bastards.
Hands off!
We're nearly through.
Wrong!
You know what I think, darling?
As long as Vienna keeps dancing,
the world can't end.
I'm afraid this is no joke.
I got another one.
-Joseph Goebbels...
-You're killing us, Fink.
Joseph Goebbels
is addressing the party conference.
"The German nation
is like the German eagle.
"Our Führer is the head,
the SS the right wing,
the SA the left wing!"
Suddenly, a worker right at the back
gets up and shouts,
"And you are the asshole!"
What's wrong, Swoboda?
Lost your humor on your trip to Germany?
I can't condone laughter
when my country is suffering.
Don't be so serious, Swoboda,
laughing is good for you.
Yes, it's true, you know.
Dr. Freud has proven the benefits
of humor beyond a doubt.
Vienna survived the Turks,
it'll survive the Germans too.
If you'll excuse me.
Swoboda... Swoboda!
Your coffee, sir.
OUTSIDE. NOW.
G.S.
Gustl.
Who do you think you are?
The goddamn Chinese Emperor?
Just having a little fun.
You picked the wrong day.
Were you followed?
Followed? Sure.
By a short guy with a funny mustache
and a parting like this.
Josef, please.
Enough of your jokes.
The referendum is off,
the troops are coming tonight.
What?
It's chaos at the ministry.
Are you sure?
That's not what the papers are saying.
In case you're still wondering
if the world will simply watch our demise,
France and England
are doing what you did today,
they just won't pick up the phone.
-Anna and you must leave the country.
-Come on now--
Immediately.
You're on their list.
That's nonsense.
How would they know about me?
We don't know.
But one thing's for certain...
They have people everywhere.
And apparently they got a good idea
about what you've been doing.
What does that mean?
It means they have
a good idea about it.
You have two hours.
Take the midnight train to Rotterdam
and then the boat to New York.
-Got it?
-Come on now.
Say yes, Josef.
Say it!
Goodbye.
Gustl, please don't be mad at me.
I know you mean well.
But I'll go back in,
have a dance with Anna,
we'll go home,
have a bottle of champagne
and quietly see out a lovely evening.
It can't be all that bad.
They'll have to obey the law here.
The law?
They beat the brains out of people
to make them talk.
They hang them up on meat hooks!
You know I have a hard head.
You still think this is all a joke, right?
Your clothes, only what's essential.
The cash from the safe,
you know the combination.
The jewelry,
but only what we can sell.
-Why sell?
-In case they freeze the accounts.
Are you mad?
Why would they bother a notary?
Look at me.
I'll explain it to you.
But not now.
All right, then...
I'll meet you at the station.
Max, please...
You can count on me.
If I don't make it by midnight,
you leave on that train without me.
I hate you.
BARTOK & SON
NOTARIES PUBLIC
DR. JOSEF BARTOK
2ND FLOOR
GOLD
MORTGAGE BOND
MONETARY TRANSFER
3,000 FRANCS
We interrupt our broadcast
from the Vienna Opera House
for an urgent statement
by Chancellor Schuschnigg.
Dear fellow Austrians,
today has seen us face
a difficult situation.
Adolf Hitler and the German government
have sent Austria an ultimatum
according to which, by tonight,
we must appoint a National Socialist
candidate suggested to us
to be the new Chancellor.
Should we fail to comply,
German troops would invade Austria
this very night,
instigating a war of aggression.
I would like to state to the world
that recent news spread about Austria,
claiming the government had relinquished
its authority over several regions
and was no longer in control,
are entirely fabricated
and merely reflect
deliberate German propaganda.
On behalf of our Federal President,
I announce to the Austrian nation
in this fateful hour
that we cede to the aggression
to prevent a war and senseless bloodshed.
We have therefore instructed
the Austrian military
to withdraw,
offering no resistance
and fully surrender
to the German Wehrmacht.
I bid my farewell
to the Austrian people at this time
expressing my heartfelt wish,
God protect Austria.
Be quiet!
Put the fire out.
Take what's left of the documents.
Too scared to jump, Mr. Notary?
Who are you?
What do you want from me?
What are you trying to achieve
with this little kidnapping?
Open the window
and let in some fresh air, Manni.
Our weakling is about to faint.
And you relax and enjoy the view.
It's not every day
you ride in a car like this.
Ah, the Metropole.
Our guests only get the best.
Well, what do you know?
We got good taste, too.
-Leave me in peace.
-Please follow me...
You can't just throw us out like this.
You're preparing the single rooms
on the upper floors.
The single rooms
for the special treatment.
We'll keep hold
of your personal belongings.
ARREST RECORD
ARRESTED 3/11/1938
Including the watch.
Seize them.
And your ring.
Thank you.
Fingerprints.
Why the indignant face?
Well, who have we here?
Someone once told me
laughing is good for you.
"The mask comes off to reveal the human."
Although I'm not sure about you.
Let's see what's left of you
once we're through with you,
Mr. Notary.
Mr. Notary, you too?
How could I miss out on this soirée?
Have you heard this one?
Why do German dentists
extract through the nose now?
Why?
Because everyone
must keep their mouths shut.
Do you play?
Excuse me?
Chess. Do you play chess?
Us Viennese like music,
great literature,
beautiful women,
exquisite food.
Chess is a pastime
for bored Prussian generals.
This unique combination of...
charm and arrogance.
I love this city.
You know what I like about chess?
It's about grinding down
your opponent's ego.
You like scotch?
If it's a good one.
This hotel only serves
the finest quality, Dr. Bartok.
Thank you for accepting my,
admittedly rather forceful, invitation.
Don't mention it.
How can I help you, Mr...
Böhm. Franz Josef Böhm.
German Secret Police,
Vienna Office.
Are you able to surmise
why I sought your acquaintance
so urgently?
I don't know.
I'm a notary,
maybe you want me to certify
a hotel takeover?
That won't be necessary.
The Rosenthal family were kind enough
to let us use the building.
Help yourself.
This is your preferred brand, isn't it?
I must admit your cheap magic tricks
are starting to bore me.
Your clerk Mr. Leitner
kindly informed us about your habits.
I see. Mr. Leitner.
He stopped working for me
four months ago.
He was an extremely unreliable employee.
That's a surprise.
He was very reliable informing us...
about the real purpose
of your humble office.
The huge financial assets
of the old Austrian nobility,
discreetly managed
by you and your late father.
That's...
-That's crazy.
-Yes, it is.
As of tonight, these assets are
the property of the Greater German Reich.
It's your duty
as a new citizen of this Reich
to tell me where they are.
I'm afraid I have no idea
what you're talking about.
That's a shame.
I'd hoped you'd save us the trouble
of sifting through
all the half-burned documents
we found at your office.
I'm sorry I can't help you with this.
If you'll excuse me now?
Of course.
I love the "Emperor Waltz."
Did you know this glorious piece is
dedicated to Austro-Prussian friendship?
No.
You could say to our friendship.
-I'm not your friend.
-I know. I know.
But you will be.
Fine.
Dr. Bartok will receive
the special treatment.
That sounds elitist somehow.
Welcome to the Metropole Hotel,
Mr. Notary.
I wish you a pleasant stay.
Dr. Josef Bartok.
Down with those rags.
Room 402.
What is it?
Nothing.
Just a bad dream.
Hardly surprising.
Try and go back to sleep.
I wish I could forget it all, but I can't.
It will fade, eventually.
Yes, maybe.
Well, you know...
no one will stop us
from being happy again.
No one.
In America,
it doesn't matter so much...
who you were
or who you are.
All that matters
is who you want to be.
So...
who do you want to be?
How am I supposed to know, Anna?
I don't even know who I was anymore.
Good evening.
Scotch, please.
Do you have any others?
Of course.
We stock over 20 different brands.
Is there a particular one you like?
-Sir?
-Actually, it's fine.
Yes?
Hello?
Can anyone hear me?
Open the door! Hello?
Hello!
How much longer
is this going to last?
Tell me, o Muse,
of that sagacious man
who, having overthrown
the sacred town of Ilium, wandered far...
...and visited many nations,
learned the customs of their dwellers
and endured great suffering
on the deep sea...
Hello.
Greetings, young man.
How are you today?
I'm fine.
What's on the menu today?
Let me guess, it'll be soup.
Am I right?
It's gotten warm in here.
Feels like summer has arrived.
What's your name?
Erich.
You could very well be called Erich.
Is that your name? Erich?
Tell me, Erich,
you wouldn't have
a newspaper for me?
Or a small book?
Anything, I'll take anything.
Maybe you could
arrange something, Erich?
Erich?
I hope you're enjoying
your stay with us?
Thanks for asking.
It really is a first-class establishment.
Makes you not want to leave again.
Glad to hear you haven't lost
your charming demeanor.
Cigarette?
You've got plenty of them.
Managed to get enough rest?
For thinking things over?
The tranquility has been exquisite.
Wonderful.
We can get to work then.
We've now had a closer look
at all the files from your office.
The assets entrusted to you are kept
in numbered accounts
in several European countries.
-Interesting.
-Isn't it?
Unfortunately,
the numbers and codes
to access these accounts
are missing.
They're almost completely burned.
Oh...
So this would mean
the money's lost forever?
Exactly.
Unless,
the codes are stored
in here.
That's absurd.
I don't get it.
It's not even your money.
Do you seriously think the people
whose large assets you're protecting
would do the same for you?
Let's assume
these assets really existed...
and I memorized the codes.
Presumably,
this would be enough money...
-that both of us would be rich men?
-What are you trying to say?
I'm after a consensus.
So this is an offer?
You could have interpreted it that way.
Could I?
I interpret it as you thinking
a German official could be bribed.
You must have misunderstood me.
Good.
Come on.
Write down the codes.
When you're done...
we'll go to a Viennese coffee house,
and have a nice cup of coffee.
Afterwards, I'll drive you home...
and I promise you,
all this will seem
like a fleeting vision to you.
Here you go.
"Now proceed, and sing
the invention of the wooden horse
"made by Epeius with Minerva's aid,
"and by the chief Ulysses artfully
conveyed into the Trojan citadel,
"with armed warriors in its womb
to lay the city to waste."
Nothing suits a gentleman more
than some western culture.
That's very kind of you to say.
Will you beat me to death now?
We don't let people die that easily.
You know why I didn't just tell them?
I knew full well,
they'd only let me live
until they'd extracted
all knowledge from me.
They're cannibals, butchers.
They snatched up
the best luxury hotel for themselves.
They wear custom suits...
and brass buttons on their uniforms.
They speak in a fancy manner,
but I saw through them.
I saw through them!
Their behavior...
it's crude and disgusting.
Their aim is destruction,
their language is violence.
Here's to Odysseus having returned home.
To "Odysseus' Return."
Anyone wants to tap glasses?
I must ask you to leave
once you've finished your drink.
Your behavior is causing a stir.
Is it?
Mr. Pharmacist!
Two doses against remembering.
-Gin?
-Please.
To sacrifice a rook
and get a checkmate in ten moves,
that's somehow obscene.
The guy's a chess machine, no doubt.
-Who's playing?
-The entire ship.
Against the chess world champion.
No! Don't...
Don't do that.
It's a trap.
If you promote the pawn to a queen,
he'll take you with bishop to c1,
and you hit back with your knight.
But then...
he advances his pawn
to d7, attacking your rook.
Even if you then check
with your knight to e2,
you'll lose.
Would you kindly see the gentleman out?
If he can remember his cabin number.
It's almost the same constellation
as Alekhine versus Bogoljubov in 1922...
Wait.
What were you saying?
It's a trap.
You advance your pawn,
he attacks your rook...
and you lose.
So what do you recommend?
You must go on the defensive.
Don't advance straight away,
avoid him at first.
Most importantly, move your king
out of danger, from g8 to h7.
He'll move the attack
to the opposite flank,
but you counter with your rook
from c8 to c4.
That'll cost him two moves,
one pawn and the upper hand.
Then it's one passed pawn
against another,
and you get a draw.
That's the best you can do.
I didn't understand a word,
but it sounded somehow professional.
Does anyone still follow?
All right, then.
We're losing anyhow.
King from g8 to h7?
g8 - h7.
Gentlemen, please.
A draw?
We forced a draw
against the world champion.
Champagne for all!
There he is!
The man who beat
the chess world champion.
We've been looking everywhere for you.
I didn't beat him.
You're too modest.
Come inside and let us celebrate you.
Owen McConnor.
I own this steel gondola.
-And you are?
-Max van Leuwen.
A votre santé, Max.
You know, I once read somewhere
that chess is 90 percent psychology.
Is that right?
Apparently it's mainly about
grinding down your opponent's ego.
You definitely managed to do that
with this guy.
You reduced him to this,
including his hat.
Where do you normally play?
Nowhere.
How many tournaments have you won?
None.
I just...
touched a chess piece
for the first time in my life.
"endured...
"endured great suffering...
"great suffering...
"of that...
"of that sagacious...
"of that sagacious man
wandered far...
"having overthrown
the sacred town of Ilium...
"many nations...
great... great suffering...
but where..."
Balzac, Kleist, the Opera Guide?
They all go to the party library.
Heine?
In the basket for burning.
-Mann?
-In the basket.
-Hello.
-There are several.
-Still here?
-Burn them all.
Ah, Dr. Bartok.
I'm so glad you've finally come to see me.
Please, do come in.
-I have to get out.
-Stop!
Hold him.
Hold him!
That's gruesome.
It'll be goulash on the menu tonight.
That's uncalled for.
-Fridl?
-Yes?
I'll take care of the mess down there.
-What happened?
-You can prepare all the paperwork.
Release document,
death certificate and so on.
Yes, sir.
What about the notary?
We're in no rush.
Back to his room.
Thank you, Erich.
1. e2 - e4.
e7 - e5.
2. g1 - f3.
b8 - c6.
They begin, first move,
e2 - e4.
Black moves e7 - e5.
Knight g1 - f3...
16 pieces in two rows, so eight.
Eight times eight, 64 squares.
64. 16 pieces, two rows.
64 squares. Knight.
Knight, bishop.
Queen, king.
Knight g1 - f3,
knight b8 - c6.
f1 - b5.
a7 - a6.
e7 captures c6.
So it captures 6.
Knight b1 - c3.
Bishop f8 - e6.
c6 - c5.
c8 - c6.
Bishop c1 - c3.
d7 captures c6.
So white... captures 6.
Knight b1 - c3.
Now black loses the rook,
and white the pawn.
What does black do now?
What does black do now?
Please show the notary in.
We'll see him now.
Fridl, a coffee for our guest, please.
-Coming up.
-Thank you.
As you can see, Mr. Notary,
I've picked up local customs
during the months you've been with us.
You didn't even know.
Am I right?
How long have I been here?
60 days. Six months. A year.
As you can tell, our special treatment
makes time and space disappear.
Puff...
And all this
without laying a finger on you.
-Impressive.
-Isn't it?
But what really matters is
that you're able to leave today.
You're almost through this.
-Thanks a lot.
-You're welcome.
If you'd quickly fetch your notepad
to take down Dr. Bartok's statement,
you'd really make me a happy man.
Of course, right away.
Thank you.
Smells like the outside world, doesn't it?
Cigarette?
-I've given up.
-Commendable.
Let's get this over with.
Banque Savigny, Vaduz.
According to our findings,
two separate accounts are held there,
both with you as a signatory.
If you'd be kind enough
to tell us the access codes?
-I got nothing to say.
-Excuse me?
The special treatment
makes time and space disappear.
Puff...
And it's all gone.
I'm desolate.
A few days ago,
you had much better intentions.
That was commendable of me.
But I can't even remember that.
You do realize, Dr. Bartok,
you'll only leave this place
if you help us.
I want to go back to my room.
Fridl, what can this be?
Maybe...
I just enjoy staying here.
In your beautiful hotel.
Thank you for the coffee.
Anna?
You're booked into a single berth cabin.
That can't be right.
It's...
Come on, that's absurd.
See for yourself.
There you go.
Your wife isn't even
on the passenger list.
There... that's him.
The dining room isn't open yet.
You... you were serving us.
My wife and I had a table up there.
My wife was sitting opposite me.
You served us red wine
and spilled a little when you poured it.
You remember?
You see?
I asked if you wanted
the tablecloth changed.
You said it wasn't necessary.
No, my wife,
it was my wife who said that.
You dined on your own.
Shall I get a doctor?
No, thanks, that won't be necessary.
It was...
maybe a little too much
of that good scotch.
-What's this?
-Just a mild sedative.
To calm you down.
It'll send you to sleep.
Sleep.
Looks like check.
So, what does black do now?
What is black going to do?
King to d6.
Then black loses the rook
and the king moves to...
Did we interrupt you taking a shit?
I'm so sorry.
Look at that.
So this is punishment?
Marvelous.
You got it nice in here.
Even a bathtub.
Ironed laundry...
And you got a bed.
Is it soft?
Is it soft, asshole?
Now listen,
I don't give a damn if you talk.
If it was up to me,
I'd stick you on a meat hook
and let you bleed dry.
Running water.
You can go, I'll handle this.
It's all right, you can go.
I brought you something.
Because everything
works better with music.
So you're a solicitor.
I know what solicitors do.
You draw up contracts.
You know about the law,
and you know the paragraphs
that circumvent the law.
You can bend it
any way you want, right?
But the law has changed.
You guys are the dirt now.
And we're the cleaning squad.
No solicitors, no business.
Because you need contracts
to do business.
That's what they're like,
the high society.
I busted my ass for you in the war.
And where were you? At home.
Drinking coffee, going for a stroll.
Gazing at the shop windows
of your faggot stores.
-I'm sorry.
-Shut up!
So you're sorry?
I'm your judge now.
There you are.
Where were you?
I was worried about...
Shit!
Let's get him out!
Prantl, move!
Careful.
Come back. Bartok.
Come back.
Breathe. That's it.
Breathe, breathe...
Easy now.
There's no dying without my permission.
Did you hear me, Prantl?
No one said to kill him.
I thought...
You thought?
Leave the thinking to me,
it's not your strength. Thank you.
Easy...
Easy.
How did this get in here?
How did this get in here?
Do you have any idea
what this is about?
Please! Not my book!
No. Please! Please!
No!
Please don't!
No! Please. Please!
Fascinating how resourceful
man becomes
when faced with hardship.
I thought you said chess was only
for bored Prussian generals.
Please don't.
Please don't.
No.
No.
Please, my book!
We shall continue.
From now on without your dirty tricks.
No. Please!
Please...
Not my book. Please.
Come now, Bartok.
Where's it gone,
your dignity?
Are you up early or late?
To be honest, I...
I'm not sure.
Could be the scotch.
That was impressive
for an amateur the other night.
Respect.
We're hoping for a rematch.
Must be a lucrative business.
People are starved of entertainment
on these long crossings.
Strange, you'd think he'd have something
better to do at this time of day.
Really? What else do you think
he could be doing?
I don't know,
read a book, write a letter...
Engage in lively conversation...
God help me,
he can't read or write.
His vocabulary consists
of less than a hundred words.
His language is chess.
He's illiterate?
Crazy, isn't it?
He's from one of
the poorest regions in Hungary.
His mother died giving birth to him.
His father later drowned in the Danube.
I assume he stopped talking then.
The teachers thought he was retarded
because he didn't speak.
The other kids threw mud at him.
But then, one winter's night,
it happened.
The priest was playing chess
against the police constable.
Mirko stood and watched,
and without ever having come
into contact with the game before,
he made his first move.
And?
He beat the priest and then the constable,
three times in a row.
The next day,
the priest took him to the barber,
to make him half presentable,
and traveled to the nearest
provincial town with him
where he had him play against
the best players of the local chess club.
He beat all of them too,
without any effort,
one after the other,
like an unfathomable,
ice cold,
chess machine.
The clocks on board
go back automatically.
We move against the earth's rotation.
Each degree of latitude has its own time.
Best not to think about it too much
or it'll drive you insane.
Are you feeling a bit better?
Yes.
Good.
I got something for you,
from me and my friends.
You must be very proud
or very wealthy.
I used to be both.
You know,
America is an expensive country.
It won't hurt to start out
with some travel funds.
Just one match,
you alone against Czentovic.
You'd make us all very happy.
You're looking for a circus monkey.
We're looking for a hero.
I'm going to have to disappoint you.
What have you got to lose?
More than you can imagine.
Do you actually have a choice?
You know full well...
it's either you or him.
You overestimate my powers.
Maybe because
I know you better than you think.
Tomorrow after dinner.
You'll be there.
Gustl...
What have they done to you?
The... gentlemen... and I...
just had a conversation.
Don't you want to save your friend?
You finally talk,
and the two of you go free.
Free...
Free in what sense?
Still thinking like a notary?
You'll both get out of here alive,
is what I meant.
I have your word?
Yes.
My word of honor.
That's not good enough.
-My German word of honor.
-It's worthless.
As you wish.
The decision is yours.
I can't do this, Gustl.
Yes, you can.
You're the goddamn Chinese Emperor.
Say it.
"I'm the goddamn Chinese Emperor."
Say it!
Josef!
I... am...
the goddamn Chinese...
Emperor.

a2, a3, a4, a5,
a6, a7, a8.
g2, g3, g4.
White, white...
It's just a game.
Just a game...
It's just a boat.
A boat.
Hello?
Hello!
Can anyone hear me?
Is there anyone out there?
Open up!
Open up!
Let me out!
Please let me out!
Please!
Hello!
-Hello!
-Hello?
Did you call for help?
Go. Go away.
I don't understand.
Are you sure?
No.
Please.
Please talk to me.
I am talking to you, sir.
Please let me out.
Please.
You locked yourself in,
from the inside.
What?
I'm...
I'm free?
Am I...
Am I free?
You are...
free.
Of course you are.
Thank you.
One of the generators is acting up.
Nothing to worry about.
The match.
I'm wanted in the dining room.
It may be canceled
due to rough seas.
No, the match must go ahead.
Please, take me there.
Dr. van Leuwen!
Finally!
The money.
Your money.
The barman was kind enough
to keep it for you.
We're playing for the watch on his wrist.
It's mine, he stole it from me.
Gentlemen, please!
This is absurd.
I note the amateur is playing White.
Write it down.
We don't want posterity
to miss out on this match.
Write it down.
Write it down.
Write it down.
I can announce
the opponents will be contesting
a "Spanish Game."
Mr. McConnor,
may I remind you,
it's a game of chess,
not rugby.
Drink this.
You must write it down, Bartok.
Write it down!
Why are you staring at me?
You seem a little agitated,
Mr. van Leuwen.
More. I need more.
Sure, Mr. Notary.
Have as much as you want.
It'll do you good.
More.
I've given them up.
I'm sorry.
-"J'adoube."
-What?
Just a stray seagull.
We're getting close to the coast.
America.
It needs our help.
Can't you hear it screaming?
It's screaming.
It needs our help!
We'll take care of it.
I promise.
You can carry on playing,
don't worry.
We'll take care of it.
Mr. van Leuwen!
Mr. van Leuwen...
Your move, Mr. Notary.
Check.
King in check.
Hold on, I don't see any check.
Does anyone here see a check?
Mr. van Leuwen, I'm not quite sure
what you're trying to do.
I need more water.
More water.
Why so clumsy, solicitor?
How did he get here?
You have to arrest him.
Arrest him without fail.
Shouldn't you better stop, Mr. Notary?
Just stop?
This match isn't doing you any good.
I should stop?
You want me to stop?
You want me to lose.
It seems you've got more to lose
than this match.
Why don't you just start over?
Quiet, please. Quiet!
How is the world champion
meant to concentrate?
You can do it.
Say it.
"I'm the Chinese Emperor."
You still think
this is some kind of joke, don't you?
We don't get
such pompous talk, Mr. Notary.
Must be all the books.
Erich?
Oskar Maria Graf, Joseph Roth,
a book on chess.
We can burn those, can't we?
Goodbye, Josef.
Goodbye.
Oh, Josef...
My dear.
Anna...
Where is this ship headed?
I think you know it.
Come, let's dance.
-You know what I think?
-No.
As long as Vienna keeps dancing,
the world won't end.
Come on, make your move already.
What would be the point?
You already know
what my next move is going to be.
Am I wrong?
We played this match a thousand times.
Again, and again, and again, you won,
Dr. Bartok.
Who are all these people?
Don't be afraid.
We do what you want us to.
Keep on playing.
Keep on.
Good morning.
Were you successful?
He escaped.
He's gone.
Far, far away.
Chess.
No codes, no cryptic messages.
No numbered accounts.
Just a game of chess.
Get the guards.
Yessir.
An entire year.
An entire year, and you get away
without ever leaving your hotel room.
You won the match.

Thank you.
You can go now.
Thank you, Erich.
What kind of book is this?
It's about a man wanting
to return home after a long war.
Cursed, he's forced
to roam the seas on his boat.
-Odysseus.
-Odysseus?
Yes.
And?
Does he find his way home?
Yes.
Are you the new nurse?
No, I'm a visitor from America.
From America.
You can travel again.
The war's over.
-I was there once.
-Really?
For a tournament.
When was that?
You have a lovely voice.
I feel as if...
as if I've heard it before.
May I read to you?
I'd like that.
"Tell me, o Muse...
"of that sagacious man
"who, having overthrown
"the sacred town of Ilium,
wandered far,
"and visited many nations,
learned the customs of their dwellers
"and endured great suffering
on the deep sea.
"Anxious to save himself
and to conduct his followers home.
But to no avail,
as much as he tried..."
IT IS FOR US TODAY
TO MAINTAIN OUR BELIEF
IN AN UNCONQUERABLE SPIRIT.
