Fulfill your wishes
Idols for fame !
Idols for strength
Idols for fertility !
Idols for beauty
It's so obvious that you
don't need an Idol for beauty
The Idol needs you
Thank you
But, for fertility
You want to have a boy,right ?

Get that coin out of your pocket
And give it to the Gods
No sacrifice is  little..
And no wish is big
You can have .....

Gods see it all.....
Stop !
You missesd it!
On purpose
My arrows need important targets
I won't waste them on a chicken,
but on a Deer
And where we going to find a deer ?
what !
Safwan, what are you doing?
Safwan
That's a deer...
...a black deer
Come here, slave !
I said : come..... here !
Stop, slave !
I command you
The deer thinks it's a lion
You better watch it !
You should watch it ! !
I was just joking
Shut up!
Comeon bring her
Stop it
DonÂ¡t move
Please,No
No !
Safwan, It seem like you hit your deer
in Its tail
Never hurt her again !
how dare you command me ?
Give this rat a lesson
Please forgive him master,Safwan
Boys...what are you doing?
Excuse me...
I didn't know you were here sir Safwan
forgive me
Do these two slaves bother you?
I'll beat them if they did
Let's go
Tell your father, I'll deliver his order today
Ghufaira
Did they hurt you ?
I should,ve come to protect you
I'll never let anyone hurt you again
traders
present your offer
so this slave special become yours
Any bidders ?
you were late,sold
Get this miserable from here
best slave in the city
He's smart, knows how to read and write
He knows twenty language
Twenty language
he speaks even with animals
My great sir,Umayya
There is no better servant to
accompany you in your trad takes
That isn't smart as the same
But his strong as a bull
I'll take him
really?
What I mean is... such a good choice
A little expensive but, I know
Gods is generous with you
My dear Umayya
Okba,
one day I'll dip your tongue deep in dirt
Send him to my mansion
Thank you , than you , thank you
thank you...
Oh! ,how great you are Umayya
how generous.. wonderful
Sir
I brought the Idols that you order
Do I take them to your mansion
or to your store in the market ?
what do you think ?
To the store you idiot
And If you late again....
..I won't pay you
I deeply apologize to you
It will never happen again
I was late because I ... had to help your son
Safwan
what about Safwan ?
There was a slave.. assaulting him
which slave ?
They called him bilal
He put your son to the ground
but I reach quickly
And saved him from his hands
Enogh !
Take the Idols to my store immediately
or forget about the deal
As you command.. sure
immediately
Bilal
Pick it up?
I told you to pick it up
whose this apple for ?
Answer me !
It's yours master, it's yours
And what is the difference
between you and this apple ?
No difference,master
Never forget that
Take him to the backyard
And whip him
Move !
Whatever you do
A master give birth to a master
And a slave give birth to a slave
Father, I wish you teach him
a lesson never to forget
How could you let a slave hit you ?
Bilal is lying, father
this slave is lying
He never hit....
You embarrassed me in front of the people
Don't cry !
Stop crying !
listen
He's not crying
and neither should you
It doesn't matter what happened
Don't allow a slave to make fool
of me in front of people again
Stubborn boy !
Mom, tell me...what was my father like?
Your father was a great man
what would you like to be when you're older ?
farmer?
or may be a trader that
makes a lot of money
I want to become a great warrior!
And that's what you'll become
a great warrior
with a beautiful voice
And I want to ride a big horse
And I'll fight the enemies
and protect you and Ghufaira
That's such a noble thing from you Bilal
But..remember
Sword and horse
Do not  make you a great man
really ?
yes
To be a great man
Is to live without chains
chains..?
No, No, No the one you can't see
The one exist here
Inside me ?
To be a warrior
doesn't make you a great man
If you chain yourself with anger and revenge
believing in myths and fear are chains
and there is other chains
To be a great man
You have to free yourself from it all
And how I do that?
I can't see what's inside me
I can
I see the heart of heart man, Bilal
you,ll find the way, the inspiration will come
you,ll  see
No chains will ever stop you
No chains....
You were wrong,mother
I'm a slave
And I'll still be chained forever
Why did they whip you?
You didn't do anything !
That doesn't matter
Master Umayya, do whatever he wants with us
Bilal
Look what I found
I know you didn't mean to lose it !
You still can offer it as a sacrifice
I heard the Priest says
"Graces come from small gifts"
I don't need it
I will not wish for anything again
I am a Slave !
And no God in the market can change that
Alright......I'll keep it
and won't spend it
It is yours
I'll keep it with me
till you ask me for it
Very funny !
No...No!
 It amaze me every time
You fly over that horse back
I never get bored
It's only the third time
This day !
But for me
I Never miss
You just love to brag, Saad
Also you have money
and time to train
You need more than
money to be skillful
A great deal of Determination
Right !
And your determination....fruit hunting ?!
I have to get back
believe me
We don't want to make
master Umayya angry
Tell me , Bilal
Why don't you ride
the horse and leave ?
Cross the hills and proceed
to whatever they lead you
To find my mansion for example ?
If it happens and I found it
Most likely, I'll serve in it
Good by, " Apple hunter "
 For your service
Good by, my friend
Please, give me some money ?
I want some food, or money
Please !?
- Please, give me money ?
- Get out of my way
Please, I have no food ?
Get out of my way, kid
We shouldn't do that
But I feel hungry.
Here..
Take this
You are too kind
 You prefer to lose what you have
than to cause loss for the Gods ?
I wanted the boy to
avoid getting beaten
So you care for a homeless boy
more than the Idols ?
Tell me ...don't you
believe in Priests promises
I apologize master
I'm just a slave
I know nothing
You don't know !
Or know too well
You're not a Priest
You are the famous trader
Abu Bakr
That's right
Did you kneel because
you thought I'm a Priest
Or my question is
the reason you got afraid ?
Rise my son don't be afraid
No, sir I'm not afraid
Do you underestimate fear ?
Sir, what do you know about fear ?
I saw it a lot in eyes of human
Enough to understand how
it turns many into slaves
A woman fears to give birth to a girl
so she made a sacrifice and beg to Idols
to have a boy
A rich man fear poverty
So he share a little amount
of his money with Gods
And promise more if they
help him to stay rich
An old man fear death !
So he pays the Priest to save him
This fear forces them to seek
sanctuary among these Gods
Gods of greed and injustice
Hoping that all their problems will go away
This holy place wasn't built
to contain all this corruption
It was built
So that all human can live together
As equals
and to follow the one creator
Except for slaves
Son..
No One was born a slave
You were free in the past,
Isn't it right?
I was free
long time ago
The demons raided my village
Destroyed my house
Took me, and took Ghufaira
My sister
What about your...
She still speaks to me
Sir..
All this talk about equality
Is just wishes
And It doesn't mean anything to me
Sir, save your speech for
some who can buy
the thing that you are selling
Young man
Life is more generous than you think
I'm not here to sell you anything
maybe sir...
But not for slaves
My master is waiting for this
I have to get back
who is your master ?
Master Umayya
The greatest man in Mecca
And what's your name ,son ?
Bilal
Bilal !
I saw greatness in the hand
that saved the boy today
And remember ...
The great ones are the ones who
have the will to choose their destiny
 Comeon move 
 Move , Faster 
 Move , Faster 
   Faster 
 Comeon move 
Well done,sir
Sir?!
Master, Safwan ...
Master, Safwan
Your father needs you
How many time do I have to remind you ?
kneel when you'er in front of me, slave
kneel  !
A few were born to lead
And others to serve
This position doesn't suit you, brother
Get up my friend
I'll show you what I made
for the celebrate tonight
You will like it
Where is he ?
You are late !
Remember my sister ?
Ghufaira
My lady
I'm Soheib
A first class Slave
And skillful blacksmith,no bragging
yes, funny man
where were you ?
Time for the celebration is near
They'll whip you if you were late
I am not late
Master asked me to get ,Safwan
Did they hurt you ?
I would've turned Safwan to a Potato bag
If I got there early
That spoiled
Him and the idiot that hung around with
You have to stay strong, Bilal
They draw their strength from
the fear they put in us
We should never submission
Alright, to work
Look !
Special order
To your master from mine
It is so shiny!
Perfect work , Soheib
Yes, It is the best thing I've made
That's right It's Mohammad
it's unbelievable
He goes around talking
contrary to our Gods
Every day!
Every day!
And I don't know the number of his followers
Your playing is so clear
You depend a lot on luck
Luck love brave ones
Maybe !
But will you take risk in real life ?
You ask like you doesn't know me !
I ask
Because I see imminent danger
Don't be obsessed with nonsense
This nonsense can strike you
where you are now, Umayya
Let us make them an example
And remind them what happens to
those who dare to oppose us
We have A trade to protect
Abu Al-Hakam as usual...
you ruined my evening with your concerns
Bilal !
Come sing for us !
To Soothe the mood
Yes, I heard my slaves many times
praising his voice
let us listen
#  Distant shadow #
# Mountains and trees #
# I stand now #
# With my lonely heart #
# Prestigious shadow #
# Mysteries and secrets #
# Sky cry us #
# With tears like rains #
# And shadow comes #
# Overwhelm me #
# How to survive ? #
# Mom where are you? #
# Suspicious destiny #
# Like Darkness of the night #
# And submerged light #
# dream with trace for..... #
#  my salvation #
 Comeon, Umayya make him sing again 
Slave !
disbelief !
  this is disbelief ! 
Arrogant
Disbelievers !
what are you looking at ?
Don't stare , slave
Every day you saturate your thirst
with water our Gods provide
But what you give in return ?
Nothing !
Today you will repent your
mistakes to me, traitors
No! Soheib
let him go !
Cowards !
No!
Get this one
Whip him
Please... stop!
No!
Please...
  Look It is him!
he's the great warrior
 It is  Hamza 
Abu Al-Hakam.. The Lion
Hamza,  you got here on time
Look at these Dogs
Disbelievers !
They must be disciplined....
Discipline of who..?, coward
You call yourselves Men ?
you are disgrace on Mecca and your ancestors
Since when this water isn't for everyone ?
And know this ...
I only see God through the work of human
Your brutality today revealed
to me the truth of your belief
So Fight me ...
Or get out of my sight
Hamza
You got here on time , my friend
Abu Bakr
I haven't seen for a while
Come, we have a lot to discuss
Comeon, Bilal help me setting him up
Do you believe that change will happens?
Even with us ?
Maybe !
Mom had hope in that
why you are asking ?
Bilal ?!
This morning ......
I went to see him again
You again ?
There is no little thieves to be save here
Sir...
What did you mean when you said
We choose ?!
Do you offer to buy me ?
Do you want me to ?
well, you seem better master
than the one I'm serving now
Believe it or not , Bilal
Your master is a Slave too
Really ?
And who would be His master ?
Greed
It's the Worst all the time
Does this mean that no one is ever free ?
I didn't mean that
So how can I be free?
Only you enslave yourself , bilal
I apologize to you
but...
No one ever treated me with kindness
And I still can't understand Why?
Why someone with your place would want
to help a slave like me ?
Do you expect me to do something in return ?
Listen, Bilal
The Messenger of Allah
guided me when I was lost
Because  he's a great and noble man
spreading Islam and the message of equality
I chose to do the same he did,
and follow his path
And who knows, Bilal
Maybe someday , you'll inspire
the hearts of many too
Me !?
How would I do that ?
Come, sit
You  looked for me to talk , right?
let's talk
It seem our mother was right
Yes
She was..
And that what I expected
She was always very wise...
let's drink the toast of my son ,Safwan
He made a lot of money from this little idols
And he can now offord
to host his first feast
 To Safwan 
 To Safwan 
Are still sad for wasting a good deal ?
I told you that Idols will sold Quickly
It might be the last profit any of us make
what are you taking about ?
These little Idols are fortune
I wished you could hear the Priest calls
for them to be sold today
You weren't there
There has been a disagreement
People gathered...
Disagreement..?
Who started this disagreement ?
Deceitful Muslims
Their ideas spread like wildfire across the city
Oh, please.. If you had said
that there was an army coming
I'd be worried
And their speech about freedom
Isn't worrying?
what are you talking about ?
They say that we take
advantage of people misery
They say that the True God
will never ask for fortune
What would happen to our interests
If  the message is firmly established
And for how long Traders
with tolerate this Massage ?
They'll throw them out of Mecca
Or someone will make a deal with them
You'll see
Look around you !
There is just one Master
And it is Money !
This is the true faith in our city
But these days not all
our traders worship Idols
Where is that lazy one
who sold idols in a bags ?
He joined Muslims !
And What about Abu Bakr..
where is he ?
He became a muslim too,
long time ago !!!
Abu Al-Hakam is right
People buy Idols made from Dates
But I think they're eating it as sweets
Is there any other traitors in my house ?
Raise !
And reveal yourselves
Maybe you should ask your slave ?
What..?
what are you talking about ?
Slave ?
why don't you tell my
father about your new friend ?
impossible !
You must be wrong
there's no traitors in my house
Isn't that right, bilal
Speak !
Safwan accused you with treason
comeon defend yourself!
I said speak , slave
I give my permission to speak
We were... all born... Equal
We breathe the same air
We bleed the same blood
And we'll die ... and be buried
under the same ground
I believe..... That I'm a Free man
as the same as you
Equals.. Free
I hate both words
Umayya, It seem that this
slave did sleep well yesterday
Equals.. Free.. huh?
Hey, People.. all of you
Look ..
we are equals
You slapped me once because this slave
made fool of you in front of the people
What would you do with him now, ....father ?
Guards !
To be a great man First you a have to
Break free from your chains
Take this slave
Comeon , move !
Chain him !
Apostate !
Chain him well
Let him rot inside the cage
No water...
No food
He'll come back to his senses
Hang on ,Bilal 
Help will come 
* I see the heart of Great man, Bilal *
Deny your call 
 Nobody touch this slave.. Umayya's orders 
Deny your call, Slave ! 
I won't...
No!!
Bilal, are you alright ?
You have to be strong ,Bilal
A master give birth to a master
And a slave give birth to a slave 
* Humanity is one nations *
Bilal, are you alright ?
* Who look at it from the outside... *
*  Sees it as a dream ...*
* Inspire will come to you , You'll see *
And what's the difference
between and other people ?
Deny your call 
kneel when you'er in front of me, slave 
* And those who look inside *
* themselves Will be guided*
* And with guidance *
* Your story will start from this desert *
* To spread across the world *
*  Here.. where the Great men are tested *
* Be well prepared, Bilal  *
* To be a great man *
* Is to live without chains *
Bilal, are you awake ?
Good
Much braver than I thought
I take the credit
You learned it from watching
me all these years
Save yourself the suffering
what you revealed takes lots of daring
But unfortunately , you still think like a slave
I'll tell you a secret that will make
you come back to your senses
I never believe in these Gods
No, No , No I'm not an idiot
In fact we are both slaves ,Bilal
The difference between us
That I worship what is stronger than me
But you ...
You worship what is going to destroy you
A free man knows how to take chances
for example he may offer to spy
on the enemies of his master
He may realize the benefit of it
Do you understand what I'm saying , Bilal ?
Let him drink
Do you want me to take the chains off?
What do you think , Bilal?
I'm already ...
freed from My chains
that's strange !
Because I see them
Or your invisible God make things invisible !?
I'm talking about chains that...
Are inside me
Don't talk mysteries
Don't you see the quandary you're in ?
I could kill you right now
I don't care what would you do with me
And there's nothing you can offer me
I am.. free indeed
And what about your sister ?
Is she free too ?
So,tell me...will you think of my offer or not ?
You wanted a horse?
I'll give you two
And I'll provide you and your sister with a house
 Accept his offer!
 Bring him!
Get him out
Free him 
Thats why you're a slave and I'm a master
because you don't seize opportunity
when it comes to you
What a disappointment !
So , kill me
I won't try to kill you
But nevertheless, you might die
Your time has come
No, Bilal!
Tell me, slave, to whom you pray
Is him stronger than me ?
Is he stronger than our Gods ?
Because of their  power
And my power
I can give the order to kill you
Stop ! 
Or to release you
Stop him! 
That is ..
my god
Do you want him to come save you ?
Accept
And I'll ask him to forgive
your transgressions
I offered a fair price for him
Too fair
So what is the reason to bring him here?
 Release him 
I warn you..
If one drop of his blood is dropped
The deal is off
We'll see
This Slave is accused of outrageous crimes
He stood in the face of his master
And for all that
We are going to punish him
No!
 It is going to kill him 
No!
No!
Please master,Safwan
 He will die! 
Do you feel this ?
Slave !
Give up , Bilal
This will all end
Ask us for forgiveness
And accept us as lasting master of you
And accept  these
as your true Gods
How many Gods is there?
You know how to count ?
Slave !
The One True God
The One True God
What did you do ?
you are arrogant
I .. am
Free man
No! No! , Bilal
Please! Stop
He will die!
I'll double the offer !!
I see that you lost your skills in trading
He is yours
Left the rock of him
Bilal ?
I was determined to pay
everything I have for him
For a slave ..?
No !
But for a brother
Don't tell me the islam religion
makes slaves and  masters to be  brothers
Yes , brothers
Easy, easy
Bilal?
His sister !
I will pay the same price for her ?
You are asking the wrong person
I presented him as gift for Safwan
I won't sell her...
Even for all your trade
Take her !
No!
what are you doing ?
Get away from her !
No!
Three Month later...
I'll be always grateful to you
for saving my life
The one Who gave life to one person
Will be As he gave life to all people
What is it feels like walking Mecca,s Streets
Free and liberal
Just grateful to be walking
Where is, Soheib ?
With Hamza
And Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq
They're waiting for us at the gate
Your disobedience to Umayya
spread throughout Mecca
He and his slave will come for you
Bilal
We have to leave
Where would we go ?
To a great City ...
That will warmly welcome us
Astonishing, isn't it?
Man made sword for hunting
And Providing food for his family
These days
Humans use it
To kill  each other
It lost its value and purpose
The true ones
Can you teach how to fight ?
Why?
Do you think if you knew how to fight
The outcome would be in your favor
Or you could have whatever
you wish for with sword?
Remember..
I can teach you how to use it
But you will decide
When and where?
Violence never solve arguments
Don't let anyone  get you into a fight
That you can avoid it
when will we get started ?
as soon as you put the
sword back in its place
And take that branch
Saad
Well
let's start the fight
What you do got rookie ?
After you "Apple hunter "?
 Bilal, turn!  
  Duck!
  Defence move !
As we trained !
You are not that fast , Bilal !
 Try avoiding this !
Ghufaira
I defeated you again
Come, get up
Let's fight when you calm down,Bilal
Never attack when your at rage
We will free her,Bilal
Don't lose hope
A strong man can control his anger
And the one who forgives
when can get revenge
will witness glory
I promise you
I'll do my best
Promise me to train this
True power is in the mind not in weapon
And thats is Hamza's secret
One day, Bilal
You'll discover your own secret
# Oh The full moon rose over us #
# From the valley of farewell #
# And we owe it to show gratefulness #
# Where the call is to Allah #
Finally
Comeon !
# Oh who were raised among us#
Welcome you all
# coming with a word to be obeyed #
# The city was honored by your present#
# welcome best caller to God's way #
# welcome best caller to God's way #
Welcome to Yathrib
It's,Bilal
Here He is
He came
Come with us
Wait, where we are going?
Bilal !
where you taking me?
Mother !
Watch how I will build a house
Look how we will build a mosque
brings us all together
To spread hope
A hope
That will inspire the hearts of people
The Messenger of Allah asks you
to call upon them for prayer
Mr, Bilal
From here ...
Call upon them for prayer
Show me ...
Show me how your voice will be
An inspiration
How will you raise it to
call for justice...and equality
((Allah Is Great, Allha Is Great))
What I feared is happening, Umayya
They are getting more in
number and in strength
Are we supposed to stay still?
He is right , Father
When the slave defiance his master
World turns upside down
  Kill them all !
  All of them !
We will Start from here
Tonight !
Raise a massive army
To crush every place that houses them
let's purify Mecca from them
Extirpate them all  !!
And kill them
  Kill them all !
More people are arriving!
Great horse
He followed us when we were getting back
Do you know him ?
know him ?
Too well
He Once  was Umayya's
It seems he escape his wrath too
Take well care of him
This old man brought news from Mecca
Persecution !
Getting worse every day
We lost a lot
but we are lucky
Because we escaped !
I am afraid that the rest
Will lose their lives soon
A Message for you from Umayya's son
Ghufaira

After one year ...
I expected to find you here
Nothing I say will
makes you feel better
I only ask you to
keep your mind clear
And your heart faithful
You have to be sure
That Allah will always
be at your side
I have made this for you
When you decide to use it
Remember ..
Don't allow it to control your decision
*My God ...*
*The Mighty, The Strong*
*The Eternal Owner of Sovereignty*
*In you we trust for Better or worse*
Those fools had gathered
to take us down
I will lead the army
You have to protect Mecca
They threaten our authority..
Our power
Don't you dare disappoint me
* Protect us from all evil*
*Because there is no power nor *
*strength but from you Allah the Mighty*
Amen
This must be a joke !
It is very unfortunate !
 They are many!
Hold your ground men
Steady!
Send the best three
First we crush their spirits
