So? What’s going on?
As if, what have I
been to up to day?
Yes.
It’s been a- I did an episode
of 'Critical'.
You know, the
television 'Critical'.
I don’t know ‘Critical' now.
Earlier this year.
It’s um... It’s good, it was good.
I’ll get you a copy on DVD.
And it’s a… one of this medical series,
drama, hospital things.
Concerned neighbour.
That’s the part here.
Yeah.
It ain’t really matter what it looks like, does it?
I’m just gonna say that
I really like the script.
It’s good script.
Okay, thank you, thank you.
- Great, thanks Martin.
Mark.
Thank you.
Fuck this flat!
Pierce!
- Can’t! Late!
Never mind... Never mind ‘can’t, late’? Wait!
You owe me rent money.
I will have it.
You little shit.
Walk the dog, will you?
‘How was the audition' maybe?
My name is Pierce.
I’m an writer, structure actor and a waiter.
Right?
And uh-
and I have in the past um-, I’m
Sure some of you have,
Been drinking… drinking…, certainly drinking,
There’s a lot of no getting away.
And thought, this is too much,
This is too… too many drinks,
at the same… in the same time frame.
And I... alcohol is being part
of that and certainly in the pub,
and I have thought on occasion,
this is the kind of things an alcoholic does.
So I sat there and the
man stared at me.
Yeah, well I don’t know
why you’re still doing
bit part auditions
for crap films.
I’m writing an epic.
- Minus?
Bloke, down on his luck.
- Yeah.
No hope.
- Yeah.
No prospects. Totally desperate.
- That’s me?
I said yes.
Commits a crime.
- Okay. What crime?
I don’t know yet, Mark!
Jesus you’re like a fucking...
I have to let that stuff
float around in me head for a while.
Pint?
- No, no, I can’t go for a pint.
Okay, sorry.
- You know that.
You’re supposed to help me.
- Sorry.
I’ll go for one.
You there David?
- I’ll do the dog.
Now, now, who’s had a lovely one?
Who’s had a lovely one? Come on. That’s it, come on.
Get in there. Come on, come on.
Shitty flat.
Fuck.
Morning.
Hiya. What time is it?
Did you sleep okay?
Um- Not really, no.
Is he awake?
- No.
Listen Mark, will you please
talk to Jack today?
I did try, and I
will again, yeah.
Ok. Just do, okay? Because the kitchen light
Is gone again.
Okay, I have the list.
Draughty kitchen window,
the plates couple of things,
The sitting room window pulley’s thing.
The Chandelier.
- The Chandelier.
The broken flat in general.
I’m not messing them, Mark.
- I know, okay.
The kitchen lights as well.
Okay.
See you later.
Um- No kiss?
- I have to go to work.
To-Do-List:
- FIX LIVING-ROOM WINDOW
- REPLACE BATHROOM DOOR HANDLE
- KITCHEN TAP LEAKS
Oh Jesus.
Excuse me, Sir! Excuse me, Sir!
This is a misunderstanding.
I have...
I... Stop!
Okay, listen up.
He commits a crime.
- Who does?
Our man.
Down in his luck.
Commits a crime that goes wrong.
- Okay.
What crime?
He decides, this is the thing,
he decides to kidnap someone.
Who is he gonna?
- The bollocks face.
His landlord?
- Um- Yeah.
Because if you think about it.
The property of someone like this
is worth millions.
Okay.
- So our story,
our man decides...
- That’s me.
Yeah. You decide to kidnap the landlord,
And it all goes wrong.
Like people die.
You know. So it’s like 'Fargo'
with a little bit of ‘Dog Day Afternoon'.
I’ll bash that out.
- And he plays the clarinet.
The lead me,
he plays clarinet.
Why?
-Because I play clarinet.
They’ll cast someone else.
- Yeah, you can swim too.
Do you want to be a swimmer?
Hey.
Loads of actors can swim.
Stuck!
I don’t know, there’s something
not right about the clarinet.
Why not? It’s hip.
Think Blockbuster.
- The saxophone now.
I thought
my flat was fucked.
Listen, I’m more concerned with the story
not which
wind instrument the man plays.
It’s a… It’s a… Gene Hackman in
‘The Conversation'. He’s an outsider.
Perfect.
- It’s wack.
A clarinet movie.
Let’s sort it out.
All that.
Hello?
- Jack, hi. Mark downstairs.
Listen, you probably know,
that we’re a bit
behind in our rent.
A bit? A bit behind?
Three fucking months behind.
Is it that much
- September, October...
I should have it at this week probably,
definitely at the end of the week.
I will have it.
- Yeah, you will have.
Or you’re out?
- Okay, thanks. Thanks, Jack.
Oh, incidentally.
Sally was wondering if you could fix
a couple of bits down here?
Yeah, when I see my fucking money
in my account
and when I feel like it.
- Of course. Hello?
Wanker.
Hello?
She gave you the rent.
- Yes.
To give it to bollocks face.
- Yes.
And you didn’t.
But I didn’t steal it
Pierce, I used it.
I paid our telephone bill
I got a full tank of petrol for the car.
Which has been confiscated.
- Which has been confiscated.
I bought us food,
I paid off most of the gas bill.
- Here. Get your car back.
No.
- Go on, take that, take it!
It’s bad money,
It’s from the horses. Take it there, now
Thank you.
- You’re grand!
And get something nice for Sally
or take her somewhere nice.
Do something. Act. Lead.
The rent can wait.
That bollocks will get his money from me
when he fixes the flat.
I’ll get you back.
I’ve see a man about a thing.
But you have… you have to do that, Mark, you know?
You have to show her
a bit of Errol Flynn, Tom Selleck, Tarzan.
Or just man, wouldn’t you know?
Fetch!
How are you, Frances?
- How are you, Martin Scorsese?
How is it going?
Which race, Pierce?
No, I mean as… you know, how… how are you
in your… in your life?
And you look well, you know, so
how is… how is… how is it?
I’m grand.
You placing a bet?
Hi.
I have, uh- booked us a night
in a fancy hotel
for tomorrow. Four stars.
And, I’ve got you these.
Are we on the same planet?
Done. It’s paid for.
Where did you get the money?
Wait.
Don’t tell me.
Pierce gave it to you.
Not necessarily.
This is mental, Mark. This is mental
- You just hear me out, okay.
Meself and Pierce are working a way…
- Fuck Pierce, Christ. Fuck it!
Would you…, would you just
answer me one question?
Or just…, just go with this.
What is Pierce?
What?
- What is he?
Because he’s… he’s not a writer
and he is definitely not a waiter.
So what is he exactly?
I’ll tell… tell you what he is.
Pierce is a waste of a man. He is a waste of a man.
Jesus, do you not see
anything, Mark?
Well, we have a film.
- Wow!
Which we’ve been working on.
- Where’s the money for the film?
What you mean where’s the money?
Money, money. Real world, money!
Jesus.
You think I like
making cheese sandwiches
for fucking wankers?
I do it because
they pay me, Mark.
You can… have a look at that  if you like.
It’s got a pool.
How lovely.
Why don’y you bring Pierce, and I’ll
stay here and mind your brother for you?
I wonder Sally never wants to
go anywhere with you,
All you do is sit there and mope them.
That’s falling apart, Pierce.
I think it’s over.
Oh grand, nobody died.
Thanks.
You know your problem?
Here we go. Yeah?
You’re very… nice.
And for a woman
after a while very nice
is gonna equal very dull.
Women like tricky.
You know? A mission,
they wanna change their man.
There’s a big, flat screen telly
in the bathroom.
David, iI’ll just put this on you
because it’s freezing outside.
Coming.
Hiya!
Come on in.
We’re just right to go for a walk.
Hi.
So, you need a few bits done?
- Yeah. There’s about fifty things that need to be done.
The shutters in the kitchen,
can’t open them,
And the light keeps going off as well,
which doesn’t have hurries.
The window in there is driving me crazy
and also the chandeliers...
Yeah, listen, is there any chance
of my money?
- Huh. -Your rent.
This month’s, last month’s.
I know we gave you your rent.
Mark gave it to you.
No.
No he didn’t.
Um… Houston, we have a problem.
Listen, you wanna come upstairs,
there’s little books?
Movies,
going to restaurants,
holidays,
a home.
Just things that people have,
you know, just... normal things.
A baby.
We can.
- No.
Mark, it’s gone
- No.
It... It’s gone.
I love you, Sally.
Mark, I’m moving out tomorrow.
My dad’s gonna come right down...
- Ah, Sally...
Stop.
Okay.
Please don’t leave me.
Hello, Pierce, schmuck!
Did you get my letter?
Look, you’re supposed to send
this shit to me. Ok?
It’s the law.
So, wen I appeal
whatever the fuck you’re on about,
which I will…
- Ah. Really?
I never had you down
as a lawyer, Pierce.
A complete and utter
waste of space,
a boozer,
somebody who like the horses,
but never had ye down
as a lawyer, son.
You- you fucking register
this legal envelope,
otherwise it’s Nick’s Felicitat, okay?.
And- and you fucking
send it to me. Here, here,
put that towards it,
And leave me alone.
I’ll see you in court,
you lanky streaker...
Morning madam.
Reno.
Morning, Jersey.
You’re the only one,
she loves now.
What? Nope. I’ve been let go.
Oh, my God!
Come on, Liam, refreshment time.
Fuck sick.
Bye bye beautiful doggy.
(A big Catholic wedding in front of a whole village in Oxford) I’m dead.
I am so dead.
David?
This is Pierce secretary, he’s out now,
but he will call you back,
If he has any credit left.
Hello! Rang the bell!
I don’t need an invitation.
It’s my fucking house.
Look down in here?
- There’s been an accident.
An accident? But you wouldn’t do it
fucking deliberately, would you?
I tell you what, son,
that does not want to be broken.
Handmade.
And this, this is a partition wall.
One, two, three
expanding bolts.
And that’s gonna cost you.
Painters and decorators in,
that’s gonna cost you.
My time, you’re paying for that.
It’s coming out of your deposit.
I mean look at it, son, what are you a fucking student?
Right.
I start in the kitchen.
And only because your missus
asked me to.
Your ex, this is.
Fucking actors!
Jack?
Pierce?
Company Comportal
Telecommunication. - Yes?
My name is Louise and, Mark,
you’ve been chosen to receive…
Louise...
- ...a very, very special...
At least 200 or 400 of free
local and national mobile to mobile or… - Louise...
I will call you
I’m in the middle of something.
Thanks. Bye.
Jack?
The chandelier...
Yeah?
Hello Mark, it’s me.
- Yeah.
Yeah, listen,
I think I have this thing.
Okay, forget the 'Fargo',
all that kidnap bollocks, right.
That’s not gonna work.
Here it is.
Our saxophone-guy, right? Down on his luck,
decides to kill his mother.
He just kills his mother, yeah, mother.
And the thing of it is, right,
his mother’s in a wheelchair.
And… Wheelchair, yeah.
And don’t, you know, don’t hate me for that,
or get annoyed, right? I know it’s a bit
close to home,
but listen, Mark,
cripply actors,
they win Oscars,
full stop.
Could you come here?
Are you okay?
I need you.
Well, like now?
- Please.
What, now now?
Yeah.
Yeah, okay,
all right, I’m on my way.
Pierce. I think,
I might be going funny
What are you doing?
I’m having a peculiar...
I’m gonna give you a scenario, say, for a film,
and you’ve to tell me,
what you think of it.
Uh- There’s three people in the house,
and there’s an accident
and somebody ends up dead.
- Yeah.
Then immediately
there’s another accident
Hang on, how did the first gay die?
- It doesn’t matter.
Um- two, two of them,
two have now died, they’re dead.
And your man killed them?
No, no, no, no,
Nobody killed anybody.
What’s it? His wife,
and they’re not getting on
and bang!
And our guy witnesses that.
I said it was an accident.
- You can’t do that.
That’s bollocks.
That’s farce.
Nobody does that anymore.
Yeah.
Like you know, 1920’s or something, you know.
That’s black-and-white, speed it up.
Chasing cats up ladders.
Nobody wants that anymore, man.
Okay. Okay.
Don’t get sensitive,
nobody does that anymore.
It’s completely… That’s old style.
It doesn’t work.
And I’ll do the plot.
I presume you had another rap.
You should be with someone who’s just more
kind of mousy, you know, mousy and dull
and doesn’t wanna do stuff
and go places, and…
Mark.
Mark, David is dead.
Mark, Mark, we have to do something.
I know you are in shock,
but we have to call an ambulance and the police
and all of those things that we have to…
What the fuck is that?
Jack.
- Yeah, I know.
Why has he got a thing in his neck?
Why is he bleeding?
I don’t know, Pierce.
He’s dead.
You din’t do… you din’t… you… you din’t do…
you didn’t do that...
You din’t… you have nothing to… you…
he died because you... did the murder?
No, Pierce, I didn’t do anything.
No, no.
That’s I’m- just I have to…
I know that.
But look at the fucking…
he’s fucking dead, Mark.
I tried to tell you,
outside.
Oh, and I’m sorry
I didn’t understand, Mark.
Sorry I didn’t quite get that.
Fucking hell!
What’s…
Mark, what the fuck is…, what’s that?
Mark, what’s that?
Yeah, that’s Jersey.
He died too.
This is fucked.
Yeah.You okay?
Yeah.
But we need to ruse, seriously we need to, you know
Just get- get composed, just to be…
Okay.
Because… Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Okay, what’re you gonna say?
How you’re gonna hand it…?
I’m gonna say
there’s been a terrible accident.
Two terrible accidents.
- Okay. Wait, can’t, wait, wait, wait.
Um- Well, I’m a cop now, so you’re talking
to me now and what are you saying?
The dog was asleep and...
- Mark, fuck the dog, fuck the dog, okay?
Don’t talk to me about the dog, okay?
Take me to the main.
The chandelier thing
came down on my brother.
Say it was loose,
You have to say it was loose.
It was a loose chandelier, the loose chandelier fell down.
- Okay, okay,
Um- and um- my brother um-. David,
was positioned under it…
No, he was not positioned, he was not positioned.
He was seating.
He happened to be
seating under it,
the loose chandelier,
which fell on him.
…To be seating under it.
Then, um- bollocks face walked in…
Don’t call him that,
obviously.
My landlord walks in...
- Your landlord,
who you fucking hate
and you owe a lot of money to.
What? Why are you doing it?
I haven’t killed anybody.
I’m just a cop.
Okay, I- I don’t know these things.
I want… answers.
Uh, hello.
Not many people die
by chandelier, Mark, you know.
Or fall off a wonky table
and get
a screwdriver in their neck.
in the same half hour.
- Four minutes.
Yeah, right, exactly..
That’s why you have to be totally… totally clear.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, no, no, Mark!
Tell me you told her something
tell me you phoned her?
Gotta deal with it loud.
Come with me, will you?
Mark! I’m not cleaning
this mess up, Mark.
I’m moving out of this flat...
I’m out of here.
I can’t do this.
I can’t.
- Just go, go.
He changed the locks.
Yeah.
Look, uh- I would never,
ever, ever,
run out on you, okay?
So I was gonna come back anyway, you know?
You know that.
I just had to… I had to… get my head together
and so trying to get that, my head together.
It’s very difficult with this.
I’m going to help you.
You know I will.
I just wanted to just…
Okay?
- Yeah.
Mark, Mark, when I went upstairs,
there were two people
who were not alive in four flat, weren’t there?.
Yeah.
How many are there now?
What is that?
Me clarinet stand.
Must go, Mark!
Get out of my way!
Mark, what is this?
Mark!
Mark, everybody’s dead, you know?
I mean...
Am I next, is that it?
What are you gonna do?
A bash in the eye?
Or the fucking clarinet up the hole?
You know, can I go anywhere?
I’m scared frankly.
Are you blaming me?
You were here.
Don’t implicate me.
- Well, don’t implicate me?
My brother is dead,
my girlfriend has just died,
I need a minute.
You don’t have a minute.
I don’t have a minute.
Mark! Grieving
is a luxury right now.
Mark, open the door.
Look, you have to start thinking about this, okay?.
I see it,
we’ve got over two options.
Just get the police.
- That is not one of them.
The first one involves beards and Morocco.
And the other one is that,
we try and figure out how 
to explain this to anybody else,
who is not as totally fantastic
and ludicrous.
And look, there’s three dead people,
right? Two men and a woman.
There’s no other dead?
Mark, is there any other dead people?
No. Good!
And then:
so David was under the chandelier.
And then he died,
it fell, and
Sally came in
and she tripped,
on the dog,
or stilettos or…
No. Draft two:
you and Jack, hated each other and…
I am now getting the police.
- Nope.
You don’t do anything
till we get our story straight, okay?
Get your hands off me!
Listen to me, this is not just about you anymore.
We have to connect
Sally and Jack.
Otherwise people look at us and th- they don’t believe.
David was under the chandelier,
And then it fell and he died.
And then Jacks comes in,
with the toolbox,
and you challenged him.
Oh, I murdered him.
- No, you manslaughter.
Oh, fuck about it.
- And then, Sally comes in,
and she sees Jack,
and she throws herself
on the clarinet stand.
Why?
Because… Because they’re shagging,
because they are man-womaning.
They’re? What?
Okay, I’ve got it, got it.
Okay.
Inbox...
Uh- “Need bed tonight, question mark”
Yeah- “Can’t wait."
That’s today.
“You’re a very naughty lady."
“You’re a bad, bad boy.”
“Can we do that thing again?"
What thing?
What fucking thing?
- I don’t know.
I think it’s probably this thing’
Mark, that’s um...
I wouldn’t worry about it.
That kind of thing can’t carry on, you know that.
That wou- That’s not love.
You know about that?
- No, no
Well you know, look, Sally was a great person, you know.
Kind and lovingly.
Everybody has a dark side, so
you just have to
put that behind you really
because we have things to do, you know?
We have problems, she doesn’t any more, so...
let’s just… Can we just carry on, please.
Accident: an unlikely and unforeseen event or happing,
typically resulting in injury.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Mark. Mark. Mark, Mark, Mark!
Mark, read that.
Top left, 'Accident'.
an unlikely and unforeseen event or happing,
typically resulting in injury.
We’re gonna move him.
Pierce?
- Yeah?
Can you fill me in here, please?
He- he has to die in his flat.
That way it’s… it’ll be perfect, totally perfect.
What difference does it make where he dies?
Because it’s an accident.
And accidents are unlikely.
That’s what an accident is, okay?
If two people die
in the same place,
that’s incredibly unlikely, okay?
Wildly unlikely.
Three people, forget about it.
That doesn’t happen
to anyone ever. All right?
That’s taking the piss.
And I will have
some of whatever’s in that bottle,
in a large glass now, that you.
We’re gonna need blankets,
two blankets. No, four blankets.
Pierce, they do very thorough
forensics. - I know that.
That’s why Jack
has to die in his flat
by his own hand, okay?
There’s no other prints
in that screwdriver!
Sally and David died down here,
in totally unrelated and
separate instance, right?.
And that’s the story,
that we are gonna tell,
and we’re gonna do that
because we are going to bleach the fuck
out of everything that suggests otherwise.
Okay?
And I just wanna say now,
before we get into this,
that you are being very critical of pretty much
everything I’m coming up with right now,
and that’s making it a bit hard,
I have to say, just a bit,
and I would really appreciate
any kind of support or, indeed, presence
that you could muster,
so I didn’t feel like
I was trudging in a void
like a fucking ghost alone, okay?
Cheers.
This is mental.
Masking tape, we’re gonna need masking tape.
Uh, and a plunger!
Stop, stop, stop.
There, there. Put it down.
Right, okay.
Get his arms.
Okay, don’t spill any blood.
No, wait, I’ll take his arms.
Don’t spill blood.
And, um- okay, we’re going to need to move that, so…
Um- prints, prints, prints.
Carefully, carefully, carefully!
Don’t spill any blood.
One, two, three and lift!
Go, go, go, go!
This is a lie, Pierce.
Shut up. It’s not.
It’s the new truth, right?
It din’t happen here,
it happen upstairs. Now go.
Watch out for blood.
This is just wrong.
Okay, come on.
Okay, wait, I gotta get his keys.
Wait, wait.
Okay?
- Yeah.
Get the blood, get the blood. We need
all the blood for upstairs.
We’re gonna need more tape.
Hi.
- Is Sally here?
How are you?
Mark!
Eh, little children, playing
that doorbell game.
First they ring, und
then they run away.
It’s so… It drives you mad,
but it’s a bit of fun, I suppose.
We all did it,
I did it, you did it.
Is she here?
- Who?
Sally. I am her father.
No. Sally is not here,
Sally went in the car.
Where is she?
I came to collect her bags.
Yeah. You probably want to speak to Mark.
Could you hang on?
Mark! Mark! Ma...
- I can’t!
Mark also,
he.. They went out in- to the ca- in the car.
Mark is not here either.
I don’t understand.
I made an arrangement.
Yeah.
I’ll take the dog now.
You, no... The car, the dog,
the dog is not here.
They are- went out, all of them, in the car.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I’m a bit fluey actually,
But, you know, you have to carry on.
Have you been drinking?
No. Yea. What’s it… It won’t.
You’ll pass on that to her.
- Oh yeah, I will.
Thanks a million.
- Okay.
Best to Mrs. Finnegan.
I’m gonna go upstairs
and uh- see,
where to put him, okay?
Can you finish getting the blood, please.
Shit, take the key.
Pierce, take the key.
Hi.
Do you live here?
Yeah.
Is your name Mark?
Yeah.
Okay, Mark,
we’ve hd a couple of complaints,
about the noise.
Who told you?
I’m not at liberty to say.
Do you play the saxophone?
Saxophone?
Yeah.
David?
I’ll be there in a second.
Except the- it’s actually a clarinet.
Right.
Between you and me,
I think she’s an old woman,
and she lives by herself.
- Yeah.
Now I’m sorry about this, this is only protocol,
but I’m gonna have to do a decibel check.
Do you mind
if I step in?
Yeah. Nope.
You can, but not now.
Because I… my… I’m…
dealing with my brother.
He’s in a wheelchair,
from a rugby thing.
It will only take a second.
I’m just putting him to bed now.
Alright, okay, well, um-
I can come back tomorrow evening.
- Yeah. Absolutely tomorrow. Tomorrow is perfect, yeah.
Okay.
I could be here for seven.
You don’t need to thank me.
Um- uh- I know this looks...
- Hi.
Yeah, hello,
I’m Pierce, this is Mark,
and we know this looks really um- unusual
and suspicious and horrible and… We just-
Can you please just
not be judgmental
and just please listen
to what we have to say.
Are you okay?
Is this okay?
And we- we just…
Mark, I can’t… I can’t do it anymore Mark.
I can’t, I can’t.
- Okay.
I’m- I- Can you please tell this woman
what has happened
in this flat. Okay?
And… I’m gonna make tea, I’m gonna make tea
And I’m so sorry,
for hitting you.
I don’t hit people.
I- I- I- I’m very, very sorry.
Mark will explain everything.
Everything is okay, basically.
Um- um- The situation uh…
here is that…
um- there are six people in this flat
and uh- three of those people,
or half of us,
uh- have passed away
and by accident and separately.
Um- That’s Sally, my ex girlfriend.
This is David and my brother,
that’s his chair, by the way.
And um- um- Jack is in the porch, in the blankets,
And he owns the house.
And...
Um- and,… oh, and the dog.
Jersey, the dog.
Corridor hallway, yeah.
The first room on the right here,
this is Sally’s bedroom and
it used to be our bedroom
till I moved in with David and…
me and Sally hadn’t been really getting on.
And then this is where Jack died.
Um- he was fixing this
standing on this.
Screwdriver.
Mark, she hasn’t a clue,
what you’re talking about. Show her.
Wait.
Here.
- Standing like this.
No, walk it through. Go in from the beginning.
Go on go on, go on, go over there.
Okay, wobbly stool.
Right, wobbly stool, very wobbly. Death trap
Come on in there, Mark.
Landlord comes in, he gets up,
he’s got a deadly screwdriver.
There!
Go on. Don’t mind me, do it, do it.
Screwing away, screwing away.
Really wobbly,
wobbly, still wobble, wobble, wobble.
Oh… but down, he’s down. Get down. Like so.
Fucking you’ll be dead.
Lie down, lie down, lie down.
Just don’t mind the blood, please.
No, like Jack was.
Turn the other way, turn the other way. Yeah.
No, Mark, come on, reel around, reel around.
Don’t get in the blood, please.
Just put your back here... That’s it.
Okay, so he hits the floor,
sends the screwdriver in,
he’s turning around, he’s flailing around, he’s dead.
Just like that.
We think.
You wanna ask us anything?
She doesn’t.
So then entered Sally.
We’re in the bathroom.
Perplexed.
She goes straight into de sitting room,
sees David, whatever,
falls. Clarinet stand.
Okay.
Thank you.
I mean you must s- you must
come across situations where,
things are quite
what they seem.
Please, say something.
- I told you.
Anything.
What’s your name?
It’s useless.
Can we have a word outside?
You might?
If I let you go,
could you give me your word,
that you wouldn’t mention
any of these to your colleagues?
I can’t promise
you that, Mark.
This isn’t working.
That woman in there doesn’t believe us
and neither would anyone else believes us.
You’re probably right.
Probably nothing.
I have gambled a lot, okay?, and that is
a fucking one in a hundred million chance.
So, we have to get
practical, agreed?
There is a very slim chance,
that we can both
still get out of this, but...
and I nearly have it…
I nearly have it.
But for that to happen, she has to go.
What?
She fucked it up.
I fucked it up. Its my problem.
It’s our problem.
And I’m gonna deal with it.
Hey.
- What are you doing?
Addressing it.
Give me that.
I haven’t done anything wrong
on purpose, so I’m not paying for it.
Pierce, you’ve gone a little bit funny.
Pierce! Pierce!
Oh! Stuck!
Pierce!
Let me out, Pierce!
Please, open the door!
Open the door!
I’m warning you!
Right, fuck.
Pierce!
Don’t touch her, Pierce.
Keep your fucking hands off her!
Pierce, I want you to go now.
Get out, please.
You alright?
I don’t know what to do now.
I… um-
I have not any luck.
I have not any luck at all.
That body, the Croatian, in the Canal...
Was that you?
28, come in, over.
28, please report
to base, over.
What you would have
from today, is
good story for your script.
Who do you want to play you?
- Me, I’m playing me.
You’re too old.
- But someone who plays clarinet.
Someone who gives fantastic loser.
What was that?
Is she dead?
Uh… I borrowed these trousers,
‘cause mine were covered in forensics.
Okay.
Where are you going?
- I’m going for a pint.
For a pint?
- Yeah.
You wanna come?
Yeah.
I don’t really know if that’ll be appropriate.
Well, I just thought it might be the last
chance for a while because, you know, jail.
Yeah.
Okay, iI’ll phone the police
and you go for a pint.
Yeah, you phone the police
and I’ll go and have a pint,
and I don’t really know,
which pub or anything... so...
I’ll get a cab
where they can find me...
I don’t… I don’t know, I can’t, I can’t
I can’t really think right now, so um…
Okay.
Pierce, what are you doing here?
- Hi, hi, Frances.
I’ve only finished work now.
Fucking mental.
You know one of them days?
- I do, yeah.
Everybody has a dark side, everybody has a dark side,
Not many people die
by chandelier, Mark, die by chandelier, Mark.
Is he dead because you… did the murder?...
did the murder?… did the murder?...
Cut them up.
with a chainsaw.
And bury them.
It’s kind of meant to be a comedy, Frances.
You said it was black.
I did… It is, yes, very black.
Set the house on fire!
Um- The police will find out, though.
- How?
You know, forensics, post mortems and all that.
It’s a fucking film.
Who cares?
Uh- You know…. the…
anoraks and geeks. Students.
- Fuck them.
You have to keep these things,
um- real, you know,
because people get upset.
A really hot fire.
An explosion.
I know, I will, yeah, I’ll will
I’ll try to work that in, but... yeah.
My granddad died in a house fire.
He was only identified
because the ring he was wearing, jewelry luck,
forensics, me hole.
It’s not just the most
perfect plan ever?
So, you’re in?
Yeah, except for one little detail,
which is quite a big detail.
One, two, three, up!
Mark! Mark!
Come in!
Gently, gently.
Okay.
Watch his head.
Wait, wait.
Okay, we get one shot at this.
If it goes like the rest
of today, the car won’t explode.
Yeah.
A motorist will die,
a single mom….
Yeah.
Or a bus full of orphans, alright.
Let us check them again.
Alright, come over. It’s the last step, the last making.
- I’m not doing this.
Mark.
- Pierce!
Right, missus.
- I object to this, Pierce!
I’ve a moral problem with that.
We’re not throwing her under a truck.
Don’t get all vegetarian
on me now.
We… We killed this lady.
I’m not throwing her under a truck.
The window killed her.
I’m not throwing her under a truck.
- W… What do you want to do?
You know, I mean, you want
to b- b- b- b… boil her down
or shoot her into space?
For fuck’s sake, Mark.
There’s only so many...
Well, we should bury her.
Have you seen the time?
You know how long it takes,
To bury a human being?
I can’t do it, I’m out.
Something else.
You’ve... Right.
I don’t even want to talk about this anymore.
Go in the kitchen, put on
a pair of kitchen gloves, okay?
And wash up.
Can you handle that?
And I’ll deal with everything else.
How’s that sound?
Fine.
- Yeah. I thought you might like that.
So here we go. Run.
Hey, Mark, do you have anything left
of your parents?
You know, inheritance,
legacy, what’s it called?
Or life insurance?
You know, ‘cause this costs money.
this kind of thing, I’m a carer now.
Or- or what about a pension?
You know them
old’s pensions, do you have any pensions?
This is actually quite good form.
Mark?
You okay?
I think so.
Good costume. Right David.
Want me to do that?
Now.
Fucking hell!
- Yeah, I know.
So now, I don’t think
this place looks like a
crime scene anymore.
I can’t think of
anything else we can do.
Um. I can phone the police
or we can let them come to us.
Or… um-
Or… I mean, I don’t know what are we doing?
I don’t know.
We could watch something.
Does he take sugar?
- Who?
David, you.
No.
I’m gonna make some tea.
I’m gonna give you a straw,
because you’re gonna need
to practice with a straw.
Wait, wait.
It’s my agent.
- You’re not available.
Hello? Mark’s phone.
No, hi, hi Terry.
this, no, he’s not available,
he’s um- he’s due back,
actually,
he’s been a while.
Yeah, sure.
Okay, yeah.
Oh, great!
Good, good.
Yeah, definitely, yeah.
He’ll be delighted, yeah.
All right, Terry. Good luck.
What?
Do you remember the concerned neighbour?
- Yeah.
You didn’t get that.
- Of course I didn’t.
They want you to play the husband.
Huh, do they?
Is that a big part?
Six weeks filming, in London
and a bit of Spain.
I told you, that’s great.
That would have been a cracking gig.
Yeah.
That’s the police.
This is it.
I’m Pierce. A friend of Mark’s,
looking after his brother.
Maybe there’s been
some mistake?
My God, I didn’t even
get to say goodbye.
Fuck!
Line!
- Cut!
End-board, 24, take 5, end-board.
That was really good until there.
No, no. It’s just… It’s just not right now. It’s just…
You know the wrong of that.
- Yeah, really good.
You need retouchment?
- It was really good.
No, thanks.
- No make-up, no make-up.
Pierce, when we’re gonna do my close-ups?
You? That was, you know, like what we said earlier.
Take a break, okay?
You...
- Two minutes, man. Brilliant, brilliant.
You do this amazing thing with
your eyes, and the whole body.
It’s just- you know, it just feels,
I need more time,
to react or something.
I need some more lines,
you know? And yes, I’ve…
Look, are you
gonna go with this?
Flower pot falling on a cop?
- Yeah!
Do you not have something that’s
just a little bit more realistic?
I mean, I don’t buy it,
The audience is not gonna buy it,
And the cops aren’t gonna buy it.
- Oh, they did.
I mean they would, they could.
that’s what they would do. I’m sorry, that’s what they would do.
Um-, um- But the line is out like that.
you know, that’s easy, that… to change it, change that, change that
I mean, listen, the thing is...
I swear I make this the best possible here,
you know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah, absolu- yeah..
- That’s really a good part, you know.
And I think it’s very important for my character,
to rein and get us across.
And if we do
get us across.
then we can get a really, really good movie,.
- Yeah.
So, if you just wanna have
a look at the scene or something lie that,
jig it around, and just come to me,
and we just… I’m gonna write in,
and then we shoot again.
Fair enough?
- Yeah, yeah. All right.
Thanks a lot.
- Good work. Cheers, Johnny.
Good.
Get it next time,
Jonathan, okay?
Yeah.
Keep that energy.
This is such rubbish.
He cannot emote, you know that?
Anytime you ask him to do anything
he fucking collapses.
And shows us the script.
He would understand the script, 
if he didn’t just read his own lines.
You know what it is?
It’s pretty Hollywood bullshit.
And you hear about them people
and you think, they can’t be that bad.
And then you meet them and
they just blow your mind with how bad they are.
He’s like a child, without the good bit.
Are you okay?
I have to get back to this, I have to carry on with this.
Here Hugh! Who’s got Hugh?
Hugh is there...
What?
- Hugh, Hugh.
Hugh, at the top. When you’re there,
don’t stand there.
Why?
- Because…
