When you get that break...
...you take it, right?
Right.
But when you get that break,
and you reach the top...
...savour it, take it all in.
And let 'em suck your dick while
you tell them how wrong they were...
...for not believing you
in the first place.
Then get out.
Quit. Exit.
Make sure you leave them wondering.
I was watching the Learning Channel
the other day...
...and there was a special
on Buffalo Bill.
You know,
the great Wild West showman.
For years, this guy was the shit.
I mean, he helped tame the Wild West.
He made a lot of money doing it.
But he didn't get out in time,
you know.
He tried to hold on.
You just can't do that.
You see, at the age of 70...
...Bill still did Wild West shows
but for other guys' circuses...
...cos he was dead broke. Big mistake.
You used to have to prop
the old bastard on his horse...
...he'd do a lap
around the centre ring...
...then they'd help him off his horse
and put him to bed for the night.
Real fucking impressive, Bill.
Well, not me.
This is it. After tonight, I'm done.
No-one's propping me on a pony
when I'm 70.
Keep the boom-boom jungle music down
to a reasonable level, all right?
Define reasonable level, Partridge.
It's a fucking nightclub.
I don't have to define it.
I'm gonna be here to enforce it.
You're gonna be here?
I... I thought you were taking off
for the night.
Well, I changed my mind, OK?
I'm already regretting letting you
talk me into this after-hours crap.
This is my club,
so I'm gonna be here, all right?
- Sure, whatever.
- Yeah, that's cool.
Good.
Get a fucking thesaurus if you
need it better explained to you.
This ain't cool, man,
we can't have him here.
He's gonna wreck
the whole fucking plan, Ben!
We rented the space.
That...
...shitty... assneck!
Don't worry about it, Rikki.
We're in way over our heads,
you know that, Ben?
This is too big, it's too
complicated. It's not gonna end good.
I said don't worry, OK?
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you. You trust me, right?
We're fucked.
This is the most nuts thing
you ever thought of.
It's too risky, and I don't care
what Gregory wants, OK?
And now we can't play the music loud?
Let's just go back to grifting.
Rikki, how do you think
Gregory would react...
...if we told him "You know what?
We're not gonna steal the statue"?
Huh?
We end up like Ching One-Eye,
that's how.
I'll take care of Partridge.
Hey, Partridge, I need
a big black marker, you got one?
I saw the way you and that
little shit looked at each other...
...when I said I was gonna be here.
You two are planning on breaking all
sorts of laws tonight, aren't you?
I see anything
that could get me shut down...
...underage drinking, noise, drugs...
...I am pulling the plug
on your asses!
Good. Black marker. May I?
And when I say "Turn the music down,"
you say "How much, Mr Partridge?"
- You got it?
- Relax, OK? Good God!
The DJ we hired is really mellow,
a real peace, love, kind of...
Are you done fucking with me?!
...guy.
I'll be right back.
Why did you shove him?
I didn't. I was just asking him
not to touch my records.
I was just trying to help him
carry them inside.
And that involved touching them,
didn't it?
All right, now that we're even,
who the hell are you?
Is that, like,
some kind of a trick question?
- Where's DJ Max?
- He couldn't make it.
People are coming to hear DJ Max.
His name's all over the flyers.
- All right, what's your name?
- Steve Moulding.
No, I mean your DJ name.
Oh, oh, my DJ name.
That'll be Steven Moulding.
Look, asshole...
...you need a DJ name,
like... DJ Max has.
Who the fuck wants to hear Steven
Moulding? I don't. Do you, Rikki?
Mm-mm.
Fuck you.
All right, DJ Fuck You it is. Rikki?
Bye-bye, Rikki.
Bye-bye, DJ... Fuck You.
I want you to play the red record
at 1.45am tonight.
Then play the blue one at 1.55.
Fuck it up,
and I'll shoot your family.
Have a good set.
Did you just grab his balls, Ben?
- Why, are you jealous?
- Yes.
X marks the spot.
OK, one more review,
then it's show time. Betty?
OK, the bank alarm system
is divided into three parts.
Two of them I can override
in my sleep.
Only the third one concerns us.
It's a sonic detector.
Once 6.0 is reached
on this vibration actuator...
...the vibrations cause
that third alarm to shut itself down.
For every precaution, there's
an equal and opposite weakness.
Case in point -
there's a bank behind this wall.
Three separate levels of alarms.
Unbreachable, right?
Wrong. Betty used to work
for a software company...
...designing security systems
for some asshole...
...who couldn't keep his hands
off her software.
She got her revenge, though.
She discovered a bug in this
particular bank's security system...
...and tonight, she's exploiting it
to make us all rich.
She may not be a seasoned crook,
but where she lacks experience...
...she makes up for
in heart and moxie.
And that counts for a lot in my book.
As long as we keep that party
upstairs loud as hell, we're fine.
Keep the music and the crowd hoppin',
and the alarm is totally neutralised.
At 11, once the vibrations from the
club neutralise that third alarm...
...I start drilling into the
alarm nest in the circuit panel...
...so Betty can reach the first two
alarm systems and take them off line.
Jake Nealson was big on
the metal scene in the late '80s.
Pyro guy, worked
on all the huge tours.
Then grunge came along
and Jake found himself tending bar.
But tonight, Jake makes
his glorious return to pyrotechnics.
He's gonna put a new door
in the wall...
...and, uh, hopefully
not kill us all in the process.
OK, so maybe
he's not a real demolitions man...
...but at least he doesn't
owe allegiance to Mr Gregory...
...like every other real bomb guy
on this coast.
And I gotta tell ya, underneath
that crunchy chocolate shell...
...Jake's a big, warm nougat of a guy.
Then, once Betty's
got those two down...
...l'll blow the wall to the bank,
and in goes Jeffrey.
2am, after Jake opens
the new door in the wall...
...I hang a clothesline,
go in over the sensors.
Jeffrey's our box man.
His family's owned the Pinkerton Safe
company for four generations.
Jeffrey grew up assuming he was next
in line to take over the business...
...but his father felt that Jeffrey
was a superstitious little fuck-up...
...so the old man left the company
to Jeffrey's younger sister.
Jeffrey swore he'd get his revenge...
...by breaking into every safe
his family ever designed.
More or less proving his father
right, come to think of it.
Anyway, he's gonna get a little
closer to his goal tonight. I hope.
3.50am, I'm on my way out of
the vault with the goods in my bag.
4.30am, I get the bag to Gregory...
...and we are rich.
By the time the rave ends in the
morning, and the alarms go off...
...we'll be long gone.
Here.
OK, Rikki, like we talked about.
You get the rave loud, man,
we keep it loud.
This has got to read above 6.0.
If it drops below that, the alarm
goes off and we're fucked.
6.0, man.
You can do this tonight,
I know you can.
And this is it. We retire.
Hey, hey, girls.
I'll see you... Oh, thank you.
Nice pants, asshole.
Hey, Ben, who's Ching One-Eye?
One of Gregory's guys
a few years ago.
You know how he got that name?
He lost an eye?
Come on, man, what the fuck?
You don't get the name Ching One-Eye
cos you lost a fucking ear, right?
Right.
What I'm saying is,
do you know how he lost that eye?
No.
He tried to double-cross Gregory,
that's how.
Remember Tommy Fingernails?
- Yeah, sure.
- Same thing.
Ching used to have both eyes,
Tommy used to have fingernails.
You fuck with Gregory,
you get a nickname.
I don't want a nickname, Rikki.
- Do you want a nickname?
- No, I don't want a nickname either.
Good. When we get in there, don't say
shit unless he talks to you, OK?
OK.
- You ready for this?
- I'm ready.
Mr Gregory.
Hello, Benjamin.
I see you brought a friend.
That's nice.
Please, sit.
So...
...this is Rikki...
...Nice Pants.
Ever had your fortune told, Rikki?
Uh...
No... n-not really.
Give me your hand.
Sorry, bad fortune.
Ow!
- Ben!
- Get off me!
All right!
I'll be outside.
I asked you to meet me here alone.
I was very specific on that request,
Benjamin.
Consider that a friendly warning.
Rikki reminds me of your brother.
I still feel badly
about what happened to Kevin.
He had potential.
It pains me to force you
to pay off his debts like this...
...but I am a businessman, after all.
Examples must be made.
This will go smoothly.
So long as you're sure
the statue's there.
The safety deposit vault next to it
is one of my own.
I watched them move the statue in.
It's there.
After this...
...l'm no-one's errand boy any more.
I'm cleaning the slate tonight.
Well, you've talked a good game,
Benjamin...
...but now it's time to deliver,
isn't it?
It's all under control.
Why don't you go back to your place?
Wait for you at home?
I don't think so.
- This place is 24 hours, right?
- Yeah, but it puts you...
Then shut the fuck up.
If I want to be here, I'll be here.
It's now ten o'clock.
I'll be here until 5am.
I expect you to be sitting
in this booth...
...handing me the statue
at that time.
You OK?
Uh, yeah, I'll be all right.
Let me look.
I'm sorry, man.
I didn't know he was gonna pull
any of this shit.
Let's get you cleaned up
when we get back. Let's go.
There's another thing, Rikki.
Gregory's gonna stay here all night.
He thinks we're gonna
try and dash with the statue.
Oh, shit.
Oh, but... Well, we're not, right?
Of course not. This has got to go
silky fucking smooth tonight, Rikki.
No, I don't think so.
Let me in the fucking club,
you piece of shit!
- What's wrong?
- Fake ID.
- No, it's not.
- Sorry, you can't come in.
That's my real ID. Bite me.
This doesn't look
like just a dye job to me.
See, you're a brunette
and this ID's for a natural blonde.
Oh, yeah?
Does this look brunette to you?!
Huh?!
Don't be a dick, Dirk. Let her in.
Oh, God.
What's wrong, Vanessa?
Ben McGewen.
Asshole.
Is he gonna follow me around
all night... again?
When do you think
he's gonna get the hint?
I dunno. The break through his
windshield wasn't enough of a hint?
Cool. Looks like he's over you.
Asshole.
Hey, Ben, did you order
some transvestites?
Uh, cos they're here.
Oh, the S&M show.
It's midnight already?
Got a place for us girls
to put our faces on?
Yeah. Glad you're here.
Rikki, take them backstage.
OK.
Just curious, how do you hide
your dick and your balls?!
What the fuck is that?
What?
I'm not listening to that shit
while I work. Turn it off.
I can't. I have to have it on
to work. It soothes me.
Well, blow jobs soothe me, but you're
not giving me one while I work.
Not funny. That's not funny.
You know that, right?
I gotta play this or I can't work.
You're a little bitch,
do you know that, Jeffrey?
- You're a big fucking Mongoloid!
- Both of you, shut the...
Shut the fuck up. Just leave
the music on if it helps him, Jake.
Damn.
- Now what?
- Fortune fish.
Fortune fish?
What the fuck is a fortune fish?
Fortune fish.
Never lies.
I use it before every job.
Oh. Good. For a second there
I thought you were insane.
It's good to know
you're just a fuckhead.
Seriously, three years ago,
I was with these guys...
...gonna break into the World Bank
of Commerce down on Fourth.
Before we started,
I consulted the fortune fish, and...
And?
And what?
- It flipped.
- What's that mean?
Doom. Certain failure.
I refused to go.
It went on without me,
and guess what?
They're all doing ten to 20
in Chino...
...because they, like yourselves...
...scoffed at the power
of the fortune fish.
Uh-huh.
Shit. Oh, shit.
Man, it curled. Danger.
Proceed with extreme caution.
Shit!
How are the, uh...
...girls?
Fine. They're getting dressed.
They said they have
a snake guy coming.
Why do transvestites
have a snake guy coming?
Part of the show.
There's a lot I don't know
about transvestites, isn't there?
Yep.
Oh, my God.
Ben!
Ben, this place is stocked
with beautiful women...
...and you're reading
National Geographic? Come on.
You wanna see what we're stealing...
...or are you just gonna
talk shit all night?
What does Gregory want with it
anyway? Is he gonna sell it?
No, it's not the money
in this one for Gregory.
Listen up, I got a story for you.
Now, there's four statues total, OK?
Ping-I, god of rivers,
Fei Lien, god of wind...
...Yen Lo Wang, god of earth,
and Chu-Jung, god of fire.
The four elements.
Are you listening to me? You're doing
this, I don't know what that is.
- Yeah, I'm listening.
- Sure?
Yeah, yeah.
The last man
to own all four statues...
...was Emperor Han Wu-Ti of the
Han Dynasty, over 2,000 years ago.
Legend has it that when
he controlled the four statues...
...he was master of the four elements.
Like He-Man?
No, He-Man
was master of the universe.
Anyway, Gregory's collected
the other three.
When we get Chu-Jung, he'll be the
first man to own them all since 87BC.
I didn't know he went in for that
supernatural, superstitious stuff.
He doesn't, but the Chinese mafia
he deals with every single day...
...sure as hell does.
Gregory knows that.
He knows if he has all four statues,
it fucks with their heads.
Vanessa's here, you know that?
You know, I'm telling you a story
here, you're talking about Vanessa.
- Yeah, I noticed.
- So are you gonna go for it?
- Again?
- No, Rikki.
Do you mind if I go for it?
Where'd you go?
Hey. We hit 6.0 about 45 minutes ago.
What the hell is this? Drugs?
There's no drug use in bank robbery,
Betty.
Don't blame me.
The shit belongs to stoner boy.
Excuse me? Betty, bite me.
I work better stoned.
Besides, we had to calm down Jeffrey.
Why did Jeffrey need calming down,
Jake?
Fortune fish.
"Danger.
Proceed with extreme caution."
Ben, you gotta talk to Partridge,
man. He's gonna shut down the club.
What? Why?
I don't know,
he's just really pissed. Come on.
There you are, you piece of shit.
You wanna tell me why anybody
in their right mind...
...would need to listen to music
this fucking loud?
- What?
- I took a big gamble...
...lettin' you talk me into
this after-hours bullshit, McGewen.
I'm not licensed for this.
I get one call to the cops...
...they shut me down forever.
- This is Chinatown, Partridge.
- No-one fucking lives here.
- I don't care, it's over.
- What about our deal?
- Fuck the deal, and fuck you.
I'm pulling the plug.
Oh, what, are you gonna hit me
with the bottle now?
Ow! You fucking did it!
What's the matter with you?!
Ow! You son of a bitch!
Shit, Ben.
What? I just can't have him
shutting the music off.
Just find some rope
and tie the sack of shit up.
I used to collect silver dollars
when I was a kid.
I don't collect them.
This is my lucky silver dollar.
You've got two lucky silver dollars?
No, only one.
I just don't know which one.
See, I had a lucky silver dollar...
...and I kept it with me
wherever I went.
Then someone gave me a plain old
non-lucky silver dollar...
...and they accidentally got mixed up.
Same year, same mint.
So only one
is your lucky silver dollar?
Right.
But you can't spend either because
you don't know which one is lucky.
- Right.
- Well, gosh, Jeffrey...
...why don't you just ask
the fortune fish which one it is?
Jeez, just when I think
you can't be a bigger retard...
What the hell is that?
- Someone's on the rag.
- You got more electricity...
- Fuck! See?
- That's not our fault, dear.
Your little houseboy
told us to do that.
How are we supposed to get gorgeous
for your floor show...
...without our hardware, honey?
Look, Mitchell, I can't have
the power going out on me tonight.
Unplug that mess and get some
extension cords from the bartender.
- Jesus Christ, Ben.
- You know what?
We're getting ready here!
- Hey, Ben, man.
- What the fuck?
I was wondering if you've seen Chad.
- Chad?
- Yeah.
I don't know who you are.
How the fuck would I know Chad?
Oh, you'd know Chad if you saw him.
- Oh, I would?
- Yeah.
OK. Why don't you go back
to the lounge and sleep it off, pal?
OK.
All yours, Betty.
Wow, only an hour and a half late.
- Nice work, monkey man.
- I take shit from Ben. I like him.
I should have the foundation alarms
done in no time.
Make it quick. I was supposed to
blow those holes over an hour ago.
If we're gonna pull this off,
I gotta get the explosives in place.
Look, ass, you can't rush
system hacking.
I got a lot of logic to untangle.
It's not like making holes in walls
so stop busting my ovaries.
- Hey, race cars!
- What?
You know, race cars!
Hey.
Were you staring at my ass?
What? No, I...
I came down to get some smokes.
Are you having trouble
with the machine?
Yeah. I don't have enough change.
And, uh, you were hoping that the
machine would give you a packet...
...out of the goodness of its heart?
Mm-hm. It works. Sometimes.
Well, I happen to know
that that's a female machine...
...and your feminine wiles
won't work on it.
Mm.
Um, how come you've been
ignoring me all night?
What?
Are you kidding me?
Oh, my God.
Well, for one thing, I don't want
to replace another windshield.
And...
...l'm busy.
Busy?
I was, uh, kind of thinking...
Quarter.
Asshole.
- Oh, my God.
- I am the queen of truth or dare.
Thank you!
- You like that?
- Yeah, I did, yeah, wow.
You can go next if you want.
- How are we doing on that thing?
- Uh, great.
Um, no-one's called me
on my cell phone yet.
OK, Rikki.
You keep listening for that call.
Hey, you're next.
- Next what?
- We're playing truth or dare...
...and you're up.
No. I'm running a club here.
Kind of busy.
Truth or dare?
Truth.
OK.
I got one.
If you were allowed to commit
one completely immoral...
...culturally unacceptable
act of sin...
...and the next day
no-one would remember...
...what would you do?
Good question.
Chad!
Chad?
Chad!
Come on, Chad, let him go, man.
You're acting like an asshole!
You want me to take you home,
you keep it up, mister.
Come on, you're ruining
the weekend again.
Hey, Ben, how you doin'?
You got a snake problem here...
...but I can talk him down
if you just give me a second.
That gets him upset.
- You're getting into shit here.
- Ben, where you going, man?
- What's his name?
- Chad.
Whoa! Easy, man,
he's got a backbone for chrissakes.
Can't you, like, sing to him
or something? Sing a song.
Sing him the magic snake song.
It's all right,
just part of the show.
Come on, come on.
Just part of the show.
Whoa, heads up!
You all right?
Yeah.
This your wallet?
Yeah. Yeah.
Thanks.
It went in the vent.
- The snake went inside the vent.
- I got it!
Where does that vent go?
- Whoa.
- What the fuck?!
Shit!
Argh! Christ!
- You're not gonna believe this...
- Big snake, I know. Watch out.
It's gone.
It must've went back up in the vent.
- Ben?
- What?
Remind me never to piss you off.
Yeah, so, uh,
how's everything going down here?
It's good, Ben. It's good.
That's really funny.
Don't touch it.
Hello, Ben. Gregory wants to see you.
Now?
He didn't specify now.
Usually implied with Mr Gregory.
He'll have to wait.
No...
...now.
Look...
...if you fuck with me tonight...
...that may cause me
to make a mistake.
And if I make a mistake,
the bank alarms will go off...
...and if the bank alarms go off,
guess who Gregory's gonna blame.
Me.
And if he gets mad at me
and shoots me and I die...
...well, that's gonna suck.
After he shoots me and I die, he'll
ask you guys to take on my debt.
Yeah, you know how the system works.
So if you wanna fuck with me tonight,
fuck away.
Just get out those chequebooks,
boys.
- Boo!
- Argh!
Fucker.
This song sucks, man...
...but it's 1.45 and I'm playing it
just like you asked me to.
I need you to play it again later.
- No!
- I'll let you know when.
Dude, you're not listening to me!
The song blows, OK?
People are gonna think it's my mix
if I play this shit twice.
They're gonna think I'm shit!
I'll let you know
when to play it again.
Help me, Jesus, help me!
- Fill it to the top.
- All right.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- The name's Roy.
- Ben.
You know, Ben,
there's, uh, a Chinese myth...
...that says, uh, when a man
saves another's life...
...that man is indebted to him
forever.
Yeah, I think I saw something
on PBS about that.
So I... want you to know...
...if there's ever
anything you need...
...and I can help,
you just let me know, all right?
- All right, thanks.
- OK.
See you again, Ben.
Hey!
What the hell's going on, Ben?
Yeah.
Sorry about that scare.
Partridge is a real Method man.
One of those, uh, Stanislavskys.
Takes all types I guess, huh?
Yeah.
- Well, I'll see you around, Ben.
- OK.
What is it?
I gotta tell you something
about those guys.
What?
I can't breathe, man.
I can't breathe.
They're here for us, you know that?
They're gonna nail us, man.
- I... can't breathe, man.
- You're gonna be fine.
How can you tell me
I'm gonna be fine...
...and then tell me that there's
undercover feds out there, Ben? Huh?
They're gonna catch on to us and
they're gonna throw us in prison...
...and then I'm gonna get fucked
in my ass...
...by some hairy greaseball
named... named Otto.
I'm not gonna let Otto
fuck you in the ass.
You know what, you're not gonna
be able to help me fight Otto...
...because you're gonna be married on
a completely different cell block...
...bent over a sink.
Yeah, with soap and shit.
We're gonna look like doughnuts
by the time we get out on parole!
- Rikki...
- I can't do this, man.
I can't go out there and do this, OK?
We're not bank robbers, man!
Rikki, if we pull out now,
the alarms go off.
Besides, we don't know
that it's us that they're here for.
Oh, then why are they here
if they're not here for us, Ben? Huh?
Someone else robbing a bank tonight?
I dunno.
Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.
- Fuck.
Oh, my God! Oh!
Listen, cook your chicken.
It always chills you out.
I'll take care of this.
Relax and deal, Rikki.
I need you tonight.
I don't even want my chicken
any more, Ben!
Dirk, the line's all the way
down the street.
How come we're not staying full?
Cos we're getting a lot of fake IDs.
It's all like jailbait.
So? Let 'em in, man. Let 'em all in.
Huh? You're kidding?
- You know what? Come on, let's go.
- They'll shut us down!
They'll never come here again!
- What the hell are you doing?
- Single file.
You no have club no more!
Lots of groovers for you,
get drunk, be loud, be really loud!
OK, all right, there you go.
- You'll never promote a club again!
- I don't give a shit right now, man.
I'm winning.
You can't win. It's a loop, idiot.
You just go around it.
I'm ahead of you. I was always
the best at racing, I still am.
Three points!
What do you mean, three points?
Three points. I passed you,
that's three points.
Where the hell is that rule?
There's no points, it's racing.
It's the way I've always played it.
Wasn't three points, motherfucker.
Ha, I just passed you.
I get three points.
- No, you don't.
- Why not?
You bumped me. I get two more points.
Fuck you and your points!
There's no goddamn points.
You just pull the trigger
and make your car go around.
Oh, fucking... Thanks, asshole!
Take a chill pill. I'm trying to
make up some lost time here.
How am I supposed to work
with you picking on the autistic?
- Hey!
- You know what? Fuck both of you.
My cousin picked this up
in Mexico last week.
Says it works like a charm.
Right on, man. You're so thoroughly
immoral, you know that?
This just lets her express herself.
What's so immoral about that?
Yoo-hoo, Ben, baby, honey...
...can you zip me up?
Oh, my God, get back in there.
Can't wait to see what you guys
do with that thing.
Oh, Maurice? He got the night off...
...ever since you volunteered
your older friend...
...to be our bitch boy tonight.
There you are.
So what is it?
What's what?
What's your truth?
You can't stop something
you've already started.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Oh, shit.
Ben!
Hey, man, uh...
Hey, Kitten. Hi.
What is it, Rikki?
- Jake.
- Jake?
God.
Oh, hey, Ben.
How's it going, man?
What the fuck are you doing up here?!
Just taking a little break, man.
Rikki...
You're fucking fired!
You're kidding.
You can't do it without me.
Yeah, but we can't do it
with you now, can we?
What did you take?
Well, I... drank some, uh...
...drink.
I don't think that was gin
in that thing, though, Ben.
I feel love.
Fine, you work stoned, then.
Get in the basement, bitch.
Get in the basement, bitch!
All right.
OK, OK.
Fuck!
Hey, Ben!
Have you seen Jake?
I think I pissed him off.
Argh!
Agh! What? Jeffrey!
Holy shit!
Jeffrey!
Jeffrey!
- He's having an epileptic seizure.
- You're kidding.
Must be the lights. We gotta
stick something in his mouth...
...so he doesn't swallow his tongue,
like a spoon or a lighter.
Come on, whatever you got. Hurry up!
Go!
There.
Help me get him out, someplace
where the lights aren't so crazy.
- How about downstairs?
- No!
I mean, uh, how about outside?
He probably needs fresh air, right?
All right, let's go.
So, uh, thanks for the help in there.
Michael Frakes.
Ben McGewen.
We should really, uh,
get him to a hospital.
He's probably gonna be fine,
but he needs to see a doctor.
What?
Well, we can't take him
to a hospital.
Why the hell not? The poor guy
just had a fucking seizure.
Hold on.
There was this thing on Nova.
They discovered
a totally isolated clan of people...
...in a remote region of Greenland.
They were living in a technologically
medieval microculture.
The Untladhavns. Yeah, no kidding.
And when they sent in
this cultural anthropologist...
...he discovered
that these people never lied.
They didn't even have a word for it.
Hm.
That's great for them.
But I bet you the Untladhavns
never found themselves in an alley...
...with Jeffrey the epileptic being
held together by an FBI agent...
...only inches away
from discovering the robbery...
...that they meticulously planned
for six months.
So fuck the Untladhavns.
Christian Scientist.
- What?
- He's a Christian Scientist.
He doesn't believe in doctors, so
he'll refuse any treatment anyway.
He thinks God will take care of it.
You're kidding?
I wouldn't lie about
something like that.
Man.
Now what happened?
Don't ask.
Just make sure
he doesn't swallow his tongue.
Whatever.
Oh, shit.
I hate cats.
I had one once.
It never came to me when I called it.
It finally made me so mad
I drowned it in the kitchen sink.
That's amazing, isn't it?
That it could make me that mad.
When I say I want to see you,
I mean now.
Not in ten minutes,
not half an hour later. Now.
I just...
Shut up.
You're getting cocky, Benjamin.
And in this business,
to protect my interests...
...it doesn't behoove me
to have cocky underlings.
Do I make myself perfectly clear?
You may answer with one word.
- Yes.
- Good.
Now, then, I want a status report.
Everything's fine.
See? That wasn't so hard, was it?
Be back here at five.
OK, I'm done.
Better late than never.
Let's make those holes.
Let's make those holes!
How is that ape supposed to use
explosives in his condition?
Betty, shut up!
I work better stoned.
I dunno, he seems fine to me.
- Yeah, I vote he does it.
- Are you gonna be here when he does?
- Fuck you, no.
- I'm hungry.
Hey, Jeffrey.
Did you have a nice nap?
Do you wanna be a bank robber again?
How come you didn't tell me
you're an epileptic?
Because then
you wouldn't have hired me.
Wha!
That's some fucked-up shit.
Rikki, go back upstairs.
Everybody else, get back to work.
So I'm not fired?
No, Jeffrey, you're not fired.
You're just an asshole.
I'm starved too.
Can we get some chow first?
Fine. There's a Chinese place
across the street that delivers.
No, garlic chicken!
Garlic! Chicken, yes!
There you go.
Did I say pork?
No, I didn't.
Chicken. Thank you.
I want four orders of that.
Uh, two with won ton soup.
We're at 616, Empire Avenue.
Across the street from you!
Oh, thank you. Yeah.
That's Ben McGewen.
Hi. What you doin'?
Food. You having a good time?
Not yet, hot pants.
Wanna take a walk?
- Thanks, but I'm kinda busy...
- You haven't answered your truth.
And I'd say your time's up.
So that means I get a dare.
Do you wanna hear my dare?
Really?
Well, you know, it's, um...
Yeah, I'm kinda busy, so it's...
I'm working.
You know, we really can't do this.
Sure we can. Watch.
Um...
Oh, OK.
I deserve this.
Actually, Kitten, Kitten, stop, OK?
Trust me, you got no idea
how bad I want this.
- But not now.
- Then what about this?
- No.
- Ben, hi.
Uh, I was just coming down to, uh,
see when the Chinese food was coming.
But it kinda looks like
you're already gettin' dim sum.
Fuck you, Rikki, it's nothing.
It's nothing?
Fuck you, Ben.
Hey, Kitten.
We're good. Let's do it.
It's that time.
Play that record again.
I think I might've lost it.
Oh, well, I'll play something good.
Just play it again!
That's the song.
We're still online. We're good.
Yep, one more explosion,
we got ourselves a new door.
Knock, knock.
Sorry about your soup, man.
Totally got jostled on the dance
floor and it got kinda screwed.
- Who the hell are you?
- You ordered Chinese food, right?
Well, that's me.
Chinese food delivery guy.
- Here.
- Scott, is that you?
Jeffrey Jay? Holy shit, man!
Oh, wow! How long has it been?
Six years!
- So what are you doing now?
- Still robbing banks.
Wow. So what are you doing here?
Robbing a bank.
No shit. Hey, can I watch?
No, fuck off!
He can't, he's seen everything.
You know what?
Maybe I should fuck off.
No, go ahead. Have a seat
and have some kung pao chicken.
I said, have a seat
and have some kung pao chicken!
You be good, now.
Ahh. Ohh.
Woo!
Holy shit.
Woo! Oh.
- Hoo-hoo!
- What's up?
Oh, I'll tell you what's up.
Guess what I just did?
Starts with the letter F,
ends with the letter UCKED.
No shit.
Oh, yeah.
You dog!
So, who is she?
Huh? Oh, oh. She's a... just some...
this hot, hot little blonde girl.
You know, hot.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.
- These dirty little meat flowers...
...they'll just, like, strip and jump
your donkey anywhere, won't they?
- Apparently, yeah.
- No shit, yeah!
So is she young?
Yeah, kinda. Phew.
I like 'em young. You like 'em young?
I like 'em when they're young...
...but they know their way around,
you know what I mean?
- Yes, sir, I do know.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
So where is she now?
El bano.
Oh, yeah. Oh!
Cos I was thinking, uh, maybe I'll
get a little sloppy seconds, huh?
Rikki, I'm still purring.
Sure thing, Kitten.
- Susan.
- Susan?
Daddy?
Daddy?
Ben! Please!
Oh, God, help me. Help me!
You wanna dance?
We'll dance.
We're not done.
We're going back to el bano.
You filthy fucking whore!
Piece of shit, cock-sucking bastard!
Who called her meat flower?
You did. I didn't...
Hey!
What did you do, Rikki?
What did he do?
Ben, you wanna know what he did?
He had sex
with my 16-year-old daughter!
16?
- Daughter?
- Yes!
I swear to God,
she said she was 17. Ben, I swear...
Motherfucker. You stupid fuck!
This music sucks, man!
Can you play something more nasty?
I wanna get nasty!
He's fucking with the song!
It's like you fucked part of me!
Do you understand that?
He's fucking with the song!
Don't move, I'll be right back.
Where are you going?
Fuck it!
What the hell was that?
Sounds like it came from downstairs.
- Beats me, I'll go check it out.
- I'll go with you.
That's OK, I got it covered.
What's the matter? You got a dead
body downstairs or something?
Fuck!
What the hell is going on in here?
Oh, hey, there.
Got here as soon as you guys called
about those electrical surges.
- And who are you?
- Sparkz Electronics.
You guys hear that?
Tiny little electrical pop.
Probably sounded
loud as hell upstairs.
This fuse box has fuses in it,
and wires that go up.
And... over here is a... air duct.
And that air duct
is right behind the fuse box.
Together, they probably made it
very loud upstairs...
...when the surges happened.
I'm gonna do some overtime on this.
I'll have it ready for the kitchen
in the morning.
I guess that explains it.
These are fuse lists.
I'll go over them.
Figure out which one it is.
OK.
- OK.
- OK.
- That's 11 C.
- Mm-hm. Good. Good.
Who the fuck is this?
He came to deliver the food and saw
everything. I couldn't let him go.
What the hell's going on up there
with the record, anyway, man? Rikki?
Hey, leave Rikki alone, all right?
Oh, shit. Rikki!
Wait a minute!
That old Chinese myth
you told me about.
Back off, Ben!
I saved your life!
I saved your life, Roy.
Give me his.
Will you let go of me,
please? Thank you.
Oh, Ben, I think...
This doesn't end here, right?
I'm a federal agent, and I'm
arresting his ass for statutory rape.
- Come on, we're going home.
- No! Daddy... Stop it!
- OK, stop! No hitting!
- Fuck you, Ben!
This is all your fault anyway!
If I tell you
the truth or dare answer...
...would you leave, for your dad?
Hey, Ben.
I got her number, though.
That's good, Rikki.
I got her phone number.
What was the truth you told her
to get her to leave?
I told her I wished it had been me
instead of you...
...that got to be with her.
I'm sorry, man, I...
It's just... I hadn't been laid
in over a year. You know?
And stuff like this doesn't happen
to guys like me every day.
Don't worry about it.
Nobody's dead.
Yet.
I'm such a complete loser.
I said don't sweat it.
You know, things never went
Kevin's way either.
But he meant well.
That's what counts, Rikki.
Ben?
Who shot him?
I don't know.
- Jin Sun.
- McGewen.
I thought I told you if I caught you
back in Chinatown again...
...l'd mail you back to Gregory
one piece at a time.
Who does Gregory think he is?
I had an agreement
with that seipop guy.
Chinatown's mine.
What can I say, Jin Sun?
You got me by the balls here.
I'm just doing
what Gregory tells me to do.
So let me get this straight.
You get that statue
out of the bank vault at 4.30...
...but Gregory doesn't expect you
until five.
Yeah.
Let me tell you what I'm gonna do
for you, McGewen, because I like you.
I'm gonna let you finish your little
gig in my neighbourhood tonight...
...but you cut me in on the deal.
I'm pretty sure Gregory
won't go for it.
He won't have a choice if I have the
statue when he gets here. Will he?
I guess we have a deal.
I'll see you at 4.30am, Benjy.
Hey. Thank you for saving us
back there.
Oh, no problem.
Anything for a Theta brother.
You do realise you're an accessory
to a pretty major felony, right?
That's cool.
Just checking.
OK, Jeffrey. We are way the hell
behind schedule, so let's make time.
- You know which vaults, right?
- Yeah, of course!
Ben? Are you down here?
Hey.
Would you like to go for a drink?
Oh, yeah. I thought you'd never ask.
What are you guys doing in here?
Try to shove my head in a toilet
again, asshole.
You look upset.
Gee, you think?
You know, you worry too much.
If you'd just relax a little bit...
...things would come to you.
Can I ask you a question?
Mm-hm.
I've been trying to get your
attention for, like, a year now.
And other than that night you
threw rocks and shit at my car...
...you haven't shown me
the least bit of interest.
And?
Why tonight?
Of all the nights on
the Christian calendar, why tonight?
I don't know.
There's just something about you
tonight that's kind of cute.
- I mean, I may just...
- You know what?
I hate you.
Yeah. I hate you.
I hate women like you.
I hate women that look like you.
I hate mannequins
that wear clothes...
...that look like clothes
that you might wear.
I hate your perfume,
and everyone that wears it.
I hate your friends
because they get to be near you...
...but most of all, I hate your bed.
Because every night, I know
that's right where I will never be.
PBS, last Tuesday night.
The Australian outback.
There's this bird
called the orindinkie.
You've heard of black widow spiders
eating their lovers after they mate.
That's nothing on the orindinkie.
You see, just after mating,
the male chills out, takes a nap.
That's when the female comes up,
rips open its chest...
...and eats its heart.
Scientists think she does this
to ensure he never mates again...
...giving her offspring
a better chance of life.
Me?
I got my own theory.
I think it's because
she's just a bitch.
So fuck you.
Fuck you.
It's empty.
It's empty.
No, Jeffrey, don't you do it. Don't.
Put the fish back!
No.
- Oh, no, no, no...
- Put it down, Jeffrey! Put it down!
Drop it!
- Argh!
- Retard!
Grrr!
You dick!
Ben? OK, uh...
Uh, look, Ben, you got a major
problem, man. The vault's empty.
What?!
Ohh!
Ow! I didn't even come yet,
you asshole!
Is he dead?
I don't think so.
If you look real close,
you can see the little fucker twitch.
- What about the second vault?
- No, he never got that far.
When he got to the vault where
the statue was supposed to be...
...and it was empty, he lost his shit.
He was fine until
he pulled that fish out.
Second vault? I thought you guys
were stealing a statue.
- We are.
- So the statue's in two safes?
No, the statue's in one vault.
The other vault has...
Wait a second.
Why am I explaining this to you?
- I don't know.
- OK.
Think.
The statue's got to be in here!
Betty, jump the system
and find out where they put it.
Look, I appreciate your help
but I'm giving you your out now.
Maybe you should get back to work.
The shit's about to hit the fan.
No way, man. Besides, they're closing
in a few minutes anyways.
Closing? What do you mean, closing?
It's a 24-hour restaurant.
Spray for bugs?
You sent me to a restaurant...
...that needs to close down
to spray for fucking bugs?
Do you know how I feel about
being this close to the scene?
It makes me very fucking
uncomfortable, Benjamin.
Mr Gregory,
you didn't have to come here.
I have things under control.
Why don't I bring it to your office
tomorrow morning?
You said yourself, you waited ten
years. You can wait another night.
I trust you just barely enough
to break into this bank...
...and get the statue for me.
I do not trust you to put the statue
in your car and drive it across town.
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
Look, if you're uncomfortable,
why don't you go someplace nearby?
You know there's not another place to
wait in Chinatown this time of night.
You knew that place
was shutting down, didn't you?
I know you, you little shit!
OK.
This office is yours.
I'll bring it to you once I get it.
You cross me...
...and you will wish you were dead,
McGewen.
Don't you get it, Rikki?
It's over.
We're not gonna get the statue.
Gregory's gonna kill me.
After he kills me, Jin Sun's gonna
find some way to bring me back...
...so he can kill me too.
It's over.
So you're quitting?
That's bullshit, Ben!
That's total bullshit, man!
A couple of months ago,
I was at your place.
I wanted to watch the Hustler
channel, but you made me sit there...
...and watch some shit fucking nature
special you had on, remember?
About a bunch of gazelle
or something, right?
It was some country I never heard
of-probably in Africa.
Oh, my God, Rikki. I'm gonna die.
Yeah, I know, OK?
Don't interrupt me any more,
I'll forget where I was going.
Anyway, um, the narrator
was this English guy...
...and he had a stick so far up his
ass he could probably taste pine.
He talked a lot of shit...
...most of which I forgot
before he was even done talking.
I mean, who knew
there was so much crap...
...to talk about fucking gazelle,
right? And who actually gives a shit?
- Are you making a point here?
- Yes!
You see...
...lions...
...eat gazelle.
And the gazelles
fucking hate that shit.
Now, this narrator guy was saying
that one day on the shoot...
...that a lion snuck up
on the cameraman, right?
This camera guy was, like, a native.
He's been doing this shit
all his life.
And the narrator said
that there was one sure way...
...to stop a lion from attacking you.
Don't turn and run.
See, that's what the gazelles do.
It doesn't work for them
and they get eaten anyway.
But this camera guy...
...he knew what to do.
He fucking charged that lion.
He just ran at that lion, stark
raving mad, screaming and shit.
He charged this fucking lion.
And you know what?
The lion...
...turned and ran.
Why?
I don't know.
You went into the kitchen
and I turned on the Hustler channel.
There was a special on
called Beaver Boat.
Um, just like any other fishing show.
You know? But not exactly.
Instead of two fat guys fishing,
it was two naked babes.
You'll never believe
what they used for bait, Ben.
Turns out something was wrong with
the air conditioning in the safe.
The statue's so old
they need to keep it at 60 degrees...
...so it doesn't deteriorate any more.
So they moved it down here
to a subbasement.
Controlled environment safes.
It's in safe B-263-54.
You can get to the subbasement...
...through this electrical conduit
in the floor here.
OK.
We got 20 minutes
to make everything happen.
Two safes to crack, no safe-cracker.
We could blow 'em open.
That's risky.
If you pop the vault doors off...
...and it falls,
it could set off the laser alarms.
No choice. We're out of options.
How much grease you got left, Jake?
Uh...
Two finger coils, for emergencies.
I'd say this just about counts. What
size doors are we talking about here?
Like wall safes.
One foot by one foot each, maybe.
And you got to pop a hole in
the floor to get to the subbasement.
I guess it'll do the trick.
Who goes? Jeffrey's fucked.
One of us.
I'll go.
I know the explosives.
Guess again.
You're too heavy.
Jeffrey only had that cord set
for 350 pounds.
- Well, you go, then.
- Someone's got to track the alarms.
- I stay with my laptop, pal.
- I can do it.
No offence, but when this
makes the books...
...as the most fucked-up bank job
in history...
...for all the mistakes that I did
make, I don't want to be credited...
...with sending the Chow-Wang food guy
in to blow the safe.
Ben, what do you weigh?
Just ten more minutes, I promise.
Hey.
Ben's just, um...
He's just getting the statue
ready for you.
He's cleaning it up and stuff.
Where the hell is Ben?
And what the hell is all this shit
about some safe being empty?
Look, bitch, I don't know who you are
or what you're cranked up on...
...but you better get out of here
right now.
Blow me, Rikki.
Tell Ben to fuck off, too.
That's, uh... drugs.
She's probably on some hard drugs.
All the hard drugs...
...that kids are doing these
days at these parties.
All right.
That's enough. Hold him down.
OK.
Which is the way down, Betty?
Shit.
Under Jeffrey.
Fuck me.
Michael, check out
the southeast door.
That could be our guy.
We're on.
Oh!
I'm gonna ask this once, that's all.
If you don't tell me
what Ben is up to right now...
...you're going to find out exactly
what happened to Ben's brother Kevin.
Then I'm going to find Ben...
...and do the same thing to him.
We broke into the safe
that we thought the statue was in...
...but it's not there.
It's in another one and Ben's
gonna bring it to you right now.
You expect me to believe that?
It's true, I swear to God.
I don't know anything else.
I don't believe you.
Something's going on around here
and you know what it is.
There isn't.
Nothing's going on, I swear.
OK.
I'll tell you.
Just let me up.
I can't breathe. Will you let me up?
Ever had your fortune told, asshole?
Time to go?
Yeah, it's time.
You don't have the balls.
For Kevin I do.
Oh, shit.
Left.
Freeze! FBI! Up against the wall,
cocksucker!
Fortune fish.
Oh, shut up!
Wait.
Not yet.
I want Benjamin to see this.
Jin Sun, that little bitch.
I knew something was up. Come on.
What the fuck?
Up against it!
All right, you're under arrest,
you piece of shit.
This is fucked up.
There's something he didn't tell you.
There's more than one vault open.
- I know.
- It's all fucked up, man.
- He's taking us for a ride.
- Will you shut up and let me think?
What the fuck is going on here?
- You tell me, prick.
- You barbarian shitbag.
You think you can just shoot my guy,
steal my property...
...and get away with it?
- Who the fuck do you think you are?
You talk big for someone who's
operating in my back yard, asshole!
- You put your fucking gun down.
- You put your fucking gun down.
You put your fucking gun up!
- Right now!
- Who the fuck do you think you are?
I'm not gonna fucking repeat myself!
Put your fucking gun down,
you fucking fairy!
Let's go!
- Come on! Come on!
- Drop your fucking gun!
What the fuck is going on, Gregory?
Where the hell is that coming from?
It's down there.
Come on, let's go, guys!
Come on! Come on, Rikki!
Ben!
Listen, you pig!
First of all, don't ever walk out
on me like that ever again.
Second of all...
Who the fuck are you?
OK. First...
...l'd like you to tell us
what the hell this piece of crap is.
- Revenge.
- Huh?
Chu-Jung, the Chinese god
of fire and revenge.
OK, uh, Gregory,
thanks for the mythology lesson...
...but that really only explains
one safe...
...and we got a couple
of empty safes here.
Where is the money
that was in that fucking safe?
What money?
Hey, where did we get all this money?
From Gregory's personal vault.
Oh, that's what you were stealing
from the second safe.
What second safe?
Wait. Rikki didn't know
about the money safe?
Sorry I had to keep it from you. I
figured you had enough on your mind.
Besides, if Gregory wanted to know
what I was doing...
...I figured he'd find out from you.
Sometimes it's better not to know.
That's all right.
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
Why did you fuck Gregory like that,
though, Ben?
Because he killed Kevin.
I thought you didn't know
who killed him.
So did Gregory.
Big mistake.
What did you do
with the fucking cash?
Cash? Me? What are you talking about,
you stupid crazy fuck?
- Two million dollars...
- Kiss my ass!
Look!
I don't know what the fuck's
going on here...
...but I do know that you two guys
are in a bank vault...
...there's a hole in the wall,
safes are blown, shit's missing.
You gotta trust me on this one, guys.
You're gonna go down.
Now get 'em outta here.
Wanna hear something great?
That was Gregory's laundered money
we took from the safe...
...kept there under an alias.
The fucker got arrested
for stealing from himself.
Couldn't do anything about it.
The feds had been trying to nail him
for a long time...
...and this is just what
they were waiting for.
20 years in Leavenworth,
sucking dick for cigarettes.
And Jin Sun? He was just in
the wrong place at the wrong time...
...and the feds tagged him too.
Gregory still blames him
for everything.
Jin Sun would've walked away clean
if he hadn't tried to fuck me.
The night turned out to be
a pretty good night after all.
One of those memories
that's better after the fact...
...than when it's actually happening.
I mean, I got the money,
I got revenge...
...and nobody got killed.
Hell, Rikki even got laid.
As a matter of fact, I got everything
I wanted. Even the girl.
OK, maybe not the girl.
But everything else.
