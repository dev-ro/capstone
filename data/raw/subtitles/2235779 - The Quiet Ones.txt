BEYOND SILENCE
Inspired by true events
LATIMER COLLEGE, OXFORD CONSENT FORM
FOR EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT
University of Oxford 1974
What is the supernatural?
- Anyone? - How do ghosts?
Is the spirits? Is the demons?
- Those are examples. - Actions or events ...
... We can not explain with science.
Right.
Before pathogenic theories were discovered ...
In Medicine ..., people thought that diseases ...
... Were caused by evil spirits.
Raise your hand when you get sick ...
Prefer, ... see a priest, that a Doctor.
Who here believes in God?
Is Paradise? Is Hell?
The apocalypse? Do ghosts?
Really?, Nobody believes in ghosts, it's interesting.
Q David, one of my first patients.
It was a perfectly normal 12 year old boy.
One day, all that changed.
Who do you draw David?
- You know. - Tell me again.
Towards the camera.
Al Sr. Gregor.
The man who makes things happen.
And if they could prove that the supernatural ...
No ... it was a manifestation of what existed in the mind.
- In the subconscious. - What you are doing ...
- ... Is immoral. - Traitor.
That's disgusting how dare you?
- It's not disgusting. - Take it ... not personal.
Do not take it personally.
The honor of the scientists is to prove themselves.
So where do you begin? With the individual.
Yes cures "a" patient, cures all mankind.
- You have no idea, it ... - You can not have an opinion.
- You can not have an opinion. - Can you hold this?
And this?
You're welcome to come back in any occasion ...
This is what we do, see you back in the house.
Not much budget
everyone works for silence.
Your job is to document each step of the experiment.
Hope you do not scare easily.
Do you speak?
- Of course. - Oh, tell me about yourself Brian.
Not much to say.
I like the camera, it is my nature, I guess.
Does being curious?
Filming.
What is your passion?
- Passion? - Yes
What stories are you looking with that camera of yours?
What we have, everything.
Are you a believer?
My mother is ... Religious.
My father is a banker.
My father works in the city, my mother stays at home.
I wonder ...
You are evading my question about talking about yourself, or ...
You are genuinely confused.
I guess not ...
I do not know what I think yet.
Okay so, good Brian ...
Welcome to ... experiment.
You are our "official historian".
Working with the DAV.
El Audio Visual Department.
But you're an intern?
No, he had never entered here.
And how did you get involved with the experiment?
I offered voluntary
as subject.
El Profesor Coupland, Joseph,
I thought it was all wrong.
Without enough torture, apparently.
He already had someone really psychotic.
I see someone.
Well Jane, who do you see?
Do you recognize this person?
I do not know, I'm not sure.
The girl is a little girl.
There!
Maybe a doll.
- Something is wrong. - Okay.
You are perfectly safe.
His name is Evey, I do not like.
The name of the doll is Evey?
Solo I need sleep.
Silence! Calm down!
It's just a pipe, a pipe only ...
Fun crazy right?
Shall we go up?
DREAM TEMPERATURE
It's for your own protection.
And ours.
- What's wrong with her? - It's suicidal,
no memory of the past.
Children of aging, abandoned.
Moving from place to place.
Families stayed with her for a while, then ...
You know ...
... Things began to happen.
Moving furniture,
objects on fire.
He was convinced that was poseída.
Luckily, Joseph discovered.
Le diagnosis schizophrenia, as is usual ...
Then measured their brain waves.
Frequencies outside the chart, look.
That is why the choice.
And out of the asylum.
Well, Brian, welcome to experiment.
Do not look into his eyes,
do not say anything to her, if I can help it.
I can not allow the experiment is corrupt ...
... By outside influences.
I understand.
What?
Do you think my head will start to spin?
I'm so sorry.
Sí, te interrumpí.
- It comes and goes. - Excuse me?
What's inside ...
Stop staring at my wrist.
- Sorry. - I promised Joseph ...
No ... that would try again.
That would give him time.
Is now the time?
Yes, if course.
Can you cure me?
I'm sure you can.
I just want to improve.
Tell Joseph I'm ready.
Pídele I duerman.
I beg you.
Brian.
Thank you.
¿Seen a ghost?
- She, she knew my name. - We probably heard ...
Hablando ... you sometime.
She's not stupid.
She told me to tell ...
You need sleep ... and she's ready.
Excellent.
That's a good sign.
I really do not know if I can do this, sir.
If you think you're scared, imagine how she feels.
Furthermore,
¿On you a little puzzled?
Hey you, you there!
Are you there? Is he there in that house?
I'm about to go crazy, if not for the sound ...
What is the point exactly?
Remember: "If you heal a patient will heal humanity."
Jane Harper is the patient.
If we can induce our subject, I expressed negative energy,
in the form of telekinetic activity
we cultivate that energy and remove it.
How to extract a tumor.
Cure mental illness for life.
- Are you skeptical, Brian? - Excuse me?
¿In think we can cure Harper?
We can not have non-believers in this house, Brian.
It is a destructive energy,
in a constructive space.
Oh, not again.
Harry, can you take up music?
Thanks for stopping by ... but ...... I'm sorry, I'll be more careful ...
- Very well, thank you. - Thank you.
Solo aplaude.
Hola Jane, this trajimos algorithm.
You can put all your bad thoughts ...
And negative energy ... on the wrist, Jane.
And get rid of them,
Get rid of them ... forever.
Evey is not so,
is all wrong.
Why do not you describe me?
This doll is dead.
Inside.
It's the only thing my parents said, my eyes.
They were my real parents.
No family with which I was placed.
They were so nice, but I knew ...
Soon ... ...
Also ... they hate me.
It must have been very painful for you.
The scared at all.
You're not possessed, Jane, you're just not good.
I just want to sleep.
Forever.
You are worried that Jane Harper remove their own lives ...
That's why we keep so under surveillance, and medicated.
So why? Why work in this ...
- ...experimento, Harry?
- ¿Yo?
Scientific achievements??
The equipment we use is as an engineer's dream.
Jesus!
¡Ayúdenme!
95 to 70.
So how did you get into this?
Initially my field was, Abnormal Psychology, which ...
Scary ... despite the title,
it simply means the study of behavior, unusual.
I went through all kinds of dubious quacks, and mathematicians crazy
desmentí and all, and then ...
David appeared Q.
LIGHTS.
Where is Mr. Gregor?
I think David used the character of Mr. Gregor ...
Telekinetic ... to explain that his mind was habit.
In the same way that Jane is dependent evey mentally.
Exactly.
Why Mr. Gregor these things makes you David?
I do not know.
My mom says that he is evil.
- What about you do you think? - He is bad.
- And me too. - Mr. Gregor is invented.
Your mind and you are creating you can undo it.
I can help you.
Out! Out! Out! Out!
Out!
¡David!
Mr. Gregor is a character from a bedtime story ...
... David's father used to read.
His parents must have felt guilty.
What happened to David Q, sir?
He was getting better with my help, but his mother,
a religious woman, ended the session,
lost touch.
I heard he is living a relatively normal life, somewhere.
Hola Joseph.
Knights.
Why do I have the impression that this is about ...
To get nasty ...?
We have to move to Jane.
- What? - Why?
They cut the funding of the experiment.
Fucking cowards!
They're already dead anyway.
Krissi, Harry...
Or ... let the experiment continue with it,
whatever it is, I understand.
You know what?
We are with you Joseph.
Until the end.
Cameraman, I have not much,
not much left to film.
Use tape more cheaply.
After all,
I'm starting to get a little intrigued.
It's the best ...
Come on, empaquemos.
Do you like?
If you make me better.
It's time to go.
If one of us all.
Very well.
Shall we? Yes, I have.
Just be careful.
Search for EMF.
There is one at each corner and one in the table,
A total of 5.
Basically have the smallest change in the fields ...
Electromagnetic ....
I borrowed Engineering Department.
So if we can connect the mental activity of Harper,
which is recorded in the EG machine.
A telekinetic events, then ...
So if Evey is made of negative energy, then ...
... This would help us identify it.
- Exactly. - All right, Brian!
- Very good. We're ready. - Yes
Here we go.
I just want to ask some questions Evey.
Let Evey.
Sal.
Come play with us.
1 hit for "yes" and 2 for "no".
Ven Evey, por favor.
She does not want to talk?
Damn Jane!
Lo intento Joseph.
Try harder.
Lord, how do you assess our progress?
How did you assess our progress?
Patients and courage ...
Evey has slowly come to life,
if we survive, we won the Nobel Prize.
Wait ...
Is there a possibility that there?
What did not?
- Survive. - There is always a possibility.
Security is a superstition.
Not exist in nature,
and less in the adventure field.
¿Einstein?
Adam Keller.
Just put it in the bottom corner, right?
To brighten things up.
Thank you.
Do you feel good?
I'm a disappointment.
I'm taking too long.
I have to find Evey.
Gently
descends into darkness.
Shows the total relaxation of your feelings.
Through any mental chaos.
Deeper.
List.
Deeper.
She is in the middle state.
How do you feel?
Lost.
Alone.
But you're not alone right?
It comes from the darkness.
There is something there for you right?
What is it?
Say: "I am not alone."
- I'm alone. - Say it!
I'm a failure.
Everyone hates me.
I want to die.
Damn Jane, if you will not try, check again ...
... To chemical treatment.
- Jesus Christ! - What was that?
I measured it, does one or two?
I have the camera in hand, and I have to shoot a lot.
How are we doing? It happened ...
Evey was here.
Why do not you tell us?
She was playing.
Bring her back.
Jane, bring her back.
We have made progress tonight
- un brindis Brian, tú hazlo.
- Yo no...
- Do it now, do not think. - Come on.
- But Jane. - But Jane.
- I think he's falling in love. - Oh God!
You can bring flowers to us next time.
Electromagnetic Explosion
Harry.
Brian, Jane is asleep. Mantenla vigilada.
- I love you. - Now why ...
... You had to ruin the mood with that filthy word, very filthy.
Brian Goodnight.
Good night.
The bed broke.
- Sorry about that. - I do not.
Brian Goodnight.
Lights tired, why do not you lie down?
I take over.
Harry.
I can not see her.
Can you see it?
Krissi. ¡Krissi!
I need, I need ...
I need the lights.
- So right? - Yes, yes, perfect.
Now you feel better right?
Déjame Verla Jane.
She is pretty.
So why do you do this to her?
Evey? Losing hair?
Are you sick?
Is someone you hate?
Did he hurt you when you were little?
Jane, please try to remember.
Hey, stop, stop.
You must let us help you, okay?
Help me? God.
They will not help me.
Si soy invisible.
¿No me see disappear?
Security. Weak pulse.
Brian, Mira esto.
- See that? - What, what's that?
It seems to have been scraping something.
¡Jane! ¡Jane! ¡Jane! ¡Jane!
¡Jane! ¡Jane!
Let's get out of here. Come on!
- What is it? - It's not me, is Evey.
- What? - It's inside me now.
Tómame.
- Jane. - She's inside me.
Do you feel it? You can even touch it.
Para.
Déjalo ir.
Get your hands off your pants, now, please.
Thank you.
Sorry, I did not ...
- ... It looked. - I know.
Yo, yo ...
- ... I do not understand what happens. - It's obvious.
She is aware of your feelings for her.
What could be very dangerous.
- For you. - Coward.
Best you go.
Yes!
Coward!
It is work,
You can stop at any time.
She's not your responsibility.
We will.
She's here.
He EMF is between 1 ... 2 ... 5
Let us talk to Evey.
Can you do it? Touch 1 for "yes" ...
2 to ... "in".
EMF marked 5.
- Both heat. - It's right there, guys.
- There's a fire. - No, no, no fire.
You are perfectly safe.
Krissi Could you pass me the candle?
Evey? Afraid of the fire?
¿Joseph?
To! To!
Did not I tell you to stay away?
We lost.
Do that again and you're out!
Hello.
It is open.
Jane.
¿Jane?
Jane, Jane.
What's that?
Where did you get it?
¡Krissi!
¡Harry, Krissi!
I do not know
has lost 1 kilo and a half, he is painting his body with blood.
It is crippling, sorry.
Ella should see a Doctor.
- Are you going to do that? - Do what?
Retire, may the verge of something significant?
I do not know, I have not thought so.
There is so much you can achieve.
Evey and I could be friends.
I think I was always naked girl.
Without the clothes always.
Do I look like a woman to you?
Every time I look in the mirror, I see that girl.
I see a woman.
Are you shy?
In going to touch me.
- Let me out of here. - And go where?
What a quiet place?
- With more doctors? - There must be something more ...
... We can do for you, other than this.
- This? - The "experiment".
You know I can not leave.
- Why not? - Joseph bother ...
You should not worry about it.
He rescued me, he saved me.
Of myself,
of your type.
Cameramen??
Men, stupid and vile men frustrated ...
No ... that touch people, or want,
atormentarte sin,
in your body and heart and your feelings.
And I turned on a fire burning.
Joseph?, Is that kind of man?
What are you?
Duplicate.
Ponla to the banks.
- Here is Jane. - No.
Are you sure?
Krissi, Harry, Harry ...
Brian.
- Would you like ... - Yes
Just ... Okay.
You said there was a fire.
There are llamas ...
... Everywhere.
The roof, walls ...
There is so much heat.
So hot ...
Both heat.
¡Evey!
Evey has returned.
What do you see Jane? Dinos.
We can not leave.
We are locked.
Who? Who are locked?
Burning.
Burning.
Stuff
Stuff Stuff Stuff A Evey!
- Hielo ¡Krissi hielo! - Dios, Jesucristo.
She needs to see a Doctor.
No, no, no, no doctors.
- No, no doctors. - Krissi ... She needs it.
- No Doctors. - Here is the ice.
- Jane. - ¡Oh Dios mio!
Did you record it?
I think I got it, whatever it is.
- What do we think it was? - A fucking shitty exorcism.
It's what you always say,
expressed her negative energy.
- Eso scares me. - You're scared,
because you can not explain what you saw.
Then your mind back to the stories ...
You ... it scared the nest.
Evil spirits and such.
And how do you explain it?
I call it "teleplasm".
That was teleplasm?
Damn!
The next step is the transfer.
Once Jane's psychic energy,
you have found a new home.
We isolated and we get rid of him forever.
Now?
The doors of the psyche are open,
and we will cross the.
She is hurt, tired,
she needs rest and food.
Even God rested on the seventh day.
Interesting.
- Krissi. - Bueno, obviously,
I want to continue, Joseph, but ...
maybe she needs a break.
- ¿Harry?
- Sí.
Then it's unanimous.
Demos to our subject, a great and well deserved rest.
Come play.
- You have to finish first. - Are you ready?
- That was pathetic. - Silly, really.
Cut this, cut that.
We need to talk with Evey,
she can come and stay right here.
Right here, in this doll.
It may be her, for him to stay there ...
All the time ... your choice.
I can not find her.
Where are you hiding tonight, Evey?
She is not hidden, it is lost.
Eso on sleep lost.
Are you going down to talk to us? We want to know.
¡Oh Dios!
Stay down!
Joseph.
Tell Jane to come, we just want to talk.
Tell him to come and play with us.
To play clean.
She's here.
You've grown up, little girl.
If you're old enough to walk.
If you are great for walking, so are you to talk.
Talk to us!
Solo Solo ... want to be friends.
- She knows lying. - What can we do to get off?
- Where was it? - I do not know.
¡Evey!
Come on, come on.
Aim there.
If we can be friends, you have to leave calm to Jane.
Jane Dile.
- Vete Evey, for favor. - ¡Dili in the series!
¡Vete Evey!
- Krissi ¿Where are you? - Are you trying to show us something.
Me mordió...
Evey se fue, se fue.
Are you okay?
Me mordió...
Stuff Stuff Stuff A Evey!
- ... Need a Doctor. - No, no, no, no doctors.
What will happen to Jane, now that Evey refuses to leave?
Maybe we burn the host.
Maybe that is what Harper has been talking about.
Matar a Evey.
And that would not be a good ending?
Very dramatic.
Sorry?
Are you implying that we are making this up?
What this is a setup?
"Professor suggestible Local hires a cameraman ...
... To become famous. "
Do not be absurd. What burns ...
De Jane ...?
Acid Doll, basic chemistry!
If I went to school.
And what about electromagnetic readings?
- Keystrokes? - It's easy to fake.
- And the bite? - Auto inflicted, if not watched.
And shock ...
Evey?? Evey?'re There?
If you break something under the table ...
The leg supports the metal.
And a telekinetic event.
So what you're saying is that Joseph is a fraud.
And what Harry and I are fools? How about some idiots?
No, what I mean is that this does not happen by scientific evidence.
And in the process, we are torturing a human being.
No other reason than morbid desire to please him.
What are you doing?
- Yes, wrist, saw the smoke. - Yes!
I say it's false.
Look ... If you bury something here ...
- ¡Oh Dios mio! - Jane.
- Jane. - Jane ¡Oh Dios!
No!
Are you faking it too?
I understand this has been difficult.
It is human nature to ask questions.
And be skeptical.
Sorry ...
- ... Intended to cause the ... - depends on you, Brian ...
We need ... Every detail.
I'm fine now.
Here you go.
All right.
She will need your strength for what is do.
What is it?
Aislar a Evey.
And delete it.
Almost, wait a second.
Please try to move on.
Look at the center.
Find Evey.
1... 2... 3...
Pictures ... Soviet Technology.
Capture bioelectromagnetic energy within a living organism.
- Your aura? - The field of bioelectric energy ...
This is Jane in a neutral state of mind.
And this is when it started to manifest ...
Evey.
It is spooky.
So this proves ...
That technology can be used to prove that there cameraman.
It's the best we can do.
Look what you've done Jane.
You created it, you can get rid of it.
Do not want to get rid of it.
You can not be serious!
You can not ...
Joseph.
All right.
He cares about us.
It does.
Joseph, I have fear.
- It means you're alive. - You'll be safe elsewhere.
With another family.
And I'll be healthy.
In like feel scared.
Usually I scare people.
I want to make you feel good.
No this Noche, Krissi.
I must conserve energy ...
Go back to bed.
We will.
What is it?
- Nothing. - Has been away ...
- ... All week, something happens. - Only I feel ...
... As we live in a spaceship.
No TV, phones do not work.
I stopped going to classes, I have not even read the newspaper.
It is a prison.
It is a prison and we are their prisoners.
This has gone far away.
- What do you mean, us? - No, you idiot!
El "experiment".
You two are blind?
Joseph is in love with Jane Harper.
He wants to kill us, to stay with her.
- Do not be a girl. - Fuck you!
Krissis.
I had nothing to do with this, I swear.
- I was asleep. - You could have been sleeping,
- That's impossible. - She heard you laugh.
- No controlo a Evey.
- Tu creaste a Evey.
This is the time where your big assumption ...
... Joseph meets reality.
What's the fucking plan?
Do you even have one?
The plan is the same as it has always been ...
Curar a Jane Harper.
She tried to kill me.
- Your little tried to kill me. - Jesus! Joseph ...
Te leaves them of the, ¿es eso part ...
Experiment ...?
You can go to Hell. Everyone.
Harry, go help.
So why could not have been sleeping?
Because that means you can ...
Manifest ... when she is unconscious.
Y. ..
That's ... Well ...
Unexpected.
Sorry Harry.
All are in love with her, you know?
- Tú, Joseph y Brian, sobretodo Brian. - Vamos, Krissi, in series.
Everyone thinks they can save.
It was current, let's check the fuse box.
What?
- Brian! Brian! - What?
Bring the light, Jane is lost.
- Sir? - Come on.
Where is he? Where was it?
If I knew the answer to that would not be lost right?
¡Ayúdenme!
- Jane.
- ¡Jane!
Jane, where are you?
¡Jane!
¡Jane!
Open the door!
Be careful.
Slowly.
Do not know what's here.
Sorry sir.
Jane.
Jane. Are you hurt?
Damn!
- I can not see. - Jane!
Jane...
Jane...
¿Jane?
- Where is he? - Jane.
- What is that toy? - What?
- What's this? What's this? - It's like painting.
In the wall Bathroom Jane.
- Are you okay? - Damn.
It's totally dark here, sorry.
- ¡Jane!
- ¡Oh Dios!
- God, what is this? - Jane?
¡Jane!
Oh God! Not here, can we get out of here?
God.
- Oh Jesús! - ¡Maldición Krissi!
- We have to stick together. - Do not scare us like that!
- Sorry. - Oh God!
- Jane, please. - ¡Jane!
We understand that this has been difficult,
But now we are your family!
- What was that? - Oh God!
What do they do?
Why are the lights off?
Where is Evey?
What was that? What was that?
- Wine there. - What is it?
Lord! Lord! Lord!
She's right in front of you.
What about honey?
- Do you bother? - Acércala.
- Zooms. - Want to get out of this house?
I get it.
Would you charge?
I'm here, do not be afraid.
Shut it down! Jane! Jane!
- What is that? - What is it?
What was that?
- It's a stamp. - What?
A stamp.
A symbol of demonic worship.
It is something that one of you idiots put in your mind.
Can you at least appear please consider the possibility ...
What Jane did not create Evey?
Good. That maybe ... Evey wine ...
Another place?
What came from somewhere else, is the idea ...
Damn ... what hidden.
To a patient who is highly suggestible.
So I ask you again ...
Which one of you did it?
What if he did not come from any of us?
What if she is just a container? A conduit?
- She needs to go to a hospital. - Try to control your hysteria ...
Kristina ... is beneath you ...
She is just expressing ...
- ... What you feel. - Nobody asked you Harry!
We do not talk as if you were children.
- We are colleagues. - So think before you speak,
colleague. With each event we learn more about the paranormal ...
Eradicate ... like me.
We are scientists! No schoolgirls.
- That is so incredibly sexist. - It may not fit ...
- ... Exactly in our hypothesis. - Not if she is possessed!
It can not be.
It was made right Joseph?
Evil Under ...
Believe that with all your heart, right?
Can we stop the experiment if you want, now.
No.
I do not want to hear another talk nonsense superstition ...
In this house ... again.
If one of you is very scared ...
You can go now.
If I'm really scared.
We should return to Oxford.
Can we save what is left of the semester.
What about Jane?
- Sorry. - We gave him a break.
Now we need one.
Did you seen this stamp before?
What do mean something to you?
- I do not remember. - Try Jane, is important.
Before coming, I was never comfortable with who he was.
Not sure what is to be.
Have you ever heard someone say your name ...
Without recognizing that ... is yours?
Or look at old pictures of you without recognizing your face?
Me he felt well, since tengo memory.
Do not lose your faith in Joseph.
Or Evey, or me.
We need you.
For the first time,
I think there is finally a way to be happy.
- Evey is making it possible. - We can not ...
Why not?
Yet.
- Brian. - Not until you are well.
Do you think it will ever Evey alone Jane Harper?
- Whatever it is Evey. - Fuck Evey!
Harper, Jane
Jane.
Jane.
I have to leave,
I will when I can, okay?
- Do you understand? - If you understand what?
Tengo go al laboratory film.
To get more tape.
It might take a while.
Wow, okay.
Take your time.
You?
Are you the type of the camera, working for Joseph Coupland?
Escúchate, nothing to say.
Just like everyone in the inner circle of Joseph.
Tell me you've been indoctrinated into silence?
They must have already killed.
Knew that killing a Mistress is a perfect way ...
Create ... a ghost.
Heinrich Dwyer and some members of the Lilitu.
The Lilitu doing a ritual performed by Evey Dwyer.
Oh mierda.
Oh, ¡vamos!
¡Harry!
¡Harry!
She needs to be locked up.
In the asylum, sedated. Right?
When you leave a house haunted by a spirit ...
Not supposed to follow you.
- Harry is rational. - Rational?
- Now Evey ... - Cameraman!
Why you so long?
They call themselves the Lilitu.
A cult that worshiped an ancient demon, worshiped by the Sumerians.
5000 years before Christianity.
Is that a joke?
- Krissi almost lost his life. - It's not a joke, it's Evey!
- ¿Evey?
- Evey Dwyer.
Since she showed a gift for clairvoyance.
The leader, Doctor ...
Dr. Heinrich Dwyer, was convinced that Evey ...
Could reincarnate ... their idol.
On July 6, 1954 ...
Dr. Dwyer ... Evey says a message received ...
Lilitu ... that should be enclosed in this building ...
A massive fire destroyed the building that night.
Killing everyone inside.
Lord.
Lord.
Everyone, including Evey Dwyer.
Who was born with a birthmark.
A stamp.
Evey Dwyer is somehow
a force that has to Jane Harper.
Oh my God!
Evey is going to do to us, what he did to the Lilitu.
- She's ... - A demonic spirit.
Evil is evil, right from wrong.
Until the end of time right?
Maybe a little ...
Self indulgent.
This seriously can not serve them.
- Sirvió all. - Is the?
Or what?
The rational explanation.
