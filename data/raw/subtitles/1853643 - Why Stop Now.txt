You remember the grade
you couldn't get?
Coach bumped that up a bit for you.
You passed the course, didn't you?
- Yeah.
- Your "dusanikbats" uncle.
You had to get out of his house.
Within one week, a truck came and
moved you and your kid sister out.
I ever bring that up?
Never a word out of me.
Always there for you.
Am I lying? Come on, kid.
Come on, please, will you?
I'm not asking you to commit a homicide
here. I'm asking you to just give me...
a little bit of information.
I need something-- anything.
I ain't got nothing
to say, Coach.
When I was a kid, my mother used to
go, "Arthur, you're a capo tost."
- You know what a "capo tost" is?
- Naw.
It means you got a head
like concrete.
I think me and you, we suffer from
the same affliction. I swear to God.
Kid, on the court, you're the most
coachable kid I ever had.
I never had a boy
that could respond like you.
Off the court,
I can't tell you a damn thing.
This is your money.
Hey, this is yours.
- I don't need that money, Coach.
- Tell me something.
I got Calculus.
You forgot something.
Yeah.
Mm, right there.
Oh, yeah.
- Mr. Shuttlesworth, how are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?
- Dom Pagnotti. Pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello, Lala.
- Hello.
- D'Andre, what's up?
- How you doing?
- Why don't we go inside?
I'll show you my house.
- We'd love to.
- Wow. This a phat crib.
- Ain't it?
- What do you think?
- You have a really nice home.
Thank you. I just did it.
Built it from scratch.
- It's gorgeous.
- Thank you.
Why don't you and Lala make
yourself at home and let me
and Jesus discuss some business.
This right here
is a 355 Ferrari Spider, $130,000.
You're looking at
a 12-cylinder Mercedes, 600 SL--
$135,000.
Now, if you want the best,
Jesus, you come right this way.
A quarter-million-dollar
Lamborghini Diablo.
- Take a look inside, Jesus.
- You can get a house
with a quarter million dollars.
Not the house
I'm going to get you.
- You like music?
- I love music.
- Has a $30,000 stereo system.
State of the art.
- $30,000?
30,000. That's a small trailer home
in North Carolina...
you got playing music
for you right there.
Now, Jesus,
I know you like Lala.
Whatever may be may be.
But you can look like Buddy Hackett...
and drive down a street with this
and have 40 girls chasing you.
I want to show you my court.
Oh, so you just got the court
built inside the house, huh?
- Of course.
- Let's go one-on-one.
- Let's see what you got.
- What I got?
- Let's see what you got.
- I got--
So you in the Mafia.
Down with Gotti, huh?
Mafia? Gotti?
Just because I'm an ltalian American
doesn't mean I'm involved with the mob.
I'm the best at what I do.
I'm a sports agent.
Now, I don't know
if you realize this,
but several NBA teams
are interested in you right now.
At this point in time,
I can't tell you who,
but I will tell you
they are contenders.
Now, I know you've considered
jumping straight to the pros.
The money is there.
I have the contacts.
So apply for the NBA draft now.
Right here, Jesus,
is a contract.
This makes me your agent.
This allows me
to represent you.
I will take you to the top.
I can't do that right now.
I have to weigh my options.
- How much does your watch cost?
- 89.95.
89.95. Right here...
is a platinum
and diamond Rolex.
The best you can buy.
Gold? Forget about it.
Silver? Forget about it.
You have platinum and diamonds. That's
like having speed and power in the NBA.
And, Jesus, that watch is a gift
from Dom Pagnotti to you.
- Keep it.
- Oh, I bet there's strings
attached, too, huh?
There's no strings, no rubber bands.
There's nothing attached at all.
That's a $36,000 watch. That's like
having a Corvette on your wrist.
- You keep that.
- I can't take this.
- Why not?
- It's illegal. I can't take it.
I don't see anyone here.
Just me and you.
- There's nobody here,
but it's still illegal.
- You know what, Jesus?
I'll keep it. The money
you and I gonna make together,
you could buy 20 of them
if you want.
Yeah, that's all good
and everything, but when I'm ready,
- I'm thinking about hiring
a brother to represent me.
- Yeah? Why's that?
I just feel comfortable
with a brother.
All right, Jesus,
let me ask you a question.
- What color is this?
- It's green.
You're black, I'm white,
this is green.
When making a business decision,
the only color that matters is green.
Now, do you consider yourself
a man or a boy?
- Of course I consider myself a man.
- Okay.
Because men make decisions
with their mind.
Boys make decisions
with their heart, Jesus.
- My partner D'Andre, he's black.
- No!
So it really doesn't matter.
You have the best
of both worlds.
You need to sign with me,
and you need to sign with me now.
-You talk a great game.
-Jesus, this isn't a game. This is life.
I can bring you
to the Promised Land,
but what you need to do, Jesus,
is give me the opportunity...
to show you how good I am.
Dear Jesus,
your daddy and I hope you're fine.
"l thought it might be
a little hard for you...
"being away from home for--
for the first time.
I had no idea that--"
I didn't even know
they had basketball camps.
Thank God I got you out of Coney lsland
for at least a week this summer.
"You're really serious
about this basketball,
and that's good."
However, I do wonder sometimes...
whether it's you or your father
that wants to pursue this.
I know he drives you
too hard.
That's right. Come on,
come on. Work, baby.
You got to work harder
than the next man, right?
It's the will of the man;
it ain't the skill of the man.
He can't play you.
He can't do nothing with you!
We the only two people up. Me, you and
Michael Jordan. That's the only people.
Everybody else in the world is asleep.
What you think Jordan doing right now?
He lifting weights right now.
We out the projects, baby.
We out the projects.
Where we gonna live at, son? Where
we living at, yo? Where we living at?
Huh? We living on East Side.
Where we at?
We're up on the Upper West Side?
Central Park West somewhere?
- Where we gonna be at, huh?
What you gonna buy Mama, son?
- House.
Come on.
A big house, right?
How many bedrooms?
How many bedrooms?
- How many she want?
- As many as she wants.
Don't never let them see you weak.
Let me tell you something.
- Don't never let them see you weak.
- This is for everything.
You miss, you know
you givin' me ten pushups, right?
You know if you miss, you
give me ten pushups, right?
- All right, show me what you got.
Concentrate.
Four... three... two--
That's what I'm talking about. That's
what I'm talking about. Are you tired?
Jesus Shuttlesworth, he got game.
He don't get tired.
- Are you tired? You tired?
- Uh-huh.
"But, son, your father
does love you dearly."
- You should have seen your boy today.
- What did he do?
- What'd you get them for, son?
- About 34 points.
- Thirty-four.
- Thirty-four points?
You got 34, but one time
he went up, I was like, "Oh, my boy."
- I thought he was gonna dunk.
He just kept going.
- Really?
He kept going. He's almost getting the
rim now, or the net, anyway-- the net.
- That's my baby.
- That's right. My boy.
"Have fun at the camp,
and remember--"
Use basketball as a tool.
"Love, Mommy."
"P.S.-- Your sister
misses you badly."
And when you get home,
please be nice to her.
Big brothers have to protect
their little sisters.
Come on, baby.
- Don't hold back, baby.
- Oh, oh, yeah, oh.
No, baby, come on. Don't hold back.
Come on, baby.
Oh, yeah, baby.
Fuck me now.
Fuck me. Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Come on, baby.
Come on, baby, come on.
Fuck me, baby.
Where them elbows at?
Give me the elbows. Make me pay for it.
Make me pay if I get too close.
Make me pay!
Yes. All right,
good shoot! Oh!
- All right.
- All right, that's two.
- Two-zip.
- Two-zip.
I'll give you ten.
He's cheating, Jesus.
Come on now. Play ball.
Just 'cause a man bigger than you,
don't mean he better than you.
Whoo-hoo!
Play some "D" now.
Get up on him, Jesus.
Money.
What's that, baby?
- Ask Goose.
- What was that, ten-one?
- Ten-two? Butter.
- Luck.
You ain't ready for me.
Come on, Jesus.
Get up on him, Jesus.
- Check it out.
- Check 'em.
- Don't push me.
- So what I push you? So what?
You're gonna get mad
when you get pushed?
What, you wanna quit
when you get pushed?
- Oh!
- Take your shot.
I could take you out
your game that easy, huh?
So somebody gets up on you.
So what?
- Stop pushing him, man.
- You got to deal with that, son.
You mad? That's all the players got
to do to you, is make you mad, huh?
All they gotta do is make you mad
and you'll give up, won't you?
'Cause when you get mad,
you can't play.
'Cause when you get mad,
you can't make a shot.
Come get it now.
I ain't taking it easy on you.
I told you I ain't taking it easy
on you. Where you at, boy?
J-J, come on,
give the guy a break, man.
Come on,
go strong, Jesus.
- Why you cheating, man?
- How did I cheat?
- Don't tell me how to raise my son.
- Stop pushing me.
So I'm pushing you. So what?
Show me what you got.
Stop pushing me.
- Take it! Take it!
- Go strong, baby.
- Like nobody's better than you!
- I'm supposed to be scared?
Yes. That's what
I'm talking about.
No matter what I say to you, I ain't
got nothing to do with your game.
It's between you
and the rim.
Don't be afraid of nobody.
That's right.
Elbow me if--
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Go strong.
- Get out of here.
Go get it, the ball.
Go get it.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Get up.
- Foul, man!
- All right, you got foul. No harm.
Respect my call. Besides, that wasn't
a foul. That was attempted murder!
What you mean, respect your call?
Ain't nobody even hardly touch you.
- What you trying to prove?
- Just get up, boy, and stop
crying. Give me the ball.
- Give me the ball, man.
- What you doing?
- Check it out--
- Hey, respect my call.
- Besides, that wasn't a foul--
- Don't start yelling at me, boy.
No harm. No foul.
Are you hurt? You bleeding?
What you think? I want to see
you get pushed like that. Ow!
- You gonna cry now or something?
- Why you got to push-- Whoa!
- Take the ball out. Huh?
- Man, I quit, man.
- Man, I quit!
- You quit?
- What?
- I quit. I'm out of here.
Oh, you out of here now. You're
gonna quit like a little bitch, huh?
Big bitch!
You better go
and get my ball!
- I ain't getting a damn thing!
- Jesus!
- Daddy, leave me alone!
- Jake, that's some wrong shit, man.
I'm out of here, man.
Fuck, that's why
he ain't gonna make it.
That's why he
ain't gonna make it.
Damn, I can't believe he threw
that shit over the fence.
What's the matter, baby?
You don't like the food.
The food is fine.
Just not hungry.
- Where's your daddy?
- I don't know, and I don't care.
Uncle Jake must have beat him
in basketball again. Ow!
- Stop hitting on him.
- Tell him to stop then. He
always getting on my nerves.
No, I'm not going
to tell him to shut up,
and these basketball wars between
you and your father have got to stop.
I just asked your son
where you were.
Don't they feed you
at home, Booger?
How you doing, baby?
Your food was getting cold,
so I put it in the oven.
You know, when you threw that ball
over the fence, it got lost.
You know that, right?
Paid my hard-earned money for that
basketball. You know that, don't you?
We can always buy
a new basketball.
Yeah, we don't need
a new ball, okay?
We had a ball already.
Besides, you need to learn how
to respect other people's property.
Ball belonged to me,
not to him.
- Mommy, can I be excused?
- No, you cannot. Sit your ass down.
- I'm finished!
- Yeah, well, you ain't excused though.
- He's done, Jake.
- I ain't done. Sit your black ass down.
And it's time for you to go.
And put the bread back down.
- Trying to sneak bread all the time.
- Bye, Jesus!
I said sit down. I'm your daddy
and you're gonna do what I tell you.
Don't raise your voice.
Do what I tell you to do,
and I'm telling you to sit down.
- So? I'm finished.
- What?
- You hear what I say to you, huh?
- Jake!
- Boy, when I tell you to sit down--
- Get off me!
- When I tell you to sit down--
- Jake, get off him!
- Get up off me!
- Get off him! What's wrong with you?
Are you out of your mind?
Stop it! Please!
Baby?
- Mommy? Mommy?
- Baby?
- Get up. Get up.
- Wake up, baby.
Baby, wake up.
Call 9-1-1, son.
Call 9-1-1. Go ahead.
Call 9-1-1. Go, go.
Come on, let's walk.
I knew you was going to come though.
I appreciate it, though, son.
Yeah, I appreciate you for coming
to meet me and everything like that.
I got this for Mary here. You know,
I thought she might like these here.
My all-time favorite ballplayer
was Earl Monroe.
Earl the Pearl.
Yeah, he was nice. See, everybody
remember him from the Knicks,
you know, when he helped win
that second championship.
I'm talking about when he was with the
Bullets down at Winston-Salem Stadium...
before that game, with 42 points
a game the whole season.
41.6...
the whole season.
But the Knicks, they put the shackles on
him, man, you know, on his whole game.
They locked him up,
like in a straitjacket or something.
When he was in the streets of Philly,
the playgrounds,
he was like--
- You know what they called him?
- What?
Jesus. That's what they called him--
Jesus. 'Cause he was the truth.
Then the white media got a hold of it.
Then they got to call him Black Jesus.
He can't just be Jesus.
He got to be Black Jesus.
You know, but still...
he was the truth.
So that's the real reason
why you got your name.
You named me Jesus after Earl Monroe,
and not Jesus in the Bible?
Not Jesus of the Bible,
Jesus of North Philadelphia.
Jesus of the playgrounds.
That's the truth, son.
The way he dished, the way
he, you know, he spinned.
You know how you do,
coming off and all that. Taw!
I want you to go
to Big State, son.
That's the real reason
why I'm out here.
That's the reason
they let me out.
You find it in your heart to go
to Big State, and, uh...
they may let me out
on an early parole.
-So that's what this is all about, huh?
-That's a part of it.
- Jake, you just like everybody else.
- I ain't like everybody else.
I ain't like everybody else.
Everybody else ain't your father.
Everybody else ain't
bring you in this world.
Everybody else don't care
about you, son.
Like that girl you running with.
You know her, Lay-- Layla?
- Lala!
- Lala. You know her?
- Yeah, I know her.
- Yeah, she know you like a book too.
Many a great man, son,
their downfall was 'cause of a woman.
- You talking about Samson and Delilah.
- Yeah, that's right.
Him too. Him too.
You see I don't cut my hair, right?
So you do know
your Bible, huh?
Look, son, just be careful.
That's all I'm saying to you, all right?
All right?
Do you know if you're
gonna go to Big State?
I mean, is that like a finalist,
or the final four for you?
- They are in my top ten.
- In your top ten?
All right. That's good.
One out of ten, that's--
I can live with them odds.
- What's up, Booger?
- Hi, Uncle Jake.
All right, I'm, uh--
Just give that to Mary.
- What's up, Booger?
- What's up?
She knows it's only a treat.
She doesn't get it all the time.
Just once in a while.
Aww.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Man, thank God it's Friday.
- Friday?
You better thank God
you're here, man.
I'm just glad you was able
to make it, man.
Sorry it was
so last-minute though.
Man, don't be crazy, man.
I know all the schools sweating you.
- How many you visit?
- Four.
You gonna take the extra
ten they gave you?
- You know I don't need no ten visits.
- Yeah, right.
Hi, Chick.
- That was my last one.
- Yeah?
Who was that?
She was sweating you.
You like this?
You like this, don't you?
- Yeah, it's really nice.
- Yeah, I could tell.
This ain't the projects, man. We got
like grass and trees, and fresh air.
This is Morgan.
This is Monty.
- How you doing?
- How you doing, Jesus?
- We'll check you later.
- Later on. Them boys can play, man.
What's up, Chick? Hey, Chick.
Hey, girls, how you doing?
- Hey.
- Oh, man.
Mm!
Goodness. I know the both
of y'all know Jesus Shuttlesworth.
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
That's not right, Chick.
That's not right, Chick.
Hey, how about Sunday?
Take y'all out of church?
- Wait. You're Jesus of Coney lsland?
- Yeah, that's me.
Look, you've got to come
to this school.
With you and Chick, we'll
definitely go to the Final Four.
- Go? We'll win the whole thing.
- That's you, dog.
- You are going to go here, aren't you?
- Well, we hope so.
It's my job to convince him.
And this is his last
visit to any schools.
- Jesus, Tech-U is a really cool place.
You will love it here.
- Really?
- I mean, we really know how to party.
- Oh, you do?
- Uh-oh.
- It's, uh, really cool.
- I hope I see you around.
- All right.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye, Chick.
- Bye, Chick.
Come on. Let's go meet
Coach Billy Sunday, man.
- Forget Billy Sunday.
We need to follow them.
- Man, he's a cool white boy.
Now this is what I'm
talking about. Tech dome, baby!
- Wow!
- Thousands of seats. Crowded, yo.
When they get in here,
they tear the roof off, yo.
See those seats
down there, man?
- Yeah?
- The ones in the front.
That's where all the alumni sit,
with all the money, man.
- Where? Right here?
- Yeah, man. I even got
my favorite seat, right here.
Wait. You can sit on mine.
I'm gonna warm this one up.
Feel that?
Feel the difference?
Now, introducing-- Number 34!
From Coney lsland,
Brooklyn, New York--
Jee-suuus Shuttlesworth!
Hello, son.
This is for you.
Coach Sunday.
I hope that Chick here
has been a gracious host.
Oh, Chick has been great.
Good. 'Cause we really know how
to treat our student athletes right.
- lsn't that right, Chick?
- Yeah, oh, yeah.
Coach is telling
the truth, man.
I hope you don't think we're too forward
or aggressive with the highlight film...
- or the jersey.
- No way.
- That's the way we are here
at Tech U. We show love.
- Much love. Much love.
Why beat around the bush?
We scouted you since you were
in junior high school.
We know all about you.
We love you.
You're a great kid. Not only a
great ballplayer, a great student,
but a beautiful human being.
When I read about how you've been
raising your sister all by yourself,
it made me want to cry.
I said to myself,
"That's the kind of young man...
"that will be the backbone
of this great country,
- not just the Tech University
basketball team."
- Tell it.
-You understand what I'm trying to say?
-Yes, sir.
When I heard...
that you were coming to visit,
I got down...
on my hands and knees...
and I prayed to God.
- Chick.
- Right here.
- Dear Lord, please...
- Please.
deliver Jesus to us.
I got down on my knees,
and I asked God...
to let Tech University
be the throne of Jesus.
As you already know, this will be
the most important decision...
of your life
that you'll ever make.
Yeah.
Son... don't blow it.
- Hi, Chick. How you doing?
- Hey, what's up, Molly?
- Hey, Chick.
- What's up, Liz?
- This is Jesus Shuttlesworth.
- Hi, Jesus.
- We're glad you're here.
- We're having a little talk.
Let us finish, and then we can
get up with y'all later. All right?
Okay. All right.
Nice meeting you.
- Bye.
- Nice seeing y'all.
Mm!
Lovely, huh?
Travel in packs too.
Mm!
You hit those?
- About 50% from the field.
- You lying.
You can have the rest.
I swear. Look, man.
We got some serious freaks
up here in this piece, man.
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, Jesus.
I was into my black bag
also, man.
Yo, I was keeping beautiful,
fine dark sisters.
Nubian sisters. Africa.
The whole nine. I'm telling you, man.
Well, you know,
I got a lady back in Brooklyn.
- Her name is Lala. We in love.
- I got a lady too.
She at home,
and she ain't here.
And I ain't talking about no love.
I'm talking about...
these white freaks
here at Tech U, man.
They love some ball-playing
brothers, man.
- Let you get your swerve on, man.
- I hear all that, but--
- What about the sisters?
- What about them?
I love them, but they
make you work too hard, man.
Them white girls over there, man,
they do your dirty drawers.
Wash 'em.
Cook for you.
- Give you money, man.
- Nuh-uh!
- Let you drive the Benz
their daddy bought.
- Oh, hell, no!
- They go the extra mile, man.
- You lying.
You see Molly
over there, man?
You can call her up at 4:00
in the morning, man.
"Bitch, get over here.
Let me spank you."
Man, before you hang the phone up,
she beating on the door.
- You don't even got
to kick your own bed out.
- Man, you lying.
- Buck!
- What's up, Buck?
- Peace, bro! Peace.
- What's up, man?
- We need to stay out in the hallway.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- Everybody in the hallway.
- This is a party. It's a long hallway.
You're good. Hey, where
the hell you at last night?
Always messin' around.
That's why I can't mess with y'all, man.
- We need to be out here.
- Don't worry about that.
I want you meeting
the assistant coaches.
- What are the assistant coaches
doing in the hallway?
- Yeah. Right here, man.
Lines and choruses
Days full of Doris's
Jesus, say hello
to Buffy and Suzie.
- Don't worry about the names.
- What's up?
Boy. I know you'll
take care of business.
Brooklyn is in the house.
Boy, keep it real.
Keep it real. It's up to you.
- Do what a black man gotta do.
- Where you goin'?
- Be right out here.
- You leavin'?
Holler if you need me, man.
Hey there.
- Sit down. Relax.
- Hi.
- Yeah. Sit down right here.
- Don't be nervous.
Beats in the game of rap, put my soul
in it, care less about the gold in it
Boom the shottie
Got the motherfuckin' paparazzi
- How're you doin'?
- I'm doin' fine.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. How are you?
-Good. How do you like your stay so far?
-It's been wonderful.
He's so nervous.
He's so tense. Very sexy.
I know. Just can't wait till next
season when you're going to school here.
- Can you?
- I can't wait.
- I know. Hmm.
- I can't wait.
Oh, Jesus!
Yes!
Yes, Jesus! Oh!
Eat it!
This guy, he's leaving me now.
He's right there.
And I'm just gonna...
you know, do whatever.
I'll call you later. I'll call
you later. All right. See you. Bye.
Hey, how you doin'? I'm Jake
Shuttlesworth. I'm Jesus's father.
Yeah, how are you?
- May I ask you a question,
talk to you about something?
- About what?
Well, number one, my son, he loves you
very much. You know that, right?
- Yeah. I feel the same way.
- Do you? That's good. That's lovely.
You haven't talked to him today?
Seen him, nothin' like that?
I was talkin' to him last night. He told
me that he was heading outta town today.
I don't remember where he was sayin'
he was goin' 'cause I was half-asleep.
- Nah, I haven't seen him.
- You sure?
- I haven't seen him.
- Okay.
Okay. He's waitin' for you?
- He's my big brother.
- He's your big brother?
Oh, okay. Yeah.
Yeah, I can see the resemblance.
- What are y'all? Dominican? Cuban?
- No.
- Borinquen, baby, thank you.
- Borinquen. Yeah, whatever.
- So, like, listen, Layla--
- Lala.
- Whatever.
- That's my name.
Whatever they payin' you,
I can do better than that.
Pay whom what? You ain't got
no real money anyway anyhow.
You ain't got to say that to me.
School's out. You know what I'm sayin'?
Here's what I'm sayin'.
We can help each other, all right?
You ain't got to play games with me.
Just listen to me for a second.
We can help each other.
If we work together, we can both get
what we want. You know what I'm sayin'?
Look, I don't know who you
been talking to or who you think I am,
but I'm the only one here who really,
really cares about Jesus.
- Is that right?
- Yes.
- Why don't you help me then,
since you really care about him?
- No.
What you need to do is let go of my arm.
Let go of my arm!
- No disrespect. No disrespect.
- Thank you.
I think you heard
what she's saying.
Look, son, why don't you--
What you got there, a Range Rover?
- "Son"?
- Why don't you get in your Range Rover.
- You ain't my pops.
- Don't be trying to blow up the spot!
I'm not trying
to disrespect you--
Huh? I didn't hear what you said.
- What you say?
- D'Andre!
- You can't talk now, huh?
Are you okay?
D'And-- D'Andre?
What do you want, what do you need
What will you find
Don't be afraid, don't fall asleep
Open your mind
I hope this rhyme gets you in time
in space, come to a different place
Will you hear spiritual lyrical
knowledge in your face to face
Like welfare In these rappers' lyrics
they need health care
Does KRS represent heaven
Hell, yeah
Let me take you elsewhere where
you stand is a curse there for sure
Unless you're mature, grow up
If you're immature
then you live in sinister
- Booger. Booger, what's happenin'?
- Hey, hey.
- How you doin', man? You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- Everything's good?
- Ah, you know, it's all right.
- Yeah. Seen my son?
- No, I ain't seen him.
- You ain't seen him?
- I ain't seen him.
Lyin' motherfucker.
You've seen him. Where he at?
- You're lyin', nigger. Where's he at?
- I'm not lyin', Uncle Jake.
Yeah, all the times you ever been
up eatin' in my motherfuckin' house.
- Where is he at?
- I talked to him yesterday.
- Where'd he say he was goin'?
- Yo, yo! Balloons. Two for a dollar.
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Let go. You're hurting my--
All right. I'm sorry.
You want some of this here?
My bad. It's my bad.
You all right? You straight?

- Oh, good, good.
That's good.
You want a hot dog?
Uh, naw, naw. Yo, uh, Borinquen,

- Okay, you got it.
- Yeah, it's, uh--
Not as fast as I expected, but it's
all gonna work out; I feel that.
When's your son
comin' back into town?
Y'all heard about that?
Oh, yeah,
the whole world heard about that.
- Look, I need some money.
- Mm-hmm.
You know, an advance or something
like that? I'm broke.
I hope you're not lookin' to buy no
plane, train or bus ticket outta here.
-Naw, nothin' like that.
-You're tryin' to pull a fast one on us?
- It's just I met a friend.
- Female friend?
A female friend, and I'd like to take
her someplace other than Nathan's.
Invite her up for one of them grilled
cheese sandwiches and orange soda.
Now, I know you haven't fell...
for that broken-down 'ho
you been messin' around with.
- What is a "'ho"?
Is that like a gardening tool?
- 'Ho, man. Whore.
Bitch that sells pussy.
Right, Jake?
She ain't no bitch and she ain't no 'ho.
The lady's name is Dakota. Dakota.
All right, Jake.
You don't have to get defensive.
We know you've been locked up
five and a half years. Pussy is pussy.
That's some
hard shit, my man, you know?
No poontang
in five and a half years.
I know you ain't been out
messin' around with them little boys.
- I ain't messin' with no little boys.
- Nobody tossed your salad?
Ain't nobody did
a motherfuckin' thing.
- I read in prison...
- I didn't engage in no
homosexual activities.
- that the guy who's doin' it--
- Y'all gonna give me the money?
Not the guy who's gettin' it up the
old kazoo, but the guy who's doin' it,
he doesn't consider himself
to be a faggot.
- Crudup.
- You think that's true?
Crudup. Just make sure
she's clean, my man.
That could be some dirty-ass pussy.
Go and knock yourself out.
Thank you.
It's all the film thing,
baby. It's all the film thing.
You see what I'm sayin'?
Lights, camera, action!
All right, Sweetness.
Here we go, baby.
- I'm makin' you some money tonight.
- Hey, baby.
How much for a blow job?
You wanna go for a ride?
You wanna have some fun?
- I wanna get my swerve on.
- Wanna go out?
Hey, baby,
you wanna party with me tonight?
This is my last 20 bucks.
You take that $20
back to your wife, honey.
This is your mama you're talkin' to.
Come here, baby.
- Dakota.
- What about you?
- What?
- Let's get outta here.
- Will you beat it. Damn!
- Let's get outta here.
- You are bad for business, okay?
- I got money, all right?
Let's get outta here.
Hey! What's
in the bag, all right?
Man!
Take a seat right there.
Yeah, huh?
Come on. Sit down.
Thanks.
Some of this right there.
For the lady...
and for the man.
- Mm, thanks.
- And for the boys upstate.
- Hey, don't waste it.
- Shit, they need it.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
So, um...
I like talking to you and all,
but don't let that fool you, you know.
There's no free pussy
around here, no freebies.
Sweetness will have my ass.
How much?
How much you wanna spend?
The whole shot.
How long have you
been locked up?
2,213 days.
That's six years,
23 days...
in the State.
Wow.
How many tricks you turn
in that time?
- All I count is the money.
- Yeah?
Why don't you
just pretend like--
Iike you mean it
or something?
- I'm a good actress.
- Are you?
Yeah.
Why don't you
take that wig off...
and be real for a minute.
I guess that's a requirement
of the job, huh? Right?
To be a good actress?
Act like it
means something?
Hmm?
Stand up.
Naw, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
Mmm.
Go slow.
It's a long time,
you know?
Mmm.
Two thousand.
Oh, damn.
Hey, look, why don't we
take this on over there.
Oh!
It's okay.
- It's okay.
- Sorry, l--
No. Nothin'
to be sorry about.
It's been a long time.
Anyway, we got all night.
I'm turning the meter off.
How was your trip, son?
Good.
Whose car is this?
- What, this brand-new Lexus?
- Yeah.
Well, technically,
it's mine.
It's registered in my name,
but it's for you.
- For me?
- How you like it?
LS400.
Look at that.
Power moon roof.
Got that, uh,
vehicle theft deterrent.
That's to deter them Coney lsland
Puerto Ricans from stealing your shit.
I never asked for a car.
Did I ever ask for a car?
- I asked for you.
- You must be outta your mojo mind.
If anybody sees me in this car,
that's my ass.
The way it was explained to me, as long
as it's in my name, it's all good.
This shit
is all fucked up.
You gotta take it back,
give it back, do what you gotta do.
I don't even wanna know
who you got it from either.
You don't like the color?
What you want? Blue, black, white?
- You take it back.
- Sh--
- Mm, so how was your trip?
- My trip? Oh, I had a great trip.
Best one, so far?
You think?
I don't know. I mean,
they're all the same,
but you just have a good time
with all of them.
We all do the same things-- go partyin',
meet all the guys, go to classes.
I mean, it was just--
It's off the hook.
- Did you miss me, Jesus?
- Of course I missed you.
That's all I did
was talk about Lala.
Did you meet any women at the parties,
in the dorms and stuff like that?
Did I meet any women?
There were women at this college.
There are women all over the place.
I mean, there's women on the floor,
in the dorms, women in the classroom.
There's a women's basketball team,
track team. Women all over the place.
Of course I met women.
I got introduced to everybody.
I said hello. That's about it.
- So did you fuck anybody
while you were out there?
- Hell, no!
Don't think I haven't heard stories
about these white college bitches.
Me with a white bitch?
They got 'em all lined up,
waitin' to suck your dick.
If my mother ever saw me with
a white bitch, she'd spin in her grave.
Then she's spinning.
She's turnin' over and over and over.
Don't be talking about my mother,
all right? Please.
All right.
D'Andre and Dom need to know something.
Goddamn.
I should've known.
- What?
- This whole world is bugged.
And you're in it with 'em.
You're in cahoots with D'Andre and Dom.
Don't even lie.
Tell me the truth.
I knew that ever since
I left that house.
Ever since I walked in the house,
as a matter of fact.
And why shouldn't
I get paid, huh?
Why shouldn't Lala get something
outta this? Everybody else is.
I can't believe this.
I really can't.
Well, you believe it.
I believed you when you said...
that you would never
leave me, Jesus.
And I believed you when you asked me
to get that abortion.
When you begged me
to get that abortion, I believed you.
- We both agreed on that.
- I wanted that child.
- I wanted to know
what you think because it's--
- What I think?
A baby's gonna hurt
my chance of going to college.
I mean, the top schools,
they're gonna be scared away. Damn!
I'm too young. You're too young.
We ain't ready for nothin' like this.
How did we get pregnant anyway?
Let's talk about that.
Are you sure?
I'm not getting pregnant
now, papi.
I just wanna
feel you inside of me...
without a jimmy.
"l can't get pregnant, papi.
I wanna feel you
inside of me, papi."
- lsn't that what you said?
- Lala has to look out for herself.
Lala played herself,
that's what she did.
And don't think I don't know about
that D'Andre kid either.
- Did you fuck him?
- So what?
At least I can admit it.
- Oh, so it makes it all right
that you admit it--
- I'm not saying it's all right.
I'm just saying that there's a reason
and I can at least admit it.
- That don't mean shit.
- That don't mean shit?
- Go fuck all of Coney lsland.
- Well, you know what?
If it don't matter,
then why are you stressing?
- You're gonna wake up a whole
bunch of angry black folk.
- I don't give a fuck!
You know
you're gonna leave me.
This is gonna last while you're off
to college for a year?
You want me to live in Lala-land?
Is that what it is?
How do you know?
Tell me how you know.
- I know 'cause I ain't stupid.
- You went to a fortune teller?
You don't know shit.
You don't know what's gonna happen.
Jesus, I have read
all about...
those high school sweethearts
who get left behind.
I have seen that movie
many a time.
I told 'em nobody can tell Jesus
what to do, but they fucking insisted.
If they were stupid enough
to give me money...
to use some kind of influence
over you that I never possessed,
so be it.
They put the money in my hand
with the promise of more to come.
Just like
everybody else.
Jesus, you have
no problems.
Your life is set.
You got no worries.
- I have nothing.
- Yeah, right.
You're gonna honestly lie
dead to my face and tell me...
that it was gonna be forever
and you were gonna take care of me...
and that I had no problems
or no worries?
- That wasn't hard for me.
- Oh, my God.
Come here.
That's it. Come here!
Good riddance.
What's up, son?
So, this is it, yo?
Judgment day?
Father and son?
Jake and Jesus?
So you ain't gonna
say nothin' to me. Okay.
I ain't got no more time to be tryin'
to beg your forgiveness or nothin',
so I'll make this
real simple.
This right here,
it's a letter of intent...
for you to sign
to go to Big State.
Right?
Right there.
I'll play you,
one-on-one, to 11.
I win, you sign.
You win, you do what you wanna do.
Tear it up, whatever.
I go back to Attica, 'cause I know
that's what you really want. Right?
- You wanna play me one-on-one?
- One-on-one.
-lf I win, you get the hell outta here?
-I ain't stuttered, son.
- The hell outta my life?
- Forever.
- I'll take the bet. You're on.
- Bet.
You wanna take them shines off,
that gold?
You gonna take
that LoJack off?
It don't come off, son.
Check.
Aah!
That's one.
- That's the only basket
you gettin' all game.
- Check.
One.
I can count.
That's one.
Two.
Two-one. That's somethin'
you taught me.
That's right.
I taught you well, son.
A lot of things you learned from me.
This your ball?
- What you stallin' for?
- Everything you got you got from me.
Everything you got.
- Let me show you what you taught me.
- Yeah, show me. Show me!
Show me!
I didn't teach you that,
though, did l?
That's somethin'
I didn't teach you.
- That was luck.
- That's somethin' you gotta
learn on your own.
Give it up. Give it up.
Oh, why you do--
Oh, yeah!
Who taught you that one?
I think I'll go around again.
- Yeah!
- It's your ball.
Mmm, I feel refreshed.
You better shoot it. That's a brick.
All right, we gon' cut out
all that lucky shit.
- What's that?
- That's three.
- You gon' play me?
- Yeah. I'm just warmin' up, baby.
I give you that.
- You better play some defense.
- I give you that.
Don't give me too many.
Yeah. Where you at, baby?
That's my rock.
Yeah, that was luck, anyway.
That's luck too, baby.
- Just call me the leprechaun.
- That's your last basket.
Yeah. I'm a lucky Negro.
You ready?
All right.
Oh, I forgot.
Payback is a bitch, huh?
Yeah.
Oh, don't get mad. You're the one
that taught me to be a good sportsman.
Ball up.
What you want,
the jump shot dunk?
What?
Huh?
- Bottoms.
- What's that?
- Seven to a lucky five.
- Seven to a lucky five.
- Eight-five.
- Eight-five.
I'm about to send you
down there with them.
- Nine-five.
- You quittin'?
- I can take a loss.
- You just gon' give up, huh?
- I ain't givin' up.
- You just gon' give up.
I'm teachin', brother. I'm teachin',
son, like I always taught you.
Oh, you tired?
Get that outta here.
You're earnin' these two.
Ohh!
I thought you lifted weights
in Attica, in the joint. Huh?
Point game.
Just play the game.
Just play the game?
I learned that from you.
You better "D" up, Jake.
Point game.
This is your last chance.
Come on, move away.
Ohh!
Ohh!
Aah!
Game time.
What you lookin' around for?
That's game-- 11-5.
Jake.
Somebody call a stretcher.
Stick a fork in 'im.
He's done.
Take your old ass
back to Attica.
All right.
What?
Make you feel like a man now?
Huh?
Maybe you could stop hatin' me.
Is that gonna bring
your mother back?
- Maybe we could start bein'
father and son again.
- You ain't my father.
Let me tell you somethin'.
You look out for yourself.
You look out for your sister.
You ain't got to worry
about me no more.
But you get that hatred
out your heart, boy,
or you gon' end up
just another nigger,
Iike your father.
It's your ball.
Well, Jake, I think it's time
for all of us to go back home.
- Okay.
- No. No, Jake.
Turn around.
Let's go.
Let him go. Huh?
Jesus.
Jesus!
I'm gonna read a, uh,
prepared statement from Jesus.
"I'm sorry for not bein'
with you this morning,
"but under the circumstances my family
and I have chosen to be alone.
"This past week has been
a very difficult week for me.
"I've done a lot of praying
and have asked for guidance from above.
"And I do believe that God
has shown me the way.
"My sister Mary
will be coming with me.
"She will attend seventh grade
at a neighboring junior high school.
"This September I will
be enrolled at Big State University...
- on a full--"
- on a full athletic scholarship."
- Yes!
- Bullshit!
Later!
This shit is bogus.
The boy did not go for the bucks.
Hold on.
"This is the right place for me.
"ln closing, my family and I send
our prayers out to my father.
"May God bless him.
Yours, truly,
Jesus Shuttlesworth."
"Jake Shuttlesworth...
- "a... convict--
- Convicted.
- convicted mur... der..."
- Murderer.
Gimme the paper, man.
You're irking me with that shit.
About to graduate,
you can't even read, dumb ass.
Can too read. Miss Janus says
I got problems readin' out loud.
- He's just nervous.
- Man, fuck that, Sip. Finish readin'.
Gladly.
"The father of the number-one basketball
prospect Jesus Shuttlesworth...
"was captured last night in the Coney
lsland section of Brooklyn, New York...
- "after a week-long manhunt.
- What?
"He had escaped the maximum security
Attica State Penitentiary...
"seven days before.
No official word yet
on how he escaped."
How could Uncle Jake have escaped when
they let him walk out the front gate?
There's gotta be some truth
to it if it's in the papers.
Oh, come on, man!
Yo, Shuttlesworth.
Warden wants to see you now.
He say what this is about?
Things didn't work out
exactly as we planned,
but the governor got
what he wanted.
I'm happy for him.
Why do you think my son did it?
I haven't had the pleasure of meeting
your son as yet. I can't speculate.
- Maybe someday you'll get
to ask him that in person.
- Someday.
And when will that be,
Warden?
The governor
has yet to inform me.
For your information,
technically...
you did not get your son
to sign the letter of intent.
Hopefully that's not gonna
make a difference.
- We need some time.
- Well, I got that, huh?
Dear Jesus, ever since you was born
I been pushin' you,
tryin' to make you the best ball player
that you could possibly be,
tryin' to make you the ball player
that I never was.
I finally came
to the realization...
that I was pushin' you
further and further away from me also.
I believe that things
gon' work out for the best for you,
- Jesus was a name.
- for Mary.
You got the game.
Sip, sip, sip on this.
Your great-grandfather always used to
tell me that you keep tryin' on shoes,
sooner or later you gon'
find a pair that fit you.
The... farmhouse...
Well, I'm here to testify
that I found a pair.
House. O-U-sss...
They hurt like hell, son.
- I love you.
- "l love you, son."
Your father,
Jake Shuttlesworth.
Five, four, three, two, one.
And the crowd goes wild.
Uh-oh. He's heatin' up.
You can't stop him.
You can only hope to contain him.
Jake, stop!
Stop right there!
Turn around!
Do it now, or you're a dead man!
Turn around and back up!
Yeah, that's right,
this cut goes out to all y'all...
that's been missin' us for mad years.
One love, yo. Hey, that's right.
He's got game.
P.E., 1998.
If man is the father
the son is the center of the earth
In the middle
of the universe
Then why is this verse
comin' six times rehearsed
Don't freestyle much
but I write 'em like such
Amongst the themes
controlled by the screens
What does it all mean
All this shit I'm seein'
Human bein's
screamin' vocal javelins
Sign of a local nigga
unravelin'
- Uh-huh
- My wanderin' got my ass wonderin'
Where Christ is
in all this crisis
Hatin' Satan
never knew what nice is
Check the papers
Well, I bet on ices
More than your eyes can see
and ears can hear
Year by year
all the sense disappears
Nonsense perseveres
Prayers laced with fear
- Beware Two-triple 0 is near
- It might feel good
It might sound
a little somethin'
But damn the game
if it don't mean nothin'
What is game, who got game
Where's the game in life
Behind
the game behind the game
I got game, she got game, we got game
they got game, he got game
It might feel good
It might sound a little somethin'
- But fuck the game
if it ain't sayin' nothin'
- Damn
Was it somethin' I said
Pretend you don't see
so you turn your head
Race scared of his shadow
Does it matter
The thought of reparation's got him
playin' with the population
Nothin' to lose
Everything approved
People use
Even murders excused
White men in suits
don't have to jump
Still 1,001 ways
to lose with the shoes
God takes care
of old folks and fools
While the devil takes care
of makin' all the rules
Folks don't even
own themselves
Payin' mental rent
to corporate presidents
- My man, my man
- One out of one million residents
Be a dissident
who ain't kissin' it
The politics
of chains and whips
Got the six missing chips
and all the championships
What's love got to do
with what you got
Don't let a win get to your head
or a loss to your heart
- Word
- Nonsense perseveres
Prayers laced with fear
Beware
Two-triple 0 is near
It might feel good
It might sound a little somethin'
But damn the game
if it don't mean nothin'
What is game, who got game
Where's the game in life
Behind
the game behind the game
I got game, she got game, we got game
they got game, he got game
It might feel good
It might sound a little somethin'
But fuck the game
if it ain't sayin' nothin'
Yeah, that's right.
Everybody got game.
But we just here to let you all know
that P.E. is in full effect...
from right now
till the year 2000.
Hey, yo, my man, sing it.
There's something happening here
- Yeah, yeah.
- What it is
Ain't exactly clear
There's a man
- With a gun over there
- Yeah, that's right. Ha-ha!
Tellin' me
I got to beware
It's time we stopped, children
What's that sound
Everybody look
what's goin' down
Hey, yo, I don't think
they heard you, Stephen.
Kick it to 'em again one more time.
It's time we stopped, children
What's that sound
Everybody look
what's goin' down
Thought of that millennium
just be killin' 'em
And that's scary
Like lies buried in a library
I ain't even gotta ask it
And who's underpaid that
got fouled at the basket
I can't blame the M.V. who be
gettin' all the Benjies
And takin' them grants
for granted
Last I checked pyramids
wasn't built like projects
Or on them
government checks, uhh
Modern-day thugs
ain't got no guts
Pardon the expression
And the governor nuts
Last time in a church
be the last time in a church
Dead pledge allegiance
to CDs and movies
Leavin' reality
Believe in fantasy
Bleedin' fatalities
Too many formalities
Prayers laced with fear
Beware
Two-triple 0 is here
It might feel good
It might sound a little somethin'
But damn the game
if it don't mean nothin'
What is game, who got game
Where is the game in life
Behind
the game behind the game
I got game, she got game, we got game
they got game, he got game
It might feel good
It might sound a little somethin'
But fuck the game
if it ain't sayin' nothin'
Ahh, ohh, what's that sound
- I got game, she got game
- Everybody knows
- We got game, they got game
he got game
- What's going down
Ahh, ohh, what's that sound
- I got game, she got game
- Everybody knows
- We got game, they got game
he got game
- What's going down
Ahh, ohh, what's that sound
- I got game, she got game
- Everybody knows
- We got game, they got game
he got game
- What's going down
Ahh, ohh, what's that sound
- I got game, she got game
- Everybody knows
- We got game, they got game
he got game
- What's going down
Ahh, ohh, what's that sound
Everybody knows
what's going down
Ahh, ohh
What's that sound
Everybody knows
what's going down
