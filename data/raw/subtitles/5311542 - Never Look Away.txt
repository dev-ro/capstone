WORK  WITHOUT  AN  AUTHOR 
.

ladies and Gentlemen.
Until the seizure of power
by the National Socialists
.
There has been such
modern art in Germany.
.
so that means, as it already
is in the nature of this word,
.
almost every year a different one.
National Socialist Germany
wants a German art again,
.
around this so....
like all the creative values of a
people, be an eternal one.
.
but if it lacks such an
eternal value for our people,
.
then it is without merit today.
The German woman is mocked
and equated with prostitutes.
.
The soldier is called murderer
and a senseless sacrifice
.
represented in the sense of
a Bolshevik class struggle.
.
the people should have a
deeply rooted respect
.
for the soldier's bravery
and not be cast like this..
And insanity, mental
illness, becomes a principle.
.
it must be accepted,
that there are men who are the
present-day figures of our people
.
only to see them as degenerate cretins?
the fundamental 
meadows blue, sky green
.
clouds are sulfur yellow
and so is the weather
.
or, as you might say, "experience"?
.
there are only two options.
either these so-called artists
really see things like that
and therefore believe
in what they represent.
.
The answer would be: to subcribe
'whether by looking or by accident'
.
or through heredity this has come about.
a case deeply regrettable
for these unhappy ones,
.
in the second important task for
the Reich Ministry of Interior,
.
which would then have the task,
at least one more inheritance
.
to prevent such gruesome
visual disturbances.
.
or they themselves do not believe
in the reality of these impressions,
.
but try for other reasons,
to burden the nation
with this humbug.
.
then such an offense falls into
the field of criminal justice.
.
What does this have to do with art?
How does it lift the soul?
.
What does this have to do with being able?
Because "art" comes from "can".
.
-I think you could paint this too.
Yes, my boy, you could. 
try it.
.
And when you're done,
you ask your parents,
.
if they will give you a penny for it.

do you know what they paid 
Mr Wassily Kandinsky for that?
.
- 2000 marks.
- (Man,softly) What?
.
more than the annual
salary of a German worker.
.
What does your dad do?
- He's out of work right now..
2000 marks from taxpayers of
the working German population.
.
We will see to it that the people...

Maybe I do not want
to become a painter.
.
Do not tell
anyone, but I like it.
.

Aunt Elisabeth,
did you see how they looked at you?
.
no one will have eyes
for me on Monday.
.
since everyone will cheer only for Hitler.
- Good afternoon.
- I think you're better than Hitler.
.
- Hello.
- Good afternoon. A trip with your nephew?
.
- Thank you.
- Have a good trip.
- Thank you.
.

Over There, there was our apartment
What do you miss most about Dresden?
sometimes it helps to name it exactly.
I know who you miss.
the girl with the fiery red pigtails.
What's her name again?  Johanna?
- Johanna, right? Your lover?
- Mhm.
.
- No 
- not just Johanna.
.
- who else do you miss?
- the Schrdders.
.
you know?
- the old couple in our house.
- Mm.
.
the ones who always hold hands.
like little kids.
.
I like them.  and the dachshund Thilo.
whenever I called
him, he came to me.
.
There are only 45 kilometers
from us to Dresden.
.
you can visit them
as often as you want.
.
Hm?
of course you are right.
Dresden is simply unbeatable.
.

You know what?
I think your father is very strong. 
that he does not join the party.
.
a signature,
and he could take his place as a
teacher and keep the apartment.
.
Dad thinks it is criminal,
how the Nazis...
.
shh, shh, I know.
So you do not talk to anyone
else about this, right?
.
Mum says she will
still get him to join.
.
the membership is then his capitol.
his capital.
- goodbye, Miss May.
- goodbye.
.
Hold this for a moment
Aunt Elisabeth,
have you forgotten something '?
.
(Man) Hey, Eddie.
There is little May again.
.
- (Eddie) Let's do her the favor.
- Karl, ready?
.
- (Karl) Good.
- (Eddie) At the same time.
.
- (Man) Good, on three.  
- One, two, three.
.







(Man) Take care.
Thank you.
To paint a picture that feels like this...
that's what they're trying to do,
these degenerate artists.
.
(Woman) Oh Elisabeth, late again.
And how you look!
.
(Officer) Chest out.  Chin up.
You.
first row.  Come over.
you will hand him the bouquet.
(distant crowd, cheering) Heil!  Heil!

Heil! Heil!
Heil! Heil! Heil!
Heil! Heil!
Heil! Heil! Heil!






(Elisabeth) Do not look away.
Never look away, Kurt.
everything that is true is already true.




This sound...
this is the whole power of music.
of life.
of the whole universe.
.

people are looking for the cosmic formula.
but here it is.
here.

do you hear that?
the two-line A, at the May's Bluthner piano in Grossschonau.

and now that I know it...
I can play it anywhere.
on the table.
do you hear?
even on my head.

- Aunt Elisabeth, you are bleeding.
- even on my head.
.
Elisabeth.
what are you doing?
a concert for the Fuhrer.
Youth Mania?
that sounds almost sympathetic.
.
(Elisabeth) "Schizophrenia", "Youth Mania".
I can hear that.
.
I think it's nothing
that a little time out
could not heal.
.
- A little time out...
- In an institution, yes.
.
can't we do it at home?
she studied very hard for her high school diploma,
and went straight into bilingual education..
.
(Doctor) Elisabeth?
maybe she's just overexerted..
Is that your wife?
you can't stand her, can you?
that's what I see in the way you stand there.
.
(Mother,) Elisabeth.
wait outside until we
have finished the interview.
.
I will not ask again.

since schizophrenia is
hereditary, I am obliged to ask:
.
are there any other cases of
mental illness in her family?
.
for God's sake, no.
- depression ?
- we are all happy.
.
we doctors are the watchmen on
the bank of the hereditary stream.
.
I have to report this to the health department.
the decision on admission
may not be up to you.
.
Dr. Michaelis...
Franz.
I know your parents.
and your grandparents.
.
Please,
do not report it.

I won't, because it is you, Mrs. May.
but tell me,
If the Condition worsens, ok?
.
- Goodbye. 
- Heil Hitler.
.
- Yes, of course, Heil Hitler.
- (Kurt's mother) Heil Hitler.
.
Ms. Vermimung.
please connect
me to the health department.
.

- (Elisabeth) Goodbye, Gunther.
- (man 1) Mrs. May we have to go.
.
- (Gunther) Alright.
- (Man 2) We will miss you.
.
- (Mother) It's only for a few weeks.
- (Gunther) See you soon.
.
Goodbye, Ehrenfried.
(Kurt's father) Goodbye.
We will miss you.
.
I do not want to go, Mom.
Kurt, go back inside.
Kurt.
- I do not want to go!
- (Nurse 1) Get her legs.
.
No!
- Do you have her? 
- Yes.
.
No! 
(Nurse 2) Come on.
(Doctor) keep still.
- she'll be all right.

(Doctor) scopolamine, it works fast.
(Caregiver 1) buckle her up.

- (Mother) The suitcase.
- (Ehrenfried) Oh yes, of course.
.
- These are her things.
- Yes / Yes.
.
Never look away.


My dear colleagues.
I want to congratulate you.
the weakest percent
of the German people
.
have been rendered infertile since
the introduction of the law.
.
400,000.
a proud number.
a contribution to generations,,
future Generations
will thank you..
.
I now hope that one day we will
live in a world
in which the streets are completely
free of mongoloid, mentally ill
.
and other freaks.
but now it seems to me time
to switch to the next gear.
.
also, due to the English air strikes
we have an increased need
for alternative hospitals.
.
we can't let this happen,
that a German soldier
.
is denied a hospital bed,
just because it is being used for
nurturing and caring for unworthy life.
.
- How can we help?  
- What can we do?
.
Thank you for this question, Carl.
Gentlemen,
from now on you will no longer
be just Doctors and SS men.
.
you will become assessors of
the Heritage Health Court.
.
what does that mean?
well,
a patient you made infertile
.
and whose registration form you have
marked with a blue minus sign,
.
remains in the asylum.
.
but if we see a red plus here,
we understand that
this is a worthless life,
.
and this patient will go to
one of three institutions
.
in the eastern most part of the Reich
and there liberated from
a meaningless existence.
.
Your pen.
Your sword ..


examination and preliminary talk.
Elisabeth May, 23 years old.
.
- sterilization appointment today at 15:45.
- Thank you.
.
- you can go in


You can sit there.

Did your daughter paint that?
Why do you think you are here?
because sometimes I
do not think right.
.
Do you know what kind of clinic I manage?
a gynecological clinic.
A lovely girl, your daughter.
I can see that in the picture.
not much artistic talent.
you might be unhappy happy about that.
but a lot of heart.
.
I have a nephew that age.
he is very talented
I take him to exhibitions.
to educate him.
.
good.
please lie down in the adjoining
room on the examination chair.
.
your clothes... 
- (man) I want to see Professor Seeband!
- Excuse me for a moment.
.
(Man) I've wanted an appointment for weeks.
I don't get an answer!
.
- I have a right to it!
- Sorry Professor, I could not stop him.
.
Mr. Lohse-Wachtler.
They asked me, "Do you want
that, your daughter's suffering
.
carried on to the
next generation? "
.
that's why I agreed to the Operation.
What about my daughter's suffering now?
.
- (Seeband) Show some respect.
- what about my suffering?
.
I won't continue this Conversation..
I'll show you, Professor Seeband.
At the Reichs-Arztekammer.
.
Do that, Mr. Lohse-Wachtler.
Do that.
.
you have sworn an oath as a doctor.
Let me go.
.
- at some point, it will catch up with you.
- (Carer) Go.
.
(Lohse-Wachtler) it will catch up with you!
it will catch up with you!
it will catch up with you!
Professor Seeband!  Someday !
(Carer) Quiet.
It would have been better,
that you had not seen that.
.
- I am of healthy descent.
- Three reviewers see it differently.
.
- No! 
- Sit back down.
.

You're going into the Examination Room now
And afterwards in the Operating room.
.
and you will cooperate there.

otherwise we'll have you strapped down
and everything gets
harder and more painful.
.
Please, Mr. Seeband...
Professor, please.
for the Fuhrer. I will give birth to
children. Healthy, Aryan children.
.
and I will give them to the Führer,
as we're supposed to.
.
my children will also give
their children to the Fuhrer.
.
- (nurse) Come on.
- (Elisabeth) For the war!
.
you need soldiers, don't you?
you need soldiers!
.

I'm just confused sometimes.
Only very rarely.
Please don't! 
.
Please, I do not want to.
- (nurse) Come on now...
- Guys, I need help!

- Anna. 
- yes Herr Professor?
.
I won't operate on Miss May myself.
Tell Blockman.
.
- He's at the Kressaal.
- Then you make the changes.
.

Thank you.
Careful !
How Chic you look in the uniforms.
that will make Elisabeth happy.
.
Johann?
Yes.
- You know...
- Yes, after the war, that's my capital.
.
and do not forget the greeting.  "Heil Hitler".
.
If you can't get it across your lips,
say a fast "three liters".
.
no one will notice.
.
- and none of the painting you do all the time.
- and certainly nothing of these naked people.
.
(Sister 1) The same photographer?
Nobody has commissioned him?
.
Heil Hitler.
Three liters.
We're booked for a visit.
with Elisabeth May.
.
I am Johann Barnert, the brother-in-law.
these are her brothers
Ehrenfried and Gunther May.
.
this is her sister Waltraud.
and her mother Malvine.
.

Elisabeth May.
was relocated the day before yesterday.
.
Relocated? It can't be.

by Command of the central office.
When?
(Photographer) Two are missing?
Kathe, we're ready.
Where was she transferred?
- Hospital Grossschweidnitz.
- (Malvine) Grossschweidnitz?
.
that's two days from here.
how can we visit her there?
.
we have to work.
the boys are on leave now.
.
That's all I can tell you.
I have to go now.  Heil Hitler.
That's him, all right..
(Ehrenfried) I will write to the Ministry.
- (Photographer) Please look here.






(Song: "De torrente in via bibet"
from Handels "Dixit Dominus")
.

Tin foil strips.  I read about that.
they're using it to interfere with radio and radar.


(Mother) Johanna!  Johanna, wake up!
Johanna... - Mommy... Mom!
This way !  
There's a embankment ahead.
.
Heads down!

(Ehrenfried) Gunther!


I like you.
I like you too.









(Man) Yeah, good.  
that's how it's done.
.

- Mr. Seeband?
- Professor Seeband. Yes, that's me.
.

Mr. Seeband...
Professor Seeband.
What did he say?
.
.
He wishes you to address
him as "Professor."
.
.
Agreed, Professor.
.
.

Where is Burghard Kroll?
- Who? 
- Burghard Kroll.
.

the head of the Reich's working group.
we know about your meeting in Berlin.
I do not know, what you are talking about.
I do not know the man.
.


I still do not know him.


(Interpreter) If my child
is not born healthy,
.
does it then deserve to die?
There are limited space and
resources on this earth.
.
Who should have that?
the sick or the healthy?
.


In any case, a place will soon
be available on this earth.
.

You did not specify
if you were a party member.
.
Were you a party member?
- Mr Director, I have been very long time...
- yes or no, Mr Barnert?
.
Yes.
but I'm not a Nazi.
I mean, three quarters of all
teachers were in the party.
.
We want to entrust the youth to
the remaining quarter. Good day.
.

(Russian woman) I'm hot.
.


(Seeband quietly uttering
Russian vocabulary)
.







Comrade?

Comrade!
.
.
.
- What?
- The labour pauses do not bring her peace.
.
.
.
The child is wrong.
It can not come out.
.
(Russian) How?
.
.
Call the interpreter.
Immediately.
.
.




He mistrusts you.
he asks why you want to help.
.
I want to help because I can.

You can go.
.
.


(Russian woman) A Gypsy woman told me...
I will not have any children.
.
.
That is my destiny...
.
.
- Crosswise, please. 
- Lay her across the bed.
.
- which week?

- (interpreter) 36.
- (seeband) blood pressure ?
.
(interpreter) 110 over 70.
(Russian woman) How could I believe you
that I can have children?
.
.

Tell her a child she will
definitely have.
.
after that, many more.

The child is crosswise.
during the contractions, the
uterus is too hard to rotate.
.
I will open the amniotic sac.
in a labour pause
I'll turn the child around.
.

I'm a military interpreter...

(Major) Do it.
(seeband) gloves.
The vodka, please.
(seeband) Do not touch.

We will do it without anesthesia.
Seeband) I already have a leg.
(Seeband) Let's wait for the next contraction.

(Seeband) I put my index
finger in the child's mouth.
.

(Seeband) I'm laying the
chin on the chest...
.
and slowly pull it's head out.


(Seeband, in Russian) 
A boy, a healthy boy...
.
.

(Interpreter) Alexander Mikhailovich.
and a healthy,
beautiful mother.
.
.
.
I congratulate you, Major.

Whoever saves a
life, saves the whole world.
.
.
.
You saved my world,
.
.
.
Professor.
.
.
.
Nobody will touch a hair on your head.
.
.
.
You are now under my
personal protection.
.
.
.
Make the guest room ready
for the professor...
.
.
.
... and give him decent clothes.
.
.
.




Father,
you do not have to worry anymore.
I understand, I got it.
- What? What did you understand?
- Everything, everything.
.
how everything relates.
that everything is connected.
.
everything.
the world formula.
I...
I never have to worry again.
I never need to be afraid again.
.
I am untouchable.
That's nice.
No, father, you do not understand.
.
You do not have to worry anymore.
Really.
.
I do not even have to become an
artist anymore. I can take any job.
.
and I will always find the right
thing, the true one.
.
I'm glad for you, really.
I have to hold it.
I have to hold it somehow.
I understand.
I know who you're thinking about.
but he is different.

- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning, my boy.
.
The registration, colleague.

are you doing this to make
you feel better than us?
.
What?
drawing the shapes freehand,
while we worry ourselves with stencils.
.
do you want to show us up?
why are you doing this?
.
I do it because I can.

Have you been waiting for a long time?
Then take care.  Until tomorrow.
You can take the pens with you,
if you bring them back
.
In January applications open for the
Academy of Arts,
.
I am satisfied with this work.
What the fuck are you doing?
Does that help the worker?
does that give your father strength,
cleaning stairs?
.
you want to help him, don't you?
you even got him the job.
you have seen a lot of shit, right?
but does it help you to revel in it?
does that help build a world
where your children feel better?
.
that's what communism is about.
I will support your application.
at the art academy,
the girls are more pretty than here.
.



(Lecturer) Can you see
That someone here has
left all his vanity aside
.
and put himself in the service of the
cause, in the service of the People?
.
work on your attitude.
work on your craft.
.
and the right art
will emerge by itself.
.
as a warning example I would like
to show you Pablo Picasso...
.
from which there are
strong realistic images,
.
who made a real solidarity with
the working class clear...
.
but very soon
slipped into a decadent,
obscene formalism.
.
Why?
because he wanted to be considered
a renewer, not a traditionalist.
.
innovation, schoperic
independence, artistic freedom.
.
words that sound
appealing to an artist.
.
I I I.
but real freedom can
only win a modern artist,
.
when he puts himself at the service
of the interests of the people.
.
the "I, me, me" leads only to bad luck.
in the best case,
it leads to being withheld
.
by decadent, rich collectors.
exploiters of the workers
who are indulging in
.
that they have nothing in
common with the people,
.
not even the art taste.
.
decay, mysticism, pornography.
empty forms, artificial constructions.
blots, lines, balls cones.
all this just to be
considered as a renewer?
.
yes, it is new.
but it is also wrong.
and it's vain and stupid,
undemocratic, decadent.
.
be different, gentlemen.
be different.
.
The hammer was a bit higher earlier.
Yes, that's right,
it was a whole lot higher.
.
Yes, a little bit more.
So here?
And the left hand in the middle.
.
Yes, exactly, and the right
one was a lot higher.
.
Anything else. 
Yes, higher.
.
One more piece.
.
So?
higher, higher.
.
Right forward.
Exactly.  That's how it's done, right?
Yes, that's how it works.
That's how it works.
.
Nah, it was not like that.
.
Cut the bullshit..
It was a bit higher up.
Nope,  But below.
Nah, it was up.
right
Down, up, down, up,
down, up.
Comrade Professor?
Comrade Professor,
the students are playing crazy.
.
(Model) In any case,
I also carry a great responsibility here.
.
Yes, 
are we in kindergarten?
.
yes, it seems that way.


Hey, in fashion they're giving
away Western art pencils.
.

Sorry.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
.
2B. Thank you.
Hello, Ernst.
.
It's great that you share these.
Of course, with pleasure.
.
Greetings to Lise from me.
I will.
.

Thank you, Elisabeth.
Do not worry.
she belongs to me.
.
Watch to learn how to do it.
2B or 4B?
well?
Ah...
.
2B, but
much better I had a
date with you.
.
Let's leave it at the pencil.
Are you sure?
.
Sure.
Your name is Elisabeth?
Do you want one too?
There are only 4B left now.
Thank you.
A gold pheasant like you does
not deserve an ordinary jack.
.
Golden Pheasant?
Yes.
That does not sit well with me.
.
I feel the same way.
A walk?
through the park?
So that I can correct
my misjudgment?
.
You wanted to talk to me after all.
actually,
I wanted to go for a walk with you.
.
Alright.
Then I'll just make conversation.
Socialist Realism.
Is that your thing?
Probably the same
as yours is Lotte Ulbricht's fashion..
.
why do you always look at me like that?
You remind me of someone.
Would you like to paint me?
I do not know...
Would you like to
tailor a suit for me?
.
I have to go home.
May I accompany you?
Only to the door.


You take dance lessons?
I live here.  The house is ours.
You have not refuted the
golden pheasant right now.
.
had only luck.
not a single bomb hit.
.
before the war, the whole street looked like this.
Goodbye, Kurt.
Goodbye...
Elisabeth.
Can I call you somehow different?
do you have a nickname'?
.
Actually, all of them call me Elisabeth.
"Actually" means exactly
the opposite is true.
.
Alright.
My dad calls me Ellie.
Goodbye, Ellie.

Elisabeth.








(Lecturer) Pay more attention to the view.
and more volume, yes?
.
You could have taken a bit
longer, Kurt.
.
Good

It's over for today.
Ah yes, good night.  
Good night.
.
Until tomorrow.


A gold pheasant as a worker?
You are my semester project now.
a suit.  for you.

I'll never take it off.

You are so Beautiful.
That's almost unromantic.
.
It is far too easy to love you.
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Otherwise it will not work for me.
Otherwise, I can't do this..
I love you.
Really?
Yes.


I love you.
I love you.
I love you.

My parents.
I thought they live in Chemnitz.
They do.


My dad.
What are we going to do?













- (Mother) And Elisabeth?
- Sleeping tight.
.
She Left a candle burning.
When will she finally grow up?
.
Yes, the youth.
Among friends
what were you doing..
.
I was gardening.
.
I see, gardening.
I guess you have
a really green thumb..
.
Ah, here she comes, your gardening.
Come on, boys.

Thank you for risking your
life for my reputation.
.
Never do something
so crazy again.
.
Did your parents...
They did not notice.
.
nothing at all.
they're moving back to Dresden.
my dad gets his old post
as clinic director again.
.
but he still has a room to rent
because if he doesn't.
the Housing Department is coming in.
.
he wants to put up a sign on Monday.
don't you want to...?
to discover the sign first?
just by chance?
that I would then fall in love with
a tenant selected by them,
.
they cannot deny me that..
Your mother, um...
won't she suspect somethig
.
Oh, Mummy,she has such an innocent mind.
you don't have to worry about her.
she won't notice a thing.
.
really,  nothing at all.
Mhm.

Yes?
I saw the sign.
is the room still for rent?
.
We put the sign up a
quarter of an hour ago.
.
Does that mean "yes?

Please
Mrs. Seeband? 
Yes?
.
There is an interested party.
That was fast.
.





Barnert, Kurt.
What do you do for a living?
Ahm, I'm a student.
.
For fashion.
painting. 
painting?
.
Mrs. Hellthaler!
Carl, here's a tenant for
one of the rooms, come down here.
.

You have facial...  Facial nerve palsy.
partial facial palsy.
the drooping corner of your mouth.
did you ever have an accident?
or a Lyme disease?
.
Take him to the office,
then my husband can talk to him.
.
my husband is a passionate doctor
you can get a free diagnosis.
You should get that checked out.
Kurt comes with
the best recommendations.
.
he is a student, non-smoker.
and we have already
agreed on the rent.
.
it is of course your decision
whether he gets the room.
.
He wants to be a painter.
I am a painter.
.
Our facade is starting to flake off.
maybe we can arrange something.
.
I'm not the kind of painter.
What kind are you?
Picture Painter.
Socialist Realism?
.
Is there anything else?
I hope not.
You get guest room "tandem".
Thank you, Mr. Seeband.
Professor Seeband, please.
.
Nice suit.



Shh.

Shh.

What are you up to?
I was ... out.
Drinking?
That can not help your work.
See that you go to Bed.


I do not like this Kurt.
we have to see that Ellie
doesn't get too friendly with him.
.
Why?
so that she can make a good
match, of course.
.
just like you did.


Professor Seeband, last night...
.. I will of course nobody...
.
You have a new subject.
Me.
for the Directors Gallery.
in this style.
we start tomorrow at 6am in
my office at the clinic, ok?
.
(Radio announcer) Since the people
of the GDR want the unity of Germany,
.
Minister-President Grotewohl
asked the Bonn government...
.
The professor is coming soon.
have a seat.
.
to make all-German elections, all-German,
these suggestions were
made by the Western powers
.
and the Adenauer government
rejected it in compliance with their war policy.
in further compliance with their war policy
the Bonn government and
the Western occupation forces
.
at 4am at the demarcation line...
.. introduced a strict border service in
order to differentiate itself from the GDR
.
and thereby the division of Germany...

Thank you, gentlemen, good day.
.
(radio)... to delineate...
- Kurt.
.
I thought,
you could put your easel...
.
here.
.. the lack of adequate
protection of the GDR
.
is exploited by the Western powers to
 ever greater extent
to send spies,terrorists and 
smugglers into our area.
.
These have after execution of
their Criminal task,
.
so far, have made the possibility of
returning unhindered over the
demarcation line to West Germany impossible
.
that's why we see ourselves
forced to take action for
.
the defense of the peaceful
interests of the population,
.
of the German
Democratic Republic.
.
these measures were entrusted to
the Ministry of State Security.
.


This is what I had in mind.
Very good.
.
tomorrow at 6am we start again.
two sessions should be enough, yes?

Why are you looking
at those old photos again?
.
Why does even the stupidest amateur
photo have more reality than my painting?
.
Dad likes them.
Yes, that's just it.
.
Almost nobody likes a picture of themselves.
but everyone should like a painting.
since the photo must be true.
why did your father
go to Chemnitz?
.
he was already a director here before.
- Hm?
- He does not want us talking about it.
.
he treated the women
of Goring and Goebbels.
.
because he's the best gynecologist.
they traveled 200
kilometers from Berlin.
.
as if there is no one else
Mastering a Cell Smear..
.
can you imagine that.
and they then made him an
honorary member of the SS.
.
he could not refuse.
after the War it was
hard to convey to the Russians,
.
that he had nothing else
to do with the Nazis.
.
they scoured all the archives,
but found nothing against him.
.
The professor today called me
an artist "Type Willi Sitte".
.
but that's good.
he is successful.
.
"Type Willi Sitte"?
I think we have to get out of here.
where to?
you do not mean that seriously.
everything is going so well for us.
I could not abandon Mommy.
Kurt! your diploma thesis
convinced the delegation.
.
they have chosen you to paint the wall
fresco for the new History Museum.
.
Theme: Unity of the working class.
some professors
also liked your work.
.
Mural painting?
I am not a muralist.
Kurt,
we both know you can do that.
.
Nah, I'm sorry,
that's not for me.
.
that is pure decoration.
you have work in one fell swoop.
even money.
.
That's not me.
I I I.

No, do not move,  please.
so I can imagine
that we are one body.
.
I'm pregnant.
then you are now completely mine.
all to me, I mean.
we have to tell them, Ellie.
maybe first of all,
the fact that we are together,
.
break up the shock in small amounts.
I think your mother already suspects something.
It's not mom that worries me.
Dad will fall from every cloud.
for him I will always
be twelve years old.
.


I think Ellie is pregnant.
What?
her temperature has been
slightly elevated for weeks,
.
but no cold symptoms.
she went out twice during
dinner yesterday,
.
she did not touch her
oatmeal at breakfast
.
and held onto the back of
the chair when she got up.
.
third month, I would say.
maybe even fourth.
Oh God, she is still a child herself.
her age is not the
problem, it's the man.
.
but who is it?
a leptosome, melancholiac.
son of a man who kills himself
because he had to clean a few stairs.
.
his dad had something
called like "Hegeabschuss".
.
this is not the genetic material
that I wish for our descendants.
.
we have to stop it.
and how?
after 30 years in
gynecology I know:
.
an abortion can put an end
to almost any love affair.
.


No, I do not know him either,
what is the difference?
.
The psychotic thinks that
two plus two are five.
.
While the neurotic already
knows that it is four,
.
it just worries him.

There is something we want to tell you.
About your academy?
I am always very interested in that.
.
No.  Although... it's also about the academy.
Kurt was commissioned with the wall
painting at the History Museum.
.
Walls after all.
it is a fresco on
working class unity.
.
yes, and speaking of unity...
What is it, child?
nothing unpleasant, I hope.
save my nerves.
We...
we are together.
you also work on the fresco?
we are a couple.
already for some time.
.
a couple of students?
a loving couple.
.. and there's something else...
That's big news.
yes, but there is one more thing that we...
My God,
I have to digest that first.
.

This is really very sudden.
Please,
Bring the Professor water
.
thank you very much.  
thank you.
.


I'm glad you told us.
and you told us early.
there is something about
Ellie that you need to know.
.
we did not want to worry
Ellie unnecessarily
.
that's why we've never
really explained it, but...
.
as an infant Ellie had a severe
discharge in the pelvic cavity,
.
and scar tissue in the fallopian tubes
and thus led to considerable cilia damage.
Cilia ?
the cilia of the
fallopian tubes,
.
they transport the fertilized
egg to the uterus.
.
We are currently looking
for a way
.
to remedy this surgically.
but if she...
became pregnant...
there would be the chance of an
extrauterine pregnancy,
.
an ectopic pregnancy,
an oviduct pregnancy,
which in turn could lead to
severe internal bleeding.
.
so I have to warn you.
for reasons other, than a father
of daughters warn a young man,
.
to not get intimate with
her until we can fix that.
.
a pregnancy at the present time
could be life threatening for Ellie.

You understood me?  
Life-threatening.
.
And if she was already pregnant?
Then I must examine her immediately.


I have to act immediately.
The pregnancy is more
advanced than I feared.
.
it is already the third month.
An abortion?
If I do not remove the fetus immediately,
she will not survive the pregnancy.
.
Here?
we have a reputation to uphold.
Is it really the only way?  Really?
do you doubt my expertise?
I'd expect myself to do that,
for my daughter,
.
if it wasn't necessary?





He had his SS uniform tailor made.
he spent hours posing in it.
in front of the mirror.
.
until he knew how he looked good in it.
it was then that I saw him.
it made no difference to him that I saw him.

on his hat there was a skull.
Silver.
a skull.
a doctor should heal.
he should heal.
will I always be at his mercy?

a gifted doctor, a humanist,
a co-designer of our
socialist republic,
.
in short a role model for
all members of his guild,
.
that's why, on this December 11th,
the day of the health service of the GDR,
.
with the Robert Koch Medal and the
title "Honored Doctor of the People"
.
we award...

Thank you, Comrade Minister,
for the kind words,
.
which I do not deserve.
as a doctor and member of
society, I only do my duty.
.
I am a wheel in the big transmission
of the socialist world movement.
.
just like the painter of this
too too flattering portrait of me
.
only a small wheel,
indistinguishable in style
from the other painters here.
.
as we are all only small
wheels of a big apparatus,
.
who with the help of the Soviet Union
are heading for a great, common goal.
.
Communism.
Thank you.



What did he want?
I'm supposed to go to
KGB headquarters tomorrow.
.
he did not say more.

The plan did not work out.
they are closer than before.
.
patience, Martha.
have patience.


- General Murayov,
- Professor Seeband.
.
.
.
You can go.
.
.
.

Carl.
Carl.
wait, I have to show you something.
come sit down.
Carl, I'm being transferred,
back to Moscow. I will not be
able to protect you anymore.
.
all the others have been caught.
the search for Burghard Kroll and the...
"Physician Coordinator of the Dresden
Region in the Implementation of Euthanasia"
.
is still open on the books.
I can not guarantee,
that my successor does
not come with new investigations
.
starting with doctors and nurses.
you have to leave the GDR
and never come back.
.
make an exit request
for you and your wife.
.
you will be approved.
the truth is they will not
suspect you in the West.
.
at least we hope not.

Carl,
can you tell me something about Kroll?
where he is?
who else was present
at your meetings?
.
you would help me very much.
I never met this man.
I do not know anything about him.
we will not meet
again, my friend.
.
I hope my debt is paid.

You can go.
.
.

- Dear Ellie, 
- Dear Kurt.
.
you've been my son-in-law
for two hours now.
.
I leave my daughter in your care,
when we leave the GDR
at the end of the month.
.
only one thing I could give
you for your life on the way.
.
it is not enough to be good.
I experienced it with
men who were only good,
.
overrun, expropriated,
even eliminated.
.
if you want to have
security in your life,
.
no matter what you do,
you have to be the best.
not one of the best.
THE BEST.
To the married couple.
Cheers.
To a happy life.
.
Cheers
" I am now in Oldenburg,
in the Sanderbusch
Clinic, with the prospect

after Erkner's retirement in two

he fell on his feet
again, it seems.
.





How much would you pay
me for the Wartburg (car)?
.
Are you still in dreamland?
do you know how long a normal
mortal waits for such a car?
.
I do not enjoy it anymore.
300 marks?
Kurt, in the west,
they do not paint anymore.
.
painting is considered bourgeois.
Bourgeois means good for
them, I thought.
.
Oh, what do I know.
of course we all want to
get rid of you here, but...
.
you have a life here.
you have money,  you are just becoming famous.
I mean, I can get girls to bed, 
because I'm your assistant.
.
you can use the
machine like no one else.
.
you'll be 30 next year.
it's not that young anymore.
.
you're...
Why?
Because it's not about all this.
What is it then?
.
the truth.
and who says what is true?
I I I.
- 260 marks? 
- ok, sold.
.
Do you need canvas?
Do you have any?
.
as many as pictures,  in the studio.
What?
paint them over, please, all of them.
I don't want to see them anymore.
.
believe me, it's all wrong,
what I painted there.
.


and the murals?
you can not destroy them.
.


Others will do that for me.



(Policeman) Stop!  Stand still!
- What do you have in the suitcase?
- Things that belong to my brother-in-law.
.
(Announcement) The train is in service travel
direction Zooogischer Garten.
.


It's almost too easy.
Not for long.
.
(Announcement) Next stop:
Zoologischer Garten.
.

Your names? 
Barnert, Kurt.
.
fill this out, please.
your beds are there.  I'll come to you.
Mrs. Muller?  Mrs. Muller!

Thank you, 
Good afternoon.
.
Please.
Thank you.
.


Dear Professor.
if you read these lines
lines, I am in the West.
.
I could not talk to you before,
they would have made me liable for prosecution..
.
you were always very good to me.
that's why you might
even believe me
.
that I did not make
this decision lightly.
.



Mmm?
Hello, I'm Kurt.
should I come back later?
Nah, come in.
.
Klaus, be still, ok?
or you'll mess up your dads.
birthday present for your mother
.


- How old are you? 
- 29.
- I'm turning 30.
- You look younger.
well, Munich is a good idea.
here people have money.
.
they constantly need
portraits and landscapes.
.
in Hamburg, too.  That's... well.
what I would advise against is Dusseldorf.
Dusseldorf? 
Mm.
.
only modern art You
know, avant-garde.
.
if you were not at the academy,
you have no chance there anyway.
.
this is a bit like a mafia.
Munchen is good.
.
Hamburg is good.
and Berlin is so middle class.
well, you can see yourself.
Klaus, keep still.

Good afternoon. I'm Kurt.Barnert. 
Mhm.
.
I called, because of a guided tour.


He hit him in the lecture
and gave him a bloody nose.
.
He showed Hitler's greeting and
then said that it was a provocation.
.
Tasteless.
9000 marks paid for some earth.
No!
.
You're under 26, right?
good, and what do you want to do?
Action?  Installation?  Sculpture?
- Painting actually.
- Painting?
.
no offense, i'm not a bad guy.
from the East. Mecklenburg.
.
Harry, Harry Preusser. 
Kurt.
.
so nobody really does paint anymore.
people want something new.  An idea.


- An idea?
- Yeah, but not like that.
.
something new.  Or at least repackaged.
like Yves Klein, who says,
"I'm claiming ultramarine for me".
I even paint with it.
it's called Yves Little Blue now.
I only paint myself out in it.
.
I paint the bare breasts of
a beautiful woman with it.
.
and she smears her breasts on the breasts
of another beautiful woman.
.
I paint sponge with it
and stick it on canvas. "
.


does not help if someone
had the idea before.
.
Lucio Fontana has been
slitting canvas for six years.
.
but Katrin has nice solid
breasts, and so we leave her.
.

let's divert our
focus away from the obvious,
.
towards the threadbare.
.
let's leave the background behind.
This is Adrian Schimmel.
the name says it already.
his name is actually Adrian Finck,
son of the Mannesmann board.
.
a snob.
And he can talk, that is also clear.
.
but is the idea enough?
in other words, what does the
entire composition tell you?
.
Yes, I think that's pretty.
Well, of course that's a
wallpaper, of course.
.
Excuse me. 
Yes.
.
Yes.
but you see: only seemingly.
that's what we artists are looking for.
that which hides
behind the decorative.
.
look: the emptiness,
printed by the white,
.
that I put between the templates.
.
the banality,
embodied by the recurring pattern.
.
and the senseless brightness
of the neon colors.
.
that's what brought you here.
you have an artistic trance.
Otherwise you did not land here.
your friends see a pretty wallpaper.
.
you see the plane behind it.
Nice.
and...
can you buy something like that?
One can.
that's the big thing about art.
.
the devil always shits on the...
Well, you know.
.
but that is not the way an artist
should speak about his work.
.
he wants to prove to
his successful family
.
that he can succeed without them.
they only pay cabbage
I want to prove to my
unsuccessful family
.
that I can still be successful
it's all cabbage, too.
everything sucks with the families.
.
you can be a maximum of 26, if you
have the idea, otherwise it's nothing.
.
Why? 
Think about it.
.
Picasso was 26 at the
"Demoiselles d'Avignon".
.
Duchamp was 25 when he painted
"Act, descending a staircase".
.
And Michelangelo was 24 at the Pieté.
Goodbye. 
Goodbye.
.
What do you call that?
"potato pendulum".
.
No more points?
I'm interested in potatoes right now.
.
this is Kurt, also comes from the East.
he will study here.
.
ah, then surely you had to listen
to Harry's speech about the idea.
.
you do not believe?
I am more interested...
in potatoes.
come on, before you get corrupted.
Arendt Ivo.
no one knows what he wants.
.
he had everything before
in such large,
same-colored points on plates.
.
he had a real idea.
and now that.
.
then in two months,
he does something completely different.
.
Our professor.
Antonius van Verten,
you probably heard of him in Saxony.
.
an original.
he prefers "myth".
he always wears this hat.
once a student seduced him
just to see him without a hat.
he kept it in bed too.
He works only with felt and fat,
and why?
.
that remains his mysterious secret.
we have to go to all his lectures,
but he never looks at us.
.
he says you can only know for
yourself if you do it right.
.
I think he just does not care.
well, he has us too.
whether you are admitted,
or you get a studio...
.
all the decision of this spinner.
come on.
it's not that interesting.
.
You have not submitted a portfolio.
I could not take anything with me.
and what have you done so far?
painted.
in the DDR? 
Yes.
.
Socialist Realism.
now they have
actually built a wall.
.
did you see that coming?
"Nobody has the intention" 
usually means that exactly the opposite is true.
.
but somehow that's art
again, this wall.
.
a landscape artwork.
the craftsmanship
execution is uninteresting.
.
hundreds of thousands
have difficulties with it.
.
consistent German madness.
what do you like about art?
you do not like talking about yourself, huh?
but your eyes tell me that you
have seen more than all of us.
.

the only two conditions for
you as for everyone else are,
.
first,
that you come to the lectures
.
and secondly never ask
that I look at
something you're doing
.
agreed?
whether it's good for you or
not, only you know that anyway.
.

Hm.
One step forward,
two steps back.
.
oh, come on.
do not say that you can not
do anything you want here.
.
yes, if only I knew what it is.
SPD?
CDU?
Who are you going to vote for?
CDU!
.
FDP!
Peace Union!
These are criminals.
as if they were better!
SPD!
.
Do not vote.
never again choose a party.
choose the art.
it is an either - or.
only in art is freedom
not an illusion.
.
only the artist can make a man
after this catastrophe
.
to return the trace of their freedom.
everybody, whether he is
at the garbage collection
.
or farmer is,
has the chance to be an artist.
if he has his own
subjective skills
.
unfolded without specifications.
if you did not say free,
completely free,
he will be nobody.
by freeing yourself,
you make the world free.
you said priest.
your said Revolutionére.
you said liberator.
bring your burnt offerings.




just say it,
you went under the slasher.
.
that's almost an idea.
you learn quickly.




I've lost it.


I was at the doctor.
I will not be able to have children.
and do you know what he said?
it was the abortion.
no cilia damage.
the holding apparatus is damaged.
Cervical insufficiency.
we will never come
to the third month.
.
because...
because he wanted to keep me so pure...
he has erased his own bloodline.
we will not have children, Kurt.

your pictures.
your pictures will be our
children, yes?
.
good.



Yes...
last time,
we discussed the extension...
.
Ah...
No..  No.. No..
Ah...
did you all read Lehmbruck
you can see this better with the Episkop.
yes, Lehmbruck.
he says:
"Every work of art must have something
of the first days of humanity."
.
So...
as if it had just been divine.
as if it were creeping now...
out of the original mass, out of the rib.
No.
no, no, different, ah...
has anyone of you had
any insight this week?
.
an insight...
you would like to share with us?
Lotto numbers. 
no, really,  the lottery numbers.
if I now give you six
random numbers...
.
5, 7, 23, 19, 44, 11...
... then that's stupid.
.
but when I read the winning
numbers of the lottery draw...
.
may I, please?
2, 17,19,
25, 45, 48 
yes, then somehow they have something
true, compelling, um...
.
yes, almost.... beautiful

Yes.
that was my...
my insight.
You can go home.
I have nothing for you today.
.
Kurt, will you come here please?
Yes?
I want to see your art.
When?
whenever you feel right.
if you are ok with it.
.
just let me know.

why are you considering this at all?
if he likes your work,
you get a gallery.
.
then your girlfriend gets a car.
I'm married.
.
then your wife and
girlfriend will get a car.
.
I just do not know if it's good
enough, what I'm doing here.
.
it's not like that somehow.
that's all subjective, if it was not
subjective, it would be handicraft.
.
it's about luck, you know?
and that he cares
about your stuff,
.
whatever, your luck is.
he does not want to be wrong.
he just wants to see something
genius about your work.
.
do not stand in your own way.
they are good, the works, really.
they are good.


In the war I was a radio operator 
with the Luftwaffe.
.
I was a miserable radio operator.
and my pilot was a lousy pilot.
we had four weeks of training.
.
on our second mission we were shot
down, over the Crimea.
.
the pilot was killed instantly.



I was pulled from the wreck by Crimean Tatars
with burns that I should have died of.
the farmers,
the farmers that
I had just bombed,
.
pulled me out of the wreck...
and nursed me with
what they had.
.

they rubbed my wounds with fat...
and wrapped me in felt blankets.

I stayed with them for a year.
after that, I surrendered
to American captivity.
.
if I ask myself
what I really know,
.
what I really felt in life,
what I can say without reservation...
then it's the fat on my skin.
the home of fat and felt.
when others tell me about love,
to women, to their children,
or sex, then I know what they mean...
I just know I've felt,
felt and fat on my skin.
.
I have not experienced anything before.
my childhood was happy and gentle.
a few slaps, few.
.
my teachers liked me.
I wanted to be a
merchant, like my father.
.
I had no artistic talent.
and I have not experienced anything since.
I stayed happy.
I spent the end of the war
in a hospital with
friendly nurses.
.
very friendly.
after that quite fast success
and this professorship here.
.

but...
the fat and the felt...
I've understood that,
I understood that, as...
how Descartes understood
that he exists.
.
"So I think I am."
he had everything to worry about. everything.
everything could be illusion,
imagination.
.
but then he knew that something
was going on with these thoughts.
.
and that consequently
something has to exist.
.
and this something, that's what he calls ..
"I".
but who are you?
what are you?
this......
you are not.





How was your day?
Productive.


Villa Cimbrone.
Also Villa Cimbrone.
No, Villa Rufolo.
.
But also in Ravello.
Oh, the nice car.
The hotel.
Le Sirenuse.
.
Oh, God, Pompeii.



Still studying at the age of 30?
(Ellie) I'll finish them.
When I was 30,
I was a senior physician in Dresden.
.
When Mozart was 30...
he was dead.
(Ellie) I'll take it out.
Should I open the red wine?
.
I understand that
you did not want support.
.
and that is praiseworthy.
I'll offer you a suggestion.
I know the director of the
Gynecological Clinic Dusseldorf.
.
I am always invited to do
consultations there.
.
I'll get you a
part-time job with them.
.
something suitable.
maybe three hours early in the morning, ok?
Yes
then you will have a income
and still have enough time to...
to paint.
Can not he
just leave us alone?
.
Just disappear from our lives?
maybe the job at the
clinic will help.
.


Kurt Barnert, I come on the
recommendation of Professor Seeband.
.




white on a white background.
is this the new art?
.
"The symbol of emptiness."
that's what you can call it.
.
maybe it will be a sensation.
Come on, I invite you to dinner.
my driver is waiting outside.
.

This must be taken to
Bonn to the authorities.
.
so I get my permanent passport.
it is there ready for pickup.
here is the power of attorney.
.
I thought since you live near Bonn,
you could do it for me?
.
then you can earn extra money.
I'll come back next week
to pick up the passport, yes?
.
Mhm.
Professor, a coffee?
Yes, thank you.
.

Burghard Kroll caught!
Sick Murderer lived for ten years.
unharmed in Schleswig-Holstein!
.

Ten pfennigs.
Thank you.
Sick Murderer ..
No, thank you.
(Newsboy) Sick Murderer.
Ten pfennigs.
.
Thank you, goodbye.
Ciao.
.
Professor, a coffee.
Thank you.
.


You smoke?
63 is an age at which I can start to,
.
the consequences will not
catch up with me.
.
Enjoy your meal.
unfortunately, I have to leave.
.
Say hello to Ellie.
Good night.
Good night, Professor.
.


May I ?
You can take it with you.
I only need the sports section.
.
Thank you.
.
"White on white".
"symbol of emptiness".
your father-in-law?
such an asshole.
you know, for the first time, I wish
success to you more than to myself.
.
your mistake is that you are still
holding on to the canvas and easel.
.
painting is just dead.
such as...
folk dance or silent film.
I only mean you well,
I want you to stop running like this.
.
we can
not be doctors anymore.
.
























Hello. 
Hello.
.
What's this?
I do not know either,
but I think that's its....
.
photos to be painted?
Yes.
.
Excuse me.










I'm satisfied with the
progress of the construction.
.
That's what we
hear, Professor.
.
You know my concerns.
Yes.
.
the total width of the operating room
room door has to be clear on both sides
.
extended it by 25 centimeters.
.
so we can pass easily with beds.
That's right, Professor.
thank you for the suggestion.
.
Has Dr. Weber called?


You understand, I believe,
why I did not introduce you this morning.
.
it would have been inappropriate.
well, what does art do? and more
importantly, do you have my passport?
.






I...
I have to go... unfortunately.
Thank you.
sorry.

Have you ever seen anything like this?
what did you tell him?  
why did he leave?
.



















If you knew what you
look like now.
.
I'm pregnant.
fourth month.
I was at the doctor.  
we will be parents.
.
we will be parents.



it's Sunday, no one is here.
I promise you.
.
please, there is nobody here.
.
please, like yesterday.
.
please tell me again,
and then come down.
.

I am pregnant.

These are not potatoes, eh?
What do you think if I
become your gallery owner?
.
Adrian Schimmel, the gallery owner?
Adrian Finck.



With such exhibitions,
I try to set a backlight.
.
I'm glad you're here.
Thank you.
.
We should start.
are there any questions
for Kurt Barnert right now?
.
maybe then I will ask
the first question.
.
Mr. Barnert,
many of your pictures are painted
from amateur fotos or illustrated.
.
the picture "Act on a staircase", ..
that's a tribute to Duchamp?
Yes.

Heinz Viersen, West German newspaper.
Mr. Barnert,
in your magnificent painting "Mother
and Child", which we see here...
.
who is represented?  your mother and you?
No, that's just an amateur foto.
I do not really care about who I paint.
but if you paint a portrait,
then you need to know the person.
.
it's even better if
I do not know them.
.
then I can better see what's really there.
also the picture with the
passport photos from the machine?
.
a photo without an author?
Yes.
with the Wehrmacht officer
do you make any statement
about the Wehrmacht?
.
No, I do not make statements.
I'm doing, um...
.
Images.
so, photos... Photos by other means.
Hermann Schreiber, SDR.
they also take on the exact
composition of the amateur photo.
.
there is a lot of coincidence.
No, not coincidentally.  Hmm...
reality, harmonious, genuine
only reality is coherent.
every reality is coherent.
.
everything that's true is already true.
(Viersen) What do you mean?
Hm...
if I now name six numbers,
then that's stupid, meaningless.
if the six numbers are
the winning numbers from the lottery
draw, then you have the sense,
.
a coherence, a value,
yes, almost a beauty.
.
that's the same with the photos.
I want the truth.
look.



Yes, Mr. Meybert?
Urs Meybert, art chronicle.
what's next for you?
still blurred painted pictures?
.
no, I have enough of that now.
.
I am currently interested
in color plates.
.
(Meybert) Color plates?
Yes.
(Cameraman) We're going to get into trouble.
still we get in trouble.
Randomly chosen illustrated pictures,
passport photos of the machine,
.
and snapshots from
family albums.
.
everything is out of focus.
with such pictures,
that have a real power
for unknowable reasons,
.
Kurt Barnert seems
to be the leading
artist of his generation.
.
and that with the dead-crazy painting.
but...
how many in his generation has
nothing to tell, nothing to say.
.
he breaks away from any tradition,
says goodbye to the
biographical approach in art
.
and thus creates for the
first time in art history
.
a work without an author.
Was that good?
That was great.
.


Are you sure, I can not drive you?
I'd like to walk a bit.
you were good today.
that was good.
this is going to be good.







(Bus driver, over loudspeaker) 
     On three.
.
One,
Two,
Three.
