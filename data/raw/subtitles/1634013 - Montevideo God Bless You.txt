The story goes...
Whoever manages to
juggle a raw egg... dies.
But he will also become
immortal and a legend.
God gave me everything.
I had my Mom...
My hardworking hands...
And one healthy leg.
What more do you need in life?
It was when I started
to like football,
That I realized
people sometimes need both legs.
When my Mom got sick, she said,
son, you must be strong,
it doesn't matter how you are born,
but how you live
and if you know how to dream.
There was nothing hinting
that 1 930,
would be the year
when a dream was born.
But that's life, I guess.
You'd think
there'd be some order in life,
but sometimes, you experience the very
best of it while you're still a kid.
It was the first decade
of peace after the Great War,
that's what we called it,
it was the biggest one until then.
Belgrade was still recovering
from the years of war.
People were pulling down the old
in order to make room for the new,
believing, as they always do,
that there would be no more war.
MONTEVIDEO
Taste of a Dream
What's this?
I could've done this myself.
Bang, slam!
Couldn't this be done
a little differently?.
-Differently, how?.
-Now what?.
What am I supposed to do
with the bricks!
A new house, new material.
Concrete.
Shoe-shining, sir?.
Easy...
Aleksandar Tirnanic, Tirke.
The best player I knew.
Until that day,
I was the only who knew that.
Ever since
I was left alone in the world,
he was my guardian,
and my only true friend.
Tirke!
Easy, neighbor,
you 're scaring my customers away!
Tirke, don't ask for trouble,
I'll tell your mother, I swear.
-Go play with that ball in a field!
-I'm not going to no field!
Take me to the BSC
(Belgrade Sport Club)!
Master Rajko was a good
man with a good reputation.
Listen you rascal,
do you know what the BSC is?.
He was a big supporter of the BSC.
BSC is the greatest club
in this country.
Holy smoke!
Yeah, if it weren't for FC
Yugoslavia...
Don't listen to
Rajko's baloney, Tirke.
Get a job first,
Make your mother happy.
Then I'll get you into the
'Yugoslavia'.
From 'Great Serbia'
to 'Yugoslavia', overnight.
Traitors.
Shame on you, lying to kids...
Barber Bogdan loved everything
that was new and trendy,
guess that's why he was
a big fan of FC Yugoslavia.
Football was just starting
to be fashionable,
and fashion is a risky thing
for us Serbs.
Not because we like fashion,
but because we like to fight.
Tirke was like a son
to both of them.
Serves you right!
Old men, been through
the Great War together,
fighting over a children's game!
Tirke's dad was in the war as well.
But he didn't survive it,
He died in his best friends' arms.
This boy has yet
to give us trouble...
Hey, what does that guy do?.
He's a master.
-A master of what?.
-A master of football.
I'll take the ball away!
Go find a field!
I'll go to Hungary to play football,
and you can stay here in the dark.
-No, no, no!
-No, don't!
Let's have a drink.
Stanislav,
get the electrician.
Give him this.
Tell him to come
to the BSC stadium at noon.
Sir, what about the other shoe?.
Good news, gentlemen.
Great news.
Does that mean FIFA
decided to support the Serbs
in the football war
against the Croats?.
Jules Rimet and FIFA made
a historical decision.
Sorry I'm late.
The first football world cup
will be organized soon.
World Cup?.
What do football clubs get from that?.
Football will get a lot from that,
gentlemen. Right, Mr. President?.
The Croats won't send their best
players during the championship.
I'm only just beginning to
cope with the FC 'Yugoslavia'.
Football history
is being written in Uruguay.
That's at the end of the world,
who'll go there?.
-We are.
-Us?.
Jules Rimet is counting on us.
You can count on us Serbs for each new
and foolish thing that comes up.
Football was still young.
Back then, it wasn't the rich
running on the pitch,
watched by us poor folk,
but the other way round.
I'll skip practice today.
Look at all this work.
This is a prison.
-I think it's time for some action.
-What action, Milutinac?.
Organized action,
individuals can't do anything alone.
Watch out.
We'll be organized
in beating the BSC on Sunday.
I mean real action, for God's sake.
What are we waiting for?.
Mulutinac, communism is
beyond the law, get it?.
-But not beyond reason!
-Ok, what do you suggest?.
Plotting against the state again?.
I'm not plotting.
-How did you know I was here?.
-Get in. I'm taking you to town.
Off for some action without us,
Milutin?.
We'll talk.
Kid, is he going to be there?.
Don't know, he didn't pay me
for that one shoe yet.
-Can I come to the BSC with you?.
-Quiet!
-Can I come to the BSC with you?.
-Quiet!
Mother,
do you have the water for luck?.
I've flung water after you many
times but it never brought good luck.
Come on,
try and get the job.
-It's a good factory, good wages.
Yeah, working only ten hours a day.
Let me see...
Good as new.
BELGRADE SPORT CLUB -the BSC
Mosha Marjanovic.
Holy moly, it's Mosha!
He was great even
when football was small.
Rumor had it, he got paid
one hundred dinars for every goal,
but they also say
that he was always in debt.
We'll play against
'Gradjanski', 'Hajduk'.
We haven't scored a single goal
in the last 3 matches.
-I told the players.
-Why didn't you offer them a bonus?.
Where from, did you bring the money?.
Sorry, that's the reason why I called
the boy to come in for a trial.
Boza, a trial right before the derby?.
Who does that?.
Yes.
Come in, Tirke, go on.
Hello.
Bozha the engineer invited me.
That's Tirke, I called him in.
Bozha, is the other one here
for a trial as well?.
-No, that's Stanoje, he's...
-I'm the lucky charm.
Ah, the lucky charm.
Young man, do you play football?.
-I do.
-Where do you play?.
In my street, in my neighborhood.
-Which club, I mean...
-...apart from your neigbourhood.
Bozha, where did you see
the young man play football?.
In the street.
In the street?.
Let's not waste time,
get him to come after the derby.
Go to the youth sports' club.
Bozha, we run a serious club here.
You think so, Bozha?.
I think so.
-Bozha the Dunce is thinking.
-Zivkovic....
You got your gear, young man?.
-We do.
Fine.
I'll give you five minutes.
You should leave football.
It takes up too much of your time.
I'll graduate, and you'll still be
in the third year. Then what?.
Us defensive players
are a little slow.
-You really mean it?.
-I do, yes.
Maybe you're right.
I'll play just this last derby.
Only kings are free in Serbia!
Look at this, you're going
to the world championship.
What are you talking about?.
There, it says here,
Montevideo, holy smoke!
They say
those South American girls are...
Hey, let's go eat.
Aca, son, wait for me here, please.
Boys, this is Tirnanic
from the neighborhood.
He's a good boy, we've heard many
nice things about him.
He's come here for a try-out.
Go on, Tirnanic, join in.
Ballerina, coming in the middle
of practice again?.
I wish I were just an apprentice or
a student, like most guys here.
Change and get in there, go on.
My boss doesn't let me go to
either exams or training.
The bastard doesn't give a damn
about university and football.
What's your position, pal?.
Right-winger.
Right-winger, you're kidding!
Mosha, start looking for a new club.
Or move to the left wing?.
You could be a midfielder too.
Tough kid.
Let's play some ball,
see what you can do.
Who's a dunce now?.
What's the matter,
anyone going to guard me?.
Vampire, cover him!
Be gentle, Vampire!
Am I not always?.
What's that, holy smoke?.
Now the left... and the heel.
You think you'll get in the BSC
by shaming the other players?.
That's not the way to do it, kid.
What do you make of the guy, Mosha?.
He's good for a right-winger,
but that position's already taken.
Tirke, you were great,
they'll take you, you'll see.
Shut up, it's good they
didn't beat me up.
A factory's the only place for me.
Yeah, so you screw up your entire
life.
You're not for a factory, Tirke!
You're not!
Most players are sparrows.
Only the great ones are pigeons.
A pigeon flies alone.
Honestly, Tirke, I doubt it.
Zivkovic is against it
and so is the rest of the team.
Mosha left without a word,
you saw it yourself.
All right, Radoje.
Radoje really likes football.
Fine, Radoje, we'll do that later.
Tirke will think I'm nuts.
Maybe you should ask Andrejevic,
he might know something.
What do you think?.
Who cares about the opinion of a man
called Bozha the Dunce?.
His dribbling is good, he shoots well.
-That guy Pirke.
-It's Tirke, from Tirnanic.
He'd be very useful in the derby
against the FC 'Yugoslavia'.
He doesn't know his manners.
-No one cares about his manners.
What if the bastards from
the Yugoslavia get him first?.
Then we're in trouble.
Girls! Nosey, go get some chairs.
-I'm not Nosey, I'm Djokica.
-Whatever.
Hi girls.
I've brought the best of the BSC.
Led by Mosha.
-Good evening.
-Good evening.
-Please, have a seat.
-We're used to something more classy.
-Please, have a seat.
-We're used to something more classy.
I'm fed up with classy places.
And they won't let us in there
anyway.
Girls, how about
I take you out for some fun?.
-Where?.
-I don't know, ladies...
How about the Jockey Club?.
See you around, boys.
But girls, we had a date here!
-Who is this?.
-Rada Pashic, a real son-of-a-bitch.
Son-of-a-bitch or not,
he'll get some tail...
-...and we can talk about football...
-No we won't, let's go.
-Go where, Mosha?.
-You heard the man, Jockey Club.
-That's for gentlemen!
-We'll need some hats then.
There they are.
Bring drinks for the girls
to our table.
-Good evening.
-Good evening.
Aca, son...
It's just a job.
You'll find something.
Your father was a great soldier.
This belongs to you now.
Keep it and be proud of him.
What a nice boy.
Want to try to kick the ball, kid?.
How do you say in your language,
kick the ball?.
Shoot.
Shoot, shoot the ball.
Aca, my son...
-Are you ok?.
-I'm fine, mother.
Hey, neighbor, how are you?.
When will you come visit us?.
-Maybe, some other time.
-What a pity.
What are you doing?.
-Can't sleep.
-Me neither.
Have we met before?.
I know,
your picture's on an ad for soap.
You use soap?.
I use the one with the picture on it.
That's how I know you.
Could you step away for a bit?.
As far as you can.
Allow me...
It's got to be done
a little more gently.
Hey Valeria, let's go play roulette.
In a minute...
Hurry up.
You never told me your name.
Blagoje.
A peasant's name.
Blagoje or Blagoja?.
They call me Mosha, Mosha Marjanovic.
-And you?.
-Valeria.
Just like a soap ad.
Good evening, come in.
Mr. Riboli, glad you could make it,
have a seat.
We were expecting
the head coach as well.
Former head coach, gentlemen.
He asked me
to pass on his letter of resignation.
Ante Pandakovic, former head coach?.
-Is it always this lively here?.
-Yes.
The head office
of the football federation
was illegally moved
from Croatia to Serbia.
Until this is resolved, our boycott
of the national team stays.
That's our official position.
-Is a compromise possible?.
-That's not for me to decide.
But you do have
some influence, right?.
Mr. Riboli, we need five
Croatian players straight away.
As long as the boycott is on,
our players will not take part.
They don't have to play, just have an
audience with the king.
We're raising funds for the world cup.
-I hope we can negotiate that?.
-I don't know, old boy.
We have a saying, don't go to Belgrade
to negotiate. If you have to go...
-Go and party.
-Wisely put and quite true.
One negotiates better
while having a good time.
I mean, when you're relaxed.
I know a place.
Zivkovic...
A footballer, then.
Your legs must be full of bruises.
What do you do?.
I paint and shock the bourgeoisie
whenever I get the chance.
How are you with bruises?.
Should've shown up earlier,
footballer.
These venues have become
boring like hell.
The whole town is dying of boredom.
I've told you before,
don't tell me off.
-Sorry.
-When I put...
Valeria, we'll miss the party.
You go on,
the footballer will give me a lift.
On his back, I presume.
The T-model Ford, the latest one.
The latest...
Bragging about your car is what
a poor man does, remember that.
You're cute.
Blagoje.
What did I tell you, Mr. Riboli!
Fantastic!
-I'm not in an offside position, am I?.
-By no means.
I don't want a referee waving
a flag at me, right?.
I'm the referee here.
Mr. Riboli, we're getting closer
to an agreement, right?.
Mr. Riboli, we're getting closer
to an agreement, right?.
You'll give us five players?.
Mihalic, Kunst, Agic,
Pavelic and Praunsberger.
Cheers, sir.
Cheers.
It's like this every night.
You know, Tirke, I can't sleep from
all this love.
Everyone says love is beautiful, but
no one says there's
so much screaming involved!
That's not love.
-It's not?.
-Nah.
Oh, good.
I've decided I won't have any of it.
And you?.
Have you done it?.
No.
I'm waiting for true love.
So you won't have to pay
like these guys here. That's clever.
-Can I come up?.
-No.
I'm not in the mood tonight.
Good night.
The football scum
hangs out at the Kasina?.
Yes.
Get the boys ready.
Radoje!
Rajko.
I'm looking for Radoje.
Radoje!
-Who's Radoje, is that your son?.
-No, it's a pigeon.
High-flying,
white as snow, a real beauty.
I searched the whole town,
not a hint of him.
-Maybe some cat scared him.
-It happens.
There he is.
Radoje!
-This guy won't get far.
-Come on.
I saw this in a circus once.
He crashed down to the ground
after three steps.
This is the last time
I consent to your methods.
My methods?. You're the one who wanted
to go to the world cup.
With what?.
I have no players.
-We just took care of that!
-I have no money.
-We've never had any money.
-There's no head coach. Nothing!
And on top,
you're making a fool of me here.
You know what your problem is,
Andrejka?.
You want everything to be ideal.
-Is that a bad thing now?.
-Well, nothing is ideal.
You want me to invent
a head coach for you?. Some genius?.
We don't need a genius, we need
something close to that. A lunatic!
Someone with nothing to lose. What we
need is someone who's really lost.
And it won't hurt if he knows
something about football.
But you'll never find that.
Oh, Radoje...
I found him.
Good morning.
Radoje the pigeon,
I trained him myself.
The morning edition of 'Politika'.
Read it here!
Kingdom of Apes in Africa!
Go on, run, run!
Excuse me...
Is this Belgrade?.
-What's wrong with her?.
-Why would anything be wrong?.
Because they sent her to me
to marry her off.
Is she ugly, fat, crazy?.
You're crazy you know!
Clever she's not,
that's your family tradition,
tell me what's wrong with her.
You're breaking my heart.
Here's some ice, master Rajko.
-Who's the barber running away from?.
-Fool!
Bogdan, let the children be,
you're mad anyway.
Teachers are not teaching you well.
Man didn't originate from an ape,
he derives from a bear,
you have a good example there.
You're my friend, but you're
a fool. Djurdja, take this.
I'm not taking anything from you!
It's ice, you crazy woman,
it'll melt!
Rajko, your guest is here.
Here I am, uncle.
Is auntie here?.
-Rosa?.
-Auntie!
What should I do with these things?.
-Whose things?.
-Rosa's.
That's not Rosa.
That can't be her.
People, this can't be serious.
This is a disaster.
We don't have anything,
that's not appropriate!
Not to mention that we don't have
any money for the trip.
We don't have the Croats.
Thanks to Mr. Zivkovic, we'll have
some players from Croatia
at the King's ball with us tomorrow.
That will be the start of our
preparations for the world cup.
Not only that, gentlemen.
He managed to find us a suitable
opponent for the preparations.
Which national team did you
manage to find, Mr. Zivkovic?.
-Which national team?.
-Yes.
The national team of...
-Bulgaria?.
-There, gentlemen.
Mr. President, we can notify
Bulgaria that we accept?.
-Ok, call the Bulgarians.
-Where's our head coach then?.
Suggest something,
we're in a terrible situation.
We've never been worse off.
Gentlemen, we clearly need
someone who'll cost us nothing.
-There is no such thing!
-Get serious, that doesn't exist.
Andrejka, you're out of your mind.
I've never seen you like this.
I'll prove you wrong.
Mr. Boshko, please.
Gentlemen, our new head coach,
engineer Boshko Simonovic.
Good Lord.
Give it here.
Come on, I'm over here!
Come on gimpy, pass us the ball.
Tirke, how are you?.
Show me the trick with your feet?.
Good morning.
Good morning neighbor.
A double shot.
So young, and drinking already.
It's coming.
-Here you are.
-Thank you.
Many important heads
had come to this neighborhood...
But never a foot more important
than the one that came that day.
In brand new Italian shoes.
Go on, polish.
Ok, ok.
Latest Ford model?.
Yes.
What are you doing in my street?.
What's up, dandy boy?.
You did your best to eliminate me?.
Listen kid, I won't pretend to like
you, because I don't.
You think Mosha will punch him?.
-Shut up, you idiot.
If someone plays football like you,
I don't even have to like him.
Are you interested in being
the right-winger of the FC BSC?.
Not sure.
I'm thinking of going
to Hungary to play football.
Hungary, yeah, right.
Haven't considered a French team?.
-I hear they're short of players.
-Not a bad idea.
Listen,
if I didn't have money problems, you'd
still be chasing a rag ball here.
Right-winger.
Take it.
-Could Stanoje help out?.
-Who?.
He's my lucky charm.
Thank God I don't have a steady
girlfriend, you'd want her, too.
So be it!
Can we get something to drink here,
to celebrate?.
I'll do it.
-Mosha, Tirke can do the raw egg.
-He's lying to you, kid.
Only the Hungarian guy
could do that.
But he died right after that.
And that's how
the greatest duo in the history of
Serbian football came to be.
The names of Mosha and Tirke were
always pronounced together,
solemnly somehow, with respect.
-New football boots, Tirke!
-Originals.
-Let me see.
-You 'll see them tomorrow.
Aca, son, come here a bit.
The gentleman came to have a chat with
you. Introduce yourself.
-Mane the tailor.
-Aleksandar.
Sit down.
If you leave the right impression,
the gentleman might hire you.
You'll become a man,
make your mother proud.
That's right.
You could become a good tailor.
But I don't want to be a tailor.
-Aca, son, don't.
-Threads and needles are not for me.
Tirke, is it true what these
scoundrels are saying?.
I can't believe it.
Mosha was here?.
Leave us alone, we have
more important things here.
Mosha is more important.
Is it true or not?.
-Mosha was here, yes.
-Mosha was where?.
-Who's Mosha?.
-Mosha was here, fine.
This gentleman is here,
we're discussing serious matters.
Why didn't you keep him here?.
Did he just turn up?.
-He came to tell me I've been accepted.
-Accepted where?.
-To the BSC.
-Accepted where?.
-What's the BSC?.
-BSC?.
-The juniors?.
-No.
I don't understand what's going on!
-What are you doing at BSC?.
-Where else?.
I'd take him to the FC 'Yugoslavia'.
Soon, he'd be playing the first team.
-What?.
-I'm playing with the BSC on Sunday.
-On Sunday?.
-The derby.
-Shame on you.
-Our Tirke will play in the derby!
The gentleman came here... Shame on you.
You set it up, shame on you too.
Bogdan!
Bogdan, wait, let's have a drink!
It's our Tirke.
Ah the fool. Tirke will play with
the BSC on Sunday, people!
-Well done.
-Well done, Tirke!
Djurdja, give everyone
a drink... Rosa!
I pray to you, god almighty,
who sees and knows everything.
Hear my prayer and let us beat this
BSC tomorrow.
Just so you know, Lord, BSC players
are very ethical and religious people.
If at all possible,
let us beat them 5-0.
They're much greater believers than
this scum from the 'Yugoslavia'.
Therefore, give them strength,
oh Lord, to win tomorrow.
There were a lot of holidays back then:
Union Day, the King's Name Day,
St. Vitus day, Christmas and Easter.
The feast of St. Nicholas
was celebrated the most,
but there was only one feast
for me, a football feast.
The Derby... BSC vs Yugoslavia.
Mother, will you scatter some water
after me for good luck?.
You want to watch the match?.
I have a ticket for you.
Someone has to stay home and work.
God created Sundays for men,
not women.
-Hello, Tirke.
-Hello.
Tirke, score a goal, won't you?.
Make our neighborhood proud!
Good morning, uncle Bogdan.
-Be brave, neighbor.
-Thanks, neighbor.
-Good luck, boy.
-Thanks.
Tirke, come here.
All right, enough.
Turn the radio up so we
don't hear what they're saying.
I was watching you and became
a little sad.
When I went to war,
I had my father.
-To tell me a thing or two.
-I'm not going to war.
It's war alright.
Your father didn't live to see this
day, he died in my arms.
You've already had a drink or two.
-I've been drinking since yesterday.
I'll give you advice my father gave me
when I went to war.
Good morning.
Wait, I've got something for you,
wait here.
-Working hard?.
-A little.
And you?.
Where are you off to this early?.
-To war.
-What war?.
-Will you be sorry if I get killed?.
-No, really, what war?.
Football war, I'm playing for the BSC.
Ever been to a match?.
Would you come, for good luck?.
Rosa, sort this out, go on.
-Listen, we wrote Mosha a letter.
-What letter?.
A love letter.
-I didn't write it.
-Get away!
You'll give it to him.
-He's not married?.
-Not as far as I know.
-There, I'll do it for him.
-But you're already married.
Fool, just you give him this,
it's all written there.
Go on.
Wait,
I didn't give you some fatherly advice.
-Kick their asses.
-Thanks, Rajko.
-Good day, gentlemen.
-Hello, Mosha.
-Ready for a new victory?.
-No, Ballerina is taking a shower.
I'm the only footballer who has
to shower before a game.
-Fucking factory!
-Kid...
What are you?.
A tailor or a footballer?.
I'll know in an hour and a half.
-Is that tweed?.
-It's English.
If I don't score today,
I'll be making those.
If I don't score, I'm bankrupt.
-And if you do score?.
-Then I'll be wearing them.
A ticket.
-Got tickets?.
Yes, chief.
That's it, men, cultured
is the thing. Follow me.
Good day, chief.
All right, let's go.
Rajko, I've been keeping
a seat for you.
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.
Get in already!
Go on!
-Good day, sports officials.
-Commissioner.
-What a pleasant scene, a full stadium.
-Yes, lovely.
The king has prohibited
public gatherings,
so I have to say
I don't like this one bit.
He prohibited political rallies,
this is football.
That's all fine, until they start
chanting against the king and country.
-Here you are.
-What's that?.
-Champagne.
-Take that away, get me a slivovitz.
BSCers, we'll establish
a dictatorship upon you!
Right?.
Our king didn't create it for nothing...
What's with that drink,
Zivkovic?.
Hello?.
Studio, can you hear me?.
I can't hear you, hello!.
God help us.
Hello?.
Studio, can you hear me?.
-We can hear you.
-Oh, so you can hear me.
I can hear you too, very well.
Like on the phone, yes.
Are we starting?.
Oh, we're on the air?.
I didn't know that.
Good afternoon dear listeners.
The players of both teams
are coming onto the pitch
in front of the crowded stadium
of the Belgrade Sport Club.
Tirke, Tirke!
That's my best friend!
I hear you're not
the right-winger today.
No, we have a new one, Tirke.
Fast as lightning.
Welcome to the derby, boy.
Nervous?.
I won't be,
when I slip it between your feet.
-Tough, eh?.
-Tough.
I'll guard him today, as a welcome
gift. You're mine.
You're mine too.
Should we kiss now?.
Too early to start
monkeying around, boy.
Good luck, kid.
Look at Mosha, there.
He's the most handsome, right?.
Others are good-looking too.
Why so rough?.
Go on, play.
Are you sorry
Milutin is leaving football?.
-It's not like I don't care.
-I know, Jaksa, but it's time.
We have to think about the future.
The match is getting heated up.
The 'Yugoslavia' is on the attack,
it's a good chance,
but one of the BSC players, talented,
people say, Tirnanic...
Rajna, come over here, we can listen
to the match together.
I don't have time for that
foolishness.
Come here please!
Here...
Let's listen to it together.
Oh man, you're younger, get up when
you see me coming!
Tirke!
We're following an excellent play
by the Yugoslavia players,
there's a nice chance!
Just over the crossbar.
Let's have some objectivity here,
this was way up in the clouds!
This is the very first
radio broadcasting of a sports event
please have understanding
if there are any difficulties.
The Yugoslavia players' grief for
this missed chance is indeed great.
Let's go, let's go!
Goal!
-Well done, Mosha.
-Well done Tirke, well done Mosha!
Some people play football,
some people score goals.
This is what the defense...
Go fuck a duck!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rajna, I really am.
-Congratulations.
-Mosha, Mosha.
-Was that my Aca who scored?.
-He didn't score, he passed the ball.
Same thing, isn't it?.
Not the same, but never mind.
Ten dinars says,
twice through the feet.
-Now the left...
-Play football, boy.
The heel!
Watch out, first time.
-Holy smoke!
-What are you doing, Ivkovic?.
Milutinac, slap those Commies
of yours, not us.
Calm down, gentlemen!
-This is an outrage.
-What did he do that for?.
Ivkovic, leave the pitch.
Well done, referee!
What's this Tirnanic?. Football is
not a circus, this is a scandal!
-But he slapped him.
-So?. Ivkovic is not just anyone.
He's so wicked.
-What?.
-Oh, nothing.
Arsenijevic, watch Luburic,
he passed you at least ten times.
If we win, we'll play
against the Croats.
-Who's Luburic?.
-He passed you ten times.
We can be the champions of
Yugoslavia, unless this Mundial...
Come on now!
Watch out, no rushing.
Come on, people.
Did you write me a check?.
For the goal?.
A check! Get out of here.
Tirnanic, you stay.
Don't worry sir, we'll score two more.
At least.
What you did to Milutinac shows you're
already a great player,
but not a great man.
Sometimes that's all that counts, son.
Go, play ball.
And remember,
this is a gentlemen's game.
The referee's rash decision has weakened
the 'Yugoslavia team...
Bogdan, can you show me
where the match is?.
Good afternoon, dear listeners.
Here we are at the foot of the ancient
walls of the Belgrade fortress,
that, I am certain, recall even the
arrival of the Roman legions.
Hey, it's not a history lesson...
The Huns, the Avars, the Moors,
the Goths and the Visigoths as well.
All these people came here to watch
my son?. The world's gone mad.
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.
It's here, ma'am.
When did you get here?.
-How could they score a goal on us?.
-Be quiet and sit down.
-Did you hear?.
-What?.
We're in the lead, 1-0.
Did she see?.
Yes.
-And she left?.
-Yes.
I embarrassed both myself and her.
Whilst in the first part of
the game the rays of sunlight
awakened the sweetest
sentiments in men,
the colors of the sky
have become dimmer now.
Move, man.
-The chilly wind from the Danube...
-This isn't the weather forecast!
A goal is hanging in the air.
The chilly wind from the Danube creeps
into the bones of us all.
Kustudic, let me do my commentary
and kindly go fuck yourself.
When a Roman historian was once asked
what the doom of mankind was,
he replied that
the world was one big arena...
-Tirke!
-My poor son, they're massacring him!
-Referee, protecting circus artists?.
-Go over there!
Scumbag, want me to send you
straight back to your mountain?.
Gentlemen! Let's not embarrass
ourselves. Free kick.
It's alright Rajna, he's fine.
They can't let him pass, it's
football, they have to cut him.
Kick, go on, go on, kick!
Goooal!
Well done Tirke!
You're great, Bozha, you're great.
Ah, my dead friend,
if only you could see this.
What's the matter Rajna?.
Neighbor, I don't know
whether to laugh or cry.
He's always been a sad boy, ever since
his father got killed.
And now, look at him.
That's because the goalie
doesn't know shit.
Rajna, it's all right.
What's the matter, referee?.
So, BSC vs Yugoslavia 2-0.
Bora Jovanovic and my colleague
Djordje Kustudic were with you today.
Get the fuck off!
Stay out of it, kid,
I'll show you how it's done.
Pirate, kick this one.
Well, not quite like this.
Fuck this, this is like working three
shifts in a row, not playing football.
This is for you.
-What is it?.
-A letter.
-Not a bill?.
-No, a love letter.
Really?.
It's not scented,
they usually put perfume.
-Who's it from?.
-From Rajko, our local innkeeper.
-Rajko is sending me a love letter?.
-It's his niece, really.
What's she like?.
-She's fine.
-Fine.
Really fine.
She came to Belgrade recently and...
And she's already in love?.
Belgrade is a miracle.
I don't know if she's in love.
-Read the letter.
-I will, later, perhaps.
What?.
Want to come to Rajko's inn
this evening?.
I can't, sorry.
Got a date.
We'll party all night,
I'm bringing the boys.
I'd like to, but I can't.
Women will be the death of me.
Maybe I'll drop by later.
You were good today.
-Bye, guys.
-Bye, Mosha.
She says she doesn't want to see you.
She can tell me that herself.
She told me to tell you she doesn't
want to see you.
-I just want to explain.
-What's to explain?.
She says you embarrassed her
for the rest of her life.
Really, Milutinac, it's a shame.
2-0!
Milutin...
Don't explain anything,
just come in.
Come on, give me the letter back
and take me to this exhibition.
Spectacular, a marriage proposal!
You peasants are so sweet.
-Let's go!
-Where to?.
To get you married, handsome.
-Tomorrow.
-Come on, bridegroom.
-Cheers!
-Cheers!
Ever been to the cinema?.
-Rajko won't let me.
-Rajko?.
I'm in the BSC now.
Rajko would give anything for the BSC,
his house and his inn, all of it.
-Are you talking about Mosha?.
-Him and nothing else, uncle.
You're so naughty!
I'm only like that
because I have to be.
You didn't finish school?.
-What for?. I can play football.
Only football?.
I know my women too.
See, you're really naughty,
if you know everything about women.
I don't know everything.
I've never kissed one.
And you?.
-What?.
-Have you ever kissed someone?.
That's why I thought
we should go to the cinema.
To kiss?.
No, so you can see how to do it.
They do it in the movies, you know.
They close their eyes like this, and then...
Mosha!
I think it's here.
Too bad
I didn't bring my galoshes.
Rosa!
Mosha, this is Rosa,
my niece from the country.
-And you are?.
-I'm Blagoje's chauffeur.
-Go over there.
-He's funny.
Mosha.
Have a seat,
the refreshments are coming.
My uncle keeps talking about you.
He says the number one man of Belgrade
is the King, and then you.
There's just one better than me.
That's Tirnanic.
Cheers, Tirke!
Cheers!
Cheers, boys!
Better than you?.
Blagoje, what's the matter with you?.
He is better.
We're all scoundrels,
and he only pretends to be like us.
He's a pure soul.
Yes, until he runs into temptation.
-He'd resist it.
-Go on, play something.
-No one can resist real temptation.
You don't know him, so shut up.
Maybe I could get to know him better.
Tirnanic, your father was a charger
too, but he was on the right side.
There,
again I thought I was dreaming.
And that it had all come true.
My best friend Tirke played for the BSC,
and even scored the winning goal.
-May I ask for a dance?.
-I don 't know how to.
I'll teach you, it's easy.
But he looked like he was unhappy.
Some women appeared.
Can I ask the lady for a slow dance?.
Get off, moron.
Kid.
Tirke!
Where are you going?.
Thanks for the goal.
Tirke!
Tirke, wait!
What's the rush?.
Is it true what
they say about the raw egg?.
Whoever juggles it dies?.
That's what they say.
Tirke, are we living in vain?.
What do you mean?.
Well, we come and we go.
Our legs hurt and we're never happy.
Why are we living, is it worth it?.
Good night.
I knew quite a bit about life
and everything about football.
It's just these women and this love,
I had no clue about that.
Good morning.
So, is it true what the girl
says, the King and then me?.
You men have such high opinion of
yourselves.
Is that me?.
No.
This is crap.
This is shit, completely amateur.
Didn't you have
a nice time last night?.
Nice?.
Nice is an esthetic category.
There is no such thing as nice sex.
It can be either good or bad!
-I don't talk about love like that.
-You're talking about love...
