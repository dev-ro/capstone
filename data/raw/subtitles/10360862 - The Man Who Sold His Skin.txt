Open the door!
Move!
Let's sit down.
What are you doing?
What is someone knows my family?
What?
Are you angry?
No.
You're right.
The guy visiting you tomorrow,
What does he do?
He works at the Syrian Embassy
in Belgium.
Oh.
In Europe?
Yes.
I'm only meeting him
to make my mother happy.
What about me?
Did you tell your mother about me?
So?
- I'm not good enough?
- Don't say that, Sam.
I...
I love you.
Say it once more.
I love you!
- Then let's get married!
- Now?
Why not?
Ladies and gentlemen!
Sam, stop it.
My friends, it's a revolution.
We want freedom.
So let's be free!
I love this woman.
I love you.
I want to marry her.
Is there a sheik among you?
Who can marry us?
I can!
But I'm not a sheik.
- I'm a singer!
- Never mind!
I'll make your party
unforgettable!
You're from Ragga?
Can you please tell me...
- what I've done?
- Hmm-hmm.
Of course, you wouldn't know!
No idea?
Who yelled in the train
"It's a revolution, we want freedom"?
So now do you know what you did?
Do you know, Sam?
Sam, son of...
my uncle Jamal Ali.
Get out.
Thanks.
I can't be in Syria anymore.
There must be a way...
- We'll find a way.
- I have no choice, Abeer.
My sister's driving me to Lebanon today.
Does that mean it's over?
Is that him?
Oh.
- Everything okay?
- Please, give me a minute.
- What is it?
- A minute!
Okay.
Ziad!
You told me...
you know people on high places.
Sam is a classmate.
He was unfairly arrested.
Can you help him?
Hello.
Wrongful arrest? Why?
What happened to you?
Nothing at all.
I can't do anything...
Abeer?
I work at Foreign Affairs.
Abeer, let's go.
They're waiting for inside.
I'm so sorry.
What's going on?
Nothing, ma'am.
Take care.
Yes, Ma.
We just crossed the Lebanese
border.
Yes, all is well.
They're looking for you.
Fuck them.
Several people were killed.
Women and children...
Sam!
Huh?
Stop it! Life goes on.
What stood before
is no longer here.
There's rubble everywhere.
Smoke and dust fill the air.
And as we walk around
the corner, more victims...
Wait. Wait.
This artwork...
Is absolutely fantastic.
These two are the best.
Monsieur?
Can you give me your name?
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Madam.
Mrs. and Mr. Choukair.
- Welcome!
- Good.
Jeffrey's going to be so honored
to know you're here.
Thank you very much.
How are you?
He is a Syrian refugee.
Excuse me.
This is part of the exhibition.
The real food is inside.
And I recommend the caviar.
A total killing.
That's...
That's too bad. I...
I had dinner already.
You are Mister...?
Sam Ali.
And you?
You're not on the guest list,
Mr. Ali.
Excuse me, sorry.
Maybe.
Maybe, but...
I love art.
Can you stop by
at the end of the event?
I'll ask to prepare
a package for you
with what will be left over
from the buffet.
You know what?
Don' take it badly, okay?
Fuck you.
All right.
- Soraya?
- Yes?
What's going on?
Who is the guy?
A Syrian refugee,
a freeloader.
Hey!
Hey, hey.
Hey, man, wait!
Let me offer you a drink.
You don't need to offer me
anything, okay?
Are you a refugee?
And you?
What are you?
What am I?
You mean, who are we?
In a philosophical way
of speaking?
No, I mean...
Obviously, you are not
a refugee.
- No.
- Where do you come from?
Okay, I'm from Belgium.
Also kind of American.
Then you're born on the right
side of the world, no?
Well, I'm not complaining.
My girlfriend
is in Belgium.
Is she?
And why are you not
with her then?
Because I can't.
- Why can't you?
- Because I can't.
I just can't.
You, you can.
Me, I can't, okay?
You, you go to the airport,
you pick any place
that you want to travel to.
That's a nice energy
you have there.
It suits you.
You look very angry, huh?
- Of course I'm angry.
- You're an angry young man.
Yes, I'm an angry young man.
Of course,
I'm an angry young man.
Wouldn't you be angry?
I'm stuck here
and I can't visit my girlfriend.
And she cannot come over here
to visit you?
No.
No, she can't.
I need to go there to rescue her
from a monster.
But I don't have a horse.
Well, it's not a horse you need.
It's more like a flying carpet.
I can offer you one.
Offer me what?
A flying carpet
to travel freely.
What do you think,
you're a...
You're a genie?
Well, sometimes I think
I'm Mephistopheles.
You want my soul?
I want your back.
Did you show him your butt too?
You misunderstood me.
Why give a roof to all these chicks?
Because they're productive.
They depend on a system that
feeds them to take their eggs.
I want to be like them.
I'm sick of being a cock.
You want to be American's chick?
Stop it! He doesn't want to fuck me.
He's a famous artist, I'm telling you!
How do you know that?
Did you Google him?
Jeffrey, you love him or you hate him.
He's a genius.
He is the most sulfurous,
the most provocative,
and the most expensive
living artist at auction today.
Life is meaningless.
We are nothing. Less than nothing.
But people don't want to hear
that kind of truth, you know?
They want meaning.
I sell meaning.
Christ turned water into wine
just by touching it.
Jeffrey Godefroy turns worthless objects
into works that cost millions
and millions of dollars,
just by signing them.
What are you doing?
What?
What are you doing?
Changing the settings
so I can see you better.
Finish what you were saying.
Are you making good money
with your translations?
Of course not.
Most of my clients are Syrians
who've just arrived.
I translate documents
for their refugee status.
They have no money.
But it doesn't matter.
I heard
they closed the Syrian Embassy in Belgium.
Yes.
Ziad will be laid off.
He doesn't go to the office
but still gets his salary.
Lucky him!
That way,
you'll have more time together.
To make babies.
No?
Isn't that true?
Anyway...
I have a job in Europe.
What?
Hmm.
I just got a job.
For an artist I met here in Beirut.
He offered me a job.
But what kind of job?
A job.
He needs...
someone to take care of his paintings.
That's great!
So you'll be able to travel?
Yes, he'll arrange the visa and everything
But I haven't...
decoded yet.
What are you waiting for?
Say yes!
- Comer over!
- Come over?
Do you mean "Come over!" or...
I mean...
- Your husband's here.
- What?
Your husband's behind you.
Your husband, behind you.
I missed you.
Hi, Jeffrey.
It's Sam Ali.
Sam Ali.
You still want my back?
Yes, of course.
Mm-hmm.
Tell me again, how much?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
I'll call you tomorrow
and I'll let you know, okay?
Bye.
Welcome.
The deal.
Hello, Sam Ali.
I must confess, this deal
was a real Chinese puzzle.
I've... I've never drafted a contract
between a work of art of this nature
and its owner.
Perhaps the crux of the contract
is clause 11.
"Payment terms."
It states that you will get one-third
of any sale or resale value,
that could total hundreds
of thousands of Euros.
In consideration, you will have
to cooperate in good faith.
That means being available and on time
for all planned exhibitions.
Last but not least, we took into account
your request to settle in Brussels,
and this is explicitly set out
in the contract.
Goodbye, Sam Ali.
Thank you, William.
Give me your passport.
I'll take care of your visa.
Some pessimists rule that art is dead.
Well, I think art
has never been more alive
than it is today.
With my latest work,
I am exploring a new realm.
But why a Schengen visa?
Mm...
Once again...
we live in a very dark era
where if you are Syrian, Afghan,
Palestinian and so on,
you are persona non grata, hmm?
The walls rise.
And I just made Sam a commodity, a canvas.
So now he can travel around the world.
Because in the times we are living,
the circulation of commodities
is much freer than the
circulation of a human being.
Thus by transforming him
into some kind of merchandise,
he now will be able, according
to the codes of our time,
to recover his humanity and his freedom.
Now, that's quite a paradox, isn't it?
Sorry, it's not funny.
Are we going to sit like this all day?
Well, from now on, it will be forever.
I got it.
Music please!
Show me!
Gimmie that!
Go away!
Show them your real visa.
Show them.
Wait a sec.
Wanna see the visa, guys?
An artist tattooed a visa
to give him a visa!
Stop!
If I were him,
I would've painted Pinocchio on your cock.
To see his nose grow.
Chill out...
Take it!
Your phone, sir.
We are spending a few months in Brussels
for Jeffrey's exhibition, and...
I love Brussels.
I get that.
Relax.
The world is yours.
Everything is going to be fine.
Sleep.
C'mon, pick up...
Hi, Abeer, it's Sam.
You probably didn't recognize my number.
I tried to all you on Skype,
but you're not online.
I wanted to tell you
I've arrived in Belgium.
I'm at the hotel and everything's fine.
It's a lovely day.
I brought the sun with me to Europe.
Idiot!
Abeer, it's me again.
I called you earlier,
I was a bit confused.
I didn't mean to say it was
sunny because I'm here.
That was dumb!
No, I can't come down.
Hi, Abeer.
Yeah.
- How are you?
- Hi.
What's happening?
Hi, Sam.
Welcome!
So you're finally here?
And you're lighting up Europe!
You can consider our home your home.
Visit whenever you want.
Abeer makes a mean tabbouleh.
Just feel free, okay?
Don't by shy.
Focus.
Yeah.
That's good, man.
Can I... Can I choose one
to send to my mother?
Yeah, you have to ask Martin for that.
If he has the budget.
Yes.
We don't have much time
and we do have to finish the shoot.
Sam, could you turn around, please?
Yeah.
Hey, Sam, can you tilt your head forward?
I mean, can you put your head down?
Come on, put it down.
- More.
- More than this?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
More, more. Come on, Sam.
Yeah, good boy.
Hey, Jeff, can you put
your hand on his neck?
- My head?
- No, no, your hand.
- Hand?
- Yeah, your hand. Yeah, please.
Thank you. Good.
- No, that's silly.
- Come on, Jeff.
- No, we'll do...
- Yeah.
- Yes, like that.
- Like this?
Yes, man.
- That's it.
- Just to understand,
what do you do with the pictures
that you don't use?
Nothing.
I'm going to erase them.
Then why did you start
by taking pictures of my face?
Sam, it was more to make you comfortable.
- Yeah.
- And you, Jeff, bravo.
- It was nice.
- Thank you.
- I have everything that I need.
- Leaving.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Sam,
Sam, he's one of the
greatest photographers
and, you know, the pictures are
going to go all over the world.
You're going to be a huge star.
Listen, I took a picture of you.
It's really beautiful.
You can send it to your mother, hmm?
What do you think?
Beautiful, no?
It's my back.
It's your back, but it's beautiful.
- Thank you.
- Do you want any coffee?
Tea? Anything?
I'm going to bring you a coffee.
No, I'm okay.
- No, I'm going to bring you...
- I don't want anything, Soraya.
Good morning.
- It's beautiful.
- Are you finished?
Take your seat, please.
Who can tell me what
this tattoo represents?
It's a Schengen visa.
A Schengen visa is important,
it's very hard to get,
and foreigners need it
to come to Europe legally.
Legally means they have permission.
Do all the people who come from
far away have this tattoo?
Excuse me.
Yes?
What did she say?
She's asking if all the people
who come from far away
must have this tattoo to enter Europe.
Sir!
Sir, please.
- I just want to take a picture.
- No, please, sir.
Go back to your seat, please.
Come, children.
Sir.
I don't have the right
to speak to my fans?
No, please, sir.
Hello, room service?
Can you please bring me caviar for dinner?
Thank you.
Hello, Mr. Sam.
Sorry to bother you.
Adei Saadi, chair of the Organization
for the Defense of Syrian Refugees.
I followed your story in the media.
You're an exploited victim.
We can defend you.
I'm sleeping in a 5-star hotel,
I don't feel exploited.
They tattooed your back and put
you in a museum.
Is it a circus or a zoo?
They're insulting Syrians.
We won't let them exploit us
for being refugees.
We're here to help you.
I believe you.
But do you know what?
If I sell my back or my ass,
it's none of your business.
Goodbye.
Can you at least send me the link?
I'm not good with Facebook.
Your sister showed it to me.
And who shared it?
No idea,
an organization for exploited
refugees, how should I know?
Okay, okay.
Don't get upset, Ma.
I'll take a look.
That's right. Take a look.
Tell me, my son.
Did that artist harass you?
Tell me what he did to you.
I'm your mother, you can talk to me.
Tell me what he did.
He gave me a tattoo.
Is that all?
Yes, that's all!
What ere you thinking?
What kind of question is that?
The whole family are asking,
I don't know what to tell them.
Why didn't you tell me
the truth from the start?
- Some contract in Europe...
- Ma.
- I should've known.
- Ma.
Ma!
- They're jealous.
- What?
They're jealous!
Sure they are.
Of course they're jealous!
They're all dreaming of what I have.
You want me to leap for joy?
That's enough.
You should be proud of me.
Sir.
Hello?
Abeer Al-Khateeb, sworn address.
Sworn translator...
Shit!
Abeer Al-Khateeb,
sworn translator, address.
I couldn't find any matches.
How are you?
I'm good. Really good.
I have a lot of work on.
I'm looking after lots of paintings.
I'm trying to learn French and assimilate.
That's all.
Can I give you a hug?
Why are you crying, Abeer?
Are you pregnant?
No!
Did I cause problems with your husband?
Is that Zid's dinner?
Ziad...
Ziad, not Zid.
I can come back another time, I mean...
I'll call you next time,
before I come, if you like...
I don't know.
I'm glad I saw you.
I'm sick of this museum.
Let's go home.
Be patient.
There are so many...
things I want to show you.
Do you like it?
No.
Let's move on.
Help us to save Syria.
Sam Ali is just the tip of the iceberg.
Thousands of Syrians like him
are exploited everyday.
We must stop this.
Please, help us to save Syria.
We have a dignity.
We have human rights.
We will fight
for our freedom.
We will fight...
We will fight for a new Syria.
So this is your job, Sam?
Fuck you.
Listen to me, man.
You can tattoo your back, your ass...
But leave her alone.
- Ziad stop.
- Look at this fine Syrian specimen.
I'll show you.
Go on, turn around.
Son of a bitch!
Animal!
You're the shame of Syria!
Fuck off!
Am I in trouble?
I'm here to avoid that.
Who's this guy?
He vandalized a painting
that costs 11 million Euros.
Her husband.
Mr. Sam Ali.
Come on.
May I come in?
Why did you lie to me about your work?
Because I'm an idiot.
Yes.
Yes, I'm with him.
No, I haven't asked him yet.
Okay. Okay.
Are you on a mission here?
I have a favor to ask.
How can I help you?
Can you talk to the museum
so they stop suing Ziad?
Is it Ziad who just spoke to you?
- Answer me, was it him?
- Yes.
May I ask why you married him?
- Why you married him?
- I don't know.
Of course you do.
And you, where were you?
You'd vanished.
The country was on fire, bloodshed...
everyone wanted to flee.
People said, "Marry him and leave or
you'll regret it your whole life."
I felt obligated.
Obligated?
There are few things
we're obligated to do,
like flee the country
to not end up in jail.
You weren't obligated.
Do you think I can help him?
I'm no more than a painting to them.
Why did you come to this museum?
Why that particular museum?
Lady, the wife of...
hi Excellency?
Did he bring you to humiliate me?
"See the man you loved
what he's done to his back"
Does he think he's better than me?
Let him enjoy himself in prison.
You won't help him.
If he needs my help,
he can ask for it himself.
Instead of sending his wife to my bed.
You're right.
And you know the admiration I have
for Jeffrey's work.
But I'm sorry, Soraya,
but I have to suspend this exhibition
until the dust has settled.
Martin, you can't do this to us.
But there is this organization
threatening to press charges against us.
Their legal arguments are very strong.
I can't take any risks.
The people from
the organization, they're...
They're under arrest?
The people from the organization,
are they under arrest?
No, no, no.
Finally, we found a gentleman's agreement.
I'll be grateful
if you can do the same thing
for Ziad Abdallah.
Impossible. He tore a Ferri.
So what?
But it's barbarism, and he must pay.
Barbarism?
I will explain to you what is barbarism.
Sam, that's enough!
Martin, you can suspend the show
for two days if you need to,
but you can't throw us out like that.
I'm not used
to working with artworks
which are unpredictable,
and lecturing me on barbarism.
Well, if it's like that,
I will contact the people from
the organization
to join their legal action,
because you can imagine
they contacted me already.
I said no.
But...
I might change my mind.
Unless you stop the charges
against Ziad Abdallah.
Well, let me see what I can do.
What about the exhibition?
Soraya, don't ask
too much of me. That's enough.
I want to close this chapter
without any further dramas.
I called a taxi.
I'm going back to Syria.
I'll be waiting for you downstairs.
My mother is dead.
Your mother is dead?
Your mother is dead...
Sam's mom? How are you?
Is everything okay?
I'll pass you to Sam.
You're not in the school anymore.
Grow up a little.
Hello?
Hi. Ma.
Nothing, she was kidding.
I'll call you back.
I'll call you later.
Yes, he's with me now.
I promise you, everything will be fine.
Thank you for your trust.
That was the director of the museum.
He's waiting for us.
Oh, yeah.
Sorry.
This way please.
Thank you.
- Terrorist.
- Thank you.
What?
I didn't do anything, this time!
Show me.
Go ahead.
It's here somewhere.
Soraya, where are you?
Calm down.
How long have you been doing your job?
I'm going to take care of it.
No.
You should know by now
how to preserve your collection.
Turn around.
Skin is no different.
You're a woman.
You should know, right?
Wow.
- Calm down, Jeffrey.
- Don't touch me.
Okay, I won't touch you.
I'm just saying...
And I'm calm.
Okay, take it easy, then.
Can you take it easy?
It's just a pimple.
I know.
Okay, but for a pimple
you come out of nowhere,
but when I call you,
you don't answer any of my calls?
What's this?
Sam, I'm not your father.
I'm...
not your father.
Do you know the Pygmalion story about
the artist who...
falls in love with the statue he sculpted?
What?
The story about an artist
who falls in love
with a statue he sculpted,
and then he wants...
Or he wishes the sculpture comes to life.
Yes, okay...
Mm-hmm.
Well our story is completely,
completely the opposite.
So you want to turn me into stone?
No.
I can't.
So you wish I die?
We're all going to die,
my son.
Hello?
Hello.
Hi, Abeer.
Hello.
Am I disturbing you?
No, not really.
What do you want?
Just a moment, please.
Can you... Can you just give me one second?
If you're not alone, I can call you back.
Sorry, Abeer. What's the matter?
So you're not alone?
No, it's okay. I'm listening.
Who's with you?
My girlfriend.
Soraya.
Soraya?
The Soraya who works with you.
Mm.
Do you love her?
Abeer, can you speak up?
I can't hear you.
I wanted to thank you for what
you did for Ziad.
They reached an agreement.
Frankly, it was nothing.
You and I, we should turn the page.
You have Ziad.
and I have...
Soraya.
Are you really with Soraya
or are you lying to me?
Why would I lie?
Soraya is kind, and she knows
what she wants.
And she's good in bed.
You know what?
Hello! You know what?
I'm listening.
Stay in your dreams.
No, there.
Up.
Thank you.
Sam, your contract is binding.
Failing to perform will cost you.
You have pocketed
a million Euros from Christian.
In return, you have to go see him
wherever he wants once every three months.
It's okay.
But tell me, Soraya, with what passport?
Sam...
You forgot it on the train.
They just sent it to me.
"They just sent it to me!"
Bye.
Sam.
What? What?
Where are you going?
To get my back skinned.
Mahmud.
I'm tired. I want to disappear.
Don't say that, my child.
People are living in camps.
Others are dying out at sea.
Thank god you left on an airplane,
and you're living in a nice place.
- Mama?
- Clean and warm!
Mama?
I'm speaking to your brother.
- Sam?
- Is that Lina?
Thank you for all the money.
But it's too much.
What are you going to do with it?
My husband's calling.
He wants to open a restaurant.
Yes, darling.
I'm at my mother's place
to pick up Khalil.
Mama?
Mama?
Mama...
When did it happen?
Khalil, sweetheart. Wake up now.
Fetch me my computer.
It was a year ago.
An explosion.
The wall fell on my legs.
I'm sorry, Ma,
I was only thinking of myself.
The number of times I hung up on you...
Without ever asking if you were all right.
No, my love,
don't say that.
Whatever you do, I forgive you.
Come, sweetheart, don't be sad.
Tomorrow will be better.
Nice. Nice to see you.
Betty, I'm so happy you could make it.
How are you? Good.
It's good to see you.
You're looking beautiful.
Hi, how are you? Give me a kiss.
Enjoy, enjoy.
Mr. Waltz. Mr. Waltz, please.
Can I have a moment?
- Yes, of course.
- Please, please.
- For an interview?
- Yeah.
- Of course, of course.
- While you're here.
With my lovely wife,
if that's okay.
- Please.
- Yes?
What can I say? Hmm.
What can I say?
Okay, but to be totally honest with you,
I hesitated a lot
before buying Sam, you know?
Because I knew it's a work of art
I could never fully enjoy.
Do you see what I mean?
And that's very frustrating for me,
you know,
being a collector, as you all know.
So when I spoke
to my lovely wife about it,
do you know what she said?
Do you know what she said?
She said... Now, listen up.
"This work of art..."
- Tell me.
- Well...
"...bears the signature of the devil."
And that's when I decided, you know?
No, but more seriously,
I just could not let go by such...
I mean, look at it. Such a powerful...
masterpiece!
Really.
In India, a baby costs 40 Euros.
In Thailand, a surrogate mother
costs 1,200 Euros.
Bin Laden's head?
Twenty-five million dollars.
I mean, I'm not cynical.
Our world, our world is.
Okay, so how did you
convince Christian Waltz to buy Sam?
Oh, God, it was very complicated.
There were many collectors interested,
but each time the law
of this country or that country
prevented the transaction
because of conventions against
human trafficking,
prostitution, et cetera.
But Christian is a Swiss citizen,
and Switzerland is very much ahead
of other countries
in terms of legislation.
So the transaction was perfectly legal.
So the transaction can be seen
as human trafficking?
Oh, no. It's law that is behind.
And art, as we all know,
is always exploring new
unknown territories.
Hence the gap.
Why do you embellish things, dear Soraya?
Marc is just trying to tell you,
in a polite way,
that you are a perfect pimp.
I'm very sorry to interrupt.
This is Wim, our insurance man.
And I'm sure he'll be very happy
to answer all your questions.
He's a little shy, so take it easy.
No worries.
Thank you very much, Christian.
Hello, Wim.
I'm really happy to see you.
I'd like to have what's on your mind
regarding the price of the insurance.
How did you measure that?
It varies, depending...
according to the cause of death.
Of course, we wish Sam
a long and healthy life.
Yeah, but a long and healthy life
would suit you, wouldn't it?
I mean, what if he dies of cancer?
Cancer is fine, but...
But, for example,
if he dies of an explosion,
that would be really bad
for the insurance company.
And as we all know, his country is
presently at war.
Ladies and gentlemen,
now on display, lot 69,
by Jeffrey Godefroy.
Ladies and gentlemen...
3.5 million.
We have 3.5 million.
3,750,000.
We have 3,750,000 for now.
Four million?
Four million, ladies and gentlemen.
Four million.
Four million...
going once.
Four million...
Five million!
Five million,
ladies and gentlemen. Five million.
Five million going once,
twice...
Three times!
Sold for five million.
Whoo!
I'm happy here.
I don't need a lawyer.
So we can understand each other...
I was authorized to bring
a sworn translator.
Hello.
You'll be heard by the judge.
I'll ask for immediate release,
they've got nothing.
You'll be heard by the judge,
and he will ask for your release.
I'm happy to see you.
Hmm?
He thanks you.
Of course.
My conclusions.
Can you please translate?
Yes.
I've left the house.
And separated from Ziad.
I want to get to know you again.
We've lost too much time.
Good.
He only had at his waist
his ID and his phone earplugs.
He was listening to music.
He was not responsible for
the panic in the room.
He is a victim of racist prejudice
and easy conclusions.
Wait, wait...
No, no. Objection, Your Honor.
It's not true, what he says.
I wanted to scare these people.
Objection you Honor.
He wanted to scare people.
You Honor, given the lack of proof,
I request the immediate release
of my client.
There is no valid reason to charge him.
Thank you, you Honor.
However...
I see that your visa, Mr. Ali,
expired three months ago.
Mr. Ali, you are an illegal migrant.
You didn't go to your appointment?
Obviously, no.
You have 48 hours to leave the country.
Thank you. Thank you.
Mr. Ali, could you tell us
more about what happened
in the auction hall?
When you leave Europe,
where do you intend to go?
Your back is worth million Euros.
You think your life is in danger?
My client has no comment.
We'll reflect on the outcome
of the decision,
and then we'll decide on the next steps.
Okay? Thank you.
Give me your passport.
I'm going to take care of your papers.
Really?
Believe it or not,
I'm going to miss you, Soraya.
Wait!
Sam, jump in the car. I'll drop you off.
Oh, Soraya, give me a break. Come on.
I'll get it.
No.
Hi, Soraya.
I'm moving to...
to Raqqa.
Yes, Raqqa.
That's my hometown before it became Daesh.
Who controls what changes
every six months over there,
I don't care.
I have a beautiful house there.
All my uncles and cousins live there.
And to be honest,
I just want to go somewhere where I can,
you know,
be off the radar.
Where I can just disappear.
You understand?
Take care of yourself, Soraya.
My god...
Are you scared?
No.
Are you?
No.
Yes, Soraya, what do you want?
I'm at work.
Did you see Sam's video?
Yes.
Listen.
Listen, it's the insurance
you have to call, not me.
{\an8}We have with us Marc Sheen,
acclaimed documentary filmmaker
{\an8}and close acquaintance
{\an8}of renowned artist Jeffrey Godefroy.
{\an8}Thank you for joining us, Marc.
{\an8}Thanks for having me today.
{\an8}ISIS would have sold Sam Ali's skin
{\an8}to American art traffickers.
{\an8}Well, to be completely honest with you,
{\an8}I have no idea how
the skin ended up there.
{\an8}Is it a replica?
{\an8}No, it's not a fake.
{\an8}The test revealed that
the skin bears Sam Ali's DNA.
{\an8}It's the original one,
and that's an authentic artwork.
{\an8}So, what's next for the skin?
{\an8}Well, the law is very strict
regarding stolen art objects.
{\an8}Neither the gallery exhibit
nor the last collector
{\an8}would be legally authorized
to recover the piece.
{\an8}So, what happens usually
is that the police donates
{\an8}stolen artworks to national museums.
You all right, Sam?
Yes.
I'm in paradise.
Listen, your lab-grown skin
will soon be unveiled to the public.
I had to die
so I can finally live.
Thanks to my cells.
Nobody can suspect
what we can do with science.
Of course, it's a nice story to tell.
For posterity.
How we beat the system, Sam.
Jeffrey, you're funny, I swear.
You talk about beating the system?
The skin will be exhibited
in the most prestigious museums
around the world,
and even if one day they find out,
it will only increase your value.
The system loves you, Jeffrey.
They idolize you no matter what you do.
Do you know what's worse
than being part of the system?
It's being ignored by it.
By the way, I...
I made an appointment
to laser-remove the tattoo.
You're a free man, Sam.
Yes, I am.
And I've always been free.
