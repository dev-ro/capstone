TWENTY YEARS YOUNGER
Oscar is all wrong.
That's not what I asked.
Stop. Oscar, stop everything.
We have to do it all again.
Not the same color.
Here is sunshine yellow, and here,
Orange.
Not the same thing.
This is yellow-Brazil.
-I know.
But look here,
is not the same yellow.
Alice, please
already exchanged 4 times.
They are all tired,
and trust me ...
no one will notice
the difference.
I notice the difference.
We have to do it all again.
Sorry, Oscar, but
is not the same color.
I want to talk to him.
I keep falling in the mailbox.
He hung everything
the computer and the phone.
No one has access.
Except Lise.
She is on his side
since you traveled.
A stick only.
Last night we were having dinner
with the owner of the group.
What?
Kimmel appeared in Paris
unannounced ...
And all went to dinner
in Bristol.
I want to talk to him.
I can not.
He is unavailable.
Otherwise, how is in Brazil.
Is it hot?
Then I'll call you, Pauline.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Wait, let me put.
Thank you.
Hope I did not hurt him.
Thanks anyway.
Football.
Sorry, but you're in my seat.
This one is my place.
Are you crazy?
Sir, please sit down.
Sit with pleasure
but as you can see ...
Stay calm.
I am calm.
Follow me, please.
Where?
-Beyond.
I'm going.
Sorry what happened before.
Not introduced myself.
Laurent Touzan,
Alliance Francaise.
Listen, I don't know
anyone else in Paris.
Who knows,
we can have dinner together?
Pardon?
I like to be direct,
not to waste time.
Excuse me,
is that place free?
I'm afraid not,
this young man will sit here.
Sorry,
i have interrupted the conversation ...
Sit.
-Lady?
-Yes.
Have you made your choice?
I'll take lobster, thanks.
I also want lobster.
I hope it's pretty cool.
I'm sorry, sir, but as
you came from economic ...
you are not entitled to the menu
from first class. Sorry.
Lady, have you made your choice?
Ladies and gentlemen,
Here is your captain speaking.
Our plane is coming
to zone of turbulence.
Keep your seat belts
fastened well, thank you.
don't worry.
Just convergence in
the intertropical zone.
The hot air mass
that is the cold air.
Then it happens.
Look for commissioners.
I do this to reassure me
and always works.
Sorry, sorry ... excuse me
In fact, there is a chance
in a million ...
Yes.
actually
one chance in a billion.
A small margin ...
Sorry.
No problem.
It was nothing.
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.
It was a pleasure almost
die with you.
Balthazar.
My name is Balthazar.
Alice.
Wait.
Alice, your flash drive.
That is ridiculous
I would have taken a taxi.
It is a pleasure for me.
I needed fresh air.
At the airport?
So how are the Brazilians?
You scared me.
The doll is for you,
bought it in Rio.
Show it to your friends.
Sure, mother, sure.
Take that.
Thank you for cancer.
Sorry, Zoe.
Lady. Lady.
Alice! Alice! Damn!
Alice!
Lamborghini Gallardo Spider.
It is for the show on Tuesday.
Genial. Where do I put this?
Richard is free on Wednesday.
Dinner at home.
No scandals. Promise?
There are other patterns
to be with a guy.
When I say I'm
happy without a man ...
no subtext.
I'm happy without a man,
Wednesday.
Without negotiation.
What the fuck -
your gynecologist!
You must be joking.
What is the problem?
He is sensitive, charming,
workhaholic affectionate and like you.
Also does not come with
else ...
for a long time,
just like you.
Looks fantastic.
It's lovely.
Good morning, Mrs.. Lantins.
Good day.
How much years continence?
-8 Years.
And how was the capital
world of dental floss?
Between the teeth?
Between the teeth?
Lunch?
Can not.
A desperate woman returned.
What did you say? Apfel?
Good morning, Pauline.
-Alice.
Vincent is waiting
and mr. Apfel has something yours.
Apfel, don't know.
I'll be in your office.
It's a complete mess here.
Morning.
Morning.
don't do anything I ask.
They are impossible.
Mrs. Lantins!
How are you?
Very well. And you?
Do you know about the dinner
between Lise and Kimmel?
The already stressed
arrived with everything.
Speak of the devil,
she got here.
Yet another. This. Hi
Hi, girl you are too.
I'm always doing
my best.
Hi Alice,
you got a tan.
Thank you.
I'm kind of stunned ...
we left at 6 am
Beyond the Baron ...
Garou with rubbing
me, the guy is pathetic.
It is.
Good luck to you. Goodbye.
Right.
My God, it was a great ride.
Yes.
Can we talk?
In and close the door.
I went to the Chinese restaurant
near Central Park.
We both love.
Yes, I remember.
Where fucked
on the table.
You were so manly,
so strong.
I better come back later.
No, please sit down.
What a wonderful transaction,
you were too.
Listen, I liked the reminder,
I'm with Alice now.
Even more.
Long distance relationship,
I can not stand ...
frankly, it bothers me.
Saw the matter we have unleashed.
Look. Vincent Kahn
leaves the old continent.
You like the photo?
Yeah, it's great.
I'm super happy.
It was good in Bristol?
How was the meeting
Kimmel and Lise?
News travels fast!
It was only a small
impromptu dinner, that's all.
Look, you said you trust
the "Rebelle" for me.
I'm about to turn 40,
Vincent.
Really? 40?
She's really amazing.
She makes three thousand things.
Has a blog
artist's body ...
burlesque dancer!
Married three times.
Man, woman and
man again.
We need someone
that makes you dream!
Balancing structures.
If you don't make me dream ...
as will make readers dreaming?
Are you telling me
I'm too old?
Picasso died aged 91
with a child's heart.
Nothing to do with age.
It's a question about
attitude, you know?
don't look at me like that,
makes my blood run cold.
Things did not go
exactly as you would like.
This magazine is
a quarterly publication.
The job of editor
is part-time.
So you can take care
of your family.
-Are you kidding me?
Of course not.
She has great drawing.
30 000 subscriptions,
is not to throw away.
I'm going back to my work.
Say, can you take me at the party
in Alex Friday night?
I know, it's scary.
It's you, but ...
I want to surprise you.
Are you okay?
-Yes.
You look tired.
You think so?
No, I'm in great shape.
You have no bread?
This is good.
Spent in inter
last week.
Sales were madness.
Really?
Martin is radiant, he wants
another of these in September.
I did not have to write
a line.
between that and my lectures ...
You want something to drink?
No, thank you.
I don't want
a little massage?
Wait.
You always had magic fingers.
Incidentally, Agata encountered
your book.
She found it very good.
What's the title again?
The lsland without Oceans.
The lsland without Oceans!
don't laugh.
Okay, is good.
Hi, Charlotte.
-Hello.
Here is your mother.
I love you, my love.
Be careful.
And now, she nods.
Mr. Apfel. Pen drive. Airplane.
We'll see.
-Hello?
-Hello?
Hello?
Can you hear me?
Who is?
This is Mrs.. Lantins,
I sat beside her on the plane.
Alice?
Good night, good night.
You left me a message.
Found the pen drive, is it?
Yes I found your pen drive.
I have it.
God, thank you.
We can meet
somewhere?
Sure.
When you want.
You can now?
Now?
Yes, of course I can.
Where?
I'm in the 162 The Dock
I'm going.
What the hell.
The guy does not seem to see me.
Are you okay?
Yes.
I'll tell you what was
what happened.
Alice. Alice. Here.
Look, it's not far,
is the end of the bar.
I'm in a hurry.
Is full because
the'' happy hour''.
Said I'm in a hurry.
Really, crazy.
Look who's here?
I never imagined seeing her in
a place like this.
I know, at this time,
her age ...
will take two years
to recover!
Fanny and Guillaume,
friends of the school of architecture.
Alice is ...
A well-known.
Good night.
You want a drink?
-Only my pen drive.
But it's in my home.
In your home?
I did not understand
well on the phone.
I said I had
your pen drive.
With me.
But not here now.
It's in my house.
Where is your home?
-Say what?
Where is your home?
My house?
Yes, I know.
The site seemed else ...
but the picture was black and white.
Soon you'll get used to it.
Shall I go on the back?
don't worry;
I am very careful.
Right.
Can I? There is one
special way.
Sorry. Ready.
You are ready.
Go.
Straight to the'' twitter''.
-Direct?
-Yeah.
Come in.
Welcome to my humble abode.
Is very good.
You got ridiculous.
No, it was well cut.
This time is not picking up.
I have to meet
him soon.
Baltha, already at home?
Yes, as you can see.
Anissa, what are you
doing here?
I. .. you explain.
You'll never guess.
Was filming in Paris ...
And see who i met
on the street ...
Sorry, this is Anissa.
Good night.
Dated with her in
elementary school.
Long ago.
My father. Alice.
Yes, Baltha spoke highly of you.
Daddy, please.
You have five minutes?
-To?
To show you the new theme
in my show.
I need another
female opinion.
It is you who give
consistency to the program.
Every Wednesday,
with Luc Apfel.
'' Behind the Wheel!''.
Getting behind the wheel
the biggest sporting ...
Still without the effects,
nor was mixed, is forgiving.
Run on legendary circuits ...
release your adrenaline
in the best company.
Luc tests the dream cars
and reveals the secrets.
Jealous?
Every Wednesday at 1 1.
'' Behind the Wheel''.
Come and discover the secrets
behind those wonderful cars.
So?
Well .. yes ... is ...
I want sincerity.
It has a footprint.
Let's eat.
I am hungry.
That sounds good.
How about a bucket of fried chicken?
Thank you.
-Come on.
I'm going.
Okay, I'm going.
Leaves the two there.
Go ahead.
You can take my pen drive?
Sorry, pen drive, of course.
Where is?
Sorry, I know the pen is here
but don't know where.
Want some tea?
I have white, green, black.
Don't you? Right.
Want a book to read?
I have a lot.
Bjorn the Morphiz''''
'' The Forest of Hanged Foxes.''
Good book.
'' Age'' des ...
PRAISE OF OLDER WOMEN
Your pen drive.
Here you are. I thought.
Thank you.
Want a ride?
I'll take a taxi. Thank you.
Alice. Alice.
We have coffee one night?
A night?
A morning or afternoon.
I'm always free.
And why coffee?
Explain.
Because all soda
are effervescent and then ...
You're a boy
very kind.
But it's not my style to get out
with boys in your age.
Is that understood? Goodbye.
Taxi.
POINT OF PURCHASE
Appointments today.
Pauline, what's happening?
I'm giving you the
list of appointments.
Why everyone is laughing?
Nothing, why?
Why?
There is a rumor about you.
Rumor, but what rumor?
There's a rumor that ...
Pauline.
Look.
COUGAR
-Vincent.
-Speak.
We received proposals for
photoshoot ...
-And I need your approval.
It's okay.
Take a look.
I thought it was
'' Photoshop'' or something.
What?
How old?
Vincent, you are not
believe I...
Stop. It's looking that
you was caught in the act ...
and is giving an excuse
clueless, seriously.
Vincent, you're even
believing that?
I promise you that ...
Alice, don't worry,
this is what I want from you ...
I seek. The unusual,
a little magic.
You and the boy
did it for me.
The spirit of "Rebelle".
I love it.
Enjoy. Goodbye.
Vincent sees you as a
Bourgeois demure.
Prove him wrong.
He despises workaholics.
What do you suggest I do?
To stop working?
I do a piercing
the clitoris?
Very painful.
"Mother I'd Like to Fuck.''
Mother-like what?
-Fuck.
Balthazar, your teenager.
Do you understand me?
Want me over
a teenager ...
to please my boss?
Are you crazy?
I like my job,
but doing so is ...
Hey wait ...
pretend you're into him.
Subtle difference.
Go to parties, holding hands ...
in public places and bingo.
Alice version 2.0.
Hello lady Courtois.
How long.
I'll stop now.
Rebel?
Right.
How about a small restaurant?
Could be.
-Japanese, who knows?
-Good idea.
Balth? What do you think?
What are you waiting for?
Should I?
Alright? Hello
Good day.
What are you doing here?
I've lost your number,
I confess.
So I thought I'd come,
therefore, by surprise.
It's good to see you.
Can you show me the place?
Yes, yes.
Come on.
Super!
Funny, that brings back
many memories.
Seems like yesterday.
-Did you study here?
-No.
Mean about the whole thing
college.
The errors that we committed
and everything else.
I was dating a guy
at the time, a friend ...
his name is Bastien.
Bastien, Balthazar.
Interesting you begin with'' ba''.
Yes, it's funny.
Are you free tonight?
-Tonight?
-Yes.
I'm free ...
yes I'm free.
Cool. I send
address by SMS.
Alright.
-See you.
-Until.
What are you listening to?
Metronomy.
And what else do you like?
Azealia Banks, Wu Lyf,
Chromatics ...
The Stones, Dad thinks
is because of him.
Azealia Banks, Wu Lyf,
Chromatics ...
Azealia Banks, Wu Lyf,
Chromatics ...
Mother, what?
Yes, yes!
Well, go there. Chantal arrives
in fifteen minutes.
Azealia Banks, Wu Lyf,
Chromatics ...
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Sorry, I just thought about this outfit.
-It's fine.
Are you sure?
Sure.
You are wonderful.
Thank you. Come out of the cold.
Come on.
What are you listening to?
This one.
I Like Azealia Banks, Wu Lyf,
Chromatics.
Look, who she brought.
You have something there.
Really?
No, it's gone.
Very cool.
Experience is fun.
Ready.
Want something to drink?
It's really embarrassing.
Claude!
It's really amazing!
More powerful than
your last show.
You think so?
Yes, yes, yes.
By the way, let me
present, this is Balthazar.
-Hello.
Thank you.
Balthazar ... Claude Malle,
the reason we are here.
Are you ...
My modest way.
What do you think?
It's something ... so ...
You can be honest.
I'll understand.
This idea - you
popping up everywhere ...
why not?
Again, two time, three times,
four, five.
I realize that you have a certain
problem with your image.
It becomes an ego trip
almost childlike ...
devoid of any
interest to us.
Irony, yes, cool.
-See you.
-Until.
But what got into you?
He told me to be honest.
Nobody says what he thinks here.
Contemporary art
is annoying.

On my street, there's a guy
with a small atelier ...
He has magnificent paints.
I'll introduce you to him.
But this is all about
selling yourself.
This is the system, Balthaz ar.
Get used to it.
I'm happy out of the system.
With one foot there and one there.
Sorry.
Ready.
It's him.
Simon, very pleased.
It's an honor to meet you.
We have to go find
Vincent.
No problem.
This is Balthazar
a friend.
Pleasure, Balthazar.
Good night.
Alright?
Good night.
Good night. Hello
I'm still stunned.
All this seems so absurd.
So.. so hard to believe.
Dunno.
I wanted to know a
little better. That's it.
If someone had said:
I'd be here with you.
Hello
this is something ...
Hello, are we bothering you?
Nah, it's okay.
Looking for your boss?
And he called me saying
could not come.
Missed the chance.
-Do you want a joint?
What did you say?
You don't want a joint?
-No.
Had a '' bad trip'' once.
But maybe you ...
Alice? Are you mad?
Alright.
Go.
Go easy on the ...
Good.
Attention.
Sorry.
What?
I'll give you space.
Sorry.
Hello?
Where are you. Richard arrived
an hour ago.
Who came?
-Richard, my doctor.
-But, what doctor?
-My gynecologist, Alice.
Listen, I'm so embarrassed.
Come right now.
Get it?
Something serious?
-Doctor?
You mentioned a doctor.
Yes, the doctor, because my
daughter had appendicitis problem.
I have to go.
-Which hospital? I'll take you.
No, a taxi is faster.
A taxi.
Taxi. Taxi is an emergency.
You don't need. No.
It's an emergency.
-No. Watch out.
-Stop!
Comes between.
Lady, I say, sir,
please leave.
Come on, Alice.
Which hospital?
What hospital?
The American hospital.
Should I go?
What?
No. Because my daughter
would not understand.
Go quickly.
don't waste time.
Will.
University Street, please.
It's not the American hospital?
University Street.
Strength, Alice, strength.
Take it. It's all yours.
Please throw the cigarette away.
Okay, sorry, sorry.
When?
Honey, you dine with us?
-Eat?
-Eat.
No. Yes
I'm sorry.
She not doing this, normally.
My sister usually
is punctual, doctor.
Richard, please.
Richard finally
you will meet her.
Beware, she is very fragile.
Bib.
Long ago she
had a relationship with someone.
Do you understand me?
But I think a gynecologist
will reinvigorate her.
She came.
don't let me down.
I hope you all enjoy lamb.
I just love it.
-Richard?
No, thank you ...
I'm staying in vegetables.
-Neither the couscous?
Nothing carbohydrate at the night.
Even so, thank you.
Want to live to be
a hundred years old?
It's that I'm vegan.
-Vegan?
I eat only raw food.
Richard, how you met Elizabeth,
my sister?
Alice is tired due
Brazil's trip here.
She's a little ...
Really, sorry. Sorry.
Alice is true that in Brazil
has much shemale?
The Brazil?
There shemale galore.
Ask your parents
take you there.
You know, Richard is an expert.
In-transgender?
Really? You operate them?
Sex with them?
What?
That's not it.
It is great specialist
in South America.
It really is a fascinating region.
I've been in Honduras
last year.
-Honduras?
That's right.
People are
really friendly.
Very authentic.
Throughout Latin America ...
people are closer
to the nature of life.
Closer to themselves.
They live in the moment.
Countries are also very
dangerous for visitors.
Kidnapping a day
cold-blooded murder on the other.
Wow, I'm sorry.
No problem.
Are you okay, Alice?
Just give me a second.
So what's for dinner?
Good morning, Caroline.
No, something unexpected happened.
That's it.
Something last minute,
don't worry.
I know that.
Hello
Alright? What?
I missed you last night.
My nephew arranged a night
sushi with his cousins.
The presentations.
Balthazar, Vincent,
Vincent, Balthazar.
Pretend a little over 5 minutes and
I sleep around midnight.
We arrived.
Faster.
Hello. Alright?
And who is this?
Is the owner of the group.
No, Balthazar.
Are you okay?
Yes, I am.
You sure?
-Yes.
Is that part of the show?
Look, I'm sorry
for what I did there.
I will control myself.
Promise.
All right, no problem.
Alice. Alice. I am here.
Come on. Come.
Yes, we will.
Balthazar.
Hello
Alright.
And Tracy, gone?
-Stop being obsessive.
In 20 years, I never saw boy
with so much class.
It is true.
Thanks, I owe it to all
education of my mother.
If I had not
helped the girl ...
it would scare me
in my nightmares.
As a shrew saying:
'' I taught you manners.''
You forgot?
Where are your manners?
But it's amazing!
Where did you find him?
Now tell me,
where did you two meet?
We both?
Yes, apparently you
are inseparable.
She has already met your friends?
My friends?
-Do your parents know?
My parents? Why?
About you and her?
They already know?
Enough, let's dance,
love this song.
Come dance, Balthazar.
I think they're just pretending?
They are not fucking,
is that you saying?
Yes.
-Not a quickie?
-No.
There is the mother of Zoe?
I want to shoot.
-I will.
-I will.
Get your hands off me.
-Come on.
-Now?
Yes, I want to be alone
with you. Come.
Stop it.
See, they were gone.
Silly.
They were gone?
I think so,
to make love, this is it.
Thank you. Goodbye.
I parked on that side.
Ready.
I'll walk, this
time the streets are dangerous ...
I don't want to risk it.
But I live right there.
A lot can happen
within a few meters.
It's okay.
Are you sure?
-Sure.
It's late right?
I don't know.
I forgot my watch.
It must be two o'clock in the morning.
Thank you very much.
-No problem.
Goodbye.
Buona notte''''.
Buona notte.
But that asshole.
There is buona notte''''.
There is buona notte''''.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Alice.
I came to apologize by my Italian -
it's horrible.
Sorry, your daughter is here?
No, she's out
this weekend.
Balthazar.
Listen, no, Balthazar, no.
Yes.
My room. Come.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Stop apologizing.
Don't stop.
2x2 = 4.
8 is 4x2, 8x4 is 32.
32x2 equals 68, 64. 64.
Angela Merkel,
Eva Joly ...
Eva Joly, Jean Luc Melenchon.
Jean Luc,
Jean Luc Melenchon ...
Shut up.
-What time is it?
It's late. It's pretty late.
Time to get up.
I have to go home.
But you're at home,
are you?
Yes, exactly.
Goes up.
Ok!
I'm very busy and ...
don't worry ...
I have many classes
to follow.
-But the shoe?
-I have not found another.
And going out like that?
-No problem.
Always carry it
as a precaution.
It seems that the rain pouring.
A little bit.
don't worry about me.
Alright.
Stay until the rain stops.
Damn.
Alice Lantins?
Are you a writer?
Sorry, but Zoe
ended with the cornflakes.
Here you are. I found some
things you might like.
I think I'll take
only the tea, please.
Good
-Talk about what?
What? My book?
None.
-No.
-I want to read.
-To have a trial.
-No. No.
Why not? I read fast,
i will finished in two days.
No.
Please.
Is waiting for someone?
I said put it
in your bag.
-Hello.
-Hello.
That weekend was
terrible ...
rained the whole time
and not a single ...
sun light.
Elisabeth, good day,
this is Balthazar ...
-What is my ...
-Hello. I am ...
-My intern.
-The trainee.
Here are photos
you asked.
Right.
-Your headphones are right here.
Right.
Do you need help?
Give me a kiss.
If you have any missing
something just let me know.
What are your listen?
What?
Is that ...
Zoe go to your room.
-But Mom, I just got here.
-Go to your room.
I'll get going then.
-House of domination.
I'll do my
job right, lady.
Nice to meet you.
-Also.
Goodbye.
One second.
-Balthazar.
What?
I'm sorry.
3 copies for tomorrow
at 9 am in your office.
That's it?
-Go.
I don't know.
It just happened.
There was nothing planned.
-All right.
What?
Why are you looking at me like that?
The reality pounding fiction.
The story within the story
which is more than the story.
This is good.
You can laugh at me.
Yes.
SORRY,I'M LATE, BUT ...
LOOK UNDER THE BANK.
One, two, one, two.
Testing.
Alice, are you listening?
You really want to go on this
party tonight?
We could go out just us two.
His first mission ...
is to locate a vehicle
totally pink ...
a bike low cylinder ...
it will soon be
near you.
You will have to
rise this vehicle.
The other mission ...
is not asking the direction
it is going.
The driver has no idea.
How about a little music?
He has a name?
It's called:
'' Loser,'' Dolphin.
No,'' Hick, Dolphin''.
He insisted I take it,
but I kept my position.
My small victory.
Alice can make you
a question?
You are fun,
beautiful and intelligent, why ...
Why me?
No, it's a dumb question.
I even answer.
Sorry.
I want to read
'' My boyfriend of the week''?
I called:
'' On Wednesday evening
my boyfriend cheating''.
A man in perfection.
It does everything you want.
You got the best,
maximum beauty.
And of course,
sex, sex.
Yes it is possible.
That shocked you?
No, of course not.
What theme do you put
on the agenda this week?
My heels are
too high!
How to avoid stains
armpits?
What?
Let's see I thought the theme:
'' We are all
stereotypes of'' Youporn.
-Do you'''' what?
Youporn-Do you know?
Blonde, redhead, brunette,
Milf ...
'' Mothers who like to fuck''
ie I.
Look, I think what we have here
is a great research team.
Lila, if you knew
how many men masturbate ...
thinking of a extra large type'''',
you'd feel fine.
Clementine, your roommate,
stop blame her ...
to do the little things in
the internet ...
and show her you
are more horny ...
than a teen.
And as for me, I was
earned the label Cougar or Milf ...
because I have young legs around me?
I don't care.
Let's let the fantasy
transcends fantasy.
Because the fantasy will not change.
But we are alive, are we?
We are all stereotypes
from Youporn?
We are.
But men need
chase.
I conclude with this ...
or something
like this.
I've been using him.
Now I have to tell the truth.
We don't have any chance in
real life.
Sure.
Alice, don't even think
about dating this boy.
Look at you.
Crow's feet, fine.
But wrinkles.
What will happen when
your face become only wrinkles?
No. This has to end,
and soon, now, immediately.
Sorry,
I lost track of time.
No problem. Come on.
Come. Come in. Carry on.
You first.
The committee
Communist Party Central ...
meets here. I love it.
Niemeyer was a genius.
He imagined the whole thing and
drew everything in 3 days ...
no charge.
Is 50 years old and
not aged at all.
It is almost futuristic.
A drink?
Maybe we can go next
weekend.
A friend gave me the keys
of his parents' house in Brittany.
It is a sensational place
on the beach.
It would be good to have a break.
What do you think?
Just a second.
Hello.
What did I say?
Not break.
Go to bed and ready.
That's it. Good night.
Zoe can also come.
To Brittany.
Zoe can also go.
After all I performance
the role of trainee.
I just need to see if there is a place
to make copies around.
And ready. Not?
It's a little early for that.
Undoubtedly,
is a little early.
Yes, early. I think ...
It's crazy.
I wanna be with you
all the time.
I took my temperature
3 times today.
But I'm not sick.
Only have a crazy will
to see you.
An urge, Alice.
Hello.
Hello.
Give it to me.
Zoe what we agreed?
You obey Chantal ...
and go to bed immediately.
Not without discussion.
You are busy.
I can not stay long.
The life of a mother
working.
I can handle it.
Are you sure?
Yes, of course. Sure.
So, tell me.
Will wait for Zoe to sleep
watch a DVD with me?
I am patient,
and to my knowledge ...
film is limited, I ...
I'm serious, Balthazar.
You will get home
at 3 o'clock in the morning.
On weekends or
do things off the cuff.
No, I'm the homemade kind.
No, this is normal
you need to do ...
these things at your age.
I'm going to hate me
if you prune.
Think about it ...
when I'm 40,
you will be 21.
And when I am 50,
you will have 31.
What I mean is ...
What will happen when
if we see then?
What are you saying?
don't think it
a good idea ...
we keep on seeing.
I don't understand.
Finally you
having fun.
How did he take it?
Accepted-what?
All theater you rode.
You tell him, I hope.
Because then your love life
is not traumatized ...
by a woman.
Yes, yes, yes,
I told him.
Told him?
Explained to him?
Yes.
More than a thousand emails in three days.
Your article on Youporn.
Reviews of all France.
Incredible.
Cool.
How is Balthazar?
-Great.
They are always coming out?
I love being with him.
Go raves midnight,
after parties.
What midnight?
Forget it.
After parties?
It was your idea, remember?
Charlotte?
What happened?
Who did this?
Who do you think?
-Bye, sir.
She said that
Charlotte humiliated.
Your daughter is very sensitive.
Julien,
just tell me the story.
So Charlotte showed
for everyone ...
something on her iphone
and Zoe get mad.
On her iphone?
He has at least 18 years?
What's the problem?
You know, you're pretty videogenic.
To.
I don't know how you
will explain this to Zoe.
You have no right to talk like that.
Sure I can.
Agathe will be 29 in December.
It is almost 30.
Alice, it is different,
I am a man.
don't be an asshole.
How can you be so stupid?
Is not paid to think?
don't blame Zoe for 25 centuries
social history.
Maybe social history.
Excuse me, mister.
See? Thank you.
Explain it to her.
Zoe, Zoe. No, no.
Zoe, I'm talking to you.
It's only been a month since
you meet.
3 days after I met your mother,
she was pregnant.
Precisely.
-So spoke with your friend?
I talked.
You will look at that?
Yes, my cat,
everything is under  control.
Thanks, Balti.
-No problem.
Look at this. Looks!
Your new mother.
I'm taking her to Bali
for two weeks.
You will have the apartment
just for you.
Take care of her.
You heard me?
Are you okay?
Yes, I am.
It is because of her?
The Cougar?
I remember when
verged your age ...
and met a woman
in Calabria, Francesca.
Wonderful and twice
my age.
She taught me everything.
We make love many hours.
I'll spare you the details.
I had never felt that.
Seemed destined
to last forever.
Do you understand me?
I was done.
Physically and spiritually.
-Spiritually?
-Yes.
One day, for no apparent reason,
I felt ...
I felt something strange.
Intoxicating.
What worried me.
Then went to the doctor.
Entering his office
I saw a intern ...
She had dark skin.
A wonder of nature.
As she closed the door ...
we fucked, fucked
and sex.
I held ...
We writhed.
Father goes straight to the point.
I looked like a student
Classic Art ...
which had fallen
by modern, you know?
No, don't get it.
Come home for dinner tonight.
I can not tonight.
-Why not?
Because I have work to do.
It will not.
Listen, Alice, this is irrelevant.
What are you talking about?
I just need to start the night.
You sure you're okay?
I'm fine. Very well.
Alice.
Yes?
don't you remember me?
I don't remember.
Arnaud. Arnaud Gaillard.
Arnaud Gaillard?
Twelfth year. Peperoni.
Peperoni.
Peperoni, you had
rather acne.
It is.
Sorry, but  I did not recognize you.
-Hello.
-How are you?
What are you doing here?
-I was playing squash.
Single?
What?
I mean, no wife
or children? Nobody?
I'm as far as I know.
Interesting.
We go to the mall.
We'll see you around, Arnaud.
Sure.
Arnauld, but of course.
Your friend with acne problem.
Well charming. Why not
picked up his phone?
Why would I take
the mobile number?
To call him.
Babette, give me a break.
What's the problem?
It is the job?
-No, no.
What?
Stop it.
No more trying to play
men on top of me.
don't do it.
It seems that is
transferring things to me.
Find a lover,
go see the psychiatrist ...
but give me a break.
don't blame me if it does not
is sex.
Frankly.
Queued.
All misbehaving.
With elegance.
Simon especially.
Is everything okay?
Alright?
What time is it?
Tracy.
Tracy. But that pleasure.
You are fantastic.
We have smoke detectors.
Here is my staff.
Of course, Alice Lantins.
It's a pleasure.
This is the cover of the
next month.
Rebelle on the cover page.
Or from behind.
And we text here
and more text here.
This is the pink version.
I love pink, it's fantastic.
The Pink Panther.
Pink looks good.
It works very well.
It will not work.
What's the matter, Tracy?
It's the font?
The layout?
No, everything is great.
The problem is
the male model.
It looks like it is
with intestinal problem.
Sorry, Tracy,
but Louis Gradel.
He is very famous in France.
Versace. Dior.
Is not it, Alice? Lauvin.
He looks like an asshole.
How about this?
This?
Maybe this?
What do you think of this one?
I would not want it
or as a janitor.
By God, should not
be so difficult.
Cute.
Not the boy who helped
that girl in the show?
Who?
Who?
Him, I believe you know him,
don't you?
Of course,
and know him very well.
You like him?
I think so.
We need someone different.
Someone unusual.
It is a great idea.
It is exactly what
I was thinking.
No, no, no.
He will be an excellent model.
No, he is not model.
Alice, he will do very well.
He is not model.
-I want it!
Look, Tracy, you know, I don't
I think it's a good idea.
I beg your pardon?
Tell me something,
you want the job?
Yes, but it is not model.
Will not get it right.
He's not your boyfriend?
-Yes.
But he has patience and it is
incredibly conscious.
Listen, but listen well,
is how it goes ...
if you fuck with me now ...
You will be out of the picture.
You understand
what I'm saying?
You are seeing large
architectural designs.
If you want to talk to Balthazar ...
leave a message after the beep.
The country, the city and suburbs,
old and new buildings.
The real estate market
is reborn.
Let's take a look
more closely at ...
One of the icons of gynocracy,
Mantis is this special ...
select her partner
through sexual ...
young male specimens.
Yes, of course.
I'll call you tonight.
I'll call.
What the hell?
What did you do?
Are you sick?
Are you okay?
You better take a shower.
Damn, but what is this?
Balthazar? Balthazar, is Alice.
Balthazar.
Open up, please.
I'm coming.
It's her.
-But who?
-Alice. Go talk to her.
-don't open the door.
She'll think
i'm stoned.
Go see her. Quickly.
But it's stink.
It's disgusting.
Nothing clean.
Damn.
Grab my shirt.
Grab my shirt.
Go, go, go.
Hello
Alice.
Good day.
Can I come in?
Do you want something?
Yes, I will. Pineapple juice?
I'll see if I have it.
Good morning, Alice.
Morning.
Are you okay?
-Yes.
I knew I had a little left over.
don't do it.
You get old and think
it is wiser ...
but she did not show up.
I waited for her but
she never appeared.
My God!
I'm sorry.
Run your fingers through
my hair, please.
Thank you.
Let's get out for a drink.
Yes, we will.
There, there.
Right. Can we go?
Coffee. It seems reasonable.
Yes, it does.
Your father seems
very desperate.
I hope he can
recover.
Yes, he will overcome.
Sure. He is strong.
Good to see you.
I don't know how to start.
I want to ask you a favor.
What?
Photos? I'm not a photographer.
You will be photographed.
For the cover.
It's a working day
and it's pays very well.
Very well.
With the most beautiful
girls on the planet.
Sounds like fun, doesn't it?
Listen, it was good to see you,
but let's leave it as is.
Balthazar.
Bye.
Balthazar, sorry to bother you ...
I'm again.
Call me back, please.
It's okay.
He is on the way.
-Are you sure?
-Yes.
For your sake,
he better come right.
Told me it was a lake,
but it is a puddle.
There it is.
Patrick, darling.
Stop, you're sick.
No.
You're in great shape,
nonetheless.
So stick your tongue in my
back and waits for the fart.
Who are we waiting for?
How? And why?
It is. Who and why?
What the hell.
Not quite a wait.
Who we are waiting
're stuck in traffic.
-Kim.
-Yes.
Can we talk a minute?
-What are you doing?
What am I doing?
When are you going to tell them
Balthazar that will not show up?
Who said he does not come?
It comes ...
Alice, it does not come.
Tell them.
No.
I expect in a puddle
urine by a guy ...
nobody knows?
Wait for nobody.
You pay for
be ventriloquist dummy?
Patrick is a beautiful day.
Relax. Enjoy the sun.
Come on.
-Kim.
-Yes.
Arm some reflectors
around the lake.
Vincent, we need to talk.
The fact is that Balthazar did not ...
Alice, Alice, he is
through security ...
so I get
mand for makeup.
Thank you.
It was nothing.
Balthazar was talking to ...
Balthazar is here.
I'll talk to him.
Wait. Are you
making me a fool?
Yes, no.
You get Patrick,
okay?
Alright.
Patrick!
don't be so melodramatic, mother.
It is a real pain.
Of course not.
I never said that.
Looks pretty fun.
But I feel like
a dwarf, otherwise, fine.
Go have fun.
Listen, you are not dwarf, my son.
Right.
Head up.
Body erect.
Chest out.
Morning. Balthazar.
-Yes.
'll Let everyone
you got ...
Marco is ready
to cut your hair.
Excuse me,
where is the hairdresser?
You look at the first
gay and now think ...
he cuts hair?
No, no.
Cool. Have an open mind.
Balthazar. Balthazar.
Here, cutie.
No. This will
haunt me for years.
Balthazar. Simon.
Remember me?
Yes, the Opening.
I thought you will not appear.
But in every case. Very well.
Good job.
I tip my hat to you.
Respect.
An acting class.
She really liked you.
Actually, I want to
apologize personally.
I don't know if Alice mentioned ...
but I was behind
this stupid idea.
How so?
What a stupid idea?
It was a stupid idea.
Now that you know best,
really was a stupid idea.
How stupid?
I will tell you how happened.
There is one
you will shoot.
Is it everything rolling?
This is a Balthazar?
Not won a hello?
Yes, of course.
Good day.
Is there a problem?
-No.
Not?
Shall we begin?
Again.
Miss this face expression
licked by the cow, please.
Drooping eyebrows.
Jennifer, strive a little.
Cathie was the first choice,
recalls.
He has something Tuscan.
Renaissance, I would say.
I'm liking it.
Yes, of course, yes.
Is that good?
-I like it.
Try to be sexy.
Forget it. Try more childish.
Great presence. Photogenic.
He reminds me, I don't know.
The brunette on the right,
do you hear me?
Back on land, please.
Closer to the bubble.
Behind bubble, actually.
Antonela, more
intelligent look, please.
Is she always like that?
Is she normal?
What's the matter, Baltimore?
-Balthazar. Is Balthazar.
What is it?
How about a smile?
Are you okay?
Or are you a tummy ache?
Can you be more polite?
I'm not listening.
Can you be more polite?
-Higher.
I'm asking you to
be more polite.
Stop yelling at people.
It's not right.
Is there a problem?
Yes, believe me.
We have a mini-revolution.
-Patrick, don't be rude.
Just calm down, please.
-I? I calm down?
-Stay calm.
I'm killing myself
grating here.
I've seen zombies more expressive.
The boy in the bubble
summer camp.
Is good enough.
Thank you and goodbye.
Enough. Thank you. Goodbye.
I will get out soon.
How do you open this crap?
Already put up enough of that,
Thank you.
Balthazar.
Balthazar. I'm sorry,
are you okay?
She's a bitch. I should
have warned you about it.
Come on, apologize to her,
to be able to finish.
I apologize?
Kidding.
Never see her again.
So what?
Do it for me,
please.
Why you?
Why did not you say so?
I'm doing it right?
I don't act
since sixth grade.
Come on, you want it.
You want it.
You excite me.
Have you lost your mind?
What are you doing?
-Don't your love my acting?
Of course, compared with yours.
Incredible! Yikes!
I think you deserves the Oscar.
You have my vote.
Sensational performance.
The demure pretending to loving
somenone...
to earn a promotion.
I nominate Alice Lantins!
Come on, ladies and
Gentlemen, cheers!
For all she
has achieved in her career.
So, anything goes for the show?
10 years of work.
Complicity?
The 10 years of our friendship.
I wanted to impress him.
It was stupid idea.
I'm an idiot.
And I ended up hurting everyone.
I'm not deserved the job.
Glad
has said that ...
Because you're fired, Alice.
Farewell.
I'm setting you free.
Now you will have time
to write.
It is your vocation.
Never too late to
find one.
Never too late, Alice.
If you have no where to go tonight
come to our party.
Whiskey, vodka, tequila, some
wines and maybe we can fuck.
Yeah, we can fuck.
Yeah, we can fuck.
Cool, but no thanks.
I'm very tired.
Thank you for the invitation.
-don't worry.
Mom?
What are you doing?
Not working?
No, I thought it's good
to clean the house.
Alright.
You'll have to climb
this vehicle.
The other mission is not to ask
the direction we are going.
The driver has no idea.
And you have to find out.
I think you don't feel well.
No. Of course not.
don't worry;
I'm fine.
Please,
record your message.
Balthazar. Here is Alice.
Just because I called you
I thought maybe ...
could sit for
a coffee ...
tea or soda.
Please, call me.
Your message has been erased.
Please rewrite.
Hi Balthazar, is Alice,
I just wanted to say ...
-Hello.
-Hello.
I know you hate me,
but I need to talk to him.
He is not here today.
Actually, he is in
the area below.
Thank you. Thank you.
You don't even have
personality.
Yes, I do.
Excuse me, you ...
Corridor-A?
-Yes.
-Here.
Thank you.
The traffic was not
so bad, was it?
No, why?
Downstairs, on the left.
Please note, our guest
arrived this week. Silence.
It's a little late,
I regret having to rush it.
Has screens on each side.
The lecture is easy.
Here is everything you need.
But I ...
Ready. Mrs. Bonchevsky.
Lady what?
Good day.
So ...
this is a bold concept ...
improve
urban planning.
Why this theme?
Jean Nouvel, Rem Koolhaas ...
Friedrich and also ...
all shared the
desire to change things.
Sometimes making a
highway under car.
Of course time or another,
these architects ...
These great architects,
make mistakes ...
as well as anyone.
Large errors.
But what if they were all
to fix the error?
Yes?
I mean even something
that is not safe?
What do you mean ...
It is a fair statement.
For example, in 2003
Flosch & Bernheim ...
tried to save the
lighthouse...
with disastrous consequences.
Perhaps they had failed in the plans ...
It has nothing to do with plans.
Are you kidding me -
2 years of research.
Wait. Please ...
6 months to improve
hydraulic pressure.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Sorry, just a minute,
please.
In theory, talk about ruins
is a sign of weakness, right?
In theory, yes.
But I think ...
I fucked up, Balthazar.
Can not get you
from my head.
Those nights we ...
I was not acting.
Wow, that's awesome!
Say something.
Going there with her.
Just a question.
What?
After seeing ourselves
Again, again ...
and again,
what will happen?
Zoe. Zoe.
-That was disgusting.
It's not disgusting.
Have you finished?
Are you finished?
Finished.
Very nervous?
Scared to death.
Shall I go with you?
No, okay,
I'm going there.
don't tell me we
have to start from scratch.
Alice, what are you doing here?
What's up?
Any problems?
-Sit here.
It's the ...
-Will you start reading now?
-Just the beginning.
'' Newton made to discover
the life when ...
apple fell on his head.
With me, it was a whole basket''.
Cool, modest beginning.
Quite modest.
Sorry.
Are you okay?
