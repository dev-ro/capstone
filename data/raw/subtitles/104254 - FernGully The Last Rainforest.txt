Our world was much larger then.
The forest went on for ever.
We tree spirits nurtured
the harmony of all living things.
But our closest friends were humans.
Then, as sometimes happens,
the balance of nature shifted.
And Hexxus, the very spirit of destruction,
rose up from the bowels of the earth
and rained down his poison.
The forest was nearly destroyed.
Many lives were lost and the humans
fled in fear, never to return.
Most think they didn't survive.
It was only by calling up
the magical powers of nature
that I was able to trap Hexxus inside
an enchanted tree and save FernGully.
Which is why it is so important
for you to learn to use these powers.
I won't be around for ever and you have to...
Crysta?
Yes.
That is why it is so important
for you to learn the secrets of...
- Crysta!
- Magi, yes. The secrets.
I know. But, I mean, it's all right now.
That was so long ago and you trapped
him in that tree and everything, so...
I really have to go now.
But I'll see you later, OK? Bye.
- Hey!
- Pips.
You're spending more time
with Magi than you do with me.
Well, what can I learn from you?
Hey!
# When the sleepy planet comes alive
# And I wake up in the warm sunlight
# There's a simple harmony to life
# A magic thing
# Then I walk among the flowers and trees
# It's a magic thing
# And I feel the earth beneath my feet
# It's a magic thing
# And I remember that the air we breathe
# Is a magic thing
# Everybody now
# Life is a magic
# Thing
# Yeah, yeah
# Life is a magic
# Thing
# Yeah, yeah, yeah
# Life is a magic
# Thing
# Yeah, yeah
# Yeah
# Life is a magic
# Thing
# Yeah, yeah, yeah
# Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
There they go. Come on. Don't lose her.
Whoa!
OK.
Crysta, stop!
Never, never go above the canopy.
Never go above the canopy.
Crysta!
Crysta!
I got ya.
Are you crazy, going above the canopy?!
Yeah, we was almost falcon fodder.
- I've got to tell Magi.
- Tell Magi what?
Hey, wait. What... what'd you see...
up there?
- Halt! Who goes there?
- Hi, Crysta.
- OK, what's the password?
- Oh, come on, you guys.
- Is that the password?
- It sounds good.
- Bye.
- "Bye. " That's it. That's the password.
I don't know if it is or not. I'm so confused.
Magi?
Magi?
Oh, Magi. I just saw the most
incredible thing above the canopy.
A whole other world. The sky went on
for ever. And way over in the distance,
as far as I could see,
there was this enormous rock.
- Like a...
- Mountain.
- That was Mount Warning.
- And next to it was a... a... I don't know.
It looked like a strange black cloud
rising out of the earth.
- Smoke, I should think.
- What's smoke?
Oh, there are many things in our world
you don't yet know about, Crysta.
There are worlds within worlds, Crysta.
Everything in our world is connected
by the delicate strands of the web of life,
which is balanced between
forces of destruction
and the magic forces of creation.
Help it grow.
Why can't I do it?
Everyone can call on
the magic powers of the web of life.
You have to find it in yourself.
I want to, Magi. You know I do.
But I was thinking about that smoke.
Do you think it could be... Hexxus?
No, there's no force in nature
that could release him,
and there are no poisons here
on which he can feed.
Hexxus is trapped, for all time.
- Now, that's enough for today.
- But what could have caused the smoke?
- Now, now, now, off with you.
- But, Magi...
Hexxus.
So what'd the Mag have to say, huh?
She said I should get serious.
About time.
And stop hanging around
with bug-brain layabouts like you.
Oh, no!
Red light.
Red light again.
Immediate clearance. Request
immediate clearance. Oh, no!
Crysta!
Hello?
Aaaah!
Bless your heart with magic light.
I give the gift of fairy sight.
Oh, what a strange little bug.
I did it. I did it!
Oh! Gravity works.
Oh, poor guy.
Oh.
Hey, Premier Testing Laboratory.
No! Pass the probe.
- Graduate students, all gather forward. No!
- Love the haircut.
It's all right. We won't hurt you.
- He's still a little confused.
- Clearly.
I'm a nocturnal, flying mammal. A member of
the family of Pterodidae. Or Ptero-didn't-ae!
If you can't tell, I'm a bat!
Yes, I am. And they used
to call me Batty. Batty Koda.
Nice to meet you. Bonjour.
And where are you from?
I just blew in from a biology lab.
I'm back and I'm flapping free.
Let me tell you a story, and it's all about...
# Yo, the name is Batty
# The logic is erratic
# Potato in ajacket
# Toys in the attic
# I rock and I ramble
# My brain is scrambled
# Rap like an animal
# But I'm a mammal
All of our cosmetics are non-carcinogenic.
# I've been brain-fried, electrified,
infected and injectified
# Vivisectified and fed pesticide
# My face is all cut up
cos my radar's all shut up
# Nurse
# I need a checkup from the neck up
# I'm Batty
- It seems to have no effect, Doctor
- Get me another one. Get me another animal.
# They used and abused me
# Battered and bruised me
# Red wires, green wires,
stuck 'em right through me
# So hear my Batty word
and exercise a little prudence
# When dealing with
- Humans.
- Humans?
Where? No, no, no, no, no, no.
Lucy!
- No, no, there are no humans.
- They're long gone.
- Vanished.
- Definitely extinct.
They only exist in stories.
- Excuse me.
- Oh, charming.
It's been lovely, but I gotta hoon.
Adios, amigos. Ting! Check, please.
Oh, father, do you think it's possible?
Could humans still exist?
Now, Crysta,
don't you think you're a little old
to believe in human tales?
Human tails? Humans don't have tails.
They have big, big bottoms
that they wear with bad shorts.
They walk around going "Hi, Helen!"
Did you really see humans?
Were they at Mount Warning?
Oh, masses of homo sapiens.
Hey! Where are you going?
Yeah, this territory looks kinda familiar.
Fabulous day in the canopy, isn't it?
- Now, where do you think you're going?
- Mount Warning.
I know where I am. I know where I am.
Hey! You scared me there.
I thought you said you were
going to Mount Warning.
Well, I did.
But there are humans on Mount Warning!
- Exactly.
- Fractured figs, fairy bug! Come on!
Mount Warning is the last place in
the world a little bug like you wants to go.
Look at these. Do you think nature did this?
Do you think I put this in to get better
reception? No! Humans did this.
We should stay here. It's nice here.
Come on. You got a great set of wings.
Let's just flutter for a while.
- Ooooh!
- Batty?
Batty!
Well, come on.
My heart. Ah! Oh, my heart.
I can't go on. Help me.
My little wings can't make it.
Hm. Maybe you should wait here for me.
It's a fabulous idea. I really
think we should fly with that.
Only, why don't you stay here with me?
It's OK, really. I'll be right back.
Why do I not believe you?
- How you comin' in your quadrant, Pete?
- All done here.
- How about you, Willy?
- Finito, good buddy.
How about you, Zak?
Zak?
Zak? Za-a-a-a-ak?
Yeah, yeah. What's the big deal?
You finished marking those trees yet?
I'm gettin' to it. Don't have a cow. Sheesh.
He's a city kid. Comes
up here for a summerjob.
- He doesn't take it seriously.
- That kid don't belong in the woods.
Freaky.
Ah! Heh, heh, heh. Gotcha.
Hexxus-s-s-s.
Aw, man!
- Huh?
- Look out!
Bless your eyes with magic light.
I give the gift of fairy size. Oh... sight!
No!
Lift. I need lift.
"Don't go" I said. "Bad idea" I said.
But would you listen? No.
Don't listen to Batty. Uh-uh.
Well, what have we here? Shoes.
Animals don't wear shoes. A human!
A tree!
Take anything you want.
I won't tell the cops. Huh?
- Are you all right?
- Ah! I'm fine.
- What is going on here?
- The monster, it tried to eat you.
- Monster?
- My friend and I saved you.
Oh, Batty. Batty?
Oh, sonic interference - what a nightmare.
I thought I saw a human.
Ah! Human!
- That's a human?
- Yes, yes. Kill it. Restrain it. Medicate it.
- Puff up. Puff up. They hate that.
- No.
- Aaah!
- Back. Back. Get back. Don't worry.
- I've got it scared.
- I have but one claw, but beware.
- Will you both just calm down?
- He's trying to kill you!
- I did not. You did!
- Hold on!
The only thing that tried to kill anybody
was that horrible monster in the forest.
Monster? What monster?
The one that ate the tree. It was terrible.
Tree?
The leveller. Hey! Am... am I dead?
- No.
- We could fix that for ya.
- Then I must be dreaming.
- Nope.
Ah, sure. And what are you
supposed to be? Some kind of fairy?
Of course I am. What about you?
Are you really a human?
Last time I checked.
Listen, fairy, it's been weird,
but I'm outta here. This dream is history.
Argh!
Argh!
Ha, ha! Whoo!
Check this out.
# I've a basic inclination
# A very primal need
# To inspect the vegetation
# For an egg or centipede
# I just can't control this hunger
# I just can't seem to cut it back
# For my ravenous consumption
# You're a welcome little snack
# If I'm gonna eat somebody
# It might as well be you
# Can you dig it?
# I can see you as a sandwich
# Or a strange, exotic stew
# Floating down the river
# Like an oyster in a stew
# He's gonna eat somebody
# It might as well be you
# You know it
# Kick it one time
# Welcome to the food chain
No! You can't eat him. He's a human.
Uh... what's a human?
Delicious and nutritious.
Tastes just like chicken.
He's my friend.
Well, any friend of a fairy...
- is a friend of mine.
- Thanks a lot.
Aw, man. You owe me
a free dinner after this one.
- Are you OK?
- Argh! What happened to me?
I'm... I'm three inches tall.
- Oh... I shrank you.
- You what?!
Look, it was the most amazing thing.
It's not what the spell's really supposed
to do. But Magi Lune will fix you.
You... you've shrank me?
- Yeah.
- Catches on quick, doesn't he?
- We better buzz off. It's getting late.
- Buzz off? I'm not buzzing anywhere.
No. Unshrink me. And I mean now!
- Well, I guess I could take a bash at it.
- Take a bash?
- Actually, I'm just sort of learning.
- Great! I've been shrunk by an amateur.
I don't believe this. OK, OK.
Come on. Bash away.
OK.
What was done, now undo.
Return you to the form that's true.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Big ears. Elephant.
No, no, no, no, no. Anteater.
Orang-utan. OK, let me guess again.
Oh, wait. A duck. A duck.
Oh, it's Darwin's grab bag.
- Let me try again.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
No, no, no!
Thank you, but I think maybe
we better go see this Magi.
I'm Zak.
I'm Crysta.
Nice to meet you.
You're going to love FernGully. It's the most
beautiful, wonderful place in the forest.
- Well, come on. Batty can carry you.
- Moi? Uh-uh.
Not this little mammal. Fly a human?
I'd rather suck wax fruit.
- Hey.
- What?
- You see Zak anywhere?
- No. His shift's about over.
- He probably cut out early.
- That's the problem with the world today.
- People are lazy.
- I heard that with my bad ear.
- What is that?
- Hey, Tone.
- You think the leveller can handle this baby?
- Sure. That leveller eats everything.
Kinda like you.
How many times a day
I gotta threaten your life?
Hexxus-s-s-s.
I've got so many things I want to ask you.
Like "Why have humans
returned to the forest?"
And what was that monster
that tried to eat you?
That wasn't a monster.
It was a machine.
- What's a machine?
- It's a... a thing for cutting down trees.
- That's terrible.
- Only if you live in a tree.
- I do live in a tree.
- Oh.
You didn't have anything to do
with that... machine, did you?
Uh... What? Me?
No! No, no, no. Of course not.
Oops. How could I have anything to do
with something that eats trees?
- Could it come to FernGully?
- Oh, no, no. Of course not.
- You've got nothing to worry about.
- Why?
Because... it's trapped.
Oh, I know - by those red marks.
It can't go past them. They must be magic.
Yeah. You know, you're pretty smart, fairy.
I want to learn magic like yours.
Yeah? Uh... Well, here.
Come... come here.
Ah! What is it?
It's fire.
That's fire?
- Ow!
- Careful.
Mm. Delicious.
A first-class smoke.
Mother's milk.
And what is this delightful thing?
And how did I get out of that tree?
Of course. Humans.
What wonderful creatures.
So clever. So helpful.
I must take this wonderful
human thing to... FernGully.
New orders, boys.
You're going to FernGully.
And I want you there by morning.
By mornin'? I don't know if we can do that.
You'll just have to work harder, then.
Double shifts. No breaks-s-s.
- No breaks?
- And make sure ya got plenty of oil.
Roger that. We'll give it a gas.
Hey, Tone, you know what this means?
Yeah.
Beaucoup overtime.
What a miraculous device.
I'm really getting the hang of this.
I do believe we are destined to be soul mates.
# Hit me one time
# Hit me twice
# Oh, ah
# Ohhh
# That's rather nice
# Oil and grime
# Poison sludge
# Diesel clouds and noxious muck
# Slime beneath me
# Mm, slime up above
# Ooh, you'll love my
# Oh, oh, oh
# Toxic love
# I see the world and all the creatures in it
# All the creatures in it
# I suck 'em dry
# And spit 'em out like spinach
# Cos greedy human beings
# Will always lend a hand
# With the destruction
of this worthless jungle land
# And what a beautiful machine
# They have provided
# To slice a path of doom
# With my sweet breath to guide it
Waaah! Ha, ha!
# Filthy brown acid rain
# Pouring down like egg chow mein
# Slime beneath me
# Mm, slime up above
# Ooh, you'll love my
# Oh, oh, oh
# Toxic love
Crysta!
Crysta!
- Any sign of her?
- Ah, let's go back.
- She's probably back home havin' dinner.
- Yeah, she's somebody else's dinner.
She's fine. Now, keep lookin'.
- We're lookin'. We're lookin'.
- Yeah, we're lookin'.
- Look at us look.
- What are we lookin' for?
Oh, look.
Look.
Is that what we're lookin' for?
This is so incredible.
What are the trees like where you live?
Not like this. I live in a city.
- Ciddy?
- Yeah.
Buildings.
Traffic. Roads. Lights.
A city.
Most humans live in cities.
- There's not many trees there.
- But how can you live without trees?
- Easy.
- But trees give life.
- They make the clouds, the rain, the air.
- Oh, we've got air.
Yeah, if you don't mind getting
all your minerals in one breath.
Don't you miss talking to the forest?
Can't say I've actually
talked with a forest before.
- I do all the time.
- Ah! What does it say?
Well, listen.
# It's raining like magic
# It's falling like starlight
# It's raining like magic
# It's raining life
# The forest is breathing
# And ferns are rejoicing
# The trees are all singing
# Hey, it's raining life
# Raining like magic
# La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
# It's raining life
So, what about you, Crysta.
I mean, what do fairies do anyway?
- Do?
- Yeah, I mean, do you have jobs or anything?
What... what's ajob?
I guess that answers that question.
- Look, um, what do you do all day?
- Mm, help things grow.
- Yeah? That sounds cool.
- No, usually it's warm.
- No, no. Cool means hot.
- What?
Yeah. You know, bodacious, bad, tubular.
Awesome use of the language, dude.
As in "You are one bodacious babe. "
And that's good? I mean, cool?
Yeah. We're communicating now.
Tubular.
Morning.
- What are you doing?
- Carving your name.
- See? C-r-y-s...
- No, no. You mustn't do that.
Here.
- Can't you feel its pain?
- Its pain?
Humans can't feel anything.
They're numb from the brain down.
Oh, Zak.
He doesn't understand.
Did I say somethin' wrong?
So, uh, which way to FernGully?
Ha, ha, ha, ha. Isn't this great?
Wow!
- What is this place?
- This is FernGully.
Argh!
Hey, Crysta, what's this?
Careful, Stump. He's a human.
Hey, hey, hey, how does it taste?
Got it.
- A hooman?
- Is this what we're lookin' for?
Yaboshi!
- Crysta!
- Hey! That's my human.
Oh, no!
Ow! Ow! I'm blind. Oh, no!
I can see. It's a miracle.
Another perfect landing.
No worries. I'm OK.
Thank you for caring.
It was just a few bruises.
- Nobody cares about me.
- I do, Batman.
- You sure?
- I'm positive.
- Only fools are positive.
- Are you sure?
I'm positive. I fell for it. I should have known.
Zak.
Crysta, we were so worried about y...
- What's that?
- Father, I'd like you to meet Zak.
- Hi.
- He's a bodacious babe.
- A what?
- He's a human.
Somehow I thought they'd be... bigger.
Well, I had a little accident
and he sort of shrank.
Butjust think - humans, back in the forest.
- Yeah, there goes the neighbourhood.
- Be nice, Batty.
First thing, all these trees go. Then
come your highways, your shopping malls,
your parking lots and your
convenience stores. And then come...
Price check on prune juice, Bob.
Price check on prune juice.
Crysta! Where you been?
I've been looking all over for ya.
Pips, you won't believe what I found.
- Isn't he amazing?
- Should we be charging admission for this?
That's all you got to say? I've been out all
night and you show me this weird creature?
This weird creature is a human.
Hm. He's kinda small, ain't he?
Look out!
- What is it?
- I don't know.
Pips, why don't you tell us
about your strange treasure?
Oh, well, it's simple, really.
It's hard like stone, yet... yet it's hollow.
And, uh, yeah, it has this little
vine coming out of it, and... and...
It's my stereo.
Look, I found it, so I'll explain it, all right?
OK, then what is it?
Well, it's obviously a...
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Obviously it's a...
- It's alive.
- And it's noisy.
It's a recording - of music.
Well, I don't know what a recording is, but
I know what music is, and that is not music.
Come on, everybody! Gather round.
# Nah, na na, na nah
# Na na, na nah, na na, nah, na na, nah
# Na, na, na, nah
# I need somebody to help me. Come on!
# Nah, na na, na nah
# Na na, na nah, na na, nah, na na, nah
Come on. Move. Move. Move.
Move. Move. Get the beat.
# You gotta know how to pony
# Like Bony Moroney
Audio pollution. Oh!
# Do the hot potato
# Do the alligator
# Put your hands on your hips, yeah
# Let your backbone slip
# Do the Watusi
# My little Lucy
# Come on
# Nah, na na, na nah
# Na na, na nah, na na, nah, na na, nah
# Nah, na na, nah
# Nah, na na, na nah
# Na na, na nah, na na, nah, na na, nah
# Nah, na na, nah
# Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
# This song feels good, yeah
# Like I knew it would
# Feel all right
# You know, we're down in the alley
# With Long Tall Sally
# Twisting with Lucy
# Doing the Watusi
# Roll over on your back, yeah
# I like it like that
# Hope you do the jerk
# And then watch me, watch me,
watch me work
Why don't you come with me and the boys?
We'll give you a taste of real wildlife.
Unless, of course, you're not up to it, Zak.
I'm up to anything you can dish out, Bud.
Not now, Pips.
- Nuts.
- Come on, Zak.
Hey! Hey! Where they goin'?
See you around, Zag.
Wow.
# Anytime you want to be right here
# Just imagine me and all this will appear
# You can keep this moment all your life
# For ever near
# A dream worth keeping
# When you're feeling lost
# I'll be your star
# Just reach out and touch me,
no matter where you are
# In a world where precious things
are disappearing overnight
# Just keep my star in sight
# I believe we've found a dream
that's worth keeping
# For more than just today
# And even though the winds of change
may come sweeping
# It's still a dream worth keeping
# So don't let it fade away
# Someday you might be thinking
# That life has passed you by
# Your spirits might be sinking
# With hope in short supply
# And that's the reason why
# That's the reason why
# I know this dream's worth keeping
# As long as it will stay
# Even when you see
the darkness come creeping
# A dream worth keeping
# Will never fade away
Well, I guess I'd better go
find Magi and get you unshrunk.
- There's no hurry.
- No, I promised.
Let it wait till tomorrow. Come here.
No, I've got to tell her about you anyway.
Wait here. I'll be back
as soon as I can find her.
Can't you feel its pain?
Oil.
The leveller.
Oh, no.
Run, little ones. We'll catch up
to you in the FernGully soon enough.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Magi?
Magi?
Oh, Magi, I've got so much to tell you. I went
to Mount Warning and I found a human.
Well, come on. I want you to meet him.
Magi? What's wrong?
Magi, can you heal it?
A force outside of nature did this.
I can't heal it and I can't stop it.
Zak can. I know what did this, Magi.
A monster the humans fight.
Humans can stop it. They have
these magic red marks that...
But Zak said...
Humans did it. Humans did it all.
Crysta!
- Hey! What's going on, Zak?
- What are you talkin' about?
You know exactly what
I'm talking about: The forest.
- You know what's happening, don't you?
- Good idea. Ask the human. He may know.
- Crysta.
- You lied to me.
I... Crysta.
I wish...
I wish the human tales were true.
They're not here to protect the forest.
They're cutting down trees.
They're destroying the forest.
And I was helping them do it.
- Batty was right.
- I was?
They're coming this way.
You can't stop them.
You'll have to leave.
The humans have released Hexxus.
Gather everyone in the circle.
You know, Zak, truth doesn't always win
friends, but it certainly influences people.
You're not half bad for a hominid.
Father?
Since the beginning of time, we have been
the guardians and the healers of the forest.
We have too long forgotten
the magic powers of nature.
The time has come to call on them again.
Remember, all the magic of creation
exists within a single, tiny seed.
We must go to Magi.
Look for the hero inside yourself, Crysta.
Look to the good and loving
heart in you and all others.
Forjust as every seed holds
the power and magic of creation,
so, too, do you and every
other creature in this world.
Magi, don't leave me.
I love you. I'll always be with you.
We all have a power,
and it grows when it is shared.
Remember what you've learned, Crysta.
Oh, Magi.
Ha, ha. I'm back.
Hexxus.
Tony! Ralph! Stop!
Come on.
Hey! It's safer in here.
Coming through!
A fairy fortification.
Crysta, we've got to get everyone out of here.
- No!
- Crysta!
We can't. We've got nowhere else to go.
This is our home.
Zak.
- This is the last time I save you, human.
- No, Batty, take me back to the leveller.
- Are you crazy? That's lemming talk.
- Wrong channel.
Oh, Caesar, Emperor of Rome.
- Wrong channel.
- We're going to war.
Yes, back to the camp. Batty, let's go!
Fasten your seat belts.
It's going to be a bumpy night.
We're goin' in full throttle. That oughta
keep those rebel fighters off our tail.
Lock and load, gentlemen.
Time to rock and roll.
- Tora! Tora! Tora!
- No, no, no. Batty, to the cap, to the cap.
Bogey, bogey at three o'clock.
Red leader, red leader.
Did you see that? It looked
like some kind of flying rat.
Aye aye, Cap'n. I can't get enough speed.
We got no dilithium crystals.
- Oh, no!
- Batty, watch out!
Oh, this is gonna hurt.
Oh, no!
Argh!
Hey, Tone. There's a little man
on the windshield here.
Tony! Ralph! It's me! It's Zak!
- Hey, hey, hey, Tone.
- Keep it moving, boys.
Aarrgghh!
You need a set of your own wings.
Here's your first flyin' lesson, Zak.
Thanks.
I should have sprayed for pests.
Mm! Lovely wings.
So easily detached.
What happened to the energy?
All the magic of creation
exists within a single, tiny seed.
- Crysta!
- No, no.
Come on!
Help it grow!
Come on, guys!
Come on!
- Oh, Crysta's gone.
- I wish she were here with us now.
Oh, look.
We did it, Zak.
Now Hexxus can never harm FernGully again.
But humans still could.
That's why I have to go back.
There's a part of me that really wants to stay.
There's a part of you that will always stay.
Remember, Zak.
Remember everything.
- Keep the stereo, dude.
- Thanks... dude.
- Hey! He's not going already?
- He was a nice guy.
- He just needed wings.
- What was done, now undo.
Return you to the form... that's true.
Bye, Zak.
Oh.
Batty.
Oh! I've shrunk.
- Zak!
- What happened here?
I will remember.
Guys, things have gotta change.
Crysta, help it grow.
Hey! Where are you going?
# You stare through a tunnel of
# Solid wall that should be broken down
# And you can't see the field of green
# Has been turned into a raging battleground
# And you'll live with the consequence
# Tell me, why don't you understand?
# You'll destroy all the love
that's been created
# Be a miser with an empty hand
# And it's all such a simple thing
# Changing everything
# Listen to the one who brings
all this love to you
# Some other world, some other world
# That's where you live
# Some other world, some other world
# That's where you live
# Don't you care?
# Stop and think about us and what you feel
# I'll be there
# Don't you cut yourself off from what is real
# Don't live in some other world
# Ooh-ooh
# You don't live in
# Some other world
# Ooh-ooh
# There's a boat bound for paradise
# If you hurry you can ride it back
# Cos once the bait hits the water
# It don't take long till the sharks attack
# Oh, but it's all such a simple thing
# Changes everything
# Let me be the one
who brings all this love to you
# Some other world, some other world
# That's where you live
# Some other world, some other world
# That's where you live
# Don't you care?
# Stop and think about us and what you feel
# I'll be there
# Don't cut yourself off from what is real
# Don't live in some other world
# In some other world
# Oh, you don't live in
# Some other world
# In some other world
# Got to stop living in some other world
# Let me help you with a change of mind
# And it's all such a simple thing
# Changing everything
# Listen to the one who brings
all this love to you
# Some other world, some other world
# That's where you live
# Some other world, some other world
# That's where you live
# Don't you care?
# Stop to think about us and what you feel
# I'll be there
# Don't cut yourself off from what is real
# Don't live in
# Some other world
# Ooh-ooh
# You don't live in
# Some other world
# Ooh-ooh
# Some other world
# This is our world
# Not some other world
# You don't live in
# Some other world
# This is our world
# Not some other world
# You don't live in
# Some other world
# This is our world
# Not some other world
# Some other world
# Ooh-ooh
# Some other world
# Some other world
# Ooh-ooh
# Some other world
# Ooh-ooh
# Some other world
# Some other world
# Ooh-ooh
# Some other world
# Ooh-ooh
# Some other world
