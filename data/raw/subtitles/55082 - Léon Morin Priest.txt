It was around eight o'clock
in the evening
returning from a neighbouring
village i was surprised to see...
...a group of strange young men
looking at passers-by in the park
they wore amusing little hats
topped by a long feather
a group of travelling players, i'd
have said, until i saw the weapons
our town was occupied by
italian soldiers
their occupation did not seem
to weigh too heavily
only the censorship reminded us
of a war grown distant
i worked for a correspondence school
relocated here, correcting essays
monsieur edelman was a philosophy
professor, also washed up here by war
i liked sabine lévy...
...the director's personal assistant
seeing her, i took wing
through time and space
handsome beings, i felt, should
have the right to command
i took a keen pleasure...
...in crossing ocular swords
with her, until...
...unable to sustain it any longer...
...i had to lower my eyes,
delighting in her victory
she reminds me of those handsome
youths in the scriptures...
...loins girt, wielding a
traveller's staff...
...a sword or a rod,
and who are angels
she's like an amazon, like pallas...
...like a samurai
when she leans over me as i work, it
feels as if she's a sheltering palm
in other words, you want to
sleep with her
how horrible!
No, sabine fascinates me because
she's like a young man...
...but gifted with singular charms,
virility tinged with femininity
everything about her charmed me...
...her wide-ranging intelligence,
her strange beauty
i felt bound to her by ties
stronger than those of coition
the papers say germans are
to occupy the town
if we give them the glad eye,
we won't get shot
i'd rather get shot
they'll be belated baptisms,
that's all
lucienne, jenny and i decided
to have our children baptised...
...as they were half-jewish or
descended from communists
we can alter the dates
on the certificates
- what about godfathers and mothers?
- Yes, that's more difficult
what we'll have to do is this
i'll be godmother to
your daughter france
barny, you'll be godmother to
my daughter and jenny's son
jenny's husband will be godfather to
both my daughter and your france
i'll be godmother to jenny's daughter
your two will have to do without a
godfather. We'll make notes of this
quiet, or i'll sell you to
the rabbit-skin man!
Give me a hand, barny;
clean her slippers
- no brush? Haven't you a cloth?
- Never mind, just use the curtain
we mustn't keep the curé waiting.
Pierre's already there with emile
don't bust your heads; at least,
not till afterwards
receive the salt of wisdom,
in earnest of eternal life
- it's horrible!
- That's the war for you
you're sure he won't ring the bells?
The quartet emerged from
the dark church...
...christened by the grace of god
and the germans
the partisans embraced
their families
then headed back to the woods
i find these believers and
their priests a challenge
they live off funds they hold in trust
i want to say what i think.
Know what i'll do?
I focused my attention on
the church of saint-bernard
not the oldest priest, who was not
likely to respond to healthy ribbing
there were two curates
philippe demanoir
and léon morin
i had only the names
to guide my choice
philippe's family must have been
bourgeois
léon's, picking a name like that,
were probably peasants
so have at you, léon morin!
I was afraid, but couldn't back out
morin was scheduled to officiate
at 5.30 p.m.
Religion is the opium of the people
not exactly. The bourgeoisie made it
so, distorting it to their advantage
but you let them do it, and now
you're hand-in-glove with them
the church lost the working classes,
it's true; but we are reacting
attending communion adds to the
resolve of a striker...
...from the young workers'
catholic association
injustice is an abomination
to the christian heart
even if religion had remained pure...
...that still wouldn't prove
it held the truth
of course not
- it's good of you to have come
- good? I'm here as an enemy
i don't think so
is it long since you last confessed?
Since my first communion...
not that i'm confessing
i know acknowledging one's faults
isn't easy
i don't believe in god,
so that's irrelevant
are you sure? Do you never pray?
Only unawares, a leftover habit
from childhood, a weakness
you are proud, aren't you?
Do you sometimes lie?
- Have you ever stolen? What was it?
- Food
do you sometimes give way to anger?
- Do you sin against purity?
- I don't know
- will you deprive yourself for others?
- Only for my daughter
- do you fulfil duties to the state?
- More or less
are you realizing your capacities
to their maximum potential?
Saint paul said the world would be
better if you were
you've made a good confession;
now ask for forgiveness
who from?
From..."x"
we'll stay like this until
the end of the world
you've no backbone
shall i give you a penitence?
Yes, it will be good for you
on leaving the confessional,
go and kneel...
- on one of the velvet chairs?
- No, on the flagstones
it will be hard on your knees. There
you will pray however you think fit
i'm not a believer, so any pseudo-
praying would be derisory
our prayers are always derisory,
being so far beneath him we address
but when the person saying them
does so seriously, in full belief?
Is the effort less worthy
than the belief?
I feel no remorse
i should hope not. Judas had remorse,
and he hanged himself
it is repentance, the opposite of
remorse, that is expected of us
i could repent only if i had elected
to live by christian moral standards
even if you do not make such a choice,
you live in a christianized world
you know it if you sin against the
collective conscience
are you always pleased with yourself?
No, but my behaviour is determined by
heredity, associations, circumstances
you're a robot, then? Bow your head
so that i may give you absolution
easy to manage, aren't i?
Moderately
i absolve you of your sins...
...in the name of the father,
the son and the holy spirit
may the passion of our lord
jesus christ...
...the righteousness of the blessed
virgin mary and of all the saints...
...all the good you have done
and all your sufferings...
...aid in the remittance of
your sins...
...the acquisition of grace and the
conquest of eternal life. So be it
should i lend you some books?
The presbytery is opposite the
moderne cinema. When could you come?
Only in the evenings
how about wednesday at 8.30?
Third floor
abbé morin, you won't forget?
Go now
i remembered then the pain
i had suffered
i walked in joy, light, airy
and fragile
because my thoughts ran so free,
or because i had been absolved?
On wednesday evening i walked across
town, stopping to look in windows...
...taking short cuts,
making detours...
...but arriving at the
appointed time...
...at the alleyway which separated
the presbytery from the church
how have things been going
since we met?
Was the road to saint-bernard
a hard one?
No, but i'll never again enter
a church, except as a tourist
- all of us are tourists in a way
- no, the gilding scandalizes some
me, too; the fire is the best place
for all the rich trappings
- you say that, a priest?
- You think priests like the trappings?
They help them to survive
not all of us. Some fight; it's hard,
but we have made some progress
here, for example, we've only
one class of funeral
before, sometimes three priests
buried someone. What's the point?
It's not a sacrament,
it's just a rite
we aren't undertakers;
we're there for the living
if that's your progress, reducing the
number of priests from three to one...
we also did away with collections
money is always a church problem, so
poor people feel they can't attend
yes, but that's to do with the
non-application of christ's teaching
the prime question is:
Is his teaching valid?
- How do you see christ?
- I've read the gospels, of course
- and renan
- is that all?
Well, giovanni papini's
story of christ
no great shakes, papini
jesus christ, by karl adam, tubingen
university professor, no less
take this book with you. Can you
come again on friday evening?
I'll never have finished the book
by then
we can meet anyway
trying to convert me?
Only you and our lord can manage that
- why lend me books, then?
- Wouldn't you, in my position?
I don't know. But why do you
want me to come back?
Don't you want to exchange ideas with
people like yourself... wild cat?
That was mostly on monday. I'm sorry,
i don't know what got into me
no, no, it was fun
good-bye, till friday
he comes on like a militant:
Citizen, priest, comrade, abbé
he must be doing that deliberately
to disconcert me
finished already? You read it
much too quickly
once i'd started, i couldn't
put it down
from your catholic standpoint, i'm
done for if i continue as an atheist?
No, you're not done for, even if
you continue to live as an atheist
but there's no salvation
outside the church
what matters is the invisible church,
which is greater than the visible one
what is the invisible church?
Humanity of great goodwill
what a mess. People don't bring books
back, and i've no time to sort them
- it's strange, i chanced on you
- it was providential
why should i choose your books?
Come and take whatever you fancy
take it
let me see
of course! I don't know if i'm
doing you a favour, lending you this
you're full of quibbles anyway
well, if it's what you want
- nothing else?
- I haven't too much time
what did you think of
the karl adam book?
Powerful and original. It made me
believe in god while i was reading it
a feeling you soon got over, luckily
how can i believe without proof?
There doesn't have to be any proof
belief in god is not cerebral, a
scientific idea, as you seem to think
belief in god is an acceptance by
every particle of your being
if you fall in love, you do so without
proof. Faith likewise: Moral certainty
plenty of religious books list so-
called proofs of god's existence
those are merely guides to help us
along part of the way
there's always a precipice
one must negotiate alone
if there were proofs,
everyone would believe
there wouldn't even be any need for
belief; you'd know, understand, see
it wouldn't be faith down here,
it would be heaven
i'm going to draw your portrait
that's you
now i'll draw god
the dot tries to contain the circle,
but it's not possible, as you see
the dot should be in the circle,
and not try to reverse the roles
what is the circle waiting for?
For you to move. If god forced our
allegiance, we'd no longer be free
your comparison between loving god and
loving someone isn't quite appropriate
you love someone without proofs, but
you have proof the loved one exists
you seem always to be wondering
whether god exists or not
god doesn't have existence;
god is existence
as jehovah says, "i am he who is"
that's a bit like saying x equals x
what i was left considering,
after i finished the book...
...was whether this existence of god
is a personal existence
do you find human beings to be
endowed with personality?
Where can this personality come from
unless from a higher personality?
Not necessarily
we could have a progression from
earlier, undifferentiated species
where does the power to progress come
from? Can the lesser drive the greater?
All this is academic
maybe the lesser could
drive the greater
so you believe in spontaneous
generation?
Of course you, father, have all the
arguments at hand to make me believe
but an atheist would marshal opposing
arguments of equal force
probably. We shouldn't be chatting
like this; words are of little use
god is above all a reality
we experience individually...
...different for each of us
and incommunicable
incommunicable?
How dreadful
why? What difference does it make to
you whether god exists or doesn't?
What difference?
It was the only thing that mattered
to me in my philosophy class
- i considered suicide because of him
- very imaginative
these conversation with morin,
one or more evenings a week...
...became part of my life
i felt at home, as i never had
anywhere before...
...in that parlour with its polished
floor and air of a disused laundry
the italians fought all night, they
refused to submit to german orders
they gave in only after their
ammunition ran out
alas, we won't see more of those
strolling players and their plumes
the germans are making a show of
disinfecting territory they occupy...
...as though to establish their
difference from their allies
deportations began
today i had to go to the kommandantur.
It's my name, holdenberg. I'm alsatian
they said: Aren't you jewish?
I assured them i wasn't
- but how can one be sure?
- Lf you were baptized, you aren't
- but protestants aren't baptized
- yes, they are
- jews don't belong to the french race
- there is no french race
with all our scholars and inventors?
When france speaks, the world listens
that evening i stayed on late
to correct some exercises
the offices are closed, sir.
If you want to see the director...
no, my dear colleague,
it is you i came to see
i just wanted to say good-bye.
I'm going away, leaving you
you're monsieur edelman
don't know him... don't know him
any more
edelman has become georges mauchamps
once so sad, the grey eyes of
the old philosophy professor...
...gleamed with the light
of adventure
it's gone on for too long
and i've had enough
if my husband doesn't escape,
that's too bad
take these exercises to
professor dumas
- can you give me the address, madame?
- No, find it for yourself
they must go tonight
had servants at your beck and call,
had you?
She's sex-starved and ashamed because
her mother's a concierge
what did you say?
I could understand if you got angry,
but motiveless malice is beyond me
who says malice is easier to resist
than anger?
Did you know that an aryan woman
like you, widow of a jew...
...had two kids seized by the gestapo?
I'd say that my husband
wasn't france's father
i'd invent an aryan father, one she
resembles slightly, who won't deny it
that was some slap, i can tell you.
I saw stars
that barny... when she gets going!
I decided to entrust dimitri to the
farmers who looked after my daughter
they're asking for papers
we'll go across the fields, it'll be
more fun. Pick grass for the rabits
this is dimitri. He'll stay, so you
will have a friend to play with
why aren't you being nice to him?
I've got a friend... titi serpolet;
he looks after five cows
- why are your white shoes black now?
- She got them in an awful mess
- they should have been cleaned
- the black was her idea
- why, if you please?
- Because my daddy is dead
what are you doing here?
Christine's face bore no trace
of make-up
the jewelled earrings had gone
from her shapely ears
you're not made-up any more?
- No, i removed it
- why?
I'm going to see my spiritual
adviser
not léon morin?
Monsieur i'abbé morin.
And what are you doing here?
The same as you; but you go ahead
wait, don't go!
It's funny that we never met there
when i went to see him, i thought:
At last i've found what i want
- you don't live around there
- no, daniéle holdenberg took me
yes, i remember her saying she
sometimes went to see a priest
he can be tough with me.
I sometimes want to slap him
you and daniéle are both catholics?
With a difference. For her, religion
is like the history of france
but with me, it runs in
my family's blood
did monsieur i'abbé say anything
to you about me?
He said you were a strange girl
is that all?
I shouldn't tell, but he said "she is
closer to god than my parishioners are"
madame sangredin told you?
Yes, with manual illustrations
unsure whether he blamed me for the
slap or the caress on the stairs...
...i temporized
i'm in love with a girl
no sooner spoken than this
dead fact revived
i was gripped by the thought
of sabine
the men in your age group are away
you are in my age group
it's not the same for me...
that's something else
a girl you work with?
Yes. She's beautiful and intelligent;
runs the whole thing
she's like a ray of dark light.
Her name is sabine
why not bring her here?
She'd never come. I'm her subordinate
besides, i don't love her
like i used to
you've never loved, don't know what
it means. You're turned in on yourself
hearing that, i can't help feeling
a rush of joy
not knowing whether the resistance
is responsible...
...or whether a lot of people are
dying, i am filled with joy
whenever trouble starts, i want to be
there, purely for the pleasure of it
i'm exactly the same. We're all a
poor lot with a taste for destruction
human nature is corrupt,
and we have to put up with it
besides, this war has changed our
lives. People stream through my room...
...sleep in my bed
- what people?
- Jews, of course
you take in one and others come. We
mass produce certificates of baptism
i get into trouble with the diocese
madame lathuille couldn't
keep france now...
...so i decided to have her with me
until i could place her elsewhere
one day she came home
from school beaming
now i know everything. We were
told it all and i understood
now i know who made me
- who?
- God!
- Who told you that?
- The gentleman... monsieur i'abbé
- where?
- At catechism... in the church
- you went to church?
- Not me... lucida trivoli took me
they gave me this little book. They
can get a bread roll without coupons
now i know god
- you didn't see him
- he has no body, but it doesn't matter
lucienne bernhadt introduced me to
reine and aimée plantain...
...two old maids anxious to have a
child live in their country home
when i was young i had lovely hair,
a misfortune for a worker's daughter
my sweetheart's mother prevented our
marriage, because of my low status
he died from the spanish flu,
so she lost him, too
- please take those off
- why?
I have to see people's eyes.
I hate any barriers
church pillars, for instance, prevent
worshippers from seeing the altar
and all that darkness is dreadful
we need vast, ultra-modern churches
bathed in sunlight
religious skyscrapers
no, but a cathedral all in glass
would be nice, wouldn't it?
Probably someone who thinks the
presbytery is a bed-sitter
just put it on the billiard-table
who's that?
I've no idea
what does the abbé think of
your vichyism?
He says he'll help me if they put me
against a wall after the liberation
what happened to your hair?
He threatened to refuse me absolution
if i went on dying it
he knows exactly what it costs. One
of his penitants must be a hairdresser
he advized me to imitate "the
simplicity of communist women"
i twigged right away that by
communist women he meant you
he's completely sovietized;
you've done a great job there
no, he's communizing me
i told him my mother accused
young communists...
...of committing themselves
before they were mature
"they're right" he said. "committing
yourself achieves maturity"
in a meadow beside the house where
the plantain sisters lived...
...german recruits were put through
training exercises every day
have you been good?
Long have i loved you,
never will i forget you
will you be here always?
No, we're being relieved
and sent to russia
i did so want you to stay for always
- she's not too much trouble?
- No, she's a very good little girl
i hope you work hard at school
oh yes; our teacher died, though. But
it's all right, we got a new one
when you die, what should i plant
on your grave?
Nothing expensive, because i'll
need my money for my children
who gave you this bracelet?
It was my friend günther
a very nice boche i'm in love with
summer came
the germans had imposed an 8 o'clock
curfew for an indefinite period...
...so i couldn't go to morin,
and i had books to return
i took a chance and went there
one saturday morning
monsieur i'abbé, will there be
salutation of the blessed sacrament?
Here's the key; i'll see you up there
i was surprised by his behaviour
in the presence of such people
i'd never seen anyone so careless
of what people might say
here, i kept it for you
you won't take anything from anyone?
But i do; i accept this gift
of your time
gift? So you do; all right,
eat this pear, then
pure pride; you're more middle-class
than the middle-classes you despise
all right, i'll give it to someone
less foolish. Life should be simple
- are you simple?
- I don't know. I give that impression?
You don't give me any impression
are you simple, monsieur i'abbé?
Yes, i think so
- what do you think of me?
- Nothing
that's not possible
i make no judgement; no one will
ask me how worthy you are
but i'm here, right in front of you.
I must have some effect on you
your effect on me is that of
an embryo
you accuse me of pride. Why is it
so bad to be proud?
- It shows lack of personal respect
- it shows the great respect one has
- self-deception
- how so?
Assuming more importance
then you have
the angelus rang out
he'll have to pose like millet's
painting or ignore the call...
...and look either ridiculous
or inadequate
do you know the angelus?
The angel tells mary she has
conceived through the holy spirit...
...and will become the mother of god
the word is become flesh
and lives among us
holy mother of god, pray for us
and you, if you weren't above
such things, would say:
"That we may be made worthy of
the teachings of jesus christ"
you should paint your toenails
you need a husband
never mind, i do it with
a bit of stick
- you could hurt yourself
- that doesn't scare me
during these silences, are you asking
the holy spirit to help you out?
My poor little chatterbox,
how you do trifle with words
you didn't answer me. Are your
silences asides to the holy spirit?
When i talked like that as a boy, i
was sent to the hayloft to talk
why am i horrible to you?
It's how you are. It will pass
i'll go
not taking a book today?
No hard feelings?
What's wrong, sabine?
What's happened?
My mother wrote that my brother's
been arrested by the gestapo
she had a letter from him saying
he was being sent to germany
he signed off with the words,
"long live france"
they heard nothing more of him
sabine ran the office as usual
increasingly racked, her face
lost most of its beauty
type this up in three copies,
to be signed by the director
within a few weeks she had aged
several years
please do come in, madame
where were we, my church sparrow?
I think what repels me about
christianity is its self-interest
you do or don't do things to ensure
your claim to paradise
so if a seed is sown in you,
you don't want it to grow?
Heaven grows from a grain
remember our lord and
the mustard seed?
- Your lord
- he is yours as much as mine
not if i refuse
you can refuse to have the earth go
round; it won't make much difference
i'm unhappier than ever since i
talked to you of what interests me
i can't not read the books you lend
me, though they upset me
they wear me out
i'm tormented, harried, persecuted
i feel i should never come to see
you again, but i can't help myself
grace at work, we call that
at night i thought, ; belief in god
makes a nice ladder of the universe
but discussions with morin
are disconcerting
i charge on, only to find
the obstacle gone
still buoyed by impulse i fall,
and no longer know where i am
i am lost, without an adversary.
Morin is faultless to my eyes
part of my loft was strewn
with rubble
i decided to spend whit monday
throwing it out
it was then that disaster struck
monsieur i'abbé, i've something
to tell you
i am on fire
i am converted. I am at your command
what has happened?
Nothing. I am returning to catholicism
- why?
- I am cornered; i give in
maybe you're tired, or undernourished
these days
i am not tired, and we just had
an issue of potatoes
why do you wish to convert?
I don't want to, i have to
- what does conversion mean to you?
- Starting to follow christ's precepts
what precepts?
To be always poor,
to start loving people...
...to help them as best one can,
renouncing one's own interests...
...to pray to god, to receive
the sacraments...
...to be received within the church
think before you make a decision
affecting your whole life
it isn't my decision;
i have no choice
you only think you have no choice
because of your tense, exalted state
oh no; i was quite calm,
all alone in the loft
- what happened in the loft?
- Nothing happened at all
on the contrary, everything stopped
- how do you mean?
- Like when the arsenal blew up
this girl is crazy
- this is happening against my will
- so it's a possession i must exorcise?
Monsieur i'abbé, you tried your
hardest to make a christian of me...
...yet now you discourage me from
following your lord
why should you follow him?
Because his teachings may not
have been wrong
you'll blight your existence,
ruin your whole life
you're obviously saying that
to test me
but i already know that after this,
nothing worse could happen to me
have you thought of being protestant?
They number many fine people
why must you mock me so,
monsieur i'abbé?
I'm not mocking, just facing facts.
So what to do?
Before receiving communion, i must
confess. At my parish church?
- No, you can come to saint-bernard
- would it be you who...
yes, it's best since we
know each other
mondays, wednesdays, fridays,
saturdays, 5.30 to 7.00, 7.30 to 8.00
or before morning mass
i'll come tomorrow night
all right; if you change your mind,
it doesn't matter
now i've seen everything
- good day, barny
- oh, no
- why so impressed?
- Through vanity
it will pass, you'll see. It's
nothing at all. Repeat after me
lord, lighten my conscience, that i
may know my trespasses against you...
...and atone for them through humble
confession...
...true contrition and
sincere penitence
lord, lighten my conscience that i
know my trespasses against you...
and atone for them through
humble confession...
- do i absolutely have to repeat that?
- Yes, but no hurry; take your time
- and atone for them...
- through humble confession...
through humble confession, true
contrition and sincere penitence
your spirit filled with goodness
will lead me to the right path
lord, you will instill me
with your justice
your hands are pure?
Your body is a temple of
the holy spirit
you must have great respect for it
don't you wonder at the
human organism?
You shouldn't abuse it, then.
Will you eschew vicious practices?
Are you pleasant in your office?
The others hate me because
i'm a convert
do you love them?
I can't. I adore god, if he exists,
becaust he's perfect. But not them
john says that he who claims to love
god, but not his neighbour, is a liar
is anything else amiss?
When i first came here, i lied to
myself in thinking it was in mockery
i think i'd been play-acting for
months, that i was running away
that's known as resistance to grace.
Is that all?
For these faults, simply
repeat this once:
Lord, let me love my neighbour
as myself, for love of you
the lightness of this penitence
distressed me
- you must start going to catechism
- i've been going for a long time
why didn't you tell me?
You wouldn't have liked it
- why didn't the plantains tell me?
- Oh, they don't know
- when do you go?
- After school
- don't they worry when you're late?
- They think i've been kept in
- it's nice that you're back
- i'm suffering terribly
lmagine a snail stripped of its
shell, but still alive...
...covered with wounds it drags
through the rocks and filth
"the sun will heal all wounds"
how can you, so capable of true
fellow-feeling, be a collaborator?
France can't survive in any other way
even if that's true, even if the
resistance is doomed to failure...
...even if collaboration is france's
only path to survival...
...as a christian you've no right
to take it
and why not?
Better france dead than in mortal sin
france isn't in a state of mortal sin
because it condones collaboration
yes it is, because it lets innocent
people be deported or killed...
...like sabine's brother, for
instance, one of many
all resistance gets you is reprisals
so you, a catholic, would let my
daughter be deported...
...so yours can have milk?
So we must sacrifice loved ones
to no end?
Deportees are your people, too
not the jews
oh yes, our lord is a jew
what i want is to get married
i'm preparing a trousseau...
...with front-buttoning undergarments
to facilitate suckling
the awful thing is that boys
will follow me in the street
let me introduce you to someone
who might help you
he's a priest, interested in
young people
- is he young? How old?
- The same age as me
- when could we go?
- Tomorrow, for instance?
He's good-looking
now that arlette said it, i realized
that morin was indeed good-looking
i wondered vaguely if it was a sin,
pleasure in my confessor's looks
but no, i reassured myself,
what could the harm be?
Jesus was handsome,
the gospel tells us
beauty is a gift from god
thank you, lord, for the perfection
of your servant, morin
arlette already seemed less flighty
transmission of his thoughts made
morin's visitors seem akin to him
i don't often go to communion.
I take little delight in it
do you think i do? Don't ask more of
communion than what it must offer
i have shopping to do.
I must leave you
did you see? The hotel clarmont
blown up
didn't you see? I thought
it was on your way
you walked through the ruins without
noticing the clarmont had gone?
No, i didn't notice
- something's very wrong there
- i've always been absent-minded
all right, but not that absent-minded
what does it matter? What troubles
you so, monsieur i'abbé?
It's no sin not to have noticed
a blown-up hotel
sin or no sin, something is amiss
returning home, i again crossed the
square where the clarmont had stood
my recent blindness troubled me
i'm seeing morin next saturday. He
gave me a book to do a resumé of
when we parted, he said:
"Good-bye, little butterfly"
what book?
It's hard going, i don't understand
it. "the glorious rise of faith"
if i can't finish it, i won't dare
go back there again
a friend needs you, monsieur i'abbé.
Marion lamiral, she's being divorced
she is keeping up the morale
of five lovers
two militiamen, a resistance man, a
black marketeer, and now a german
as a bank employee she lacks time to
serve resistance, vichy and germany
her appointment book's a mess and
she's taken to trafficking in gold
i would indeed like to meet
this interesting person
monsieur i'abbé, may i introduce
marion lamiral?
An earring is missing
yes... i forgot to put it back
after telephoning
- how old are you?
- Twenty-six also
i thought so; we were in the same
class at school. What do you do?
All sorts of things
- for instance?
- For instance, i'm getting divorced
why, may i ask?
He doesn't want me any more.
He has good reasons for that
the abbé went to see marion's husband.
To ask him to take her back
did he agree?
Not at all! The abbé was lucky
to get a civil welcome
one thing, though. She's fallen for
the abbé; she says she'll have him
- can you understand such a thing?
- Not as far as i'm concerned
i couldn't ever forget that a priest
is consecrated in holy orders
but sacrilege doesn't bother marion.
She sees a man, and she wants him
she really thinks she can get him?
She's sure of it; says she's never
known disappointment in that area
you should become a country priest
i'd be your housekeeper
that's an idea; but a priest's
housekeeper must be old and ugly
in a few years time
it might be possible
i want to look on you
with loving eyes
- they will never seem loving to me
- because it is forbidden to you?
I'm afraid your eyes aren't
a very pleasant sight
not enough mascara? I'll use more
next time
what's it to be like when
you've enough?
Poor bird-brain, perhaps by next
time you'll have got things settled
my dear child, christ is filled
with love for you
you are among his favourites. I think
heaven is designed specially for you
beloved lord...
...permit me to pray like marion,
and with marion
marion of the gold, marion of the
five lovers, enters the confessional
i saw marion at saint-bernard.
She made confession
typically, that's where it ends
she left town yesterday
with a new protector
would you mind hurrying up a bit?
Forgotten how to walk?
Last night someone fired from the
bell-tower, towards the hotel...
...now occupied by the militia
and their families
about one, someone yelled from the
street: "father, come down quickly!"
I took my time about it.
The bell-tower was lit up
i had to open the church
and we climbed up
what happened to the men shooting?
Flown away
monsieur i'abbé, what i don't
understand is how...
...jesus came to die abandoned by god
what's that you say?
My god, my god, why hast thou
forsaken me?
No, no. Being a jew,
jesus died as a jew...
...and quoted psalm 22, which is
a jewish prayer
my god, my god, why has thou
forsaken me?
Why art thou so far from helping me
and from the words of my roaring?
And it ends with a homage to god
for the kingdom is jehovah's and
he is the governor among nations
jehovah, god of jews and christians
it's absurd that i have to think
about that so as not to forget it
not only you. Jesus didn't pick
psalm 22 at random
he chose it because it applies
specifically to him
they pierced my hands and my feet
they parted my garments
amongst them
don't forget the old testament is a
jewish book, which the messiah knew
jehovah chose a christ of flesh and
blood and he was granted youth
he chose to die in the prime of life...
...so that preserved by this
rejuvenation, god will never die
i think my irritation with old
ladies mouthing paternosters...
...and old men blocking progress
in the church...
...is indeed a specifically
christian irritation
crossing is strictly forbidden!
You know about sabotage!
It is written in french:
"Crossing forbidden"
i never saw it
suddenly the atmosphere changed
what's this little boy up to?
Go to hell!
Not nice... not nice
no shoes until the town is liberated
one morning the town woke up free
the germans had left, their great
war machine doing a midnight flit
- they're sure to shoot me
- maybe not
please collect your daughter at once.
She's destructive, she wears us out
you didn't have to come to town for
that. I wanted to collect her, anyway
we wanted to see the shorn women
paraded. So we came here afterwards
my bike had been stolen, so i
had to collect france on foot
i tried to cry, hoping he'd relent
he wants to kill you?
I can't leave my daughter all alone,
so won't be coming here
then we won't see each other?
Could i come to you? Would you mind?
I don't know when i'll be free,
but one of these days
you know gym well!
We learn lots of things at
the seminary, even boxing
back to bed, or you'll catch cold
i had never spoken of him to my
daughter, or mentioned his visit
i was greatly surprised
to see her behave like that
first steps towards jesus
- well, if you were my daughter...
- i wish i was
i don't know if it's the effects of
first steps, but she's now impossible
when i correct her, she says:
"You see the mote but not the beam"
when i threaten her with hell, it's:
"Hell is for grown-ups, not children"
i gave her a real smacking
you're right to discipline her, but
be careful not to go too far
i got thrashed as a kid,
more often than i deserved
sent to bed without supper
half the time
why was your father so harsh?
Why was your father so harsh?
It wasn't my father; he never
touched me. It was my mother
why did she beat you?
If i was late home from school, i'd
get hit on the calves with a stick
i'd grit my teeth
being late wasn't your fault
it was; we'd fight all the six
kilometres home from school
- she beat you just for that?
- I also told a lot of lies
because you were afraid of her?
Did she also beat your sisters?
No, my sisters stuck to
the straight and narrow
- your mother was too harsh
- she thought she was doing right
so you didn't have a happy childhood
of course i did, silly,
don't look so surprised
i didn't get whacked every day,
you know
what made your childhood happy?
The atmosphere... it was nice at home
what was it like at your home?
We woke at six in the morning,
left at seven
sundays my father tended the goats,
taking several newspapers with him
mother said that once, going to
church, my father saw a hare
he thought no, if i go home for my
gun i'll be late for mass
when he came back after mass,
the hare was still there
he went for his gun, fired,
and got it
- your mother... any resentment?
- Yes, i felt resentment
- throughout your seminary days?
- Only as long as the pain lasted
how old were you when you
entered the seminary?
I entered the junior seminary
at twelve
how come you wanted to be a priest,
being pretty much of a bad boy?
That doesn't come into it
you want to be a priest
to save souls, that's all
even a bad boy can have
an idea like that
your mother was harsher than most,
but you were a child like any other
rather worse than most
i once broke a cow's leg,
making it jump a fence
needless to say, the owner
well and truly tanned my hide
that didn't change you. You're still
trying to get ruminants to fly
it's what i'm here for
you'll be breaking another leg
never mind, if it's in trying
brethren, is it the cold
that makes you sluggish?
I hope the sunny weather
will bring you to life
some busily tell their beads at mass,
though it is hardly the right moment
others pray before a statue...
...meanwhile...
...the holy sacrament awaits,
alive and present
and everyone leaves before
the final gospel
are you so anxious to leave your god,
you sunday christians?
Let us not live like those disciples
who pressed so closely upon our lord...
...almost stifling him and preventing
others seeing him or drawing close
if you are christian only in name...
...you discourage the hesitant
from joining us...
...whereas each of you...
...should be an apostle
let us sing mass with more vigour,
less faltering in the final stages
two things i am absolutely certain
of, yet they are contradictory
the abbé is the most spiritually
elevated person i have ever known
and on sunday, without a
shadow of doubt...
...his passing so close that his
sleeve brushed me was deliberate
you can guess how i felt
he does such things sometimes. Hardly
surprising that he got told off
do you think he's just teasing in
doing such things, having fun?
It must be what's called the glorious
freedom of the children of god
"love, and do as you wish".
But it destroys me
he's being stimulating. It's
dangerous, but he's afraid of nothing
it was at night...
forgive me, o lord. Watch over
my thoughts
let me not offend you,
even in my dreams
to use when there's no electricity.
It's a funeral candle
- what were you doing?
- Chopping wood
- i'll chop some for you
- no, not you
jeanne the axe
have you any wire?
If you were a protestant clergyman,
would you marry me?
Of course
i'm serious in asking you that.
I need to know
if you weren't a priest, would you
take me as your wife?
A hand, in a single gesture,
had taken everything from me
i didn't see him again
for a long time
one sunday, walking in the hills,
seeing the town spread out below...
...with its pink and red roofs...
...i couldn't stop staring
at a bell-tower
i was thinking that he would
be there right now...
...and since it was time for
vespers, that he would be singing
i've brought some books for daniéle
christine tells me you'll visit her
at the sanatorium
there's one for you. "traditional
dogmatism and empiriocriticism"
it looks hard going; i don't think
i'll be able to understand
you've never given me the impression
of being entirely stupid
"traditional dogmatism".
You understand that, right?
And empiriocriticism? No?
Empiriocriticism is a central
doctrine based on empiricism...
...that is, that all knowledge
is derived from sense-experience
you follow me?
So, empiriocriticism means
the limits of experience
it's so warm!
Lord, grant my desire just once...
...only that once...
...and afterwards blessed be
the eternal torment
you're not mademoiselle sabine
it's already over, luckily. Look
at people when they talk to you
if only you called on god as you do
on evil, that is prayer
you won't come any more
why not? I'd miss discussing
hypostasis with you
you must go to confession
no... to tell someone else...
you'll confess to me,
and i already know
to you?
Confession is a chore for me, too,
but i do it often enough
you confess often? You never sin. I
suppose you take on the sins of others
some brickbats are wasted. You'll
be there tonight, won't you?
After 5.30. i'll wait until
you turn up
my daughter, after school...
bring her along. I'll hear
her confession, too
my soul felt like a bordello
keep your coat on. We're going
to confession
- what sins have you committed?
- Never you mind
tell me, and i'll tell you mine
- help me, father
- no need. I am listening
i failed... i said...
i don't know what my sin is called
you're a dead branch just now. Do you
know what happens to dead branches?
- What?
- They're cut off
- what happens to them?
- They're burned
i am listening
i tried to induce evil...
please don't leave your sentences
unfinished
i tried to make a priest break his
vows. Breaking the ninth commandment
tomorrow you go to see daniéle. Try
to see that your visit does her good
you can do each other good
as penitence, each evening kneel and
read some of "traditional dogmatism"
now go, wholly at peace
i went, almost at peace
i'm off to preach the gospel
to the nations of the earth
or rather, to local communities
how so?
I'm leaving saint-bernard
for a small village...
...one of a cluster with no priest
another priest and i will visit them
in turns, assisted by two young girls
that's "a mission". France is now
a land of missions
it's not a move that delights me
why aren't you pleased?
In the country, before we get serious,
talk is always about rabbits and pigs
besides, i like parish life when it's
smooth. The mission's not so sure
the villages are divided over
political matters
less worrying, they've had no priest
for goodness knows how long
so they're completely
de-christianized
no dissention there. It's almost
virgin territory
but it will take generations
to get anywhere
what are you doing there?
Watch out for those apples;
you'll be in trouble
i wouldn't mind, if i knew
what you're saying
what do you want to know?
Before he made the world, did god
do nothing? Did he get bored?
Maybe, i don't know. He made
the world through love
- why not ask him what he did before?
- That's something we are not to know
- not even you?
- No more than anyone else
- will we never know?
- We will when we die
how i'd like to be dead
meanwhile, back to bed you go. Get up
again, and i'll pull your ears
i'd like a prayer that doesn't exist
it's not nice, having to tell god
the same things every time
we'll fix that for you
it's not exactly a prayer for little
girls, but here it is anyway
lord, give us what you have left,
that no one else ever asks for
i ask not for rest and tranquillity
of either mind or body
you are asked so often for those,
lord, that you must run out
give me, lord, what you have left,
that others reject
give me what others do not want,
and give me strength and courage...
...for only you can give me what
one can only find within oneself
wondrous is the irony of god
i passionately wanted this man to
come to my room. Here he is
not forswarn and compliant as i
wished, but handsome in his piety...
...lulling my child, one of his
flock, to sleep with a poem
thank you, lord, for loving him
more than i do...
...for doing more than i asked, ;
thank you for your forbearance
our office was returning to paris,
so i was leaving about the same time
he said he'd come to say good-bye,
but days passed, i was anxious...
...wondering if he'd already gone
the abbé leaves tomorrow. Can you see
him tonight? He hasn't time to visit
we're ready to cast off
so that was all he owned
i've no socks left
can i help you to finish packing?
Thanks, but it's all done;
everything's here
there's just my backpack
to strap on tomorrow
the piano's been moved already?
It was hired, so it has gone back.
I won't have time to play now, anyway
that's so sad
no, i'll cut holes in a reed
i'll go now. Thank you for everything
have you no questions,
this last evening?
I always will have, so i'd
better shut up
dust off the chair with that rag
and sit down
now, what's the song for today?
Nothing, just a point of detail
i don't understand your saying that
the jansenists were heretics
what about the miracle of
the holy thorn?
Why wouldn't god let heretics
have their miracles?
Do you think he loves them
less than the rest?
It was you who made me think of god
as catholic
in temporal language, let's call
him the universal catholic...
...which doesn't exclude him being
called other things. Did he not say:
In my father's house
are many mansions
contradictory mansions
maybe. The contradictions are mostly
in our minds, mister mole
this time i really am going
good-bye, till we meet again
till we meet again... that's what
everyone says
we shall meet again. Not in this
world... in the next
god keep you
