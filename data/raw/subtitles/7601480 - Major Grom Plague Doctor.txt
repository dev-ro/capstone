Don't stop!
Come on!
Trying to escape?
There she is!
Gotcha!
How about that, mutt?
Don't wanna play with us anymore, huh?
Mutt!
Guys, I'm going for a three-pointer now!
Leave the dog alone!
Hey you, sucker!
You looking for trouble?
Sucker…
Just leave the dog alone!
Well, he asked for it.
20 YEARS LATER
Holy shit!
Seal the bags! Now!
Pack it up!
- Be careful!
- Money, money…
Who the hell is that?!
Shut the door on him
before we go bankrupt!
Step on it!
See you later, alligator!
You can't get us!
Stuff it back in, you clumsy moron!
Amigo! We have a problem.
Give me a second.
- Go through!
- What?
- Go through it!
- I'm on it!
Go!
Go on!
You got change for a 5,000, pals?
Igor Grom…
Was a true hero.
He was a role model for all of us.
He was a great man.
We are all going…
To miss him very much.
Think!
You've got balls.
Think!
He's on the roof!
Lose him!
Pull over!
What?
I filmed everything!
Igor!
Hop in! We've got it covered.
I'll do it. Give me some water.
Igor, are you OK?
Holy shit.
- Igor!
- Igor!
Central, do you copy?
Amigo! Cops!
What do I do?
Ready…
Hold your positions…
Step on it.
Fire!
On this special day…
I am happy to announce…
That the streets of our city…
Are now quiet and safe.
My colleague here can confirm that.
- The crime rate has reached…
- Run for your life!
…record lows…
Clear the way!
Fyodor Ivanovich.
Igor…
Who are you?
Tell me!
Who the hell are you?!
Hey, Oobie Doobie! Welcome to the Police
Directorate of St. Petersburg!
It's Dubin.
You'll need a sense of humor here.
Let's go.
A police officer will soon be assigned
to mentor you.
You'll receive a trainee's kit
with your uniform, a Taser and a torch
so you don't get lost.
I'm sorry.
Boss.
You don't go to jail for domestic violence
in this country.
But you beat up your neighbor.
He's like a brother to me, I swear.
Article 31.
Are we going to read
the Russian Constitution together?
Sonny…
Sonny, I turned around
and my wallet was gone.
Pops, your wallet is this small.
And the city is this big.
How am I supposed to find it?
You're as slow as a snail. Hurry up!
So this is our treasure room.
Hey, Mikhalych.
We store all
the key items of evidence in here.
For example, the guns those clowns had
when we caught them.
Want to try it?
Go ahead!
Are you an idiot?
Never ever touch anything in this room!
But you just said…
That was a joke. Irony, you know?
We have two types of holding cells.
The real dirtbags go to
the solitary confinement cells.
While your average lowlifes
go to the general holding cells.
FC Zenit champions?
Let us in, Gennadyevich.
Come on in.
Look at the scum in there.
You shouldn't say that.
Statistically, one in every five people
who get put in holding cells
are there by mistake.
That's me! I'm here by mistake!
Moron.
- You're the moron.
- What's that?
You're the moron!
Amigo!
Typical.
You know, kiddo,
not everyone can handle this job.
Many people quit as soon as they can.
And those who stay fall
into two categories:
Pussies and hounds.
The pussies are only interested
in saving their own asses.
They pass the buck and blame others.
Pops.
It wasn't me who stole your wallet.
Sonny, you don't get it.
I kept all my pension money in it.
And the hounds…
They'll do anything to make sure
justice is served in this city.
We pick up the scent of a bad guy
and don't stop
until he gets what he deserves.
Another joke, right?
Tzvetkov, attention!
I want to see Grom.
That's Prokopenko.
I want to see Grom!
Don't you sleep at home?
Get up.
Prokopenko wants to see you.
Hey, is he a cop?
And where did he find a garbage truck?
This is going to be fun.
Hey, Grom. You moonlighting
as a garbage truck driver now?
Hey.
Let's do it!
What's going on?
They're betting on Grom's dismissal.
It's tradition.
…destroyed 200 meters of sidewalk…
Fyodor Ivanovich?
Sit down.
Tell me. What were you doing there?
Today is your day off.
Why did you go after them alone?
- Who cares? I was successful.
- Oh were you?
You tore up the whole road!
The repairs will cost ten million.
They re-lay the tarmac every year anyway.
And using taxpayers' money, by the way.
Really?
Yeah.
You know that you put the entire
department under fire? Everyone!
This time he's going for sure.
I covered all the bases.
Are you a damn ball player?
You covered all the bases!
Or are you a superhero?
Are you?
I'm sick and tired of your tricks!
You don't wear a body camera!
You ignore instructions!
You don't care about the consequences!
I don't get it. What do you want?
To prove you're the toughest?
Am I not?
I accomplish more alone
than the rest of the directorate
put together.
But why the hell are you doing it? Why?
We have to work as a team, get it?
But you're always getting yourself
in trouble alone!
And I have to cover for your ass.
But that's exactly what you need.
The clearance rate would
go to pot without me.
Why don't you resign? Resign!
And we can compare! Go on!
Here! Write your letter of resignation!
"Please be advised
that I voluntarily resign
from the law enforcement agencies.
Please also strip me of all titles,
from major to private."
Keep writing!
Date and sign and it.
{\an8}POLICE DIRECTORATE OF ST. PETERSBURG
Here you go, Pops.
You know…
I threw in 100 rubles too.
It's the least we can do.
Happy to serve.
{\an8}THE NEWS WITH ANNA TEREBKINA
{\an8}NEWS
ST. PETERSBURG
{\an8}Hello. This is Anna Terebkina
with today's top news.
{\an8}Rosgarantbank employees
had barely recovered from the robbery
{\an8}of their central branch
{\an8}when they found themselves
under siege again.
{\an8}This time from
duped investors and clients.
{\an8}The bank's owner, Olga Isayeva,
declined to comment on the situation.
{\an8}On to other news now.
{\an8}Today is the last hearing in the trial
of Kirill Grechkin,
{\an8}the son of the famous billionaire.
{\an8}He is being accused
of first-degree homicide.
{\an8}In April this year,
Kirill's car fatally hit Liza Makarova,
{\an8}a resident of the local children's home.
That was the day of our field trip.
We'd come to see the bascule bridges.
Liza and I went to a coffee shop
to buy some ice cream.
Look who's here.
We stepped out of the shop.
- And this moron came out of nowhere.
- Objection! Verbal abuse!
Please, watch your tongue.
Grechkin came out of nowhere. Hammered.
Objection! The experts found
no sign of booze!
- Sustained.
- He bribed them!
Order!
You may continue.
Your Honor.
Liza is…
My only family.
She was.
OK, sorry.
If there is any justice in the world…
Kirill Grechkin must be punished.
- Kirill!
- Kirill!
Kirill! What's your reaction
to the court ruling?
Our courts are
the most compassionate in the world!
Kirill, what are you going to do now?
I don't know, take a vacation somewhere.
You wanna come with me?
But first, I will file a complaint
against the municipal police.
Major Grom used excessive force
when he arrested me.
My arms are still bruised.
Look at them.
That's what I call police lawlessness.
Hey, easy, chill.
Wanna go to jail instead of him?
I don't care! I'll never let it rest!
What else do you wanna know?
Calm down.
Igor.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Tatyana Mikhailovna, Lyosha's teacher.
- Nice to meet you.
- Please, forgive him.
- He is grieving.
- I know.
- Please, call me if you need anything.
- Thank you.
Sorry, could you…
Write it down? Or take a picture?
This is my only card.
Of course.
Thank you! Everyone's free to go now.
Especially me.
PROKOPENKO:
ARE YOU COMING OVER?
Forget the old messenger apps, sites,
and streaming services.
Welcome to the first ever AI social media
platform: Vmeste (Together).
In your envelopes
you'll find a pair of AR glasses.
There's a button on the temple.
Press it to activate the glasses.
Can you see me better now?
My name is Margo.
I'm your new virtual personal assistant.
Over the last five years,
Vmeste has become
a top social network…
What if they don't like it?
Sergey, this is your life's work.
It will start a revolution.
- But what if...
- No ifs.
Go knock 'em dead.
And now, please welcome…
I believe in you.
…the Head
of the Vmeste Charity Foundation,
the IT guru and philanthropist,
Sergey Razumovskiy.
The update we developed…
Will amaze you.
But a picture is
worth a thousand words, right?
Margo, start the presentation.
Vmeste 2,0 is not just a regular update.
It's a symbol.
A symbol of the new
and free Russian Internet.
From now on, your personal data will go
through one-way encryption.
Which means that no one,
I repeat, absolutely no one, will be able…
To access them.
Not even you?
Not even me.
You will also be able
to keep your anonymity
while accessing any website.
Even those blocked under court order.
But most importantly…
We are granting our customers…
Unlimited access to content.
You can read books and articles,
listen to music,
and watch movies,
all completely free of charge…
And, most importantly, perfectly legal.
Study and self-improvement…
Will help us change our lives
for the better, together.
Did they let Grechkin off? Really?!
I'm sorry.
Sergey. You were a star.
Remember, in 15 minutes...
Cancel all my meetings.
Or reschedule. I don't know…
- I'm unavailable.
- I'm on it.
- Sergey!
- Sergey!
Oleg, this is bullshit!
Apparently…
These people are above the law.
They can steal, rape or kill
and get away with it!
I try…
I try my best…
To make people's lives better.
But now…
All this is pointless now.
This girl and her brother…
They're from our children's home, Oleg.
How many more will be killed
or injured because of guys like Grechkin?
Who will protect them?!
I don't know what to do.
It's a nightmare.
And it will happen again.
No, it won't.
I promise you.
BILLIONAIRE'S SON RELEASED
What can we do, Igor?
Rich kids like Grechkin
always get off scot-free.
Good job!
Thank you!
You know, I remember,
when I worked with your dad,
we often had "clients" like Grechkin.
But, as they say, sooner or later…
All these p...
Fyodor!
As I was saying, all these pricks
will get what they deserve.
Believe me.
It's not our job to issue verdicts.
We just find and nail the bad guys…
And let justice be served.
There's no justice.
The system is rotten…
To the core.
Igor…
You work like a dog, you risk your life.
- Keep it down.
- You find damning evidence.
But the court lets them go.
- Is that OK?
- Quiet!
- We have to keep to the law.
- The law doesn't work.
What do you suggest then?
Boil them alive?
Or fry them?
Here you go, Igor. I mended it.
Thank you, Auntie Lena.
Nice life you've got there, Igor.
- Calm down.
- Why?
- I can do it easy.
- Easy.
That's not my point. Do you have a girl?
- Fyodor…
- What? He's always working!
That's his life.
Excuse me. It's work-related.
What did I tell you? Work again.
You were exactly the same
when you were young.
You thought about nothing
besides work and your bike.
Hello?
Hello, Igor?
This is Tatyana Mikhailovna.
You said I could call you.
Sure. What happened?
I'm worried about Lyosha.
He's disappeared.
He wasn't at dinner.
He's not answering his phone.
I'm afraid he'll do something stupid.
That was a nice try.
But karma is a bitch.
What do you want from me?!
Justice.
No!
This is a bad dream. It's not real!
Think!
Perfect.
No way.
Freeze! Police!
OK, Kostya.
I think we've got a match.
Yes, Igor, this guy was here as a suspect.
He's a dangerous offender.
He matches your description. Is this him?
I've never seen anything like him.
His reactions were lightning-fast.
He had armor and flamethrowers.
This is the guy, right?
Oh yes.
One little hitch:
He's an immortal fairytale character.
Why's he so gloomy?
I'll go to the evidence room
to break his immortality spell.
We'll break his needle.
We'll seal his swamp.
And we'll drag his cat in for questioning.
Are all our cases solved then?
Get back to your workstations.
We detained a suspect.
This Lyosha of yours.
He was hanging around
the Grechkins' neighborhood.
Where is he?
In the interrogation room.
Don't leave your stuff lying around.
Did forensics find anything?
Nada. No footprints,
no fingerprints, nothing.
That's something new, right?
- Where are you going?
- Excuse me.
My name is Dima Dubin. I'm a trainee here.
- I did a sketch based on your description.
- Let him in.
- Let me see.
- Where you eavesdropping?
No, I just overheard you talking.
Here you go.
OK…
Do you need help? I can help.
It's too soon for that, OK?
- Can you draw me?
- I can.
Look, kiddo.
I know you didn't kill him.
I want to help you.
Someone else already helped me…
By killing that moron.
You know anything about it?
Yep.
Whoever did it is a real hero.
Igor, the kid doesn't have an alibi,
and he's got a motive.
Case closed?
Mouth closed.
And you might pass as smart.
Do you want a pie or not?
FLAMETHROWER
SEARCH
{\an8}MAKE A FLAMETHROWER AT HOME
…COSTUME WITH A BIRD'S HEAD MASK…
BIRDS
Hello. Were you
at school with Kirill Grechkin?
I wish he were dead.
He is.
- I'll pay the rest later.
- It's fine.
…there's another landfill scandal.
Clouds of noxious fumes…
Will you stop feeding the mutt?
She'll scare away all my customers.
…the landfill site owner,
Filipp Zilchenko,
said the current environmental situation
was normal for, and I quote:
"A city built on a swamp."
Help!
- Please, don't!
- Come here!
Relax or you'll make it worse!
Please, let me go.
The quicker we're done,
the sooner you'll get home.
Please.
Hey bitches!
Leave her alone!
Or shall I call an ambulance?
You mean, the police?
No.
The police is already here.
Hey, hero, you've read too many comics...
Here, hold this.
You're a sicko!
It's OK.
I'm lucky you live nearby.
You don't get many visitors, do you?
Why?
There's no door to the toilet.
Right.
How about a cup of tea?
I'm OK, thanks.
OK, one second.
OK…
Some tea?
Or some pasta?
I'm out of tea,
so I just boiled you some water…
He gave you quite an ass-kicking.
That jerk nearly ripped my face off.
I think you look better now.
Hey!
That wasn't the deal.
You'd better cough up another ten
for moral damages.
Or you'll be sorry.
OK, no problem, guys.
Whatever you say.
You're a sicko!
{\an8}GRECHKIN JUNIOR
RIP, SCUMBAG
YOU HAD IT COMING, RICH BOY
Can you feel it?
The air is fresher.
The city feels cleaner.
You?
Me.
Do you even understand what you've done?
Of course.
I delivered justice.
Justice?
Well, a kind of justice.
Sorry, by the way.
I spent a hell of a lot of your money
on this costume but…
I am kind of like Batman now.
Although Batman never kills.
I am cooler.
Oleg.
You killed someone.
What did you want me to do?
Visit Grechkin and put him
in the naughty corner?
I'm the one who solves your problems
in a tough and uncompromising way.
You knew perfectly well
that I was going to kill him.
But you didn't stop me.
Because you wanted him dead too.
You know that those scumbags destroy
our city while enjoying total impunity!
And there's no other way to stop them!
Stop the hysterics.
And don't stand in my way.
The fun is only just getting started!
Our city is seriously ill.
It's been struck
by a plague of corruption,
greed and lawlessness.
The law enforcement system was powerless
to stop Kirill Grechkin.
But not me.
{\an8}His death was but my first act of justice.
{\an8}I will stop at nothing
to reduce the disease to mere ashes.
For I am…
The Plague Doctor.
Or do I sound too pretentious?
Meet Olga Isayeva,
the owner of Rosgarantbank.
Although,
you know her only too well.
Don't you?
You were her clients,
and Olga cheated you.
She evicted you from your homes,
seized your property
and sent collectors after you.
Am I forgetting anything?
Son of a bitch!
You don't know who you're messing with!
You're finished.
No.
It's you who is finished.
Together with your rotten bank.
Tick-tock.
Clown!
Who do you think you are?!
I'll destroy you!
You're dead!
All of this is yours!
And soon enough we'll take our city back.
HE'S A SICKO.
BUT THOSE SCUMBAGS DESERVE IT.
The public is fired up.
A masked vigilante
calling himself the Plague Doctor
has declared war
on the city's influencers,
{\an8}and is enjoying huge support online.
{\an8}His unprecedentedly violent video
has had over ten million views.
And his channel
on the Vmeste social network
had over a million subscribers
even before the police arrived
at the crime scene.
It's hardcore.
You tell me.
I almost spewed when I saw it.
What happened to that orphan?
They let him go.
We should've listened to Grom.
- Have some gum!
- I don't want any.
The Plague Doctor is bringing new justice!
Shit, this psycho already has fans.
Gum! Give me some gum!
Who is that?
It's Major Grom. I…
I told you about him.
This is Yevgeniy Strelkov.
He came from Moscow especially…
To investigate the case
of the Plague Doctor.
Thanks, but I don't need any help.
They didn't tell you?
This is slightly awkward.
This is my case now.
I'd love to keep you on the team, but…
I'm afraid my superiors would
never agree to it.
Sorry. I have my orders.
Can I help you in any way?
You sure can.
Two cups of coffee with milk.
No sugar for Misha.
Excuse me. Igor!
Why didn't you tell me?
Am I your secretary now?
- I was told this morning.
- But it's my case!
Relax!
Different people were calling
me all night.
All I could say between their orders
was "Yes, sir!"
A few questions!
And then this asshole shows up.
Wait!
Let's go to mine for some borscht.
I've got a great case for you
to get your teeth into.
You'll never look back. You'll love it!
Twelve fridges went missing?
How cool is that!
No, I mean, it's a terrible crime.
And now we're investigating it together.
I never expected it.
Just yesterday, sir, you…
Or may I drop the formalities
now that we're partners?
Well, that's what Fyodor Ivanovich said.
Anyway, I'm so happy
they assigned you to me.
But it really is interesting!
Who could have broken
into a huge warehouse
to take nothing except fridges?
Why not TV sets or laptops?
What if they'd hijacked the trucks?
Or maybe it's even bigger.
Shit, I've got so many questions.
But one thing for sure is that
we must find and punish the thieves.
We can't let them get away with it.
Igor?
Wait, Igor!
Where are you going?
A HERO OF OUR TIME
I'm asking everyone to remain calm.
Let me assure you that we'll do our best
to detain the psycho
and prosecute him
to the fullest extent of the law.
Who's investigating the case?
Our very best men.
{\an8}PLAGUE
God, it stinks in here!
The landfill site has made the entire
neighborhood a complete mess.
Igor, what are we doing here?
I'm working.
I have no idea what you're doing here.
Don't even think about telling them
that you're a cop, got it?
Hey, what are you looking at?
Hey you, come here!
Who's the squeaker?
Hey guys.
Wait here.
COACH
What the hell you doing, bro?
I spent half an hour building this shit.
Hey man.
- Some things never change, right?
- Come on.
What's buzzin'?
What do you know
about the 12 stolen fridges?
Look, man.
I'd never do business with such a dumb-ass.
I'd never even sit at the same table.
So I have no idea who did it.
But…
I know a couple of dudes
who can probably help.
I could give you a list if you want.
Do me a favor, bro.
You cops. All you want is free favors.
That doesn't work around here.
Cut the bullshit.
Before I ask you
where this dough is coming from.
- You threatening me now?
- Yeah.
Do you want me to tell your mom
what you're doing here?
Oh man!
Spare me this bullshit, please!
- Don't do that.
- Come on.
OK, I'll write you a list right now.
- No mistakes.
- Sit still!
If you get to know anything
about the fridges, call me, OK?
I left my number here.
Sure thing, bro.
Seryoga. That's you, for real.
Thanks, guys.
Just be nice.
They're all respectable people.
OK.
What kind of door is this?
Hey bitches!
I need information!
Who was it?
What?
Tell me.
I don't know.
OK then.
I dunno!
I… don't know…
…anything.
- You sure?
- Yes!
Over there.
Are you OK?
I can't believe we're investigating
the Plague Doctor together.
Together… Vmeste…
I'm an idiot.
What are we going to do next?
- You're going back to the station.
- Got it.
- You write a report.
- OK.
On how we looked for the fridges all day.
- I'll check it when I get back.
- OK.
Sergey, you have a visitor.
I'm busy.
It's a police officer.
Seriously.
Police Major Igor Grom.
Hello.
Tea, coffee, soda?
Wow.
Why is it so big?
When I was a kid,
I always envied those who could
afford to buy these things.
So you could say
I'm closing my open Gestalt.
- Making up for lost time?
- Kind of.
Cool.
I came to talk
about the Plague Doctor video.
I thought you might have.
I've already deleted the original.
But that only made people post
more and more duplicates.
{\an8}Our algorithm prioritized the video
and shared it to people's feeds…
That's not why I came.
I want to find the person
who streamed the original video.
Decentralized encryption
makes it impossible
to track the users of the network.
I'm afraid
it's technologically unfeasible.
Why build a system you can't control?
Because freedom of expression is
a fundamental human right.
You wanted
to promote freedom of expression…
But instead you gave
a serial killer a platform.
And you…
What have you got to do with the case?
I mean, someone already came to see me…
Your smiley-faced colleague.
I discussed all this with him.
Yes, he asked me to fill in some blanks.
Don't worry, I won't report you.
The more people investigate
the Plague Doctor, the better.
{\an8}POLICE
ST. PETERSBURG
Who the hell are you,
you big-nosed pterodactyl?
Igor! Here's my report, as you asked.
Move.
I spent the whole day on it.
And I found something.
- Look on Page 4...
- Not now.
Igor!
Yulia Pchyolkina posted a new video.
It's about the Plague Doctor.
It may be useful.
I got hold of the photos taken
at the scene of Kirill Grechkin's murder.
He was the Plague Doctor's first victim.
The photos clearly show
that the poor boy attempted to escape.
But he suffered the fate of the bear
from the well-known joke.
Who is she again?
- You don't know Yulia Pchyolkina?
- No.
She's a star. She investigates cases
and posts her videos.
The police composite tells us
that the cops knew about him
from the get-go.
But they did nothing to stop him.
Look, that's my sketch.
Cool!
Wait a second…
How did she get it?
And all the other documents?
Have we got a rat around here?
Look. You don't have
any other work to do, do you?
First of all, we must find
the Plague Doctor. Right, partner?
First of all…
You must find the fridges.
Freon. Search!
I'm done for the day.
But you keep working.
Here.
Have some coffee.
I thought you wanted some tea.
Wanna tell me how you got in here?
Nope.
Wanna apologize?
No.
We got off to a bad start.
You know that your shenanigans could
cost me my job?
Shit happens.
Shit happens?
Really?
Well, what do you want me to do?
Kneel at your feet and beg for mercy?
It's every person for themselves.
Listen, sweetheart.
You better had think about yourself.
One more trick like this will turn
the star of the Internet into a star…
Of our holding cells.
How long did that take you?
About ten minutes.
- While I was washing your laptop.
- What?
It had so much dirt on it.
Meaning?
You motherf…
FOULING HIS OWN NEST
{\an8}Meet…
{\an8}Filipp Zilchenko.
He has a monopoly on waste.
And here is his masterpiece.
Babies are born with defects.
People suffer from terrible diseases.
The city is suffocating.
All because of…
This man here.
Please, I'm begging you.
It's not my fault.
Please, spare my family! I…
Your filthy dump has killed
thousands of people.
That same fate
awaits your family now.
Let's make a deal!
No.
The Plague Doctor has committed
yet another brutal murder.
{\an8}The Plague Doctor…
{\an8}The Plague Doctor…
{\an8}He is a complete nutcase.
{\an8}Why kill the kid?
{\an8}A fighter for justice
or a sociopathic megalomaniac?
Criminal groups are enjoying impunity.
People have turned to rioting and looting.
{\an8}It's insane! What are you doing?!
You can buy a mask like this one
in numerous online stores
for a mere 99 rubles.
Ban them!
Law enforcement agencies say
they're doing their best,
{\an8}but the crime rate is rising too fast.
{\an8}Decent people can see he crossed the line.
{\an8}No comment.
{\an8}It's embarrassing, but we must admit
{\an8}that the serial killer
has become a super star.
You… You've gone insane.
Why did you kill the entire family?!
Have you seen what's going on out there?!
Oleg, these people are your followers!
You have to stop.
Or I'll stop you.
And what are you going to do?
Me?
I'll take away your support.
I'll switch off the servers!
I'll shut down the social network.
You mean…
You'd sacrifice your life's work for…
A handful of fat scumbags?
Do you think
that will make people's lives better?
Was that your dream?
I'm calling the cops.
Sergey, should I call
the emergency services?
Don't forget to tell them you knew
about it from the very beginning.
Oleg!
Listen to me!
I'm asking…
No, I'm begging you, you hear?!
You've got to stop.
No.
Igor, are you in there?
You didn't come to the station today.
Are you OK?
Hi.
They told me that you love this stuff.
OK…
You have five minutes.
Did you see what the Plague Doctor did?
The whole city is going crazy.
We have to get him.
- Did you find the stolen fridges?
- I…
Froze that case for now.
Did you buy this by the metro station?
No potatoes next time.
It's so stuffy in here.
May I open the window?
Wow! Cool!
Did you build
the Plague Doctor's criminal profile?
They taught us how to do that
in the Police Academy.
What type of serial killer is he?
Ah, he's mission-orientated.
Pension-oriented…
He pursues a higher goal
and kills for the sake of his ideals.
But why make videos?
Is it about sublimation?
He wants attention.
And video streaming helps him
compensate for the lack of it.
Yeah, childhood is the key
to these psychos.
He was probably a lonely child.
Or an orphan! Listen, Igor.
We need a list of...
Forget about it.
We'll never identify him from this.
There's no evidence, no accomplices.
We can only nail him
at the next crime scene.
But you analyzed his actions.
He's raising the stakes with every murder.
Look at Grechkin.
He destroyed one person's life.
Isayeva cheated several hundred.
With Zilchenko we're talking
about thousands.
That means that his next victim is someone
everybody hates.
You know who that could be?
You.
I don't know.
We have so many
crazy moneybags in this city.
If I were one of them, I would hide
in some underground bunker.
Right.
Tonight's the opening
of the Golden Dragon casino.
And most of the people from the list
will be there. Look, Igor.
Look.
OPENING OF THE GOLDEN DRAGON CASINO
IN ST. PETERSBURG
Not bad.
We should warn Strelkov now.
Are you nuts?
He'll arrive with a special op army.
He'll scare the Plague Doctor away
and ruin everything.
Cool. Then it's just the two of us, right?
- Because we're partners.
- Us?
We're not partners.
Got it?
Oh, come on.
We balance out each other's weak points.
What are my weak points?
Well…
Honestly speaking, you…
You often break the rules.
So you're going to tell me
how to do my job now?
There are standard interrogation
and arrest procedures
which we must follow.
Look here.
A masked sociopath armed with bombs
and flamethrowers is loose in the city.
And you want to catch him
according to procedure?
He'll burn the city to the ground
before I finish all the paperwork.
If I go by the rules to get the bad guys,
I'd never get any of them. Know why?
They have no rules.
So what makes you different from them?
Yesterday you punched people to get info.
What will you do tomorrow?
I'll punch people again.
You're blurring the line between yourself
and criminals.
I know my limits.
I never kill anyone.
One day you will.
OK. Get out. Your five minutes are up.
Go.
Are you going to lose the cap or what?
Or are you a part-time taxi driver now?
You got an invite?
It wasn't easy at all.
I didn't have to go to a sauna
with big shots
but it was still quite a sweat.
You don't think much of me, Grom.
Come on, dude!
If that were the case,
you would have gone
to jail a long time ago.
- Oh, come on!
- Cool ride!
Right?! "B" means boosted.
You know, someone stole
exactly the same one last week.
- Really?
- Really.
- No kidding?
- No kidding. The keys.
- What?
- Give me the keys.
You're joking.
Your keys, sir.
Take care of it.
And don't touch the cap.
Hey man. Cool car.
I had a car like that too.
It was stolen last week.
Case closed.
Congratulations
on the opening
of my new casino -
The Golden Dragon.
I'd like to raise a glass
to everyone here.
Because we are
the cream of the crop in this city.
Here's to us! Cheers!
We can't do any business in Shanghai.
Or in Beijing.
But St. Petersburg is where
we can do some serious stuff.
The city is at our feet, gentlemen.
- You again.
- Nice to see you too.
- What's this?
- A bug.
Never seen one before? Give it back.
What are you doing here?
What can a reporter do
at a billionaire's party?
I just don't know.
What is a policeman doing here?
And wearing a fancy suit, too?
- Are you undercover?
- OK.
It's time for you to go home.
If you behave like an idiot…
They'll kick both of us out. Got it?
Let's dance?
May I ask you something?
What do you think of the Plague Doctor?
What do I think?
He's a murderer - plain and simple.
The people wouldn't agree.
You know they're calling him a Robin Hood?
I don't give a shit. I'm gonna bring
the asshole down. End of story.
My turn now.
Why are your videos so negative?
Why don't you show the true
heroes of the city?
Like who?
Razumovskiy, for example?
Razumovskiy?
He's not a hero.
The people wouldn't agree.
The people…
Know nothing about his shady deals.
His contract with HOLT International says
a lot about the man.
I will make you a rich man.
Sweetie, will you walk them out?
Hello.
Look who's here!
I'm happy that you came by.
That was a great speech, Albert Adamovich.
Too bad you forgot to mention
how you got hold
of this fantastic place.
Everybody knows how.
The old shack was demolished,
leaving the plot empty.
What you call a shack…
Was a historic building.
Sergey, don't start that again!
I did it all properly.
I've got all the papers.
The shack was not subject to…
- What you call it?
- Restoration.
Restoration.
Look around!
We both know
how you obtained the authorization.
Just think about it.
This building survived
the Bolshevik revolution,
the Civil War
and the Siege.
But you and your casino are worse
than any disaster.
- Can you give me my phone?
- HOLT… it rings a bell.
What is it?
Only one of the largest weapons
manufacturers in the world.
Thank you.
So believe me.
There are no heroes in this city.
I'll be the first to know when we get one.
Year after year you profit off
of ordinary people.
Just remember this one thing.
You won't need money when you die.
Think about that
when you're counting your billions.
Little son of a bitch.
I don't want to dirty my hands.
Security!
Kick him out of here!
Well? You're done, you bastards!
Let's rock'n'roll!
Take cover!
Screw it!
I should be there.
Dima.
Where are you rushing off to?
Sit down.
Tell me, how is your
and Grom's investigation going?
It's routine police work.
We go around interviewing people…
And looking for the fridges.
All very boring.
Dima, you're such a bad liar.
I know perfectly well that you and Grom
are investigating
the Plague Doctor's case.
And I'm sure that was not your idea.
You know that.
Major Grom's methods are illegal.
And helping him investigate the case
is a crime too.
Yevgeniy Borisovich,
are you interrogating me?
Listen, sucker.
I'm tired of being nice to you.
You have two options.
Either you tell me everything
and I forget our little talk.
Or you keep lying,
and I'll make your life a living hell.
I can do it. And I love doing it.
Well?
While we struggle…
To live off our meager salaries,
you've got a pretty good set-up.
You pig out and have fun.
But the time has come
to pay the piper, right?
Excuse me!
Please!
- Hear me out!
- Let him talk.
I know why you are here.
But violence is not a solution.
What do you want?
You want money? We'll give you money.
Let's try to resolve this peacefully.
- Do you want money?
- My name is Sergey.
Sergey Razumovskiy.
The Sergey Razumovskiy.
We got lucky, right, guys?
Tell me, Sergey Razumovskiy,
Are you going to bribe us?
You know what?
We're gonna take it all anyway!
Who did it?!
Think!
Get him!
No time.
Finish him off!
What are you waiting for? Go!
Get him!
You!
Trying to play the hero?
What are you thinking?
Hands in the air!
We're in!
Let's get out of here!
Hands up! On the floor!
Sector 1 clear!
Face to the floor!
Hands behind your head! Legs apart!
- Face to the floor!
- Don't look up!
They're copycats.
Several of them escaped.
We got the rest.
Good job.
Take them to the van!
You saved my life.
I wanted to thank you.
It's no big deal.
You were also great,
you acted like a real man.
Igor!
If you need anything,
I'd be happy to help.
I'm absolutely sure
that it's the impact of social media…
Talk to the girl.
- Miss, you can't film here.
- It's OK, I'm a reporter.
That was good timing.
Well? How are we doing?
Everything under control?
We're doing great.
You, not so much.
- Why's that?
- That's the way it is.
You're fired.
Igor!
That was awesome! Just…
Wow! I filmed it all.
I just need your comments.
- Give it here.
- OK.
…obstructing justice,
negligence when performing
danger assessments,
excess of authority…
Your partner threw you under the bus. So.
Either you kick him out
or I'll send this file
up the chain of command.
- You…
- Fyodor Ivanovich!
Take it easy.
What are you…
I quit.
No.
It's OK.
No.
Igor.
Good boy.
Partner.
Igor, I…
The train's moving really fast.
I'm lying on the roof.
The blood is gushing out of me.
Snow is blowing in my face.
And I think:
I should buy a scarf.
We mustn't wake Lena.
Igor.
Aren't you sick and tired of being alone?
Why would I want anyone by my side?
I feel great alone.
You don't trust anyone, do you, Igor?
I was exactly the same.
I never trusted anyone.
Why trust people?
They'll sell you out anyway, right?
But then, Igor,
I met your dad.
And then Lena.
And my whole life turned
upside down, you see?
Because when you know that you've got
your family, friend, and wife
standing behind you,
it gives you so much strength.
You can move heaven and earth.
The second wind kicks in.
Don't push people away, Igor.
They'll give you strength.
What do you want?
- Hi Yulia.
- Wanna break my TV now? Go on.
I…
Kind of I freaked out there.
Here.
It costs your monthly salary.
I'll use next month's
to buy you a laptop, promise.
Take it.
OK, I have to go.
Forgive me for everything.
I didn't mean it.
I promise.
TRAINEE
Ilya!
- Hello.
- Hello.
It's good that you called, Igor.
I'm really worried about Lyosha.
He's been gone for two days now.
- I have a feeling that he...
- Yes, I know.
Can I see his room?
Sure, of course.
- It's a nice place.
- Yes, Sergey Razumovskiy helps us a lot.
He sponsored the restoration
of the building.
He sends money and gifts for the kids.
He grew up here.
And now he helps us.
God bless him.
We kept some things from his childhood.
Who is that by his side?
Oleg Volkov - his only friend.
They became best friends
as soon as he arrived here.
Later Sergey went to college to study,
and Oleg served in the army.
- May I take a look?
- Yes, of course.
Sergey was all alone before he met Oleg.
He always played on his own.
And he'd sketch all sorts
in his notebooks.
He's got an artistic personality.
He pursues a higher goal
and kills for the sake of his ideals.
He was probably a lonely child.
When I was a kid, I always envied those…
His channel on the Vmeste social network…
- Vmeste…
- Mission-oriented…
God bless him.
Whoever did it is a real hero.
Razumovskiy?
He's not a hero.
His contract with HOLT International…
And Oleg served in the army.
One of the largest weapons
manufacturers in the world.
Vmeste…
Thank you for finding some time for me.
Of course, Igor!
- After what you did for me.
- That was no big deal.
- Can we drop the formalities?
- Sure.
Come on in.
I'm sorry about the mess.
Do you really live here?
Yep.
I try to make
the most effective use of my time.
Not waste it on a commute.
How about a drink?
No, thanks. I can't drink on duty.
It's a really cool place.
With all these sculptures…
Venus is beautiful.
The original, I guess?
No, thanks.
Tell me something.
What is more expensive: All of this
or a single Plague Doctor outfit?
I don't know.
Come on.
Your contract with HOLT International.
Take a look.
The Description of Services refers to
updating office security systems.
And I wondered why one
of the largest weapons manufacturers
would install
alarm systems in your office.
And here are the drawings
you did as a kid.
Look at them.
Do they remind you of anything?
And now tell me, scumbag,
why you killed all those people.
It wasn't me.
Who then? I want the name.
Oleg?
Funny.
I thought so too at first.
That your friend Oleg Volkov did it.
But then I found out
that he was killed in Syria last year.
So no more bullshit.
Either you give me all the details…
Look me in the eyes!
…or I'll make you talk.
What are you looking at?
I didn't think you'd ever do it.
- Oleg.
- Enough.
Oleg is not here.
And he never has been.
You know it perfectly well.
It has always been me.
Your… whole… life.
Hi.
What's your name?
Sergey.
I'm Uncle Kostya.
How old are you?
- I'm eight.
- Wow.
My son is a bit older than you.
There was a fire here recently.
Get out of here, dork.
Three boys died.
Did you see anything?
No.
You were alone. That's why I showed up.
I've always been by your side.
I protected you.
We lived in perfect harmony, buddy.
What happened?
Oh yes.
You found a real friend.
And you forgot about me.
But I never went away.
All this time, I've been living
inside your head.
And now that Oleg is gone,
I am back.
Look at what we did together.
- You killed all those people!
- We killed them together.
What's wrong with that?
You said yourself you wanted
to make the city a better place.
I'm not a killer!
You hated the kids who bullied you
in the orphanage,
the mobsters who tried
to grab your business,
the rich guys who poison our city!
I remember everyone who hurt you.
And God is my witness,
I was patient for far too long.
The time has come.
I created you.
So if I really will it,
you will disappear.
Go away!
Nice try.
I'm not just your imaginary friend.
You see.
I helped you kill before.
But…
This time…
Is entirely on your conscience.
That means only one thing.
We are becoming one.
I'll kill myself! I'll kill both of us!
Don't even think about it, sucker!
I won't let you ruin my plan.
You're going to like it.
You'll see it come true
with your own eyes!
The Golden Dragon Casino.
Just yesterday there was a feast here
in the time of plague.
Today it's ablaze with its owner inside.
Albert Bekhtiev bartered away his home
city and worshiped the golden calf.
He paid for that with his own life.
The same fate awaits all the moneybags
who dared to break the law.
What the hell…?
Surrender!
Resistance is futile. You're surrounded.
I repeat, resistance is futile.
Come down here. Let's talk.
Freeze!
Keep your hands down!
Yevgeniy Borisovich, we lost him.
Central, I think I got the Plague Doctor.
It's gonna blow Igor away.
Razumovskiy is the Plague Doctor?
- Yes.
- That's bullshit!
Just check out the evidence
I have against him!
- You mean his childhood drawings?
- Yes.
Darling.
You were caught
at the crime scene red-handed!
{\an8}The man behind the Plague Doctor mask
was arrested this evening.
{\an8}His true identity has
not yet been disclosed.
- Three o'clock?
- Clear.
- Clear at nine.
- Clear at 12.
We won't let you!
We'll never forgive!
Free the Plague Doctor!
Free the Plague Doctor!
Free the Plague Doctor!
Free the Plague Doctor!
I do judo.
I'm not asking for me. I…
You have to understand, you promised.
- I remember you said…
- Fyodor Ivanovich?
I came to say goodbye.
Understood, sir.
- I…
- Do you know what's going on out there?
Your lawyer is here.
When did you become a defense lawyer?
You really want to discuss that now?
What do you want?
Another exclusive story?
I want to help you.
I'm sure you were framed.
Why is that?
They'd never have caught the real
Plague Doctor so easily. He's no fool.
Well…
- I almost started to like you.
- Igor.
Can you stop being a stubborn mule
for a second and admit it?
I'm your only hope.
Tell me what happened.
I'll publish it and they'll let you go.
I don't have that much time.
I have to get out of here now.
First, I nail the Plague Doctor…
Then we'll talk.
As you wish.
You forgot your trash.
Yevgeniy Borisovich!
- Igor is innocent!
- That's for the judge to say.
Moscow calling.
Dima, you're starting to annoy me.
- Did I make myself clear?
- But he couldn't have done it.
Hello?
A hitman with a rat?
- What is this bullshit?
- Yevgeniy Borisovich!
- OK.
- Yevgeniy Borisovich!
A true master never forgets.
You've got five minutes.
Give me your Taser too.
How can you wear this shit?
- Hey dude…
- Igor!
What's she doing here?
What do you mean?
I thought you asked her here.
Boys, can we discuss it on the way?
We still have to get out of here
and catch the Plague Doctor. OK?
YOU'RE LEAVING ST. PETERSBURG
Igor. Where are we?
- Prokopenko's country house.
- Is he the Plague Doctor?
What?
No, you're going to stay here
until I nail Razumovskiy.
Razumovskiy?
I knew he was involved somehow.
This is going to be sensational.
- Igor, we should go together.
- No way.
You'll stay here. I'll do it alone.
You got me out. Your conscience is clear.
Good job.
You got what you wanted?
You know who the Plague Doctor is?
Go make a video.
You know, Igor. I understood something.
I'm not a pussy. I'm a hound.
And you…
Are a hound too.
And she's also a hound.
And we should stick together.
Because we are a damn pack!
I'm afraid to trust the wrong person.
But friends in need are friends indeed.
Take the torch.
Go grab a gun from the storage room.
Igor, there's nothing but jars here.
Sorry, man.
Open the door, Igor.
It's not funny, you hear me?
I can't believe he fell for that.
You'll stay in charge.
Open the door in a couple of hours
when he's calmed down.
Igor!
Hide the car. They'll be looking for it.
Damn.
Is that your father?
Two peas in a pod.
Igor.
Wait. Do you have a plan?
Of course.
What?
Good luck.
Stop right there before I call the police.
I'm kidding.
Hello, Igor. Please come in.
My respects, Igor.
I didn't think you'd get out that quickly.
Nevertheless,
you still won't stop me
from saving the city.
I returned money to the clients
Isayeva cheated in her bank.
I bought Zilchenko's landfill site,
and I'll really clean up the city.
Grechkin and Bekhtiev didn't die in vain.
Thanks to them I can build a new…
Perfect city.
And no one can stand in my way.
Not even you.
You sure?
Nice try.
Margo, stream the video.
Yes, Sergey. You're on.
If you're watching this video,
that means I got busted.
But that doesn't mean it's all over.
I call on everyone
who believes in fair trials.
You know perfectly well who is poisoning
our city and how they're doing it.
Here are their names and addresses.
You know what to do.
You have the power to stop them.
Those assholes will try to escape.
But don't let them.
I will help you.
Turn back.
I've got one more joker up my sleeve.
I'd rather die a free man
than spend the rest
of my life behind bars.
And I'll take the corrupt pigs
who run errands for scumbags with me.
The police can't stop you.
Finish what I started.
Now each of you is the Plague Doctor.
What did you do?
Relax, Igor.
Everything's going to plan.
The human trash will flood the streets,
convinced of their impunity.
The army will arrive in a couple of hours
to clean up the city…
Once and for all.
And thus I'll get rid of the moneybags
who poison the city
and the lowlifes who mimic me.
Do you know how many people have died?
How many more will die?
Does it matter?
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.
Look at this braveheart!
Come on!
Get him!
THE HIGH AND MIGHTY:
WHO'S NEXT?
THE JUDGE. 26 FONTANKA EMBANKMENT
I'll give you everything.
Here… take it.
Grandpa, who is that?
Igor.
You don't stand a chance.
Goddammit!
You can't hide in here.
Igor, the city needs me!
I've got money, technology, and power!
What do you ha...
He has friends!
How are you? OK?
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Take cover! Now!
Get out of here!
Think!
Think!
Think!
What's there to think about?
What's this pathetic movement about?
We don't accept
that kind of shit on our block.
Get them!!!
Sonny…
You're alive!
Fyodor Ivanovich.
Come on! Come on!
Go! Go!
You saved my life.
Twice.
Well, yeah.
Friends in need are friends indeed,
and all that.
I was wrong.
I'd never have managed it…
Without you.
Partner.
Are you going to kiss?
Hey, bad boy.
Why are you so happy?
You'll get a life sentence.
Really? Don't you get it?
The cops think
you're the Plague Doctor, Igor.
Think about it.
You escaped from the police station.
You're behind the bomb attack
and the street riots.
And then you attacked the one and only
Sergey Razumovskiy.
And you put this stupid costume on him.
I'll walk free,
and you'll get the life sentence.
Together with your…
Friends.
Look!
Think!
Do you know how many people have died?
How many more will die?
Does it matter?
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.
You know, I already made a video
on the true identity of the Plague Doctor,
and all that was missing
was this conversation.
Thank you.
Want to add anything?
But what did you achieve, Igor?
That everything will go back to normal?
Good job.
Do you really think I'm an idiot?
A stupid cop?
Who doesn't understand a damn thing?
You're a watchdog of the regime.
I see what's going on every day.
Only in the streets.
Not from the top floor of your tower.
The injustice, the lawlessness,
the rottenness of it all.
You think you're the only one
who wants to help people?
Have you read Dostoevsky?
You can't kill people.
Even the worst people.
Or else the whole world would go crazy.
Like you did.
I was this city's only hope.
Our city can survive without you.
It took them forever.
Fyodor Ivanovich, I…
- I thought you…
- Easy, easy.
It's OK. I'm fine.
Don't even dream about it, OK?
Hello, my little friend.
Do it.
Did you do it alone again?
Fyodor Ivanovich.
My friends helped me.
What's the party for? I don't get it.
Easy.
Well, General, sir?
We'll have a nice talk later.
About your pension.
And you lovebirds,
you'll go make mittens
in a Siberian labor camp.
Any questions?
- Let's get back to work, guys.
- Yes sir.
- Get back to work.
- Hello.
I'm Yulia Pchyolkina.
Nice to meet you. Can I get a photo?
- Yes, sure.
- Everyone get in, please.
Dubin. Get in the picture.
Don't say a word. Just smile.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Why didn't you…
Introduce her to me before?
Well…
What's that?
Invite her to dinner at my place, OK?
- What…
- Yes, you heard me.
That's my leather jacket.
Fyodor Ivanovich, I…
And that's my bike.
My bike.
Igor…
This is…
This is mine.
Easy, scumbags!
Easy!
I peeped out of the window
and saw a showdown.
I called the guys. We're a gang.
We went out and I was like…!
Got it? That's what I did.
And then the cops arrived and…
{\an8}The Plague Doctor affair
has taken a truly unexpected turn.
{\an8}The killer turned out
to be Sergey Razumovskiy,
{\an8}the founder of social network Vmeste.
{\an8}Yevgeniy Strelkov,
who personally arrested the criminal
{\an8}promised to do his best
to expedite the legal proceedings.
After the Plague Doctor's true intentions

Today the authorities announced the launch
of a large-scale judicial reform.

public response to these events
{\an8}confirms just how urgently
these changes are needed.
Thanks.
Wow!
Awesome!
Igor, how did you find this place?

Yulia, that's you!
- Igor, that's not funny.
- What?
- It is!
- Yulia, don't look!
- Take it easy! Come on!
- Igor, I'm not kidding!
- Igor, leave him alone.
- If you say so.
BAR
BOOM! BAM!
Veniamin Samuilovich.
Do you want to sedate him?
No need, Sofia.
He's a very unusual case.
A very interesting one.
Don't worry.
We'll get out of here soon.
