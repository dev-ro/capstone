I'm not
coming out, you hear me?
I'm not coming out.
I want everyone gone... you,
your men, snipers, everyone.
If I don't see taillights
in the next five minutes,
you're not gonna like
what happens next.
Ray?
Can you get him back
on the phone?
He's done talking.
Do it.
Yes, sir.
Gold Unit, this is HR1.
Move to green.
Ma'am, come with me.
FBI, show me your hands!
Hands!
Turn around!
Oh, shit.
- Got him clean, boss.
- Ben, no.
He's not carrying.
Ray. Ray, look at me.
It's all over.
I didn't want it
to end like this.
It's not supposed
to end like this.
Put your son down
and step away.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Good.
No!
Command, this is Navy

I need more saline over here!
Dr. McCullen, Surgery, please.
Three, two, one, lift.
He's ready for you, Lieutenant.
You're gonna be okay.
From the Great Pyramid of Giza
to the Tower of Babel,
brick by brick
and stone by stone,
mankind has been consumed
by one singular desire:
to touch the sky.
Perhaps finally,
we've done it.
The brainchild
of former tech magnate,
Zhao Long Ji.
- Zhao Long Ji.
- Zhao Long Ji.
Visionary entrepreneur,
Zhao Long Ji.
...who has
spared no expense creating
this city in the sky,
going so far as to build
a 30-story vertical park
at the building's center.
The Pearl speaks
to what we can achieve
when we don't accept
limitations.
This isn't just
another building.
Tallest building on Earth.
This high-tech high-rise
generates all
of its energy needs
from a massive double helix
wind turbine near its top.
Dwarfing the Burj Khalifa
and tripling the height
of the venerable
Empire State Building.
- Over 3,000 feet.
- The Pearl.
The Pearl's lower half
has delighted the public
for six months.
It's residential upper half
has yet to open its doors.
Buildings shape our society.
- Better buildings...
- ...better cities.
A better world.
But it's
the mysterious sphere
that has the world buzzing.
In a statement released today,
the secretive billionaire
confirmed that despite rumors
of an inability to fully insure
a structure this size,
plans to open the building's
upper half remain on track.
He promises that
the sphere will be
the number one tourist
attraction in the world,
with views of Hong Kong...
The screens go off,
shoes go on.
It's panda time.
Where's your dad? I need him
to fix my phone before we go.
- Bathroom.
- Okay.
He's talking to himself again.
Ah, screw it. I'm just gonna
high-five the guy.
You okay?
Yeah.
- Yeah, just some leg stuff, you know.
- Mm.
Well, you look very handsome.
You think so?
- Mm-hmm.
- Does it look like I'm trying too hard?
No, it looks respectful.
Maybe I lose the tie?
No, but you should learn
to tie one. Come here.
I can hear your gears turning.
What's going on?
I just don't want to
screw it up, you know.
You're not gonna screw it up.
I don't know.
What if I missed something?
Baby, there's no way
you've missed something.
You've been preparing for
this meeting for six months.
I've never seen you
work harder on anything.
You're ready for this.
You know this place
better than the architect.
You're gonna do great.
They flew you out here
for a reason.
They want to hear
what you have to say.
Yeah, hope so.
Ben stuck his neck out for me
and then, you know,
this could be a real
game-changer for us.
They give stuff like this
to big companies.
I work out of our garage.
Yeah, it's a good garage.
Okay, look, just because
you're a smaller company
does not mean
that you don't belong
and, for the record,
Ben stuck his neck out for you
because he's your friend
and that's what friends do.
Hey. Look at me.
Look at me.
You've got this.
I love you.
You better.
- Come here.
- My phone isn't working.
Oh, so was all the, uh,
"Hey, look at me,
you've got this,
you look so handsome,"
just a way
of buttering me up
to fix your phone again?
It's a distinct possibility.
Okay.
All right, well,
what do I tell you to do
any time something's wrong
with your phone?
Try turning it off
and on again.
Try turning it
off and on again.
90% of the time,
you can fix a problem by
turning it off and on again.
So, did you, uh, try
turning it off and on again?
Nope. I like it better
when you do it.
It gives you a sense
of accomplishment.
Oh, I see. So you're asking me
to fix your phone for-for me?
You're welcome.
Put your coats in your bags.
All right, kids. You guys
are gonna go see pandas.
Pandas.
Daddy's gonna go make
that bacon.
Let me ask you a question.
- Daddy loves who?
- Me.
- Daddy loves who?
- Me.
- Daddy loves who?
- Me! Me! - Me! Me!
- Can't hear you. Can't hear you.
- Me! - Me!
- Confidence. Not confident.
- Me! Me!
- Daddy loves who?
- Me! Me! - Me!
Okay, okay, you know what?
You're both right
- because Daddy loves you both.
- Aw...
I got to get a chant.
- You fixed it?
- As always.
You really do love me.
- Eh, kinda.
- Come here.
Mmm.
Gross.
Floor 98.
My brother.
Brother.
Get in here.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Sarah, you look beautiful.
Mm, thank you.
It's so good to see you.
- Come on.
- Right?
- You're kidding me.
- I know.
These are the twins?
They're so big now.
What are you guys up to?
- We're going to see the pandas.
- I heard.
This'll get you in to see
the nighttime panda feeding.
- Oh...
- After everybody's left.
Very hard to come by.
- Thank you.
- But I know a lot of pandas, so.
There you go.
Some gear,
just to look the part.
- What do you guys say?
- Thank you.
Get out of here, go have fun.
I'll see you tonight, honey.
Good luck.
- Love you.
- See you guys.
- Bye.
- Bye.
What's up?
Good to see you.
Wow.
Hey, look.
Thanks for putting in
a good word.
I know my company's small
for something this size.
Come on.
It's nothing.
Just doing my job.
They're dying
to open the upper half.
And they needed somebody
to check the math
on their safety
and security systems.
Plus, you were cheaper
than anyone else.
A lot... cheaper.
Like half.
Floor 220.
Oh.
So subtle?
Yep. Solid titanium.
Nothing says, "Welcome to
my penthouse panic room"
like ten inches of
military-grade super alloy.
Ready to meet Oz?
Well, I think so.
Wow.
I mean, I guess
if you got to live somewhere...
Right?
Mr. Sawyer.
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you.
Oh.
You know, I, um...
I'm kidding.
Oh. Thank God.
My, uh, my wife
only taught me one phrase.
Sarah, right? She's a Naval
surgeon, isn't she?
She is. She also minored in
language and East Asian studies
- at Annapolis.
- And your twins,
Henry and Georgia.
You know your stuff.
You are the very first family
we have had in the residential
section of The Pearl.
I thought it might be
a good test for us.
Well, they absolutely love it.
It's their first visit
to Hong Kong.
Ah, here they are.
Allow me to introduce my head
of personal security,
Ajani Okeke,
and Mr. Pierce,
from the Hawthorne-Stone
Insurance Group.
A pleasure.
- Very nice to meet you, Mr. Sawyer.
- Likewise.
After your independent third-
party assessment is approved,
they will confirm full coverage
of The Pearl,
which I'm told will carry
the most expensive premium
for a single structure
in underwriting history.
So, shall we begin?
Can't wait.
The Pearl's anti-fire measures
employ a one-of-a-kind
self-sealing ventilation system
and a robust sprinkler
and CO2 array
which can put out a fire
in a fraction of the time.
All monitored
by a control facility
located over a mile away.
You hired me to assess your
safety and security systems
and after a complete analysis,
I can say that it's the safest
supertall structure
in the world.
It's Fort Knox,
a mile in the sky.
Once I inspect the security
at the off-site facility,
my job will be done,
and you can open
the residential upper half.
Thank you.
You were the right man
for the job.
Just like Ben said.
This tablet will give you
administrative access
to The Pearl's fire
and safety control measures.
Once linked
to your biometric data,
you'll be the only one
who can access it.
Ben will take you
to our off-site facility
so you can make sure
everything checks out.
Thank you.
If we hurry,
there's still time.
Time for what?
For you to see it.
- Go.
- Yeah.
This... is the real pearl.
317 motion-sensitive
projection panels
make this sphere the eighth
wonder of the world.
Wow.
It's incredible.
I'm over there.
In here, anything is possible.
The sphere is comprised
of nearly 25,000
ultra high-definition panels
with embedded 8K microcameras
on both sides.
Both sides?
Why is that?
Whoa.
Welcome to heaven, Mr. Sawyer.
Oh, God. "Welcome to heaven"?
- He really said that?
- Yeah.
- But, like, cool or creepy?
- Uh, little of both.
God, rich guys.
- You work for them though.
- Eh.
You ever miss it?
The team?
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, but things are
a lot different now.
I-I... I got a wife and kids,
and I haven't touched a gun
in ten years.
- You're kidding.
- No.
What's that about?
Well, after what happened...
...I just... kind of
put my sword down, you know?
I laid it down, and... I'm just
never gonna pick it up again.
Come on. He was unarmed.
You know,
he was wearing a vest.
There's no way
you could've known that.
Just bad luck, that's all.
Maybe.
You know, the funny thing is,
without that bad luck, I, uh...
I never would've met Sarah.
I never would've had my kids.
I don't know who I'd be
without my family.
I'd be... I'd be lost,
- and I'd be...
- Me.
Come on, man, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.
Come on.
Relax. I'm kidding.
Oh. We're here. Come on.
The kids are really excited
about the nighttime feeding.
Yeah, it's a blast.
They'll be there all night.
- Thanks for taking me to the off-site.
- No worries.
I mean, dinner's on you,
of course.
Hey.
He's got my bag!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Oh, man. It's nasty.
- Yeah.
- Better get that cleaned up, huh?
- Well, this feels familiar.
- Yeah.
You're gonna need some stitches
for that though, man.
- That's a nasty cut, bro.
- Uh-huh.
- I'm gonna call Sarah.
- Yeah.
Is that Zhao's tablet?
Yeah, I put it in my jacket
before we left.
How's that for luck, huh?
Yeah, man. Nice one.
Thought we were both
gonna get fired for that.
Hey. How are the pandas?
Floor 98.
Well, we didn't really
get to see them
because Henry ate a weird candy
and started throwing up,
so we came back.
Is he okay?
Did he have an attack?
No, he's breathing fine.
Just, you know, no pandas,
which sucks.
- It sucks.
- Don't say "sucks," honey.
I'll take you there tomorrow,
okay, if you're feeling better.
- I'll see you soon.
- Okay. Bye.
Oh, sorry, miss.
Building maintenance.
W-We thought
this floor was empty.
Uh... yeah, me, too.
- Everything okay?
- Everything's fine.
We're just checking
the phone lines.
I didn't know
they were active yet.
Well, they will be
when we finish with them.
Ah.
Well, look at
this precious little pair.
Are you having fun?
You got the run of the castle
on this floor.
Not too bad
for a big strong knight
and a beautiful
little princess.
I'm a king.
A thousand apologies,
Your Majesty.
Come on, guys.
They were supposed to be gone.
- I know.
- Want me to clean that up?
No. Leave it.
It'll take care of itself.
- What's up? Where you going?
- Ah, I got to go.
Henry's not feeling well.
They went back to The Pearl.
- They went back to The Pearl?
- Yeah.
All right.
I'll call you tonight.
What a day, huh?
You're not gonna make it
in time.
What?
Why'd you take it
out of the bag?
You should've just
left it in the bag.
Ben, what are you
talking about?
Give me the tablet, Will.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What's going on?
- What's going on?
You screw up,
you get a whole new life.
What do I get?
Hmm? Medical discharge?
Working for thugs?
You don't know
these people, Will.
I don't have a choice,
'cause you messed it up.
I know you're hurting, brother,
but you don't want to do this.
We're not brothers.
Ben. Stop! Stop!
Stop!
Come here.
Here, stay with me.
Let's get you up. Come on, let's go. Sit up.
There we go.
Let's get you over here.
Okay, here, stay with me.
Hold this here. Hold it tight.
I need you to tell me what happened, okay?
All right? I can help you
if you tell me what happened.
They weren't supposed
to go back, Will.
They weren't
supposed to be there.
Who wasn't supposed
to be there?
Sarah... and the kids.
What did you do?
Light a man's house on fire...
and you find out
what he truly loves.
Shelter in place.
Mom? What's going on?
Anti-fire measures activated.
I don't know. Let me go check.
Shelter
in place.
Anti-fire measures activated.
Stay on the couch.
Should we evacuate?
Evacuate?
Yes, take a helicopter.
Why would we do that?
Well, the building's on fire.
The building isn't on fire.
The 96th floor is on fire.
We're more than
a hundred stories above that,
and the anti-fire measures
will keep it there.
We're perfectly safe here,
I assure you.
What did you do?
I set you up.
They need the tablet.
Run.
They're coming, Will.
They're gonna kill you.
Who's coming? Who?
- Run.
- Ben?
Ben?
Shit!
Hello, Will.
Thank you.
Go!
Anti-fire measures activated.
Okay, guys, in the bathroom.
- Shelter in place.
- Come on.
- Anti-fire measures activated.
- Come here, bud.
I'm fine, Mom. I don't need it.
You're fine now, honey, but
we're about to go out there,
and there's a lot of smoke
and a lot of bad air,
and we don't want you
to have an attack, okay?
Georgia, dunk them all the way.
Make sure they get
completely wet,
- the hand towels, too.
- Okay.
Two quick inhales please.
Mom?
Are we gonna die?
Anti-fire measures activated.
No. Baby, we are not gonna die.
We are gonna be just fine.
I promise.
We're in position
at the off-site
control facility.
Do it.
There you are. Baby, there's
a-a fire in the building.
I know.
All right, look,
I can't get to you.
The police have the entire
building locked down.
I want you to get
out of there right now.
Go inside the hallway; there
should be a logistics panel.
If you show it to me, I can
tell you where it's safe to go.
Take the kids with you.
I'm gonna stay on the phone.
Okay.
Hand me those towels.
Come on.
Occupancy warning on floor 98.
Will Sawyer's family
unlocked their apartment door
an hour ago.
They're in the building.
Send two men.
Use the manual override code
on the elevators.
- Bring them here.
- Yes, sir.
You two, go.
What? Listen, the fire
isn't just gonna go out.
We need to leave now.
Security
alert.
I can only access
nominal control.
I can't lock out
the on-site functions
without the...
...root access.
Okay.
We're in.
The entire system
has been compromised.
I'm completely locked out.
What do you mean
you're locked out?
I thought that couldn't happen.
We have full control
of the anti-fire systems.
Seal all the fire doors
from 95 to the ground.
And disable all anti-fire
measures from 96 to the top.
Everything's gonna be okay.
The logistics panel
should be to your left.
Tell me what you see.
Okay, hon.
All the floors above us are
yellow. What does that mean?
It means the entire fire system
above you is offline.
Sarah, listen to me.
The fire is not gonna stop.
I want you to get outta there
right now and go up.
- Go up, keep going up, don't stop, don't look back.
- Okay.
Now force the fire up.
Open the elevator shaft
air vents
and feed it with fresh oxygen.
Let it burn.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you
a $6.5 billion chimney.
Mrs. Sawyer?
We're with
the building security.
Come with us, please.
- No! Get back!
- Run!
No! No!
What is your status? Report.
Do you copy?
No one could survive that.
They're gone.
We're moving into position.
You know what to do next.
Go, hurry, up the stairs.
Sarah.
...Will Sawyer.
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, please.
You don't understand.
My family's inside.
Listen to me.
I have to get to them.
So, you have full systems
control from the tablet.
There's no
facial recognition needed.
All other access points
to The Pearl mainframe
have been encrypted.
The entire building now,
it's locked out.
I used my own logarithmic
base cipher to encrypt it
so I am literally the only
human on the planet Earth
that can crack this.
Yeah, it's pretty smart, right?
Not that smart.
If the fire continues to climb,
it will superheat the air
around the helipad,
making liftoff impossible.
Our departure window
is closing, sir.
I hate to say it,
but it is now or never.
Warning.
Anti-fire measures offline.
Happy?
You got to play the hero,
it didn't work,
it's time to go.
All right, Mr. Pierce.
You'll get your wish.
Get the helo ready.
Prep the bird.
Yes, sir.
Sir?
Yes, sir.
Shit.
Sir, I can't protect you
if you don't tell me
what's going on.
This isn't just a fire.
It's a plot.
- I can't say for sure.
- I don't need facts.
What is your gut telling you?
Who's behind this?
Kores Botha.
I don't understand.
If a man like Botha
wanted you dead,
there are easier ways.
He doesn't want me dead.
At least not yet.
He wants this.
And lighting The Pearl on fire
is the only way he can get it.
Is there something
I should know?
Yes. The helicopter is ready.
Sorry, boys.
Oh.
Shit.
Go!
Go, go, go!
- Hands up!
- Okay.
Don't shoot.
Turn around.
Yes.
This way.
You're doing great.
Wait, hold on.
Come here.
- Baby, we're gonna wet these again, okay?
- Okay, Mommy.
Okay, baby.
Calm down. Calm down.
Okay, one second.
What's that sound?
It's the fire, baby.
- Where are we gonna go?
- I don't know.
That's the bridge
to the waterfall.
We'll keep heading up.
Run! Go!
Come on. Up the stairs.
Okay.
Keep going.
Don't stop.
Wait.
What is it?
That is not our pilot.
Botha.
Get down!
Go, go!
Long time, Botha.
Yeah. Did you miss me?
I see you met my associate.
Surprise, surprise.
Why don't you just shoot me
and take it?
You think I'm stupid? Huh?
You know I can't do that.
'Cause the men I work for
will kill me if I don't get it
back for them.
You should've paid me
and been done with it. But no.
Clever boys like you always
think you can be clever.
So how's this for clever?
I'm gonna take you
and your drive
and your helicopter.
And I'm going to make you watch
as your building burns to ash
and there's nothing
you can do about it.
Look out!
Zhao!
Zhao! Zhao!
Yes.
He sealed himself
in the penthouse.
Open the doors.
The penthouse floor
has its own subroutine.
Zhao must have
isolated that system.
I can't open the doors
with this tablet.
Wait. It looks like
Will Sawyer's in the building.
And I've got a movement alert.
It's his family.
They're still alive.
Zhao!
You're not gonna get in
using force.
You need someone
who knows the system.
And I know just the man
for the job.
Sawyer.
If anyone can get in, it's him.
He's in the building.
Just need to find him.
We don't need to find him.
We know what he wants.
If you can't fix it
with duct tape...
...then you ain't using
enough duct tape.
All right, you were
on the 98th floor,
east side stairwell.
Means you would've had to go
through the park.
I'll find you.
Hang on. I'll find you.
Stay with me, baby. Okay? Okay.
Come on. Almost there.
- Mrs. Sawyer.
- Yes.
Nice to meet you.
I got them.
They're in the park.
Come on.
- Kids, too.
- Do what he says. Okay?
That's right.
Listen to your mummy.
It's okay, guys.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Just do exactly what I say.
Run! Run!
- Mom!
- Come on!
Okay. Come on.
Just have to go up
a little bit farther.
Georgia!
Henry!
I'll find another way up.
Keep going. Go all the way
up to the waterfall.
I'll go around
to the other side.
- I'll meet you there.
- Okay.
I'm not supposed to kill you,
but I think your kids
will be enough.
Sarah!
Hmm?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Come here.
How did you get
in the building?
It's a long story.
Where are the kids?
- Mom! Dad!
- Oh, God, are you okay?
- Don't move, all right?
- Where's your sister?
She's at the top of the park
by the waterfall.
Dad!
- Honey, stay right there. Daddy's coming for you.
- Okay.
How do we get across the bridge?
Let's figure this out.
It's gonna be okay, baby.
Okay.
Shit.
The bridge is unstable.
- All right, we got to do this together.
- Okay.
When I tell you to,
walk it out, drop it,
- and go get him, okay? All right.
- Okay.
What are you gonna do? Will?
I'm gonna hold
the bridge steady.
Hold on, baby.
- Okay.
- Go!
Okay, baby, here I come.
Here I come.
Okay.
Oh, I got you. I got you.
Okay. Come back, hurry!
That's it. That's it.
Come back. Come on.
Okay. As still as you can.
Okay, we're almost there.
- No!
- Mom!
You can do it. You can do it.
That's it. Get up.
I can't hold it anymore!
Jump!
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Come on. Will,
what the hell is going on?
I don't know, but I got to get
you guys out of this building.
- Henry can't breathe.
- I know.
It's okay.
- Georgia, I'll be right there!
- Okay, Dad.
Okay.
All right,
these elevators operate
on electromagnetic induction.
When there's a fire,
they're held in place
by a fail-safe brake.
When I cut this cable,
you're gonna fall.
- What? Will?
- It's all right.
Just listen to me. You're gonna
fall through the fire.
The magnets are gonna kick back
on once you pass the fire line.
But I need you
to pull this handle
in order to engage
the braking system.
It's about 500 feet
from here until the fire line.
I want you to count to five
and pull the handle.
- This is crazy.
- Trust me.
Okay.
How you doing, buddy?
I'm scared.
It's okay to be scared.
In order to be brave,
we got to be a little scared.
All right? Now I need you
to be brave right now.
- Can you do that for me?
- Yeah.
I want you to hold on
to your mom.
- Daddy loves who?
- Me.
That's right.
Come here. Okay.
Okay.
Okay, baby.
We're gonna sit down.
We're gonna brace ourselves,
all right?
Okay.
I love you.
You better.
Count with me, baby. Five...
...four...
...three...
...two... one!
Mom!
Okay.
- Hey!
- Oh, God.
Hey, hey. It's okay.
It's okay.
We're the good guys.
You're safe. Come with us.
Daddy! Daddy!
Found you.
You little shit.
Georgia!
Come on.
Okay.
Just the man I was looking for.
Your Majesty.
I hear your dad knows
everything about this building.
All I care about is
what my business partner
is holding behind those doors.
And you're going
to get it for me.
Listen to me.
The only way those doors open
is from the inside,
or the fire alarm
on this floor triggers it,
but that can't happen because
you took
the entire system offline.
Is that so? Well, let me
tell you something.
Every man has a weakness.
It's easy to find.
Once you know what he loves,
you have it.
Zhao, he loves this building.
And you, your weakness
is your family.
So now we're going to find out
how much you love
your family, Will.
Listen to me.
Opening those doors
from this floor can't be done.
Anything can be done
with the proper motivation.
- No, no, no, no! No, no...
- Daddy!
Don't hurt him! Stop!
Okay, cuzzie.
You're gonna bring Zhao
and what he's holding
behind those doors to me.
Or I'm gonna throw your
daughter off the fucking roof.
I hear it's like
heaven up there.
- No, no, no! Daddy! No!
- No. Georgia! Georgia! No!
Straight to the roof, boys.
We're not gonna
wait around here to burn.
No!
Daddy!
Daddy! Let me go!
Daddy, help me!
Daddy!
Georgia!
...into the destruction
of Zhao Long Ji's Pearl tower.
We're getting reports
of activity
on the ground floor
of the building.
We're going to go live
to Kowloon Plaza,
where we may have
some survivors
coming out of the building.
It's difficult to imagine
how anyone could have survived
the raging fire on the upper floors.
My dad's inside. He saved us.
- He-He's still inside.
- Is there any other news?
He's a good guy!
It appears this may be
the family of William Sawyer,
the American
security consultant...
Okay. There's got to be
a way to open these doors.
Where did you put
the subroutine panels
that controls them?
Where did you hide it, Zhao?
Behind the turbines?
Oh, come on, man.
Shit.
How did you get
out of the building?
Can you comment?
And you claim
your husband isn't involved?
It's not a claim.
He's not involved.
How many of them
did you say you saw?
One in a suit,
two others in coveralls.
The one that I spoke to,
he had an accent.
Scandinavian, I think.
Six-foot, white, muscular.
There. Top row.
Second from the right.
- Is this the man you saw?
- That's him. Who is he?
Kores Botha. Ex-military.
Has a nasty crew with him, too.
High-end muscle for three
different crime syndicates.
Excuse me?
One of them was
carrying a container,
and it had a logo with wings
on it, and the word "Sirin."
Look it up.
This is stupid.
This is The Pearl.
A BASE jump from 1,000 meters
up gives you roughly
about two kilometers
descent distance.
Now, if you're right,
they will land somewhere
within this circle.
Somewhere open and flat,
secluded.
Now, they wouldn't
go for Victoria Park.
There's too many trees
to get hung up on.
South, they wouldn't
clear the peak.
North, maybe, but it's
a longer haul to an open spot.
What about this? What's that?
That's nothing.
It's a construction site.
Bay Dredge.
You think I would
willingly trap
my own children
in a burning building?
I think you could be
playing a role.
This could all be
part of your husband's plan.
Take me there.
If I am wrong and it's empty,
then what have you lost?
But if I am right,
this might be your only chance
to catch the people responsible
for this whole thing.
My family is in there.
Please.
Oh, my God.
Come on, baby. Come on.
Come on.
Two, three.
One, two, three.
Okay, easy.
Just cut the wire,
doors will open,
climb back up there.
Okay.
Shit!
Oh, come on.
Yeah!
Does that look like someone
with a plan to you?
Now do you believe me?
Don't move.
- You're too close.
- What?
We need to talk.
All right, if we're gonna
get outta here,
you're gonna have
to tell me the truth.
How does a man like that
call you his business partner?
His name is Kores Botha.
He handles extortion for three
powerful crime syndicates.
And when I began construction
on The Pearl, Botha came to me.
He said that
if I didn't pay him,
he'll cripple my labor force,
and keep me from
ever completing this place.
- You paid him.
- Yes.
But what he didn't know
was that I hid
tracking software
inside my wire transfer.
As Botha laundered my payments
through their
offshore accounts,
I was able to trace
every transaction,
giving me their bank accounts,
their names,
their identities.
This was my insurance policy.
Botha would never be able
to extort money from me again.
But when the syndicates
found out
that they were compromised,
they threatened
to destroy Botha
if he didn't clean up
his mess.
If he kills me,
the copies I've made
will be sent
to the authorities.
But if he gets his hands
on this, the original,
he can reverse engineer
my tracking software
and hide the identities
before anyone's the wiser.
So he lit this entire building
on fire
knowing that you would take
the most valuable thing
in this world to you and run.
- And his plan worked.
- Not yet, it hasn't.
We're gonna give Botha
what he came here for.
As soon as he has the drive,
he'll kill us both.
Maybe.
But he has my daughter.
And her life is what matters
to me, not mine.
Now, I'm taking that drive
to the roof.
You could either be
attached to it or not.
It's your choice, Zhao.
All right.
So, what's the plan?
You got any duct tape?
- Daddy!
- Hey!
Mr. Sawyer, see,
I knew you'd find a way.
You have what's mine,
and I have what's yours.
Give me the drive.
- And bring Zhao.
- No.
My daughter first.
- I can't let you do this.
- Hey, what are you doing?
- This is not in the plan.
- Turn around.
He's got my daughter.
Please, don't do this to me.
Turn around!
I want a parachute!
You need me alive.
A parachute or you get nothing.
- Give him your parachute.
- Huh?
Give him your parachute.
Bring it here.
Stop. Drop it there.
Come. Bring the drive.
Here's what you want?
Go get it.
Run!
Doors! Come on!
Georgia.
Daddy!
It looks like you were right.
We've got armed suspects
up ahead.
Stay down, don't leave the car.
Thanks.
You almost had me convinced
out there.
Let's go find your daughter.
Go, go, go!
Hey.
Easy, easy. Easy.
Go. Go get her.
I'm coming back for you.
Turn around.
Turn around now!
You shoot me,
I drop this and the girl.
Daddy!
Disarm now!
No, please! Daddy!
All right.
You win.
It's gonna be okay, honey.
It's gonna be okay.
Now toss me the drive.
All right.
But there's one thing
you should know first.
What?
I'm behind you.
I got you.
I got you. I got you.
Daddy's got you.
What's that?
I don't know,
she had it on her.
It looks like
it controls the building.
Hey, let's wait for someone
who knows what they're doing.
My husband and daughter
are in that building,
it's on fire right now.
I'm not gonna wait
another damn second.
Yes, sir.
Come here.
Stay down, stay low.
I'm gonna find us
a way outta here.
Okay.
What are you doing?
I'm trying to bring
the fire systems back online.
Is it working?
Not yet.
Daddy!
Come here, come here.
Come here.
Come on. Come on.
Daddy's got you.
Daddy's got you.
Daddy's got you.
I got you.
I got you.
Look at me. Look at me.
- Daddy loves who?
- Me.
Daddy loves you.
Daddy, Daddy loves you.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
I'm so sorry.
It worked.
How the hell did you do that?
I rebooted the control systems
for the entire building.
I turned it off and on again.
Zhao! Zhao, let's go.
Let's go. Come on.
Here.
What are you gonna do now?
Rebuild.
- One question.
- Sarah.
Has anyone seen my wife?
What about my son?
- Mr. Sawyer...
- Henry!
Sarah!
Henry!
Sarah!
Mom!
Dad!
You okay? You okay?
Are you hurt?
- No, no, we're okay.
- I'm okay, Dad.
We're fine. We're fine.
I love you.
I love you, too.
You really need a shower.
Yes, I do.
- Let's go home.
- Oh, yeah.
Will Sawyer.
Nice to finally meet you.
You've got
quite a family there.
I'm a lucky man.
