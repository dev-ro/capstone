- Don´t take one before they´re done.
- Shit! Relax!
There are only three small ones
for each. You know that.
Now you´ve mixed them.
That´s not very bright.
Hi, Bjarne.
This is Beate.
She´s a teacher at Tina´s school.
- l thought it would only be us.
- She just dropped by.
Come on over and sit down, Bjarne.
- Bjarne is shy.
- l know what that´s like.
- So opening your own shop, huh?
- lt´s a big challenge.
- Svend is really bad with problems.
- What?
- l am too. What do you mean?
- When you don´t get attention ...
- Then what? What?
- Whatever.
And why shouldn´t it work?
lf Holger can succeed, so can we.
- He has his Deersausage.
- You say ´´sausage´´ all the time.
- What do you have?
- My Marinade.
Give Bjarne a steak.
lsn´t it tough to be a butcher?
lsn´t it a mess ofblood and stuff?.
- No.
- lt must be exciting too.
How many pigs could you
slaughter in one day?
1,100.
1,100?
Have you always
wanted to be a butcher?
lt must be lonely in that
kitchen with all that blood and ...
What are you doing?
Did you just kick me?
Shit!
What the fuck are you doing?
- Why did you invite me?
- You need professional help.
- l´m not up forthat shit.
- You don´t have to kick her.
That´s just your version.
.. and also two Deersausages.
They are absolutely marvelous.
What is your secret,
if l may ask?
lt´s a long story. l´ve always
been fascinated by sausages.
lt´s almost mythological
to kill an animal -
- and then mock it
by sticking it in its own intestine.
Can you image anything worse
than being stuck up your own ass?
- No, l don´t think so.
- That´s one of Our small pleasures.
He´s doing it again.
No, no, no ...
Look ...
He´s doing it again.
You can´t run a business like that.
l don´t get why people come back.
- They want the sausage.
- Don´t say sausage all the time.
l can make a sausage way better
that this bunch ofjunk.
What did you say, asshole?
Nothing.
- Delusions of grandeur, huh?
- Svend is just talking. lt´s nothing.
- You are an embarresment to me.
- What do you mean by that?
l can´t sell Bjarne´s pate.
lt tastes like jockstrap -
- and your marinade and meatballs
aren´t flying overthe counter.
My marinade may need some work,
but don´t disparage my meatballs.
They are so fucking tough that you
could blow them up like balloons.
Let me stand behind the counter.
Why should we be hidden away?
You´ll never stand behind the
counter, and do you know why?
Because you sweat,
and you´re too disgusting.
This isn´t working. Can´t you see it?
We need to open our own shop.
Svend, you have sausage
on your head again.
- Hello again.
- Hello.
- This is my partner Bjarne.
- Hello.
Just call me House Hans. You can
just ponderwhy for a moment.
- Yeees ...
- lsn´t it because you sell houses?
Yes.
Yes ...
Bjarne, come on out here
and have look.
There you have it.
Look here.
Here we have a bone crusher.
Look at these tiles.
They´re almost intact.
Come on.
We just need a bit ofbeefher, some
pig there and some chickens her.
Svend, relax.
- What do you say?
- lt´s fine, but it´s a lot of money.
- What do you mean?
- Two million is a lot of money.
That´s a strange number
to throw around.
He said one million each.
- Yes, and that makes two million.
- l don´t want to discuss that.
l´m planning to mortgage
my house all the way.
l don´t have a house.
What am l supposed to do?
- Then it just stops here.
- What do you want me to do?
FJELDSTED SANATORlUM
SANATORlUM
lf we had known you were coming,
we would have cut his hair.
lt´s okay.
The resemblance is uncanny.
lt is with many twins
l think it´s pretty common.
Yes, so ...
He´s in here.
You´ve never been here before,
have you?
No.
l haven´t seen him for seven years.
- He´ll neverwake up again, will he?
- No. He´s completely brain dead.
- Then turn him off.
- Why, all of a sudden?
lt´s the best decision.
His organs will benefit others.
- But you never answered our letters.
- l don´t open all my mail.
- l wrote you a letter every month.
- Really? Can´t you just turn it off?.
Of course.
- But may l ask ...
- l need money.
He has one million from our parents
that l´ll get as his only heir.
- When he´s just lying there ...
- Of course. lt´s best for everybody.
Fine.
What was he like?
When you look at someone each day,
you wonderwhat they were like.
No. lt´s crooked again.
Are you really unable to see that?
Give me a break.
lt looks fine.
Fine? ls fine okay?
l don´t think so.
Let me tell you,
you can´t drink 19 beers -
- and then judge
whether something is straight.
lt´s nice and straight now, huh?
lt looks fine.
Now it´s okay.
Secure it properly.
Exactly.
Just like that.
- Don´t we need light in here?
- Yes, when we find an electrician.
- What happened to the one we had?
- l fired him.
He was yakking constantly,
and that doesn´t fix the light. Come.
Please close the door.
Our business cards have arrived.
They´re just right.
With gold print and everything.
Just hand them out to people
you meet.
- Who am l going to meet?
- You´ll sort it out.
l bought 5,000,
so just get busy.
- Hi.
- Hello.
lsn´t it nice?
l´ve cleaned up a bit.
- Oh ...
- People come on the anniversary.
l noticed that it was
seven years ago today.
- You don´t come here often?
- No. lt´s my first time.
l thought that they were down there.
- ls it your parents?
- Yes.
- And your sister?
- No.
- She was my wife.
- Oh, okay.
Was it a car accident?
How did you know?
lt almost always is
when they´ve died on the same day.
l don´t want to disturb you.
l always ask too many questions.
lt´s okay.
Thank you fortidying up.
You´re welcome.
Excuse me.
Do you want to open
a butcher shop with me?
- What?
- We´re opening a shop tomorrow.
And ...
Let me give you a card.
We´ve had these cards made.
Oops ...
Oh, well ...
l have to give them to people.
Do you want to come?
Astrid, are you coming orwhat?
- We don´t have all day.
- No, sorry.
- l can´t come.
- Oh ...
l´ve got two cremations tomorrow.
l know what that´s like.
What was that? What did you
just do with that meatball?
lf we eat them all, there
won´t be any forthe customers.
l shouldn´t have to waste half my
opening hours telling you that.
- And what is that?
- Napkins forthe customers.
No, it certainly isn´t!
lt will ruin the entire presentation.
Could you just glance at the color
ofthe counter? lt´s green, isn´t it?
And the balloons?
They´re green.
Stop it, Svend! Or l´ll leave and
there won´t be any fucking wedding.
l´m not keeping any people away.
Excuse me.
We´ve been playing fortwo hours.
- The drum has a ferry to catch ...
- ls that so?
Then just get the fuck out ofhere.
Take yourfucking music and get lost.
Fuck off with your shitty music.
- You can´t treat them like that.
- Oh yes, l can.
- You´re an asshole.
- Relax.
lt isn´t Svend´s fault
that you bought the wrong napkins.
That´s what l´ve been saying,
but you don´t listen to me, Tina.
l had a point, didn´t l?
And then you just run out.
l had a point, didn´t l?
What am l doing wrong?
l thought l did everything right.
We have offers and decorations.
Why don´t we have any customers?
- l have to take a dump.
- Yes, do that.
- lt´s damn cold in there.
- lt´s a meat locker.
l´ll just get my coat.
lt´s going to take some time.
The wiring is a mess.
- Taste this marinade.
- No.
Smell this marinade.
Smell this marinade.
lt smells good, doesn´t it?
l smoke 20 joints a day.
l wouldn´t be able to smell it
if my hairwas on fire.
Are you just going to sit there? How
about doing something productive?
- Have you given out your card?
- Yes.
Yes?
How many?
l don´t know.
Afew.
- Go on in, Svend.
- Promise you´ll be there tonight.
No, l won´t be.
Go on.
lt´s absurd to break up now.
l´m on the verge ofbreaking through
to an enormous number of customers.
lt´s barbecue season.
lt´s no time to break up.
- People want steaks and ...
- Don´t talk about steaks!
Why do you say that?
l haven´t mentioned steaks.
This isn´t about steaks
or other meat dishes.
We´re just not right for each other.
You´re just like everybody else.
You don´t like me either.
l lost my parents,
when l was very young.
Enough with the parents.
l´ll make sure to get my stuff out
before you come home.
lf you really feel like that,
then why haven´t you left?
Why are you still sitting here?
- Just get out ofthe car.
- Don´t count on seeing me tonight.
- No.
- l´ll get out ofthe car.
But l know you. You can´t
manage without the sweet life.
Just sit there and be a martyr.
Let´s see you drive off,
or is it just empty threats?
Leave, Tina.
Leave.
- Holger ...
- So this is where you live.
No expense spared, huh?
l´ll just force my way through this
swarm of well-paying customers.
We´re not open.
Bjarne isn´t here yet.
- We don´t open until he´s here.
- Stop it, Svend. So how is business?
- Do you have many customers?
- Yes, l think so.
Great. Then you don´t have to
stand there sweating like a pig.
Please leave, Holger.
l would like that.
lt´s my right to be here.
l need to buy something.
- No, you don´t. Please leave.
- Show me what you can do.
The Rotary board of directors
are coming to dinner at my house.
We´ll be 12 plus me.
Can you manage that -
- or is this just
mahogany and gleaming tiles?
Svend Sweat.
Hello?
What?
Fuck!
Shit!
There, there.
- Let´s pull ourselves together.
- Yes.
lt was an accident.
We´ll just have to report it.
This isn´t good.
This isn´t good at all.
Listen,
we´ll just tell it like it is.
lt´ll be okay.
lt´ll be okay.
There should be
a handle on the inside.
This isn´t good.
Where is his leg?
- l don´t know.
- Listen to me.
Why does he have
one leg missing?
lt was because Holger came.
Tina has left me, because she says
that l talk too much about steaks.
- What have you done?
- l panicked.
- Holger provoked me.
- And what did you do?
l cut 13 fillets ofhis thigh
and put them in marinade.
Rotary were coming for a barbecue.
Are you insane?
Are you completely insane?
l panicked, okay?
Done is done.
Can´t we still report it?
lt was an accident.
l didn´t mean to kill him.
You just sold his thigh, dumbass.
You may have killed him by accident,
but then you chose to carve him up.
lt´s over.
We´re through, Svend.
l know.
l shouldn´t have done that last part.
l´m sorry.
What do we do now?
What do we do with him?
l don´t know. Throw him in the bone
crusher. Nobody knows he was here.
- What?
- He did the work offthe books.
Do you want to use
the bone crusher?
No, l´m trying to help.
You think of something then.
What about Holger´s guests?
What should we tell them?
Okay.
Put him in the bone crusher.
Let him hang until he´s frozen,
otherwise it´ll be too disgusting.
l´m glad you came.
They´re crazy.
What´s happening?
Holger had his dinner last night,
and now everybody wants more.
- They heard about it last night.
- About what?
- The fillets. They love them.
- What are you doing now?
l don´t want to disappoint them,
so l´m selling a bit more ofhim.
- l´ll kill you.
- Stop it!
lt doesn´t matterwhetherwe use
the bone crusher or sell him.
lt´s the best way to get rid ofhim.
You said it yourself.
- l never said that.
- Let´s say you didn´t.
They want this. We´re not forcing
them. l don´t have time forthis.
- Has Tina left?
- Yes.
Why should she stay
when l have left her?
- Can´t you see that you need help?
- That may be the case.
- Can´t you?
- Yes.
l don´t know what l´m doing.
l don´t know what l was thinking.
He was hanging there,
and l just wanted him gone.
l didn´t care how.
Pull yourselftogether.
Pull yourselftogether.
How?
He´s out there in pieces.
He´s out there, in the meat locker
and on the table. lt´s a mess.
- l´m going home now
- No.
Svend, no!
You´re not going home.
Get out there and get it overwith.
Yes, you will.
Yes, you will.
Get it overwith now.
Where were we?
Two chicky-wickies?
- Yes, please.
- Allrighty.
- Anything else?
- Two meatballs and one pate.
- And 200 grams of roast beef.
- Happy to oblige.
He´s going at it out back.
ls he cutting down a tree?
No, just working, as we say.
Asmall one like this?
There you go.
We´ll nevertalk about this again.
Tomorrow we just say that
there are no more chicken fillets ...
Chicky-wickies.
That´s what l call them.
Svend´s chicky-wickies.
Svend, stop it.
Yes, of course.
That´s that.
That´s that.
l nevertold you this -
- but my parents died
when l was very young.
Yes, you have.
Many times.
And l wasn´t popular at school
so l got beaten every day.
The other kids
were free to pick on me -
- because l didn´t have any parents.
Yes sirree.
They hit me
and stole my lunch money.
That´s why l´m so skinny.
l didn´t get anything to eat
before l began training as a butcher.
Sometimes they´d hit me with stuff.
With wood ...
And with flashlights ...
And with a green bicycle pump ...
- And with belts ...
- Enough with the examples.
lt doesn´t matter.
What are you trying to say?
l´m very well aware
that l´m not a charming person.
People have always treated me
rough. They´ve called me names.
They called me ... you know ...
- Svend Sweat?
- Yes, let me tell you ...
l was always afraid.
l was afraid to go to school.
l was afraid to die.
l was afraid of girls.
l was afraid of people -
- and to some extent l still am,
let me tell you.
But then l met Tina -
- and l thought that things would
get a lot better, but they didn´t.
That was when l decided
to open my own shop.
How the fuck did you work that out?
- Perhaps l didn´t say it right ...
- No.
l´m tired and confused.
We´ll see each othertomorrow.
But, Bjarne,
l would like ...
l can rephrase it.
l can put it more bluntly.
l´ve never been loved.
The cat is out ofthe bag.
- That´s it.
- And?
And today ... here ...
What l had here today
behind the counter, Bjarne ...
lt was fantastic.
lt was great.
People spoke to me differently.
They smiled at me.
Suddenly l was someone else
and l really liked that.
Don´t be angry, Bjarne -
- but we can´t open
tomorrow without more meat.
We can´t.
lt stops here. lt´s sick and l don´t
want to hear anymore about it.
That really hurt.
You´re insane.
lt´s only a problem to be insane
and not know it.
See you tomorrow.
I´m not here right now.
Leave a message.
It´s Ingrid Grith.
I know how you feeI -
- but I have to teII you that we´II
turn off you brother tomorrow.
His organs wiII be
used for transpIants.
We´re very gratefuI.
Have a nice evening.
- Hi.
- Hi.
l was just passing by.
- Do you always sit in there alone?
- Yes. Sometimes.
The undertaker leaves at four.
He doesn´t have time for it all.
ln the winterthere´s a lot to do.
Many give up at Christmas -
- so l help out.
lt´s more fun than feeding chickens.
- l hearthe shop is doing well.
- Oh, did you hearthat?
Everybody is talking about you.
Well ...
Yes, business is very good.
l thought ... when the chickens
have been fed ... have you eaten?
- No.
- Do you want to? l know a place.
Hello?
- House Hans?
- Yes ...
That´s actually why l´m here.
You should just call me
Hans from now on.
lt sounds silly anyway.
l guess you know that. You shouldn´t
make your job your identity.
Oh ... yes ...
ls that why you´re here?
l was in the neighborhood
so l thought l would drop by-
- and see how you were.
Everything is fine.
Does anyone know you´re here?
- No. Why do you ask?
- No reason, let me tell you ...
lt´s been a long day.
Lots of customers ...
Let´s look at the shop then.
Let´s start with the meat locker.
lt´s really great. Let me tell you ...
Dark and cold, huh?
lsn´t there any light?
Sure.
Over in the corner.
l´m really impressed.
You´ve done a great job.
Hello?
Hello, what happened?
l think the door closed.
Hello?
Let me out.
This isn´t funny.
Hello.
l´m sorry
l haven´t cleaned the place.
- l had a break-in ...
- When?
l don´t know.
Afew years ago.
lt´s okay.
All these skeletons.
Have you killed them all?
Yes, except the whale.
l know it´s a bit morbid,
but it´s been sort of a hobby.
- Like collecting coins.
- You collect skeletons.
lt sounds stupid, right? My
colleague Svend says that it´s sick.
How did you kill this one?
That one l killed
with a piece of cloth.
l don´t have any tea.
- l have lots of weed. Will that do?
- Yes, if you have milk and sugar.
Why are you so chipper?
What´s up with you?
- Nothing.
- Yes, what´s up with you?
- l´ve met a girl.
- Really?
- l´ve met a girl. lt´s nothing.
- Nothing?
Let me tell you,
it´s something.
We´re on ourway now.
Can´t you feel it?
- What the fuck are you wearing?
- Come with me.
These are our new uniforms.
They´re great, don´t you think?
- Yes, they´re very ...
- Come on.
- There´s a hat too.
- Yes.
Jesus fucking Christ!
Svend, you psycho.
You´ve gone completely insane.
l should like to explain.
Thank you.
Last night l went outside
and he was lying in the street.
Bjarne, it´s him.
lt´s our realtor.
- ls that House Hans?
- He just wants to be called Hans.
Let me finish.
There he was. Dead as a doornail.
l just took him inside.
- We have to report it.
- He was already dead. That´s all.
That´s all.
- l´m not lying. He was dead.
- l´m leaving. l want out.
Do we have to do this again?
- You haven´t got a clue, do you?
- What do you mean?
He was already dead.
Do you think that it´s a coincidence
that you´ve met a nice girl?
Astrid?
Don´t you think that it´s strange that
you meet a girl all of a sudden?
Hasn´t she asked about the shop?
That´s how it works, Bjarne.
You´re a success,
and l´m a success.
That´s why Anita wants you.
Because we´re a success.
- Her name is Astrid.
- Exactly.
Could you carve him up?
- Let´s set up over here.
- Okay.
- Anything else?
- No. What time will that air?
At four in the morning.
One dollar.
Turn offthe ventilator.
- Go ahead.
- Wait a minute.
What?
- His pulse is stable.
- That can´t be true.
- Hi.
- Hi.
l´m sorry l´m late.
l´ve been out all night.
- Sure. l´ve taken care ofthe shop.
- l´ve been out all night.
- Do you know who called me?
- Someone who found your brain?
- Beate did.
- Beate?
Yes. You know,
the one you met at the barbecue.
She saw me on TV.
We went to that new club.
We got in forfree, because
they had also seen me on TV.
Tonight we´re going bowling.
Bowling?
You´re going bowling?
- Would you like to see a new car?
- Have you bought a new car?
Yes, let me tell you ...
lt´s almost entirely green.
- What´s that?
- Asmall Swede from the park.
Svend, l can´t do this anymore.
You know the power lines
behind the sawmill, right?
Everybody knows
that they are dangerous ...
Bjarne, what´s happening?
Make him leave.
- Make him disappear now!
- Take it easy.
Hello.
l could like to talk to Bjarne.
ls he here?
No comment.
Anything else?
No!
ls Bjarne coming?
- Please don´t yell at me.
- l can´t help it.
Brain damage.
But Eigil should still be treated
like everybody else in this house.
- ls Bjarne coming?
- No. You shouldn´t be here.
- Please leave.
- Don´t you understand Danish?
l´m not going into this with you now.
Leave.
- But l´m the little Eigil sweetie.
- You may be, but not in here.
- Yes!
- No.
- Yes!
- No.
Yes!
Let me tell you something.
Don´t threaten me with that giraffe.
Please point it somewhere else,
so that we may discuss this calmly.
Would you ... lf you see Bjarne,
then say hello from me.
Give him this.
lt´s a small chipmunk.
From Eigil.
There´s a dog.
CLOSED
Bjarne?
Bjarne, don´t worry.
He has left.
l don´t understand
how that can happen.
lt´s a miracle.
l didn´t believe it myself.
Give him a shot or something.
We had a deal.
You saved him. On the ventilator
he neverwould have woken up.
Then lock him up or keep him here.
ls it because you´ve taken out
a loan against his inheritance?
No, the shop is doing fine.
Eigil is a retard.
- Yes, no doubt, but he misses you.
- No.
His head is just messed up.
l think you´re projecting.
Maybe you have some issues.
Have you tried eating
a drumstick in front ofhim?
l know that he´s a vegetarian.
He told the kitchen.
- He´s obsessed with animals.
- And you became a butcher.
- Can´t you see the problem?
- No.
- l think you have to forgive Eigil.
- Shut the fuck up.
What happened in the accident?
Keep him away from me.
Lock him up. l don´t give a fuck.
You need help and if you won´t let
us help, l have to speak to Svend.
- How do you know Svend?
- From TV.
He´s the only sane person
that you´ll listen to.
Then go down to the shop
and have a chat with him.
Just keep Eigil away from me.
We need more pate.
Everything is selling like crazy.
- The chickens have gone bad.
- Throw them out.
Chop-chop, we have ...
Wow, her hands are big.
l haven´t begun on her yet.
What did she say?
What do you say in a situation
like that? She cried.
- She yelled ´´let me out´´.
- l meant before that.
Some nonsense about you and your
brother and you needing a shrink.
l don´t want to talk about it.
- Four chickies.
- No, chicky-wickies.
- Chicky-wickies.
- That´s right.
Yes, you.
Out.
We don´t want anymore.
We´re trying to run a business.
Give it to Bjarne.
lt´s for Bjarne. lt´s a little dog.
lf you don´t understand me,
then let´s do it like this. Goodbye.
l know that you are
there behind the bricks.
lt´s me Eigil, Bjarne.
Eigil the little funster is here.
No!
No, no, no ...
- Do you often come here?
- Yes, sometimes.
You should come to the church
tower and see shooting stars.
- Along with the weird priest?
- Yes.
ls it true that he was in a plane
crash and had to eat his own wife?
Yes. They were on their honeymoon.
They crashed into a mountain.
Everybody died but him. He was
almost frozen when they found him.
He survived
because he ate her.
- Why didn´t he eat someone else?
- l have no idea.
- Do you live with him?
- l have my own room.
When my parents died
he was really sweet.
He helped with all the arrangements
and had them sent home.
- How did they die?
- Like yours.
ln Germany between
Karlsruhe and Stuttgart.
- Don´t you want to run away?
- Run away?
No, why do you want to do that?
l don´t want to do this anymore.
Alot has happened
since we opened the shop.
- ls it me?
- No, you´re the only good thing.
- What is it then?
- Everything. Svend has gone crazy.
And my ...
No, it doesn´t matter.
lt´s boring to talk about.
lf you don´t run away,
l would like to help you.
No matterwhat it is.
Hi, Astrid. You know Holger
from Rotary, don´t you?
- Yes. l´m going to bed.
- Where have you been?
Out with Bjarne.
Goodnight.
- My Bjarne?
- Yes, l think they´re dating.
l must say
that they are doing fucking great.
- But there´s something wrong.
- What do you mean?
Those idiots forget
to unzip before taking a piss.
And now they´re a big success.
People are standing in line.
l don´t understand it either.
With all due respect for your
otherwise excellent dinner-
- l didn´t care for your chicken.
- Why not?
- lt had a peculiar aftertaste.
The others loved it.
lf only l hadn´t held that dinner,
nobody would´ve heard about them.
- What didn´t you like?
- lt´s probably just me.
But it made me think of Grethe.
l actually thought
it tasted like Grethe.
Like Grethe?
Fly away up to God
and ask forfairweather.
Hi.
- What are you doing?
- l´m playing hide and seek.
- You have to find little Eigil.
- Come on. l won´t hurt you.
All right.
l´m coming.
What are they doing here?
lt´s a chicken family.
They have been murdered by knife.
- Why did you do that?
- No reason.
- That´s weird.
- What´s your name?
Eigil Per Amager,
but l only use Eigil.
- You´re Bjarne´s brother.
- Yes.
Yes, l am.
- There, there.
- You can´t bury animals here.
- l can.
- No.
- Yes, Eigil can do everything.
- Have you seen Bjarne?
No.
No, l said.
He´s hiding in his shop.
Look at the chicken. lt´s dead.
Would you like to see
some live chickens?
l have seen that plenty oftimes -
- but l may be persuaded
ifthey are big.
It´s a giraffe.
It´s my giraffe.
This is my dog Skip.
This is Skip.
- It bit Bjarne aII the time.
- It bit him?
He kicked it sometimes.
He´s allergic to dogs.
But they let me,
because l love dogs.
- Are dogs yourfavorite animal?
- No, all animals are.
- This is Eigil.
- What´s this one called?
lt´s Eigil.
Do you know what this one is called?
- Eigil?
- Yes, exactly.
- Are we going out to the chickens?
- No, enough with the chickens.
Bjarne, wait.
- Bjarne!
- Stay away from me.
- lt´s Eigil, Bjarne.
- Yes, it´s Eigil, Bjarne.
- We are looking at the chickens.
- Stay away from me.
Stay away from me.
Stay away from me.
What are you doing?
Why did you do that?
- Leave me alone.
- What´s wrong?
You can´t kick him like that.
Why are you being an asshole?
You don´t know what
you´re talking about.
Tina ...
- What are you doing here?
- l just wanted to say hello.
How are you?
l´m just fine.
- l saw you on TV.
- Comes with the territory.
- Have you read my interviews?
- No.
- l talked to the local paper.
- l haven´t read that.
l say some excellent things.
At least, that´s what people tell me.
- Why haven´t you seen that?
- l just haven´t seen that.
l get to see movies forfree.
And l can also go bowling.
- But you don´t know how to bowl.
- Yes, l do.
- l´ve seen it. You can´t.
- l beg to differ. People say l´m good.
Don´t you rememberwhen
you slipped in your own sweat?
We had to go to the ER
on the way home.
Don´t you remember?
House Hans Petersen
was a reaItor.
He was probabIy fed up.
Our chiIdren can be annoying.
He often taIked about starting over.
So ... now he´s Ieft.
We foIIow his traiI to ThaiIand
where he was Iast seen.
Yes, I saw him yesterday.
220 Danes
disappear every year.
We try to figure out why.
Watch ´´Missing Danes´´ tonight.
lt´s Sausage Holger.
You have to excuse my late call.
You deliver meat to
Svend and Bjarne, right?
They are my boys, so l would
like to know how much they sell.
How many chickens?
How much poultry a week?
Bjarne, l´m afraid
l´ve done something stupid.
l don´t care.
Listen to me.
l think l´ve crossed the line this time.
l don´t care.
Give me the knife
and open the shop.
Yes, you´re right.
l´m probably
just being hyper sensitive.
The bird is flying.
- Astrid, would you come in here?
- Sure.
- No, can´t he stay outside?
- Okay.
lf you can catch the black one,
you´re the greatest.
You should listen to Holger.
lt´s about Bjarne.
You should sit down.
Well, Astrid, the problem is
that Svend and Bjarne ...
We are fairly certain that
they are killing all my customers.
- What are you talking about?
- They butcherthem like cattle.
And they sell the meat in their shop.
- lt´s true.
- They haven´t killed anyone.
l´m saying this for your own sake.
You should get out while you can.
- Thank you.
- They have only bought 8 chickens.
Why does their meat
taste like Grethe?
l don´t know,
but they haven´t done anything.
Astrid,
haven´t you noticed -
- that Eigil isn´t the kind of guy you
ask for help with the crosswords?
Those boys have problems. Eigil
came out 7 minutes laterthan Bjarne.
His brain didn´t get any oxygen.
Those minutes are the problem.
- How do you mean?
- The parents ruined everything.
They let Eigil decide everything.
Just until one day in June
when it went too far.
- You know about the accident, yes?
- No.
Agiraffe was born
in Stockholm Zoo-
- and Eigil wanted to see it.
The family made a trip out ofit.
Eigil wanted to drive,
and they let him.
Even though Bjarne objected.
Eigil is eagerto get there,
so he drives fast. Very fast.
Bjarne begged him to slow down.
He had his new wife with him.
But Eigil wanted to go to Stockholm
and get a gander at the giraffe.
- Excuse the expression.
- Quite all right, Holger.
They get to the coast,
and then everything goes wrong.
lronically, it´s a deer
that jumps out in front ofthe car-
- and Eigil swerves to avoid it.
lt´s a blood bath.
Ahalal butchering
of Olympic dimensions.
The parents and the wife die
and Eigil ends up in a coma.
Bjarne breaks an arm and a leg -
- but the deer gets away scot-free -
- because Eigil chose to swerve.
Afterwards Bjarne snaps.
He roams around
at night killing animals -
- until the police
hands him overto me -
- and l, by the grace of God,
take him in.
Bjarne is sick.
Stay away from him.
But it´s not until you put him together
with that insane Svend Sweat -
- that it goes wrong.
- l know that they´ve done this.
- You´ve gone mad.
Stay away from him.
Hi, Astrid.
Look at me.
l´m playing with the little birds.
l´m flying.
Eigil, let me show you
what happens to chickens.
- l´m going home.
- Okay.
Are you going out tonight?
No, l have a stomachache.
- l don´t want to see any people.
- Then don´t go into the meat locker.
How about you?
Are you going overto Astrid?
- No.
- We can talk about it if you want.
No.
Bjarne ...
Please stay and talk.
Svend, l can´t do it anymore.
See you.
Hi.
ls Bjarne here?
No. You shouldn´t be here.
He shouldn´t be here.
You have to leave.
lt´s dangerous to be here.
Eigil will behave.
We have killed chickens for Bjarne.
No, you have to respect me.
You have to leave now.
You don´t understand.
You can´t be here with me.
l don´t feel well.
l don´t want to talk about it.
Go away.
He´ll be good.
- He´ll be good.
- We just want to talk to Bjarne.
Do you know where he is?
- Why can´t you just leave?
- We want to talk to him.
He´s out in the meat locker.
Come on.
l forgot that there are two of you.
- Yes. ls Astrid around?
- Come on inside.
- They´re pretty.
- Do you like plants?
Sure. Mine usually die. How do
you get them to grow like that?
Light and warmth.
Abright and warm room creates life.
You have to praise them
and tell them that they´re pretty.
All these plants have helped me -
- to fill out the void after Grethe.
You know what it´s like.
l couldn´t let her go for a long time.
- Where is Astrid?
- Grethe seemed to be in me.
- She was in a way.
- How do you mean?
Didn´t you eat her?
Yes, l did.
- l´m glad l did to this day.
- ls Astrid coming soon?
She probably is.
The good thing about Astrid
is that she lives in this life.
You should do the same.
Or at least try to.
You can´t turn a turtle
into a racehorse.
But you can
turn it into a fast turtle.
Okay.
How long will Astrid be?
She actually went to your shop.
- Weren´t you tired?
- Has Astrid been here?
No. Why?
lt´s just that ...
What, Bjarne?
l´m sorry.
l thought ...
lt doesn´t matter.
See you tomorrow.
You said
you didn´t want to see her.
What the fuck are you doing?
Are you crazy? Stay away from me.
- lt was just a joke.
- Ajoke?
lt´s not funny to lock people up.
Psychos!
- l ...
- Don´t!
Stay away from me.
You´re all crazy. You and you
and your crazy brother. Fuck you!
- Please don´t leave.
- Stay away from me. Don´t!
Well, that´s up to her.
Take it easy.
Bjarne, l´m leaving.
l´m leaving.
l didn´t know that she ...
Can l hold your hand?
No.
Just a little bit?
No.
Brother Bjarne ...
Don´t you even have two for me?
There are no more chicky-wickies
until Svend comes back.
We were looking forward to it.
Maybe l can do something,
but the meat will be different.
- What kind of meat?
- Chicken.
Some other chicken.
As long as
the marinade is the same.
Sure.
lt´s Svend´s marinade.
l have to ask you all to leave.
The shop is closed.
We´re from the FDA.
Thank you.
l´ll take overfrom here.
l have to ask you all to leave. The
shop is closed. We´re from the FDA.
Okay, chicky-wickies for everybody.
What´s happening?
You´re through.
Where is the sweating swine?
l don´t know.
What do you want?
Leif Larsen from FDA.
We´ve received a report -
- that you sell unauthorised meat.
Where´s the queue?
Why is there no queue?
The FDAis here.
- Svend, wait.
- What´s going on?
You found a new victim, didn´t you?
You´re out to get me.
You may succeed.
l may be guilty.
Done is done.
So just take the meat.
Take my meat and run out
if you have any use for it. Do you?
This is Bjarne. l would like
to stress that he is not involved.
l´m guilty.
lf you can talk about guilt.
But l would like to ask if any of you
can look me in the eye and say-
- that l don´t
deserve my success?
- Wait ...
- No, you can´t.
You all want to make something
that people will love.
l may have ...
Don´t mind them.
They do that sometimes.
Bjarne, that really hurt.
This is just chicken in marinade.
- That can´t be.
- l can´t find anything.
There are some joint butts,
but you find that everywhere.
Oh ...
Then we checked the place.
That´s surely always a good thing.
lfthere´s no more meat,
what did you sell?
Chicken.
Then it´s over, Bjarne.
People don´t want that.
- Then it´s over.
- l don´t think so.
Yes, l think so-
- and that´s good.
- l tasted your marinade.
- Yes ...
lt´s good.
lt´s the best l´ve evertasted.
lt´s good. l don´t think
the meat is all that good.
l think the marinade did it.
Are you saying
that my marinade is good?
Yes, your marinade is good.
Everybody thinks so.
One wasn´t allowed on the bus
under any circumstances.
- They were afraid ofthe pig.
- We´ll work it out, Eigil.
- Come on.
- What an outrage.
That´s what they said on the bus.
Throw the ball, Eigil.
- No, Svend will take it.
- No, l won´t, idiot. l have my own.
Yes.
You have to throw them in order
to play. Then throw yours, Svend.
- l´ll throw it, when he does.
- You´re kidding?
- My ball is biggerthan yours.
- l beg to differ.
- lt is.
- l´m not discussing this.
Mine is bigger.
l can even blow it up more.
Can l sit here for a while?
- Sure.
- Astrid!
lsn´t my ball biggerthan his?
- Yes, yours is much bigger, Eigil.
- Stop that nonsense.
Come on down and measure them,
or l´ll go home, let me tell you!
My ball is the biggest.
Everybody loves Eigil.
- Shut up.
- Svend sweats, but Eigil is sweet.
l would rather sweat
than be you, four-eyes.
We don´t say
four-eyes!
- Retard four-eyes.
- Everybody prefers Eigil.
Really? Should we ask people
ifthey prefer you or me?
- No, because you don´t dare.
- Yes!
