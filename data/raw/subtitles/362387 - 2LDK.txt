I'm home.
Home sweet home.
My first Tokyo winter.
Dear Mom...
This is a strange town.
Every place is heated
so that you perspire, even in winter.
Hi Lulu.
God bless Mr. Ezaki.
I heard on the news last night
that having a roof overhead,
3 meals a day and clothing
puts you in the top 40%
by world living standards.
Thanks to other people's money
I'm living like a princess
in a luxury 2-bedroom condo.
But here in this glitzy city
I don't feel like the top 40%.
The climb to the top is steep,
the drop below too deadly.
In this town, winning is everything.
Mother?
You think I'll make it?
Beautrium,
Muteki Records,
Deuces,
Zuppa Inglese...
Zepp,
Printemps Ginza,
Sabatini,
Neal's Yard,
Donkey, Kihachi China...
Nozomi, mach auf!
Nozomi!
I didn't hear you.
Sorry. Hold on.
I kind of dozed off.
I guess so.
Some audition, huh?
Gucci,
$450.
Miu Miu shoes: $300.
You went shopping.
I also went by the agency
to report in.
This house...
We live so close to it.
It's like we're being watched.
The boss kept a girlfriend here.
I see.
He's a slimeball.
I spoke to him about the audition.
He says the director called.
It's down to you and me.
Oh my God.
It's me.
- It's me for sure.
Chanel sunglasses, about $400.
I love it after an audition.
It's so exciting.
Hermes Clipper: $1,850.
Purchased on sale for $1,000.
Let's be cool about this, OK?
Wanna celebrate?
Cartier love ring.
$2,000 a pair.
I don't drink.
Really?
Square.
Do you think the boss' mistress
was a foreigner?
She was from Peru.
Peru?
She left that bird as a reminder
of their relationship.
Said it was a God incarnate.
We'd better take good care of it then.
I'm an actress not a pet sitter.
Today's audition took too long.
Wasn't that AD an idiot?
An old fart trying to be hip.
I didn't think I'd get this far.
I know. The heavy lead
in your first audition.
Heavy lead?
Yeah, in "Yakuza Wives."
You don't see many movies, do you?
I guess I prefer the theater.
Back in high school,
I saw the "Tokyo Theater Troupe".
It made me want to come here.
Who're they?
At the university, I saw
Come Come, Asa Spiders...
Whatever.
I wouldn't waste my time
on that garbage.
Why not?
They're two-bit actors
supported by pathetic groupies.
Lousy.
You haven't seen much small theater.
I've seen enough.
Sitting on the floor, all cramped up,
listening to some guy
making "inside" jokes...
Like, give me a break.
- Humor is a personal thing.
I'd like to kill this bitch.
They couldn't make the big leagues.
Top actors
work a lot harder.
If you want to run with the best,
you better see more movies.
Gotcha.
Too harsh?
But you have to be ambitious
in the movie business.
Can you even spell "ambitious"?
Oops.
I'm getting excited, aren't I?
I could care less if you are.
Look. Munchies.
Great.
Fatfarm, here we come.
I'll chip in some cash later.
Sure thing.
Why not now, cheapskate?
N

L.
Want me to put that away for you?
Real anal.
You can use some if you like.
Really?
Thank you.
What a fulfilling day.

The part is mine!
The part is mine!
SADO ISLAND
The lead role in my film debut.
Hey Nozomi, guess what?
At the audition, the film director
asked me for my phone number.
Bet he didn't ask for yours?
You sure had everybody in stitches
when you mispronounced
the title of the movie.
Air head.
Well, you've got to be different
to survive in this business.
You went to a top college, right?
Mind if I eat?
- No.
Don'tsing.
Damn.
You know, my room gets more sunlight,
and has a better view.
You really don't mind?
Not at all.
I'm allergic to straw.
Milk moustache.
- What?
Sorry.
Okay then.
What's with that accent?
What's with the junior high sweats?
Thatshirt's way too tight
forthose huge boobs.
Ta-daa!
"Hi, I'm Miki from Sado Island!"
Put that away.
Why? It's a good picture.
You should be proud.
I'm trying to be an actress,
not a pinup girl.
Who's a pinup girl?
I totally understand.
Here she goes again.
My debut was in film, right?
Yawn.
I was just
this clueless high school girl.
And here I was being asked to
practically do a nude scene.
In a forgotten movie.
I was trying to act but the directors
just wanted to test my limits.
After that, all I got was T-and-A work.
I've never seen any.
I kept refusing,
against the wishes of my manager.
"Who are you to choose?" he said.
I told him, "Look,
I'll work my tail off as a film actress.
You just get me the work."
I may have taken the roundabout route,
but I guess it's helped me get to
where I am today.
Which is where exactly?
Oh, sorry. I'm rambling
No, no, it's educational.
Where're you from again?
Sado Island.
For the millionth time.
Like, where's that?
You have a boyfriend?
I bet you've got lots of them.
I go on dates sometimes.
I keep a safe distance.
An occasional dinner
is about all I want.
I'm more an actress than a woman.
I'm a "Yakuza Wife."
You haven't gotten the role yet.
But you're young enough
to have some fun.
Hardly.
I figured as much.
Really?
The boss told me
not to date other actors.
I am the top rookie, you know.
- What a fake.
What about inside the agency?
Lots of single guys there.
You must be joking.
Mr. Ezaki?
Bingo!
You don't know Ezaki? Takuya Ezaki!
Yeah, Mr. Ezaki quit last month.
Oh, it's "Mr.", is it?
I hear he left to study film writing.
You guys went to
the same university, right?
I think so.
He'd be perfect.
Can't hold his liquor, though.
How do you know that?
Were you pretty close?
You and Mr. Ezaki?
Not really,
but I was the only one there
who could discuss movies at his level.
Well, no one interests me.
Takuya's great.
Let's call him! He ought to be free.
I have no interest in men right now.
Chill out, girl.
I've got to study.
For "Yakuza Wives."
I think I'll take a bath.
Shut up.
Asshole.
Asshole!
Lana and Ezaki both suck.
Please leave a message.
Hi.
If you love me,
you'll call me right away.
The person you have called
is temporarily unavailable.
Useless.
This number is out of service.
Pay your bill.
Hello? Hi.
I'm entering the subway, sorry.
Lame.
TAKUYA EZAKI
Hello?
Not bad, Ezaki.
Why don't guys like me?
I can't even get Ezaki's attention.
What do they see in girls like Lana?
What?
You used my "Lush", didn't you?
Excuse me?
- My shampoo!
Shampoo?
I know it's trivial,
but I think rules should be kept.
I hate to sound like a bitch,
but we agreed
not to leave hair in the bath.
That's one rule broken.
Plus, using stuff without asking,
that rule is pretty much universal.
Geez, what's this?
I tease her a little,
and she goes ballistic.
That look!
This girl's a clean freak.
She's gotta be nuts.
Are you listening to me?
Your cell phone rang.
TAKUYA EZAKI
"New Message"
Hi, it's Takuya.
About Saturday... something's come up.
Do you think we can make it
another time? I'm real sorry.
I'll call again later.
From mom?
I'll be gorgeous, you'll see.
BATH IN USE
Still?
TAKUYA EZAKI
It's Takuya again.
Did you call?
"Message
has been erased.
There are no further messages."
I'm sorry, Nozomi.
I just wanted to try that shampoo.
It looked so organic.
I should've asked you first.
Forgive and forget?
Okay.
I'll replace it for you.
That's OK. I don't know
what came over me. I'm sorry.
Did you get a call from Takuya?
Sorry for being nosy,
but I heard you were meeting him.
Did he say that?
Email.
Want to see?
"Hey Laney"?
HOW'RE YOU? IT WAS GOOD TO SEE YOU!
Takuya's great, isn't he?
He's got such serene eyes.
Why don't you go out with him, then?
He's available.
I'm comfortable as friends
who share a common passion for film.
That's all there is to it.
Take that.
Hi, it's Nozomi returning your call.
Jerk.
Hello?
Hello, Nozomi?
Mom.
Are you coming home
for your sister's wedding next month?
I told you. I can't take time off
in this line of work.
What work?
I haven't seen you on TV at all.
You've got more education
than the average person!
so why do you
throw it all away
by chasing a silly dream?
That rice cake shop owner
is back in town.
He's been asking about you.
What do you think?
I didn't go to college to tend shop.
You prefer being alone?
You're a broken record, Mom!
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
NOZOMI MATSUMOTO, OUR RISING STAR!
Have you ever seen
such a darling girl?
And she can sing and dance.
She looks like an actress.
I bet a scout comes to see her.
From Tokyo?
- Yes, Tokyo!
Tokyo!
It's not me.
It's not me.
I liked studying for tests.
You controlled your destiny.
Bed time.
What is it now?
You drank my collagen drink!
What?
It was in the fridge.
A green bottle.
No I didn't! You've
labeled everything! How could I?
You like taking people's things.
Cut it out.
You'd do anything to get a role.
On talent, yeah.
The boss told me
to learn shrewdness from you.
I bet you offered the director
your number.
You're paranoid.
I just want to set things straight.
Now apologize.
Screw you!
I didn't drink it, but I'll
buy you one if it makes you happy.
Learn how to tighten a lid.
This'll taste lame now.
What's up?
You're one to talk,
labeling people thieves.
What're you saying?
What's up?
I know you've been dying
to try my Chanel. Why not admit it?
Well, I didn't.
We gotta live together so
let's clear the air now.
Just live by the rules.
Why don't you? I apologized.
Now you do the same.
The lid was loose.
- Sure it was.
Your attitude bugs me
even more than your false accusations.
My attitude? What about your attitude?
Fine.
I'll buy you a replacement,
even though I feel totally ripped off.
I'm not finished.
If you've something to say,
come out and say it.
Ouch!
You're just pissed off
because you think I'll get the part.
That's just sad, Nozomi.
I'm too upset to discuss this calmly.
We'll talk tomorrow.
I need my sleep. I want to be
well-rested fortomorrow.
I wanna be awake
when the call comes tomorrow.
Now if you please.
Did you refill the tub?
You promised, you know.
Dry winter air can be nasty.
He had an affair with a porn star.
I think her name was Lana.
Nice men are easily seduced
by bad women.
N
Stop it!
It's not me.
It's not me!
It's not me!
I'm sorry.
I want to apologize.
I'm sorry.
I'm a murderer.
What?
Aguy I was seeing...
You killed him?
'Course not.
His wife slit both her own
and her child's wrists in the bath.
I didn't know...
he had a family.
Stupid, huh?
Yourface.
My face?
You look
exhausted.
Your face tightens under stress.
Especially the eyes.
Pressure points.
Shichikuku.
Doshiryo.
That hurts.
Because you're tense.
Aging begins with the eyes.
Chiso and...
Shojo.
You're using too much oil.
Your problem is you're too trusting.
Find another man to buy you stuff.
A padded bra?
That bitch.
Hey!
I slept with him, you know.
Takuya.
It's not nice to tease a guy
in the height of his virility.
I hear you're still a virgin.
What a joke.
That's why your acting sucks.
Go back to Hicksville, girl!
I'm allergic to straw.
What's your problem?
Sado Island is a nice place.
My allergy!
Stop it!
I said, stop it!
Time to die!
Shit!
Here, you slut!
Ouch!
Ouch!
Stay!
Weak guard, girl!
TAKUYA EZAKI
Hello, Nozomi?
Thank God.
I'm in Okayama.
My grandmother's pretty sick.
Are you mad at me?
You are.
Look, I'm nuts about you.
There, I said it.
Nozomi? Are you there?
Hello?
I'm utterly infatuated with you.
I am.
I love you, okay?
How many times do I gotta say it?
I've never dumped a guy before.
Feels good.
You think...
I'll make it as an actress now?
You're a Tin Woodman! A Scarecrow!
A Lion!
A Wizard of Oz!
But I'm Dorothy. I'm the heroine!
I am the heroine!
Burn,
scarecrow.
All right.
We'll die together.
Coward!
I'm killing again.
Fry!
Again!
And again!
It's always the bath.
Damn Melatonin.
So what was your film debut?
What?
Even the boss doesn't know.
Can I get it on DVD?
"Convict Sasori '92".
1992?
It was that long ago?
Bug off.
What role?
A tortured prisoner.
Did you have a lot of lines?
Eek! No!
Don't!
That's it.
Sounds great.
Not even a name. Just "Prisoner C."
Were you naked?
And beaten silly.
It's not funny.
If I don't get this role, I'm finished.
It's my last chance.
I can't let it end like this.
I'm afraid of what I'll become
if it is.
Then take the role.
I'll back off.
I don't find it
the least bit interesting.
I can't do that.
I've got my pride.
You're really
a sad little creature, aren't you?
I'm your future.
On second thought, I want the part.
Disappear, girl.
Are you...
going to kill me?
What'll Mom on Sappy Island say?
That's "Sado Island."
Even if you get rid of me,
you can't go in front of a camera
with that face.
Nozomi?
I'm a professional.
I can take everything.
All I need's a good night's rest
and I'll be back to normal.
Bye-bye virgin girl.
Kiss me.
What, are you nuts?
I've never been kissed.
Be my first kiss.
I've longed for it.
I thought coming to Tokyo would do it.
Please. Kiss me.
Kiss me.
You're very beautiful.
See?
You're so gullible.
That's why you have guy problems.
Not bad fora virgin.
Thanks to you.
We could team up.
Professionally?
We don't stand a chance on our own.
We complement each other.
Standup
comedy?
You gotta be kidding.
I'd rather die.
You'd suck anyway.
I'm a film actress,
got it?
That feels nice.
We'll regret this.
What a relief.
Good luck.
You too.
"There's nobody home right now.
Please leave a message."
Sorry to call so late!
It's Aso from the production company.
Thanks again for the audition!
I've got incredible news.
It's about the film role.
You're not going to believe this!
You both got it! You there?
I said you both got it!
Isn't that amazing?
The director's rewriting the script.
He wants to see
the both of you
tomorrow morning pronto.
