NETFLIX PRESENTS
Good afternoon.
This is a special program
with live updates
relating to the development
of this now global pandemic, coronavirus.
The president is expected
to appear in a few minutes,
after meeting with
an extraordinary Council of Ministers
about the coronavirus crisis.
Good afternoon, dear citizens.
Today, I have just informed
the head of state
of tomorrow's
extraordinary Council of Ministers
to declare a state of emergency
throughout our country, Spain,
that will last for the next 15 days.
What's wrong?
Are you okay?
DAY 1 OF LOCKDOWN
What is her name?
We don't know. She hasn't said a word yet.
- What about fingerprints?
- We're working on it.
How's your mom?
They won't let me see her.
Your boyfriend?
Had to isolate.
Lieutenant, we have
the results of the fingerprints.
Her name is Saioa Blanco.
She had been missing
for nearly three months.
She has ligature marks
on her feet and hands.
Considering the state
of her eyes and body,
she must have been
locked up this whole time.
Will she recover?
We'll have to see
what the neurologist says
and we'll have to find
a post-traumatic stress specialist.
We're done.
I'll wait downstairs.
Can I go in for a minute?
Just one minute.
Lieutenant Samuel García,
local headquarters.
Sergeant Ramos, Officer Altuna.
They found Saioa.
You should wear masks.
This virus is serious.
Excuse me. Yes?
How is the girl?
Still in shock,
so we will have to start
the investigation blindly.
Our orders are to make sure
that people don't breach the lockdown,
but if you need anything,
here is my card.
Thank you.
911 received a call.
A driver spotted her
near the San Vicente intersection.
That's on the way to Picu Siana.
It's unbelievable.
We all thought she was dead.
Except for her mom.
She always remained hopeful.
We should call her, right?
We'll do it.
The case is ours and so are the problems.
I didn't say anything.
Besides, we are delivering
some good news.
She'll freak out when she sees her.
Her daughter is alive.
She won't care about anything else.
Who is it?
Lieutenant García and Sergeant Castro,
National Police.
We need to talk to you.
Julia López?
Did... did you find her?
We found your daughter.
She is alive.
How is she? Is she okay?
She had been kidnapped.
She'll need time to recover,
but she is alive
and that is all that matters.
Okay?
Yes.
Your mask, please.
With this state of emergency issue,
I'll need all available staff.
So you'll have to deal
with this case on your own.
Damn, it's like the end of the world.
Maybe it is.
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.
Carlos?
- Hello.
- Hello.
- How are you?
- I have a mild fever and a cough.
- Shit.
- Don't worry. I'm fine.
How about you?
Well...
We have a case.
RETIREMENT HOME
Mom.
Time for bed.
DAY 2 OF LOCKDOWN
She disappeared on December 20th.
She left her home on her bike
early in the morning.
They found her bike in a ditch,
but no trace of her.
They investigated her close circle,
criminals in the area, but to no avail.
We'll have to start from scratch.
Look, that's the San Vicente intersection.
Don't worry, it's not raining today.
And spring is just four days away.
So? Here it rains
as much in spring as it does in winter.
Let's head up.
Police!
Stop, police!
Stop!
Freeze!
Hey, easy.
Get down! On your knees!
It's for personal use.
There is no work here, boss.
We have to get by.
Fucking hippies.
Hello?
- Saioa just woke up.
- Let's go.
They're here.
Hi, I'm Paz Nogueira,
from the Center for Post-Traumatic Stress.
- Lieutenant García.
- Sergeant Castro.
How is the girl doing?
She's weak, but she's recognized her mom
and the connection with her was instant.
- When will she be able to speak?
- It could be a matter of hours or months.
Okay.
Anything she says or draws
would help us a lot.
The last thing we should do now
is force her to remember.
I know it's delicate,
but her kidnapper could get away.
Or he could kidnap another girl.
We have to make her feel safe
or else she won't talk.
How long do you think it will take?
I don't know, but her mom and I
will do everything we can to help you.
Thank you so much.
- What about the girl's father?
- He died in a mine.
- Her stepfather was the main suspect.
- How come?
They got divorced
shortly before the girl disappeared.
Let's pay him a visit.
Do whatever the hell you want.
Ricardo Marquina?
Shit, so the thing about Saioa is true!
She's appeared, right?
Come on,
it's so obvious that you are cops.
How is she?
She's fine, she's alive.
Holy shit, man,
I can't believe it. How is Julia?
Taking it in.
So what do you want?
I've already been investigated.
Your colleagues were here many times
and they searched everything.
We've heard that you and Saioa
did not get along well.
Here we go again.
I was her stepfather
and she was a teenager,
and we didn't get along too well,
or more like I hated her guts,
but never in my fucking life...
let me make it very clear,
I never laid a hand on her
in my fucking life.
Okay?
So, if you don't have a warrant or
anything else, I have many things to do.
Here.
Good morning.
What's wrong?
The guys in the squad
are making bets on you.
Seriously?
And how are the stakes?
Most think that
you will mess up before Easter.
- That's in less than a month.
- Things are getting exciting, then.
How did you bet?
You said it was over
and I take your word for it.
Look at this. Last week, a Korean woman
doing the St. James' Way pilgrimage
reported him
for trying to force her into his SUV.
Manuel Gómez, known as "Dog Killer."
Look where he lives.
Next to the San Vicente intersection.
Yes.
Jesus Christ!
Here we are. This is it.
Fuck!
Quiet!
Go to your kennel!
To your kennel.
There's nobody here.
- Let's go inside and take a look.
- Are you sure?
There's a bed in there.
What are you doing in my house?
Fuck! Get out of here!
- Police!
- Put the shotgun down!
Put the shotgun down!
Why are you in my house?
Calm down. We are looking for a suspect.
We think he might be hiding in here.
In my stables?
Yes. Do you mind
if we go in and take a look?
It'll just be a moment.
Give me the shotgun.
There's nobody.
- What about the bed and the food?
- Oh, that.
It's my cousin's.
He stays here when we go hunting.
That bastard is always so messy.
- I suppose you have a gun permit.
- Of course.
What do you do?
- Who? Me?
- Yes.
I used to check the water meters
of the houses in the county,
but they took disciplinary action
and now I'm unemployed.
Last week you were
reported for assaulting a girl.
- What's this about?
- Tell us what happened.
I didn't do anything.
Fuck, it was a misunderstanding.
I was having some drinks in Oviedo.
On my way home, I saw her and I stopped.
I chatted her up and she followed my lead,
so I thought she wanted something else.
I tried to grope her, but she freaked out.
I wasn't going to do anything.
I just wanted to get laid.
We should arrest him for being a pig.
Fucking disgusting.
Yes? Give me a second.
Right, I just got it.
The scientist's report.
No traces of DNA were found.
And the wound on her leg is a dog bite.
What else?
"The grains of sand
under her fingernails are from..."
They have traces of ethanol
and tartaric acid.
What are you doing?
- Wine contains ethanol and tartaric acid.
- So?
Those stables are full of wine vats.
- He's gone.
- Fuck.
Son of a bitch.
Call the station.
There's police everywhere,
he won't get far.
We have a suspect on the run.
He's just escaped
in a red Mitsubishi Montero.
I'll send our location.
Castro!
Castro.
Fuck.
Samuel, please...
Yes?
We're on our way.
- It's okay.
- Call an ambulance now.
Here!
Stop!
What happened?
He tried to skip the checkpoint
and fell down the slope.
- Anyone in there?
- There's nobody there.
He's wounded.
He can't be that far.
Fuck!
Come on, drop the shotgun!
Drop it! Drop the shotgun!
- Drop the gun, damn it!
- Look at me, it's over!
Drop the gun!
This is just the beginning.
Drop it!
This is just the beginning!
No!
Fuck!
DAY 3 OF LOCKDOWN
How are you?
You should see this.
They were in the wine cellar.
And they're different sizes.
He did not act alone.
He mentioned a cousin.
He said they went hunting together.
Find the cousin. We need to find out
if there were more girls.
We must close the case before
the press finds out and makes a scandal.
The press is busy with the virus.
Yes, but in small towns like this,
rumors fly.
One more.
Then to the right, and another one.
If you feel better,
take one every six hours.
- Are there any signs?
- No, but it is the only house there.
Yes, we have something big,
I'll tell you later.
If your fever begins to spike,
I'll take you to the ER.
Okay. Try to get some rest, okay?
We'll talk later.
Me too. So much.
- I can drive you home if you want.
- Don't worry.
- You could use some rest.
- I'll rest when you rest.
Dog Killer's cousin has a farm
a couple kilometers from here.
Good morning.
Good morning.
We're looking for Manuel Gómez's cousin.
Is that you?
He messed up again?
He said that he goes hunting
with you on weekends.
I've never gone hunting.
And if I ever did,
he'd be the last person I'd go with.
- You don't get along well?
- We don't get along. Period.
He goes hunting with Demon.
A crazy guy who gets high on everything.
He spent some years in the Legion.
Do you know where we can find him?
He works with his brother
as a truck driver.
At the Marquina workshop.
He lives right there,
in the back, in an old caravan.
Thank you very much.
Hey!
Be careful, okay? He is a bad apple.
The phone number 672-274-575
belongs to Santiago Marquina.
The last call from Dog Killer's phone
was to Santiago Marquina.
Demon.
Shall we go in?
The door is open.
Shit, run!
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
He was expecting us.
What the hell happened?
Officer, we are in charge
of the investigation.
- Who are you?
- Commissioner Basterra.
Commissioner. We can help you.
We all know each other here.
Thank you, but just make sure
nobody breaches the perimeter.
Yes, Commissioner.
Everyone knows each other
in these small towns.
I don't want the press to know
what's going on until we catch this guy.
So, the less they know, the better.
He served six months in Iraq in 2004.
He was discharged
and underwent psychotherapy.
He has priors for disorderly conduct,
drug possession and assault.
- A real gem.
- You can come in.
Commissioner.
Wait a second.
These two are boys.
This is not what we thought it was.
Go get some rest.
- No.
- No. We have to find that bastard.
Marta, you two haven't slept for 48 hours.
Tomorrow we'll analyze this calmly
and organize the search.
What if those kids are still alive?
Go and rest. I need you with a clear head.
Honey.
It's okay. Everything will be all right.
Can I go with him?
You need to self-isolate. It's protocol.
I'm a cop. I'm on an important case.
- You were in close contact.
- No, he was isolated.
- We were social distancing, damn it.
- I'm sorry, but you must self-isolate.
No class. Fortnite all day.
What about you, Eva?
- Bored.
- She is on her phone all day.
- That's not true.
- You're on Instagram all the time.
- Don't listen to him.
- Dinner's ready!
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.
- I love you.
- I love you too, baby.
- Is it as serious as they say?
- The virus?
So it seems. I think it's best
if they stay with you for now.
Sure, that's fine by me.
Thank you.
How are you doing?
Holding up. When I feel like drinking,
I start cleaning shoes.
That's good.
I miss you all.
Take care.
DAY 4 OF LOCKDOWN
...are now ready to manufacture
on a large scale
face masks approved
by the Health Department.
They expect to have
the certificate by next week and...
I'm sorry.
How is Carlos?
He's been admitted.
He wasn't breathing well.
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.
Carlos is strong.
He'll be out soon, you'll see.
Come in.
We have already identified the other four.
They were kidnapped
from different provinces
so that no one would link the cases.
This girl was the first victim.
She disappeared in León 15 months ago.
Santander, 12 months ago.
Lugo, nine months ago.
Palencia, six months ago.
And Saioa Blanco, who disappeared
in December and is the only local one.
One kidnapping every three months.
The sexual motive is still an option,
but all of this seems ritualistic.
The nightdresses, the crowns, the dolls
and the mark on Saioa's back.
- Do their families know?
- No.
We're keeping all of this
under wraps for 48 more hours.
I wish I could tell them
that we have found their children.
Or, at least, their kidnappers.
So we have 48 hours left.
Commissioner.
Demon's truck has been found.
Wait.
Use them.
Hi, yes, I hear you.
Give me the details.
MISSING
SUSPECT 1 - SUSPECT 2
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- We haven't touched anything.
- Thank you, we'll take care of it.
Be careful.
Son of a bitch.
Shit.
He is a hunter and he knows the area.
He can't be far.
It'll be like looking
for a needle in a haystack.
Let's go see his brother.
Thank you.
- See you later.
- Bye.
What's wrong?
The thing about Saioa and Demon
is all over social media.
You know what?
I'm starting to get sick of the police.
Where can we find your brother?
That's the million-dollar question.
I wish I knew. I've been calling him
all morning and he won't answer.
You have no idea where he could be?
Where he could hide?
That is your job.
I'm his brother, not his guardian angel.
- Hey!
- Come here!
Your brother is suspected
of kidnapping five teenagers!
Tell me what you know
or I'll accuse you of a cover-up.
Will you let me go?
There's a hermitage in the mountains
next to a fountain called Cuervo Fountain.
He used to take his dates there.
That's all I can tell you.
Honey,
tell your partner to calm down.
The hermitage is here.
Here's where they found the truck.
I'm out of bullets.
- I'm out of bullets!
- Hold your fire!
I'm out of bullets!
Here I am, you sons of bitches.
Get down!
Make me.
Get down!
Lie down.
Make me lie down.
- Lie down now!
- No.
What?
- Lie down.
- I don't want to.
Get the fuck down!
Son of a bitch! I'm gonna kill you!
It's over.
No. This is just the beginning.
- Take him away.
- This is just the beginning!
This is just the beginning!
This is just the beginning!
I'm not talking.
So save your energy.
We don't need you to say anything.
We have plenty of evidence.
Fantastic.
You'll be the first one
in this area to get a life sentence.
You entered the hermitage.
Crazy stuff, right?
You're not crazy. Just sick.
No... We are not sick, society is sick,
or haven't you seen
what is going on out there?
The pandemic?
The end of the world.
Okay.
So that is why you kidnapped those kids.
Someone had to do something
to appease Taranis.
The Almighty. The God of Storms.
What have you done with the kids?
Where do you keep them?
I told you we had to appease Taranis.
What happened to Saioa?
Were you going to sacrifice her too?
It was only a few days away,
but Dog Killer broke the rules.
The asshole took her out to get
some fresh air and the girl ran away.
Otherwise, you would have never found us.
- So you were the one making the rules.
- No!
- No?
- Not me.
All this is the work of the Prophet.
Who is the Prophet?
He guides us.
And he is very smart.
You will never catch him.
Listen to me.
Now you have the chance to outsmart him.
Tell me his name and the life sentence
will fall on him, not you.
You caught me. I will carry that cross.
Tell me his name.
Hit me.
Come on. Maybe this way
you'll get me to tell you something.
Come on. Hit me.
Come on.
By the way,
keep your eyes peeled,
the Prophet has not completed
his work yet.
Did you hear that?
It's a bluff.
I don't think he's smart enough for that.
There's only one person who can help us.
- How is she?
- Better.
We have two suspects.
One committed suicide,
the other is in custody.
I would like to show your daughter
some pictures to confirm that it is them.
- It's too soon, she isn't ready.
- I know, but it's very important.
We need to confirm
if there's a third party involved.
I don't know.
We need to stop him
from hurting another girl.
If she sees you, she'll get scared.
Thank you.
Honey.
How are you?
My love...
Was it them?
Sweetheart...
These men have already been caught, okay?
But we want...
It's okay.
How many were there, Saioa?
SAN RAFAEL HOSPITAL
EMERGENCY
How is Carlos?
He was put on a respirator.
They say he should
start to improve in a matter of hours.
I'm sure he will.
Were you able to talk to the girl?
Damn it.
What now?
We need to find him before he acts again.
Taranis was referred to
as the god of storms and tempests.
They had human sacrifices to appease him
during the summer and winter solstices,
or the spring and autumn equinoxes.
Every three months.
The straw dolls, the mistletoe,
the symbols, the ritual sacrifices...
All of that is from Celtic mythology,
from the Druid world.
Druids were priests
with prophetic powers in Celtic Europe.
They performed human sacrifices
and believed in reincarnation.
In short,
we are dealing with a bright spark,
a fucking psychopath who thinks
he needs to do human sacrifices
to appease the gods
before the end of the world.
Spring starts in 48 hours.
We have 48 hours.
This is crazy, girl.
We have two full floors
and this is just the beginning.
By the way, did you hear about this girl?
Yes, a friend from the ICU said
she had been held hostage for months
and the police arrested someone from town.
I know, that's scary.
Yes, I just received them, both of them.
Yes, I have both lists here.
A number keeps coming up
on Dog Killer's and Demon's phones.
Give me the data.
Let me see.
Yes, I can see it.
The number belongs to a prepaid card.
Okay, thank you.
Look at this.
Demon and Dog Killer
were childhood friends.
Damn it.
The number belongs to a Ismael Fernández,
who passed away in 2015.
He's not crazy.
He knows exactly what he's doing.
How can people be so...
We'll catch him.
I'm getting coffee.
- Do you want some?
- No, thanks.
Can I help you?
Hello?
Hey, wait.
Wait, stop.
Stop!
Stop, police!
Turn around. Slowly.
The hood.
Your ID. Give me your ID.
Why were you by the police station?
Didn't you hear the news?
There is a curfew. You can't be out.
SURNAME - VEGA
NAME - LIDIA
Go home.
- Who was that?
- Nobody. A crazy woman.
DAY 5 OF LOCKDOWN
MY MOM HAS PASSED AWAY
- Samuel, I'm sorry.
- Where is she?
Many were sick and they
didn't let us take them to the ER.
Where is she?
We have orders to take them to the morgue.
- I want to see her.
- They won't let us.
Samuel!
Excuse me, you can't be here!
Did you hear me?
Get out of my way.
- Move!
- Okay.
Move!
Yes?
I'm on my way.
Take this to the lab.
I'm so sorry, Samuel.
What do we know?
She is a nurse, a 20-year-old girl.
Someone attacked her and took her away
in her own car, a gray Peugeot 308.
- Are there security cameras?
- Yes.
One at the entrance and one on the corner.
I've asked for the footage.
Do you think it was him?
That zip tie is just like
the ones we found in the truck.
- Let's go.
- Where?
- What happened?
- A girl has been kidnapped.
The commissioner?
He's at the government office
for a pandemic follow-up meeting.
We need the detainee to be present
for a search.
- Have you talked to the judge yet?
- Call him and ask for authorization.
Are you sure?
We can't waste any more time.
Come here.
Come on.
Let's go.
Come the fuck out!
Stay there.
What's wrong? Do you want details?
Who is the Prophet? Tell us his name.
You should've heard their screams.
Like when you shoot a fawn
and it gets badly wounded.
Exactly like that.
Who is the Prophet? Tell us his name.
And the boys were the ones
who screamed the loudest.
Tell us his name
or you won't get out of here alive.
You don't have the balls.
Tell me his name.
Who is the Prophet? Tell me.
Tell me his name.
Who is the Prophet? Tell me his name!
I'll never tell you his name.
Samuel.
Leave if you want.
Who is the Prophet?
If you do it, it will ruin you.
I'll say you tried to escape.
Come on, I'll take the risk.
Come on.
Samuel! What the hell are you doing?
Let go of me!
- What was that?
- Stay out.
Tell me his name.
His name!
You have a pair.
Three, two...
one!
Samuel!
What the hell are you doing?
A life is at stake. I had to try!
You are suspended without pay.
I can't protect you anymore.
We need to try.
We can't just sit back and do nothing.
She already said there were three men.
I'm sure she can tell us something more.
Don't you think my daughter
has suffered enough?
Julia, another girl has been kidnapped.
Look, I'm deeply sorry,
but Saioa needs to forget what's happened,
not recall it.
- Don't you realize...
- Listen, Paz, stop it! I'm done!
- Leave my daughter alone for a second.
- Julia...
URGENT
MISSING
How is he?
We have transferred him
to the ICU preventively.
With the ventilator and the medication,
we hope that he will start improving.
- May I see him?
- Sorry.
- Just so that he knows I'm here.
- I'm sorry, it's protocol.
Please, let me see him.
You can't,
but I'll let him know you're here.
Don't worry, he's in good hands.
We'll keep you informed.
PAZ NOGUEIRA - Can we talk?
Police.
It's all right.
- Ramos.
- Lieutenant.
I need your help.
Do you know this man?
The photo must've been taken
20 or 25 years ago.
Of course I do.
They called him "the Prophet".
Kids loved him.
Do you know where we can find him now?
I haven't heard anything for many years,
but his father lives near Infiesto.
Thank you.
Wait! I know the area very well.
I'll take you there. Come on.
Sergeant...
Sergeant.
What do you want?
Maybe it has nothing to do with it,
but I've seen the cuts on Saioa's back.
A woman under treatment at our center
has the same symbol engraved on her chest.
She was in a cult when she was young.
What is her name?
Lidia Vega.
Shit.
We're almost there.
- Hello, Lidia.
- Hello.
How are you?
That coffee smells great.
Do you want one?
I could really use it.
SAMUEL - I have a suspect
I'm on my way to Infiesto with Ramos
SAMUEL
LOCATION
There's a car here.
It belongs to the girl
that disappeared yesterday.
I was 17.
I had run away from home and lived
with some hippies in an abandoned mine.
We spent all day
smoking pot and having sex.
Until the guru became obsessed
with druids and sacrifices.
What was the guru's name?
They called him "the Prophet".
What happened?
That's him. With his father.
He wanted to perform a ritual on me.
Good thing one of the guys
stopped him in time.
Who was the Prophet? What was his name?
His last name was Ramos.
He was from Infiesto.
Yes?
Samuel, it's him.
Officer Ramos is the Prophet.
Pick up the phone.
Come on, Samuel. Pick up.
Samuel!
- Samuel.
- Officer down!
Samuel.
Sergeant!
Sergeant.
There is a corpse inside.
Looks like it's been dead for years.
- What is that noise?
- It's an alarm.
There is a mine down there.
DAY 6 OF LOCKDOWN
I am the Prophet!
I know man's destiny!
It's okay.
It's okay.
Calm down.
A prophecy is being fulfilled.
It's the end of the world.
No!
Don't move.
Don't move.
Don't move!
This is just the beginning.
It's over. You're all right.
It's okay. It's over.
DAY 10 OF LOCKDOWN
At 2:00 a.m.,
Congress authorized extending
the state of emergency
until April 11th.
No plenary session
had lasted so long in 20 years.
With 321 votes in favor,
none opposing, and 28 abstentions,
Congress has authorized
extending the state of emergency.
Confinement measures have been tightened...
How is the girl?
Better.
Does it hurt?
No. I'm fine.
What about Samuel's family?
You can imagine.
I missed you so much.
Me too.
Fuck.
It's like the end of the world.
Maybe it is.
