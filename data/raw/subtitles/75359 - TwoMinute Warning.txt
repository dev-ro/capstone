Stay!
Charlie.
Mmm.
Come back to bed,
Charlie.
I'm lonely.
I need some lovin'.
Come on, it's Sunday,
for God's sake.
Are you religious?
Championship Sunday.
Come on back
to bed, Charlie.
I can't.
Team meeting
at 7:30.
Then kiss my ass.
I'd love to.
Just not enough time.
Are you
checking out, sir?
I'll get your bill
for you.
Are you okay?
Hmm?
Are you okay?
As a person
or as a quarterback?
As a person, I'm delighted
to make more money
than the President.
As a quarterback,
I don't know.
I may have
the heart of a lion
but these knees belong
to medical science.
Those knees
were okay last night.
In fact, everything
was okay last night.
Here's your change, sir.
Twenty-seven, twenty-eight,
twenty-nine, thirty.
And your receipt.
Thank you for
staying with us
and please come again
the next time
you're in L.A.
Good morning, boys.
Good morning.
Sam, Sam.
It's 8:00 in the morning,
wait for some time.
So give us
a phone number!
Oh, Captain, uh, listen,
Sam's asking for
seven more men
down at the Coliseum.
Look,
I got a 150 men
out there
for 10 blocks
around the Coliseum
now pulling traffic.
If somebody...
Excuse me.
Somebody find me
10 more men for traffic
maybe then he can have
seven for the Coliseum.
 On tension in the Mid-East
 according to sources at
 the State Department.
 At the UN...
 ...and the Council Woman
 believes action by
 property owners
 may provide some
 taxpayer relief.
 At a quarter of the hour
 it's a beautiful sunny day
 here in the Southland.
 Perfect weather
 for this afternoon's
 Championship Ten contest.
 With details on
 the season's big game
 and a roundup of
 other sports news, here's
 Fred Gallagher. Fred?
 Chuck, it'll be
 Baltimore, Los Angeles,
 before a capacity crowd
 90,000 plus at
 the L.A. Coliseum.
 And millions more
 on National Television
 anticipating perhaps
 the most evenly matched
 Championship game in
 the history of the league.
 The pivotal performer
 Baltimore's Blue Cross
 quarterback, Charlie Tyler,
 hoping to nurse his
 bandaged knees through
 just one more game.
 The Lakers host
 divisions leading...
I'm gonna
kill you!
You chickenshit.
You chickenshit

R-20 David

It's a Code Four.
We have the suspect
in custody.
Do you mind
if I ride alongside?
It's a free country.
 And we'll have live updates
 throughout the game.
 And I'll be back
 in 30 minutes with more
 from the world of sports.
 Chuck.
-  Thanks, Fred.
 Checking the weather
 picture for L.A.
 and vicinity,
 slightly warmer with
 light to moderate smog
 in the inland valley areas
 and some evening
 low clouds.
Hello, Bob,
how you doing?
Hey, Charlie, you old horse,
how the hell are you, huh?
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
How you feeling?
I feel great.
Can you use
a ticket?
Yeah, sure, I can use it,
it's a big game today.
I want you there.
I'll be there.
It's a long time
since Boston College.
I was on
the same plane
with you.
I couldn't help
but notice how
attractive you are.
You know, you have
a very beautiful mouth.
Yeah, so do you,
but it's big.
Go away, lady,
or I'll call a cop.
I am a cop.
Well, then, kiss me,
I'm crazy about cops.
Hey, let's get a room.
We came 3,000 miles
to see a ball game.
Let's see
that ball game.
Come on,
let's get a room.
So what's
the morning line?
Baltimore minus
two points.
Where'd the two points
come from since yesterday?
Tyler's knee?
You sure?
Thank you.
They say Tyler's knee
is as good as new.
You gonna
bet Baltimore?
They're full of shit.
Okay, that's enough.
That's enough.
Tyler's knee is mush.
I know.
Trainer's a buddy
of mine.
Hello, Max. Stu.
Stu Fablue.
Listen, I want L.A.
plus two points, right?
Okay, give me Los Angeles,
plus two points
for 30 grand.
That's what
I said, Max.
30 grand.
 Trends expected
 to continue on Wall Street
 this coming week,
 following Friday's
 heavy trading and
 encouraging closing figures.
 Spurred by a hike
 in the prime rate
 and the Commerce Department's
 report of another monthly gain
 in the index of leading...
Hey, are you
sore at me?
Forget it!
You are sore.
Now why in the hell
should I be sore at you?
You came on
with every guy
in the airplane.
If it wasn't the pilot,
it was the guy
across the aisle,
and then some poor
son-of-a-bitch that couldn't
even speak English!
Now, why can't you
just sit there and
pay attention to me?
Oh, hey, you know
I didn't mean anything.
I was just
being friendly.
Hey, taxi!
Get in.
Five, four,
three, two.
Come on, Ben!
Touchdown!
That's enough!
Michael!
You're really testing me,
aren't you?
Testing, testing,
one-two-three, testing.
Oh, very cute!
Nothing to eat
till we get there.
How long
will it be?
Who wants a mint?
KIDS: I do!
You want a mint?
Hey, nobody gets a mint.
All right?
I don't want
any of that stuff.
He loves them.
He may love it,
but I don't want him
to have that stuff.
Now, cut it out!
Just one.
Just one, Michael.
It's just one mint.
Just watch
where you're going!
Would you, please?
They can each
have a mint.
Michael,
stop being depressed.
Come on.
If you wanna
spend your life in
a dentist's chair,
that's beautiful for you,
but don't wish it
on the kids, all right?
I gotta go
to the bathroom, Dad.
So do I.
Come on.
Michael, you're not
gonna get to me.
Let's hear it
for your father.
Mr. Sandman,
there's a call for you.
I'm sorry to disturb you.
That's all right.
It's on 736.
Here, buy yourself
a mountain.
Thank you.
Thank you,
Mr. Sandman.
Hello,
Sandman here.
Oh, hello, Mr. Green,
how are you?
Oh, no trouble at all.
Sure, I'll be right up.
Bye-bye.
Honey, a friend of mine
wants to see me.
I'll be right back.
Listen, why don't you go
into the gift shop,
buy yourself a little goody.
First come here.
Go, Eddie!
Go, baby!
All right!
Please,
don't put this down.
Watch it, bro.
 Fire units
 standing by where
 a construction crew
 accidentally broke
 a natural gas pipe line.
 No evacuation in the area
 is underway,
 but residents
 are being asked to
 shut off pilot lights...
Mr. Green in?
What do you say, Stu?
Mr. Green.
Hey, Manny.
Stu.
Mr. Green, you look great.
What can I do for you?
Well, for starters,
you can pay me the
28 G's you owe me.
Hey, no sweat,
I'll have that for you
Wednesday night, honest.
Well you see, Stu, I'd like
to see that money in my pocket
before you make any new bets.
You understand?
Yeah, but, see,
I can't do that,
Mr. Green.
I'll have it for you
Wednesday night,
honest.
Drinks will be on me,
Wednesday night.
What's the matter?
What you doing?
What you doing?
Oh, don't, no,
Mr. Green, please,
I didn't mean it!
I didn't...
Ah! Mr. Green.
Ah, Jesus Christ.
Oh, God...
Please, please,
Mr. Green!
Don't let me!
Oh, oh...
Please,
please, listen.
I hear you been
spreading a lot of money
around town, Stu.
Money you don't got.
What the hell you wanna do
a thing like that for?
You listen.
I just hope you
picked the right team
today, Stu,
because if I don't
get that 28 G's in my
pocket before sundown,
you're gonna take
another trip out
the window,
and next time
nobody holds
the ankles.
You got it?
I got it!
I got it.
Get out!
Here's a place to park
right up there.
Oh, come on, it's $5.
It's crazy!
Well, you wanna
walk a mile?
Good morning, Ross,
how are you?
Hi, Ginny!
A little coffee,
darling?
The lenses have been
changed. 16:1 is on
five and eight.
10:1 is across from the
other with the elements
that you ordered.
 Only three lives
 were lost in the crash
 of the Czech airliner
 when it put down on a lake
 near the Austrian border.
 This just handed me.
 The California Highway Patrol
 has declared
 a big alert in effect on the
 Northbound Harbor Freeway
 at the Vernon off...
 ...in this afternoon.
 The CHP is suggesting
 motorists in the area take
 surface streets where possible
 for at least
 the next 45 minutes.
 That location again,
 the Harbor...
Oh, John,
would you watch it?
Sorry, Mom.
Jesus!
Want a potato chip?
No, thanks.
Hey, you better get those
kids in to lunch, huh?
John.
It's gettin' late.
Robert.
Come on.
Come on in.
You hungry?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Me, too.
Okay.
No, Robert,
this isn't for you,
it's for everybody.
Here.
Oh, John, this is
a good one for you.
Is she cute?
Huh?
Not bad.
Great.
 And the Council
 okayed the six and a half
 percent pay hike
 brings to a close
 the tense situation
 which at one point
 had negotiators almost
 at an impasse
 over contract agreement.
 In other labor news,
 a settlement is being ironed
 out by Federal mediators
 on the government
 conciliations
 tentatively on a three year
 contract involving 5,500...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Are you going to the game?
Yeah. What seat
are you in?
Me, too.
I don't know.
Really?
Have a good day.
Okay.
Hey, wait up,
will you, guys?
Come on, lover,
get your act together.
Will you guys
wait for me?
Come on,
give me a break,
will you?
Coliseum, please!
Well, should be
a good day.
Oh, I hope so.
Uh, Parker, John, Larry, let's
see you zoom it all the way
in on your lens, baby.
Twelve, 35, 15.
All right, everything's
looking good.
We're less than
10 minutes before air.
I don't have a picture
from the blimp yet.
Hey, can you,
can you see?
I don't know how.
When you gonna
get this guy a haircut?
He looks like
a hippie.
How can you see?
I don't understand it.
I can see.
So can you.
Everybody can see.
Now, don't be wise,
all right?
Keep moving,
folks, step right through.
Any gate.
Come on,
have your tickets ready.
Souvenir programs.
Get your programs here.
Come on, I need a picture
from the rubber rocket.
Gotta have it.
Hook me up
to the Goodyear Blimp.
Uh, Ted, check with the, uh,
microwave on the Tower.
Let me see how that looks.
Frank, you and Hal
standby...
Just coming in?
All right,
put it on the line.
Gary, Pan across...
Pan right across
the city there
and onto
the stadium, Gary.
Atta boy,
that looks good.
Now, Frank,
you and Howard stand by,
we'll be with you in a minute.
We're just checking out
some lenses, babe.
Ron, keep five.
On, two, three, four,
five, six,
seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven, twelve,
thirteen, fourteen...
Come on, kids.
Right through here.
That's it. Tickets, please.
Tickets, please.
Tickets. That's it.
Come on, lady,
keep moving.
Keep moving, lady.
Come on,
tickets, please.
Tickets.
Souvenirs.
Hats, pennants!
I want a pennant.
Can I have a pennant?
Oh, Michael,
come and get them
a pennant.
How much are
the pennants?
BARKER: Two bucks.
Gimme two of them.
Daddy,
can I have a hat?
How about a hat?
Come on.
I want a hat.
I want a hat!
No hats.
Daddy, can we
get a hat?
No hats. I said.
All right?
I don't need a hat.
Come on, here you go.
I don't want a hat,
buddy. Okay?
Why don't you
try the hat.
No, I don't...
I don't want a hat,
all right?
You got
the tickets?
Mister, my dad
lost his job and he
doesn't have any money.
Oh, baby,
come here.
How much
are the hats?
$5 each.
Well, give me
four of them.
Get your hats
and pennants right here.
Robbery, buddy.
Thank you.
Hey, you all right?
Right this way.
Souvenirs.
Hats, pompoms!
Come on folks,
step right up.
Step right up.
 Today's game is a sellout.
 Please sit in your
 assigned seats.
 Show your ticket stub
 to the ushers.
Governor, is it true that
you and Governor Diller
are going to
sit together
during the game?
Well, I should hope so.
Governor and Mrs. Diller
are here today
in honor of Mrs. Ogden,
myself, and
the State of California.
Which I consider
mighty hospitable.
Especially since
Baltimore's gonna win.
Do you mind, ladies?
Do you mind, ladies?
You can pull
in your knees
a little.
Sam, 20 men?
That two full squads.
I know you got a big crowd
on your hands, but how am I
supposed to come up...
Hey, come on, now.
I got the Governor here.
I've got two Governors.
I got seven Senators,
two astronauts.
I've even got
an Arab Oil Prince.
Got nothing to do today
but watch the football game.
Let's hope that the Israeli
Consul General just stays home
and watches television.
Now, the President
might be here
at half-time.
I thought that was off?
Well, they might
put it on again.
Everybody wants
his picture in the paper.
All right, I'll have to see
what I can do
with the other division.
I'll, uh, call Metro,
maybe they can
spare somebody.
Come in on line three,
will you, baby?
All right,
give me a time check.
Uh, you got it,
three minutes to air.
I got video.
Okay, now take 'em,
now's the time.
Come on,
come on, this way.
Watch it, huh?
Let's go, let's go,
this way.
Right this way.
Get one for your...
Baltimore, souvenirs,
hats, pompoms.
Excuse me.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Okay, Howard, standby,
you're listening
to Stan's count.
Five, four, three...
Standby to fade up.
...two, one.
We're on.
Now hit the matte
and fade up.
Go, Howard.
 Live from
 Los Angeles
 Memorial Coliseum,
 it's Championship Ten
 Los Angeles against
 Baltimore.
 Hello again, everyone,
 I'm Howard Cosell,
 along with Frank Gifford.
 We don't have to
 build this one up for you.
 The title game
 for all the marbles.
 There's more than
 91,000 people
 jammed into the stadium,
 watching most closely,
 of course, the opposition
 quarterbacks.
 Here's Giff to tell you
 about them.
 Charlie Tyler,
 uh, Howard,
 we watched him
 for many years.
 He's in his 13th season.
 The question about
 Charlie Tyler, will those
 two bad knees hold up?
Matte is out.
Standby for the next,
uh, Lloyd Braum okay.
It's out.
Standby for his shot.
As it comes up
lay a matte
in there for me.
 His counterpart,
 a youngster, Lloyd Braum,
 of San Diego State.
 He's only 24 years old
 but he's had an incredible
 second half of the season.
 Coming off the bench to become
 the first black ever to lead
 a team to the Champ...
 ...in this game.
 Fans and both teams are
 statistically very close.
 A field goal could be
 the deciding factor.
 And don't forget,
 in Championship play
 in case of a tie,
 we go into
 sudden death
 overtime.
 To the right of your screen,
 forty-five years of age,
 out of Wisconsin.
 Never made it big
 as a player,
 but as a coach,
 he's led...
Hi.
Hi.
 And number 16, Charlie Tyler
 and head coach Dan Edwards.
Take two.
Mike Robbins
is starting today.
Mike Robbins?
Yeah.
Who's Mike Robbins?
Quarterbacker,
I think.
Flankerback.
I hear Charlie Tyler's
knees are really bad.
Yeah, they could
go out any time.
Well, Baltimore
has to win, we came
all this way.
They'll win.
Did you bet
on the game?
We've been living together
for five years
and you ask me
if I bet on the game?
Of course,
I bet on the game.
 Ladies and gentlemen our
 National Anthem will be sung
 by the well known
 television personality
 Merv Griffin.
 ¶ Oh, say, can you see
 ¶ By the dawn's
 early light
 ¶ What so proudly we hailed
 ¶ At the twilight's
 last gleaming
 ¶ Whose broad stripes
 and bright stars
 ¶ Through the perilous fight
 ¶ Or the ramparts we watch
Hi, honey.
Hi, honey.
Hungry?
Yeah, medium,
okay?
Okay.
Give me that!
Mommy, he took the ball.
Mom, is my
hamburger ready?
Not yet, honey.
 ¶ Gave proof through the night
 ¶ That our flag
 was still there
 ¶ Oh, say does that
 star spangled banner
 ¶ Yet wave...
 ¶ O'er the land of the free
 ¶ And the home
 ¶ Of the brave ¶
He got
a standing ovation.
I think we've
had enough of
this bourgeois.
Let's go!
Let's go!
 The referee for today's
 game will be John Sheldon.
 One different
 from the other,
 but each
 most successful
 at his trade.
 And Jim Gibson will
 end the long wait...
 ...taken at the
 10-yard line there by Johnny
 Sanchez. He's out of the 20...
 One might have suspected
 that 61 Zuckman
 would be leading
 the charges.
 He's a superb player
 on this special team
 and a force of...
 Baltimore's ball.
 Second down and two
 on their own 36 yard line.
Okay, you got
the play all the way, Bob.
Three-19.
The left flank, hut!
 Gilmore has the ball,
 it'll be a touchdown.
All the way, baby!
I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!
You guys don't learn
and you asked for it!
You asked for it!
Gilmore. On for
 the conversion Jeff Brewer.
 Holding is Charlie Tyler.
 It's good.
 And Baltimore has
 a seven to nothing lead.
Oh, shit!
What's the score?
Baltimore,
seven to nothing.
Hell of a run.
Excuse me, ladies.
Oh.
Sorry.
Excuse me, ladies.
WOMAN: Ow!
I'm sorry.
Father?
Hmm?
You're sitting
on my jacket.
Oh. I'm sorry.
I don't believe
a man can't feel it.
I don't believe it.
What's the score?
I'm losing.
I mean,
Los Angeles is losing!
Baltimore seven,
nothing.
What you
looking at me
like that for?
Are you all right?
Father, I got a bundle
riding on Los Angeles.
Right now,
they look like shit.
Excuse me, Father.
Hey, you wanna
do me a favor?
Put in a prayer
for Los Angeles.
Actually, I'm for
both sides.
Aw, you guys are
always for both sides.
Do me a favor,
will you?
Put in
a little extra for L.A.
I need it.
I really could use it,
honest to God.
I sure could
use it.
Here's, uh, the rundown on
that shooting up on Sunset
this morning, Captain.
Oh, good game.
Looks bad
for L.A., though.
Yeah.
That was a sniper,
working out of
the 12th floor
of a hotel
just off the freeway.
A single shot
from a high-powered rifle
right through the heart.
"Married, two kids."
Who the hell would wanna
kill an assistant
professor of botany?
Who knows?
Some nut, I guess.
 Jeff Brewer
 kicks off for Baltimore.
 And taking it is...
Oh, shit, come on.
 He fumbles the ball,
 picks it up, moves up
 looking for that gap...
Or, some nut,
looking for target
practice probably.
About the only thing
we know is that
he was white.
That's a big help.
White, black,
that doesn't take
you any place.
The thing with
these freaks is
you got no M.O.
Nothing!
Well, at least it didn't
happen in our division.
 Los Angeles ball on the
 27 yard line first and...
Hut!
It's my first game.
My name is Al.
You know,
somebody's about
to get hurt.
If they send that guy
over tackle again
they'll nail him.
 L.A., second down,
 two yards to go
 from their own 35.
 That's the end
 of the first quarter
 with the score
 Baltimore seven,
 Los Angeles, nothing.
Great seats, huh?
Jeffrey always goes
first class.
Way to go, Jeff.
Are you a doctor?
Yeah,
how'd you know?
Dirty shoes and
clean white hands.
Lot of guys have
clean hands.
But not that clean.
It must have taken you
10 years at least
to get 'em that clean.
What are you doing,
a commercial or what?
Morning.
 Los Angeles' ball on
 their own 35, 2nd down...
What happened
to our defense?
Maybe it's
back in Baltimore.
Sit down.
Oh, well,
what's happened to
our secondary?
Dave White should never
have caught that pass!
Bet you five bucks
L.A. comes back
with another pass.
No, way, Ed,
you're wrong.
Save your money, Ed,
L.A. is gonna fumble.
 Baltimore's ball first
 and 10 at midfield.
I can't stand this.
They're falling apart.
I gotta get a beer.
You want a beer?
I'd love one.
Would you
bring me one?
Yeah, make it
two, John.
It's Jeff.
Right, Jeff.
Thanks, Jeffrey.
Thanks.
What happened?
L.A. fumbled,
Baltimore recovered.
Mmm.
Jeffrey's very orderly.
He can't stand fumbles.
My roommate
set him up
for this game,
and he wouldn't dare
be seen
beside an empty seat.
Well, so he leaves you
beside one, huh?
Oh, not exactly.
Two-eighteen. Hut!
Come on, let's go!
Hey, look at that!
Would you
like a drink,
honey?
Oh, well, absolutely.
It's very kind of you.
Thank you.
Cheers.
Cheers.
All right, seven,
go in a little tighter.
Parker, tighten it down
a little bit on him.
Stay with 16, Tyler.
16 in the white,
gentlemen.
Stay with Tyler,
the quarterback,
he's down.
Dad, let me see
the glasses.
No, let me just
see the glasses.
Come on!
Hurry, come on,
let me see 'em.
 Number seven, Vince Strohm,
 replaces Charlie Tyler
 as quarterback
 for Baltimore.
Three.
Fifteen, hut.
Hut!
Brandy Cal,
 he has the ball,
 he's inside
 the 10 out of bounds
 at the five yard line.
 Taken out of bounds
 by Jerry Aker and Baltimore.
Now that was a play!
Now the plane
arrives at 2:20.
It'll come right from
the airport to here.
That should be
about a quarter to 3:00.
And he'll be
at Gate 14.
Block that kick.
Block that kick.
Block that kick.
Block that kick.
Block that kick.
 The clock is stopped with
 41 seconds left in the half.
Look at him go!
Take six. Look at him!
 And look
 at George Vandeveer.
 Known for a violent temper,
 he's manifesting it in front
 of the players!
Now, how about that?
 Baltimore now
 14 to nothing.
I can't believe
the way Los Angeles
is playing.
I don't believe
you guys!
 Jeff Brewer kicking off
 for Baltimore.
You're doing
a hell of a job,
too, Father.
Do me a favor,
will you?
Stop praying.
 And Jeff Brewer,
 number 19, will kick off
 for Baltimore.
 He's down to the 25.
 He's still going,
 he's at the 30.
 He's going all the way.
 He might go all the way.
It looks like he's
going all the way,
Ronnie.
Okay, big boy,
he's got it.
Vandeveer,
you asshole!
Don't go for
a field goal when
you're 14 points behind!
What are you
looking at?
Turn around.
What happened?
L.A. at the 29,
first down,
only seconds left.
Hell, they should
go for it.
14 to 3 is better
than 14 to nothing.
He's gotta get some
points on the board.
Aw, come on, will you?
 And that's the end
 of the first half.
 With the score
 Baltimore, 14,
 Los Angeles, 3.
I hate football!
Well, I don't like it
much myself.
You don't?
Then why'd you come?
To meet you.
It was destiny.
Come on,
I'm serious.
Take out some of those
monitors back there.
We're going away.
Okay, Gary,
give me a cup of coffee
and a hot roll, okay?
Come up on chroma key.
And matte. Go, Howard.
 And so the halftime score,
 Baltimore, 14,
 Los Angeles, 3.
To tell you the truth,
I prefer chess.
Chess?
Are you any good?
Am I any good?
I was a prodigy.
No!
Yeah. When I was a kid.
Seven years old.
I played 20 adults
simultaneously.
No! How'd you do?
I lost every game.
What the hell,
I was only seven.
Hey, Ben Casey,
it's halftime.
The players have
left the field.
Why don't you
hang onto your
stethoscope
and watch the
band for a while?
Come on, we gotta
get out of here.
Excuse me,
I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?
Oh, it's okay,
I enjoyed it.
Thank you, sir.
Hey, let me have one.
That's all that's
left is one.
 ¶ Oh, it's beer, beer
 ¶ Beer, beer
 ¶ Beer, beer
 ¶ That makes you wanna
 cheer on the farm ¶
Mom, you're
ruining my appetite!
Oh!
Oh, excuse me!
Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Thank you very much.
Hey! Hey, what
the hell do you think
you're doing, huh?
Oh, I'm sorry.
He tried to
pick my pocket.
He's got a crowd shot.
Go ahead and go to Parker.
Go take seven.
Seven's up on the line.
 But he is not
 Charlie Tyler.
 He's heir apparent
 to the Baltimore
 quarterback job,
 but this is not
 the place to...
 Oh, what'd
 you stop for, Frank?
 She's a fixture
 in the vicinity.
 Here for every
 Los Angeles home game.
All right.
Parker, get her
phone number.
Let's get off of her.
Look, Dad.
Huh?
Look it, a blimp.
Where?
Up there.
I bring you to
a football game
and you're looking
up in the sky?
Okay, Larry,
stay wide in there.
Baltimore's option,
gentlemen,
they're gonna kick
off right to left.
They're gonna defend
the right goal
kicking to the left.
Dean, go in tight
on the receiver's
end, baby.
Okay, come up
on the blimp
and matte.
 From
 the Goodyear Blimp
 high over
 the Los Angeles
 Memorial Coliseum.
 A good look at the over
 90,000 fans here stand
 their way into the Coliseum
 for football's
 annual classic,
 Championship-10.
 The second half
 is underway,
 and receiving
 is Los Angeles.
 Back there to
 kick the ball
 is George Ryan.
Okay, take seven.
Seven's got the kick.
Okay. Jesus Christ,
find out about that
blimp, will you,
for Christ's sake?
All right, we've got
an injury on the field.
Take nine.
Okay, babe, it looks good.
The blimp is breaking up.
Six to seven.
Seven to one.
Hey, what goes here?
What the hell's the matter?
Come on, we need it!
Just a minute.
Did you get
a hold of him?
Well, tell the schmuck
to stay awake.
All right, start
pushing circuits.
Second and 20.
All right,
just hold it down.
Goddamn it,
the whole room, quiet!
Maynard, tell 'em
to pan that camera down
and lock it off.
Right where
it's at now.
Just lock it off there
and let 'em work on it.
 We're trying, Ron.
We won't have it
for a while. Let's go.
Okay, we're
on camera 10.
Hey, uh, set it down.
Gary?
Isolate camera two.
Can you get
a little closer
for me, babe?
Isn't that the little roof
above the scoreboard?
Next to Y.
Hang in there, guys.
It's a scratch cut.
Oh, my God.
Jesus Christ.
Pan off it, Gary,
pan off it quick.
Don't go back to that shot
unless I tell you,
you understand?
Just stay off it! Move!
What's that?
Repeat. Repeat.
Hey, what's going on?
I don't know.
They want us
in the TV truck.
 Los Angeles
 first down on Baltimore's
 47-yard line.
You wanna see me?
No, Ted did. Ted!
Ted,
you wanna see me?
Yeah,
there's something
I wanna show you.
Uh, we spotted this
a few minutes ago.
And I thought
maybe you should
take a look at it.
I mean,
maybe it's nothing,
but...
All right, can you
see up there?
Hey, there's
a guy up there.
Where?
Up there. See?
I see.
Do you keep a man
up there, Mr. McKeever,
for security or something?
No, no, nobody's
allowed up there.
He's got
a rifle with him.
Where?
You see,
right in front of him.
You see it?
Andy, could we
get a better shot
of the blimp?
Uh, blimp. Hold
that shot up there,
will you please, Gary?
Ron, take Gary
to blimp number 11
and put it down
to the pre-set monitor
will you, babe?
- See it?
- Oh, yeah.
Jesus.
 But now they are
 starting to move.
 They are starting to show
 that great gallant game
 that got 'em here
 in the first place.
 The ball goes
 to Dave White.
 Big hole up the middle
 and White all the way
 down to the 11-yard line.
 You're right about
 Brown's leadership.
 He's really got that
 ground game working.
 And a word
 about Dave White.
 Brilliant, unsung blocker
 who paves the way
 for Stallmaster.
 Yet he's gained 900 yards
 on his own this year.
 A good power driving
 back out of Miami of Ohio,
 the famed breeding
 ground of coaches.
Listen, could he
be Secret Service?
No, no, no.
Now, listen, you tell that
guy of yours in the blimp
to keep his mouth shut
because if anyone
hears about this,
all kinds of hell
could break loose.
Uh, Ron, will you
cover the show
for just a minute?
Everybody back
on video control.
You can use this
private sign right
down the middle.
We'll have to be very cool,
but make sure the doors
are locked
and nobody gets in here.
Don't let anybody...
There you go!
Now they're back at it!
Yeah, Holly.
 Pete, Sam McKeever.
We spotted a guy
with a gun above
the scoreboards.
Is he shooting?
 No, but get him
 before he starts.
The President's
on his way
from the airport.
 All right, I'll meet you
 at the players' entrance.
I'll take care of aborting
the President's motorcade.
Uh, I'll want a list
of all the VIP's
at the game.
Gallagher, get in here!
Larrabee, that's a Roger.
Sir, I'm afraid
we're going to have
to abort our arrival.
Well, wait a minute.
The score's 14 to 10.
I'm sorry, sir,
but our security's
been compromised
out at the Coliseum.
Aw, shit!
 First and 10
 for Los Angeles
 at the Baltimore 46.
Hey, Pete.
You can't see him.
He's up there.
Yeah, I wonder
how many others
there are.
Why?
How do you get up there?
Well, you see
that ladder up there
on the south side?
You have to go
across the arches
to get to it.
What's underneath?
There's a room
behind the scoreboard.
Anybody in there?
No, it's all remote control
from the press box up there.
Can't you get it
through the ceiling?
No, there's no hatch
up there and the ceiling
is 18-inch cement.
Christ! He really
picked it, didn't he?
Yeah.
What are we gonna do?
I wanna have
a look at him.
Wait a minute.
You think there's some
other guys with him?
How the hell do I know?
 He went to
 shift directions and
 he weaves as he walks.
Excuse me, sir.
Can I help you?
Inspector Holly.
Just go about
your business.
Looking good, baby.
Looking good.
Listen, will you give me
a shot of that guy
on the roof there,
in that one over there.
All right.
Ron give us...
You wanna bring it down
to the pre-set monitor.
Uh, that's a modified
Remington 742.
It's got a scope.
Yeah, I can
see that, Sam.
That rifle comes with
a four-shot clip.
You see that magazine?
It's gotta hold
20, 30 rounds.
Hey, guys,
will you get out of
the way, please?
You know, this
is a Championship
Football Game.
This isn't a goddamn
fire drill.
Look, friend,
this is police
business.
Don't push me
or you'll be
damned sorry.
Is that clear?
 ...Charlie Tyler,
 and you have to admire him.
 He's come back into
 this football game...
All right,
take four, will you?
Okay, now matte.
We gotta find somebody
who knows the layout
on these cables.
Uh, Paul?
Wait a minute,
I wanna talk with you.
Hey, you in the grey suit.
Yeah, yeah, you.
Get away from there.
Police business.
We gotta patch a monitor
into your blimp line.
You can't screw
around with that
during a game.
The hell I can't, pal.
Did you see anybody
up on that peristyle roof
this morning?
No, sir.
What's going on here?
"No, sir"?
Did you know
there's a man up there
right now with a gun?
What? How the hell
did he get up there?
That's what
I'm asking you.
Aw, now you said...
I didn't see nobody.
The flags were
up before 10:00,
the door was locked
and the dogs are up there!
Dogs, what dogs?
The watch dogs.
Yeah, we let 'em out
at night then we pen 'em
up there during the day.
So he could've
been up there
all night?
That's right.
Aw, no way,
he could've gotten in
through that door.
That door's
my responsibility!
I always lock it after
the flags are down!
Is that right?
You're sure, huh?
Oh, look here,
Mr. McKeever.
You're not gonna
hang this on me.
I've been Chief of
Maintenance too long for
that kind of bullshit!
I know damn well
that door was locked!
That is bullshit.
Now let me tell
you something,
if I find out that
he slipped through
your gates,
you're gonna have
a hell of lot of trouble
coming your way.
And if he's up there
because of you...
Will you take it easy?
Nobody's gonna
blame anybody.
Don't tell me
to take it easy,
will you?
The hell he ain't!
Will you calm down?
Goddammit, hey!
Hold it!
You locked the door
when you finished
with the flags?
Damn right!
I always do!
I told you,
Mr. McKeever!
Go!
Come on.
You know,
if the President
doesn't show,
maybe he won't
do anything.
Well, I'm not gonna hang
around to find out.
Sam, you're as bad
as the guy in the truck.
We, uh, we're
going to the roof.
Hey, hey...
Hey, hey!
What are you
doing here?
Same as everybody else.
Watching the ball game.
Great!
Have a good day.
What have
you got in mind?
Evacuating the Coliseum.
Oh, come on,
you can't be serious?
Pete, you're looking at
close to 100,000 people.
What do you think?
It's my responsibility
to see that none of them
gets killed.
That ought to
be yours, too.
My God, you can't even
see him from here.
This is nothing
personal, Pete,
but you don't have
the authority
to clear this place.
Bullshit.
I'm gonna have to call in
SWAT to get him
out of there.
Imagine if that
bastard opens up
in this crowd
with an automatic weapon?
 Loss of one yard
 on the play!
Oh, my God.
That's Paul.
Son of a bitch.
 Captain Holly,
 there's a man
 climbing the ladder.
I know, I see him.
Calloway, anybody else
in the truck see that?
 No, sir.
 Just Ted here and
 the guy in the blimp.
Where is he now?
 Back down
 where he was before.
Well, keep on him.
Thank you.
Skool.
He's a hell of a charmer,
just make sure his hair
doesn't fall in your drink.
Better call SWAT.
Well, let me get a doctor
to see about Paul.
 Los Angeles ball in mid-field.
 Second down one yard to go.
Come on, Pete. Pete,
let me get a doctor up
there for God's sake.
I am not gonna do anything
to stir that clown up.
I don't know how the hell
I'm gonna get SWAT to come
in here with a low profile.
I thought you were
Captain of this division.
Rank doesn't
cut any ice with SWAT.
They got their own
chain of command.
Commander 3
to Three L-90,
all other units
stay off Tac-2.
I want the responding
SWAT units
at the Swim Area off Menlo.
Enter Gate-14.
I want three ambulances
fully staffed.
Tell 'em to kill the siren
two blocks from the Coliseum.
 There it is.
 That's the end of the third
 quarter, with Los Angeles...
Hello? Hello?
Chris.
Chris, it's the desk.
Hello, Button.
Yeah.
Yeah. Okay.
Right. Right.
Will you be home
for dinner?
Be careful.
What the hell's he doing
just sitting up there?
Hey, Sam, did you call
the Mayor's office?
No, he's watching
the game.
He is in there?
Right.
Well, why the hell isn't
he on the list?
I don't know. Somebody
goofed, they didn't
get his seat number.
 The pass is
 complete to Johnson
 at the 32 yard line.
Who's in command
of this team?
Sergeant Button.
He's in that green car
right there, sir.
Button.
I'm Captain Holly,
Southwest Division.
Yes, I know.
We got a male Caucasian
on top of the scoreboard
in there
with a semi-automatic rifle.
Got a felony on him?
That's why
you're down here.
Two-seventeen.
He butt-stroked a maintenance
man off a 60 foot ladder.
I want to get this
cleaned up before
he starts shooting.
You ready to turn
this over to us?
No, I'm not, Sergeant.
I'll let you know.
You just get your men
cranked up and standby.
All right?
Beck?
Where the hell's
that truck?
It rolled out the station
10 minutes ago,
it should be here
any second now.
You'll notice we have a few
crowd considerations,
like about
100,000 of them.
That's why I'd just as soon
you didn't let your people
run around
in there with those M-16s,
like a bunch
of storm troopers, okay?
That's not exactly what
I had in mind, Captain.
I mean,
the situation is
a little fuzzed up,
but I would like to put
a couple of men
overlooking the suspect
in the Coliseum,
on those light towers
up there.
Sounds good.
Go with it.
Ah, Sergeant Button,
uh, Sam McKeever.
Coliseum manager.
Can I borrow this map?
We have a male Caucasian
on the Coliseum Tower
over the central arch.
He's armed with
a semi-automatic
high-powered rifle.
He's already butt stroked
a maintenance man
off of a 60 foot ladder.
And he can turn and shoot
into the crowd at any time.
Before we get in any deeper,
I'd like to
protect our own asses
in a high ground position.
Garrison and Rose,
get up there and give
us some cover.
Decker and McCoy,
you're SWAT 1.
You'll be positioned in
the Northeast Light Tower
overlooking
the suspect's location.
Pratt and Sutherland?
Yo.
Yo.
You're SWAT 2.
Your position will be
the Southeast Light Tower
overlooking the
suspect's location.
Remember, men,
we have over 90,000 people
in that Coliseum.
There'll be no firing
without my direct orders.
Because it hasn't
been turned over
to us yet.
That's why
I'm putting you men
in specific positions,
so that when it is
turned over to us
we can go.
Move your asses.
Let's go.
Shake it up!
Oh, Father, great work.
You're praying like a champ.
 The conversion is good.
 Los Angeles 17,
 Baltimore 14.
Hey, this is
a football game,
not a singles bar.
Now why don't you
watch it and shut up!
Oh, Father, listen.
If nothing goes wrong,
you won't believe this,
but you're sitting next
to a very, very rich man.
Honest to God.
He's been sitting up there
the whole game.
He's never fired a shot.
What does that matter?
As long as we get him
before he starts.
Sergeant, it's
the automatic weapon
that worries me.
If you don't waste him
with the first shot,
he could spray the crowd.
Look, Captain,
any one of my men
can take out an eye
at 200 yards.
I don't doubt it.
What do you expect him to do,
stand up and smile for you?
Just let me
worry about that.
That's why you're here.
You get your men
into place
ready to move,
but it's no go
until we get
all the VIPs out.
The VIPs?
They're probable
targets.
Bullshit. Everybody's
a probable target.
Sergeant, move your men.
Make it on
my shit list here.
Give him a hand, let's go.
Come on, keep it moving.
Okay, move
on the double.
Take these men
to Section 28.
I don't you to go that way.
I want you to go that way.
Code-2. Move it.
Okay, on me.
Move, move, move.
This is 166 minutes,
 20 seconds.
Pete, we got
the doctors here now.
Oh, let's not leave
them all bunched up.
Move one of those ambulances
down under the scoreboard.
But keep it
against the wall,
out of sight.
All right,
now what about Paul?
Captain? I'm sending
Angelo and Pikowsky
up to the Press Box
to keep an eye on things.
Weapons out of sight.
You're Scout One, move!
Brooker, Harmel, Gimmel.
Front.
I want you to see if you can
gain access to that room
on the North end
of the peristyle.
You are SWAT 3.
Move.
 First and 10
 on the Baltimore 31.
Do you have any
architectural plans,
designs, blueprints?
Yeah, got all
that stuff in the office.
Homer, Beck, Leiber, front.
I want you to go
with Mr...
McKeever.
McKeever.
See, if you can find
a structural way
to reach the suspect.
Okay.
Right, we're ready.
Don't forget about Paul,
will you?
Come on, boys.
That's the man
got butt-stroked
off the ladder.
He's still lying up there
on the roof.
You got a doctor?
Right over there.
All right, give me a doctor,
we'll put a flak vest
on his ass.
Isn't that a little dangerous,
sending a civilian through
a kill zone?
The whole place
is a kill zone.
 Fourth down,
 eight yards to go
 on Baltimore 29.
What the hell
did you do that for?
You are not paying
any attention to me.
I came 3,000 miles
to see a ballgame.
I'm paying attention
to the ballgame.
I see the ballgame,
but I'm still paying
attention to you.
Do me a favor.
Have your bartender
cut you off, will you?
I've got you covered
back here, Mike.
Scout One to R-20 David.
We're in position.
All right,
let's go, boys!
All right, I'm gonna
get up there and
tie the rope off
and send it down
to you, okay?
Yeah.
You all right?
Huh?
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.
Go ahead.
Okay.
Hey, what are
you guys doing?
Water and power department.
Huh?
Water and Power.
Goodbye.
Second down,
 seven yards to go for
 Los Angeles from their 37.
You all set?
I'll go up, tie it off,
drop a line down.
All right, let's go.
Third down one yard to go
 for Los Angeles on 43.
Garb a hold of
the back of my harness.
What's this?
That's the scoreboard.
How do we get inside?
From here, up the staircase
to the scoreboard room.
Be careful, though,
there're 25,000 volts
up there.
 Time out for measurement.
Go ahead.
 First and 10
 for Los Angeles on
 the Baltimore 44 yard line.
Door.
Safety switches,
you dumb shit.
 Second down
 and two yards to go
 for Los Angeles,
 at the Baltimore 36.
 Los Angeles fumbles.
 Baltimore recovers the ball
 on the 30 yard line.
How high is
that wall, about five,
five and a half feet?
Yeah, that's my guess.
What's inside
that tower thing?
It's just a bare
cement room
with a ladder running up
the inside of the tower.
He's got a goddamn
bunker there.
With that scope
he has his pick
of the bunch.
I figured
the President.
He's not coming now.
You don't have to worry
about that.
How did you
know that?
His press secretary
made an announcement
over the radio.
Goddammit, I told McKeever
to keep that quiet.
That clown's got
a radio up there.
Now he probably knows
the President isn't coming.
Don't try to get logical
about these kooks.
Never know
who he is after.
Half the time
he doesn't know.
We figure he's waiting
till the end of the game.
He'll get away
in all the confusion.
There's no way down
from there,
except that ladder
on the outside.
Maybe he's waiting to see
what happens in the game.
Like, uh,
who wins or who loses.
That's how crazy
these people are.
Hut!
You're sure your men
have got it clear now?
They're to
hold their fire.
Look, Captain, I'll be
a son-of-a-bitch if I send
those men up there
wondering what the hell
it is they're supposed
to be doing.
Button, what is it
with you?
You just can't wait
to crank up
those fancy M-16s?
Look, I didn't put
that man up there.
If there's a chance
to get him down,
it's my responsibility.
I say, take it.
Well, dragging him down
in a garbage bag may be your
idea of a routine operation.
God knows you people
are good at it,
but I'm a peace officer
around here
and it scares me.
Well, let's not get
too nervous about it!
All right,
I'll give you
your shot.
We're coming up
on the two minute
warning.
You ought to have
your people
in place by then.
When the two-minute
whistle blows,
it's your ballgame.
Fine.
We're set to move in
at the two-minute warning.
Did you get the Mayor
out of there?
Haven't found him yet.
Well, what are you
standing around for,
Lieutenant?
What happens if the nut
starts shooting before
the end of the game.
When he starts shooting,
SWAT goes.
SWAT 6
to Commander 3.
Commander 3,
 what's he doing?
The suspect's up.
He's just walking around.
He is not
carrying his rifle
at this time.
R-20 David to SWAT 1.
Are you in position yet?
Where the hell
you been?
Stopped for a beer.
You want one?
Smart ass.
Hurry up and get
your safety line on.
Commander 3
to SWAT 6.
 SWAT 6, go.
What's his position?
 He's got the clip in
 but he is hunched
 over the rifle
 like he's praying
 or something.
Defense! Defense!
Block that kick.
Block that kick.
Block that kick.
Hut!
 The field goal is good.
 The score is tied
 17 to 17.
Come on, shut up, Mister.
Aren't you watching?
Commander 3,
this is Section-10.
We have a man down
in row 41.
Sam, we got a man down
in Section-10, row 41.
 He's lying in the aisle.
Okay, we got it tied up.
One more.
How about
another drink, baby?
No, thanks, baby.
Your missus sure knows
a hell of a lot
about football.
She is not my missus.
Still nervous?
That's right.
We're still gonna wait.
Just don't get itchy.
He could just
be a drunk.
Pete?
McKeever.
 It's a heart attack.
Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor,
I want you and your wife
to get out of here right now.
That means you, too.
Right now, come on.
Jesus Christ Almighty!
I'm sorry, Father.
Something I gotta
tell you.
I'm in deep shit.
Excuse the expression.
You see, I got L.A.
and two points.
Baltimore wins,
there's this guy,
he's gonna kill me.
Sutherland!
Yo.
You get a glimpse
of that turkey yet?
No, I can just
barely make out
the top of his head.
I got a lousy shot here.
Mike, take a look at
the Northwest light tower.
I think I see somebody
moving around over there.
Yeah, it's another asshole
up there, too.
Scout 1 to R-20 David.
 Observe additional suspect
 on the Northwest light tower.
 Description as follows.
 Male, Caucasian,
 30 years,
 long light hair.
 Wearing blue Levis jacket and
 has, what appears to be
 a khaki knapsack at his feet.
Roger. Copied.
Shit, it could
be a professional.
Porter.
What do you
want us to do?
I think we have
it under control.
Porter, give me
15 seconds.
Hey, you. What the hell
are you doing up there?
Hey, relax, man.
Don't worry about it,
just relax, okay?
If you wanna see the game,
get down in a seat,
or I'll call the cops!
Just take it easy.
I ain't bothering nobody.
Come on,
get down from there!
Just relax,
I ain't bothering you
or nobody else.
I'm gonna call the cops
if you don't get down,
I'm warning you!
I don't need that shit!
Take the peanuts and
stick them.
All right,
relax, everybody.
Take it easy.
Calm down.
Watch the ballgame.
It's a good ballgame.
Sit down.
Big tough guy.
Official police business.
Come on, let's move.
Come on, let's go.
Let's go.
All clear.
At the door.
Take it easy.
 Second down
 and seven yards to go.
Who is your friend
up there?
How much
they paying you?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Who's your friend up there?
What's his name?
Where do you come from?
Denver.
He is clean, boss.
SWAT 6 to all SWAT units.
The suspect is up.
Yeah, where's the rifle?
Is he holding the rifle?
 Yes, he's
 holding the rifle.
SWAT 6 to all SWAT units.
We have lost
our blimp picture.
You lost the what?
No, say again.
You broke up.
I repeat, we have
lost our blimp picture.
What the hell's going on?
I thought we had
the problem solved?
Well, we lost it.
Come on,
do something now.
R-20 David
to all SWAT units.
Be advised blimp picture out.
Repeat...
Hey, Doc, there he is.
Can you get him?
Yeah, I got him
in the cross hairs.
R-20 David this is SWAT 1.
We can see him clearly now.
Oh, goddammit, he's down.
R-20 David, SWAT 1.
 He is back down.
 First down Baltimore
 on the 35 yard line.
Susan, Susan,
do something for me.
Tell me if you see something.
There just above
that scoreboard.
Uh-uh.
Nothing out of
the ordinary?
Nope, I don't see anything.
Here. Why?
Nothing! I'm gonna
be back in a second,
all right?
Hey, Michael,
what's the matter?
Nothing.
You want me to
come with you?
No.
Just enjoy the game.
Excuse me.
Have you seen a policeman?
Commander 3 to SWAT 6,
can you see him yet?
 SWAT 6 to Commander 3,
 not yet, Captain.
Heading over
to the roof.
Officer!
Excuse me.
Do you guys keep a man
in the area just above
the scoreboard?
Why do you wanna know?
I, uh, think I saw someone
up there with a rifle.
Come on, let's go!
What's the matter with you?
You haven't said anything
in 10 minutes.
Why do you
take such pleasure
in telling people
we are not married?
I don't take
pleasure in that.
You always make
a point of it though.
Well, I'm not
aware of it!
You're not aware
of anything.
I'm aware of one thing.
If you don't like it,
you can get the hell out.
Aw, come on, Jan.
Janet.
Take your hands off me.
Car salesman!
Yeah, uh, we checked
the microwave dish
down here and it's fine.
You're sure.
Right.
Have you checked
the transmitter up there?
 What the hell for?
Because that's where
we think the problem is.
Well, what's he see?
What's the suspect doing?
I told you I'd get you
a seat for this game.
How do
you like it so far?
I'd like it more if asshole
would stick his head up.
Yeah, asshole's gonna
have his day
pretty well messed up.
Air-3. Orbit higher,
for Christ sake!
Hut! Hut!
I first saw him
through my binoculars
towards the end
of the half.
What exactly
did you see?
I told you,
a man with a rifle.
Looked to be a carbine
or something.
Did you tell anyone?
No.
Why?
What's going on?
What...
What's happening? Tell me.
Well, you know
about the guy already?
Sir, would you kindly
come with us?
What for?
We're conducting
an investigation. We'd like
to ask you some questions.
Yeah, okay, but I want you
to be straight with me and
tell me what's happening here,
because I have
my family with me.
They're in Section-24.
I want to make sure
they're all right.
You're a witness in
an investigation...
I understand that
and I want to cooperate
with you,
but I would like to
make sure that my
family's all right first,
then I'll come back.
We need you as a witness.
That's all we need.
It's just an investigation!
Come on,
get your ass down.
Take it easy, Mister.
Take three, Ron.
Stan, keep me honest
with the commercial...
All right,
just tell me why
are you doing this.
And why are you
doing it now?
Look, I don't give a damn
about this ball game,
I do care about us!
What the hell are you
talking about?
You got us!
No, there's no such
thing as "us"
when somebody
can turn to you and say,
"If you don't like it
you can just get out!"
That's not the first time
you've said that to me,
you know!
All right.
I don't know. I...
Are we together
or aren't we together?
I just don't want to
be in the position that
every time we fight
you can tell me
to get out.
He's still crouched down
near the wall, Captain.
All right,
you son-of-a-bitch
just stay put.
 Time out on the field.
 That is
 the two-minute warning.
That's the two minute.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Five, four,
three, two, one.
We're away.
We're on a commercial.
Commander-3
to R-20 David.
R-20 David, go.
He's all yours, Sergeant.
R-20 David
to SWAT 1 and 2.
 We have a green light.
 I repeat,
 we have a green light.
He's up.
You know I
care about you,
don't you?
More than anything
in the world,
I care about you.
You know that.
I know that.
And I love you.
You know that, too,
don't you?
Well, then,
why are you doing this?
I don't know.
"I don't know."
Do you want to
get married?
Do you want to
get married?
Well, come on,
I can't read your mind.
You want to get married,
open your mouth, say so.
You want to get married?
Come on.
Yes, I really do.
So do I.
Come on, let's go
to Vegas right now.
I hate for you to miss
the end of the game.
Oh, no, what you mean is
that you don't wanna miss
the end of the game.
Well, perhaps...
Do you wanna go to Vegas
or do you wanna watch
the end of the game?
Can't we do both?
Oh, don't start with me,
Janet, geez.
Hey, you know,
you have beautiful
blue eyes.
And you've got a big mouth.
We'll watch the end
of the game, come on.
That's no way to
spend a honeymoon.
We're not married yet.
Block that kick!
Block that kick!
 Baltimore's field goal
 is blocked.
 Los Angeles takes
 over on their
 own 20 yard line.
R-20 David to Air-3.
Take the fly-by
in the Northeast corner.
I don't want his attention
on this side of the roof.
You know the first thing
I'm gonna do
after we're married?
What?
I'm gonna buy you
a used car.
Officer! A man's down.
Help him.
Help him.
Help him.
 Los Angeles ball,
 second down
 and 10 yards to go.
Pete!
Get up here!
Come on!
SWAT 6 to all SWAT units.
We got our blimp picture back.
The suspect's up, armed,
and at the north side
of the parapet.
He's zeroing in on us!
Roy's down. He's been hit.
He's hanging from the line
up here.
I want some men
to cut him down quick.
God in heaven,
you get up here quick!
Get that man in an ambulance.
We can't leave him here.
We sent for
paramedics, sir.
You move him, now!
Yes, sir.
Let's keep these people
out of sight.
You, get down at the end
of the tunnel.
And, Miss,
come on with me now.
Miss? Come on.
Come on.
Here's your coat.
 The ball's being spotted
 on the 36 yard line.
 First down Los Angeles.
Downing, Fuller,
go back to the door
and give us cover.
Porter, Cleever,
we're the entry team.
Defense! Defense!
Defense! Defense!
 Second down
 and 10 yards to go.
 The ball on
 the 36 yard line.
Just show me a piece
and I'll blow
your fucking head off!
Goodbye, asshole.
 ...there for Gary Stone.
 He was encircled.
 Beautiful double coverage
 by Baltimore.
 For the youngster
 who led the league
 for the past two years
 in receptions,
 again coming up short.
 He's having a very
 disappointing day, Howard.
 One of the most
 spectacular stories
 in the league.
 First round draft choice
 three years ago
 out of Washington State.
 As you said,
 led the league in receptions
 the past two years.
 Lloyd Braun
 now looking over
 a second down and 10.
 Directing this fine
 Los Angeles attack.
 They were
 totally ineffective
 in the first half.
 Splitting wide receivers
 left and right,
 the tight end in close.
 Braun back, looking.
I can't believe
that I'm in!
Look at that.
Here we go.
Honest to God,
I don't believe it.
Let's go.
Oh, my God!
Help me, please!
Jeffrey! Jeffrey!
Where you
going, Captain?
Shut up!
What the hell
are you doing here?
Dammed if I know.
How bad are you hit?
I'm all right.
Jeffrey! Jeffrey!
Jeffrey!
Lucy!
Jeffrey! Jeffrey! Jeffrey!
Smoke bomb.
You know how
to use this?
I remember, Sergeant.
We'll wait five seconds
after you throw it.
Then we'll go in on
a criss-cross pattern.
Al! Al!
Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on.
Don't be afraid.
Hold on.
Just put your hand
over here.
Now just rest on me.
Just rest completely
on me.
Come on,
everything's gonna
be all right.
It's gonna be okay.
It's okay, it's okay.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Lucy, Lucy!
All right,
we're ready. Go.
One, two...
Three.
Four.
Five.
All right, pal,
that's all there is.
Drop the rifle
and come down.
Come on,
you bastard, move!
I got a piece here.
Get his dying declaration.
Listen to me.
You're dying.
Now you tell me who
sent you up there!
Where'd you get that gun?
Who were you trying to get?
Come on.
His name's Cook.
Carl Cook.
He's a transient
from out of state.
All right. Cook,
talk to me.
You talk to me,
you miserable
son-of-a-bitch!
Where'd you get that gun?
Who were you trying to kill?
Answer me,
you son-of-a-bitch.
Who were you
trying to kill?
Please.
Don't hurt me.
Any doctors
in the crowd,
please check in
over here.
Susan.
Is she all right?
Yes, just a shoulder wound,
she'll be fine.
Come on,
we gotta put her in.
Where are you
taking her?
USC Medical Center.
His name's Carl Cook.
Who the hell was he?
I don't know anything
more about him, Sam.
You'll be hearing a lot more
about him on television
for the next couple of weeks.
Where he went to school,
his nice mom, his pet dog,
his old gym teacher.
The body count,
and how the cops really
didn't have to kill him.
Had a doctor
look at that yet?
Ah, it's no big deal.
Don't be a hero,
Sergeant.
I'll drop you off
at the hospital.
Come on.
