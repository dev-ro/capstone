Oh, the drums are so mournful
My dear, oh, my love
As my thoughts
They are turning your way
Where are the eyes
I beheld with my own
On that long ago lazy day?
Dead are the leaves
On the stark battlefield
The stench of the flesh sickens me
I slept soaking wet
And the worms ate my bread
And the moaning of men filled the air
Oh, green are the leaves
Of the old apple tree
Those sweet perfumed Blossoms of spring
Entwined in your hair
The smile in your eye
A soft blade of grass for a ring
- François!
- Francesco!
François. François...
- He's ill!
- What's happened to you?
He's come back from the war
because he's ill. He's not a coward!
- My dear son.
- Come on.
Warm are the loaves
That cool on the sill
To the song of the clear, trickling stream
The good, clean smell
Of the rough woven sheets
The song of the children at play
Oh, the drums are so mournful
My dear, oh, my love
As my thoughts
They are turning your way
Where are the eyes
I beheld with my own?
On that long ago lazy day
On that long ago lazy day
- Francesco, please!
- Come on!
- And tomorrow, we'll ride into battle.
- If we win, do we get all the girls?
Of course,
that's what wars are made for!
It's getting late,
let's go home and prepare.
- War's a serious business.
- Such profundity, Bernardo!
Why?
Why? Bernardo...
What a pity. It's over.
Yes, it's a pity. But I hope we'll live
to see another dawn like this.
The last night of our youth.
Do you realise that?
We try so desperately
to make it never end.
We should have stopped
the sun from rising.
Come on, Francesco!
Wait!
Leave me alone.
Please.
Brothers!
Brothers!
Lepers.
Yes. Lepers.
No!
No! I don't want to see them!
I don't want to see them!
Get them out!
You're not dressed yet?
What've you been doing?
Pica! Please stop
all this sissified nonsense!
The boy's going off to war.
Besides, I don't understand a word!
Why do you leave me out?
Don't speak French around me!
If you wanted a wife
who speaks like you,
why didn't you marry
a butcher's daughter?
Bravo, François!
Forgive me, Father.
Forgive me, Father.
Hey, wait! We must talk!
What shall we do with all the money
we'll make out of this war?
I see!
A true son of his father, eh, Pica?
- We are going to be late for Mass.
- They'll wait. Listen, Francesco.
Out of the way!
Francesco, when you're in Perugia,
don't forget DeGoli's storerooms
behind the marketplace.
- He's as rich as the Pope.
- Yes, leave it to me.
Remember the cathedral triptych.
It'll save us a fortune in indulgences.
Yes. War is beautiful.
This is my death mask.
Go forth, sons of Assisi.
God is with you!
Francesco!
Francesco!
Francesco!
Flowers in the meadow
Softly sway
And all the little birds
Sing merry May Day
Rabbits in the orchard
Sport and play
And all the little creatures
Smile and are gay
My little boy
Sing out your joy
I am near, my dear
My darling, do not fear
Love is all around you Comforting
with gentle lullaby
To make your heart sing
(Fuglesang høres)
(Kirkeklokker blander seg med fuglesangen)
- What's he doing up there?
- That's Bernardone's son.
François! Be careful!
Francesco! Francesco!
Birds are singing sweet and low
From the trees that gently grow
Soft and soothing breezes blow
On this lovely day
To the meadow there go I
To wander as the butterfly
How the flowers please my eye
On this lovely day
I wish it could be always
Life is easy on such a day
I wish this peace on everyone
On this lovely day
On this lovely day
I wish this peace on everyone
On this lovely day
Francesco, what is it?
Francesco, my sweet Francesco,what's happening to you?
You can tell me. We've always
understood each other, we...
We've always been close, you and...
Let me help you, my darling.
Sit down, sit down. Take a drink.
Yes, business is booming,
life's back to normal at last.
Talking of business, I've fine stuff
you won't find anywhere but here.
Look at this damask from Provence.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Feel the texture.
I'd like you to compare this
with one from Venice.
Look at your hands!
Look at your hands!
- Forgive me.
If I find one finger mark on my silks,
I'll beat you till you're black and blue!
You dirty little pig!
These servants are just like animals.
- How's your son? Better now?
- Yes, thank God.
He's cost a fortune in Masses,
but the worst is over.
Now, there we are.
He's begun to get up and soon
he'll be at Mass. Take it into the light.
Do you remember me?
I'm Clare.
People say you're mad.
Do you know that?
When you went off to war,
they said you were fine and intelligent
But now you're mad, because...
...because you sing like the birds,
you chase after butterflies and...
...and you look at flowers.
I think you were mad before, not now.
Am I disturbing you? I'll go...
You see? He talks with her.
Thanks be to God.
That's obviously what was wrong
with him. He needed a woman.
You look at things so clumsily,
Monseigneur.
- His heart awakes.
- Call it what you like.
That lad's after a woman.
That's why he's been acting strangely.
What a lovely creature Clare is.
Not much of a catch, though.
Her father won't pay for a wedding.
Still, if that's what Francesco wants,
we'll find enough money.
Know what?
I'll put him to work again.
- But...
- No buts! You've spoiled him enough.Besides, Francesco's always
been good at business. He likes it.He does. He takes after me.
Always has done.
Come, you shall see.
I followed your advice to the letter.
I bought and bought and bought,and now we prosper.
I may curse the war
for having given you this fever,
but for business it was a blessing.
Come, come, you shall see.
This will set the blood
coursing through your veins.
Better than all those potions and
medicines the women give you!
Eh? Go, go!
Look at that, eh, Francesco.
Look. You see this?
And to think people
speak badly of war, eh?
Come, come, I'll show you!
You know how it started, Francesco?
With the war supplies.
After the war, the soldiers sold their loot.
Then the ones who'd been looted
sold everything they had to rebuild,
practically giving away things.
I'll show you. Look at these.
See these, eh?
Family heirlooms.
Titled people.On their knees, they were.Cost me less than nothing.
This is not all, it's just the beginning.
There's so much more.
We have enough money
to make and sell with 200 workers.
Dyers, weavers... see for yourself.
It belongs to you, too, don't forget.
God bless the master of this house
He be handsome, she be fair
Rings and buckles and bells and bows
A penny a rhyme will do me fine
Tuppence a rhyme I told you so
Rings and buckles and bells and bows
He invited them, if you please,
out for a stroll!
He led them into the sunshine
and they sat there all afternoon!
Nobody did a stroke of work!
And that simpleton, that idiot boy,
he just looked on!
He doesn't get it from me. There's
no insanity in my side of the family!
I've had enough of your airs.
You're not in noble Provence now.
You'll not play the great lady here!
You've pampered him with your
Frenchified airs and graces.
He's nothing more than a cringing idiot.
Something's got to be done.But not by you!
You're a stupid, thick-headed,
vulgar animal. That's what you are!
Don't you understand
what Francesco needs?
He's desperate.
Jesus! I feel like flaying him alive!
Typical of you. You treat him like...
...like one of your clerks who come
through here on whom you stamp!
- But Francesco's not like that.
- No?    No.
And all the fathers and mothers
of Assisi envy us such a son.
So sensitive, so intelligent, so...
This is the envy of Assisi, eh?
Now you've gone far enough!
No son of mine, understand,however mad, will behave like this!
Have you no respect for me?
- You will obey me in everything!
- You'll kill him!
And if you do not,I will thrash you
within an inch of your life!
Is that clear?
Is that understood?
And starting tomorrow morning,
you will come with us to Mass,
even if I have to drag you there
like a dog!
-Francois..
No!
No.
No!
Brother Sun and Sister Moon
I seldom see you
Seldom hear your tune
Preoccupied with selfish misery
Brother Wind and Sister Air
Open my eyes To visions pure and fair
That I may see The glory around me
I am God's creature
Of Him I am part
I feel His love awakening my heart
Brother Sun and Sister Moon
I now do see you I can hear your tune
So much in love
With all that I survey
This is mine!
This one. All of it. And this.
Move! Where is he?
They will never make you happy!
Throw it all away!
Burn it, my brothers, all of it!
You!
But he doesn't realise
what he's doing. Be patient.
Father! Father!
I want to share my joy with you.Our treasures are in heaven,
not here on earth.
Don't be a slave to these.
Throw it all away!
Do as I do. It's so simple.Be free.
No! No, my brothers!
Don't touch that silk,
throw it into the gutter!Throw it all away!They will only make
you miserable. Look at my poor father!Quiet, you idiot!
- Call the guards!
- See how he suffers!
I'll see him hang in the public square!
- It's Pietro di Bernardone, his son...
- What?
- He's only just realised?Better alert the guards.
He's lost his mind.
What's the matter with you?
Have you gone mad as well?
I want justice. And I want it here,
now, in front of all Assisi!
It would be helpful to know the charge.
What has the justice of men
to do with me? God is my only judge.
Unfortunately,
He isn't around to help us out!
Why not go to Bishop Guido?
I'll not interrupt my meal because
of some sordid family squabble.What heresy!
Tell them I'm out.
Say I'm praying or something.
- The town is here.
- They insist the Church intervenes.
It's becoming an outrageous scandal.
God's teeth!
I've only just got over Lent,
and you're imposing another on me!
- But, Your Grace...
- Have it kept hot.
God's teeth! Can a man not
be left alone to dine in peace?
Pietro di Bernardone! This will not do!
How dare you disturb us
in the middle of saying our office!
What's the matter with you?
It's not my fault, Your Grace.
It's him, that lunatic there!
Yes...
...it's me.
My soul is in your hands.
What?
Are you trying to cause trouble?Is that what you're trying to do?
Is this some damn plot
to rob the Church of its authority?
That's nothing to what he's done to me.
God knows I've given him the best.
I've brought him up, I clothed him...
You ask anyone, they'll tell you.He's wanted for nothing
since he was born.
But today, he threw all my belongings
out of the window.
He even opened my strongboxes!
Thrown to a mob of cut-throats.
Years of hard work
and self-sacrifice just...
...just tossed away!
Then, what is the answer
to these accusations?
Surely you are sufficiently
intelligent to understand that Holy Mother Church must punish
those who subvert the established order.
A man such as you is a menace to society.
- He's either criminal or...
- Or someone seeking the light.
Someone in darkness.
I was in darkness.
But Brother Sun illuminated my soul.
And now... I can see so clearly.
Just as you did the day you chose
the sacred vestments you wear now.
Are you seeking holy orders?
Me? No. No.
 I'm not worthy.
Then, what do you want?
I want to be happy.
I want to live like the birds in the sky.
I want to experience the freedom
and the purity that they experience.
The rest is of no use to me.
No use, believe me.
If the purpose of life is this
loveless toil, then it's not for me.
There must be something better.
There has to be.
Man is a spirit.
He has a soul.
And that, that is what
I want to recapture, my soul.
I want to live.
I want to live in the fields..
stride over hills,
climb trees, swim rivers.
I want to feel the earth beneath my feet...
Without shoes. Without possessions.
Without those shadows
we call our servants.
I want to be a beggar. Yes!
Yes, a beggar.
Christ was a beggar, And his holy apostles were beggars.
- I want to be as free as they are.
- But, Your Grace...
...even beggars show respect
for their fathers!
I'm not your son any more.
What?
What is born of the flesh is flesh.
What is born of the spirit is spirit.
I, now, am born again.
Father, I give you back everything that belongs to you.
Your clothes...
...Your possessions.
Your name, too.
There are no more fathers.
There are no more sons.
And everyone who has left
houses or brothers or sisters,or fathers or mothers
 or children,
or fields,
for the sake of Our Heavenly Father,will receive a hundred times more
in the life to come.
Cover him! Cover him up!
Hey, come and see!
Look at the crusader.
Bernardo di Quintevalle?
Welcome. Welcome home.
As I present the keys of the city to the Emperor,it would hardly be right of me
to present them from the rear!
- This is not a religious ceremony!
- My dear Governor...
Otto of Brunswick is going to Rome
to be crowned Emperor.
How can you possibly say
 this is not a religious ceremony?
God moves in mysterious ways,
my dear secretary,
and he has ordained on this occasion
that I move forward.
This is pure blasphemy!
Do you suggest you are in direct
communication with the word of God?
Silvestro, come here!
Paolo...
Something really marvellous has happened. Guess what?
- What?
- Bernardo's back.
Yes. He just rode in through the gates.
- He looks fantastic.
- Yes!
Let's not discuss it further.
Everyone will have his assigned place.
But you are here,
streets ahead of me!
Couldn't have arrived at a more appropriate time.
Let's meet tonight and celebrate.
Hey, Bernardo!
How do you like your chicken?
Leg? Or breast?
- The only one that stayed the same.
- No, he's going back to his youth.
Why else would he choose
this place to celebrate your return from the crusade?
Crusades are nothing to sing about actually.
Come on, Bernardo, you're famous.You're a war hero.
You must have slaughtered
thousands of Muslims!
How many, at a rough guess,
would you say you'd killed?
Too many.
Well, where's Francesco?
- He doesn't live in Assisi any more.
- I gathered that.
Where is francesco?
You're not still talking about him,
are you? We told you, he's mad.
- What do you mean?
Do not listen to him, Bernardo.
- Take no notice, he's pissed as usual.
Francesco isn't mad, is he, Paolo?
He's not mad. He's... changed.
He is mad! A raving bloody lunatic!
Only a lunatic would believe that
God himself had come to talk to him.
- God has spoken to lots of people.
- How interesting.
You think God personally decided
that San Damiano should be rebuilt?
San Damiano? Rebuild...?
- Is that where's he's living?
- Yes, I suppose so.
Is he all right?
Surely to God, one of you
went along to see him, speak to him.
- You must have done something.
- Look...
He is our oldest...
...and dearest friend.
He might need our help.
Bernardo, listen to me,not Giocondo, he's drunk.
Francesco's not mad.
Maybe he's very sane indeed.But as a hero of the crusades,you can't have your name
associated with his, none of us can.
Francesco's been
a great friend to us all, but...
...quite simply, we have nothing
in common any more.
If you want your dream to be
Build it slow and surely
Small beginnings, greater ends
Heartfelt work grows purely
If you want to live life free
Take your time ... Go slowly
Do few things, but do them well
Simple joys are holy
Day by day, stone by stone
Build your secret slowly
Day by day, you'll grow, too
You'll know heaven's glory
If you want your dream to be
Build it slow and surely
Small beginnings, greater ends
Heartfelt work grows purely
If you want to live life free
Take your time, go slowly
Francesco...   Are you all right?
- I'm very well, Bernardo. And you?
Listen to me for just a minute.
I want to help you.
Words...Words, Bernardo.
There was a time
when I believed in words.
During all those months in prison,
we talked so much about you.
We were sure you were dead.
When they freed us,
I have decided to join the crusades.And it was in Jerusalem
that I heard that you were alive.
But I was surprised by what they said,
that you had abandoned the life
that you once loved so much.
You were looking for a new purpose,
a new meaning. 
You were right.
I tried that, too. Only for me, it failed.
Yet it's too easy to blame the crusades
for this emptiness,this dissatisfaction I feel.
The horror of war,
the destruction of our ideals is part of it I know,
but there's something else.
I feel stifled by my past,
by my upbringing.
None of it means anything to me any more.
And you francesco,you know better than anyone else
that I cannot live without an ideal.
with nothing to believe in
Perhaps I'm wrong and I should be
more cynical and forget ideals.
That's why I thought
I had to come and talk to you.
- What's the matter?
- That would make a worthy cornerstone.
Strong...
...and true.
Where did you get these?
Some quarry near here?
Yes. It's not far.
I can take you there if you like.
Thank you, Bernardo.
Oh, come and let yourselves be built
as living stones...unto a spiritual temple.
Don't be such a fool!
I'm telling you, Bernardo's a ruddy genius.
He knew all you wanted was
to trot him out like a circus act.
- We've got to get Bernardo back.
- Go on!
Oh, you can just go home!
Bernardo, listen.
Paolo wants to talk with you.
You're to present
the keys of the city to Emperor Otto.
It's a great honour.
You're the only one who can make peace
between the governor and the bishop.
Are you listening to me?
Bernardo please, you must come back!
- It's for the Emperor himself.
- No. There's nothing I want to say to
an emperor who slaughters the innocent.
No Bernardo, there's a lot one could say
to an emperor.
There, even Francesco agrees with me.
- What should I say to an emperor Francesco?
- Well... what could you say?
Well, you could tell him
to throw his sceptre in the mud.Or to fling his jewels into the river.
Then he'd see the glow of some
new colours amongst the pebbles.And you could say ..
 "Otto of Brunswick,
let the birds nest in your crown,"
"let heaven's winds blow
through your palaces."
"What good is your life if your riches
bring you no peace of mind and all your people starve?"
- That's what should be said.
- You mustn't listen to him,I warn you. If you say such things,
you'd better stay here!
- You'll both be burned at the stake!
- Stop bleating.And Consider that Francesco and Bernardo and the way they live,
have more in keeping with the gospels
than you and your lawyer friend.The bishop of palace
You were the one who laughed longest
and loudest at Francesco's antics!
Ahh shut up...
That's true, but I always laugh when I don't understand.
- You've got marbles for brains!
I tell you something else, I understand your dilemma.
Now get back to Paolo,
you pathetic little prig!
We'll settle our scores later, Giocondo!
- Get back to the convent!
- You just wait and see!
Bye.
Idiot! I send you to get Bernardo
and you come back without him.
Where's Giocondo?
Where is Giocondo?
Bah!
Throw your sceptre in the mud!
Fling your jewels in the river!
Let the birds nest in your crown!
What good is your miserable life,when you steal from the poor,
steal from the poor,slaughter the innocent
 and hoard gold
while your countrymen starving to dead?
 -He'll be punished!
What have I done?
I've done it.
I did it, Francesco!
Francesco!
We are given to understand,
my learned friend, that you have..That you have joined the ranks
of the State Legislature.
And your understanding
is based on misunderstanding.
I haven't joined anybody,I'm on nobody's side.
I've simply offered my services to the city
to help stamp out the contagion of San Damiano.
Your Grace, we are told that the cream of the city's
youth has already been curdled..by contact with this eccentric
little community.
They are restoring a consecrated ruin for love.
Is that a crime?
They have cast away all their possessions.
They've cast away all our possessions,
which is a very different matter!
Yes, indeed, a very different matter.
A state matter.
If you thought Francesco might start an uprising,
you should have judged him yourself before passing on to me.
I could not fault his desire to live
in poverty like Christ and the apostles.
Don't be discouraged. At least
we're not thirsty and well washed!
Forgive and you shall be forgiven,
and live in simplicity.
- Get away!
- Move off, idiots!
Get out, pig!
Here, see if you like this!
Thank you, brother.
-brother?You're no brother of mine.
For Sister Poverty
We give thanks
For Brother Want
We give thanks
God give you grace!
God give you peace, brother!
come
-For Sister Rain
-We give thanks
-For Brother Hail
-We give thanks 
"-Blessed are the meek,
for they shall inherit the earth.."
"How blessed are those who show mercy,
for mercy shall be shown to them."
"How blessed are the peacemakers.
God shall call them His sons."
Giocondo.
- What's the matter?
- God forgive me, a miserable sinner.
- God forgive me, a miserable sinner.
- God forgive me, a miserable sinner....
- He probably heard you the first time.
Go away. Leave me alone.
Tell me.
I can take all the rest,the cold, the hunger.
But there are days and nights
when I'd gladly face eternal damnation for one moment of love.
I'll ruin everything you've tried to do,
Francesco.
I can't go on.
But you don't have to.
We're not a regiment of priests for whom
the sacred vow of chastity is a discipline.
We're just a band of men
who simply love God,each according to his own capacity.
But if Giocondo finds the lack
of a woman distracts him from God,then he should marry and
breed to his heart's content.
You didn't cut my hair before.
You knew I was weak.
You knew this would happen.
If everyone took the vow of chastity,
the human race would end.
Be fruitful and multiply.
But with a wife, remember!
For Sister Chastity
We give thanks
For Brother Love
We give thanks
Francesco.
Clare..
God be with you, Francesco.
Always. And pray for me.
- No.
- No.
They have been working with us today.
Let's share.
- There'll be less for us!
- They're poorer than us.
Poor? They're the sons of landowners,
sons of the rich!
Go and look for bread in your own home.
Why steal from us, the real poor?
We are all poor in the eyes of our Lord.
Lord, make me
An instrument of Your peace
Where there is hatred
Let me sow love
Where there is injury
Let me sow pardon
Where there is doubt
Let me sow faith
It is in giving that we receive
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned
It is in dying that we are born
That we are born to eternal life
Francesco!
Claire!
You shouldn't have come.
But I knew you would.
I have to tell you, and I don't care
if the whole world knows it.
From now on, I want to live as you live.
Don't send me away because
I'm a woman with little strength.
I'm not seeking to be understood any more.
I want to understand.
I'm not asking to be loved.
I want to love!
Where there is sadness, please,
please, help me find joy.
Claire..
Lord...
...make me an instrument of Your peace.
- Morning. 
Welcome to the church.
Give him to me.
Now stay here.
For us.
If you want your dream to be
Take your time, go slowly
Do few things, but do them well
Heartfelt work grows purely
If you want to live life free
Take your time, go slowly
Do few things, but do them well
Heartfelt work grows purely
Day by day, stone by stone
Build your secret slowly
Day by day, you'll grow, too
You'll know heaven's glory
If you want to live life free
take your time , go slowly
Do few things but do them well
Heartfelt work grows purely
If you want to live life free
Take your time, go slowly
Do few things, but do them well
You'll know heaven's glory...
Good night, Your Grace.
Father of all things
Mother of light
Soothe and ease our human plight
Mary in mercy
Jesus in joy
Please will you help us win the fight?
There's a shape in the sky
Beckoning me
There's a sound in the wild wind
Calling
There's a song to be sung
For glory
And I feel that it's coming our way
There's a pain on the land
Weakening me
There's a sigh in the city of sorrow
There's a shadow of darkness
Accumulating
And I feel that it's coming our way
There's a love for all men
Sleeping within
There's a friend of a friend awakening
There's a jubilant joy bursting to be
And I feel that it's coming our way
Father of all things
Mother of light
Soothe and ease our human plight
Mary in mercy
Jesus in joy
Please will you help us win the fight?
Francesco!
Come! The church!
Come on.
- Bring some water.
- Call Francesco.
Look, he's coming.
- Francesco! Francesco, look!
- What happened?
- The bishop's soldiers came.
They wanted to close the church.
He wouldn't let them in.
He started fighting and called for help.
He wouldn't let them in.
He started fighting and called for help.
He screamed and screamed
and kicked them.
- Then they pushed him.
- They strangled him.
Why?
Why?
Who could have such....
..such hatred for such a creature?
What did I do wrong?
I must know.
I must... understand.
Somebody has to help me understand.
Somebody has to help me.
And there is someone.
If He would ..
Water!
Look, who's that?
There. Who's that, coming there?
Come on, let's go and see.
Francesco!
You mustn't go to Rome, do you hear?
You mustn't go to Rome
- Why mustn't he go to Rome?
- Never mind why, Bernardo!
- Just bring him back to Assisi.
- That's impossible, Paolo;You know that.
Francesco, listen to me,
not as a friend,, for I may no longer call myself
your friend,
but you must come back to Assisi.
No.
I must go to Rome
to find out what I've done wrong.
What you've done wrong?
Save yourself the journey!
I can tell you, quite categorically,
you've done everything wrong!
Everything! From when you ran away from the war remember?
and abandoned your friends,
and acted like a lunatic
to cover up your cowardice.
Don't talk like that.
You're just jealous.
I've good reason! He's had everything
I've had to scheme for.
Riches, women, position, popularity.
Even God!
One fine morning you just pluck God out of the air
as easily as catching a butterfly!
It's too simple!
If what you say is true,
then the Holy Father will soon
point out the errors in my faith.
The Pope?
you...
So, you still think
you'll be able to see the Pope?
Just look at yourselves,
the pride of Assisi!
Filthy, starving, reduced to the gutter.
And this is how you hope to find
an audience with His Holiness?
-Good luck, my friends.
Paolo!You could help me.
- You know what to do.
Francesco.. Go home. I've enough money
to see you all back safely.
Paolo, help me to see the Pope.
What if If I do succeed,
and there's very little likelihood,
it will be on my terms, is that clear?
Yes, of course.
Everybody, make way, please.
Everybody!
Make way, please.
Read it out exactly
in the way it is written here,changing nothing, do you understand?
- Francesco!
- I'm sorry.
Read it out word for word. A masterpiece of evangelical strategy.
I almost believe it myself.
And remember What you must make absolutely clear is that you recognise
the supreme authority of the Pope.
When you've made your submission,
you will withdraw.
I've arranged for horses for you,
all of us, to return to Assisi.
Once there,
I will do everything in my power to reconcile you with the city.
Paolo, why are you doing all this?
Because,in your simple-minded zeal,you could all be burned as heretics.
And besides,
I don't want a martyr on my conscience.
They're hermits from Assisi, here
to make submission to Your Holiness.
Their leader is Francesco.
Just an ordinary blessing, Your Holiness,
to gratify bishop Guido.
You asked permission to speak to us.
Well, speak!
Speak!
(He reads Latin)
Why?
Why?
Look at the birds of the air.
They do not sow or reap.
Or store in barns.
Yet our Heavenly Father feeds them.
Is there any man among you,
who, by anxious thought?
can add a minute to his life?
Or a foot to his height?Why the concern for your riches?
Consider how the lilies grow in the fields.
They do not work nor spin.
Yet even Solomon, in all his splendour,
was not attired like one of these.
How little faith you have.
You ask, "What are we to eat?
"What are we to drink?
What are we to wear?"
When all these things are
for the pagans to run after, not for you.
Set your mind on God's kingdom
and His justice before everything else,and all the rest will come to you as well.
- But this is Matthew!
- How dare he lecture us on the gospel!
Do not store your treasure here on earth,
where there is rust and moth to devour it,
where thieves will break in and steal it.
But store your treasure in heaven,
where there is no rust,no moth,nor thief to steal.
For where your treasure is...
...there will your heart be also.
- This is enough!
- Arrest him!
- Out! Call the guards!
- Blasphemy!
Out! Out!
How little faith you have!
No man can serve two masters,
for he will hate the one
and love the other.
Or he will be devoted to one
and despise the other!
You cannot serve both God and money.
-Francesco!
-Paolo.
Forgive me. You took so much trouble.
- You come, too.
- No. Not him. He's not with us.
- Tell him, Paolo, you're not with us.
- Tell him.
I am with them.
Then go with them! Quiet, quiet!
Move along!
Your Holiness, I'm dreadfully sorry. Forgive this outrage.
We were misinformed. We were told
this was a humble group of hermits.
Shall we suspend the audience?
Do you wish to retire, Your Holiness?
Your Holiness.
- Where is he?
- Who, Your Holiness?
- Where is that man?
- Our guards have arrested him.
Call him back! Bring him here! Immediately
What do you want of us?
I have often watched the larks
in the fields around my home.
They are such humble,
modest creatures,who need only a sip of water
and a few berries in order to live
and soar into the heavens.
One day, I found myself thinking
that we, too, could be happy,
if we were content with little,
like the larks,if we could live as they live, singing
and thanking the Lord who created us.
And that is why we came to Rome,
to ask your advice.
What advice can I possibly give you,
my dear young brother?
God has given you a most precious gift,
the grace to approach Him through His beloved creatures.
- What more can you want?
- Simple people understand us.
But the others...
Perhaps we have made mistakes.
We want to know.
Is it not possible, Holy Father, to live
according to the teachings of our Lord?
Or have we sinned
through presumption?
If that be the case, we would like
Your Holiness to tell us of our errors.
My dearest son, errors will be forgiven.
In our obsession with original sin,
we do often forget original innocence.
Don't let that happen to you.
You've brought me, dear children,
great joy and a little sadness.
I, too, started my vocation long ago
in much the same way as you.
But, with time,
all that enthusiasm passed,and the responsibilities of church government took hold of me.
As you can see
 And what will happen to those who come after you?
But if it be true for us,
how can it not be true for them?
We are encrusted with riches and power.
You, in your poverty...
...put us to shame.
Francesco...
Francesco.
Go in the name of Our Lord Jesus Christ.
Preach the truth to all men.
May your disciples increase
a thousand-fold
and flourish like the palm tree.
Our Lord be with you.
In your hands...
...and in your feet.
Don't be alarmed.
His Holiness knows what he's doing.
This is the man who will speak
to the poor and bring them back to us.
(Chorus: Gloria in exelsis Deo, etc. ..)
Brother Sun and Sister Moon
I seldom see you Seldom hear your tune
Preoccupied with selfish misery
Brother Wind and Sister Air
Open my eyes To visions pure and fair
That I may see The glory around me
I am God's creature
Of Him I am part
I feel His love Awakening my heart
Brother Sun and Sister Moon
I now do see you
I can hear your tune
So much in love
With all that I survey
I am God's creature
Of Him I am part
I feel His love Awakening my heart
Brother Sun and Sister Moon
I now do see you
I can hear your tune
So much in love
With all that I survey
