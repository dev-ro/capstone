- What do we have at Kallebäck junction?
- 1830 ... We come from Göteborgsvägen.
This is violence against the officer.
Or what is going on?
This is the only bulb that works.
Otherwise you had been fumbling in the dark.
Should not include bulbs
when you lease it?
Can't you come here next weekend?
How can I check out apartments.
We should aim for the villa directly.
No.
Do you have to go back to The Hague?
I can't fast track my career
because you got a new job.
We'll move homes
when Nina starts at Chalmers.
- If she enters.
- She will.
See you this weekend, 0la.
- Are you working now, Daddy?
- No. Tomorrow I get to work.
Now I sleep
and you should too.
You could get some sleep on the plane.
Goodbye.
Take care now.
You too.
- You is not just you anymore.
- No ...
- You are no youth, either.
- Thank you.
Goodbye.
To Landvetter, thanks.
Goodbye.
Howdy.
- Falcon.
- Borglund.
- How is the situation?
- Just fine.
I heard you were back.
- In addition, GSI.
- Exactly.
It is well suited to you, you bastard.
Anja working tonight?
No, she is running 8 to 5.
- GSI is the fifth floor, huh?
- They say so, yes.
Johan Falk. I'll start working here.
It is you, yes. Math.
Come in.
Six bedrooms zero.
Wearing black suit
2001. Understood. When we appear soon.
Mum, can you pass
line up to picket?
It is done. And I have
prepared the map.
Brilliant, Mum. Send me the latest
weather report and traffic situation.
The rain can ...
You just missed them.
They came to play.
They are down in the garage unpacking.
Hello.
Hey, you old bastard cop.
- What's up?
- Good.
- You are a day early.
- I thought I'd hook up now.
Yeah?
- Something funny going on?
- No, nothing special.
Listen up, everybody. This is
Johan Falk, a new liaison officer
Between us, National Crime, Europol
and Interpol. Say hello to uncle.
- Lasse.
- Johan.
- Dick Jorgensen.
- Johan.
Sophie.
Hey.
Good to see you.
- What's up?
- Good. It is crap long ago.
15 years minimum.
Are you still married to Helen?
Yes. and you?
No, you know how I am.
It's fun, for Patrick, Johan
and I was in Northern Ireland ...
I'd forgotten.
- Then there's His Construction today.
- No. El-Olle.
El-Olle is much more fun.
We would change the
organization from within.
There is a rumor
you have done that too, right?
What do say you, Patrick?
- Johan, you were in 0rganized Crime?
- That's right.
- All five years?
- Yes.
- Five?
- I may just be there in five years.
For the risk of corruption.
A day to many
and you became corrupt.
- You are with me and Sofie.
- Yeah.
Johan.
- Fancy car.
- Isn't it?
Jump in.
- Don't break anything so now.
- No, no.
Subject crossing the center.
07 I'll take over.
He thought we take in the night.
Eric Dávod.
Importer. Heroin.
We've been watching him and think
he sells a large lot in the night.
Surveillance said
he is on his way to his workplace.
- and buyer?
- Don't we know who it is.
However, we suspect Dávod has
links to a cash robbery.
- Why do you believe it?
- Little things.
Yeah.
There he is.
Try to get everyone he talks to.
- Do you have something sweet, Patrik?
- I'm not a kiosk.
- Do you have something sweet, or?
- No.
Brothers Barduli. Albanians.
He is in the taxi Joey Söslük.
Leader of a suburban gang.
Convenient to work the door there.
Then you can do business with the bus
but it can be connected legally.
Johan, you have to
been abroad for a while ...
Why is the police force here
"Snow White and the Six Dwarfs"?
Wait. Wasn't it the seven dwarfs?
No, Gothenburg
we don't wise crack.
The Rydell gang is coming now.
The crew-cut guy is Seth Rydell,
he formed the gang in Kumla.
Tassel - Martin Borhult.
Bakåtslicket - Frank Wagner.
In total around 20 in the club.
Half sitting inside.
Mostly for life.
Thoroughbred Psychopaths all.
- So you had no intention of paying us?
- Seth, yeah. You'll get your money.
What are you doing anything?
So, now you go home. Goodbye.
When it was over for tonight.
So where are the bucks then?
Everyone goes out of here, now!
What the hell are you doing?
Do you want me to repeat the question?
As soon as I get my money
you'll get yours.
- It wasn't what we said.
- Seth, damn, it's the way it is.
Who delivered the cars to you then?
So we can collect the debt ourselves.
Do you know who I am?
We all see who you are.
A tramp who can't pay.
Seth. I can't tell
whom I delivered the cars to.
But you'll get your money.
You got it from elsewhere,
you little whore.
You understand there will be interest.
100%. Do you?
You have made yourself.
You've done business with our money
and put us in a bloody situation.
You'll be glad you still
can pay out of this.
Are you Ok?
Ok ...
Take it easy.
It's me.
We need to talk. Now.
Don't hang on those guys?
We don't know who the buyer is.
01-10, 12, 13. You hang on
Rydell-gang. Surveillance is waiting.
- 12. Understood.
- 13. Understood.
10 Understood.
To the left, with the scarf:
Chris Amir.
- What has happened here?
- You were fast.
I was on the other side of the block
when you called.
Are you nervous, right?
You look a little stressed out.
Rather a little on the job stress.
Can we do it tonight?
I met our man
two hours ago.
He would also like to as soon as possible.
He has all the money. It is serious.
Dávod.
- I'll have my 5 % directly.
- Ready as hell.
Chris Amir is known to put together
drug deals so he isn't the buyer.
01 to all. Cut if off.
We put ourselves and the subject after
the man with the scarf, Chris Amir.
Amir also played down
police procedure last week.
- 15-45. Understood.
- 15-40. Understood.
10, 12, 13. What's happening?
Rydell and Borhult are standing
eating ice cream with two broads.
And Wagner?
Wagner went go to his bar.
- Hello.
- Howdy.
- Have you closed the till?
- Mm.
- How much was it?
- Nearly eighty thousand.
- Eighty?
- Eighty.
Then you have a new letter.
From the bailiff.
It's located in the office.
Ok.
money isn't required for
ten days and we'll make more.
- 87,000
- I got it.
- Have you cashed out?
- No.
Remove the float, so you can share
the tips with the girls.
No. Are you sure?
See ya.
How does it feel to sit back
and not having full control?
01-13. Rydell, Borhult continue to eat
ice cream. But with new broads.
- And Wagner?
- Wagner has jumped on a tram.
No. 5 north bound.
01. Understood. Stay with your item
until we know where he's going.
01-10. I have lost him.
01. Understood.
Can you locate him?
Frank Wagner has become a ghost
or done something damn advanced.
I followed the tram
to the terminus.
Everyone stepped off except Wagner.
I searched the tram, but
only the driver is left.
Hello!
The whole family together.
Why suddenly so quiet.
- Where's Mom?
- So it's finally time to come now?
Yes.
Hello.
Are you sad?
Not at all. That's all right.
You don't want some jewelry
so you get this instead.
"for mum."
There is a tasting menu
with wine tasting. I cook everything.
Bring the ladies, if you want.
More coffee and cake?
Ove? Christian?
No. We have to go to work.
Thank you, I would appreciate
some more coffee.
Was it that Barbro ...
Couldn't you stay a little longer?
To get up so dramatically!
Listen to me, sister.
I just sit at the table with
him because it's your birthday.
- Bloody way to come so late.
- You came too late.
- We had to work.
- Perhaps he did too.
Hell, it wouldn't surprise me.
Where's Frank?
Did you fuss with her
before I came?
She's been crying.
I talked to her before you came.
Can't you see what you do to her?
You are her son.
The biggest criminal pig
I know.
How do you feel for her?
It's a damn lucky
she has a son.
Can he be such a rowdy shit
that he keeps drugs there?
Piket here. We are on site.
01, understood. Welcome.
From  15-40. Amir is at Café Tilda.
Hercules Street, two blocks from you.
01, understood.
I'll have a smoke.
Or?
- The buyer is here now.
- Ok.
The buyer in place, subject on the way down.
30 seconds for a response.
I repeat: the buyer is on site.
- Ten seconds.
- The buyer has left.
- Five seconds.
- I repeat: the buyer is not there.
Go, go, go.
What the hell!
It's easy!
I know. But I didn't see him.
Andersson, Lars, 630815-6295.
Did you see the buyer?
He is still there
or we missed him.
Serious narcotics several times.
- Congratulations.
- It was you who found it.
- Has everything gone well?
- Yes.
Here you had fun while we have
watching thugs eating ice cream.
Don't get bitter.
I haven't ripped you off deliberately.
Good job.
How does it feel to work in the field
after being a desk jockey?
Well, damn.
It felt great.
See you tomorrow.
Goodbye.
Mmm ...
- Johan Falk?
- Yes.
Jäger  Lennart Ström,
county police.
What then?
We may set up a get together ...
Can you hang on for a bit?
Hello?
Hello.
The Operation Head doesn't let
anyone in or out.
- What the hell has happened?
- An armoured car.
Shots have been fired. The robbers
set fire to several vehicles.
Cars drove up in front of the
Police garage and blocked the entrance.
we suspect there's a bomb.
Forensics is investigating right now.
- Ok. Other units then?
- The investigation team is there too.
What the hell!
Hey, old man.
- What is it?
- I haven't slept.
That's how it is when one has children.
I missed you of course.
Is it the one he got from Stephen?
What is it, old man?
The appropriate word now.
I've been thinking about
what we talked about.
About quiting?
It isn't just any shit
happening out there and ...
I feel like a fucking serf.
I don't like what I'm about to become.
I was on my mother's 60th
birthday party yesterday.
I don't think I understood
how much I have damaged her.
She reads in the newspaper
her son is a serious criminal.
And there's nothing in the newspaper
about Ove and Christian.
I was really happy to see her.
It's not
to defect anyway.
But I think you have to do it.
- He has been quite sick now.
- How do you talk with him?
... The situation is shocking.
The second raid
in Gothenburg in just one week.
We let the fences now.
Johan?
- Hey, hey.
- Hello.
- I heard you came in yesterday.
- Yes. Absolutely.
Hello.
So you should talk to GSI.
Good to the appointed
such a service to the end.
Nice uniforms.
We saw you long ago.
It was a while since we last met.
- Anything new about the robbery?
- Yes, I agree to the investigation.
We must hold a team meeting now
and see how we can move forward.
The prosecutor has asked to detain
Eric Dávod and Chris Amir.
Good. And the buyer? Do you
know anything?
No, we didn't grab him.
- So you've started smoking?
- I? No. What the hell ...
I saw you from the window.
Everyone smokes down there.
Fucking Euro policemen. What do you do?
Not a word to Helen.
What then, do you smoke secretly?
What a hassle.
Before your son too?
How old is he now? Four?
Five.
Ola.
After Sellberg.
And you? Do you?
No, I have to meet someone first
to have children with.
Ok, mmm ... yes, yes.
- Johan?
- Howdy.
The guy in question.
I have heard you arrested them
last night.
Good. Have you got anything?
They are hardened thugs.
They reply only to "coffee or tea?".
We'll see what the search provides.
Check out the stuff that's just
not drug related also.
Especially for Dávod. Things may
be connected to the raid.
- While he was inside, then?
- Yes.
- Were you at the meeting?
- No, he is with me.
Jäger Power. Welcome. The meeting
was in session when I called earlier.
We have been locked up here
all morning.
I have only been able to stare out
through the window like a fucking aquarium.
Imagine the headlines tomorrow:
"Now it's criminals
that barred the police."
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Hello.
And now they're desperate.
The boxes they got last week
contained only 20 kronor notes.
- This morning, they got hardly anything either.
- Do we know they are the same robbers?
There are always six of them. Internally,
they're called "The six unknown"
They and their modus operanti
look similar to many other criminals.
Math. Can you start?
They shot ... they shot me.
This is a zoomed image of the
surveillance camera at 7-Eleven
At. 8:47 this morning.
The sound has been sync'ed. It is
alarm cry of the watchman on the ground.
- Hello? Can you hear me?
- Yes, Anna, we hear you.
You may just help, Anna.
Try to stay awake.
They shot me. I believe he
is the leader. he shot me.
Anna? Can you hear me?
When will the police come? Hello?
- Anna?
- They shot me in the stomach.
It's cold.
I'll just go up to the team meeting
and tells us what we are going to do.
There are more stories than these
describing how the police are at a loss.
But we know the truth
behind the headlines is different.
Drop everything else and concentrate
on capturing these robbers.
- Murderers.
- We don't know who they are.
Rumor around town claims there's
a group of Swedish guys.
You said yesterday Dávod had something
to do with crooks.
- What do you base it on?
- Rumors on the street.
We must analyze it here.
There are approximately 200 heavy
duty criminal thugs in the region
Of which 100 are capable of
carrying out a robbery like this.
So we don't have to check on them all.
We'll do what we did with the Albanian
and the Turkish gangs.
We infiltrate their organizations
with informants and get rid of them.
What are the regular police doing? we
seem to do anything to achieve a result?
She will probably want both.
- Any questions?
- No.
Ok, here we go.
As we planned it here.
Ann-Louise, Spark. Come, Nisse.
I never get used to this shit.
We haven't had time to talk yet.
Formally.
Please sit.
I heard you're married.
Partner, girlfriend or whatever
the hell they call it?
In any case they remain down there.
What do you expect with the job?
Results. It's what you're well known for?
No outside authority in any case.
You've done a fantastic job
with the group.
What's the secret of success?
National Police have
put it in a mission statement.
We will be "cutting-edge policing
against serious, organized crime."
As cutting-edge, we require
more resources than the other units.
And?
- Should I be honest?
- Yes, please.
It took a while before I decided
to accept you.
It's a long time since you were an
operational policeman. So special efforts.
The world might not look now
as it once did.
Really?
And it might never have been the
way you understood it.
Thugs are the black pieces and we're
the white ones. Didn't you say so?
How else would it be?
But you are unsure,
why am I here?
- I was persuaded.
- By whom?
The important thing is
you're here now.
Patrick, now the stuff happens.
We gotta go.
We received a tip at least one of
the robbers is at Gothia Towers Hotel.
We go in about two minutes.
Including reinforcements.
Fiber optic cameras,
Wall microphones and wall radar.
Then we'll need the suitcases
with stickers from Rome and Miami.
Again?
- Johan.
- Yes?
I want to seal off
two blocks around the hotel
If something causes trouble for us.
Ok.
We'll enter as civilians.
Yes, just fine.
We're grateful.
Room 1602 Western tower.
We've got 1603 the room next door
And a room at each end of the
corridor. 1610 and 1620
Sophie. Fiber optic cameras
for all three rooms.
- Piket?
- They are here in ten minutes.
Piket always first on the scene ...
- Somethings don't change.
- Right.
We shouldn't prejudge anyone
initially.
We will identify them
to take as many as possible.
Questions?
- 01-13. Radio Cars on the entry.
- 2001, understood. Repeat.
The two radio cars to the entrance.
Four colleagues are about to enter.
And they won't eat lunch.
98-01 visiting colleagues are
entering the Gothia Towers Hotel.
- Police communications center.
- Hello. Falk here at GSI.
Four colleagues are about to enter
Gothia Towers.
I need to contact them.
Hang on.
I should go up
and preparation the rooms.
Tommy, you follow Sophie.
- 13-01, we are entering.
- It's understood.
Sorry, but the elevator isn't safe.
- Why?
- Because I said. This way.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you kindly.
98-01 colleagues on their way into
Gothia Towers Hotel, have arrived.
We need an answer now.
the issue has moved on.
Good, then I know it.
The four colleagues are on
the same floor as us.
Someone bastard is beating his
wife in room 1618
Lasse, take the elevator up two
floors higher and check the stairs.
Johan and I are going
two stories above the subjects.
Dick, you are still here and observe.
It is not certain the
thugs will stay in the room.
Here we go.
I need you over here.
I have to go through the exit.
10 and 11 by 2001.
Patrol Cars are here for
the man beating his wife,
in room 1618
- The same level with the subjects.
- Copy that.
Speaking of the wife beater ... When
will you kick out your fucking man?
- My husband isn't a wife beater.
- Not far from it.
- I won't discuss it now.
- When are we gonna do it then?
- Why don't you get rid of him?
- He's my daughter's father?
You do like being tough.
Now I understand why
you never had a relationship.
What the hell, floor 15?
Perhaps more broads at once.
10-01?
11-01?
01-12. 16th Floor It wasn't here.
It must have come from the 15th
Understood.
Start with safe room 1602
Understood.
13-01. Lock all the elevators now.
We must block the elevators - now.
They haven't got past Lasse on the
16th floor, so they're still there.
One floor up. Steps.
- Police! Drop your weapon.
- I'm the police. Karlsson, GSI.
- Fuck, yeah!
- You don't give a shit!
Sit here. Hands behind your back.
01-13. Nobody has come down
to reception
So I'll empty the lobby.
- Joachim, empty the lobby now!
- Evacuate the lobby!
- You have a master key card, huh?
- Yes.
Open 1602 silently.
In 1602 and secured the site.
Nobody has passed upwards.
Damn ... Cover me!
Sophie, are you Ok?
The vest took the shots.
Tommy!
We need more ambulances
immediately. Colleagues shot.
Tommy, look at me.
Tommy!
Frank!
Frank ...
Give me Lasse.
Lasse. Elevator to the 15th floor.
Tommy and Sophie are hurt.
Tommy seriously.
The perpetrators are still here.
Understood.
Johan, the stairs!
- Frank ...
- You can do this.
Come on, Tommy!
Two men with automatic weapons
are on the way down the stairs.
Joachim, get everybody out
of here now!
- Further, it's serious!
- Move!
Tommy? Tommy!
Frank Wagner.
Yes, I didn't see him.
But I saw the other.
Beard, shaved head
and leather jacket, I think.
- Frank Wagner?
- Yes.
- We'll take him.
- Mm.
I mean, we got him.
You Ok? Keep you away?
- It went well. You?
- It went well.
- What would you do? Setting up or?
- No, we continue.
- I'll call you.
- Ok.
Both rooms. 1602 and the floor
below that they came out of ...
He was dead when you took over.
They were rented in false names.
- We don't know who the other was?
- No.
I could barely see anything.
Average Length, beard, shaved head.
He may have had a leather jacket.
- How are you?
- I got a fucking slam only.
Patrik. You and I have an envelope
to open in my office.
It's a nation wide alert
for Wagner now.
Piket will check all the addresses
we have on him.
Frank Wagner, 30, unmarried, no children.
Has an apartment at 18 Victoria Street
Appears in investigations
for aggravated assault and theft.
He is a heavily armed
Former Foreign Legionere.
This means knowing how to use
many unpleasant weapons.
It's me. Are you alone?
- Have you checked the news?
- No.
A policeman has been shot to death.
I was there and will probably
to get accused of it.
Wait.
What are you saying?
You hear a lot of shit,
but, you know I'm innocent.
The police who were ...
It was Tommy at GSI.
- Jesus.
- We can do this, Marie.
We can do this also.
Forgive us into storms like this.
I recognize you. You worked
in Kungsbacka, huh?
Yes. Me and Christian,
her second son.
But ...
You shouldn't apologize. We aren't
the ones with a fucking pig in the family.
He lacks empathy
for other living creatures.
See you tomorrow, Mom.
- Mom?
- Mm ...
Bye, Jossan.
Is she somebody's girl friend?
- Wagner?
- Yes.
- No serious in this case.
- Ok. Damn.
No, but his. My God.
I just want to
to express my sympathy.
- Who are his immediate family?
- Tommy?
I will just speak to
his parents.
- Falk.
- Criminal Police Commissioner.
Anja.
After we inquired Dávod ...
He says nothing.
... We did a search of him
And found the keys to a garage
on Högsbo in the industrial area.
Forensics got three sets
of tire marks
matching the vehicle the robbers
set fire today.
And even a tire print of
the get-away car.
Good job.
I'll pick up Dávod's colleagues
for questioning.
Plus Wagner's buddies, and Rydell.
- We must know if you get anything?
- Yes, of course.
Nothing more we can do now
except to go home
And hug our loved ones
and then come back at 12 tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
- Damn, this ...
- Yes, I know.
I must have my car.
I dropped the girls at the
kindergarten, hugs to you.
- Hey, guys.
- Talk to you then do.
This is Helen, Johan,
Nina's and Ola's voice mail.
leave a message.
Hey, it's me.
I just ... I miss you.
You may well ...
You can call me.
Back off!
Sit down. Sit.
- Sit.
- Calm down.
Calm.
I need help.
It wasn't me who killed Tommy.
Ok.
I am one of you.
I get a salary from the same place
as you. Do you understand?
We're here to help
do you put into the weapon.
I don't know if I can trust you.
Tommy trusted you.
He sent a picture of you
so I would recognize you.
One of us? Are you a snitch?
I'm not a fucking snitch.
I've worked for you for three years.
Tommy recruited me.
Hired me for my bar. He saw I knew
people. Everyone was there then.
They do like me.
In the beginning, it was about information
about who knew whom
Who worked with whom and who did what.
But after a while I was
asked to get involved.
When I asked Tommy and ...
He thought we'd run with it.
And then it expanded.
And now we are here.
- So I'm not a criminal.
- Well, well ...
You don't believe me.
The only one who can prove it
lies in the morgue.
If you give yourself up, we
can sort this out.
The only thing that can free me
is to disclose I work for you
And then I'll get killed.
But I will surely,
sooner or later.
I'm not going to bid on that authority
leave me sitting in this seat
That delivers my death warrant
because you can't handle the situation.
- Why do you come to me?
- Tommy trusted you.
He was paranoid,
but he trusted you.
As Tommy trust you what
could I do?
You would take over.
Summarize what?
What we are doing.
You and Tommy?
He wanted you
as an assistant manager.
As my second point of contact.
He said he thought ...
I notice that
I can't trust you ...
What happens then?
Yes, when you kill me.
Answer if you want.
I saw you called.
We were out for hamburgers.
Was it something?
I saw an interesting house on Hemnet.
Viewing in three weeks. We will do it then.
- What is it?
- There's nothing.
Nina wanted to talk to you.
Hi, Johan.
The exam went great. Fun, huh?
- Yes, what a good thing.
- Right?
Here Ola.
- Hello.
- Hi.
I have eaten ten burgers
and two fries.
I was a bit hard to talk right now.
I'll call you later.
- Guess what film I saw today.
- Ill hang up now. Bye.
I've had it like this for three years.
I don't know if it's worth it.
All I know, my mom, thinks
That I'm a serious criminal.
It says so in the newspapers
quoting police reports.
Don't believe everything
written in police reports.
Why not?
Huh?
The elevator is so ...
... I put two bullets
in Tommy's chest.
I had a 22 and I know he has a
vest when he is out on operation.
Then I put four bullets
the wall above the girl's head.
High above.
All bullets you'll find are
located in the ceiling.
I didn't know what to do.
Who is the other one?
Him with the beard.
I have a picture of him.
It is for you.
I gave it to Tommy.
I took this on the sly.
I can send it to you.
I got your number from Tommy.
He's called Exeter,
but I don't know his name.
He's the leader of "the six unknown".
- How do you know he's the leader?
- We've been working on it for over a year.
Ever since the first robbery.
You and Tommy?
Eric Dávod, who you grabbed yesterday
with heroin ...
He has repeatedly
ordered the cars from my gang.
Before we delivered the cars
I gave the tire patterns to Tommy.
Then he compared and found
the same cars used in the robbery.
When you grabbed Dávod the robbers
needed somebody new to get cars from.
It isn't easy with today's cars.
You have to have keys and ...
So they contacted us directly.
We met at the hotel to
discuss how we could continue.
I just had time to give Tommy
details before.
In the last seconds
they ordered an AK47 also.
It's good to get it off the street.
I get 5,000 to supply it.
He is.
Ok.
Hello?
Yes.
Ok.
No, no, yes.
Ok, good.
- He wants to meet now.
- Now?
He has a bit panic. They were not
with him any money previously
So now he wants to get started
Having someone Plan B.
- He ordered four cars directly.
- Plan B?
A new cash.
Please wait ... When? Where?
As soon as I know, you know.
You can tell your colleagues
it's from "Lisa".
Hello.
- Here they are.
- What is it?
They belongs to one of the suspects.
I found them on the back.
This will be a priority, huh?
For them to match the lethal bullet?
Well, of course.
It is Anja.
I just saw Chris Amir leave
police station. Isn't he in custody?
The court didn't agree to it.
I don't understand them.
There is nothing on him.
He just sat at the cafe.
Dávod had a half kilogram of heroin.
- And the buyer? Do you know who it was?
- No. Nothing new.
Ok, thanks. See you.
What the hell?
Hello.
You and I need to talk.
Come in.
You may wait a bit.
Hello.
- This is Johan.
- Hello. Nadja.
I try to plan activities so
they don't clash with evenings at home.
But today it's a little different.
We never took the buyer of the
drugs, right?
We took only the seller and the intermediary
who was just released for lack of evidence.
We never took the buyer because
there never was anybody.
Everything was a fake scenario
to bring Dávod in.
The intermediary Amir was on your side.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
But I would argue the reason
for GSI's unique success is
That you use
operational informants.
Or?
No, no. You don't answer.
Ok, then hypothetically.
One, at least one
of these individuals
is sanctioned by you
in the use of violence.
He makes a career in the underworld
so you gain valuable information.
"Rumours in Town"
as Tommy called it.
Hypothetically, it's a tempting idea
to have people out there.
Fake chess pieces who are active
and not just ordinary snitches.
They help us to inflitrate into
organized crime
Which is the responsibility
we got assigned by management.
Would it be so, hypothetically,
Hell you would never
disclose which pieces are false.
So who picked up Dávod
and Amir knew nothing?
In passing, they're told by the head
of GSI, Amir killed a policeman
So they are extra heavy-handed
when they make an arrest.
And no one suspects anything.
A slap to the jaw, knocked out
a tooth and he just smiles.
And his reputation as a hardened
criminal grows further.
Is that so?
Or?
What the hell, come on now.
You ...
You can talk to me.
If I'm to cooperate
you have to talk to me.
It normally takes several months
Before I entrust a new GSI member
with our operational practices.
- With Dick and Lasse took it a year.
- Do they know Amir?
It is Sophie, right, his manager?
It's like the military, Johan.
Need to know, not nice to know.
As so for all authorities.
Not just the police.
Dick and Lasse might guess.
But you never say what you think
and certainly not what you know.
You do the job
and trust your colleagues.
Safety is everything.
How do you feel
or some of the others about
The identity of codename "Lisa"?
Howdy.
What is it?
Ok actually.
They released you out directly?
They took up half the town,
but most are out.
You look a bit tired. Come on.
Is something wrong with the jaw?
You were careful
when you drove here, huh?
I talked with the Dane.
He can get you on the freighter.
No.
I'll just take it easy here.
I have met them again now.
Or the leader.
They wanted to dump us now.
Because I'm hot.
But I told him it is
my problem how I feel like.
It is because of his order
as I sit in the muck
So I demanded we get 10 %
of money they make on the robbery.
Plus the usual amount for the cars.
And of the ten, I'll take five.
What is it?
We have major problems since
you shot a policeman.
We really have to thank the police for
what we found out there.
We've been in jail all of us.
I sat there for twelve years,
our president's been in for ten years.
But you haven't spent a minute.
Yet, you get half the profits?
That you spent longer than Seth
proves well
That it requires a little intelligence
to stay out.
It's pretty stupid
to go to prison.
Good, then it's all here.
When we do what we came for.
One shouldn't pee on my back
and then pretend it's raining.
Right?
Pick him up!
He has been involved in recovery
alongside us.
He wakes up! Hold him, dammit!
- How did you find out?
- The Interrogator.
From the questions I got that piece of
shit continued to run his own business.
Although I warned him twice.
Is it so damn hard to die?
Yes, the shovels are out there.
There is nothing you need help?
Some broad we can help you from?
Cut off tattoos
Before burying the bastard.
He doesn't belong to us anymore.
Yes, what a good thing.
Then we start work.
What were you saying, Frank?
You had hit the guy, you say.
Yes. We will leave the cars
this morning.
There are four cars to be provided
exactly six in the morning.
Someone may take my new one out there,
it is better for me to stay low.
I have three keys left in depot,
so we can call the old man at the shop.
The addresse is ...
Check the registration number.
I heard you talk.
You are too much a gangster, bye.
Too little a businessman.
Frank doesn't take half.
He gives us half.
It is thanks to him
that the deal happen.
Are you in?
Youll get paid from the share of that
shit you got rid of.
- Good night. I go to bed.
- Good night, sweetheart. Sleep well.
Good night.
In our next chief
Lennart Jäger's safe
Is an envelope
for each handler.
So that we can continue working
If something happens to a handler.
Right after that ...
... After the shooting of the day
I followed Jäger Power
in his office
When he picked up
Tommy's envelope.
In each envelope like this, there is
further sealed small envelope.
One for each informant.
Tommy had a great deal.
Most common little snitch.
But then he had a
has been exceptionally good.
Lisa.
When we opened the envelope, Lisa
to ensure the identity, so ...
Yes, please.
Talk about protecting their informant.
Maybe he didn't trust
the police force.
Lisa contacted me today.
And Lisa says
Frank Wagner is innocent.
The leader of the robbery
killed Tommy.
The fact Wagner deliberately fired
into the wall, ceiling and Tommy's vest.
Do you think of Lisa?
Maybe. Yes.
We still have no choice.
Frank Wagner is wanted.
If we see him we have to arrest him.
Otherwise his criminal
friends will think, it's odd.
Lisa said something
about assistant manager?
Assistant?
- Does he have one of those?
- No. That's the problem.
- It's me.
- Two things.
We fix the cars at night. I have
prepared so you can find them.
- How?
- With a GPS tracker. I'll call later.
Wait, you said two things.
The ... they killed a guy just.
in the aisle.
It was an internal thing.
So you need not bother about
Jens Wickman any more.
- Who?
- Who did it? Everyone.
Not me, but ... You can't
nail them for it anyway.
You can't even tell
anybody. Then I burned.
You can't even
take down his picture from the wall.
I'll call when they have cars.
He has set a GPS tracker
on one of the robbers get away cars.
Good.
It seems Lisa has
a new handler.
Should you want more coffee?
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Did I wake you?
- Do you think I can sleep?
It is quiet now.
Quiet?
I have a new contact person.
You never had time to talk to Tommy,
do you? About to jump in?
It may be located
to do so with the new.
I don't know.
What then, don't know?
You are a bartender. You are neither
criminal or James Bond.
It is totally sick, but ... Wait.
I'll call you later.
- Hello?
- Are you alone in the house?
Yes. How the hell did you know?
When do I get into.
It is damn unprofessional of you
to come here.
Listen to me now.
I set up the rules, not you.
You do not know who may ...
Can I trust you? I have just
your word that you don't shoot Tommy.
And now Wickman.
Huh?
Was it here he was murdered?
Yes.
Ok.
And body?
- Buried.
- Damn!
How the hell did you know I was here?
What the hell do you think?
Your mobile was the only one
switched on throughout the area.
There aren't even neighbors.
I had the phone on
so I could call you.
Give me the names
so we put them there.
- You can't nail them for it.
- Why not?
- Then you burn me!
- We will protect you.
You can't protect ...
I won't end up in a foreign
country or a suburb.
Why are you doing then? Money?
I lose money on this.
So why?
When we know each other a bit better
I might tell it.
We grabbed Eric Dávod course
last night with 500 gm of heroin.
But shortly before it was split up
at the club where he's the bouncer.
Tommy didn't want you
pushing Dávod so hard
That he felt compelled
to sell the whole lot at once?
You aren't fucking stupid.
We will pick up Seth and the rest.
But not for this.
Let's take down these robbers.
You have to be here now.
Ok.
Hello.
Johan, you have found the weapons
from yesterday ...
Forensics found two bullets
in the middle of Tommy's vest.
And bullets
in the ceiling of the elevator.
But none of the bullets killed him.
They only hit in his vest.
Ok. Good. Thank you.
This is the one we suspect
the leader of "the six unknown".
Images aren't official.
Johan.
We have a GPS tracker
on one of the cars-
we think they'll use
as get away cars.
Does anyone recognize this cuckoo?
He's no one I've had to watch.
GPS has started to move now.
First there was this on E45,
but just turned off.
Eastbound.
It's me.
The cars have started to roll now.
Count on it happening today.
Otherwise they wouldn't charge the cars.
Are you sure
the beard is Swedish?
- Why do you ask?
- We don't recognize him.
I don't believe someone
appears out of nowhere.
It's damn true. He ...
He has a slight accent.
As some have pimples.
A bit like that around.
Good.
He breaks on anything
which can be Finnish.
So either he thinks, Estonian ...
Or Hungarian.
I can wipe away the environment
around the image.
So no one can figure out when
and each picture is taken.
How can we protect the source.
Send it to Europol.
Then you can link it to me?
Now the shit has stopped.
Call your Euro buddies on the road,
if you prefer.
Major road goes on the other side.
They have set the cars
with the rear facing the water.
What does it mean?
- It's me.
- I have to break for five seconds.
Do you know if the robbers should
get over something streams?
I'll check it.
Howdy. What's up?
- You have not heard?
- What?
Your mother's had a heart attack.
Huh?
How the hell do you know?
Victor's mom works at Sahlgrenska.
- Give me your keys.
- What?
- Give me your car keys.
- You feel like, damn.
don't do anything stupid now.
- Hello?
- Ove.
Frank.
- What about her?
- She is really bad.
- How bad?
- She got a hefty heart attack yesterday.
Christian and I am with her.
I have diverted
her number to my mobile.
I have to see her.
There you go.
But ... you understand
I have to arrest you.
Mm.
What?
I respect what you and Christian
are doing.
Come on, Frank.
We know where we have each other.
- Did you all right?
- Yes.
It wasn't that they suddenly
didn't want all the cars?
I stick to Stromstad with the
bitch. I'll call on Monday.
- Did we pay for everything?
- Yes.
They wondered if we couldn't
fix a speedboat in an hour.
little desperate, I think.
They probably have one as part of the plan,
but which can't be used.
We can't get a motorboat
in an hour. They've been checking the web
But those who had come home
tonight and the new isn't for sale.
- Cunt also ...
- What?
- he gets some of our percent.
- that's the way it is.
Ok. Thank you.
- Europol?
- No, it was Lisa.
They need a boat to flee on
the river to where the cars are.
So the robbery will happen
on the other side.
Now their boat messed up.
They can't find one in a hurry.
As we know in any case.
Dick. Ask coordination to check very
discreetly with security companies
The value of shipments
on the other hand for some hours.
Wait a minute. Patrik.
Since we have received information
the robbers
I assume we can send
information in the other direction.
We seized a speedboat that's
now at the police station.
A Buster XL with trailer and all.
My husband seized it
last week.
But we can't involve him.
What are you talking about?
We pick them out
and we'll do it here.
- What the hell?
- Why not.
It will count
as entrapment.
Everything we know tells us the robbers
will do this with or without our boat.
Either today when we can take them
Or another day when perhaps
we can't take them.
The boss can determine.
Ok. Carry on.
It is sanctioned.
- But, you ...
- Let's get started.
We have found a boat you can deliver.
A Buster XL with trailer and all.
- Within half an hour.
- You must help me, Johan.
Mom is at Sahlgrenska.
She is dying.
I have to see her.
My uncle and half brother are there.
They are police officers.
The deal is right now.
How can I help you?
Surely it can't be more difficult
than anything else in the GSI.
Ok, I'll figure out something.
But now you have to do this.
- What did you find?
- There is someone who wants to sell a boat.
- A Buster XL. It will be perfect.
- It sounds damn good.
I called him. He is waiting for you.
He wants 100,000 kr.
There is no problem.
I heard about your mom.
It's a bitch, huh?
- Ok. I'll call when we're done.
- Yes, we heard then.
Hey.
It was me who called about the boat.
Sure.
I discovered there is a full tank.
But you get it for free.
That is all.
The boat is delivered.
Wasn'y there a shooting range here?
It's still there.
We can practice sometime.
See if you can still paint the dots
after all the years in Europol.
- Have you ever finished?
- On what?
How to get me to the mother.
I'm sorry, but I can't
trick your uncle.
He's a colleague.
- She still asleep?
- Yes.
General call from 80
Ongoing armoured car
- at Landvetter. Shots have been fired.
Unknown if anyone is injured.
robbers have left
in a dark BMW driving west.
- Here we go.
- Yes.
- Falk.
- Have you heard anything about the robbery?
Just what is on the radio.
What do you know?
There is chaos at Landvetter.
Six robbers again.
This time they got money.
It is perhaps
of 50 million.
No exploding ink cartridges.
We need your help on the
confrontation. Where are you?
- We are actually in the vicinity.
- Where?
We are on the way to a shooting range.
It's great.
Hello.
- What did he say?
- They are on the range.
- Excuse me. Josephine Wagner?
- Room 8, straight ahead.
From 2001. Enough here. They may have
coverage on their own vehicle.
General call from 80 Then we have a
suspect in a dark BMW
which may be related
with the robbery at Landvetter.
Boråsvägen west near Rådasjön.
80-1930. We have found the getaway car
at Rådasjön, north side.
It is empty. It's ablaze.
The car burns
and a boat is leaving.
The robbers leaving in a boat in the
direction of south Rådasjön.
least four on board.
Where is the nearest bridge?
- 1930, repeat, over.
- We can't follow otherwise.
Hands up!
In there.
In!
Hold up your hand.
Mom.
There is so much
I should have told you.
I have a son.
His name is Donald.
And you have a daughter-in-law ...
... Named Marie.
She wanted to meet you all the time.
I should have told you.
Everything Ove and Christian said
and you read in the newspapers ...
Isn't so.
What the hell happens now?
Will they have backup cars? They have
four cars. We only have a gps.
If they go ashore where
is close to the motorway.
It takes us five minutes to go there.
Ok.
We are running!
Come on!
Two bags of each trunk.
Hurry up.
Quiet! Shut up!
Police! Drop your weapon!
Police!
Add your down!
It's me.
We have them now. All six.
Good.
Not everyone was so unknown.
Especially not one of your gang.
Your Vice President
Tage "tag" Westlund.
- Is it true?
- There was nothing you know?
I had said in that case.
Sometimes it's a bit difficult to know
who is your real brothers.
It was the last, huh?
The gentleman here is a little sore right arm.
Now it was in all cases, Europol.
He was Russian.
Born and raised in Estonia.
Intelligence Officer with Sweden
as a specialty. Hence the language.
But as my colleagues said:
The Russians, non-citizens,
are no longer desirable.
They get fired from their jobs.
And in Russia, they are not welcome.
They're considered as Estonians.
But this clown ...
We won't get him for a while.
Tjohej.
But you, how do we do with Lisa?
Tommy just said "Frank Wagner"
and then he died.
And it isn't a court.
We have found nothing at the hotel.
No fingerprints, no DNA.
And no surveillance cameras
nearby.
But wait a minute.
What do you mean?
The case is, to put it nicely,
solved by the police.
All these fine corporate citizen
know that Frank Wagner is a killer.
A Police killer even.
But no prosecutor can prove it.
Lisa will understand.
Check. Sure it was neat?
I call for peace over
Josephine Wagner's final resting place.
Give her, O Lord, your peace-
And let your eternal light
shine to her.
Amen.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for ...
You ... it was a damn lucky
the prosecutor didn't accuse you.
Frank.
The hospital where your guys, right?
That fucking bastard better
not say anything
It does not matter what jail
that little bitch goes to.
There are people in there
who'll get him.
The prosecutor claims Eric Dávod will
get twelve years in prison.
Life for the five surviving robbers
for the murder of the security guard.
My first day at work,
when you would take Dávod ...
You knew he was involved in the robbery,
but the investigation wasn't moving.
So you had Frank Wagner
out the squeeze on him
So he felt compelled
to get rid of his drugs
-To a buyer who didn't even exist.
We did it to move the
investigation forward.
Wasn't it so
you did it ...
... for the only person you knew
had anything to do with the robbery-
- Would be punished;
even if it were not for the robbery?
Hug your little son now,
see you on Monday morning.
Daddy!
