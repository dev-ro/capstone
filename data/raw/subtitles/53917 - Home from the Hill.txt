Coming over the left. More further.
Over further.
Behind you.
Who the hell did this to me?
- Cut him off.
- Are you bad off?
Well, I'm hit. I know that.
Cut him off. Hustle him over to the captain.
Come on, get in there.
Get up, you varmint.
Get up there and stand on your feet.
This here was what was out there
trying to pick you off, Captain Wade.
I don't believe I know you.
You know my wife. You stay away from her.
What do you want us to do with him, Wade?
You want to call the sheriff in on this?
What do you say, boy? What
am I gonna do with you?
I don't care what you do
with me. Stay away from Ellie.
Come on, kid.
Turn him loose.
If you've got troubles at home,
maybe that's where you ought to be.
Next time, I won't miss.
You ain't got one more shot in you, boy.
Before I bleed to death...
...I'd like a swallow of whiskey
and some medical attention.
No. Never mind.
Wade, I'm gonna tell you...
...how we small-town Texans
get our name for violence.
It's grown men like you
still playing guns and cars.
You never will grow up, will you?
It's getting to where a man isn't a man
anymore unless he uses up a car a year...
...goes down the road at 100 miles an hour...
...owns six or seven fancy shotguns,
knows six or seven fancy ladies.
How long is it gonna be
before I can use this arm?
You just be thankful that you still got it.
This sporting life's
gonna do you in yet, hear?
- That's possible.
- That's for sure.
Here.
It's open season on you as long as you
go poaching on the preserves of love.
That is the way it happened, isn't it?
I take it as my right to cross
any man's fences when I'm hunting.
Game, yes, but women, no.
Your job is just to bandage
me up, Reuben, not to preach.
I believe I know my job, captain.
In case anybody wants to bring it
up, this was a hunting accident.
Nobody's gonna hear
anything different from me.
I'm a friend of your wife,
remember? A good friend.
Light me a cigarette.
And drive slow. I'm in no hurry to get home.
That young hothead that was laying
for me this morning, you know him?
- I see him around.
- What's his story?
- He loves his wife.
- Well, I gathered that.
I'll tell you something...
...I can't even remember which one she was.
Well, he's only got one woman, so he
has no trouble keeping them straight.
Well, you think that gives him
the right to take a shot at me?
I would have.
That reminds me, I haven't
gotten around to thanking you.
Sir?
I'm in the prime of life.
I'm anxious to stay that way.
If it hadn't been for you, I'd be cold
meat right now in the back of this truck.
Well, as long as you're
so glad to be alive...
...such a generous frame of
mind, I wouldn't say no...
...if you gave me that double-barreled,
12- gauge bird gun you keep locked up.
I'm not paying you for my life,
Rafe, I'm just thanking you for it.
What you don't ask for in this
world, captain, you don't get.
Look, I take care of you. Good care.
You get seed. You got liquor, tobacco.
You hunt my woods, you fish my streams.
You own a change of clothes, live
rent-free. Got steady employment.
You wanna improve your station in
life, you can just move on any time.
No, sir. I go where you go.
Well, then don't press, Rafe.
You pick me up here at 6:00 in the morning.
- Right.
- And you be on time, hear?
Hey, Chauncey?
Chauncey.
Melba?
Chauncey!
Melba!
Is there anybody in this house?
I'm here.
You need some help, Wade?
Yes, I need some help, Wade, if
you can stand the sight of blood.
Oh, it doesn't bother me.
Hannah, you're a cool one.
I could walk in here with my head under
my arm and you wouldn't turn a hair.
You look a little pale, Wade.
Would you like some whiskey?
I've had some whiskey, Hannah. Lot of it.
Is there something you
want me to do for you, Wade?
Yes, there's something I'd
like you to do for me, dear.
You might offer me a kind word.
I'm very sorry you were hurt.
Well, I guess that will
have to do for the moment.
Now, come on over here and
cut me out of this shirt.
- Let me tell you about this little accident.
- I've already heard.
News travels fast in this town.
I've had three telephone calls about it.
Who was it couldn't wait to call?
The one said she was a friend...
...and two were anonymous.
What kind of scum would
call up to spread dirt...
...and not even have the
guts to say who they were?
They've called before.
All right, Hannah, here's my version.
I kicked Ben Ramsay's shotgun
getting out of the truck...
...and it went off in my face.
You're not about to
believe that story, are you?
Some day, some husband's gonna kill you.
Well, that shouldn't
cause you too much concern.
I'm heavily insured.
When it happens, what am
I supposed to tell my son?
That you were caught in
some out-of-the-way hotel...
...or climbing into
somebody's back bedroom...
...in the dead of night
with your shoes in your hand?
Or that some poor young boy,
married three months, shot at you?
You might tell him I'd have stayed at home...
...if there was anything
at all to stay home for.
Theron's only 17 years old.
We won't tell him anything, Wade.
Hey, ain't that the captain's boy?
Captain's boy nothing, that's Hannah's boy.
Getting old for apron strings, ain't he?
I don't know how old he is, but
that kid sure is mossy green.
You can send him after pigeon's milk
or a left-handed monkey wrench, he'd go.
I bet we could even get that
kid to go on a snipe hunt.
He doesn't even know there's no
such thing as snipe hunting at night?
No, he don't. I show you.
Evening, Theron.
Good evening, Mr. Gibbons. Mr. Macauley.
Mr. Bradley, Mr. Stiles,
Mr. Skaggs, Mr. Dinwoodie.
You kicking around town all
alone on a Saturday night?
Where's your girlfriend?
Oh, maybe he's got more than one
girl and just can't make up his mind.
Ain't that right, Theron? Sit down.
- Well, you sure?
- Oh, come on, Theron, sit down.
Well, thank you.
You know, this is a mighty
nice night for a snipe hunt.
- Yeah, it is at that.
- It is snipe weather, all right.
Oh, they like it when it's balmy like this.
Yeah, this is the mating season
and they'll be out there in droves.
What do you say, you boys
interested in snipe hunting?
Yeah, I ain't been snipe hunting in years.
- I'm game. Let's go.
- I was hoping you'd ask me.
Hold on, Peyton, there's five already
and the tires on my truck ain't so-
Oh, come on, Hugh. One more ain't gonna hurt.
Well, all right, but no more.
Tarnation, tarnation, I can't go. I
forgot I promised to drop in on Louella.
- You don't suppose-
- What's that, son?
Oh, nothing.
I was gonna ask if you'd
mind if I came along.
I'd just watch and I'd keep
out of the way, because-
But you ain't never had hunting
experience, now, have you, son?
- Well, no sir, but I- -
Well, there you are. Sorry.
Now, just a minute, Hugh...
...you had to get a start yourself
once. Don't be hard on the boy.
Remember, the captain's the best
hunter we got in these parts.
- He is that.
- He's the man...
...that killed the last
wild boar in northeast Texas.
Oh, I know that.
And the fruit don't fall
too far from the tree.
All right, but if anything
goes wrong, it's your fault.
Remember, I was against it.
Come on, Theron, pay no attention to him.
We're glad to have you with us.
- Glad to have you with us.
- All aboard.
Come on, boy.
This looks like a good place.
They'll be coming down
here to the pond to feed.
- Who's gonna be the catcher?
- Why not Theron?
Make Theron the catcher?
Are you out of your minds?
You see, I haven't had much experience-
Oh, come on, Hugh. Let's let Theron catch.
Sure, there's gotta be a first time, Hugh.
All right, but I hope
you don't ruin everything.
- No, sir. I'll do my very best.
- Come on, Theron. Be very quiet.
Right there by the stump.
That's a good place there.
Right there.
Now, get down there and
hold this sack wide open.
They'll come when they hear you
whistle. Hugh, where's the whistle?
Oh, thank you, Mr. Macauley.
Now, you keep blowing this
whistle real soft, like this:
We're gonna go through the
bushes and drive them towards you.
Everybody get a stick.
- Soft. - I'm
sorry, I didn't mean-
- Understand?
- Yes, oh, yes.
Be quiet.
You two best be quiet.
Two hours.
Most of them catch on they've
been had in about 15 minutes.
Think we ought to go back and end it?
Yeah, the joke's over.
- Evening, men.
- Evening, Wade.
- Hi, Wade.
- Captain.
Have any of y'all seen my
boy? He didn't come home.
His mama's worried.
He's out at Miller's Pond, Wade.
- What's he doing there?
- Well, maybe we'd better show you.
Catching any?
Looks like you're the victim
of a little local humor, son.
I guess this makes me out to
be a real jackass, doesn't it?
Well, you're not the first one.
I was taken on one of
these things once myself.
Come on, boy, let's go home.
You're feeling a little raw, aren't you?
Any 10-year-old kid would
have seen through that...
...but I bought it.
Yeah, that's right. You were taken...
...good and proper.
How did I look to you, sitting
out there, holding a bag...
...whistling like some kind of an idiot bird?
You looked to me like you
needed to learn a thing or two.
Well, you're my father.
How come I wasn't taught?
I would have taken you
in tow a long time ago...
...but I promised your mother
something the day you were born.
What, that you'd keep me in short
pants for the rest of my life?
Something like that.
This is a boy's room.
Come on downstairs, I'll
show you how a man lives.
I had something from my father
that his father gave to him.
I'm gonna give it to you. It's
late but it's not too late.
You know, one of these
days I'm gonna die, Theron.
You're gonna come into 40,000 acres of land.
Cotton, beef, goats, timber.
Takes a special kind of man to handle that.
Kind of man that walks around
with nothing in his pockets.
No identification because
everybody knows who you are.
No cash because anybody in town would
be happy to lend you anything you need.
No keys because you don't keep
a lock on a single thing you own.
And no watch because time waits on you.
What I'm saying is you're gonna
have to stand up and be counted.
You're gonna be known in these
parts as a man or as a mama's boy.
There's never gonna be
another night like tonight.
All right. Now, you can take those
rocks and butterflies and stamps...
...whatever toys you've been occupying
yourself with. Throw them in the ash can.
Because from now on, you're
gonna learn in the woods.
I'm not sending you out for game.
I'm not asking you to go on out
and bring meat home for the table.
What I'm talking about is coming
face to face with your own courage...
...your own cunning, your own endurance.
Because what every man
hunts out there is himself.
- If that's what you want, I'll help you.
- You just show me how.
Don't be so quick to answer.
Take a look around this room.
You know, some of these animals
put up a fight before they die.
A good fight.
That's what you're gonna have to
come up against one of these days.
I said yes.
All right. Go on over to that
cabinet and pull out a gun.
You're holding a Winchester
Model 94, 30-30 carbine.
It's loaded.
In order to put a shell in
the chamber, use the lever.
The safety catch is the first click
on the hammer. Put it on safety.
All right, now pull the
hammer all the way back.
Now you're ready to fire.
Aim in that fireplace.
You gonna have me shoot
this gun off in the house?
It's a big fireplace, Theron.
Don't you think you can hit it?
Now lay your cheek snug up against the stock.
Both eyes wide open.
Take a deep breath.
Let out half of it.
Now slowly squeeze down on the trigger.
Miss Hannah, what is it?
Quiet!
He's gonna be a good shot, Hannah.
Theron, would you go to bed, please?
- Good night, son.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, son.
He's a nice boy, Hannah.
A decent boy.
Good manners, soft-spoken,
fine personal appearance.
You've done a good job, as far as it goes.
But I take it you're not satisfied.
No, my dear, I'm not.
What else do you want him to be?
My son.
You said you'd never interfere with him.
You said you'd never touch him.
You gonna hold me to
some damn fool promise...
...that I made to you
on the night he was born?
- Forget it.
- You said he was mine if I stayed.
Well, I stayed.
Behind a locked door.
I remained in this house.
He belongs to me. I had your word of honor.
Well, I changed my mind. You've had
him for 17 years. Now I want him.
I'll wipe the egg off his face,
take him out in the company of men.
Whether you like it or not, Hannah,
that boy's gonna come of age.
- You can't have him.
- You can't stop me.
I'll tell you what you do, Hannah.
Why don't you join a garden club...
...get you some outside interests?
From here on out, that boy is mine.
Well, mighty hunter...
...it's not gonna be easy.
He's got a mind of his own. I gave him that.
Don't think he'll come to heel
like one of your hunting dogs...
...at the snap of your fingers.
Now, you're gonna learn
from the woods, Theron.
You're gonna listen to the hounds run a fox.
You're gonna have your own
gun, shoot over fine bird dogs.
You'll learn to read animal
signs and tell them the weather.
Rafe here is kind of an educated
man, in his own way. He'll teach you.
You want me to be a sort of
a big brother to him, captain?
That's right.
Well, sonny, it looks like I'm taking you on.
- Well, that's fine with me, Rafe.
- Yeah.
If you can manage to do something right,
I'll see to it that you get a brownie.
What's that?
Marsh gas.
That's where Sulphur Bottom begins.
You ever been in there?
You walk in there, you'll never walk out.
Nine out of 10, Rafe.
Ten out of 10 is better.
Now!
Now!
Now.
That's all for today, sonny.
We're all out of bottles.
Now!
Will you kindly wait until they're empty?
- Is this ever gonna work?
- Just rattle away, sonny.
Doesn't sound like two bucks fighting to me.
We're not trying to convince you. It's
those four-legged creatures out there.
Boy, do you know it's raining?
Do you know what I
customarily do on a rainy day?
- What?
- Stay dry.
I don't think I'm reaching
you. Let me put it another way.
Let's go home.
This is Saturday night.
Now, that's the night I
take a bath and shave...
...and station myself down at the
square and watch the girls go by.
What girls?
You're not interested in
girls, you can't shoot them.
Come on, what girls?
The pretty, dainty ones.
The one's that got doe eyes.
- You talk to them?
- Oh, certainly, I talk to them.
Sweet and low.
I can't swallow my own
spit when I'm around a girl.
Is that so?
I tell you what I'm prepared to do.
You get down out of this
tree, come into town with me...
...and I'll show you a
different kind of hunting.
Quit trying to con me, will you, Rafe? As
long as it's daylight, I'm staying here.
- Here he is.
- Well, at last.
Melba, the truck's full of quail.
We're gonna be eating good all summer.
You've already shot up enough
of God's living creatures.
I wish you'd leave off and come through
that door looking like a gentleman.
Once upon a time, you
were a nice-looking boy.
- Now, now, Melba.
- What's for supper?
You gonna have a piece of your father's mind.
- His plate went down 40 minutes ago.
- It's all right. It's all right.
I guess I'm a little late.
I believe I see the beginnings
of a beard on you, Theron.
Yes, sir.
Well, it's been duly noted.
After this, you shave before
you come to your mother's table.
I had an interesting little bill from
the gun-and-tackle shop this morning.
It seems they've been enjoying your
patronage to the tune of $68.40.
No, sir, I've been trying to keep it
down. I came in with 61 quail tonight.
I used exactly three boxes.
That's only 75 shells.
I know how many shells
there are in a box, Theron.
I also know how many
hours there are in a day.
Now, where are you finding all
this time to shoot up the woods?
Well, I guess I've been taking
off from school a little bit.
How's that?
I guess I've been taking off
some time from school, sir.
- You have, huh?
- Yes, sir.
Aren't Saturdays and Sundays enough for you?
No, sir.
I know how important hunting
is to a boy your age, Theron.
But don't neglect your schooling.
That's gonna unlock a lot of
doors for you. It's important.
His happiness is important too, Wade.
That's why I told Mr. Graves he wouldn't
be coming back to school at all anymore.
You told him what?
Well, that Theron would be
leaving school permanently.
Hannah, Theron has two
parents. I'm one of them.
Well, I can't always find you
when I want to consult you, Wade.
Well, I'm here now and I'm against it.
But why? Gentlemen in these
parts are hunters, aren't they?
He's Captain Hunnicutt's boy.
Why should he go to school with every till
- keeper's son...
...and learn arithmetic to count pennies?
Because I want my son to
be a better man than I am.
I don't want him to make
the same mistakes I have.
I'm sorry you feel that way about it, Wade.
I was so sure this was
what you wanted for him.
No, Hannah.
You were so sure that Theron would
be very grateful to his mother...
...for letting him have his own way.
Well, I don't know.
Maybe he will remember it was my doing.
Maybe he will be grateful. I
don't know. Will you, Theron?
I was going to quit, anyway.
You see, when all is said and
done, neither one of us has any say.
He certainly does have a
mind of his own, doesn't he?
Captain, the kitchen is full of
men. They'd like to speak with you.
- Who is out there?
- Seems like they're all your tenant people.
Never mind. Chauncey, have them come in here.
- I'm going up to my room.
- Yes, ma'am.
Good night, son.
Oh, I see.
No more syrupy sentimentality.
Just rough friendliness.
All right.
Come on in, gentlemen.
Come on, pull up some chairs.
Chauncey, bring us five
cups of coffee, please.
Well, men?
Well, Hugh here was the first.
Go on, Hugh. Tell him.
Well, it was more than a week ago.
There was that young
tom turkey I was raising.
I thought he was stole. That
is, until I saw them tracks.
Three days ago I found a
carcass of a fox and two coons.
Lots of tracks and the ground all chewed up.
I came out yesterday and
there was my chicken coop...
...all busted up.
A pig dead and eaten, turnip patch
all rooted out and tracks everywhere.
It's a wild boar, captain. Sure enough.
One that hadn't ever been anything but wild.
- Probably worked his way from Louisiana.
- I saw him this morning.
He's a big red. Solid red all over.
Smells just like burnt flesh and feathers.
And he's mad. Covered all over
with little drops of blood...
...oozing out of every pore instead of sweat.
What with all them gnats and flies a
- buzzing over him.
I tell you, captain, he
looks half crazy to me.
I don't doubt he'll run as big as that one...
...you got hanging over your mantel, captain.
You're the landlord, Wade.
We just rent from you.
Your responsibility.
Well...
...I reckon I'm gonna have to find
somebody to take care of him for you.
I've already had the fun and
sport of one of them myself.
I believe I'll turn this one over to my son.
He wants to flex his muscles.
Oh, captain, remember, it was
only a couple of months ago...
...why, we couldn't even get
Theron here to catch a snipe for us.
Well, wild boar's more his dish.
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.
All right.
When the dogs start running,
he'll head for the thicket.
He'll likely run downhill, instead
of up. He'll try to get into a swamp.
Now, there's one thing I wanna
make absolutely clear to you.
If he heads down towards Sulphur Bottom...
...you give up the hunt.
No man's ever come out
of those quicksands alive.
The dogs aren't gonna be able
to head him in your direction.
You'll just have to follow
along the best you can.
After a while, he's gonna turn around
and take the dogs on in a fight.
You'll be able to tell when that
happens by the difference in the sound.
They'll sound kind of scared.
You know, over in Louisiana, they
hunt these things with 15 hounds.
You've only got three of them. None
of them ever hunted boar before.
When he does make a stand,
I'd appreciate it if you'd...
...try to get there before
he kills all three dogs.
Now, remember, he's gonna be in thick cover.
You're not gonna be able to see
him until you get really close.
That is, until he gets close to you.
The minute he sees you, he'll charge you.
He'll rip right through
those dogs to get at you.
By the look of him and the size of
him, you'd think he's bound to be slow.
Don't you believe it.
He's one of the fastest things that moves.
Don't aim for the head, too thick.
Aim for the snout, you ought
to hit the heart. You listening?
Yes, sir.
Make that first shot count. Because
that's the last one you're likely to get.
One of those brutes can keep
going with a bullet in his heart...
...and still hit you hard enough to kill you.
And don't wait around to
see if that shot's good.
You stand close to a tree
with low branches on it.
Throw your rifle away and start
climbing the second you pull the trigger.
Now, is that clear?
Do you suppose he'll be a big one?
Do you suppose he'll be as big as this one?
He'll be big enough.
- Good morning, Rafe.
- Morning, all.
- What's he doing here?
- He's going with you.
What for? I don't need him.
Why does he have to come along?
I want somebody to back you up.
Don't worry, you're gonna do all the killing.
Suits me.
All right, it's nearly
sunup. Come on, get going.
Is he gone?
Yeah, he's gone.
It's gonna be one hell of a long day for me.
Well, I'll start you off
with strong black coffee.
Yeah.
Yeah, they've got the scent.
- Look at this ground.
- He's been here.
I don't hear the dogs.
Chest ripped from throat
to belly, deep as my hand.
Too much for you, sonny?
- Is he dead?
- No, not yet.
But he will be.
Not hurt, not a scratch on him anywhere.
Not even afraid.
He just wore out.
Call Deuteronomy in, that's enough for today.
Go on, call him. Your
pig will be here tomorrow.
- You smoke yet?
- No thanks.
Tried it once, thought it would kill me.
It's a dirty, filthy habit.
Something bothering you, sonny?
Suppose you get the first shot.
Suppose you bring him down.
I'll tell you something, sonny.
I already made the first team.
Some years back, when you were still
wearing your pants three-cornered...
...I was out in the deep woods
with a rifle bigger than I was.
I brought down a 15-point buck.
And old Chauncey cut that deer's throat...
...and dipped his fingers
in the warm blood...
...and made a mark on my forehead.
Now, nothing that happens tomorrow...
...could be any better than that.
So all the danger...
...and all the glory...
...are gonna be yours, sonny.
Still, people are gonna say you were there...
...in case I got in any trouble.
No...
...the captain don't listen to people.
He'll know who done it.
Get some sleep, killer.
- Where is he?
- Captain, what are you doing out here?
- I couldn't wait. Where's Theron?
- I don't know.
You mean you let that
boy take off on his own?
I didn't let him anything. He just took.
Did you climb the tree?
No, sir.
No, when I told you, I knew you wouldn't.
Your mouth dry?
- Tastes kind of like brass, doesn't it?
- How did you know that?
Well, I guess every man's tasted it
at one time or another. That's fear.
Here. Go on. Suck on it.
How's Deuteronomy?
He'll be all right.
Here's a trophy for you, sonny.
You can wear it behind your ear.
Go around the block again.
I've been around three times.
I'm not ready yet.
All you're gonna do is ask a girl to a dance.
I know it. I'm just trying
to think what to say.
Start off with hello.
See what she says to that.
She'll say hello right
back, and then where am I?
Well, you're face to face, for one thing,
which is a lot more than you are now.
What if she says she's got a date already?
That's very simple.
Then you kill yourself.
I could call her up, but my voice
sounds lousy on the telephone.
Kind of high-pitched.
Go ring the doorbell, will you, please?
I need a haircut pretty bad.
If I were you, I'd leave it long.
That way, nobody's going to know
how wet you are behind the ears.
I can't do it, Rafe.
All right, let's go
home. Try again next year.
Oh, wait a minute. Maybe
you could do it for me.
Are you kidding?
- I'd sure appreciate it.
- No, sir.
Come on, Rafe, be a good guy.
I should ask some girl I've
never laid eyes on before...
...if she'd care to hold
hands with Theron Hunnicutt?
Well, I'll do you a favor someday.
Well, I've baited a lot
of hooks in my time...
...but I usually eat the fish myself.
Have you got your new shoes on?
Well, let me see you walk in them.
Hurry up, now. I want those shoes
broken in before school takes up.
Why do I have to wear those
shoes to school, anyway?
- They don't make me any smarter.
- Well, we could always hope.
Walk.
- You're missing a spot up on the top.
- Oh, I didn't hear anybody come up.
It's right up there in the middle.
I can't reach it, so I'm ignoring it.
I'm Rafe Copley...
...and I got a nervous young
friend named Theron Hunnicutt...
...who sent me to talk to you.
He wants to know if you'd...
...care to go to a dance with him
over at the Hunnicutt house tonight.
Oh, this thing sure could use some wax.
He sent you to ask me to
go to a dance with him?
Yeah.
It's kind of unusual, isn't it?
Well, it's the most unusual
thing I ever heard of.
If he wants a date so much,
why didn't he come himself?
Well, I'll tell you.
He's a pretty shy boy, you know.
Well, I don't know what
he's got to be afraid of.
Neither do I. You're not
even bigger than he is.
Well, what do you say?
I say if you want a job done, do it yourself.
You're not gonna send me back
to tell that boy no, are you?
He's all worked up about this thing.
Means a whole lot to him.
I haven't said no, have I?
You haven't said yes, either.
Well, I've gotten as
far as maybe. How's that?
Well, no wonder it takes two men to
get a date with one tee-tiny girl.
I don't think you like your work, Mr. Copley.
It's uphill, I can tell you that.
Well, didn't he tell you to pay
me any compliments or anything?
Oh, yes, ma'am.
I'm supposed to put salt
on your tail, all right.
I'm listening.
That boy is very much taken with you.
He said to me, "Rafe, that's no
ordinary, run-of-the-mill girl.
A fellow doesn't have
to feed her any hogwash.
He can just be himself with her.
A trifle on the skinny side, but mighty good
- looking.
And I'm gonna get to
know her better or bust. "
Now, that's what he said to me.
I don't think so.
Theron never made that long
a speech in his whole life.
He wrote the music. I just
helped out with the words.
You sound to me like you've
had a lot of practice.
No, ma'am. First time I ever
stuck my neck in this noose.
You're very good at it.
So you can go tell Theron I'd be
happy to accept his invitation...
...thanks to you.
Next time I come around,
I'll be doing my own talking.
Swing your partner...
...and promenade.
Double it.
Center all.
And back.
Center all.
And back.
- Good evening, Mrs. Hunnicutt.
- Good evening.
Double it.
Center all.
And back.
Center all.
And back.
Here you are, Rafe.
What are you doing to us here?
No, thank you.
Hi, Darlene. How's everything?
Fine.
- Yes?
- Good evening, Mr. Halstead.
- Well, it's Theron Hunnicutt.
- I can see it is.
- I've come to take Libby to the dance, sir.
- Have you?
Oh, yes, sir. They're giving
me a little dance tonight.
I don't know how.
Libby's gonna have to teach me.
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.
What are you going to teach her?
Could you please tell her I'm here, sir?
Elizabeth can't go with you. She's sick.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
What's the matter with her?
I told you, she's sick!
- I hope it's nothing serious.
- No, it isn't.
Well, I'll call tomorrow to see how she is...
- ... and I'd like her to have these anyway.
- No!
Don't you call tomorrow. Don't you ever call!
I don't want your kind around here.
- Sir?
- It's plain English, isn't it?
Go on, go away!
Wait a minute. Why? What did I do?
Libby?
Libby.
Mr. Halstead.
Come and get it! Come get it!
Well, we've done ourselves
real proud tonight.
All our friends here to do honor to the boy.
- Where is he?
- Gone to pick up his girl.
I wish you'd seen him.
Hair all wet down.
You could smell that shaving
lotion from about 20 feet.
I didn't know he had a girlfriend.
Seventeen?
At 17, everybody's got a girl.
He doesn't know how to dance.
Well, he should have
come to his mama to learn.
You were a lovely dancer, Hannah.
My sister Alice and I were
the best in the county.
We used to have special
patent-leather shoes made up in Dallas.
When we didn't have any beaus,
we danced with each other.
- I did all the leading.
- Yeah, I know.
You used to push me around the floor.
One, two, three, slide. One, two
- You remember that?
- Guess I better go see to our guests.
- No, no. Wait a minute.
I just want to talk to you a minute.
Hannah...
...I'm a happy man.
I think we've got something
wonderful in that boy. Something...
Well, something very special.
You and me...
...together, we made a first-rate person.
Yes, I suppose we've been good for something.
You're a good-looking woman, Hannah.
I almost put a ribbon in my hair tonight.
I was upstairs dressing,
the window was open...
...I heard everybody laughing and talking.
You know, we should have more
parties. We ought to open our doors.
I like people to come to my
house and make them feel good.
You always did like parties.
I remember my graduation dance.
You stayed so late my father had
to throw you out of the house.
Yeah, but I came back the next day.
The day after that and the day
after that and all summer long.
And on Labor Day I called you and
said, "I love you," and hung up.
You called back.
That was a long time ago.
I still feel the same, Hannah.
What you feel is nostalgia and liquor.
No, no. This is what I feel.
You're too late, Wade...
...with too little.
Even when you freeze up on me, Hannah...
...you're still the most
beautiful, desirable-
- Of them all?
- All right, there have been others.
But you can put an end to that.
You just unlock your door.
Tonight, if you want to.
Right now, if you want to.
Then I'll tell you why you still find
me attractive after all these years.
Because you can't have me.
Because you never will.
Listen, the hunters are
first in this line tonight.
Now, come on. Where are all the hunters?
Hello, hunters.
Hello, Theron.
Hello, Libby.
Would it be all right if I came
in and talked to you for a minute?
Of course.
- Would you like to have a seat here?
- I wrote you a letter this morning.
Three pages.
Then I tore it up.
I decided it'd be better
if I saw you in person.
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.
The silly things, they never stay on.
Theron...
...I'd like to apologize to you
for what happened the other night.
Your father sure can't stand the sight of me.
He acted like I was contagious or something.
Well, he's an old-fashioned kind of man.
He thinks a boy just wants
one thing from a girl.
- He doesn't know anything about me.
- Well, I'm as stubborn as he is.
If you want to see me again, you can.
Oh, I wouldn't like anybody to see
me. I'm not supposed to be here.
Where
-?
Up here.
Let's go to the attic.
I haven't been up in this
attic in about a year.
I used to sneak up here all the time.
Read books my mother didn't want me to read.
- I used to go down to the basement.
- I bet they were the same books.
Probably.
I'm a real clod, Libby.
I don't think so.
Oh, yes, I am.
I shouldn't have sent Rafe
to get a date with you.
I should've had it out with your father,
instead of getting put off the porch...
...like I was a cat or something.
Don't worry about it, Theron.
My main trouble's I just haven't had
very much experience with girls...
...if you want to know the truth.
You see, I spent my whole childhood
collecting rocks and birds...
...and stuff like that.
That's why I act like such a
moron where women are concerned.
Oh, you're not a moron at all.
I think you're very mature.
Well, I'm a lousy conversationalist.
Well, you're having a conversation with me.
I don't mind talking to you.
I wouldn't mind telling you everything.
Of course, it'd probably bore your ears off.
Oh, no, it wouldn't.
Well, you see, I'm a very moody person...
...and one day I'll feel great and
the next day I'll feel so low...
...I can't stand myself.
I cry a lot, for no reason.
People say it's wonderful
to be young. Some wonderful.
We do have our whole lives ahead of us.
That's what they mean, I guess.
What are you gonna do with yours? I
mean, you got any plans or anything?
Oh, I suppose I'll get married like
everybody else, have a big family...
...and can peaches and make my own curtains.
I'll probably get fat
too. It runs in my family.
Oh, excuse me, Libby, but I think
you've got a very good figure.
Oh, I suppose a remark like that...
...would blow the top off your father's head.
Well, you can't expect
older people to understand.
It's getting dark outside.
I think it's gonna rain.
Libby...
...will you tell me something?
Didn't you wanna go out
with me the other night?
Oh, Theron, I was all dressed for the party.
I wanted very much to go with you.
Well, then why did he run me off like that?
Please, Theron, don't be hurt by that.
He awfully strict and old-fashioned.
That was the way he was brought
up. He really means well.
I know it. I just wanted to be with you.
I've been hoping to get to
know you for a long time.
Well, then, why didn't you do
something about it a whole lot sooner?
Scared to.
You've got every reason to be.
We're a terrible bunch.
You ought to hear us when
we sit around and talk.
Boys, boys, boys.
How to catch them, how to keep
them, how to hold on to them.
There aren't quite enough of
you to go around, you know.
Well, nobody's after me that I know of.
Look again.
I hope you mean that.
Well, I came up here, didn't I?
Well, maybe you were
just feeling sorry for me.
No, Theron, that wasn't the reason at all.
Libby, I think I love you.
You think you love me, do you?
I know I do.
This is going a little bit too fast.
Did I do something wrong?
Well, no, but it'd be easy
to if we stayed up here.
I know a safer place we could meet.
I go to the library every day around 4.
Okay, I can...
I see I'll be checking out
a lot of books from now on.
Watch where you're going.
Don't run over my Harry.
I'll watch it, ma'am. I'll watch it.
Going for a ride, ma'am.
Afternoon, ma'am.
Good afternoon, Rafe.
I didn't know you had anyone here.
Oh, everyone's got somebody, ma'am.
This one's mine.
Why, it's shameful, the way
they let this section run down.
Well, it's only Reprobate's Field.
Reprobate's Field.
They put the ones down here who
aren't fit to lie with the Christians.
There are plenty of those
on the high ground...
...belong by rights down here, don't they?
Wouldn't quarrel with that.
Why are they all so neglected and forgotten?
Maybe it would've been
better if they'd never lived.
That's not for us to say, is it?
It would've been better for this one.
Is there an inscription?
Oh, yes, ma'am, there's
an inscription, all right.
Not exactly "Rest in Peace"...
...and not exactly "Heaven is Your Home. "
It's short and right to the point.
"Cause of death: pneumonia.
" Signed, county coroner.
Is there a name?
Oh, they have to put down
a name. That's the law.
"Anne Copley. "
That's my mother, Miss Hunnicutt.
Maybe you remember her?
Yes.
Yes, I remember her.
I wouldn't say no to a cup
of coffee if it was offered.
Hi, Rafe.
I know you weren't expecting
company but you got it.
Help yourself.
I guess you know Libby.
- Miss Libby.
- Well, if it isn't the matchmaker.
Maybe I ought to take it up
as a regular line of work.
I'd recommend you.
You sure picked the right girl, Theron.
She can cook coffee.
Any more at home like you, Miss Libby?
Nope. I'm all there is.
And you're already spoken for.
That's right, Rafe.
Sonny, I do believe I
notice a change in you...
...over these last few weeks.
Well, it's the feminine touch, Rafe.
Yeah.
I hear tell it does wonders for growing boys.
You ought to try it yourself, Rafe.
There's not a woman in the
world who'd put up with me.
A man who sleeps with his boots on,
and drinks beer in the morning...
...and keeps a skunk for a house
pet is no fit company for a lady.
Isn't that right, Miss Libby?
Oh, some girl will take you in hand.
She'll get you to dry dishes
and pay life insurance...
...just like everybody else.
I can hardly wait.
Oh, yeah. One of these days, you'll
be taking the kids to the dentist...
...and mowing the lawn.
Don't you think you won't.
Is that what I got in store for me?
Very likely, if you hang around me much.
It's more fun than hunting.
Well...
...it's getting dark.
You two coming back to town?
I just think we'll sort
of stay behind a while.
All right then.
Good night to you.
Night.
You know what he's going to do?
He's gonna go on home and cook
supper and read those seed catalogs...
...and talk out loud to himself.
You can't knock around on your
own. You gotta have friends, family.
And someone to love you.
Don't you worry.
You've got someone to love you.
Someone tall and thin, with a sunburn?
Libby, I'm dying to kiss you.
Don't die.
Let me show you.
Libby, my heart's going to bust.
Mine too.
What are we going to do about it?
I don't know.
What's the matter?
I've got something to tell you.
I've been putting it off and putting it off.
Daddy wants me to go away to college.
He's sending me to SMU.
I'm not going to let you go away from me.
We'll see each other summers.
I'll write to you.
I don't want your letters, I want you.
Why don't they live their own
lives? Why don't they leave us alone?
We're alone now.
Libby, I wish I weren't such a kid.
Never mind.
When I used to come in this late,
I'd find my father waiting up...
...with a glass of hot milk and a lecture.
Which one do you want first?
I don't like hot milk, I can tell you that.
You won't like the lecture either.
What were you doing all this time?
We went on a picnic.
Is that what you call it?
Until 2:00 in the morning?
You know, Mama, big boys stay up late.
It's not the hour that matters...
...or that flushed look, or the lipstick.
Oh, Theron, I can understand
someone wanting to kiss you.
It's just that I think
nice young girls ought to-
Her name's Libby Halstead.
She's a wonderful girl, Mama.
I'm sure she is.
And I'm gonna keep on seeing her.
Well, have I said you shouldn't?
As a matter of fact, I've kept a
special Venetian lace tablecloth...
...and a silver bowl to use on the table,
first time you bring a girl home to supper.
She won't come here.
All right then. If she's shy,
you call on her at her house.
I can't.
Her father hates the sight of me.
Hates you?
Yes, he turned me out of his house.
What do you mean, "turned you out"?
What did he do? What did he say?
I want to know.
First night I went there,
the night of the barbecue-
There must have been a misunderstanding.
He wouldn't dare do that to
you. Didn't he know who you were?
Yes, he knew who I was.
He slammed the door in my face...
...said he didn't want
my kind hanging around.
As though he could tell by
looking at me I was no good.
Nobody ever looked at me
like that before, Mama.
As though he didn't care what my name was.
It was me he was looking at.
Your name was all he saw.
Theron, listen. Listen to me.
I'll tell you what Mr. Halstead saw in you.
Your name. Your father's name.
It had nothing to do with you personally.
He didn't trust his daughter
with you because of your father.
He knows about your father.
Everyone knows about your father.
Knows what?
Oh, he's not the kind
of a man you think he is.
There's hardly a woman in town whose
name hasn't been linked with his...
...at one time or another.
Oh, I've tried to keep the
truth from you as best I could.
He's been notorious since he was your age.
Like father, like son.
That's what Mr. Halstead was thinking.
Oh, it had nothing to do with
you personally, you understand?
I don't
- I don't believe it!
I don't believe it!
In polite circles, they may
call him a ladies' man...
...and in church, they call him an adulterer.
I don't care what they call
him, what anybody says about him.
I'm not just anybody!
I don't wanna hurt you, Mama...
...but if he did have a lot of
women, maybe he had a reason.
Oh, yes, he had a reason.
I haven't lived with him
since before you were born.
I know what a shock it is to you, Theron...
...but just think what it's been like for me.
You've been able to believe
in him a lot longer than me.
I was just his bride of four
months when I found out about him.
We'd done the grand tour of Europe...
...and then he'd brought
me back here to this house.
I remember we stood on the
front porch and he said to me:
"Stop a minute, I want to kiss you. "
And I couldn't wait and
I ran inside ahead of him.
And I thought the house was empty.
And then I heard this strange sound...
...like a cat mewing.
And I looked up and there on the stairway
was this thin, dark, wild, young girl...
...with her hand pressed against her mouth...
...and her big brimming eyes staring at me.
And I knew she was the one who was
making that terrible whimpering sound.
And then I saw something
pulling at her skirt...
...and hiding behind her and crying too.
I saw it was a child.
A boy, 5 years old.
Blond, as he is now.
His illegitimate son, Rafe.
Rafe.
Rafe!
Oh, Theron, I-
Theron? How long have
you been standing there?
Come on in. I got something
I want to show you.
How do you like this? Circassian walnut.
That's as good a grain as
you'd find in a fine briar pipe.
You're not doing anything today, are you?
Why don't you come on out with your old man?
No, I can't.
Well, I know I'm not in your class
but I'll try to keep up with you.
I got something else to do.
Well, forget it.
Come on, we'll make a day of it.
I'll stand you a good lunch, how about that?
I don't want any part of you.
You better have a good reason
for talking to me like that, boy.
You mean I'm not showing you enough respect?
Well, what makes you think
you've got any coming?
Now, before I belt you right across
the mouth, get it off your chest.
Now, come on, get it said.
As far as I'm concerned, there's
only one bastard in this family...
...and I don't mean it's Rafe.
Rafe?
So that cat's finally out of the bag, huh?
I assume your mother told you about that.
Well, don't let it cause
you any trouble, Theron.
That's ancient history.
- Is that all you've got to say?
- Theron, look.
I'm not about to give you an explanation
about my private life and business.
I'm your father. I don't
answer to you for anything.
- Well, you're his father too.
- He eats.
He's got a roof over his head.
He's got no cause for complaint.
Your dogs eat. Your dogs got a roof.
Now, just what would you have me do, Theron?
Would you have me make him a
beneficiary in the insurance policy?
Give him a key to the house?
Bring him home, sit him down
at the table next to your mama?
Yes. That'll do for a start.
Oh, live in the real world, boy. Rafe
does. He doesn't come whining to me.
He's my brother and he belongs
to this family as much as I do.
He has as much right to everything I have.
And that doesn't mean any of your handouts.
He's the best there is.
And if you were any kind-
If you were any kind of a man,
you'd be proud of him and love him.
I claim what I wanna claim. Nobody tells me-
- Well, I'm gonna tell you.
- No, you're not. Shut up and listen.
I sowed the wild oats of my
youth in a haystack one night.
But that doesn't mean that
I'm gonna ruin my name...
...and damage this family
by bringing in a stray.
- He's your son!
- His mother was a tramp.
A sandhill tacky, having her
child by the edge of a ditch.
She must've been some pig
to crawl in bed with you.
We'll just let that
- We'll just let that pass in the heat of the moment.
You may not think very highly
of me right now, young man...
...but you're my next of kin.
Legal, legitimate. Born in marriage.
With my name and everything
that goes with it.
And that's the way of the world.
There are the ins and the outs,
the haves and the have-nots.
You're lucky. You've got yours.
I'll never take anything
from you as long as I live.
And you can count on that.
Theron!
Theron!
Well, Hannah, you got the payoff
you've been waiting for all these years.
Well, what good is it gonna do you?
He hates me all right.
But he hates you too for telling him.
You're gonna get in there
and stay in there or...
You're getting to smell too
high to keep around the house.
Get in there. You're gonna
get clean or you're gonna go.
Come on in, but close the door.
I got a wet pup going here.
Come on. Come on.
Oh, boy.
This dog sure hates water.
Where have you been all day?
I've been looking for you.
Walking around. I was downtown.
I got a job at the cotton compress.
An everyday job?
I'm moving out of the house.
I'm going on my own.
Your daddy know about that?
No.
- I don't think he's gonna like it.
- Well, I don't give a damn.
You've had some kind of fuss with him.
Yeah.
What about?
You.
I know all about you now, Rafe.
All about me?
I don't think you do.
You know, I was hanging around
the day they named you in church.
Hanging around the birthday-cake parties...
...they gave you every year of your life.
Hanging around on the Fourth of July
when they set off firecrackers for you.
When they gave you ponies
and electric trains.
When they drove you up and
down the main street of town...
...in an open touring car so
everybody could see the son and heir.
Somewhere along the line, I got a
notion some of that was coming to me.
I used to tear my pants regularly...
...when I'd climb over that
fence and get in the house.
And my mama tied me up with
a length of clothesline...
...and said, "I'm gonna keep you this way...
...until you learn one thing:
He don't want you. Keep away. "
I howled like a dog on the end of that line.
Then my mama died...
...and Chauncey came down here and he said:
"You gotta learn to make out on your own.
Tears and crying and carrying
on is a waste of time.
Colored folks know that...
...and little white orphan
boys gotta learn it too.
So hitch up your pants and be a man. "
I never cried again where
anybody could see me.
I went to the bank. I took out all my money.
Six hundred and fifty
dollars. I want you to have it.
Bill of sale of my car. Keys.
I want you to have it too.
It's not much. It's all I own.
It's not enough.
Nobody will ever be able
to make it up to you.
Well, you're sure trying.
Can you put me up for the night?
I don't wanna go back up there.
Nothing easier.
If you don't mind sleeping with this pup.
You had your supper?
I'm not hungry.
Sit down.
And take a drink of this.
Make you sleep like a baby.
If I'd known I was having company, I
would've fixed up some special chow.
A catfish fry maybe.
Now, that's real good eating.
You take a couple of those
fish, you clean them...
...and put some bacon fat in a pan...
...chunk up an onion or
two and clap a lid on it.
Fifteen minutes later,
you're eating like a king.
You'll pass muster as a working man.
They pay me for an eight-hour day.
If you'll excuse me, that's
just what I'm gonna give them.
I hold a mortgage on this place, Theron.
I think it's enough to buy
five minutes of your time.
You intend to keep me in the deep
freeze all the rest of your natural life?
You young'uns sure are tough.
You know, when I was a boy, I had
two bad quarrels with my father.
We never let the sun set
on either one of them.
We just shook hands and
there were no hard feelings.
I'm not a perfect man, Theron.
When you're in your 40s, you
won't be a perfect man either.
You can't live that long without
hurting some and disappointing others.
I guess feet of clay are pretty
much standard equipment everywhere.
I've got mine just like anyone else.
I'm only human.
But there's one thing I reserve for myself...
...and that's the right to make my own
mistakes without being judged for them.
So don't judge me.
Just be a son to me and take me as I am.
Fair enough?
If Rafe's no son to you,
you're no father to me.
Well, you took your time coming.
Now, you get him out of here.
I can't stand him when
he's drunk and disorderly.
It frazzles my nerves.
It's all there. Every single solitary cent.
Just looking.
Come on.
- Come on.
- No. No.
Give me my hat.
I can't stand the smell of
that cheap perfume of Opal's.
It'll wash off.
How long was I shacked up up there?
I started missing you three days ago.
I needed some cheerful company.
Looks like I'm heading
into a lonely old age, Rafe.
I'm not held in very high esteem
around my house these days.
I don't think it'll bother you
too much in the morning, captain.
You know, I could've spared
myself a lot of trouble.
I should've run you off
the day you were born...
...and never had to look at
you again. I could've lost you.
Why didn't you?
Well, that's a good question.
Maybe I was just curious. I
wanted to see how you'd turn out.
Well, that's a reason.
You know, you haven't turned out half bad.
You know how to stand on your own two feet.
You get along in the world.
I'll tell you something...
...you've got my respect for that.
I don't care too much
for your respect, captain.
What else you got to offer?
Well, now, just what was
it you'd have me offer?
Well, whatever it is, you're
gonna have to volunteer.
I ain't gonna ask for it.
When you feel up to it,
we'll finish the rounds.
Dr. Carson, how is she?
Theron...
...your mama's had a whopper of a collapse.
I never have seen her give way
like that as long as I've known her.
Now, Theron, I want a word with you.
I've given her sedatives and
everything in this little bag...
...but the one thing she wants...
...is that you should be back
in this house and at her side.
And that is what you're damn well gonna do...
...unless you want her on your conscience.
Now, get in there. She needs you.
Let her know you're back
here to stay. You hear?
Go on.
Remember me?
Hello, Libby.
Would you care to trust your life
to me and let me drive you home?
I usually walk on down
the road. Thank you anyway.
I'd like to talk to you, Theron.
You've gotten thin, haven't you?
I don't know. Maybe.
You look older.
I've been all right.
It's been 42 days since we've seen
each other. That's six whole weeks.
Why don't we see each other anymore, Theron?
I've been thinking all
kinds of things about myself.
I've been thinking, "He thinks
I'm cheap. He thinks I'm easy. "
Libby, pull over there.
Libby, my mother's sick.
She got sick by hating my father.
To look at them, you wouldn't
know there was anything wrong.
They don't fight out in the open.
They just live in the same house and
kill each other a little at a time.
And I'm in the middle.
I'm supposed to take sides.
I'm supposed to ask, "Which one
are you going to be for today? "
He says I'm his son, she says I'm her son.
But nobody has ever said "our son. "
They pull me in half like
that every day of my life.
That's what they call love.
That's what they call being a family.
Well, I'll go on with her. I owe her that.
That's what she had me for.
But if this is what being part
of a family can do to you...
...I'm never gonna get married and have kids.
I'm never gonna do this to them.
But Theron, if we got married and
had a child, it wouldn't be like that.
- It couldn't.
- Couldn't it?
My mother and father started
out thinking they were in love.
I'm not going down that road,
Libby. I've made up my mind...
...so find yourself somebody else.
Well, you don't give me much choice...
...except to hang on to
my pride and say goodbye.
Thank you.
Good evening, Captain Hunnicutt.
My name is Halstead, Albert Halstead.
Yes, sir, I believe I know you.
You have the appliance store, don't you?
That's the one. I've been
on that corner for 20 years.
How's business, sir?
Well, I guess I can't complain.
Well, what brings you here, Albert?
Just a misunderstanding,
really. No more than that.
Go ahead.
Well, on the night of the barbecue...
...your boy came calling
on my daughter Libby...
...and I turned him away from my door.
Now, that was a terrible thing for me to do.
You run him off, huh?
Well, you know, I can't
explain my behavior that night.
I really am sorry.
I never was more mistaken in
my life than about your Theron.
What do you mean "mistaken"?
You mean, thinking he
might be like his father?
Well, you'll pardon my saying so...
...but I know your reputation...
...and, well, I was afraid.
We're not here to discuss my
reputation, are we, Albert?
No. No, no, of course not.
Well, as one father to another...
...I'm worried about my Libby.
I think she likes your boy and, well...
...maybe your Theron still thinks about her.
I just can't bear to see her upset.
So I mean, if your boy still
wants to come calling...
...well, I'd welcome him into
my house like a son of my own.
You know, Albert...
...you're talking to an old
hand at this sort of thing.
Now, your girl wouldn't be
in trouble, would she, Albert?
Why, it's nothing like that at all.
I mean, what do you take her for, anyway?
I just don't wanna...
...put any stumbling blocks in
the path of two nice young people.
You got sweat on your face, Albert.
You know what I think?
I think your girl just made a mistake...
...with some stranger passing
through, and he's out of range by now.
You're trying to shotgun an innocent boy.
Now, Albert, you've been
in business long enough-
Twenty years on the same corner.
- not to try to sell me any damaged goods.
Do you know who the father is?
No.
I'm sorry, Albert...
...about what I said about damaged goods.
That's all right. I deserve it.
She doesn't, but I do.
This was my idea.
If there have been any mistakes made...
...I made them.
Yeah. All our children
deserve better parents.
Thanks.
Good evening, Albert, I'm sorry.
What's the matter?
They're gonna have me
drinking chicory, Miss Libby.
Coffee's gone up two cents again.
- What are you doing in this market, Rafe?
- Oh, storing up nuts for the winter.
Haven't seen you around in some time.
You look a little peaked, Miss Libby.
- Oh, I'm fine. Just fine.
- You sure?
Will you look at the things that a man buys?
Chili, chocolate cupcakes,
jelly beans, frozen pizza.
A person would know you're
a bachelor and not healthy...
...if that's the way you eat.
I'm no French chef, that's for sure.
But I don't have a woman
fussing around the place either.
Well, what do you do when
you're sick and all by yourself?
Castor oil in the spring,
mustard plaster in the fall.
Come down and have a cup of coffee
with me and I'll tell you some more.
- Will you buy me some popcorn?
- No.
- Will you buy me some candy?
- No.
- Cookies?
- No.
Thirty-five cents, please.
- Please?
- No!
- Will you buy me some cookies?
- No.
- Two cups of coffee, please.
- Yes, sir.
Now...
...where was I?
You were leading a lonely,
disorderly, unhealthy life...
...and enjoying every minute of it.
I guess I make out as good as the next one.
Who irons your shirts? And
who sweeps under your bed?
- Who spends your money?
- Me.
Aren't you ever going to put
yourself on the marriage market, Rafe?
I know all kinds of girls who'd
be wild to get a chance at you.
Nice girls, who would give you
a good home and look after you.
Wouldn't have to tie you down.
That's what you're afraid of.
You could still be free as
the air, no questions asked.
You ought to sell this from door to
door. You're making quite a pitch.
No, I just think it's a shame...
...that a nice boy like you
should be out of the running.
Are you flirting with me?
Yes, I am.
You're the kind of girl that
goes around with one man...
...gets engaged to one
man and marries one man.
Last time I looked, it wasn't me.
Oh, Rafe.
Tell me your troubles,
Miss Libby, but don't cry...
...or the ladies are gonna have something
to talk about besides the price of beans.
I've gotta get married, Rafe, right away.
I've got to. Do you understand?
Yes, I think I do.
Have you told young Theron
he's gonna be a father?
- I can't.
- He's a good boy, Libby.
He won't let you down.
I'm not gonna throw myself at him.
Why not?
I know that family of his has
got a stranglehold on him...
...but you've got a bigger
claim on him than his mama.
He doesn't think so.
He says that he never
wanted to get married...
...and never wanted to have children.
That's why I've been trying
this cheap trick on you, Rafe.
No harm done.
You let me go talk to him about this.
I could have done my own talking.
I'm not gonna force him and have
him hate me for it afterwards.
Oh, Rafe, what did I do? What?
It took some time to work
up this tangle, Miss Libby.
It might take me a minute
or two to unsnarl it.
You know, you got a point about me.
My eating habits are none too good.
My way of life is kind of tacky.
How'd you like a chance to change all that?
Marry me.
I thought I was solving your problem.
It looks like I'm adding to it if
you're gonna sit there and bawl.
Why would you do a thing like that to me?
Oh, any number of reasons.
One is you're a girl with
very taking ways, Miss Libby.
I thought so the first time I met you.
And nothing has happened
to make me change my mind.
And number two...
...there are too many little, unwanted
kids running around loose in this world.
This one's gonna have a home...
...and a daddy.
Did the judge give you a nice ceremony?
- Yep, real nice.
- That's good.
Well, I guess I ought to kiss the bride...
...and shake hands with the groom.
We just waited to say goodbye.
The lawn is all watered...
...and I hung the swing
back up onto the tree...
...so you two can sit in
the shade if you want to.
I put a cold chicken in the ice box.
And there's some ice cream. Peach.
Oh, I've nearly forgot.
I'd better turn over the keys.
You young people will be having the house...
...all to yourselves.
Yes, sir.
Well, if we're gonna get there before dark...
Dang this door. It sticks all the time.
I'll fix it for you.
Would you like to see the rest of the house?
Mama says the sun fades the carpets.
There sure are a lot of little
glass bottles and stuff around.
Do you think you'll like it here?
I haven't been in a room this nice...
...since I went to the hospital
to have my appendix taken out.
Happy wedding day, Libby.
I'm gonna try and be a
good wife to you, Rafe.
Libby, listen.
Anything that happens between us...
...will be because you want it to happen.
Why, hello there, Theron Hunnicutt.
Maybe you don't recognize
me in this dim light.
Opal Bixby. I was to your barbecue.
You mind if I sit down alongside of you here?
What's that you're drinking? Beer?
It don't sit right on my stomach.
I'd rather have Scotch and water.
But beer is all you can
get around here, I guess.
- Two beers.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.
- Right.
Now...
I was so surprised to hear you went
to work down at the cotton compress.
I'm a personal friend of
the foreman down there...
...and he told me you'd been
there six or seven months.
You're doing real good too.
Why you'd want to take a
job like that, I don't know.
I thought your daddy had
all the money in the world.
Why, you've got the glooms, haven't you?
I'll bet some girl threw you over.
Well, you're lucky you ran into me,
because I got just the cure for that.
There's a wonderful trio of
jazz players playing across the-
The street...
...and I thought that maybe
you and I could go over there...
...and we'd dance a little bit.
And then, maybe later,
we'd go up to my place...
...and I'd fix you a little midnight supper.
Midnight or later, whenever
you feel like eating.
Libby?
What is it?
Libby?
There, there, now.
There, there. It's gonna be all right.
I was having a bad dream.
Let's not get all shook up.
Let's get a little light on the subject.
Now, you see? Nothing scary in here.
Just a girl with a couple of
pigtails hanging over her shoulder...
...and a spot of cold cream on her nose.
- I know, I look terrible.
- I've seen worse.
- I'm sorry I woke you up.
- I wasn't asleep.
I do all my heavy thinking after dark.
What about?
Well, you get a fair share of it.
- Do I?
- Yes, indeed.
I'm awake now. Why don't you tell me?
Well, I consider myself a lucky man.
I can look up any morning...
...and see your smiling face
across the table from me.
And I can hear you singing just a
little bit flat in your shower bath.
And I say to myself, "Rafe Copley,
you've got yourself a real woman.
She's gonna exert a powerful
influence for good on you...
...because she's kind and
soft-spoken and good-natured. "
And I say to myself, "You just keep
a lid on your stronger feelings...
...and be patient and wait. "
And that last part I think
about gets to be private.
So you snuggle down.
I'm gonna tuck you in and turn out the light.
And you'll be able to see the
moon come in through the trees.
You'll be asleep in no time. You
got nothing to worry about, Libby.
I'm just one holler away.
That's too far, Rafe.
Libby, you better understand something.
If I stay, I'm gonna be
more than a comfort to you.
Stay.
Name this child.
- Albert Terence.
- Albert T erence.
Albert T erence, I baptize thee
in the name of the Father...
...and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.
- Congratulations, Albert.
- Congratulations, Albert.
- Thank you.
- Albert, congratulations.
- Thank you. Thank you.
A beautiful baby.
- Congratulations, Albert.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
You wait for me out front,
Sarah. I'll go and get the car.
Fine.
Yes, we were so proud of you.
You were so good. Yes, you were.
Here, let me take him.
Here, here, Albert Terence.
Now, you don't know it yet...
...but you're gonna like
the world you live in.
Well, as long as you're in it, Rafe.
I'm not such a bad family man, am I?
Best there is.
Oh, now, come on, now.
Doggone, the captain's
gone and done it again.
Boy, did you all see that baby?
It was the captain to the
like. Like two peas in a pod.
Do you reckon that Albert knows?
Well, all I know is what happened
up to Wade's house that night.
- So naturally, I put two and two together.
-  Y eah, Wade's done it again.
Say, how many do you suppose
he's fathered in this town?
I don't know. You can be
sure this ain't the first.
And it won't be the last.
Say, how much do you suppose
he paid Rafe Copley...
...to make an honest woman of that girl?
What kind of filthy
things are you men saying?
How long you been listening, Albert?
What are you saying...
...about my little girl?
You weren't meant to hear any of it, Albert.
Are you saying that...?
Are you saying that Wade Hunnicutt
is the father of that baby?
It's a lie.
It's a lie.
It's a filthy lie!
Albert...
...you know the kind of man Wade is.
We...
We...
We're awfully sorry, Albert.
Theron, where you been?
Melba made you strawberry
waffles for breakfast...
...and then we couldn't
find you, so I ate yours.
Rafe and Libby named their
baby this morning, Mama.
They're gonna be happy
the rest of their lives.
What am I gonna do, Mama?
Just keep on playing chess?
Wade.
May I interrupt you for a moment?
Why, certainly, Hannah.
Sit down.
What are we gonna do about Theron?
He gets up in the morning, goes to work.
Walks the streets, night after night.
Comes home to sit in his room in the dark.
My heart breaks every time I look at him.
I've looked at him too.
Hardly seems like a boy anymore.
He's so changed.
Well, what do you expect?
We're rotten parents, Hannah.
This is a rotten home.
We've got to do something, Wade.
I don't care what it is.
I agree. Now, just what do you suggest we do?
He's got to think well of both of us or
he'll never think well of either of us.
We have to make our peace, you and I.
We have to find some way of
living together with dignity...
...for his sake.
Hannah...
...I'm too young for peace and dignity.
You are too.
You really want to mend our fences?
You really want to make a home for our boy?
Well, there's only one way to do
that, and that's as man and wife.
You're asking a lot of a good hater, Wade.
I want a lot.
Yes, I know.
I give you credit, Hannah.
You've been a number-one adversary.
I've lost every major battle to you.
What was it the man said? "War is hell"?
Well, it's been hell in this house,
for you, for me and for the boy.
And that can't go on.
You say you want to change,
then let's make a change!
Let's begin by living, you and me.
As I remember, you had
quite a talent for that.
It's been 18 years.
I'm not that girl anymore.
How do you know I won't disappoint you?
I'll buy two steamship tickets.
We'll go back to Naples,
where it all started.
We'll find out.
You make it sound so simple.
I know it's not simple, Hannah.
I know what we've been
through. We've got scars on us.
They're gonna show the rest of our lives...
...but the point is we've still
got some life left to live.
Maybe you can arrange to forgive me.
Not all at once.
Just a little bit every day.
Maybe I can.
I don't know.
I was happy in Naples.
Oh, dear God.
Melba, get the doctor.
Get the doctor, Melba. Run, Melba, run!
Rafe.
Get me Rafe.
Get me Rafe!
He's still alive, Miss Hannah.
Don't give way, captain. Don't give way.
You've been in worse fixes than this before.
Didn't you lay out in the
woods two days one time...
...hit by some fool hunter?
You come through that, didn't you?
You been cracked up and smashed
up a dozen times I know of...
...and you got over it.
And you knit up so quickly...
...hardly any use for a doctor at all.
So you rest easy, captain, and hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on, captain.
Rafe!
Come quick.
He's calling for help, Chauncey.
He ain't said a word, Miss Hannah.
I hear him.
I'm here.
Listen to me. I'm here.
I've waited my whole life
to hear you say two words.
Now say it before you die.
It's just two words.
"My son. "
Say it.
"My son. "
Say it.
Say it.
Theron!
Who did it? Who did it?
I don't know!
- He took the truck, I didn't see his eyes.
- I'll go.
- No.
- He was my father too.
No.
You got a wife and child.
You gotta stay alive.
Get out of my way.
Oh, hi, Theron. What can I do for you today?
- Did my father's truck go by?
- Did it ever.
Ninety miles an hour,
straight down that road.
I'd judge about 10 minutes ago.
But you'll never catch
him, the rate he was going.
It's getting dark.
Cold.
Let's us go on home.
No.
You won't be alone. I'll be
alongside you every minute.
I can't go back.
How could I ever look at Libby again?
What'll you do?
I don't know.
Tell them I'll...
I'll go away as far as I can get.
Tell them that I turned up lost.
Well, what'll I tell myself, sonny?
That I'll be all right.
That I'll make out okay.
I will, Rafe.
You're just a colt.
You ain't even steady on your legs yet.
How do you expect to make out
in the world, all by yourself?
The same way you did, Rafe.
Miss Hannah.
Chauncey told me I'd find you here.
I'm glad to see you're up around again.
Yes, today's my first time out, Rafe.
Well, it's a fine day for it.
Sky's nice and blue.
Sun's warm.
Yes, it's a fine day.
Melba tells me you came by every
single day for weeks and weeks...
...while I lay in bed.
She said you were never empty-handed.
Flowers, jelly, home-baked cakes.
Oh, I looked in now and then.
You know, after it happened,
I lay upstairs in the dark...
...feeling as if my mind
had been cut in two by an ax.
My husband dead and my son gone away from me.
But all that time, I felt there was
someone sitting downstairs in my kitchen.
Someone who had pity for me and
cared whether I lived or died.
You, Rafe.
Miss Hannah...
...don't stay by yourself in that big house.
What shall I do with myself?
Come on over to me.
Libby and I are pretty green with that baby.
Maybe you'd like to take him for some walks.
Buy him some toys.
Teach him some manners.
Is he very beautiful?
He looks like his daddy.
I'd spoil him.
Help yourself.
Would today be too soon?
No, ma'am.
We got turkey for dinner.
Rafe...
...you haven't looked at the stone yet.
Well, that's a nice, handsome marker.
Why'd you do that, Miss Hannah?
Don't you think I'm capable
of a human gesture...
...just once in my life?
You want it out there like that?
For everybody to see?
Why not? What's there to hide?
He had two fine sons, didn't he?
Not till today, he didn't.
Come on. Let's us go on home.
