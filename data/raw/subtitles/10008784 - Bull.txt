If you could pick just one day
and undo it, make it go away,
make it never have happened...
...what day
would it be?
How about our wedding day?
I mean,
that would be a very efficient
choice, don't you think?
Because if you could
change that one day,
all the other days
the 18 years since
would just vanish, too.
Oh, I want to go into the city.
I want to go to the apartment
on Madison like we used to.
Spend the weekend in bed
just ordering food
and hold each other.
Come on, Rache. You made me
sell the place on Madison
a decade ago.
And as for spending
the weekend in bed,
we got a perfectly
good bed here.
And a cook.
Come on.
Whole weekend in bed?
Spending an hour in bed
at least with me
hasn't been something you've
expressed much interest in
in a very long time.
And that's fine.
Although if that's
what you want, I'm...
Do you hate me?
Okay.
Somebody...
has had too much wine.
I'm too rich to leave, aren't I?
That's the problem, isn't it?
The problem is that
when you're not at work,
you don't know what
to do with yourself
and so you start drinking
at 10:00 in the morning.
That's not the problem,
that's the solution.
Okay.
Time for us to go
back to shore.
Mm. I don't want to go in yet.
Come on.
We'll go back.
We'll take off our clothes
and we'll climb into bed,
just like you wanted.
What's her name?
What's whose name?
The girl in your head.
The girl you'll imagine you're
with while you're with me.
You are the girl in my head.
You know what
would make me happy?
It would make me happy to take
that fire extinguisher
and just...
smash you on the head with it.
I would enjoy that.
I can't do this anymore.
You've become
a monster.
You've made me a monster.
And stop crying.
God, I hate you when you cry.
You're such a sniveling
nothing of a man!
The keys!
Where did the keys go?
I have the keys.
I told you
I don't want to go in yet.
Just come away from the wheel
and pour me another drink.
Good morning and, as always,
we thank you for joining us.
Have you seen Peter?
Do you know where
Peter might be?
I haven't seen him
since last night.
Maybe he's still sleeping?
What'd you do to your wrist?
Oh.
I don't know.
It's nothing.
Pete?
You awake?
Peter!
My friends in the legal world
tell me that if you're staring
at a criminal trial
staring at a jury trial
you are the gentlemen
they would want by their side.
Are you staring
at a criminal trial?
This past weekend
my husband Peter and I
went out on our boat.
We were drinking.
And fighting.
Wh-When we finally
got back to shore
it was dark and Peter was...
not ready to get off the boat.
Intoxicated.
Yes.
I think we both were.
The last time I saw him
was down below
in the sleeping compartment,
which was not unusual for him.
Not unusual for us.
I docked the boat, went back
to the house. Figured
he'd find his way back in
later that night.
When I woke up this morning,
I couldn't find him.
I went down to the boat.
He wasn't there.
But there was blood.
Did you call the police?
They're still out there.
Investigating.
I answered all their questions.
Without a lawyer?
Yes.
Because...
why not?
But I could tell
from the way
they were speaking to me,
the way they were
looking at me...
That you were
a suspect.
So,
you awoke this morning
to discover
that you didn't know
where your husband was.
You called the police.
They came to your house.
And then...
you came to work?
I didn't know where to go.
I-I wanted to look for him,
but where do you look?
We-we were on the water.
I want to believe
he's still alive.
But alive where?
Other than the fact that you
were the last person to see him,
is there any other
reason anyone would have
to suspect you of foul play?
Two months ago, we...
threw a party at the lake house.
About a hundred people.
Peter and I got into it.
He says I get mean when I drink.
I do get mean when I drink.
Apparently, I got loud
and really abusive.
Really let him have it.
Everyone saw.
Or so I was told.
Or so you were told.
Do you suffer from blackouts,
Mrs. Thomas?
I don't know what that means.
I suffer from drinking too much
and not always remembering
everything afterward.
What happened to your wrist?
Oh.
Oh, this.
I was walking my dog.
He took off after a squirrel.
Pulled me down onto the sidewalk
with him. I landed on it.
Bruised it pretty badly.
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Mrs. Thomas.
It's the medical
examiner's office.
Okay.
They found the body
down the shore.
Apparently, he drowned,
but there's also
significant blunt force trauma
visible on the back
of the skull.
So, here's the thing.
Almost everybody
has had too much to drink
at one time or another,
but this "I don't remember"
is not going to be
an easy sell to a jury
as a defense for murder.
We taking the case?
She's Rachel Thomas.
She's one of the wealthiest,
smartest women
in all of New York.
She manages a hedge fund
worth over five billion dollars.
That woman
did not get to the top
by being reckless.
She's one of the brightest minds
to ever walk the floors
of the stock exchange.
You really think the best plan
she could come up with
to get rid of her husband
was to hit him on the head
and throw him in the lake?
Hell yeah,
we're taking this case.
But there is nothing to divide.
There is nothing to buy out.
It was my apartment when
we got married the first time,
my apartment when
we got married the second time,
and it is still my apartment.
This isa civil tone.
This is as civil as my tone gets
when someone is trying to take
something of mine
that they have no right to.
I have to go now.
Bull
and Benny apologize
for not joining,
but they are at a bail hearing
for our new client,
Rachel Thomas, who, moments ago,
was officially charged
with second-degree murder.
They are convinced
that the prosecution
is gonna try
to persuade the jury
that the marriage
was falling apart.
That Mr. Thomas
was being unfaithful,
and that Rachel was enraged
and killed him
in a moment of passion.
Can they prove any of that?Well,
the first part of it
was definitely true.
The Thomases
had enough fights in public
that rounding up people
to testify to their animus
shouldn't be a problem.
The cheating is another matter.
Rachel is convinced of it,
but from what
Bull and Benny can surmise,
she doesn't really have
any hard evidence.
So where does that leave us?Well,
here's the thing.
Peter didn't know it yet,
but Rachel had already retained
a divorce lawyer.
She had already
decided to leave him.
So she really had
no practical motive to kill him.
I beg to differ.
If she had divorced Peter,
it would have cost her
half her fortune.
It wouldn't have cost her half.
They had a prenup.
A very aggressive prenup.
Remember?
Even back when
they first married
18 years ago,
she was a wealthy businesswoman.
He was a failed playwright.
Here it is.
It even stipulates
that if he were caught cheating,
he would leave the marriage
with nothing.
So then
doesn't it stand to reason
that if we can prove that Peter
was actually having an affair
and that Rachel knew about it
that she had no motive at all?
The affair would mean
she wouldn't have had
to give him a dime.
When it comes to the jury,
I think the key
is gonna be eliminating
anyone prone to rage bias.
Rage bias?
What on God's earth is that?
People who have rage bias
tend to exhibit...
I am so sorry to interrupt.
Uh, Bull,
could I just have a word
with you outside for a moment?
It'll be very brief.
What's so urgent?
It's our new client.
Our bank just called.
The check she wrote
for our retainer
it bounced.
Are you sure?
Maybe they made a mistake.
That's Rachel Thomas.
I watched her write the check
myself.
It came
from her personal account.
I'm just telling you
what they told me.
All right.
I'll handle it.
I'll find the right moment
and I will speak to her.
I am sure
it's just a misunderstanding.
Sorry. Where were we?
You were explaining
rage bias.
Yes. People
with this particular bias
believe that those
who let their emotions
run away with them
are a danger
to themselves and others.
They won't have any trouble
making the leap that
because you are capable of
acting out against your husband
in front of a room
full of people
that you would also
be capable of killing him.
So w-what do we do about that?
All right, let's play "what if."
Okay.
What if it's rush hour
and it's raining?
You're trying to get a cab,
you finally hail one down,
you're about to get in
when someone rushes past you
and tries to steal
the cab away from you.
What do you do?
The truth?
I kick, claw, spit, bite and
pull the other person's hair,
and if that doesn't work...
We get the idea.
My kind of gal.
Your Honor,
this juror is acceptable
to the defense.
And that means we have our jury.
Let's break for lunch
and then reconvene to hear
opening statements
and perhaps start calling
prosecution witnesses.
So, what's your sense?
My sense is we have
a long way to go.
Benny, would you, uh, go across
the street, get us a table?
We'll meet you there.
Two things.
Uh, the check
you wrote us
the bank returned it.
It bounced.
Oh, my God.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
I'm so sorry.
I... I wrote it
on my personal account,
and I know
this is horrifying to hear
from someone who does what I do
for a living, but sometimes
I don't even bother to...I'm not really
concerned about it.
I know you're good for it.
Do you have any idea
how upset you just got?
Well, it's-it's upsetting.
It's embarrassing. I'm-I'm...
I-I...Well, it's nothing compared
to what we're doing here.
We're...
We're fighting for your life.
We're fighting for your freedom.
You're accused of killing a man,
and yet you sit here
in front of these people who are
gonna judge you the people
who are going to
decide your fate
and you seem
not the least bit upset
that the man you claim
you didn't kill
was taken from you
little more than a week ago.
You don't look shocked,
you don't look sad.
You look like you're ready
to run a board meeting.
Do you miss him?
Course I miss him.
I don't mean to pry, but what
exactly are you writing down?
It's just a note.
Remind myself
to do all the things you said
look sad,
look like I'm in shock.
Shall we go?
Dr. Ortiz, as the Nassau County
medical examiner
who first examined
Peter Thomas' corpse,
can you share with us
the official cause of death?
Mm-hmm. Cause of death
was determined to be drowning
after blunt force trauma
to the left temporal lobe,
which is part of the head
just above the ear.
And what can you
tell us about
Mr. Thomas'
blood alcohol content?
It was quite high .25
about three times
the legal limit.
Now, your report
indicates that Mr. Thomas
weighed over 200 pounds.
Would the fact that he was so
intoxicated have made it harder
or easier for a smaller person
let's say someone
the size of
the defendant
to overpower
Mr. Thomas and then
knock him over
the side of the boat?
Seems to me
it'd make it easier.
No further questions,
Your Honor.
Remember you told me
how much you missed him?
Wouldn't hurt to wince a bit
every time you heard his name.
Mm?
Good afternoon, Dr. Ortiz.
Now, just to recap.
You are saying you believe
someone struck Mr. Thomas
in the back of the head,
creating...
What was it you called it?
Blunt force trauma.
Exactly.
Blunt force trauma.
And then either dumped
or pushed him into the water.
As I said,
that's what the evidence
seems to suggest.
I see. But you
haven't actually
found the object that inflicted
this blunt force trauma,
have you?No, we have not.
Then how can you be so sure
of the order of events?
Couldn't Mr. Thomas,
who you already
testified was
incredibly intoxicated,
simply have lost his balance,
tumbled off the side of the boat
and hit his head
as he fell in the water?
Well, that's certainly
a possibility,
but not nearly as likely,
in my opinion.
What informed
that particular opinion?
The laceration
to the skull appears
as if it would have required
a significant amount of force.
Doesn't seem like a fall into
the water would get it done.
What if...
another boat was passing by?
What if Mr. Thomas's head
kept getting smashed
on the stern of his own vessel
over and over again
in the wake of the passing boat?
Something wrong
with my theory?
Is it any less plausible
than your theory,
which is based on the assumption
that my client's husband was hit
with an object
no one can prove even exists?
He's very good.
Is the problem
with my theory, Dr. Ortiz,
is that it makes
Mr. Thomas' death
seem more likely
the result of a drunken mishap
rather than homicide?
Objection,
Your Honor.
Counsel is
testifying.
Sustained.
The jury will disregard
counselor's last statements.
Ask a question, Counselor.
Actually, I have no further
questions, Your Honor.
Thank you.
Mr. Colón,
Dr. Bull, Mrs. Thomas,
any way I could borrow
your legal counsel for a moment?
There's something
I'd like to show them.
We just got these
from the Nassau County Police.
What are we looking at?
It's a fire extinguisher made
especially for use on boats.
Uh, they found it in the water
early this morning about
300 yards from where they
discovered Peter Thomas' body
the other day.
Serial number indicates
it was purchased by Mr. Thomas
about four and a half years ago.
It's dented.
Consistent with the kind of dent
you might expect
if it were used to, say...
Hit someone on the head.
Great minds.
Mm.There was still some blood
on it, some brain matter.
Uh, we're having
everything tested.
Uh, of course,
it was in the water over a week,
so who knows
what the tests will show.
But I wanted you
to be the second to know.
Dad. Wake up.
What are you doing here?
Dad?
Mm.
You can't just sit in
front of my door like this.
You're gonna
get me in trouble.
I'm sorry.
I didn't intend to fall asleep.
Been here for hours.
What are you
doing here?
Well, I called you,
like, 300 times.
I texted you, like, a million.
I came here to talk to you.
To tell you something.
Look, I-I know
you're not gonna believe me,
but... I have been praying
about this,
baby. I've been
reading about it,
I've been thinking about it.
And Anna, I know,
deep in my heart,
that this is wrong.
And I'm gonna keep telling you,
every inch of the way,
how wrong I think it is,
because maybe
I'll change your mind.
But if I can't change your mind,
you got to know there's no way
I'd let you
go through this alone.
There's no way I would let you
go through any of this
without being right there
by your side.
I promise you
I do not know
how that fire extinguisher got
off the boat and into the water,
much less
with the blood and the...
...whatever else
you said was on it.
They're telling us
that Peter's blood
was all over it.
And your fingerprints.
Of course my fingerprints
were all over it.
It belonged to me.
It-it was on my boat.
That well may be,
but we can't be sure a jury
is gonna see it that way.
The fire extinguisher is proof
that Peter's death
was no accident.
I had no reason to kill him.
But you told us your husband
was having an affair.
But that's not a reason
to kill someone.
That's a reason
to divorce someone.
Mrs. Thomas, we know
that if your husband
had cheated, you would
be entitled to a divorce
without any obligation
to pay anything.
No alimony, no asset sharing.
Everything reverts back to you.
Exactly.
The problem is our investigators
can find absolutely no
evidence of any affair.
Nothing.
Not a single text message,
not a single phone call,
not a single credit card charge.
There's just no
concrete proof.
And unfortunately, that
does give you motive.
Gentlemen... and lady,
I am worth just shy
of a billion dollars.
Are you suggesting that instead
of simply divorcing my husband
and living off
a mere half a billion,
I would choose to kill him?
Really?
Does...
does that make sense to anyone?
The People would like to call
Helen Potter.
Who's Helen Potter?
Helen Potter
she's your neighbor.
How do you know the Thomases,
Ms. Potter?
We live about
three houses apart.
Uh, I'm a full-timer.
It means I live there
all the time. Uh,
they're up weekends
and holidays.
I guess you could say
we're neighbors.
And your home, like their home,
sits on the lake
and looks out on the water,
giving you a clear view
of their dock, their boat,
a good portion
of the lake itself?Yes.
What did you see
on the date in question?
I saw Rachel and Peter
go out in the boat
at around 11:00 in the morning.
Uh, but that night,
when the boat returned,
I only saw Rachel.
And I-I didn't
see Peter at all.
And were you aware
of any friction
in your neighbor's marriage?
I think everyone
who lived in the neighborhood
was aware there was friction.
Can you give the court
an example?
Well, this year they threw
a party for Labor Day.
All the neighbors were there.
And Rachel started
a fight with Peter
over the fact that he was
talking to other women.
At one point talking to me.
H-He tried to calm her.
But he couldn't.
She was yelling at him.
Cursing at him.
I was embarrassed for him.
So other than the fact
that your house
is three houses away
from her house,
how well would you say
you know Mrs. Thomas?
Excuse me?
I-I'm not sure
I understand the question.
Well, I was listening
to your testimony,
and it sounded like you know
the Thomases quite well.
So...
how much time would you say
you've spent with the Thomases?
Well, I mean...
they have a Labor Day party
every year.
Ever been to
dinner with them?
No.
So, clearly, you've been to
their house for their parties,
has Mrs. Thomas
ever been to yours?
No.
Ah. I see.
And how about Mr. Thomas?
Oh, that's okay. That's
all right. Let me ask
a different question.
Now, you mentioned
that on the night in question,
you only saw Mrs. Thomas
leave the boat.
Is that correct?
Yes. Mr. Thomas
was nowhere to be seen.
But I'm sure you're aware
that Mrs. Thomas explained
to the police,
to the best of her knowledge,
that Mr. Thomas
was in the sleeping compartment.
Okay. I'm just not sure
I believe that.
Really?
Why not?
Because every time
they went out on the boat,
it was always Peter
who docked it.
Even if he ended up
sleeping on the boat.
He always tied it up.
That was just... his thing.
Really?
Every single time?
Ha!
Wow. For someone who...
hadn't really spent
a lot of time with them,
you certainly know a lot
about the Thomases
and their habits.
How is that?Objection.
Counsel is badgering
the witness.
Ms. Potter is not the one
on trial here.
Your Honor, I'm not trying
to badger anyone.
I'm just trying to understand
how Ms. Potter
came to her conclusions
when she seems to have had
very little contact
with my client.
Objection overruled.
Witness will answer
the question.That-That's all right.
That's all right.
Let me come at this
a different way.
Ms. Potter, on any given night,
how often do you check
whether the Thomases' boat
is at their dock?
I mean, it...
seems like you check
quite a bit.
Wh...
It's not that I check.
I-I can see it from my house.
It's just something I notice.
Mm.
Well, forgive me,
but isn't that a little curious,
considering you live
three houses down?
I mean, could you see their dock
from every vantage point
of your home?
No.
Not every vantage point.
But-But I can see it very
clearly from my upper deck.
So how does that work?
Do you just
sit in your upper deck all day,
watching whether Peter or Rachel
dock the boat that evening?
I mean, that is a little
peculiar, wouldn't you say?
Objection.
Uh, Your Honor,
counsel is badgering once again.
Sustained.
Tread lightly, Mr. Colón.
Ms. Potter, you testified
that Mrs. Thomas
had never been to your house.
How about Mr. Thomas?
And let me remind you
you are still under oath.
He... may have.
May have?
I'm sorry.
I need a yes or a no.
Yes.
Well...
that changes things a bit,
doesn't it?
Could you please tell the court
what Mr. Thomas was doing
at your house?
I don't know
what you're suggesting,
but Peter and I
were just neighbors.
I wasn't suggesting anything,
Ms. Potter.
But given where your mind went,
it tells me everything
I need to know.
Objection.
Argumentative.
Sustained. I apologize,
Your Honor.
But if it pleases the court,
I just have one more question.
So, clearly...
you made it your business
to keep an eye
on Peter's comings and goings.
So did you, by any chance,
go down to the Thomases' boat
to check on your neighbor
when you saw
that Rachel docked it
and went up to her house
that night?
Perhaps get into
a fight with him
over his refusal
to leave his wife?
No!
Objection.
No foundation.
Sustained.
Mr. Colón.
My apologies, Your Honor.
I have no further questions.
And what brings you
to Nassau County?
The train.
I just felt funny
e-mailing or texting you this.
What am I looking at here?
It's a death certificate.
A veterinary death
certificate.
Remember how Rachel told
you she hurt her wrist
while she was
walking her dog?
Rachel's dog was put
down about a year ago.
And, according to the vet,
she never got a new one.
She lied.
You ever wonder
about our client?
The way she has such
a tenuous grasp on her memory?
The way she can't remember
what happened
after her fight
with Peter on the boat?
Mm.
It's like I said from
the very beginning
seems like a very
convenient lapse.
Yeah.
But it's not isolated.
Today, she did not recognize
her neighbor at first.
Had no idea who she was.
And now Danny tells me her dog,
the one who
yanked her to the ground
it's how she hurt her wrist
dog's been dead for a year.
That's weird.Mm.
Dr. Bull.
Mrs. Thomas.
Anything new on my neighbor?
Her prints show up on the
fire extinguisher, perhaps?
They did not.
Your neighbor actually has
a rock-solid alibi.
And she voluntarily turned over
her home security DVR
and it clearly shows
that she was home all day
and all night while you and
your husband were on the boat,
but that's not what I wanted
to discuss with you.
Do you know what
early-onset Alzheimer's is?
Anyone out there in the hall
right behind me?
No.
This room is soundproof,
but I wouldn't want anyone
to read my lips.
Yes.
I'm familiar.
It's a kind of dementia.
50 million people have it.
When I flew to Britain
two and a half years ago
to be tested under a pseudonym,
they said mine was mild.
Mild, moderate, severe
those are the stages.
I was told mine
would surely move
to moderate at some point,
but it was impossible
to say when.
I'm so sorry.
You understand
that if my board of directors
know about my diagnosis,
I will be fired
from my own company.
You've known all along.
That's why you write things down
in those notebooks.
You want to make sure
nothing gets away from you.
You get used to being
the sharpest mind in the room,
and when that mind
no longer cooperates,
you develop tricks.
Well... for quite a while
you had me fooled,
and I'm a trained psychologist.
I know you mean that as
some sort of compliment, but...
I've lived my whole life
working, building,
trying to create a legacy,
trying to be someone
people will remember.
Then you wake up one day
to discover
you won't even remember
yourself.
I don't have close friends,
never had kids.
Barely know my nieces
and nephews.
I'm always working.
My husband, the one person
I had any true
connection to is...
One of the hallmarks
of this disease
is that people
become aggressive.
They have episodes of violence
that are totally
out of character.
Are you suggesting
I might have killed Peter?
I think it's certainly
a possibility.
And knowing
what I know now,
I'm considering
making your disease
a cornerstone of our defense.
You should
change your plea
to not guilty by
reason of insanity.
You have an opinion about that?
Would you and your company
like to continue on
as my legal team?
Very much.
Then you would do well to forget
everything you said here
this morning, most especially
that last suggestion.
Do we understand each other?
Perfectly.
I'll see you in court tomorrow.
See you in court.
We have the now-famous
fire extinguisher
with blood, bits of skull
and brain matter.
Does anyone know
when lunch is getting here?Taylor.
You know we were
all thinking it.
Shattered wine glass.
One unshattered wine glass.
Two empty bottles of wine.
One empty bottle of scotch.
And last
but not least...
...a plastic bag
inside a plastic bag.
Looks like one
of those bags you get
from the fruit
and vegetable aisle.
That doesn't make
any sense. It has, uh,
traces of lime, lipstick,
an eyelash... and sputum.
Really?
Whose sputum?
According to this,
Rachel's sputum.
You wanted to see me
before court this morning.
Yeah.
I think we have a good shot
at accomplishing our goals here.
Excellent.
When this is over
when we prevail
I need you to promise me
you will resign.
You're entitled
to your privacy,
but people pay you
for your judgment.
And to the extent
that's compromised...
And if I say no?
Then I'll withdraw
from the case.
Benny can't.
Judge won't allow it.
But I'm the one
calling the shots.
And without me, I'd say
you're looking at no less
than 20 years in prison.
You're a wealthy woman, Rachel.
For God's sake,
own your destiny.
Don't let it own you.
Resign with dignity.
If you don't,
if...
you manage to get away
with no jail time,
the truth about your condition
will leak out.
It always does.
And you'll be fired.
And sued.
And everything you have spent
all this time building
will have been for naught.
Dr. Miller,
if you could please explain to
the jury exactly who you are
and what it is you do.
I am a doctor
of forensic science.
I worked for the Nassau County
Police Department for 25 years.
I led their forensic unit
for 15 of those.
Then I retired
and opened up
my own private shop
about five years ago,
and I haven't had
a day off since.
Now, when you say you opened up
your own private shop,
can you please explain
the nature
of your work.The short version is I analyze
all the elements
of a given crime scene
in an attempt to create
a likely picture
of what actually happened.
The order of events.
Why it happened.
I like to think of myself
as a criminal puzzle solver.
Ah.
Excellent.
And did you have occasion
to review the evidence
in our case?
Just came
from the evidence locker.
I believe I've seen all of it.
Now, this plastic bag
that you and the jury are
seeing on the monitor
that was recovered
from the crime scene,
was it not?Yes, sir.
Recovered, tagged
and entered into evidence.
And you believe this plastic bag
is of enormous significance,
don't you?
I do.
It was recovered
from the boat
on the port side
near where the prosecution
believes that the struggle
between the defendant
and Peter Thomas took place.
And why are we just hearing
about this bag now?
Well, I can't answer that.
But it appears
that even though the bag
was submitted for lab testing,
nobody drilled down
on the results
because a plastic produce bag
didn't figure into the narrative
that police had come up with.
But you
have drilled down
on the lab results.
And what did they reveal?
They reveal that
the bag contained,
in addition to
lime remnants,
smeared traces of lipstick,
sunscreen, an eyelash
and a significant amount
of sputum.
I see.
And can you please
explain to the jury
what sputum is,
in layman's terms.
It's a combination of mucus,
saliva and blood
usually coughed up
from the lower airways.
And did you conduct
a DNA comparison to determine
the origin of the sputum?
I didn't have to.
The police did, and it belonged
to the defendant,
Rachel Thomas.
And based on your
knowledge and experience,
how do you explain the presence
of her sputum in the bag?
Well,
it seems to be the by-product
of a physical struggle
of the kind that might arise
if someone had placed the bag
over Mrs. Thomas' head
in an attempt to suffocate her.
Quiet, please.
Don't force me to clear
the courtroom.He tried to kill me?
I believe so.
Your witness.
Dr. Miller,
everything you just described
it's really just a guess,
isn't it?
I mean, you have no way
of knowing that's what happened.
Knowing?
Well, of course not.
There were no eyewitnesses,
and the defendant
doesn't remember what happened.
A yes or no, please.
Yes, I have no way of knowing.
All I can do is apply
everything I've learned,
everything I know,
and combine that
with the irrefutable facts
in front of me,
just like I've been doing
for the past three decades.
Just like I've done for you
over the past what is it
seven or eight cases
over the last few years.
No further questions,
Your Honor.
We just got
our first two greens.
Dr. Allendale, we asked you
to examine Rachel's mugshots,
which were taken
the morning Peter
was discovered missing.
As a medical expert,
what do you see
when you look at these?
Well, the first thing
that jumps out at you
is Mrs. Thomas' red, puffy eyes.
Are those from crying?
No, because in addition,
you also have
broken capillaries
beneath each eye.
That combination is consistent
with someone
who's had their airway blocked.
Hmm.
Sort of thing
that might happen
if someone puts a plastic bag
over your head?
Precisely.
We just got our third green.
Do tell. You also studied
the X-rays of my client's wrist.
What did you conclude
from those?
Mrs. Thomas had a sprain
to the ulnar aspect
of her forearm,
which is
almost always indicative
of someone
attempting to block a blow.
It's actually one
of the hallmarks
of a defensive injury.
A defensive injury.
I see.
Now, let's talk about
the victim's injuries.
Peter's lacerations
to the skull.
Now, what we're looking at here
are the injuries
believed to have been caused
by the fire extinguisher.
What can you tell us
about these?Again,
to my eye,
these are defensive injuries
based on the angle
and the speed.
My guess is
that they were delivered
by someone
who was being restrained
in some way.
Say, someone with a plastic bag
over their head?
It's certainly possible.
Objection.
Defense attorney is speculating,
and his expert witness
is swearing to it.
Objection sustained.
Mr. Colón,
I need you to bring this
to some sort of conclusion.
Some sort of conclusion
that isn't speculative.
Of course, Your Honor.
Absolutely, Your Honor.
Now, you keep mentioning...
defensive wounds,
defensive injuries.It all makes a lot more sense
if we think of the accused
as the victim
and her dead husband
as the attacker.
I see.
So...
my client as the victim
and the deceased
as the attacker.
Got it.
Thank you,
Dr. Allendale.
No further questions,
Your Honor.
The defense rests.
I am staring at seven green.
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,
"beyond a reasonable doubt."
That's what the prosecution
told you
when we began this trial,
that they would prove
beyond reasonable doubt
that my client was guilty
of second-degree murder.
Well...
how's this for reasonable doubt?
Their victim
tried to kill my client.
Why?
'Cause she loved him.
She didn't want
the marriage to end.
Even though
he was seeing somebody else,
even though
she could have ended the union
without it costing her a dime.
She loved him.
And she didn't want to live
without him.
Now, I'm guessing
that when he finally broke down
and told her it was over,
she told him that if
he forced her hand,
he'd leave with nothing.
And that's when he decided
his only option was to kill her.
Say she drank too much
and fell overboard
and live happily ever after
with her fortune.
Well, ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,
you cannot convict somebody
for loving their mate too much.
You cannot convict somebody
for defending themselves
after they've been attacked.
And you cannot convict somebody
for not remembering any of it.
None of these
things are a crime.
Thank you for your patience.
We are relying
on your good judgment.
Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,
that concludes the testimony.
The court officer
will escort youWe have nine greens, Bull.
to the jury room,
where you will beginNine greens.
your deliberations.
Rachel,
I have been doing this
a very long time.
And while I've made it policy
not to speculate about verdicts
before juries actually
announce them,
I would be stunned
if you weren't
found not guilty.
That's wonderful news, Dr. Bull.
It's an incredible relief.
Thank you.
I...
I can't wait to go home
and tell Peter.
Knock, knock, knock.
We don't want any.
I think you might
have missed this today.
The business section.
Big article
about Rachel retiring,
moving to London,
donating a ton of money
to Alzheimer's research.
Hmm.I wonder wherever
she got that idea.
Who'd have thunk it?
I like what she says
about owning your own destiny,
not letting it own you.
She said that?
Mm.
It's right there.
Oh.
You're right.
That is brilliant.
Wish I could
come up with stuff like that.
Okay,
don't make me listen to this.
You mind if I leave?Sure thing.
Own your own destiny.
See if I care.
