And maybe blow up
the whole house, ma.
Your own son, your own
flesh and blood, ma?
ls that what you're trying
to do? Your own son?
Why do you always gotta
play games with my head?

Why are you so hard

They hook you up with an
apartment, with a shrink.
Which is fine, you know,
it's great. lt's just...
Money is never what l really

That's pretty much
all l ever get.
Why don't you get
away from them?
How am l going to do that?

What about your clothes?
Your sketches are great.
Open up a store.

You know something?
What?
l always thought you are...
...the most beautiful
girl l've ever seen.
Really?
Ever since l first saw you.
That's nice, Harry.
That really makes
me feel good.
You know, other people
have told me that before...
...and it was meaningless.
Why?
Because you thought they
were pulling your leg?
No, no nothing like that.
l don't know.
l don't know or even
care if they were.
lt just...
...it was meaningless.
You know?
When you say it...
...l hear it.
l really hear it.
Somebody like you could really
make things alright for me.
You think?
What is it?
Remember when l told
you about the store?
Yeah.
l've been thinking
about it a lot.
l put together some
numbers and it's...
...it's not impossible.
l mean...
...you know, you could do.
You should do it.
l mean we could
do it together.
What do you think?
Stop already.
l felt better in a red
dress than a cheese danish.
Three things is aII I
did to change my Iife:
Three things,
No red meat,
Think about it, What do
they stick in red meat?
I ate red meat,,,
,,, to the point where I wouId
eat it sIab right off, raw,
I turned it around,
You need to be passionate,
No red meat,
No red meat for 30 days,
No red meat!
Ada told us. lt's gorgeous.
We're going to make it
a little darker tomorrow.
Why darker?
To go with my red dress.
Yeah, but now it's
looking like Madonna.
This is not Madonna.
And neither is this. But
soon... l'm going on a diet.
-What diet are you on?
-Eggs and grapefruit.
l was on that once.
Lots of luck.
lt's not so bad.
-How long you been on it?
-All day.
All day? lt's one o'clock.
-l'm thinking thin.
-She's thinking thin.
My Louise, she lost fifty
pounds just like that.
-Like that?
-Like what?
What did you do, put
her in a sweat box?
She went to a doctor.
He gave her pills.
-You don't want to eat.
-What's so good about that?
l'm sitting here not thinking
about pastrami on rye?
You really shouldn't talk like
that when someone's on a diet.
Oh, big deal.
l'll sneak another
wedge of grapefruit.
l'm thinking thin.
Oh Sara, the mailman...
Sara Goldfarb?
You have something

to jive you, jim.

And you should see
my Harry on television.
We're giving the prizes away.

Come on in.
What's your name?
Marion.
Well what do you know.
Maid Marion.
l'm Little John.
You have a beautiful view...
What l like best about patty
chicks is they give good head.
Black broads don't know
nothing about no head.
l don't know why.
Maybe it has something
to do with some ancient...
...tribal custom.
Better save some
of that energy.
l know it's purty baby...
...but l didn't take
it out for air.
l told you to stay
away from that arm.
l gotta call Marion, man.
Well it's about to be a
long distance call now.
That's six hundred miles.
Man, we are six hundred
miles closer to Miami.
Yeah. We're also six hundred
miles further away...
...from New York, Ty.
You know, l know where
you could pick up...
...a real nice taste.
Sunday night we're throwing
a little gathering.
All good people.
l can't. l'm busy.
Anyway, l'm not
really hooked.
Yeah, l know. But l'm tellin'
ya', it's a real nice taste.
l'll see you Sunday,
Maid Marion.
Okay Mrs. Goldfarb. Just try
and answer my questions, okay.
When did you start
taking the pills?
The summer.
You started in the summer.
Last summer?
l got the best
place in the sun.
-Okay.
-Ada fixed my hair.
Everything's going to be
alright, Mrs. Goldfarb.
We'll get you all
fixed up in no time.
You're okay. You're okay.
l can't cut it, man. l gotta
do something about this arm.
Let's see what it looks like.
Oh man.
That's the ugliest mothafucka'
l've ever seen.

jack all night long.

Sit at my blackjack table.
