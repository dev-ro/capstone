Vic ! Phone !
Come quickly. Hurry up.
Alo ? Poupette ! Where are you ?
At the Salzburg's festival. 
Playing ?
No not this year. I've come
to hear one student.
And because of
Mozart at the same time.
Any you how are you ?
Terrible.
It's a cute family.
But I have to drive 20 km
every day for my classes.
It's a desert here !
I've even read "L'Education sentimentale".
Come join me here
and we'll come back to Paris together.
I should be staying 6 more days.
And what am I going to say ?
Oh that...! Uf...
Your 85 year old grand grandmother
is on her deathbed!
You are crazy...
The son of Dracula
and Jean-Jacques Rousseau-a.
Yes exactly.
And you and Jean-Louis ?
He'll pick me
at the station.
His wife is on therapy.
I should have told my parents.
They expect me on Sunday.
They'll be pleased
when they see you...
Oh sorry!
Never mind.
But...
Passports.
Passport please.
Can you believe it's been a year
since I've had a boyfriend.
Wait let me see 
if you have changed the meaning.
Dated
or kissed?
Passport please.
-Dated.
Thank you.
I mean had a relationship.
In Paris at the gymnasium at parties...
Always the same faces.
If I don't meet someone on holidays
I won't meet ever.
A good one obviously
16 years. A lot of debils around.
Thank you.
It's funny but I have a feeling
that I'll never fall in love again.
How old are you 15?
And 3 months.
It's only an impression then.
Can you see him ?
No but there's the mother !
Mamma mamma!
What are you doing here?
And you ?
Where is Jean-Louis ?
He couldn't come.
Something happened to gym.
 Jean-Louis?
His wife died.
Damn.
He is so grown-up.
How's the dad ?
We don't see each other a lot
while he's working on his thesis.
He won't be happy.
I was really bored...
What's the matter with you ?
Not feeling well ?
Strange I fell like I've lost a friend.
You never knew her.
That's correct. It's good news.
No more hiding you can get married.
Easy !
You can't just do it after 44 years of hiding
I am off. If you are going out
leave Luke at Mrs Monnet.
Ok ciao mamma.
Ciao.
Vic.
You've grown-up.
Not nice but great. Like you are.
You call your friends and I call mine.

Thibault met on my last day.
It happened only once?
Twice same evening.
How long did it last?
3-4 minutes.
Ah really?
But each time.
So you have not spent whole night with him?

And how do you feel now?
I am on seventh heaven.
Good if he was nice.
Two student ones.
The structure is in place.
So I have a green light?
Oh yes.
The microscope will sing ''La Walkyrie''.
Look Etienne.
Let me see.
That's excellent !
Good let's get some sleep

I'll stay and check if it changes in couple of hours.
Staying with me?
It's already seven o'clock. Have to go.
I've promised something to Françoise.
Make me three intervals.
Done. Finished!
Wait.
François will drive me.
François is coming ?
You coming with Béatrice ?
No...
Never mind François
is welcomed.
No but there is some seafood.
Pénélope is traveling tomorrow with her dad.
We won't meet and we have
so much to talk about.
Can I sleep over here?
And I have a lot to talk about.
See you tomorrow.
Ok. Love you.
Me too.
-Alo ?
Excuse me ?
Ah !
Ok I'll try to explain them.
Don't you have a picture/
Yes but they are getting developed.
I went to the movies three times.
I don't have any money left.
I think I've got 50F left. I'll lend you if you want.
Great. Want some more toast?
It was your father. Could not hear him properly.
We are not going?
He is busy in Istanbul.
I don't mind but Samantha will be mad.
She was a bore before but after
the divorce she is an outstanding one.
I am going to the agency.
Explain to her.
Her bus is coming in the afternoon.
And the nervous breakdown?
Yes ok. See you girls.
See you.
Regarding dad...
It must be true.
Ok are we going to get the photos? 
 Wait.
Hope you did not lose your valet ?
No the money is in my passport.
I am sure I had it...
What is this ?
What?
Look.
He's so cute.
Who's that?
No idea.
How was at the vacation?
Phenomenal!
If it weren't for that fool I would stay longer.
Look he is going to Germany for good.
Wait printing Berthier.
It's here.
''Get It Together''
That's it?
Well yes.
Philippe Berthier ?
Is it here?
Yes.
Good day.
Hello.
Hello.
Are you the one..
..from the train?
Yes.
Hope you have mine ?
No kidding ?
Catherine can you please take
a passport out of my bag.
I am Fredo.
Pénélope.
Ah !
-Cook Da Books love then.
-Went to the concert?
No but wish I had.
Victoire Beretton.
Please Vic.
Let me see.
Training boxing ?
Yes.
Me too.
Really? Where ?
-Well...
At Cité Universitaire.
Shall we have a drink ?
Ok.
We have cold beer and hot coffee.
Well...
No thanks. Ciao.
Ciao.
Ok ciao. 
Ciao.
Ciao.
There your 50F.
Have you seen how he was watching me?
You think she is with him? 
Or with the other one?
Training boxing?
No but I will.
Martineau told you I am ready?
You've been dealing for two years
with those questions.
It is time to get over that.
So? I have your permission?
Do I ?
Yes.
Your dissertation? When is it?
Well...in two months.
Leave the filling and
welcome among the lunatics.
Thanks.
Is that porn !
Well I don't know...
Yes bomb can explode then...
Got two tickets Baryshnikov.
Baryshnikov ?
Yes.
Is that on Saturday ?
Yes.
That's it! See you.
I know your legs - they are beautiful.
Yes but you are not looking at them anymore.
You are not looking at me anymore.
That's not true. I am and you are beautiful.
But...
The reason I was not looking is because
I am preoccupied with something...
I've brought you here because
it is a tradition in our family to eat spaghetti.
when serious things are happening.
So...
I am leaving the practice.
Spaghetti al vongole?
Researching...
And nothing else.
That's phenomenal.
You know what that means.
Caries earns much more than mice.
Because it does not pay off.
I don't understand - are we going to be broke?
If this cartoon I am working on succeeds 
We'll have a lot of money.
By the way the title is:
''39 moles''.
All the money I earn
on my moles...
you can spend on your mice.
Bon bah...
Maybe it is not right time to tell you...
but my travel pass is more expensive.
I need more allowance.
It is better.
I'll tell you.
..for a friend. He has a red glove.
Actually searching for someone to go
with me watching one Kurosawa movie.
Like Japanese movies?
They cry all the time. Makes me depressed.
I do. 
Ok.
I am leaving you.
What time?
Tell me your friend Vic...
Can you give me her number? 
Yes.
Who.
Philippe Berthier.
Yes.
I met Pénélope.
Cook have a concert on 27th November.
Oh love them!
At Baltard-u. Can you come ?
How many tickets do you have ?
Can I take Penelope ?
I waited three hours in a queue
and got last two tickets.
I have to ask...
It sounds ok. Call me?
Ok. Ciao.
You can go. I don't care.
Love that's a miracle.
Èudo.
Love I barely know him.
And Pénélope...
Like him? 
Yes maybe.
Actually I still don't know. I wonder...
If you do that means you like him.
Regarding Jean-Louis - I was not sure.
3 months he brought me roses
6 months orchids.
I was at the opera
And one day there was no flowers.
Though I'll go crazy.
I knew that day.
Look Rose Beuret.
One of my inspirations
She lived for 50 years with Rodin
and they were not married.
Did you go to his wife's funeral?
At my age funerals are frequent.
If I were to go it would be once a month.
She's so beautiful.
That's me.
What?
You posed ?
He lived on the 1st floor.
I was 16. I had legs...
They are still talking about them.
The ones that are still alive.
What' his name?
Philippe.
Is he with Pénélope ?
No.
Was he onto her ?
No.
Well then go out with him.
If she is angry then she's a fool.
Write a comment on this 
quote from Romain Gary.
"Patriotism. 
That is love towards your own."
"Nationalism. 
That is hate towards others."
There.
Do it for Friday.
Listen Pénélope.
If you are making a scene I will cancel it.
But stop ignoring me.
She can be like that for a long time.
with the highest grade
That includes prize for your thesis
and money to finance
You were clear brilliant. With enthusiasm.
I even understood couple of things.
What?
Which one was Portal ?
The one that asked about collagen.
He came all the way from Lion.
Your thesis. Excellent.
Your daughter - impressive.
Congratulations.
Thérèse
our new apprentice.
The dean has forgotten his speech.
Knowledge learning and tatata...
Phenomenal.
Thanks.
Bravo.
Good day.
There are some other things
beside the mice in that lab.
Jealous?
No cautious.
Excuse me let me introduce you to Mr Portal.
Sorry darling.
You work helped me a lot.
Our meeting in Grenoble was crucial.
I'll use this opportunity...
Your results in criofracture
are especially interesting to me
If you come to Lyon...
Well...yes.
Let me introduce my wife.
Mme Beretton.
Madame.
Professor Portal.
Don't forget.
Knowledge and learning.
Cheers.
No it's ok.
One hot-dog please.
Coming.
''Get lt Together'' i love that.
Two hot-dogs one Canada Dry. 29.
Ah but...
Yes two are not coming?
Jean-Batiste and Claudine 
is it serious?
He's stuck....
with his dissertation.
You are over the top. She likes
being married for Einstein.
She works in a travel agency and
has free travels.
Einstein refuses to travel with her for last two years.
-Françoise ?
Hello how are you?
Good and you?
My husband.
Claude Varret.
Good afternoon. How are you?
We should meet.
Ok.
Who's that?
I did an ad for him. For Camembert.
Jealous?
Well...no.
Cautious.
By the way Vic...
Real beauty.
What do you do to watch over her?
Nothing really. She's calmer
than she user to be.
''Get It Together''
With people around
True love is so hard to find now
You think you're so misunderstood
l'd explain if only l could
Something tells me
This time it's real
The way that l feel
Let me see.
I prefer the one
in the passport.
You look
like a Chinese.
Sister of Isabelle Adjani...
..Confucius.
And you are doing that?
I hear that all the time
from my granny.
That is from my mother. She finds
all the time who resembles whom.
She is in Stuttgart.
That's why you go to Germany often.
How do you know?
Ah from the passport?
If I told you I am 2 years older
I would look like a
fool. 
So...
Since you know all about me
Not all no.
There are vacant spots. Let's sit.
Come on. Dive into the dark secrets of my life.
Catherine who is she ?
A friend.
A friend-friend ?
Or a friend... ?
Let me tell you I don't believe in a
boy-girl friendship
Ah so !
I do.
Don't count on me.
But this is no Vincennes.
No Val de Fontenay.
Vincennes
that's opposite direction.
Èekaj.
Let me see.
Because I was happy.
And I did not want to return.
Despite knowing that you will be
worried and be angry at me.
We'll se tomorrow.
Bugger off.
C'mon bugger off.
The problems are beginning.
Why what happened?
She is happy
-Vic !
I met a guy.
-Really?
My mother's son-in-law nephew
Is taking me to a fair on Sunday.
And you? Tell me.
Grounded till Christmas. I've returned after 3.
Was it a ''Love Story'' ?
More like ''Singing in The Rain''.
Shit Stéphane !
Did it on Saturday.
What happened.
I waited for you.
You did not tell him?
I should have called myself.
Really?
-Well...
236-41 -94
I called at least 10 times.
Really?
96 not 94.
So that's the problem.
Let's move we've got a class.
Some other time?
Ok sorry.
You are right.
And my harps? She has no space for them.
Live at your place?
-No.
At my place is only at my place.
-I have a feeling you don't want to get married.
"Marriage is an art where two make problems
they never had while being alone."
Sacha Guitry
or Tristan Bernard.
And your parents how are they?
They can join a competition in stress.
That wasn't in your time.
They are going on each other nerves.
I should go.
I am playing in Gaveau at 7.
One more thing
I want to tell you something.
Regarding...
Remember.
We should be ecstatic or miserable. No middle ground.
So...
Don't rush.
You actually called me?
Going to Angoulême tomorrow.
Why is that?
We got l'Alfred.
That's phenomenal.
Must run.
Going for Japanese and have lunch at Corinto.
How come at Corinto ?
Yes they wany Italian food and...
So you are...
Don't be angry.
What is the matter?
Corinto that's our place !
And why are you taking Japanese
to eat Italian food?
You act like a child.
Nothing to do with it.
Ok listen.
If you don't understand does not matter.
You are right
Love you.
-Love you too.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
My husband
Mr Toshiko Suzika...
..Mr Fumi Ataki.
Ok let's go now.
You are crazy. Where are we going?
-TO Africa flight is at 4.
We only have time to pack-up and hop we are off...
And Lyon ?
Lyon will survive moles too.
And you too.
Come on. This is a kidnap.
Never told me
-Was not planned.
So completely alone?
Actually my little brother is here and a babysitter.
Oh !
Punch him!
Higher !
Watch out don't close  !
Not in the changing room ?
Know each other?
Catherine Vic.
Cheers.
-Cheers.
Come on !
Come on !
Seen that punch?
Lopez has great technique.
Move your turn.
Ok going.
End of fight.
Match in super-light category between Hollandais..
..Suen Bergen.
He'll surely win.
and Philippe Berthier
from C.S.U.
Ten!
Doctor Suen Bergen..
..Winner.
If it is about Back Street game 
we already had that in the family
He does not miss me much?
He is in great shape the little one too. She's here.
Mme Monnet ?
No problems with Vic in the evening ?
Not at all. The little one gets asleep.
Then I come down to my place. They can always call me.
But they are so quiet
I'll give her to you. See you.
Mum ?
Vic.
-Was it worth going?
Can't imagine
I feel like being your age.
That's not always good.
You are not ok? - I am.
Seen Poupette ?
On tour south-west.
And Philippe ?
At the hospital.
Got injured while boxing. 
-Nothing serious?
No but is a bummer.
He'll lose finale.
Any messages for me? -No.
Actually yes. Gilles called. Wait.
Mr Van der Bauer is coming on Friday.
Friday you say?
Who is that?
A producer from Belgium.
And proteoglikoli ?
I've found the parts.
See you are ready for the experiment.
We can wait until Friday but after that is a risk.
Start without me.
-We worked together for months and now...
Not the first time you seduce one
and I finish her.
Very funny.
Listen...
Till Saturday.
-Ok ok.
That's not true. Your liar.
But...
It's hot tonight
That's a breeze.
It will be a storm on Thursday.
Ah really?
-The janitor told me.
They know that - the camels get temperature.
Thursday?
Yes.
We still have 6 days of nice weather.
Tell me Abib is it finished with nice weather?
It's always nice here.
Rain falls once a year.
Thanks Abib.
He does not know anything.
He's from north.
But I haven't talked about rain.
You meant desert storm?
Exactly - that is hell.
Sand covers everything - houses eyes....
Especially light coloured eyes like that
You always get conjunctivitis
Pouf like that1
All the flights are canceled.
You talked to lab?
Yes I did.
Maybe the microscope is singing
"Return to me"?
To be frank
We can catch a plane on Thursday
Yes there is one flight
404 at 16:40
How come you are so informed?
Van der Bauer comes to Paris on Friday
What a fool I am.
I've escaped from the hospital.
And your nose and concussion?
You are my concussion. I must see you.
You escaped to see me?
Pénélope gave me flowers.
Please I'll go insane.
Is that true ?
I am here with Fredo.
There is a party at Cité.
Want to join me?
The thing is...
Vic... I love you.
Take the keys. Come one kidnup it and
none will know.
Ok.
One thing... 
-Yes?
If he cries play him Aznavour.
Love me?
Oh !
Mme Fontanet ?
Vic's father.
She's not here? Who is after her?
Vic's father. Is that Penelope?
Samantha.
You want to talk to Pénélope ?
Yes quick.
She is out with mum.
Yes were at Africa? Must have been great.
Yes it was good. Do you know where Vic is?
No why? She's not there?
Thanks. So long.
Mme Monnet left at 9 as usual
A Pénélope ?
Pff !
Before what?
While I still trusted you.\
Vic are you insane?
You are irresponsible
Wonder in the middle of the night.
Not like I left him at a church's entrance.
What happened
I was with Philippe.
He is out of hospital?
I haven't slept with him.
That's what interests you?
That's not the only thing the interests us
There is a question of trust.
You are not permitted to go out on weekdays
or when having classes
And you used your chance
-The other days...
We even don't want to hear
what happened on other days
And I have to finish university
to achieve that
Achieve what?
To be able to enjoy 8 days of holiday
To return earlier instead.
Because one of the mice is sick?
-Vic !
I apologize
Did not want to say that.
You preach me and you are not
interested what I was doing
and what is on my heart
And why I am confused
I put Luke a cap and
gave an orange juice.
And come for him
You did not break up?
I did not say that. He is with you
are you sleeping or breaking up?
Yes.
Ciao !
-Ciao champion.
Nice from you to come.
No more training so...
Coffee? 
-Yes.
5 coffees please.
Did you make your homework?
No Jolivet will kill me.
You are senior?
-Yes at Montaigne
Did you come home ok?
No problem. You found the keys?
Yes. Shall I make a duplicate?
Ciao.
Guess whom I just met.
We are not at an exam. Tell us.
Mathieu.
-Really? Where?
He has returned?
-We've been at Mabillon.
Three of us made 50F.
We have just cleaned windows for pennies.
Who's coming on a motorcycle?
Mathieu.
Super isn't it ?
He asked about
...some...
and friends
Having a party in a month.
Even called me.
You'll se he's really nice.
Why would I? I am not invited.
I am and I am not going without you.
You'll never guess who is in Paris.

Well...yes.
Ciao. Come in.
Ciao. Penelope!
How are you?
-Good.
Didier Mathieu.
Good evening. 
-Glad to meet you.
Hello.
Samantha !
Patrick. Ciao.
No I would like to be a manager.
And you?
Have no idea.
I don't want to be a nurse
at a city hospital.
Try this.
Ciao
Ciao
Who is this?
I went out with him 2 years ago
Anything else you did?
Dance?
Yes
You mean beside motorcycle accidents
drugs rockets fools
There you are. Bon appetite. 
-Thanks
Look Vic.
Oh I can't believe it.
You are super.
Let me see.
You put this.
And you can use this.
And a mini skirt.
You won't put that on?
Light on the fifth.
My cat is on your balcony. Haven't you heard it?
Who's that?
One gentleman searching for his cat.
It is urgent.
4:20 minutes
Oh yes.
Come to see.
5:20 minutes
Let's go. That's at St-Denis.
Yes.
Quiet.
I am measuring the time.
Shall I pass via Sébastopol ?
1 minute.
First left then second on the right.
Oh you are new here ?
No.
How old are you ?
18.
Stop !
Police. Your documents.
I'll beat you up !
What have you done? Come here.
It is finished now.

-That was only a game.
Dispatch here please speak
Get inside !
Stop!
-Into the taxi!
But I won't call.
-Ah of course not!
Wine?
Why wouldn't girl call first ?
Because the more we do that
the less they do it.
Good day Jacques.
-Oh good day.
I just wanted to call you. Are you free?
Thursday 15th?
I am getting married.
Married ?
All the best then.
You agreed ?
Yes.
It's late I...
Don't worry I knew you'd forget.
But I...
Duck in a jelly
Champagne. Chocolate mousse.
Want to take e bath ?
No. Last year I was still able
to button it up.
We need an editor mixer...
operator two animators
That many?
Animated movie requires a team work.
Ah...
How long are you going to work on it?
If we make a movie
two years at least
And you at the laboratory?
It's ok.
Compared to the work
Portal does in Lyon
Paris is still the research centre.
Don't be so sure.
There are faculties in the province.
It's phenomenal what they do.
And the quality of life is a plus.
There are a lot of people attracted to that.
House with a garden fresh air
a view to Rhone.
See...
-And we have Seine here.
Portal offered me to work with him.
Not at Lyon?
Yes.
-Out of the question.
Yes it might do.
You agreed?
Not before I talk to you but...
it might do
For how long?
-Well just a year ot two
A year...or two.
And my movie?
With TGV it is only 2:40 hours to Paris.
I could did it. And you?
What about me?
You can't use TGV ?
It's not the same.
It's a team work
We have a day and a half
to decide.
If I were to go to Bruxelles
to work with Van der Bauer..
would you go with me?
Well...
Of course!
Shall I drive you?
No I...
So ?
Yes.
Of course
For you to abandon Paris
friends really...
You know...
I always believed in
that proverb
When the parent are happy
the children are happy too
Are you happy?
You know very well
I can't live without her
Remember what happened two
years ago.
Our divorce was unsuccessful
wasn't it?
Don't move. There.
How did you know...
you want to be together.
You know it is not hard to know.
But it is hard to say.
It is.
No we are going to Evreux to see
Bernard and Gilberte
There for you.
Did you go for Luke?
Yes. At Bernard's and Gilberte...
Listen every time your
grandfather calls us
He is boring even Poupette is.
And that's her son.
Staphane invited me on Saturday
to "Boris Godunov" opera.
You'll love it.
Yes but it is on Saturday.
You'll call?
Who is Felix Marechal?
Oh...well...
Ah.
Alo?
-Vid it's Felix
Am I still available on Saturday?
You know who felix is? -No.
It's a man! He sounds like a man!
Yes yes.
-Is there a problem?
No not at all. Ciao.
How old is that Felix?
Well...21. -Oh!
Boris Godounov am I going or not ?
You did not uncover me?
They believed you?
You know...Staphane opera...
Yes total anesthesia.
Can you call Stephane?
It's been engaged for two hours.
And Philippe ?
Dating Lydia.
-That's a bed news.
It'll last for 2 days knowing Lydia.
How old do I look?
What are we going to talk about?
Engaged.
I've never had a dinner with a boyfriend alone.
If he is clever don't agree with him all the time.
He'll conquer you.
If he's in idiot agree with
him the time will pass faster.
Don't like it?
You are so beautiful.
Ah that's him!
Open the door and tell
me how's he dressed.
Good evening.
Good evening Madame.
-Please enter.
I am Vic's grandmother.
Actually grand-grandmother.
But that's too long.
My granddaughter will be here soon.
He's got jeans. From here to here.
Know it.
I'll look like a fool.
Good evening.
-Ciao.
You can stay till midnight?
Are we going to ear oysters?
Let's go!
Good evening Madame.
You are Stephane?
Yes.
-Aha
We were worried about you.
Separation of burgoise education
and masters lead directly into
unemployment. Intellectuals...
Like oysters?
Yes yes.
You are on final?
No the second.
Oh how old are you?
16
You look like
having fun at 8 in the morning.
Waitress :
''A bloody steak sir ?
''And what about
some fucking potatoes?''
"Every morning I have a bath
she enters"
"And sinks my ships..."
I make the mankind laugh.
That's important too.
More important to me
than a Nobel prize.
I respect a lot that you...
I did not say anything.
But you think! The whole world thinks!
You men think it is normal for a woman
to leave everything because of her husband.
But he would never do that for her.
Ok than we are not going.
And I even have to decide?
I can be a victim or an executioner.
Not fair!
Really not fair!
I have to get dressed
for my grandmother's wedding.
Don't make a face
you are not marrying your daughter.
I am going Poupette.
Yes of course you will
A sailor without a sea is always grumpy.
We can forgive everything to ourselves
except the things we haven't done
And Vic and Lucas ?
Lucas is small
Vic is big.
She's the one who...
I don't want to lose Francoise.
Pensioners discount !
That does not suit you?
Buy a children discount!
She's incredible!
Are you nervous?
Believe me to live separated
while being in love...
You'll meet half way through/
Your hearts will beat.
You'll sleep in lousy hotels.
Or trailers.
You'll part
with tears in your eyes in the morning.
at a restaurant in a train station
You'll board your train.
And she'll board hers.
You have fond memories?
You think I am making a stupid mistake?
And we don't know why
So why?
You have a date
To whom are you angry?
To your father because he wants to leave?
To mw because I am busy
and not sacrificing?
What's the decision?
Packing all up and going?
Not decided yet.
But you...
Oh
Ja.
Here or there...
Ah is it?
Some time ago you would be
desperate to leave
Actually to leave him.
-How do you know?
You don't talk to me anymore
so I have to guess
Good day Stephane.
Good day. Is Vic here? -No.
I promised this disk.
Boris Godunov....
Yes she like it very much
Oh really?
Thanks. Is that for her too?
Well...yes.
I'll give it to her. Goodbye.
Goodbye
Who was that?
-Staphane. I told her you are away.
He brought this for you.
Poor Stephane.
He is suffering.
I know but...
We are too.
Have to go.
I have an exam on the 1st.
A or B
The rest...
I don't care
Congratulations
You too.
It's nice to change
at your age.
Its really nice to love your work.
And your mother is like that.
In her work.
She's lucky.
Listen I am not going to Terre Adelie.
Where is that ?
Ok to South Pole.
Every other weekend.
If it suits your private life
come and see your father.
My private life currently is Terre Adelie.
When are you leaving ?
Straight away.
Going for my mother.
Samantha and your tender ?
Isn't it today?-It's now.
Dad promised to drive her.
5 years she is trying to enter Opera
because one day he told her he's in love.
with "Swan Lake"
-He did not come.
One hotel
had a fire in Bogotá.
-That is correct but she does not want
to hear about it
-Samantha !
Samantha.
Ok that will make the father angry.
But that is your life
What are you throwing away?
There was no beef I took turkey.
Hurry up. Thanks.
Hvala.
Vic.
Don't forget this.
Thanks.
I won't see you tonight.
I love you.
Ciao.
with children.
-Ok.
Maybe you will
in September
You know well.
Maybe the Belgian will fail.
He sells beer.
Ah ok.
Ok. Ah...
I forgot.
Under the raincoat you have
your blue skirt
and white blouse I gave you for Christmas
new blue sandals
And here...
some moles
none can see.
Besides me when...
Is this your car?
You can't park it here.
Miss Fontanet.
That's my sister.
Wait.
Yes now I am dating Fredo.
No kidding?
Have you slept with him?
No it is serious this time.
Looks like
You can't stand here.
What did Fredo say?
Philippe has passed the exams
Travels to his mother tonight.
What's that?
A letter from Stephane. I haven't open it.
Wait. There is something inside.
Let me see.
THE END
