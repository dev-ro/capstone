No, thank you.
Thank you.
No, that's quite sufficient.
Thanks.
- Salt?
- Thank you.
What exactly is he doing now?
He's on leave, actually.
On vacation.
Oh. Well, perhaps someone
might get in touch with him.
Oh, yes, certainly.
No difficulty about that.
- Got him to pop over to Berlin.
- Mmm, I think so.
Good.
- Shame about K.L.J.
- Mmm.
- How was he killed?
- Shot.
- What gun?
- Long shot in the spine, actually- 9.3.
- Same as Metzler.
- Oh, really?
- How's your lunch?
- Rather good.
- What is it?
- Pheasant.
- Oh, that should be rather good. Is it?
- It is, rather. Yes.
Excuse me. Do you have a light?
Certainly.
- Do you smoke this brand?
- No, I don't think I know that brand.
Perhaps I might
introduce it to you.
Thank you.
- Ever been here before?
- No.
Impressive, isn't it?
Built by Werner in 1936
for the Olympics.
It holds 100,000 people.
Certain well-known personalities
used to stand right up there.
Must've been quite noisy...
100,000 people all cheering,
wouldn't you say?
Yes, quite noisy.
- Some leberwurst?
- No, thanks.
Or some schinken? Oh, wait a moment.
What am I talking about?
This isn't schinken. It's knackwurst.
What about some knackwurst?
- I'm not hungry.
- Aren't you? Oh, I am.
Oh, you won't mind
if I eat while we, uh, walk?
What do you want?
- You've been on holiday, I understand.
- I am on holiday.
By the sea?
What do you want?
- Oh, my name's Pol, by the way.
- What?
P-O-L. Pol.
- Mine's Quiller.
- Oh, I know that.
I'm told you've been working
in the Middle East for some time.
Yes, I've been working there.
We've been engaged in some
rather tough work here.
I think we're coping well with the situation
in other parts of the country...
but it's getting a bit
out of hand in Berlin.
Quite a tough bunch.
Nazi from top to toe.
In the classic tradition.
But not just the remains
of the old lot. Oh, no.
There's quite a bit
of new blood. Youth.
Firm believers.
Very dangerous.
It wouldn't do
to underestimate them.
Oh, quite complex,
of course, the overall, uh-
Difficult to pinpoint.
Nobody wears
a brown shirt now, you see.
No banners.
Consequently, they are
difficult to recognize.
They look like everybody else.
They move in various walks of life.
But they're very careful
and quite clever.
And they look like everybody else.
Intriguing, don't you think?
Oh, however, I agree with you.
I mean, that's all politics. Not our job.
I'll tell you what our job is.
Our job is to get to the hard core,
the extreme element...
the ones you can recognize,
if you get close enough to see them.
They have a base here,
but we don't know where it is.
We need rather urgently
to find it.
I've read the files.
- You read them while you were in London, did you?
- That's right.
Who was our leading operator here
in the last file you saw?
- Metzler.
- He's dead.
Another colleague of yours
took over from him.
- Kenneth Lindsay Jones.
- Mm-hmm.
He's dead too.
He was killed two days ago-
long range 9.3 in the spine.
We'd like you to take over.
Oh, he was obstinate.
He refused cover.
If he'd allowed us to give him cover,
he might not be dead...
and we might have a better idea
of how far he'd got.
He was justified in using
any method he thought fit.
Not a very efficient method,
in his case.
What do you know about it?
You only talk to people.
This is a very strong operation,
fully urgent.
They've killed two of our men.
We want you to take over from Jones.
Oh, I've been asked to say
that this is not an order, but a request.
Consider it, will you?
At your leisure.
I'll give you five minutes.
Perhaps you'll join me
in Section "E" at 11:26.
Bitte?
I'd like a double Jack Daniel's
on the rocks. Do you have it?
Jack Daniel's, double?
Would you like to see
the evening paper?
Do you smoke this brand?
No, I don't think
I know that brand.
Perhaps I might
introduce it to you.
Would you say they're milder
than other brands?
They're milder than
some other brands.
Okay, I'll try one.
I lost you.
Why?
Were you following me?
You were playing a game with me.
I didn't appreciate it.
Oh, come on.
Don't be silly.
You might have been one
of the adverse party.
- They don't know you are here... yet.
- You don't think so?
- No. I am one of your cover.
- Hi.
I would like to ask what methods
you intend to employ.
Well-
Same again!
I'll tell you. If you say they don't know I'm here,
I think I'd better let them know I'm here.
- Otherwise, how are we ever gonna get together?
- I see. That's your business.
The fact is, I've been asked to give you
certain fragments of information...
to do with some
of K.L.J.'s movements.
We have no idea
whether it's of any value.
- What's your name?
- Hengel.
Why are you so tense, Hengel?
- Are you being funny?
- Look at your hand. It's so tight.
Look at your skin.
Your skin's terrible.
I don't think you get
enough exercise.
I have a feeling, Mr. Quiller...
that you won't find life here
so funny for very long.
- Why don't you drink your beer?
- I don't want it.
- I bought it for you.
- You can't make me want it, Mr. Quiller.
Well, I need a chaser.
- I worked with K.L.J. I knew him.
- Oh, really?
- Did you know him?
- Yes, I did.
If he'd allowed me to stay with him,
I could have saved his life.
- Give me the information.
- What?
You said you had information.
Give it to me.
I'm thinking of starting a big chain
of these places in the States.
- Don't they have quite a few of them already?
- Yes.
Oh, quite a few, quite a few.
Thousands.
But there's always room for a few more.
- Always.
- What kind of business do you do?
Quite good.
We have many regulars.
A friend was telling me about this place.
He was in here a couple of nights ago.
Don't know if you ever met him-
name of Jones.
- Kenneth Lindsay Jones.
- Jones?
No, I don't think so.
I think I could remember the name.
Yes.
- Would you like to bowl?
- No.
Not now, thanks. But maybe
I'll come back another day.
Bye, Mr., uh-
- Weiss.
- Weiss.
- Auf Wiedersehen.
- Auf Wiedersehen.
Sorry.
I don't understand.
- You're not swimming?
- No.
This is for swimming, this place.
I'm a coach,
back in the States.
I teach swimming
in Williamsburg, Virginia.
I heard some of the best swimmers
in Berlin come here.
A friend of mine was telling me.
An Englishman, name of Jones.
This place is for swimming.
You cannot watch.
It is not allowed
to have onlookers.
Oh, what a pity. I hoped
I'd have been able to watch.
No.
Pity.
Well, danke.
My name is Cooper.
I'm a journalist.
I speak English,
I'm afraid, not so very well.
I'm afraid I don't
speak German at all.
How can I help you?
I'm writing an article
for the Philadelphia World Review.
- You haven't heard of it?
- No.
That's because it hasn't started yet.
This is gonna be the first number.
We in Philadelphia are convinced
that current affairs in Europe...
have a great deal of bearing on the lives
of the citizens of Philadelphia.
- You know, the people back home in Philly.
- I don't understand what-
I am collating material for an article
about the Nazi situation in Germany.
- Nazis?
- That's right.
We understand that you had a schoolteacher
here recently, name of Steiner...
who was discovered
to have been a war criminal.
- Is that right?
- That is so.
Well, we'd like a little more information
for our Philly readers.
It was all reported.
I didn't think it was reported
in any great detail.
- The man hanged himself, I believe.
- Hanged?
Yeah, you know.
Oh, hanged. Yes.
I'm so sorry.
My English.
I have a teacher here
who has replaced this man.
She knows English.
Perhaps you would like to speak to her?
Sure. Thanks.
If you will come with me,
I will see if she is still here.
- Fr√§ulein Lindt.
- Ja?
- Good-bye.
- Thank you.
So you're writing an article
about Herr Steiner.
No. No, he's just an item.
The article is about the present-day
Nazi question in Germany.
I don't know much about it myself.
I've been a sportswriter all my life.
Ah.
But you know what boxing
is these days.
No. What?
- The golden days are over. You're not a boxing fan?
- No, I'm not.
Ah. Well, listen.
Uh, this man Steiner, can you
tell me anything about him?
- Not very much, I'm afraid.
- What was he like?
- He was a very good teacher.
- Was he?
Oh, yes.
We were so surprised
when we heard about his past.
We couldn't believe it.
- I mean, he was so wonderful with the children.
- Is that a fact?
Yes. He seemed to feel-
I don't know- a- a great
responsibility towards them.
It's funny how little you know about people,
however closely you work with them.
But I-
What?
I think it is true to say that, at heart,
he was part of the old Germany.
That's quite an interesting angle-
the old Germany and the new Germany.
Yeah, that's quite
an interesting angle.
What would you say were
the aims of the new Germany?
Oh. That's a very big question.
What are your aims?
- Mine?
- As a schoolteacher.
Well, I think perhaps, uh...
to try to teach the children
a broader attitude towards Europe-
a broader attitude
towards the world.
- Mind if I quote that?
- Oh, I'm not an important person really.
- I'm just a schoolteacher.
- But you're a young German woman.
And that's what's gonna interest the readers
back home- the feminine point of view.
We're very interested
in the feminine point of view.
You've been most helpful.
- Do you live near the school?
- No, I live in Wilmersdorf.
- Why don't I give you a lift?
- That's very kind of you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Good luck... with your article.
- Oh, yes, uh-
I might want to reach you again...
about the article.
- Can I call you?
- I'm in school every day.
Good-bye.
Hey, wait a minute.
Uh, that bag looks heavy.
Very heavy.
Why don't I help you carry it?
All right.
The point about Louis
was Louis's coordination.
Louis had wonderful coordination.
He was really-
You know, he was really
of a piece, that guy.
And he had a killer inside him.
- I mean, look what he did to Schmeling.
- Who?
Schmeling. German fighter.
Louis killed him.
I thought Schmeling beat him.
He beat him the first time,
but Louis killed him the second time.
He massacred him.
I don't know what it is, but the Germans
have been a great disappointment.
I mean, from the boxing
point of view.
I mean, you know, you'd think
that the way the German mind goes-
I mean, the old German mind,
not the new German mind-
you'd have thought they'd have done well
in the fight game.
But it hasn't worked out that way.
We've got 'em beat.
- So it seems.
- But that's the way it goes.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
What kind of men do you know?
- I don't know many.
- Why not?
I'm busy.
Someone was telling me
that there are some people...
- who don't think like, for instance, you do.
- How do you mean?
Well, someone was telling me
there are some people here...
who wouldn't agree with your attitude
about Europe, about education.
You know,
about things like that.
Well, that's true, I suppose.
That's what this man
was telling me.
- Yes.
- Do you mean...
there are certain people here who believe
that this country should be very strong-
that it should be dominant?
- That's right.
- They still believe that?
- Oh, yes, still.
- Well, listen.
I don't think there's anything
basically wrong with that, is there?
We believe the same thing in the States.
We believe our country should be strong.
I wouldn't say dominant.
We don't wanna dominate anyone.
But I would say strong.
Yes, I'd say that.
But listen. What kind of people
are they exactly- Nazis?
Well, they are, I would say.
- But, of course, they don't call themselves that anymore.
- They don't?
- No.
- You know, this fits in with what this man was telling me.
He was saying that these boys
don't show themselves...
- that they keep themselves pretty much undercover.
- Yes, so I believe.
Yeah. He was saying they've got
a kind of long-term policy...
that they want to infiltrate themselves into
the mind of the country over a period of years.
- But that they're not in any kind of hurry this time.
- Yes.
But that they're very convinced men-
very convinced.
Yes, I would say that. Yes.
That's exactly what
this man was telling me.
- Who is this man?
- What man?
The man who was talking to you.
Oh. Just a guy
I met in a bar.
Ah.
Are you going to write about this question
in your article?
Oh, no, no. That's outside my range.
I'm not political.
I haven't got a political brain.
- It's very pleasant here.
- Yes, I like it.
Do you like living alone?
I've been alone
for a long time.
My family was killed in the war.
I live for my work now.
- How long are you staying in Berlin?
- Until I finish my assignment.
Why don't we go out
one night?
That would be very nice.
Are you following me?
- Ow! What the hell!
- I am sorry, sir. I do apologize.
- What's your name?
- Graube, sir.
Move over, please.
I'll drive.
- Are you cold?
- What is it, day or night?
My name's Oktober.
What's yours?
- What's the time?
- You've just looked at your watch.
It may be slow or fast.
What time do you make it?
Time isn't really very important.
It is to me.
I have an appointment.
- She looks something like that too, so-
- She'll wait.
Listen. Can I make a suggestion?
Surely. But we would like
to know your name first.
- Let me make the suggestion first.
- No, tell us your name first.
They call me Spike.
- Not your nickname, your surname.
- Canetti.
What is your suggestion?
I think this is a case of mistaken identity.
I work for Doubledays in New York.
I came to Berlin
looking for rare books.
Have you found them?
Well, no, not quite yet.
I haven't found them yet.
What is your real name?
My mother's maiden name
was O'Reilly.
What is your real name,
please, Mr. Quiller?
Originally, I had to walk around with
a double-barreled name- O'Reilly-Canetti-
but I found it a bit heavy.
Wouldn't you find it heavy?
So I dropped the O'Reilly
and kept the Canetti.
- What does your father do, Mr. Quiller?
- He's dead.
- And your mother?
- She's dead too.
- And your sister?
- She's dead too.
What I mean is, I never had one.
I was an only child.
- You must be lonely.
- No, no, no.
You must feel lonely now,
sitting here among strangers.
No, I like meeting people.
You know, new faces.
How's your leg?
My leg? Oh, yes.
Someone scratched it with a suitcase.
He did it.
- Oh, hi. Hello.
- Hello.
- We know a little about you.
- Me?
A little. But we would like
to know a little more.
I shall tell you quite simply.
We would like to know the exact location
of your local control in Berlin.
We would like to know a little more
about your current code system.
We would like to be able to appreciate
the extent of your knowledge about us.
And also, what information,
if any...
your predecessor managed
to pass to your control.
We would like to know
the exact nature...
of your present mission
in Berlin.
You are a sensible man.
You know perfectly well you must give us
this information, since you have no alternative.
Have you got a telephone here?
I think I should call my lawyer in New York.
Guy called Cuspensky.
I'll make it collect,
so don't worry about that.
Yon don't work in New York,
Mr. Quiller.
You work in Europe
and the Middle East.
Take off your coat.
Sure.
My name's Oktober.
What's yours?
- Quiller.
- Ah.
And your first name?
Inge.
Your name is Inge?
Really?
That's a girl's name.
It's the name of a girl.
She must be a very beautiful girl.
Tell us about her.
You're not worried, are you?
There's nothing to be worried about, is there?
- No.
- You can talk to me quite easily, can't you?
- No.
- Of course you can.
You need to relax.
They work you too hard.
That boss of yours, what's his name?
Uh- Uh-What's his name?
- Inge.
- No, she's a girl. She's not your boss.
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes!
Do sit up. You seem to be sleepy.
Don't fall asleep, not yet.
Your friend Jones
hated your boss.
They betrayed him and killed him.
What was his name?
She has long legs.
Oh, really? I'm so glad
to hear that. You're very lucky.
After you leave us, you can go to her.
She's waiting for you.
- White.
- She adores you.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes, adores you.
She wants you only.
- She longs for you only.
- Longs.
Adores me. Wants me-
No, don't sleep.
It's too early.
That was a good sleep you had, huh?
How do you feel?
Great!
- Talk to me.
- Nothing to talk.
Oh, come on, Quiller. We don't want
to keep you here all night.
Your control will be worried about you.
You haven't reported for a long time.
- Don't report. I'm my-
- What?
- I'm my own master.
- But you mustn't lose touch with them.
Why don't you phone them?
Or we can take a message for you.
- What's the address?
- Not waiting.
- Of course they are waiting. Inge's waiting. Who is Inge?
- Who?
- What's her second name? Inge what?
- Who?
- Inge who?
- What?
- Inge what?
- Link- Link-
- Is she your link?
- No link.
- Of course you have a link. She's with your colleagues now.
- No colleagues!
- You have a cover man. What's his name?
- Hang- Hang- Hang him!
- That's unkind. He's your friend. What's his name?
- Jones.
Jones knows Inge.
He's with Inge now.
Dead. With her now.
He's in bed with her now.
- He's enjoying her now. You must tell your base.
- He's dead.
You mustn't let her touch him.
He's a corpse. Where's your base?
Tell us your base.
She's your colleague.
- How does she get signals from local control?
- She's not-
- Where's your base?
- Secret. It's secret.
- Pol doesn't-
- Pol. Who is Pol?
- Pop it in the box.
- Who is Pol?
- Polly. Pol. Good Polly.
- A pet shop? Which pet shop?
Is that where your control is now?
Which pet shop?
In the zoo.
- Who is your cover?
- Getting in my way.
Never out of my way.
Do you smoke this brand?
- What brand?
- Don't know it. Too strong.
- Would you like a cigarette?
- Not right brand.
- What is your favorite brand?
- No smoking. Call the guard.
The next station is Kurf√ºrstendamm.
What number do you want?
- No number.
- Now, don't be silly.
Your control is in Kurf√ºrstendamm.
We know that.
But you must get your message to your chief.
We've lost the number. What is it?
- Too late.
- It's never too late!
They're waiting for you. They're worried.
They want to know where you are!
What is the number?
The number?
- What?
- The church. The churches!
- Where are we?
- In your base.
Don't be stupid, Quiller!
You're not a baby!
- Inge what?
- In- Lie- Lying low.
What's the number of your base?
Three, five, eight-
- Nine, ten, out.
- We've just got a call from your base.
You're ordered to make an immediate report.
Begin your report, Quiller.
Can you hear me?
Begin it!
Do anything.
It won't matter.
No. You've wasted my time.
Inject him.
When he's unconscious, kill him.
- Oh, hello.
- Oh.
- Where are you off to tonight?
- Midsummer Banquet.
Oh, yes.
Who's giving that?
- The lord mayor.
- Oh, yes, of course.
- You've been before, have you?
- Where?
- The lord mayor's midsummer banquet.
- Oh, yes, yes.
Oh. I've never been asked.
- Haven't you? Um, any news from Berlin?
- Not really, no.
Chase them up in the morning.
Find out what's going on.
- Yes, I will.
- I always enjoy the banquet.
It's a very splendid occasion. Ah!
Yes, I'm sure it is.
Bitte?
I'd like a room.
I'd like a pair of shoes.
Matt Monro
with his latest, "Wednesday's Child."
You're listening to Music Through the Night
on A.F.N. Berlin...
the American Forces Network.
- Ja?
- I'm sorry. It's very late.
- Who is this?
- Me, Cooper.
I was in bed.
Did you get out of bed?
No, I'm still there.
What is it? What's the time?
It's so late.
Are you alone?
I'm asleep.
Are you all right?
- I want to see you.
- Not now, I'm afraid.
When then?
Tomorrow, if you like, after school.
Come and have some coffee.
All right. I'll be there.
Good night.
Good night.
He's back.
Do you smoke this brand?
No. No, I don't think
I know that brand.
Perhaps I might
introduce it to you.
All right. All right,
what do you want?
They're milder
than some other brands.
- Yes, I know they are. What do you want?
- Would you like to try one?
Wow. You boys are tough.
- Yes, I'd love to try one. May I, please?
- Certainly.
- Won't you join me?
- I don't smoke.
You don't look too well.
Listen, don't try to be an intellectual.
What do you want?
I've been waiting for you here.
Your car was found abandoned.
We brought it back.
We don't really know
what you're up to.
Uh-huh. I see.
I have to take you
to meet someone.
You do, huh?
Yes, I do.
Did you say something?
I would like some black coffee.
Please.
- I've been to their base.
- Oh, yes?
But I don't know where it is.
- You were sleepwalking.
- I was taken there.
Ah.
- Met a man called Oktober.
- Oh, yes.
- Know him?
- We've never actually met.
At the end of our conversation...
he ordered them to kill me.
- And did they?
- No.
How very odd.
Do you think
they disobeyed him?
I wouldn't think so.
They didn't take-
They didn't take me through
the full course either.
- Didn't want to hurt you unduly, I'm sure.
- They hurt K.L.J.
He got too close.
- I got close.
- You were helpless.
I'm alive, anyway.
Well, that's nice to know.
They wanted to know
where our base was.
And did you tell them?
They obviously think they can find
our base through another method.
Do you know, I think you're right.
But what other method?
I can find their base
by another method.
How? Would you like to tell me?
No.
Oh.
You're on a delicate mission,
Quiller.
Perhaps you're beginning
to appreciate that.
Let me put it this way.
There are two opposing armies
drawn up on the field...
but there's a heavy fog-
they can't see each other.
Oh, they want to,
of course, very much.
You are in the gap
between them.
You can just see us,
you can just see them.
Your mission is
to get near enough...
to see them, to signal
their position to us...
so giving us the advantage.
But if, in signaling
their position to us...
you inadvertently
signal our position to them...
it is they who will gain
a very considerable advantage.
That's where you are, Quiller.
In the gap.
- Did you get to sleep?
- What?
- Did you get to sleep again after I phoned?
- Yes.
Not immediately.
Did you?
Not immediately.
It was a strange time to call.
You seem different.
- Do I?
- Quite.
I've been thinking about you.
How is your article?
The one you were going to write.
Ah. I haven't written it.
Actually, uh...
that wasn't exactly true.
There's no such thing as
the Philadelphia World Review.
For whom are you writing, then?
No one.
I'm not a writer.
What are you?
I'm a kind of investigator.
What do you mean?
I'm investigating those people
we were talking about last time.
"Those people"?
What do you mean?
Those people.
But you said you were a journalist.
I'm not.
Why are you telling me?
I thought you oughta know.
But do you realize
what kind of people they are?
They are ruthless.
They are quite ruthless.
Everyone here knows about them.
They've killed people.
You don't have to worry about me.
I just thought you oughta know,
that's all.
- Do you have a gun?
- No. No.
Why not?
Shouldn't you have one?
If you don't carry a gun, you're less likely
to get yourself killed.
Believe me.
I've missed you.
Shh. Shh.
- I've missed you all the time.
- No, please.
I've been wanting to touch you.
You're so white.
Have you been waiting for me?
Yes.
I know you have.
I'm worried about you,
you know.
A friend of my father's...
has told me about them.
About who?
Those people.
He was with them.
A friend of your father's?
Yes.
I know what they're like.
- He's told me what they are like.
- He knew them, huh?
Yes.
He knew them.
- Where is he, this man?
- What?
Do you know where he is?
Can you reach him?
Yes, I- I think so.
- Why?
- I think I'd like to speak to him.
- But why?
- Just a word.
But I've told you,
he's not with them anymore.
He might be able to help.
He might not want to.
Listen, I want to know
where their base is, you see.
- But he wouldn't know.
- If he was with them, he might know.
Can I see him?
You really want to?
Yes.
All right.
He must be here.
The door was open.
Well, let's wait.
Wanna dance?
No, thank you.
It's so strange being here.
Let's go down
to the deep end.
We could do
an underwater ballet.
Ever done that?
Draft.
What's his name?
Hassler.
- Hassler!
- Don't!
Hassler!
Maybe the bar's open.
Ah!
I had to be late.
- This is the man.
- We've met.
I had to be late.
I had to make some inquiries.
I wanted to give you
this information.
- I'm glad you're someone to do something.
- Uh-huh.
I was checking.
But I have to tell you, they have moved
from the old house.
I don't know the new house.
- I keep away from things, you see.
- Ah.
But I think
I know someone who does.
What does he know?
I don't know.
I think- I think, perhaps,
where they are.
Can I see him?
I can try.
I can ask.
There's a telephone.
Shall I ask?
Where's the telephone?
In the back.
It's only a draft.
We'd better get you home.
I want to stay with you.
You are surprised to see me.
Yes, I am.
I told the police about Steiner.
I'm glad to see you again,
Mr. Cooper.
I'm glad to be of help.
I tried to help your friends, but-
- You know the house?
- Yes.
Where is it?
That's it.
- Is there anyone in there?
- I don't know.
I just know that's the house.
We must all go now.
Come on.
You can tell your people.
- Oh, no. I have to check whether she's right.
- How?
- I've gotta go over there to check whether she's right.
- I am right.
Alice can check, and your people.
Why do you have to do that?
Well, it's part of my job,
you see.
I'm going. I've shown you the house.
That's all I can do.
You go with them.
No. I'll wait for you.
You're stupid.
I go with you.
You keep the car.
Thank you.
Don't mention it.
Don't worry.
I'm just gonna check. That's all.
Listen, I want you to remember
a telephone number. All right?
- Yes.
- Now fix it.
218962.
Got it?
218962.
If I'm not back in 20 minutes,
ring that number.
Tell him you've run out of cigarettes.
Tell him where you are
and to bring you some. Okay?
- Yes.
- What's the number?
218962.
Stay here 20 minutes.
Listen.
I love you.
Come up, please.
Oh, hello, Quiller.
Do come in.
Sit down.
What a surprise.
And what will you have to drink?
A double Jack Daniel's
on the rocks.
No Jack Daniel's?
Tsk-tsk-tsk.
What would you say
to some old Kentucky Granddad?
- Make it scotch malt.
- Oh, I wish we could help you there.
But, unfortunately,
I know we can't.
What kind of a bar is this,
for Pete's sake?
I'm not a barman, Mr. Quiller.
I'm a German gentleman.
Please.
Where are we going?
Downstairs.
He's working late.
- We are moving tomorrow.
- Oh.
Yes. We have
a busy night ahead of us.
We are moving all our equipment.
- We are changing our base.
- Oh.
Herr Nagel.
Herr Dorffman.
Mr. Quiller.
And this is...
Fr√§ulein Lindt.
We just found her
sitting in a car quite near here.
Her first name is Inge.
- So what?
- She's your friend.
I've never seen her before.
Oh, yes, yes.
She's your close friend.
Inge.
I remember the name well.
You, do you remember the name?
Yes, Reichsf√ºhrer.
You can talk to me quite easily, can't you?
- No.
- Of course you can.
You need to relax.
They work you too hard.
That boss of yours,
what's his name?
Uh- Uh-
What's his name?
- Inge.
- No, she's a girl.
She's not your boss.
She has long legs.
Really? I'm so glad to hear that.
You're very lucky.
After you leave us, you can go to her.
She's waiting for you.
White.
- She adores you.
- No.
Oh, yes, adores you.
She wants you only.
She longs for you only.
Longs.
Adores me.
Wants me-
And here she is.
No. No, not at all.
The Inge I was talking
about was fat. Very fat. Gigantic.
I don't know this girl.
For a nice, innocent
German girl...
you pick very bizarre friends.
Do you understand English?
Nein.
You must find him very attractive.
What's it like to be
so sexually attractive, Quiller?
Hmm?
Anyway, I'm so glad
you were able to drop in tonight.
You're quite free to go now.
Really. You can go.
Now.
There's just one thing.
We are still very interested
in the location of your base.
We feel that there might be
some information there...
which could be
of importance to us.
So let me make
a proposal to you.
If you would like to
tell us where your base is...
you can take her with you.
Truly. She will be quite safe,
quite free.
If not, she will stay here...
with us.
Hmm?
But do go if you like.
Consider the matter.
Take a walk.
Think about it.
But please don't forget that you have complete
freedom to return here at any time.
Give us the information
we require and leave...
with this lady.
We'll give you till dawn.
If you're still
undecided by dawn...
we will kill you both.
How is that?
- Fair?
- Sure.
Good.
Right.
I'll get some air.
Yes, why don't you.
I hope to see you
a little later tonight.
In fact, I'm sure I will.
Take Mr. Quiller up in the lift.
He knows the way out.
- Guten nacht.
- Guten nacht.
Danke sch√∂n.
Do you have a light?
Nonsmoker, huh?
Yes. He's here.
Any coffee?
I think so.
Where is Pol?
He's been on all night.
He's just gone to bed. He is coming.
Sugar?
No, thanks.
We have been up all night too.
Have you?
Hello, Quiller.
Tiergarten, number six.
That's their base.
Big house by the canal.
Looks derelict.
Get Ziegler.
Will they still be there?
Yeah. They're not worried.
They think I'm dead.
They think I was blown up in a car.
Hello? Ziegler.
Our man's back.
Tiergarten, number six.
By the canal.
You can go in now. Right.
I'd like a full report
as soon as possible, Quiller.
You'll get it.
Give yourself
a little rest first, of course.
Oh, thanks.
I'm gonna change.
Any word?
No.
Hello? Take it.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Well, thank you.
Good-bye.
They've got them all.
Good.
- Well, where's my breakfast?
- Where's mine?
Oh, are you hungry?
Why don't we have breakfast together
upstairs in about, uh, oh, eight minutes.
I'm too tired
to go upstairs.
We'll have it sent to you, Quiller.
Don't put yourself out.
- Will you join me, Hengel?
- With pleasure.
Well, that's that.
For the time being.
What are the details?
Not many. They got them all.
They got Oktober.
Did they find a girl there?
No, no mention of a girl.
They got Dorffman and Nagel.
- Are you sure they didn't find a girl there?
- Yes, quite sure.
No. No girl.
Hello.
Hello. How are you?
I'm all right.
I was very lucky.
What? Sorry?
I said I was very lucky.
Oh? How?
They let me go.
Did they?
Yes.
Yes, suddenly they told me to go.
Well, you must have felt
pretty relieved.
I did.
We got all of them.
Oh, really? Good.
Well, not all of them, perhaps.
Most of them.
You seem tired.
I had a heavy night.
Oh, uh, I tried to phone that number,
by the way, after I got out.
You remember the number
you gave me?
Oh, yes.
Yes, that's right.
But it didn't exist.
Oh, really?
I must have made a mistake.
Well, I'm leaving Berlin.
Are you?
I'm a little tired.
You work too hard.
Well, you too. I'm sure you could
take things a little easier, you know.
Oh, no, I-
I have my work to do.
I must do it.
I want to do it.
Well, if I ever get back to Berlin,
I'll look you up.
Yes, please.
That would be nice.
By the way, did you ever
meet a man called Jones?
No.
No, I don't think so.
Good-bye.
Ja!
