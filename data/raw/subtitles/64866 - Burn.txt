[ Man ]
Don't leave us down here!
We'll drown like rats!
[ Man #2 ] Shut up
or I'll toss you overboard!
You stay chained!
We're never gonna
make it to Sparta.
We'll make it.
[ Chuckles ]
You murdered a man.
 You will stand trial for that.
You are a fool!
The seas are filled
with pirates.
If the storm doesn't
kill us, they will.
We'll see.
[ All Shouting, Indistinct ]
So much for pirates.
[ Thunderclap ]
[ Prisoner ]
Hercules!
Unchain me!
We're gonna capsize!
- Just hold on! Whoa!
- [ Men Yelling ]
If the boat sinks, I'm
gonna go down with it!
We'll all go down.
You won't.
You're not chained to it.
Cut me loose.
[ Thunderclap ]
[ Grunts ]
[ Prisoner ]
We're going down!
Every man for himself!

Thanks for saving me.
[ Man Narrating ]
This is the story
of a time long ago,
a time of myth and legend,
when the ancient gods
were petty and cruel,
and they plagued mankind
with suffering.
Only one man dared
to challenge their power--
Hercules.
Hercules possessed a strength
the world had never seen,
a strength surpassed
only by the power of his heart.
He journeyed the earth,
battling the minions
of his wicked stepmother, Hera,
the all-powerful
queen of the gods.
But wherever
there was evil,
wherever an innocent
would suffer,
there would be... Hercules.
- [ Screeching ]
- [ Roaring ]
Hail!
[ Grunts Softly ]
[ Groans ]
[ Panting ]
"Thanks for saving me."
[ Grunting ]
[ Panting ]
[ Sighs ]
[ Grunts ]
[ Groans ]
[ Wood Cracking ]
Don't worry.
It's just a tree stump.
But you're wise
to be careful.
- Now I figure we're even.
- How do you figure that?
You saved my life on the boat,
and I didn't kill you
on the beach.
- I suppose I should thank you.
- If I wanted you dead,
  you wouldn't be here.
Well, I'm here now.
Like I said: We're even.
But if you keep on comin'
after me, I will kill you.
[ Grunting ]
[ Gasping ]
I'm warning you:
Don't follow me.

[ Pirate ]
Think anyone made it
off the prison ship?
[ Pirate #2 ]
Spread out!
Look for survivors!
[ Pirate #3 ] Let's go.
Search the beach. Maybe
the gold washed ashore.
Tracks. Human tracks.
Someone was tryin'
to cover them.
[ Pirate ] Right over there.
Why bother? Unless
the gold was on the prison ship
like you said.
Over here! Tracks!
I see tracks!
Here! This way!
There are only two sets
of tracks.
The gold is either
at the bottom of the ocean,
or those two buried it.
What if they don't
want to tell us?
Then we will just have
to persuade them.

- Your camouflage
  needs a little work.
- Doesn't matter.
You're still a dead man.
[ Both Grunting ]
[ Groaning ]
[ Yelps ]
You're good, Hercules,
even with one arm.
But are you good enough?
[ Yelps, Grunts ]
Here. Let me help.
[ Yelping ]
[ Screaming ]
Oh, no!
That's a dried-up well
you're in. You'd better
start digging.
We'd find water
a lot quicker if you were
down here helpin' me.
True. Very true.
But I need my wrist.
[ Grunts ]
Big eggs.
Looks like
we're not alone.
[ Grunting ]
[ Flies Buzzing ]
- Have a nice nap?
-[ Blow Lands ]
[ Prisoner Panting ]
Look. The only way
we're gonna get off this island
is if we work together.
Oh, yeah. Now
you wanna work together.
Just keep digging.
I could dig a lot faster
if my arms were untied.
Yeah. I suppose you could.
What if I promise
not to escape?
I remember the last time
 I gave you a break.
Besides,
I like knowing
where you are. [ Grunts ]
Your arm swelling?
It's probably infected.
You could use my help
fixing it.
[ Gasping ]
I can handle it myself.
[ Sizzling ]
[ Grunting ]
Should we bury him?
Why waste the effort?
You two-- go on ahead.
Split up if you have to,
but find water.
- [ Grunts Affirmatively ]
- You-- back to the ship.
  Bring water.
- Yes, sir.
- I doubt if these two
  have found water either.
They must be getting weaker.
Let us hope
they do not die...
before they tell us
where they hid the gold.
[ Chuckling ]
I should've become a farmer
like my father.
And why didn't you?
I didn't have his touch
for the soil.
[ Chuckles ]
That's too bad.
You wouldn't be here now.
I guess
it's like every son.
You either wanna
be just like your father
or just the opposite.
[ Grunts ]
So you became a killer?
No. Not at first.
Soldiering was just the thing
to get me the furthest away
from that farm.
So you hated your father
that much?
No. I-- I loved him.
I just wanted
to go on my own.
Water. Water.
I found water! I hit water!
[ Gasps ]
- [ Groans, Spits ]
- [ Sighs ]
- Salt.
- Oh, sh--
I've been all over
the east side of this island,
and there's no safe water
to be found.
Then we'll have
to head west.
[ Low Rumbling ]
[ Chittering,
  Screeching ]
I know he didn't
get up there without legs.
No.
My guess is he left them
with whomever was chasing him.
We've been on this island
for two days. I haven't seen
anything big enough to do that.
Sometimes...
it's what you can't see
that can hurt you the most.
Remember those
strange-looking pods
we saw in the well?
Yeah. What about 'em?
I think
they were egg sacs.
Wow. They were huge.
I know.
[ Sighs ]
[ Prisoner ]
Well, oh great
monster killer,
what are our choices?
There's no water,
no choices.
We keep
heading west.
[ Growls ]
Sordis.
- No gold
  buried down here.
- [ Growls ]
[ Pirate ]
Pull 'im up.
They could not have
carried it this far.
If it survived the storm,
it's back where they landed.
Don't worry.
We'll get them to tell us.
That saltwater couldn't
have done them any good.
You think we're
gaining on 'em?
They're dragging their feet.
They have to be
on their last legs.
[ Growls ]
How's that arm?
You shut up
and keep moving.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Groans ]
[ Both Yelling ]
[ Yells Echo ]
-[ Creature Growling ]
- Get up!
You fool.
You should be
saving your strength.
[ Creature Growling ]
- [ Screaming ]
- [ Grunting ]
- [ Creature Chittering ]
- [ Men Yelling ]
Oh, what was that?
[ Grunts ]
I have no idea.
[ Screeching ]
- [ Hercules Grunting ]
- [ Creature Chittering ]
[ Growling ]
[ Panting ]
[ Rumbling ]
[ Both Gasp ]
Over here!
Where'd it go?
[ Whispering ]
Derk. The shell.
[ Creature Growling ]
No!
[ Creature Screeches ]
[ Creature Burps ]
I guess he doesn't
care much for shells.
Yeah. Or burrowing
through stone.
You're pretty good at that.
Must have had some practice.
When you're a soldier,
you learn.
Tell me something.
Why do you keep
savin' me?
The reward's the same
whether my head's
in a bag or not.
I told you before:
I'm not interested
in the money.
What then?
Justice?
[ Cackles ]
You can't really believe
that I'll get justice.
You should've thought of that
before you killed Lycus.
I doubt Lycus gave it a thought
when he killed the sons
of the woman that hired me.
I've known Lycus
a long time.
I've never known him
to kill anyone.
When was the last time
you saw Lycus?
There's a family in Attica
without any male heirs
because of him.
All I know is that the courts
decide guilt and punishment,
not mercenaries.
Well, the courts
didn't punish Lycus,
so I did.
And how do I know you've
been telling the truth?
'Cause I'm not a liar.
No. You just kill people.
Derk-- Derk,
this isn't the time
for this.
Why?
I'll give you three reasons.
[ Low Rumbling ]
[ Derk ]
We're going to be here
until we rot.
- Have you always
  been so optimistic?
- No. I'm just-- I'm tired.
I'm tired of being chased.
I'm tired of running.
I'm... just tired.
If you don't bring me back,
they'll just send somebody
who will.
You should've
considered that before
becoming a killer for hire.
Well, the army
doesn't train you
for peacetime work.
[ Chuckles Softly ]
Look. If we get out of this,
I wanna make a deal.
It's no deals.
Before you take me back,
I wanna see my family again.
Seems strange
for a family man to be
in your kind of business.
It put food on the table,
all right?
You give me your word
that I can see my family
once more,
I promise I won't try
to run away anymore.
My word is good.
Deal.
- But I want something
  from you first.
- All right. Name it.
You're right about my arm.
It's getting worse,
and I--
I need some help.
Well, I've...
set a few limbs,
and I've
cut a few limbs off...
when necessary.
This is for you.
To bite on.
[ Groans ]
You ready?
Ooh!
[ Bone Snaps ]
[ Agonized Yell ]
I didn't do anything
other than kill somebody
who had killed someone else.
Revenge never evens out.
It just perpetuates itself.
[ Rock Lands ]
[ Creature Roars ]
[ Rock Whistles Overhead ]
You ever think
about the families
of the men you kill?
No. What's the point? It'd
only make the work harder.
[ Rock Lands ]
[ Creature Snorts ]
Maybe you should start.
[ Creature Growls ]
[ Rock Whistles Overhead ]
I can smell them.
Come on!
[ Pirate Growls ]
[ Creature Growling ]
Throw another one.
What?
Throw another rock.
[ Rock Whistles Overhead ]
Maybe they've gone.
 Maybe--
Shh.
-[ Pirates Screaming ]
-[ Hercules ]
 Listen.
[ Screaming Continues ]
[ Creature Growling ]
They found somebody else.
Come on.
Shouldn't we be
going that way?
No. They may need our help.
Wait. [ Grunts ]
Maybe they have water.
-[ Screaming Continues ]
- [ Creatures Growling ]
[ Man Shrieking ]

- [ Chittering ]
[ Creature Screeching ]
Hey.
You have enough energy
to do a flip?
Yeah. If my life
depended on it.
It does.
- Get down the middle here.
- What?
Just get down.
I'll tell you
when to jump.
[ Growling ]
- Now!
- [ Grunts ]
- [ Grunts ]
  Thanks.
-[ Creature Squealing ]
There are still two left.
You got any ideas?
Just one.
It doesn't
require leaping,
does it?
[ Chuckles ]
[ Groans ]
Ohh.
Remember: Run fast.
Go!
[ Creature Growling ]
Now!
- [ Creature Squealing ]
- [ Creature Chittering ]
[ Creatures Growling ]
[ Sighs ]
Let's get outta here.
Yeah. Water's west.
Those men didn't drop
out of the sky.
Their ship and their water
is east.
Let's go.
[ Both Chuckle ]
-Let 'em roll!
 You owe me ten dinars!
- [ Both Chuckle ]
Hey. I need your boat.
[ Yells ]
[ Grunts ]
[ Bones Crack ]
[ Grunts ]
I'm surprised
you didn't kill 'im.
Well, I guess you're
rubbing off on me.
Let's go see your family.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
[ Knocking ]
[ Woman ]
Who's there?
Daddy!
It's not our daddy.
[ Girl ]
Then who are you?
I'm Hercules.
[ Kids Giggling ]
You don't mind
putting them to bed?
Ohh, not at all.
Thank you.
Where are you going,
Mom?
Oh, I won't be long.
You just listen
to Hercules.
My dad used
to tell us stories before
we went to bed. Can you?
I, uh-- I'm a little
out of practice, but I'll see
what I can do.
[ Derk Chuckles ]
Derk!
I was so afraid
I'd never see you again.
Then you're going back
with him?
I have to.
 I gave my word.
Maybe Marcus can do something.
He's the new magistrate
in Sparta.
He was more concerned
with his career
than my life.
But that's so unfair.
I know.
There's a lot of things
I've done that I haven't
told you about...
that I'm ashamed of.
I'm s--
I'll wake the children
so you can say good-bye.
No.
- Promise me you won't
  tell 'em I'm here.
- But why?
If they love me
like I love them,
they might end up like me,
and I want a better life
for them than that.
- But, Derk, you can't just--
- Promise me.
If they need someone
to look up to,
let it be my father.
- Or Hercules.
- I promise.
But you should see them.
We just won't wake them.
We'd better go.
[ Bell Tolling ]
[ Chattering ]
Execute him. Next.
No. Please.
Have mercy!
I was only trying
to feed my family!
Derkus Petronicus.
- His crime?
-[ Aide ] Assassination
 of a public official.
- [ Gavel Bangs ]
- Execute him. Next.
Hold on here.
Doesn't he get a trial?
He was tried--
in absentia--
and found guilty.
I meant a fair trial.
What about counsel?
This is Spartan law.
You do believe
in the law, don't you?
I believe in justice.
Hmm.
Justice.
[ Snickers ]
Wait a minute!
Save your breath.
The Spartans
have their own kind
of justice.
But it's not right.
Neither is what I did.
[ Chattering ]
Get on with it!
[ Soldiers Gasping ]
[ Soldier ]
Look! Above!
[ Soldier ]
Guards! Guards! Stop him!
He's getting away!
-After him, you fools!
- [ Soldier Grunting ]
[ Soldier ]
Come on! There he is!
[ Soldier #2 ]
Over there!
[ Indistinct Shouting ]
[ Gasping, Grunting ]
[ Panting ]
[ Groans ]
Don't you ever give up?
I suppose you've come
to take me back again.
That was my arrow.
Why?
What was happening to you--
It wasn't justice.
Thank you.
It's not that easy.
You go back to your family.
You be a farmer,
a fisherman,
but you put your mercenary days
behind you.
It's done.
Give you my word.
Good.
[ Distant Shouting ]
You'd better get going.
It won't be long before
they pick up your trail.
Hercules,
you're always welcome
in my home.
[ Shouting Continues ]
