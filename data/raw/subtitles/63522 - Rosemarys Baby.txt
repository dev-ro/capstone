- Are you a doctor?
- Yes.
He's an actor.
We're very popular with actors.
Have I seen you in anything?
I did Hamlet a while back, didn't I?
And then we did The Sandpiper.
He was in Luther
and Nobody Loves An Albatross
and a lot of TV commercials.
- That's where the money is.
- And the artistic thrills, too.
Seven, Diego.
The apartments have been broken
into fours, fives and six es.
Seven-E is a four,
originally the back part of a 10.
The original dining room
is its living room,
and two servants' rooms together
are a dining room or second bedroom.
Do you have children?
We plan to.
We must oil that gate, Diego.
This way, please.
The previous tenant,
Mrs Gardenia, died a few days ago,
so nothing has been moved yet.
The furniture could be had
practically for asking.
Did she die in the apartment?
Oh, no, no, no. In a hospital.
She' d been in a coma for weeks.
- After you, please.
- Thank you.
She was very old
and passed away without waking.
I' d be grateful to go that way
myself when the time comes.
Oh, no, no, no.
Not in the apartment, no.
She was chipper right to the end.
One of the first women
lawyers in New York.
- Did a little gardening, too.
- She was quite a woman.
Oh, closet. Plenty of closets.
A nice view of the park.
- Very nice view.
- Yeah.
This room would make
a lovely nursery.
Yes. Yellow and white wallpaper
would brighten it.
- What are all these things?
- Herbs, mostly.
Nice large bathroom.
- Mint, basil.
- Yeah. No marijuana?
The master bedroom.
- Oh, yes.
- Back at the hallway again.
There.
- Oh... Oh, Guy!
- Yeah.
- Ohh!
- The fireplace works, of course.
- Great.
- Oh!
It's a wonderful apartment.
I love it!
She's trying to get you
to lower the rent.
We' d raise it if we were allowed.
Apartments with this kind of charm...
Why, that's odd.
There's a closet
behind that secretary.
I'm sure there is.
Yeah. Oh, I think you're right.
She moved it. It used to be there.
Give me a hand, will you?
I see now why she went into a coma.
She couldn't have lifted it
by herself. She was 89.
Should we open it?
Maybe her son should.
I'm authorised to show the apartment.
- Well!
- Whatever she locked in got out.
Perhaps she
didn't need five closets.
Why cover up her
vacuum cleaner and her towels?
I don't suppose we'll ever know.
Maybe she was becoming senile.
Anything else?
What about laundry facilities?
It's bigger than the other one.
Yeah.
It's more expensive, too, you know?
It's better located.
Yeah, I could walk to all
the theatres from here.
Oh, Guy, let's take it, please?
That living room could be...
Oh, please!
OK. We get out
of the other lease, OK.
I was tempted to write
that you were drug addicts.
Instead, I decided to lie
and say you were wonderful.
- You're great, Hutch.
- Could I talk you out of it?
- He's pulling your leg.
- Indeed I'm not.
That looks great.
You know the Bramford
had rather an unpleasant reputation?
It's where the Trench sisters
conducted their dietary experiments
and Keith Kennedy held his parties.
Adrian Marcato lived there, too...
- Trench sisters?
- Adrian Marcato?
The Trench sisters were two Victorian
ladies. They ate young children.
- Lovely.
- Marcato practised witchcraft.
He made quite a splash by announcing
he' d conjured up the living devil.
People attacked and nearly killed him
in the lobby of the Bramford.
You're joking?
Later, after the Keith Kennedy
business, the house was half empty.
I didn't know
that Marcato lived there.
World War II
filled the house up again.
Terrific.
- The house?
- The lamb.
It's called Black Bramford.
Awful things happen
in every apartment house.
This house has
a lot of unpleasant happenings.
In '59, a dead infant was found,
wrapped in newspaper in the basement.
You really rouse my appetite.
Have some more wine.
Roman!
Bring me in some root beer
when you come!
Hey, these are shelves.
Hey... let's make love.
I think I hear the
Trench sisters chewing.
Straight up to the left.
Here in Daytona, Florida,
it's the 250cc 100-mile classic
with Yamaha leading and winning it,
taking seven of the top 10 places.
It's the third straight year
for Yamaha, a clean sweep.
Yamaha is race-bred from champions,
with a model for all kinds of riding.
You should discover the swingin'
world of Yamaha. Have a ride.
- Come on. Get on.
- OK, come on. Let's go.
Look.
It's great.
I'm sorry. I thought you were
Victoria Vetri, the actress.
I'm sorry.
That's OK.
A lot of people think I'm Victoria.
- I don't see any resemblance.
- Do you know her?
No.
- My name's Terry Gionoffrio.
- Hi, I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.
- We're new tenants.
- I'm staying with the Castevets.
I'm their guest, sort of.
Our apartment was the back of yours.
You took the old lady's apartment.
Mrs...?
- Yeah... Gardenia.
- Gardenia. Yeah.
She used to grow all kinds of herbs
for her to cook with.
- I saw them.
- Now she grows her own.
Ex cuse me, I have to add softener.
- What does your husband do?
- He's an actor.
- What's his name?
- Guy Woodhouse.
He was in Luther and Nobody Loves An
Albatross, and he does a lot of TV.
Gee, I watch TV all day long.
I bet I've seen him.
- I hate this basement.
- Yeah, me, too.
It gives me the creeps.
Let's come down
together and do our laundry.
That' d be great.
I have a good luck charm.
It might work for both of us.
- That's beautiful.
- Isn't it?
Mrs Castevet gave it to me.
It's supposed to be good luck.
It's got some stuff inside.
I'm not mad about the smell either.
I hope it works.
It's beautiful.
I've never seen anything like it.
European. The Castevets are the most
wonderful people in the world.
- They picked me up off the sidewalk.
- You were sick?
I was starving, on dope
and a lot of other things.
I'm like the daughter they never had.
At first,
I thought they wanted me for sex,
but they're like real grandparents.
I'm glad there are people like that.
You hear so much about apathy, people
who are afraid of getting involved.
I' d be dead now without them.
That's a fact. Dead or in jail.
You don't have any family
that could help?
A brother in the navy.
It's impossible to be 100%sure!
If you want my opinion, we shouldn't
tell her! That's my opinion!
That must be the partition.
That's the back part of the original
10 with a dining room,
and there's...a closet here,
and then there's a closet over here.
Stay back, huh, lady?
Get back, please.
There's nothing to see.
Get back, will you, please?
- Jesus.
- Get back!
- We know her.
- What's her name?
- Terry.
- Terry what?
Ro? What was her name again?
Terry what?
I don't remember.
An ltalian name.
She was staying with
some people named Castevet.
Yeah. We got that already.
Short and sweet. She stuck it
to the window with a Band-Aid.
- Come on. Get back.
- Theresa Gionoffrio.
Move on! Move on!
- You knew her?
- Only slightly.
- Come on, Ro, baby. Let's go.
- Oh! Here they come.
You folks the Castevets?
We are.
You have a Theresa Gionoffrio
living with you?
We do. Has there been an accident?
Brace yourself for some bad news.
She's dead. Jumped out of the window.
That's not possible! It's a mistake!
Artie, you want to let these folks
take a look, please?
I knew this would happen.
She got deeply depressed
every three weeks or so.
I told my wife about it,
but she pooh-poohed me.
That doesn't mean she killed herself.
She was a happy girl,
no reason for self-destruction.
- Must've been cleaning the windows.
- At midnight?
- Why not? Maybe she was!
- Is that her handwriting?
- Yeah.
- Definitely. Absolutely.
I'll see this gets back to you
when we're done.
I don't believe it. I just
don't believe it. She was so happy.
- Who 's the next-of-kin?
- She didn't have anybody, only us.
- She had a brother.
- Did she?
- In the navy.
- News to me.
- Where is he stationed?
- I don't know.
She mentioned him to me in the
laundry room. I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.
Uh, we're in seven-E.
I feel just the way you do,
Mrs Castevet.
She seemed so happy and full of...
She said wonderful things about you,
how grateful she was.
Thank you.
Know anything else
about this brother?
- No, I don't.
- It should be easy to find him.
- I'm so stunned. I'm so sorry.
- It's such a pity.
Well, thank you.
Sometimes I wonder how come
you're the leader of anything.
Don't tell me what Laura-Louise said.
If you' d listened
we wouldn't have had to do this!
We' d have been set to go now instead
of having to start from scratch!
I told you
not to tell her in advance!
I told you
she wouldn't be open-minded!
I told Sister Veronica
about the windows,
and she withdrew the school
from the competition.
- Hello. How are you?
- Fine. May I come in?
Of course. Please do.
I came to thank you
for saying those nice things.
Poor Terry. We thought we' d failed
her, though her note said we hadn't.
You'll never know how helpful
it was in such a shock moment.
So I do thank you. Roman does, too.
Roman's my hubby.
I'm glad I could help.
Well, she was cremated yesterday.
We got to forget and go on.
It won't be easy.
We don't have any children. You?
- No.
- Well, there you have it.
That's nice!
Look how you put the table!
Now, isn't that interesting?
- I saw it in a magazine.
- Oh, my. Nice paint job.
I know.
That's nice. What is that?
The TV room?
Only temporarily.
It's going to be a nursery.
- You're pregnant?
- Not yet.
I hope to be
as soon as we're settled.
You're young,
you ought to have lots.
- We plan to have three.
- I'm dying to see the apartment.
- The woman before was a friend.
- Terry said.
Did she? You had some long talks
in the laundry room.
- Only one.
- Oh! Oh, my goodness!
It looks so much brighter.
What do you pay for a chair
like that?
Uh, oh... Um, I'm not sure, really.
I think about $200.
- What does your hubby do?
- He's an actor.
I knew it! I said it to Roman
yesterday. He's so good-looking.
- What movies was he in?
- No movies.
Two plays called Luther and Nobody
Loves An Albatross, and a lot of TV.
Rosemary, I got a two-inch thick
sirloin steak defrosting now.
Why don't you and Guy
have supper with us?
- What do you say?
- Oh, we couldn't.
- Why not?
- No, really, that's very kind...
It would be a real help to us.
First night we'll be alone since...
Are you sure it wouldn't
be too much trouble?
Honey, if it was trouble,
I wouldn't ask.
All right, count on us.
I'll check with Guy.
You tell him
I won't take no for an answer!
- Here's your mail! Oh, ads.
- Thank you.
Donald Baumgart got that part.
It's a bad play.
Even if it folds out of town it's
the kind of part that gets noticed.
Mrs Castevet was here,
to thank me for what
I said about Terry.
She is the nosiest
person I've ever seen.
You know,
she asked the prices of things?
- No kidding.
- She invited us for dinner tonight.
I told her I' d have to check with
you, but it would probably be OK.
Jesus!
We don't have to, do we, honey?
I think they're lonely.
We get friendly with them
and we'll never get rid of them.
I told her she could count on us.
- You don't have to sulk about it.
- I'm not sulking.
I see exactly what you mean.
- Hell, we'll go.
- No, no. What for?
- We'll go!
- No. Not if you don't want to.
That sounds so phoney,
but I really mean it, really, I do.
Be my good deed for the day.
OK, but only if you want to.
And we'll make it clear that it's
just for this one night, all right?
Perfect timing! Come in.
Roman's fixing some vodka blushes.
I'm glad you could come, Guy.
I'm fixing to tell everybody
that I knew you when.
Dinner isn't ready just yet
but sit down there.
You'll be very comfortable.
I seem to have
overfilled the glasses.
No, no, no. Don't get up.
Generally, I pour these precise,
don't l, Minnie?
- Watch the carpet.
- But I've made too much,
and rather... Oh, there we are.
No, no. Sit down.
- Mrs Woodhouse...
- Thank you.
- Mr Woodhouse, vodka blush?
- Yes, thanks.
- Have you ever tasted one?
- No, I haven't.
- It looks delicious.
- They're popular in Australia.
- Now, welcome to our home!
- Hear, hear.
Cheers.
- The carpet!
- Oh, dear.
Brand-new carpet.
This man is so clumsy!
Do you come from Australia?
Oh, no, I'm from
right here in New York.
I've been there, though.
I've been everywhere.
You name a place and I've been there.
Go ahead, name a place.
Fairbanks, Alaska!
I've been there, all over Alaska...
Fairbanks, Juneau, Anchorage,
Nome, Sitka, Seward.
- Went there in '38...
- Where are you from?
Well...
I'm from Omaha. Guy's from Baltimore.
They're good cities.
Do you travel for business?
Both. I'm 79, and I've been going
one place or another since I was 10.
I've been everywhere.
Steak's ready.
Don't rush your drinks.
Roman, take your pill!
No pope visits a city
where the newspapers are on strike.
I heard he's going to wait
till it's over.
That's showbiz.
That's exactly what it is. All the
costumes, rituals - all religions.
- We're offending Rosemary.
- No, no.
- Are you religious, my dear?
- I was brought up a Catholic.
- You looked uncomfortable.
- He is the Pope.
You don't have to respect him
because he pretends he's holy.
That's a good point.
What they spend on robes and jewels!
A good picture of the hypocrisy
behind organised religion
was given in Luther. Did you ever
get to play that leading part, Guy?
Weren't you
Albert Finney's understudy?
- No.
- Well, that's strange.
I remember being struck
by a gesture you made
and checking to see who you were.
- Um, what gesture was that?
- I'm not sure, it was a reaction...
Oh, I did a thing with my arms
when Luther was having a fit.
- It was a kind of involuntary reach.
- That's it!
- It had a wonderful authenticity.
- Oh, come on.
No, I mean it.
My father was a theatrical producer.
My early years
were spent in the company
of Mrs Fiske,
Forbes-Robertson, Modjeska.
- Guy?
- Oh, yes, please.
You have an interesting inner
quality. It's in your TV work, too.
It should take you a long way,
provided that you get
those initial breaks.
Are you preparing for a show now?
Um, I'm up for a couple of parts.
- I can't believe you won't get them.
- I can.
I' d like to have
a spice garden some day.
I guess I'm a country girl at heart.
- You come from a big family?
- Three brothers and two sisters.
Your sisters married?
- They have children?
- One has two, the other has four.
- You'll have lots of children, too.
- We're fertile.
- I've got 16 nieces and nephews.
- Oh, my goodness!
Would you like me to wash
and you can wipe for a while?
Oh, no. That's fine, dear.
Roman, stop bending
Guy's ears with your stories.
He's only listening to be polite.
No, it's very interesting,
Mrs Castevet.
Minnie! I'm Minnie, he's Roman, OK?
OK! Terrific. Just terrific.
Goodbye, darling. Goodbye.
It was lovely, bless you.
- Minnie!
- Minnie, ya great kid, ya.
How about that steak?!
And the cake!
How did you eat two pieces?
Out of politeness.
That's how, out of politeness.
Only three dinner plates
that matched.
- And all that beautiful silver.
- Maybe they'll will it to us.
- Guess what's in their bathroom?
- A bidet.
- " Jokes For The John."
- No.
A book on a hook
right next to the toilet.
Roman's stories are pretty
damned interesting, though.
I'm going to go over there again
tomorrow night and hear some more.
- You are?
- Yeah. He asked me. Do this for me.
I thought we were seeing
Joan and Dick Jellico.
- Was that definite?
- Not definite.
We'll see them next week.
You don't have to come along
if you don't want to.
- You can stay here.
- Yeah, I think I will stay here.
He knew Henry Irving, too. I mean,
really interesting, you know?
Why did they take
their pictures down?
What do you mean?
Their pictures. They took them down.
Hooks in the wall and clean spaces.
- The one picture there doesn't fit.
- I didn't notice.
Hi, dear. This is my dear friend
Laura-Louise McBurney,
lives up on 12.
This is Guy's wife, Rosemary.
Hello, Rosemary!
Laura-Louise just met Guy.
Could we come in?
- Uh, of course. Please do.
- There you are. Go ahead.
Look what they got. There's a light.
Oh, gosh!
- Isn't that beautiful!
- It came this morning.
- Are you all right, dear?
- Oh, I'm fine.
It's the first day of my period.
And you're up and around? On my
first day, I couldn't do anything!
Dan gave me gin through
a straw to kill the pain.
Girls today take things
more in their stride.
They're healthier than us,
thanks to vitamins.
- What are those things, seat covers?
- Cushions for the window seats.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, before I forget,
- this is for you from Roman and me.
- For me?
It's just a little present is all.
For moving in.
- There's no reason...
- It's real old, over 300 years.
It's lovely.
The green inside is tannis root.
That's for good luck.
It's lovely, but I...
I can't accept it.
You already have. Put it on.
You'll get used to the smell
before you know it.
Yeah, go on.
Oh, yes.
Were his stories
as interesting as last night?
Yes. Did you have a good time?
All right. I got a present.
- It was Terry's.
- No kidding? Kind of pretty, though.
Aren't you going to wear it?
It smells. There's stuff in it called
tannis root from her greenhouse.
Not too bad, though.
Tannis, anyone?
Well, if you took it
you ought to wear it.
Hello? Yes, this is he.
Oh, God, no.
Oh, the poor guy.
And they don't have
any idea what's causing it?
Oh, my God, that's awful.
That's just awful.
Yes, I would. I mean, yes, I am.
I hate to get it that way, but...
Well, you' d have to speak to my agent
about that end of it.
Alan Stone.
I'm sure there won't be any problem,
not as far as we're concerned.
Thank you, Mr Weiss.
Guy?
What is it?
Donald Baumgart... he's gone blind.
He woke up yesterday
and he can't see.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, I've got the part.
It's a hell of a way to get it.
Listen, uh...
I have to get out and walk around.
Yeah, I understand. Go ahead.
Baumgart. Donald Baumgart.
It's a fascinating part.
He'll be noticed.
He also has an offer for a lead
in a TV series, Miami Beach.
He's suddenly very hot.
Mm, now I understand
why you're so overjoyed.
Well, it's a difficult
period in his life. A challenge.
I see.
You know how actors are,
they're all a bit self-centred.
I'll bet even Laurence Olivier
is vain and self-centred.
It's a difficult part.
He's got to work with crutches,
and naturally he's preoccupied.
And he...
Well...preoccupied.
I see you had another suicide
up there at Happy House.
- Didn't I tell you?
- No.
It was the girl who was rehabilitated
by this old couple, the Castevets.
I'm sure I told you that.
They didn't rehabilitate her
very successfully.
I've been a creep.
It's from worrying
if Baumgart would regain his sight.
Oh, you're bound to feel
two ways about it.
I'm going to stop giving you
the short end of the stick.
- You haven't been.
- Yes, I have.
I've been tearing my
hair out over my career.
Let's have a baby. All right?
Let's have three babies,
one at a time.
A baby. You know,
Mama, Dada, poo-poo. You know?
- You mean it?
- Sure, I mean it.
I even figured out
the right time to start, look.
- You mean it, really?
- No, I'm kidding. Sure, I mean it.
Oh, Ro, honey, for God's sake,
don't cry.
Oh, no. I won't.
Here goes nothing.
- The paint! The paint!
- Good grief.
Nobody, but nobody
has a fire tonight.
Isn't it gorgeous? I hope
we have the coldest winter ever.
Oh, shit!
Hi, Guy! How are ya?
No, don't let her in. Not tonight.
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Are you sure you won't come in?
No! I don't want to bother you.
Good. Good.
Who says there's nothing to ESP?
We shall have dessert after all!
Mousse au chocolat. Or as Minnie
calls it...chocolate mouse.
I was afraid she' d stay all evening.
She just wanted us to try it.
Her speciality.
It was sweet of her, really.
We shouldn't make fun of her.
Yeah, you're right, you're right.
It's good.
It has an undertaste.
A chalky undertaste.
I don't get it.
That's silly, there is no undertaste.
There is.
Come on. The old bat slaved all day.
Now eat it.
- I don't like it.
- It's delicious.
- Here, you have mine.
- There's always something wrong.
If it's going to turn
into a big thing...
If you can't stand it, don't eat it.
It's delicious!
No undertaste at all.
Would you turn
the record over, please?
There, Daddy, do I get a gold star?
You get two of them.
I'm sorry if I was stuffy.
You were.
It's the Pope at Yankee Stadium!
Christ, what a mob!
Everywhere the Pope has been
he's received this type of reception.
As one man put it this afternoon,
"Perhaps we are being undignified,
but this is a special day."
That's a great spot
for my Yamaha commercial.
Here's a brief summary
of today's historic happenings.
Pope Paul VI arrived at 9.27am...
What is it?
Dizzy...
No wonder. All that booze.
You didn't eat anything
all day before dinner, huh?
Nice.
Sleep is what you need.
A good night's sleep.
We have to make a baby.
Oh, we'll...we'll do it.
- Tomorrow. There's plenty of time.
- Just a nap.
Why are you taking them off?
To make you more comfortable.
- I am more comfortable.
- Sleep, Ro.
Isn't Hutch coming with us?
Catholics only, I...wish
we weren't bound by these prejudices,
but, unfortunately...
Easy, easy. You've got her too high.
Typhoon! Typhoon!
It killed 55 people in London...!
You better go down below, miss.
- She's awake. She sees.
- She don't see.
As long as she ate the mouse,
she can't see nor hear. Now sing.
I'm sorry to hear
you aren't feeling well.
It's only the mouse bite.
You' d better have your legs tied down
in case of convulsions.
Yes, I suppose so.
If it was rabid.
If the music bothers you
let me know and I'll stop it.
Oh, no, no, no. Please don't
change the program on my account.
Try to sleep.
We'll be waiting up on deck.
This is no dream!
This is really happening!
They tell me you have
been bitten by a mouse.
Yes. That's why
I couldn't come to see you.
That's all right. We wouldn't
want you to jeopardise your health.
Am I forgiven, Father?
Oh, absolutely.
Hey, it's after nine.
- Five minutes.
- I have to be at Alan's at 10.
- Eat out.
- Like hell I will.
- What time is it?
- It's ten after nine.
What time did I go to sleep?
You didn't go to sleep.
You passed out.
From now on you get cocktails
or wine, not cocktails and wine, hm?
The dreams I had.
Don't yell.
I already filed them down.
I didn't want to miss baby night.
- A couple of nails were ragged.
- While I was out?
It was fun,
in a necrophile sort of way.
I dreamed someone was...raping me.
- I don't know, someone inhuman.
- Thanks a lot!
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
I didn't want to miss the night.
We could've done it this morning.
Last night wasn't the only time.
I was a little bit
loaded myself, you know?
- Hello! Did ya like it?
- Oh, yes.
I put too much cream de cocoa in it.
No, no.
You'll have to give me the recipe.
Yeah. You going shopping?
Do me a teeny favour, will ya?
Get me six eggs,
a small instant Sanka.
- Right. Bye-bye.
- Yeah. Ahh.
We should talk about it.
- What?
- The way you haven't looked at me.
- What? I've been looking at you.
- You haven't.
Why, sure, I have.
Now, what is it? What's the matter?
Nothing. Never mind.
- No, no. Don't say that. What is it?
- Nothing.
Look, honey, I...I know I've been
preoccupied with the part,
but it is important.
That doesn't mean I don't love you.
It was due on Friday.
- It was?
- Mm-hm.
It'll probably come
tonight or tomorrow.
- Wanna bet?
- Yeah.
- A quarter. You're gonna lose.
- Shut up, will you?
You're getting me jumpy.
It's only been two days.
When will I know?
I'll call you when I get the results.
I like to do a general examination
just to know something more...
Elise Dunstan
recommended you, Doctor.
How is she?
- Fine. Did you deliver the boys?
- No, just the last.
- Universal haemoglobin.
- Yes, Doctor.
- We went to see The Fantasticks.
- Did you?
Did you enjoy it?
- Yeah.
- Good.
- Hello?
- Mrs Woodhouse?
- Dr Hill?
- Congratulations.
- Really?
- Really.
- Are you there?
- Yes, what happens now?
You come see me next month.
Get those pills. One a day.
- I'll mail you hospital forms.
- Uh, when will it be?
- It works out to be June 28th.
- That sounds so far away.
It is. One more thing,
we' d like another blood sample.
Oh, yes, of course. What for?
The nurse didn't take enough,
so would you drop by and see her?
But I am pregnant, aren't I?
Oh, yes, it's just
for blood samp... er, blood sugar.
- But you're pregnant.
- I'll come in on Monday.
- Don't forget the pills.
- No, I won't. Goodbye, Dr Hill.
Blood sugar?
What's that?
Oh! That's great! That's just great.
- Father.
- Mother.
Guy, Guy, listen.
Let's, uh, make this
a new beginning, OK?
A new openness with each other,
because we haven't been open.
That's true. I've been
so self-centred. That's the trouble.
You know I love you, don't you, Ro?
I swear to God,
I'll be as open and...
- It's my fault too.
- Bull, it's mine.
Bear with me.
I'll do better, you hear?
Oh, Guy.
- What?
- It's...
a fine way for parents
to be carrying on.
Hey...
- Know what I' d love to do?
- What?
Tell Minnie and Roman.
Oh, I know, I know. It's...
It's supposed to be
a deep, dark secret,
but I already told them
we were trying.
- They were so pleased.
- Tell them.
Back in two minutes?
You're pregnant.
Another blood sample.
Now, that's what I call good news.
- Oh, honey, congratulations.
- Thank you.
- Best wishes, Rosemary.
- Thank you.
We're more pleased than we can say.
We didn't have any champagne
but this will do.
- When are you due?
- June 28th.
It'll be so ex citing.
You got a good doctor?
Oh, yes, very good.
One of the top obstetricians is a
dear friend of ours, Abe Sapirstein.
One of the finest obstetricians
in the country.
- Wasn't he on Open End?
- That's right.
- Ro?
- Well, what about Dr Hill?
Don't worry, I'll tell him something.
You know me.
I won't let you go to
no Dr Hill nobody ever heard of.
The best is what you'll have!
Where's your telephone?
- The bedroom.
- He's a brilliant man.
- Very sensitive.
- Ro, sit down, sit down.
- No, I'm fine.
- Abe? Minnie.
Listen, a dear friend of ours
just found out she's pregnant.
Yeah, I'm in her apartment right now.
We said you' d take care of her,
you wouldn't charge
your society prices neither.
Just a minute.
Rosemary, tomorrow morning at 11?
- All right.
- Yeah, 11's fine, Abe.
Uh-huh. Yeah, well, you, too.
No, no, no, no, not at all.
All right. Well, let's hope so.
Goodbye.
- Well, there you are.
- Thanks a million, Minnie.
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Just have a fine, healthy baby.
My,
I can't wait to tell Laura-Louise.
Oh. Uh, please don't
tell anyone else, not right away.
No, she's right.
There's plenty of time.
- Now, to a fine, healthy baby.
- Hear, hear!
Andy. Or Susan.
Susan.
Please don't read books.
No pregnancy was ever
exactly like the ones in books.
And don't listen
to your friends, either.
No two pregnancies are ever alike.
- Dr Hill prescribed vitamin pills.
- No pills.
Minnie Castevet has a herbarium.
I'll have her make a daily drink
that'll be fresher, safer
and more vitamin-rich than any pills.
Any questions,
call me, night or day.
Call me, not your Aunt Fanny.
That's what I'm here for.
- Here.
- What's in it?
Snips and snails
and puppy dogs' tails.
- But what if we want a girl?
- Do you?
It would be nice
if the first one were a boy.
Well, there you are.
No, really, what is in it?
- A raw egg, gelatin, herbs.
- Tannis root?
Some of that
along with some other things.
If you want to be stupid
be non-violent stupid,
I'm in love with no one,
especially not your fat wife.
I'm a hopeless cripple...
What's that?
I've been to Vidal Sassoon.
Don't tell me you paid for that?
Guy, I have a pain.
- Where?
- Here.
- Just now?
- Since Monday.
- A sharp pain.
- Did you see Sapirstein?
I'm seeing him Wednesday.
This is ridiculous.
Go see Sapirstein.
- Why didn't you say?
- I see him Wednesday regular.
A natural expansion of the pelvis.
Take some ordinary aspirin.
I was afraid it might be
an ectopic pregnancy.
I thought you weren't
going to read books?
- It was in the drugstore.
- It just worried you.
Throw it away, please?
The pains will be gone in two days.
Ectopic pregnancy!
I look awful.
What are you talking about?
You look great.
It's that haircut that looks awful.
You want the truth, honey, that's
the worst mistake you ever made.
- My God!
- It's Vidal Sassoon. It's very in.
- What's wrong with you?
- Do I look that bad?
Terrible! You're not on
one of those Zen diets?
- No.
- Then what is it?
Have you seen a doctor?
I might as well tell you.
I'm pregnant.
Rubbish. Pregnant women gain weight.
They don't lose it.
I don't sleep well. I have stiff
joints or something, so I get a pain.
- Nothing serious.
- Well, congratulations.
- You must be very happy.
- Oh, I am. We both are.
- Who 's your obstetrician?
- Abraham Sapirstein.
Oh! He delivered
two of my daughter's babies.
- He's one of the best.
- When did you see him last?
- Um, yesterday.
- And?
And he says it's fairly common.
- How much weight have you lost?
- Three pounds.
You've lost far more than that.
It's perfectly normal
to lose a little at first.
Later on, I'll be gaining.
Well...we must assume Dr Sapirstein
knows whereof he speaks.
He should. He charges enough.
We get bargain rates.
Our neighbours are his friends.
I'll go.
Stay where you are.
It hurts less when I move around.
- I was just talking about you.
- Favourably, I hope.
- Do you need anything?
- No. Thank you for asking.
- Is Guy home already?
- He won't be home till six.
A friend of ours is here.
Would you...would you
like to meet him?
- If I won't be intruding?
- No. Please come in.
Hutch, this is Roman Castevet.
Edward Hutchins.
- How do you do?
- Oh, how are you, sir?
I was just saying,
you sent me to Dr Sapirstein.
- Rosemary told you the news?
- Yes.
- She must get plenty of rest.
- I was alarmed by her appearance.
She has lost some weight,
but that's quite normal.
Later she'll gain, probably too much.
- So I gather.
- Please sit down.
Mrs Castevet makes a vitamin drink
for me from herbs she grows.
All according
to Dr Sapirstein's directions.
He's suspicious of commercially
prepared vitamin pills.
But they're manufactured
under every imaginable safeguard.
True, but pills can sit
for months on a druggist's shelf
- and lose their original potency.
- I hadn't thought of that.
I like having everything natural.
I'll bet expectant mothers chewed
tannis root before vitamin pills.
- Tannis root?
- It's one of the herbs in the drink.
Is it an herb? Can a root be an herb?
- You don't mean anise or orrisroot?
- No, tannis.
Look.
It's good luck, too.
Doesn't look like root matter,
more like mould
or fungus of some kind.
- Is it ever called any other name?
- Not to my knowledge, no.
Tannis. I must look it up
in the encyclopaedia.
- What a pretty holder or charm.
- The Castevets gave it to me.
You seem to be taking better care
of Rosemary than her own parents.
We're very fond of her. And Guy.
Now ex cuse me, I'll have to go.
- My wife is waiting.
- It's nice to have met you.
Oh, don't bother, Rosemary.
We'll meet again, I'm sure.
I just noticed he has pierced ears.
Pierced ears and piercing eyes.
What's she like?
Nosy. Funny.
Guy's gotten very close to them.
I suppose they've become
sort of parent figures for him.
- And you?
- I...I don't know.
Sometimes they're too friendly.
Hey, what a surprise.
How are you, Hutch? Good to see you.
- You're the surprise. What happened?
- They had a rewrite.
- Stay where you are. Nobody move.
- Would you like some coffee?
Love some!
- Loot!
- Congratulations are in order.
- Wonderful, isn't it?
- When's the baby due?
June 28th. Dr Sapirstein delivered
two of Hutch's grandchildren.
- Really?
- Mm.
I met your neighbour. Roman Castevet.
Oh, did you?
Funny old duck, isn't he?
- He has pierced ears.
- You're kidding?
No, I saw.
We haven't seen you lately,
but I'm so busy and Ro 's pregnant
so we haven't seen anyone.
- Let's have dinner soon.
- You're not going?
- Thanks for the coffee.
- Thanks for coming.
This isn't mine. It must be yours.
Right. Have you thought about names,
or is it too soon?
Andrew or Douglas for a boy,
Melinda or Sarah for a girl.
- Sarah?
- Is there another of these?
- I don't see it, Hutch.
- No, it's not here.
I probably left it at the
City Centre. I'll stop back there.
- Let's have that dinner, shall we?
- Next week.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- That was a nice surprise.
- Guess what he said.
- What?
- I look terrible.
Good old Hutch.
Spreading cheer wherever he goes.
I'm going to get a paper, honey.
- He's a professional crepehanger.
- He's not.
Then he's a top-ranking amateur.
Hello. She's not feeling too well.
I think she's asleep.
All right.
Oh, she could be, yeah.
All right, can you hold on a minute?
It's Hutch. He wants to speak to you.
I told him you were resting
but he said it couldn't wait.
- Hutch?
- Dear, do you go out at all?
Well, I...I haven't
been going out, why?
Can you meet me tomorrow morning
in front of the Time-Life Building?
If you want me to.
What is it? Can't you tell me now?
I' d rather not.
We can have an early lunch.
- That would be nice.
- Good. 11 o ' clock?
OK. Oh, did you find your glove?
No.
Good night, Rosemary. Sleep well.
You, too. Good night.
- What was that?
- He wants to talk to me.
- What about?
- I don't know. He wouldn't say.
Those boys' adventure stories
are going to his head.
Where are you meeting him?
Uh, Time and Life Building
tomorrow at 11 o ' clock.
You're pregnant, I've got the yens.
- I'm getting an ice-cream. Want one?
- I' d love one.
- Vanilla?
- OK.
- Hi.
- I won't have my drink now.
Fine, dear. Take it later.
Buzz me when you get back, huh?
Pain, begone.
I will have no more of thee.
- Yes?
- Is this Edward Hutchins' apartment?
- Yes. Who is this?
- My name is Rosemary Woodhouse.
I had an appointment
with Mr Hutchins. Is he there?
- Hello?
- He was taken ill this morning.
- Taken ill?
- Yes.
He's in a coma
at St Vincent's Hospital.
That's awful. I just spoke
to him last night about 10.30.
- I spoke to him at 11.
- Who is this?
You don't know me.
I'm Grace Cardiff, Hutch's friend.
- Do they know what's causing it?
- No, they don't know yet.
He's totally unresponsive.
Oh, I'm going to the hospital now.
- Is there anything I can do?
- Not really.
All right, thank you.
No! This is what I call
the long arm of coincidence!
I said to myself,
if Rosemary's going out,
I might as well
do some Christmas shopping.
Now here you are, here I am.
Isn't that something?
Aw, darling, what's the matter?
You feel all right?
You poor thing.
You know what? I think we better
be going home now. What do you say?
- No, you have your shopping to do.
- Ah, there's two more weeks.
It'll stop any day now.
It's like a wire
inside me tightening.
Usually older women with less
flexible joints have this trouble.
- I'm not going out.
- You don't have to.
One minute to go!
Rosemary, meet Dr Shand.
He used to be a famous dentist.
- He made the chain for your charm.
- Oh, how do you do?
Come on, sweetie.
Put this wonderful hat on.
Doctor, come over here.
- Minnie, Minnie!
- Happy New Year.
- Have a good year.
- Happy New Year.
To 1966!
The year one!
What the hell are you doing?
Planning the menu. We're having
a party a week from Saturday.
It's for our old...
I mean, our young friends.
Minnie and Roman are not invited.
Neither is Laura-Louise.
Nor is Dr Sapirstein.
It's a very special party.
You have to be under 60 to get in.
Well...for a minute there, I didn't
think I was going to make it.
You'll make it.
You can be bartender.
Oh, swell. Do you really think
it's such a good idea?
It's the best idea
I've had in months.
Shouldn't you check
with Dr Sapirstein?
I'm giving a party,
not swimming the English Channel.
What about the pain?
Oh, haven't you heard?
lt'll go away in a day or two.
That looks interesting.
We're having some people over.
You feel up to entertaining?
Yes. These are old friends
that I haven't seen in a long time.
- They don't even know I'm pregnant.
- I'll give you a hand if you like.
No, thank you, Minnie,
but I can manage.
It's a buffet,
and we'll get a bartender, so...
I'll help take the coats.
No, really, you do too much
for me as it is.
Well, let me know
if you change your mind.
Drink your drink, hon.
I' d rather not.
Not right this minute.
I'll drink it in a little while.
- It don't do to let it stand.
- No, I won't.
You go back,
I'll bring the glass back later.
I'll wait. Save you the walk.
No, it makes me very nervous when
people watch me cook. Now, scoot.
Don't let it stand too long,
it'll lose its vitamins.
You dirty, stinking secret-keeper.
Congratulations!
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- Hey, Rosie.
- Yeah?
Bob and Leo got stuck at
another party but they'll be over.
Fine.
Oh, Rosie, it's a fantastic house!
Hi.
- It's been so long.
- You look like a piece of chalk.
You make him feed you, love.
- Adrian Marcato lived here.
- And the Trench sisters.
They ate children.
He doesn't just mean they ate them.
He means they ate them.
I make their first one strong
to get them happy, eh?
Rosie, do you feel OK?
You look tired.
Thanks for the understatement.
How do you like CC Hill?
Isn't he a dream boy?
I'm not going to him.
You're not?
I've got another doctor
named Sapirstein.
- Oh, congratulations, Papa.
- Thanks. Nothing to it.
- I'll take that dip inside.
- Oh, yeah, please. See my flowers?
Yeah. Elise, will you give me a hand?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Is the other guy still blind?
Donald Baumgart? You know who he is.
The boy Zoe Piper lives with.
- He's writing a play.
- Is he still blind?
Yeah. He's going through hell
trying to adjust.
He dictates and Zoe writes.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just had a cramp for a minute.
- Don't cry.
- It's good for her.
Let her cry it out. It's all right,
darling. Sit down, sit down.
- Out, out!
- Let me in.
- Girls only.
- I want to see Rosemary.
- She's busy.
- I have to wash these...
Use the bathroom.
It hurts so much.
I'm so afraid the baby's gonna die.
When did the pain start?
In November.
- November?!
- What?
You have been in pain since November,
and he's not helping?
He says it's gonna stop.
- Why don't you see another doctor?
- No, he's very good.
He was on Open End.
He sounds like a sadistic nut.
Rosemary, pain like that is a
warning that something isn't right.
Go see Dr Hill.
Go see anybody besides that...that...
- That nut.
- Don't go on suffering like this.
I won't have an abortion.
Nobody's telling you to.
Just see another doctor.
The thing to do now is move.
- Guy?
- Yeah?
I'm going to Dr Hill Monday morning.
Dr Sapirstein
is either lying, or he's...
I don't know, out of his mind.
Pain like this is a warning
something's wrong.
- Rosemary...
- I'm not drinking Minnie's drink.
I want vitamins and pills
like everyone else.
I haven't drunk it for three days.
I've thrown it away.
- You've what?
- I've made my own drink.
Is that what those bitches
were giving you in there?
- And is that their hint for today?
- They're my friends...
They're not very bright bitches
who should mind their own business!
They said get a second opinion.
Rosemary, you know who Dr Hill is?
He's a Charlie nobody.
That's who he is!
I'm tired of hearing
how great Dr Sapirstein is.
We'll have to pay Sapirstein,
pay Hill. It's out of the question.
No, I'm not changing.
I just wanna get a second opinion.
I won't let you do it, Ro.
I mean, because it's, uh...
it's not fair to Sapirstein.
Not fair to...?
What are you talking about?
What about what's fair to me?
You want a second opinion?
You tell Sapirstein
and let him decide who gives it.
No! I want Dr Hill!
- At least have that much courtesy...
- If you won't pay, I'll...
Ro?
- Rosemary? What is it?
- It stopped.
- What?
- The pain stopped just like that.
- Stopped?
- Stopped.
What was in that drink you made?
- Uh...eggs, milk, sug...sugar.
- What else?
What else?
Come on, Rosemary, for Christ's sake,
what else was in that drink?
It's alive! Guy, it's moving!
It's alive! It's all right!
- Feel. Feel.
- Oh, yeah, I felt it.
- Don't be scared. It won't bite you.
- It's wonderful. It really is.
I feel it kicking. It's alive!
It's moving!
I'll, uh, clean up some of this mess.
Watch the walls.
- Thanks, boys. Have one on the baby.
- Thank you very much.
What's that for?
- This is my hospital suitcase.
- Honey, you got three weeks.
Yes? Hello, Mrs Cardiff.
No.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Yes, of course I will.
Hutch is dead.
I feel awful. All this time,
I didn't even think of him.
Doctor. Doris, we'll see you later.
I beg your pardon. I'm Mrs Woodhouse.
I knew your father.
- You're Rosemary?
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you. This is my sister.
- How do you do?
- And my husband.
- How do you do?
- Sorry to be late.
- Ex cuse me.
- Yes?
- I'm Grace Cardiff.
I was hoping to meet you.
I was going to mail this,
but I thought you' d be here.
- What is it?
- A book.
Hutch regained consciousness
and thought it was the next morning.
- You had the appointment?
- Oh, yes.
I wasn't there, but he told the
doctor to make sure you got the book.
Thank you.
Oh, and I'm to tell you
the name is an anagram.
- The name of the book?
- Apparently.
He was delirious,
so it's hard to be sure.
I heard you come in.
It wasn't very long.
I was late. I couldn't get a taxi.
Oh, what a shame.
Oh, you got mail already?
Somebody gave it to me.
Here. I'll hold it. Book?
I know that house!
The Gilmores used to live there.
- Oh?
- Yeah.
I've been there lots of times.
Grace...that's my favourite name.
- Yes.
- You need anything?
- No, thank you.
- Take a nap.
- I'm going to.
- Goodbye.
"Born in Glasgow in 1846,
"he was soon after
brought to New York.
"He resided for several years
in the United St...
"He was attacked by a mob
outside the Bram..."
Outside, not in the lobby.
There are no witches. Not really.
The name is an anagram.
Now, that really makes sense.
Poor Hutch.
What's with the chain?
What's the matter?
- You all right?
- I'm fine.
Oh.
- Oh, thank you.
- How was the funeral?
OK.
I got the shirt
that was in the New Yorker.
I got that shirt that
was in the New Yorker.
That's nice.
Do you know who Roman really is?
- What do you mean?
- Adrian Marcato 's son.
- What?
- Come here.
I want to show you something.
Roman Castevet
is Steven Marcato rearranged.
It's from Hutch.
Look.
And look here. There he is
when he was 13. See the eyes?
- Coincidence.
- In the same house?
And look. Look here.
"Soon after that in August, 1886,
his son Steven was born."
1886, got it? That makes him 79 now.
No coincidence.
No, I guess not. He's Steven Marcato,
all right. Poor old geezer.
With a crazy father like that, no
wonder he switched his name around.
- You don't think he's the same?
- What do you mean, a witch?
Ro, are you kidding? Oh, Ro, honey.
His father was a martyr to it.
Do you know how he died?
Honey, it's 1966.
This was published in 1933.
There were covens in Europe.
That's their name, the congregation.
Covens in Europe, America,
Australia and one right here.
The parties with the singing
and the flute and the chanting,
- those are Sabbaths.
- Don't get ex cited.
Read what they do.
They use blood in their rituals.
And the most powerful
is baby's blood.
- They use the flesh, too.
- For God's sakes!
They're not entering this apartment
again or coming near the baby.
They're old people with old friends!
Dr Shand happens
to play the recorder!
I'm not taking any chances.
We'll sublet, move out.
We are not.
We'll talk about it later.
I don't think you ought
to read any more of that.
- Just this last chapter.
- Not today.
Look. Your hands are shaking.
Come on. Give it to me.
I mean it, now. Give it to me.
Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.
- What was the name? Marchado?
- Marcato.
He told me
his father was an importer.
I understand how disturbed you must
be with him for a neighbour.
I don't want anything to do with him.
I can't take the slightest chance.
Any mother would feel the same.
Is there any chance that Minnie put
something harmful in those drinks?
No, Rosemary.
I' d have seen evidence long ago.
I won't take anything else from them.
I can give you some pills that'll be
adequate these last few weeks.
In a way, this may be the answer
to Minnie and Roman's problem, too.
- What do you mean?
- Roman's very ill.
Confidentially, he has no more
than a month or two left.
He wanted to visit
his favourite cities.
They didn't want to offend you
by leaving before the birth.
I'm sorry to hear that.
He' d be extremely embarrassed
if he knew you found out.
Suppose we do this.
I'll tell him to leave on Sunday.
I'll say I spoke to you.
- Will they leave on Sunday?
- I'll see to it.
Our thoughts are gonna be with you
till you're all happy and thin again,
your sweet little boy or girl
laying safely in your arms.
- Thanks for everything.
- Make Guy send us lots of pictures.
Yes.
I won't wish you luck
because you won't need it.
You'll have a happy life.
Have a good trip
and come back safely.
Perhaps. But I may stay in Dubrovnik
or Pescara or maybe Majorca.
- We shall see, we shall see.
- Come back.
- Bye, Minnie.
- Yeah.
Goodbye, Roman. Bye-bye. Take care.
- Kennedy Airport, Pan Am Building.
- Bye!
Bye, Roman.
Oh, boy.
- Where's my book?
- Oh, I put it in the garbage.
What?
I didn't want you upsetting yourself.
Guy, Hutch gave me that book.
He left it to me.
- I wasn't thinking of that.
- That's terrible.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking about Hutch.
Watch out, lady!
"In some cults, it was believed
"that a personal possession
of the victim was necessary
"and spells cannot be cast without
one of the victim's belongings."
- Yeah?
- Is this Donald Baumgart?
- That's right.
- This is Rosemary Woodhouse,
Guy Woodhouse's wife.
- Oh, yes.
- I want to know...
You must be a happy lady,
living in the Bram...
- I wanted to know how you are.
- Well, bless your heart.
Guy Woodhouse's wife, huh?
Well, I'm splendid.
I've only broke six glasses today.
Guy and I are both very unhappy
that he got his break
because of your misfortune.
Ah, what the hell.
That's the way it goes, right?
I'm sorry I didn't come along
that day he came to visit you.
Visit? No... Oh, you mean
the day we met for drinks?
Yes, that's what I meant.
By the way,
he has something of yours, you know.
What do you mean?
- Don't...don't you know?
- No.
Didn't you miss anything that day?
You...you don't mean my tie, do you?
Yes.
Well, he's got mine,
and I've got his.
- He can have it back.
- I'm sorry...
Doesn't matter to me now
what colour tie I wear.
- I thought he' d only borrowed it.
- No, no. It was a trade.
- Or...do you think he stole it?
- I have to hang up now.
I just wanted to know
if there' d been any improvement.
No, there isn't.
It was nice of you to call.
- You aren't in labour?
- No, but I have to see the doctor.
But he has to leave at five,
and there is Mrs Byron.
- I'm sure he'll see you. Sit down.
- Thank you.
- How is it out there?
- Oh, awful. 94.
- See you next week.
- Yes, I will.
- You're due any day, aren't you?
- Tuesday.
Smart to get it over with
before August.
Mrs Byron? He'll see you right after.
Well, let's see, um...July the 10th?
- What time?
- Four o ' clock?
- Fine.
- All right. See you then.
- Thank you. Bye-bye. Good luck.
- Thank you.
That smells nice. What is it?
Oh, my... It's called Detchema.
It's better than your regular,
if you don't mind my saying.
That was a good luck charm.
I threw it away.
Good. Maybe the doctor
will follow your example.
- Dr Sapirstein?
- Yes. The aftershave.
Well, it isn't, is it? I don't think
he has a good luck charm.
Anyway, he has the same smell
once in a while.
And when he does... Oh, boy.
Haven't you ever noticed?
No.
Maybe you thought it was your own
you were smelling.
What is it, a chemical thing?
Will you ex cuse me a moment, please?
My husband is waiting outside.
I have to go and tell him something.
I'll be back in a minute.
- Dr Hill's office.
- Dr Hill, please.
Would you like to leave a message?
Um, yes.
My name is Rosemary Woodhouse.
Woodhouse. Would you ask him to
call me back right away, please?
Uh...my number is 475-2598.
It's an emergency.
I'm in a phone booth.
All right.
Quickly, please, Dr Hill, call me.
Oh, oh, really?
Did he really say that?
Oh, he didn't say that?
What else was it that he said?
Oh, that's wonderful.
That's wonder... That's marvellous.
Yes. Dr Hill?
- Rosemary Woodhouse?
- Yes.
- Are you Dr Hill's patient?
- No.
Um, yes, I mean,
well, I've seen him once.
Um, please tell him he has
to speak to me. It's important.
- Tell him to call me, hm?
- All right.
Thank you.
All of them. All of them.
All in it together. All of them.
All of them witches.
Don't worry, little Andy or Jenny,
I'll kill them before
I let them touch you.
Yes. Dr...
- Mrs Woodhouse?
- Yes!
Oh, thank you,
thank you for calling me.
I thought you were in California.
No. No, l-I've been to another
doctor, and he isn't good, Dr Hill.
He's been lying to me and giving me
unusual kinds of drinks and capsules.
The baby's due on Tuesday.
Remember you told me June 28th?
- I want you to deliver it.
- Mrs Woodhouse...
Please, let me talk to you.
Let me explain what's been going on.
I can't stay too long here.
They'll be coming, looking for me.
Dr Hill? Dr Hill, there's a plot...
I know that sounds crazy.
You're probably thinking,
"This girl has flipped,"
but I haven't flipped,
Dr Hill, I swear, by all the saints.
There are plots against people,
aren't there?
- I suppose there are.
- There's one against me and my baby.
- Come see me tomorrow after five.
- Now! Right now.
Mrs Woodhouse, I'm home. I've
been up since yesterday morning...
I beg you. I beg you.
I can't stay here.
- My office at eight o ' clock.
- Thank you!
- Oh, wait! Dr Hill?
- Yes?
- My husband may call you...
- I'm not gonna speak to anyone.
- I'm gonna take a nap.
- Thank you.
Keep the change.
Uh, driver, please,
could you wait and watch until...
until I'm inside the door?
He lied.
He said we were going to Hollywood.
The worst thing is he's involved.
He sleeps in pyjamas now.
He never used to.
He's probably hiding a mark.
They give you marks when you join...
all sorts of rituals.
They hold Sabbaths there.
You could hear them.
Guy, my husband,
said it was Dr Shand,
one of them playing a recorder.
Now, how did he know it was Dr Shand
unless he was there with them?
Um, they're very clever people.
They planned everything
from the beginning.
They probably made
some deal with Guy.
They gave him success
and he promised them our baby
to use in their rituals.
I know this sounds crazy,
but I've...l've got books here. Look.
There was another actor like him,
Donald Baumgart,
they put a spell on him.
They cast a spell on him and made him
blind so Guy could get his part.
Look, here.
I had this friend, Edward Hutchins,
a writer. He wrote stories for boys.
He was my good friend
since I first came to New York.
- May I keep this?
- Yes, please.
And, look, anyway,
once Mr Hutchins came to visit me...
It was the time
I was having this pain, Doctor.
I was suffering so... You can't
imagine how much I was suffering,
and they wouldn't help me.
They were giving me a drink
with tannis root in it.
Also witches' stuff, tannis root.
Hutch came and immediately
saw something was wrong.
He...he knew about witches.
Guy rushed in with his makeup on,
which he never did.
They probably called him to come home
and steal one of Hutch's belongings.
He took his glove
and they put a spell on him, too.
Put him in a coma.
Three months later he died.
Maybe all this is coincidence,
but one thing is for sure,
they have a coven and want my baby.
Certainly seems that way.
I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.
I don't believe in witchcraft,
but there are plenty
of crazy people in this city.
- The doctor's name is Shand?
- No, Dr Shand is one of them.
- The doctor's name is Sapirstein.
- Abraham Sapirstein?
Yeah.
- Do you know him?
- I've met him once or twice.
To look at him, you' d never think...
No, you wouldn't.
Not in a million years.
Would you like to go
into Mount Sinai now, this evening?
Yeah, I would love to.
Would that be possible?
It's difficult, but we'll try.
I want you to lie down
and get some rest.
Thanks. Anything they've got,
even a broom closet would be fine.
I hope we can do better than that.
I'll see what I can do,
then I'll check you over.
Oh, should I undress now?
No. It'll take about a half hour.
You just lie down, rest.
God bless Dr Hill.
Everything's going to be
OK now, Andy or Jenny.
We're going to be in a nice,
clean hospital with no visitors.
Monsters.
Monsters.
Unspeakable. Unspeakable.
I was sleeping.
Come with us quietly, Rosemary.
Don't argue or make a scene.
If you say
anything more about witches
we'll take you to a mental hospital.
You don't want that, do you?
So put your shoes on.
We just want to take you home.
No one's going to hurt you.
Or the baby. Put your shoes on.
She's fine now.
- We're going to go home and rest.
- That's all it takes.
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Glad I could help, sir.
It's a shame you had to come here.
Good evening, Mrs Woodhouse.
Mrs Woodhouse!
Mrs Woodhouse!
- Come on, open up, Ro.
- Go to hell!
- Come on, honey.
- You promised them the baby!
I didn't promise them anything!
- Rosemary, you're...
- You, too!
- Hello?
- Elise?
- Mrs Dunstan is out.
- Who is this? Where is she?
- At the movies.
- This is Rosemary.
Ask her to call me
when she gets home.
It's terribly urgent.
Don't...don't forget.
- Don't worry. I'll tell her.
- Thank you.
- We don't want to hurt you, Ro.
- We're your friends, Rosemary.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Honest there isn't.
- This is just a mild sedative.
- I wouldn't let anyone...
Help me!
- Oh, Ro, baby.
- Somebody help me!
Wait a minute. Wait a minute now.
- We're in labour here.
- Here?
You'll be all right, baby. You're
going to be perfectly all right.
There were supposed to be doctors,
hospitals!
Everything...clean and sterile!
Hello? She isn't here, Elise.
Oh, Andy... Andy or Jenny...
I...l'm sorry, my little darling.
Forgive me.
Hi.
Hi.
Is it all right?
Yes, it's fine.
- What is it?
- A boy.
Really? A boy?
- And it's all right?
- Yes.
Where is it?
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, gee, what a start you gave me.
My goodness.
The baby, where is it?
Oh, uh, you wait here one minute.
Where's my baby?
Uh, I'll go find Dr Abe.
Just wait.
Where's the baby?
- Where is it?
- Honey...
There were complications, but nothing
that will affect future births.
It's...
Dead. It was in the wrong position.
In hospital
I might have done something.
Honey, we can have others.
You can try again in a few months.
When you're better.
No. I don't believe you.
You're both lying.
You're lying! It didn't die!
You took it! You're lying!
You're witches! You're lying!
You're lying! You're lying!
You're lying!
Abe says it's called...pre-partum.
I don't know.
It's some kind of a hysteria.
Boy, you were really kapow,
out of your mind.
Uh, I know where you got the idea
that Minnie and Roman were witches,
but, um, how come you thought
that Abe and I joined the party?
Let's face it, darling,
you had the...pre-partum crazies.
Now you're gonna rest
and you're gonna get over them.
I know this is the worst thing
that ever happened to you,
but now everything's gonna be roses.
Paramount's right where we want them,
Universal's interested,
and we're gonna blow this town
and be in beautiful Beverly
with a pool and a spice garden,
the whole schmeer, and kids, too, Ro.
Scout's honour.
You heard what Abe said.
Now, I got to run now and get famous.
Let me...see your shoulder.
Let me see your shoulder.
- Are you kidding?
- Your left shoulder.
All right. Anything you say.
I generally prefer doing this
to music. Left shoulder.
Right shoulder.
And that's as far as I go
without a blue light.
The high pressure area
causing this heat...
And will be staying with us
through the week.
It will be overcast
upstate New York as well
with the possibility
of thunder showers tonight
clearing by tomorrow night.
All you people leaving the city
this weekend should find it hot.
Do you hear a baby crying?
Why, no, I don't, dear.
Now, into your bed now.
It's time for you to take your pill.
Did you turn the air conditioner off?
Well, you mustn't do that, dear.
People are actually dying,
it's so hot.
What do you do with the milk?
Why, uh, throw it away.
Your pill, Rosemary.
Hello, girls.
95 out.
Some new people
moved on in up in eight.
Do they have a baby?
How' d you know that?
I heard it crying.
Oh, wait a minute.
- Oh, no. Don't do that.
- Why not?
Uh, a little messy, that's all.
Easy, easy.
Got her too high.
Oh, hell, Hayato.
You're making fun of me.
You're pulling my leg, like we say.
Rosemary, go back to bed. You know
you're not supposed to be up.
- The mother?
- Rosemary...
Shut up. You're in Dubrovnik.
I don't hear you.
What have you done to it?
What have you done to its eyes?
He has his father's eyes.
What are you talking about?
Guy's eyes are normal.
What have you done to him,
you maniacs?!
Satan is his father, not Guy.
He came up from hell
and begat a son of mortal woman.
- Hail, Satan.
- Hail, Satan.
Satan is his father,
and his name is Adrian.
He shall overthrow the mighty
and lay waste their temples.
He shall wreak vengeance in the name
of the burned and the tortured!
- Hail, Adrian!
- Hail, Adrian!
Hail, Satan! Hail, Satan!
Hail, Satan!
He chose you. Out of all the women
in the whole world, he chose you.
He wanted you to be
the mother of his only son.
His power is stronger than stronger!
His might shall last
longer than longer!
- Hail, Satan!
- No!
It can't be! No!
- Go look at his hands.
- And his feet.
Oh, God!
- God is dead! Satan lives!
- Hail, Satan!
- The year is one!
- Hail, Satan!
- The year is one and God is done!
- Oh, God!
- The year is one!
- Hail, Adrian!
Hail, Satan!
Why don't you help us out, Rosemary?
Be a real mother to Adrian.
You don't have to join
if you don't want to.
Just be a mother to your baby.
Minnie and Laura-Louise are too old.
It's not right.
Think about it, Rosemary.
Oh, God!
Oh, shut up or we'll kill you,
milk or no milk.
You shut up. Rosemary's his mother.
Show some respect.
Come, my friend.
Come see him. Come see the child.
What would you like to drink?
They promised you wouldn't be hurt,
and you haven't been, really.
I mean, supposing you had the baby
and you lost it.
Wouldn't that be the same?
And we're getting
so much in return, Ro.
Oh, Guy, let me introduce
you to Argyron Stavropoulos.
How proud you must be.
Is this the mother?
Why in the name of...
- Here, drink this.
- What's in it? Tannis root?
Just plain, ordinary Lipton's tea.
You drink it.
- Get away from here. Roman!
- You're rocking him too fast.
Sit down! Put her where she belongs.
You're rocking him too fast.
That's why he's crying.
- Mind your own business.
- Let Rosemary rock him.
- Sit with the others.
- She's liable to...
Sit down with the others,
Laura-Louise.
Rock him.
You're trying to get me
to be his mother.
Aren't you his mother?
