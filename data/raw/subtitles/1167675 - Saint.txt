Your parents just told you...
...he doesn't exist
Offer up the following when
there is a full moon.
Gold, silver, meat, 
virgins, wax, servants.
My name is St. Nicholas.
Goert, go and check the pigs.
Goert, listen to me.
Don't forget to put your coat on.
Where can St. Nicholas put your present?
- He'll have to wait.
Get a move on.
There, there. Calm down.
Everything's fine.
There, there.
St. Nicholas.
The fire went out.
Number three.
Amsterdam: the present day
That's when St. Nicholas knew
what to get, a present for in bed.
I wonder what that is.
So, have fun and don't make too much
noise. From a friend who's into toys.
I can come by if you want.
Read the instructions first.
You bastard.
Come on guys. Do that in your own time.
Congratulations. That's our sixth dildo,
breaking last year's record of five.
Funnily enough,
St. Nicholas hasn't forgotten Frank.
No way. That's a mistake.
How about some clean underwear?
l love big boxes.
St. Nicholas must hold you very dear.
There will be no party for Frank.
This year he'll only get spanked.
Speak up, Frank.
So, everyone can hear you.
Louder.
You have betrayed St. Nicholas' trust,
because you're full of lust.
Frank, you just got the sack,
no need for you to come back.
Not a penny St. Nicholas will spend,
rest assured, this is the end.
Who's calling the emergency services?
I warned you.
I'll give you two euros for the whole box.
I hope St. Nicholas kept the receipt.
I've got this already.
There is no better way to demonstrate
the theory of action is reaction.
Loser.
You should have just made a wish list.
- Now you've got stuff you don't want.
If you need a good cry, we understand.
And leave you alone with all those
bad girls? I don't think so.
Be sure to be on time. Eight o'clock sharp.
- When will my scooter be fixed?
Prick.
- What's gotten into him?
It's kind of harsh to break up like that.
Why didn't you just text him?
- I could have put nude photos online.
You have nude photos?
- I'll email them to you.
You'd been going out for six months.
He shouldn't have messed around
with that girl in the bicycle shed.
Really?
- According to Laura. But she 
still believes in St. Nicholas.
I wanted to break up anyway.
She's had a new guy for three months.
New guy? Who?
- They met at yoga class and hit it off.
He works in a tattoo parlour.
You've been cheating on him for three months?
- No, no... Two. And a half...
Were you the girl in the bicycle shed?
You're blond.
And you play hockey.
- Don't be daft.
Who are you sleeping with these days?
- Lisa doesn't do sex before marriage.
Well, guess who's the odd 
woman out in Amsterdam.
Are there any cute guys in your class?
- Not really.
You can borrow this if you want.
Give it to St. Nicholas' horse.
St. Nicholas could use it.
He has a staff.
- With that curly bit at the end.
I'll see you tomorrow.
If you're still around that is.
Where are you going?
- I've still got to buy presents.
Bye.
- Bye.
I'm glad we don't have
that commercial nonsense at home.
What does she mean
by 'if you're still around'?
Haven't you heard Laura's story?
-About Frank and the bicycle shed?
No, about St. Nicholas.
- No, what about it?
There's a full moon tonight.
There's a full moon on December 5
only every 23 years.
And? Great isn't it?
Legend has it St. Nicholas is out to get
you if there's a full moon on December 5.
Only misbehaved kids, right?
No, he's not that fussy.
Kids, adults...
Laura says he cuts your throat, then rips 
your heart or eyes out with his bare hands.
How does she get these stories?
Some colleague of her dad's at the police.
Vivid imagination.
Who thinks of these things?
Do you want to come by?
I'm babysitting my brother.
No, not tonight.
Slave to commerce are we?
- I've got to write five poems.
I'll have that joint by myself then. See you.
Watch out who you open the front door to.
It might be the 'evil' St. Nicholas.
What the hell are you doing here?
Sorry.
- You gave me a fright.
Don't come here. Sophie might see you.
- Why not? 
She dumped me. 
- But she's still one of my best friends.
You didn't care a while ago.
I was drunk.
After two Breezers?
- I can't help it.
I must say she dumped me in style.
Fancy a necklace?
- Did you know she has someone else?
When I saw her nipple piercing I knew.
Why didn't you dump her then?
- Have you ever seen Sophie naked?
You men have a one track mind.
- True.
How much beer can you handle?
- I can't figure out why she didn't tell me.
You didn't tell her about us.
- Neither have you.
Complicated, isn't it?
- Indeed.
Are your parents in?
- Why?
Then you can give me your present.
- No, I don't want to now.
What?
Us.
I'm just not sure.
- Are you going to dump me too?
Who said we were going steady?
Great. I came all this way...
Listen, I just need a bit of time.
Okay. I'll be off then.
You're just the same as your friend:
a stuck-up Amsterdam-South girl.
Come on.
- Bye.
Hey Goert, you just murdered four bottles
of wine.
Try justifying that as self-defence.
Goert, can I speak to you for a minute?
Very funny, guys. Very funny.
This is awkward. Goert. We've 
known each other for, what - 20, 25 years?
I'm worried about you.
Have you ever considered
getting professional help?
Are you saying I need it?
In my 40 years here, I've never seen
anyone execute their St. Nicholas present.
Admit it, it's slightly odd.
The police must do something.
We're here to protect the people.
I've read your report.
Ban all St. Nicholas activities?
Double all police patrols on December 5?
I thought you were pulling my leg.
Everything in the report is based on facts.
You're scaring the hell out of everyone
with this stuff.
Some people out there believe
that nonsense.
One of the reasons I joined the police
was to protect people from evil.
If the time came,
I wanted to make a difference.
And believe me, that time has come.
December 5 will never be the same
if we do nothing.
Goert, what happened 40 years ago
can't be undone.
Not now, not in the future.
Take a couple of days off.
Go somewhere else and celebrate.
I can't go. It's my duty.
- Alright. I'm putting you on leave
for the whole month.
- You can't do that!
I don't want to see you till January.
Nicholas
A report, by Goert Hoekstra
Has the battery gone too?
- Let's hope not.
7 1-43 over.
7 1-43.
- Where are you exactly?
We're bobbing around on the Ij.
Is anyone coming?
The 44 is on the Amstel. They're
on their way, but it may take a while.
Okay. Tell them to hurry up.
We want to go home.
Bobbing around isn't all that.
I've got to deliver presents to four 
neighbours. That'll take a while.
A boat?
- Nothing at all.
You'd be mad to go out in a boat
in this weather.
What?
I can smell... As if something burned out.
Is that the 44?
- No, it's a truck in the North.
That smell.
Shit.
- What?
That can't be a boat.
It's coming directly at us. And fast too.
This is 7 1-43, over.
This is urgent. This is 7 1-43, over.
Damn it.
I told you, it's that blasted battery.
It's Frank.
I'm sorry about earlier.
I was pissed off with Sophie.
I was a bit rude too, sorry.
If you and I don't get together,
it doesn't matter.
I understand. I mean, I'm not exactly
easy to get along with.
What happened?
- Stupid presents. I just cut my finger.
I've always said we should abolish
St. Nicholas. All that nonsense.
But then you won't make any money.
- I'll dress up as Father Christmas.
I'll call you back. I need to get a plaster.
- Okay. Be careful.
You too.
When are you going to clean up
this mess? I can't even read tarot.
Tomorrow. I'm almost done.
- Do you really have to go out?
You're asking St. Nicholas if he has to
work tonight? He can't just skip a year.
Maybe not a bad idea.
This St. Nicholas keeps his word.
- It makes me uncomfortable.
Have you been reading the tarot?
Something strange in your horoscope?
I'm not feeling well.
And that's why I should stay home?
Be careful. It's slippery and misty.
And all the bad first year students
will be sitting on my lap.
It's hard work, but someone's got to do it.
Don't drink as much as last year.
I could barely clean your beard.
I'll get you some chocolate letters
and marzipan.
Be careful.
-As always.
It's the day he died.
Who?
- St. Nicholas.
People think it's his birthday,
but he died on December 5.
Isn't that great? Dying on your birthday.
He was brutally murdered.
Now, he's back for revenge.
Come on, Goert. Cheer up.
He's a children's friend
who brings presents from Spain.
Must you keep that thing on all night?
Not exactly social.
I might be needed.
- Drinking and working?
Do you know why we give presents?
That's pretty obvious, right?
Everything's give and take. He takes
the children and not just children...
Well, how about you arrest him then?
A guy with a white beard and red robe.
That shouldn't be too hard.
I'm guessing there are a few hundred
in Amsterdam alone.
I'll recognize the real one straightaway.
I told you it was too small.
- You did that on purpose.
No, it was the only size they had left.
- And it just happened to be your size?
That's better.
Damn it.
- You can pay for that.
He's just pulling your leg.
His girlfriend broke up with him.
Hurry up. We'll be late otherwise.
Next year we're doing things differently.
Bloody hell. What happened here?
That was the P-34.
- Oh, my God.
Hurry up.
Did your dad lend you his car?
- Not really.
You didn't ask him?
- If we bring it back intact, it's fine.
Where are your parents?
- The four of them have gone to Las Palmas.
Why the four of them?
My dad and his mistress
and my mum and her ex-husband.
The modern way!
Do you know where it is?
- Somewhere along the ring road.
Mapping out your route.
- That's how St. Nicholas works.
Does he have GPS on his horse?
- Ready for departure.
We'll be on time.
There will be no messages in rhyme.
This year St. Nicholas
has resulted in record sales.
Despite the recession St. Nicholas sales
rose 10% compared to last year...
...proving St. Nicholas is more popular
than ever, according to retailers.
Fog rapidly setting in
has caused problems for boats.
Trains too...
Quick, quick. Get away.
- Where are you going?
Sophie.
What's wrong? Why are you shouting?
- There's something on the roof.
Some birds maybe, or the neighbours' cat.
They don't have a cat.
- Yes, St. Nicholas just gave them one.
I'm scared.
- Why?
Jasper said St. Nicholas puts the naughty
children in his sack...
...and takes them to Spain.
- Great. That's the end of Jasper then.
Why don't I get presents?
Because we don't celebrate St. Nicholas.
- Why not?
St. Nicholas is a commercial invention,
an excrescence of our affluent society.
Have I misbehaved?
- Timmie, St. Nicholas doesn't exist.
I've told you 100 times.
And Black Peter?
- Neither does he. 
Now go to sleep. Nothing's wrong.
I'll leave the light on.
- Okay.
Damn it. Not again.
There are road works everywhere.
Bloody tube line.
- Doesn't the sat nav include road works?
This detour makes no sense. 
- We'll just go back. Don't worry.
Make a U-turn if possible.
Hello?
- Has he arrived?
Who?
- St. Nicholas, of course. Who else?
I don't know.
I'm bored stiff. Have you finished
opening presents?
I wish. I haven't even finished
writing my poems.
I'll help you. What have you got?
Who's it for?
My dad. What rhymes with 'prostate'?
Does anything else rhyme with 'luck'?
Timmie got out of bed again.
What did you say?
- What rhymes with luck?
Fuck.
- Fuck? This poem's for my mum.
Where are you off to?
We're waiting for you, you know.
You are at an unknown location.
Follow the arrows.
Did you put in the right address?
- Of course.
This doesn't seem like the place
for a student flat.
Did this GPS come with a Happy Meal?
- I need a leak.
Don't forget your sat nav.
You might get lost.
We'll be late, damn it.
Is something burning?
- It's probably my temper.
Colleague.
A horse like that is of course
a unique selling point.
All you need is a couple of Peters.
Fuck. 
My iPhone. I almost finished the game.
- You shouldn't use it in the shower.
The eight o'clock news.
- Shut up.
Where the hell is he? Did his dick
freeze against a lamppost?
Hey, don't tell me you're squeezing
one out.
Sander?
Police. Show your hands.
Open the door now.
You have reached your destination.
I haven't done anything.
These Black Peters.
What did they look like?
One of them resembled Ruud Gullit.
The other looked like Ali B.
You remind me of Pipo the Clown.
I never thought he was funny.
How often do I have to tell you?
I've told you ten times already.
Tell me one more time.
You were dressed up as St. Nicholas
and your friends were Black Peters.
You last saw him at three o'clock?
He dropped by.
- I didn't know that.
Why did he drop by?
- No reason. We just chatted.
Are you lovers?
- Inspector!
I know him from school.
You were chatting to your friend from
school, and then?
He left.
To Sophie?
- No. I don't know.
Sophie was his girlfriend, right?
According to several statements
she dumped him rather casually.
That's no reason to kill someone.
He had every reason to be upset.
- Frank wouldn't do such a thing.
He isn't a murderer.
- What was his behaviour like?
Was he nervous?
- Not at all. Frank wouldn't do it!
That's enough, Inspector.
You know where to find us.
Come, darling.
We're going home.
They killed my friends.
Don't tell me you're seeing Frank?
They're not like us. I've told you so often.
Look what happens.
Shut up, mum.
- You know how your father feels.
When did you last see Sophie?
This morning at school.
How often are you going to ask that?
Oh, yes. When she broke up with you.
I can imagine being so angry
you want to kill her.
You should stop watching Baantjer.
I'll stop watching if you tell me
what you did to her little brother.
Brother?
ok, bring me up to date.
There are two boats at the scene.
No idea what happened.
Does Willy know?
- Doing that now.
And the girl who was murdered?
- We've got a suspect, her ex-boyfriend.
And the other victims?
- Same suspect.
Same suspect? He first kills his 
ex and then his friends?
- Dressed up as St. Nicholas.
He was dressed up as St. Nicholas?
Witnesses say that at 
the time of the murder...
...they saw someone dressed up
as St. Nicholas.
Others say they saw him on a grey horse.
Has he been interrogated? Confessed?
No, he's talking double Dutch.
- What do you mean?
He says Black Peters killed his friends.
Black Peters?
People dressed up as Black Peter?
Maybe the real one. Sorry.
And? Have we any witnesses?
- No. 
Investigators are on the case,
but everyone's on leave.
Do what you can.
And send Van Dijk.
- Van Dijk?
Yes, Van Dijk.
- Ok.
Come in.
Problems?
Can you find Goert Hoekstra?
- Goert? Has he gone missing?
I would like to speak to him.
- It shouldn't be a problem.
Try to keep it... Discrete.
December brings death and devastation.
Many unanswered questions over 
December 5th drama. 
Places to watch: children's homes,
playgrounds, creches, hospitals. 
Children's ward. 
Hello, St. Nicholas.
I was just opening your present.
Is she still awake?
Put her on, please.
Hello, darling.
Has St. Nicholas come by yet?
No, mum has to work.
I'll do that.
Bye, darling.
Shit.
Hi, the power has been cut.
No, the whole floor.
Thanks.
Hi Merel, bad conscience?
- Do you always sneak up on people?
We can't wear squeaky shoes.
What's wrong with the power?
- No idea.
Yousef is having a look.
Do you smell burning too?
- It might be from outside.
Two windows were left open downstairs.
- How come?
In the courtyard. Don't worry.
Did you make this mess?
- I wouldn't dare. 
I don't know what it is,
but I'll clean it up.
Harm?
I want a lawyer.
Who's watching too much Baantjer now?
Where are you taking me?
You're lucky you're going to prison
and not staying here. Watch your head.
Have you called my mum?
- Working on it.
What a mess. How can you live here?
Fancy some sweets?
- No, thanks.
I just had a piece of marzipan.
- Sounds good.
Gingerbread too.
- Do you know what I find odd?
We didn't get a chocolate letter.
- Budget cuts will do that.
I need assistance.
- Urgent?
1 1-01, over. We're chasing a suspect.
What's your position?
- Going towards Westerstraat.
License plate number?
- No license plate. He's on a horse.
A horse?
- Yeah, right. And he's not on the street.
No.
The suspect is approaching Herengracht.
Suspect: age unknown, long white beard
and red robe.
Look, there.
- You've got to be kidding me.
Suspect going towards Brouwersgracht.
Assistance needed.
Anyone near Brouwersgracht?
What are you doing?
- What do you think?
It... It... It's St. Nicholas!
I thought we weren't going to celebrate
St. Nicholas?
Where did he go to?
- He can't have gone far.
Are you okay?
I think so.
Bullets won't harm him, but fire does.
Who are you talking about?
Who are you?
One of the last people to still believe
in St. Nicholas.
How did you uncuff me?
- Ever heard the legend of St. Nicholas?
Urban legend, you mean.
When there's a full moon on December 5
he kills everyone.
Not everyone, but he's not far off.
- Cut the crap.
You've seen what he did to your friends.
What do you know about that?
It's safe here.
Stay in crowded places.
Avoid quiet streets.
Could you explain me something?
No, you're lucky you're still alive.
There's a first aid post nearby.
Get a band aid there.
Do you work for the police?
Are you undercover?
Come on, get off. I don't have all evening.
Not before you tell me
who killed my friends?
I'm asking you one last time.
- Relax.
It's the holiday season.
Are you okay?
It doesn't look like you'll live
to see December 5 next year.
I'm fine.
What are you up to with the boat?
- None of your business.
The ignition hasn't been tuned.
I heard it just now.
Do you know anything about boats?
- Engines.
Okay. Under one condition.
You've got to be kidding me.
Your whole family?
The police didn't believe my story.
They found a tramp, he confessed.
A week later he committed suicide.
At least, that's what they said. 
- And that's not true?
The government had every reason
to cover it up.
The same happened with all
the other murders that night.
There were more?
- Hundreds.
Tonight won't be any different.
He won't rest until
he's turned Amsterdam into a bloodbath.
I know that the press love to
make up conspiracy theories.
However, there's no reason to 
assume that this incident
is linked to any of the
incidents earlier tonight.
But people saw someone dressed up
as St. Nicholas.
We don't know anything about that.
There are bound to be plenty
of St. Nicholas's walking around.
What about the escaped suspect?
Shots were fired.
I can't comment on that now.
One more question.
- That's all for now, thanks.
Chief inspector.
Has a crisis team been set up?
Could this harm our relations with Spain?
One of the residents saw a horse.
Can you confirm that?
It's... Unclear what happened.
- I'm sure you can tell us. 
Ice accretion from a plane? A comet?
Did they flip the car?
- Nothing suggests that.
Shut up about the horse.
I can't tell that to the press.
Several witnesses have...
- It's December 5.
Half the city has seen St. Nicholas
and his horse on the roof.
Let's stay focused.
This nonsense won't get us anywhere.
I'm sure this has a logical explanation.
Find it.
Hello, Mr Mayor.
It looks like it.
I must admit that, yes.
That's what we're trying to do.
I'm afraid our only option is to...
Yes, loud and clear.
Any news about Goert?
- We've found his car, near the canal.
I wouldn't be surprised me if he could tell
us more about the escaped suspect.
Why did he leave his car here?
How do you know all this?
I had never heard about it,
except about that legend.
You can find anything
if you know where to look.
Dusty records in dank basements,
in old monasteries.
In a closed vault under the Westerkerk
I found old pictures
of Niklas's atrocities.
I don't have to tell you that the Catholic
church isn't happy...
...about the myth of St. Nicholas being
based on a murderous, renegade bishop.
What about the bishop of Myra?
An invention to distract us.
He never existed.
That's what I thought.
Here you go.
I also found documents with clues
about how to remove the curse.
Bloody hell. That's dangerous.
What are you up to?
I'm going to blow up his boat.
- His boat?
At midnight. Everyone will be on board.
Take this.
Put it on. lt's going to get cold tonight.
Frank, where are you?
What boat? Did they let you go?
That'll make it worse.
Why not?
Who are you talking to?
- Natasha.
Don't tell me you're talking to Frank.
Stay inside? Why?
Of course I want to believe you.
Shit, It's the police. 
I believe you.
Not easy explaining it, is it?
- She has her doubts.
The fog is getting denser.
We're getting closer.
I don't imagine him docking at
the passenger terminal.
No, you're right.
What's that?
-A map of sixteenth century Amsterdam.
This is his boat.
- No steamboat?
Another lie.
He sails an old schooner.
That's why we put our shoes out.
This is the old harbour.
It hasn't been used since the fifties.
Do you smell that?
What?
- We're close.
What are you doing?
- I'm listening.
It's almost half past eleven.
We only have 30 minutes.
Shit. It's the P34.
- What's that?
A police boat. Hold this.
Hold him, he's still alive.
Police. Put your hands up.
There's someone in the water.
There's no need for guns.
- Hands up, both of you.
What's that?
- It's a life buoy.
Who are you?
- Watch out.
What are you doing here?
What's going on, lads?
- Shit. You're under arrest.
Nice colleagues you've got.
Goddammit me, 
- Holy mackerel.
What are you up to with this?
It's enough to blow Amsterdam up.
Shut up!
Move. Get off the boat. Hurry up.
We haven't done anything.
- Turn right.
Come on, guys. This is going too far.
- Hands behind your back.
Both have been arrested.
Their boat was full of explosives.
What is your position?
I can't really say.
Our GPS isn't working properly.
We're in the southwest,
close to the old wood harbour.
Do you copy, HQ?
Do you copy, HQ?
I thought you had to hand your gun in.
7 1-44 to HQ. Do you copy?
No signal?
I'll ask for a new one from St. Nicholas
next year. We're not far from the quay.
Let me explain, we don't have much time.
- You don't have to explain anything.
The whole force
knows about your obsession.
Keep quiet. I don't want to hear you.
You think it's safe with that boat?
- As long as you don't throw any butts in.
Look at that.
Did you know there was a canal here?
This should get us to the old harbour.
- No idea.
They went straight through that beam.
Smugglers, you think?
- Maybe the P34 ran into them too?
Let's go.
The old harbour?
- They have no idea what they're doing.
HQ, this is 7 1-44. Do you copy?
HQ, this is 71-44. Do you copy?
Still no signal?
- No.
Shouldn't we bring them back first?
We can't let trespassing go unpunished.
This is the only way into the old harbour.
Look.
That's them.
See? Didn't l tell you?
- What are we going to do?
I need to take a leak.
- Pee in your pants.
Fuck!
I want a new radar next year.
- If I were you, I'd ask for a new boat.
Is something burning?
What the hell is that?
Is that it?
I hope they've got
a good insurance policy.
Are you married?
- None of your business.
You're the smart one.
If you ever want to see you family again,
turn around now.
Shut up.
I tried...
Do you hear that?
- Sounds like children. Oh, my God!
Let us go. We're all going to die.
Shouldn't we go back?
That thing Goert always talks about...
Don't tell me you believe in St. Nicholas...
Of course not. But that ship...
Are you okay?
- Couldn't be better.
Delta calling Charlie. 
- Go ahead, Delta.
We're there. ls there anything 
we should look out for?
Anything suspicious.
- Roger that. 
You go that way. We'll go this way.
If there's any news, report immediately.
Team 2 are on their way. 
Five minutes to go. We can still do it.
We've got to go.
These guys are everywhere.
I warned you.
What's that?
-A detonator.
Put those barrels upright.
I never imagined spending 
St. Nicholas like this.
Well, he deserves a present too for once.
The blue wire goes into the blue switch.
And the red one...
Goes into the red switch?
You're lucky I'm not colour blind.
Fuck! Four minutes.
Are you sure it's safe? I mean,
it's not made in China, is it?
Taiwan.
The explosives are from China.
Ok, I've connected the wires.
- Turn the yellow switch.
Yellow switch.
Are you sure?
What now? Lock the rudder and engine on?
- I'm sailing the boat.
- Yeah, right. You can barely 
stand, let alone jump out.
I wasn't planning to.
- Come on, we're not in Baghdad.
We're doing it my way.
No need to act the hero.
Fuck, no time for cigarettes.
Goert, l'm afraid...
...this is not going to work.
Come on. lt's almost midnight.
Fuck. When did that happen?
Police! Show me your hands! Now.
Listen.
- Come out of the water. On the floor.
Put your hands up.
That bomb is about to explode.
Shit, what's that?
Listen to me
- Fuck! It looks like a ship!
This is Delta. We've got a problem.
Where are you?
- 60 metres ahead of you.
Copy. Give me details.
- Two suspects. One arrested, one dead.
And something that looks like...
Did we get him?
Yes, we got him.
Getting presents can be fun, but you
always end up with crap you don't need.
How many?
We're not sure yet.
What's your estimate?
- About 300.
That's more than 42 years ago.
Make it an acceptable number.
I'll do my best, Mr. Mayor.
This isn't something 
to feel guilty about, Johan.
The city learned to live with this
centuries ago.
One day it'll end. But I'm afraid 
we won't live to see that day.
Last night a bus carrying schoolchildren
crashed into the canal.
The search continues for victims.
The fire in the children's ward
of the City Hospital...
...has taken the lives
of around 35 children.
Due to the extreme heat of the fire,
identifying casualties will be impossible.
For 25 years Goert H. worked
in the Amsterdam police force.
We'll never know how many murders
he committed.
His body was found this morning
in the Western Harbour of Amsterdam.
The police hasn't ruled out suicide.
Goert H., who suffered from depression...
St. Nicholas celebrations went smoothly.
Despite some incidents with 
St. Nicholas' helpers...
...it was surprisingly quiet this year.
Hello, Frank.
What are you doing here?
I heard you'll be discharged tomorrow.
Great.
You're lucky to survive.
Others weren't so lucky.
Thanks for reminding me.
We've still got to write a report.
Never a nice task.
When's a good time for you?
- Do it yourself.
You know exactly what happened.
- Of course.
I know you were unlawfully arrested
and kidnapped by a crazy serial killer.
Rubbish. Goert is the only person
who actually did something.
You don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm not the one who's lying here.
Do you really think people want
to hear St. Nicholas really exists?
Trust me. lt's best to let 
sleeping dogs lie.
But you've got a point.
I'll try and clean Goert's 
resume up a bit, okay?
Okay?
This is for you, also on behalf of
the mayor.
As compensation.
Because you missed
all the St. Nicholas celebrations.
I know a good clinic in Switzerland,
specializing in neurosurgery.
Maybe they can help your mum.
Think about it.
Calm down.
It's me.
You were sleeping. A nightmare?
Something like that.
Are you okay?
They didn't let me see you.
Who? Your mum?
- The doctors.
My mum is actually proud of you.
That you defended your friends.
The newspapers say you're a hero.
Don't believe everything you read.
Will you tell me one day?
What?
What really happened.
Maybe.
Or you might have to wait 23 years.
23 years? Why 23 years?
There'll be a full moon on December 5.
I brought you a present.
I'll just unwrap it.
Careful!
