Hey? Hey?
What are you doing?
Oh, you mean the rubble?
We'll clean it right up.
No, no, what are you talking about?
Stop breaking it!
You can't break that. What is this?
Are you crazy? What is that?
A window.
Let me handle it.
You're crazy.
What is this? Why are you making
a hole facing my house?
l don't know.
You'd have to talk to Mr. Víctor.
Okay. Call him,
tell him to come here.
No, Mr. Víctor isn't here.
Give me his cell phone number.
Okay, well, as soon as he returns,
he has to see me right away.
Okay, well, as soon as he returns,
he has to see me right away.
l'll tell him.
Hey, hey! No, no!
You can't go on.
The owner has to talk to me first.
What an awful country, damn it.
Terrible.
The idea is to enter the page
and bam, you see your photo.
Look, look at what an idiot
l look like there.
l don't know if it's a good idea,
for my photo to be the first image.
-You can pick the languages here.
-Right.
Spanish, English, French, German.
Right, careful with the German.
''Deutsche'' is spelt T-S-C-H,
you're missing a ''C'' there.
Okay. Then you have
Japanese and Chinese.
Yes, that's crucial.
Then you have the Kachanovsky seat.
Pretty cool, isn't it?
Stockholm Biennial, 2023.''
Stockholm Biennial, 20023.''
-Yeah, it's right there.
-Oh, okay. Very elegant. Good.
And here, there's a banner
that says:
''Over 500 thousand units
sold around the world.''
Right, l like that, yes.
Here, there's a link
to the Kachanovsky scholarship...
for young designers.
Okay.
Ten, l don't know.
l wanted to add everything...
about your social work,
the aborigines, what do you think?
l don't know if l want
to make propaganda with that.
l think it's a little... excuse me.
Okay, okay, have him wait.
Offer him some coffee. Okay.
Okay, okay, have him wait.
Offer him some coffee. Okay.
Okay, well... it's great, man.
lt's great, run with it.
The concrete threshold at the
door marks the entrance.
Look at how... Leonardo,
good morning.
-How are you?
-What's up?
That's great, the class
of Pérez Carranza...
forming future architects.
He's Leonardo,
the current owner of the house.
Kids, trust your instincts
more than these guys, okay?
lt's the only house Le Corbusier
made in America.
lt's the only house Le Corbusier
made in America.
comfort, harmony...
comfort, harmony...
-''Mate'' tea?
-Yes, Madam.
Thank you very much, Madam.
-Hi.
-Hi, Elba.
-Hello, Sir.
-Any news?
Okay, l'll get to the studio,
send a few emails...
and talk to the guy next door.
Okay, go on.
-Hey!
-Going down!
Hey!
Careful, dumbass!
Hello?
Hey!
ls the owner there?
Oh, hello.
Listen, you can't make this hole.
l spoke to your men yesterday.
lt directly faces my house.
That's illegal, it's prohibited.
Let's start over. Good afternoon.
l'm Víctor.
To whom do l owe the pleasure?
Leonardo, l live here.
Oh, Leonardo, I was going
to tell you yesterday,
but I couldn't stop by.
Well, the thing is that
l don't have light on this side,
the sun shines on the other side
and l need to catch some rays.
That's all. That's why l'm making
these changes.
But now that you're here,
l'll ask your permission.
Can l do it? Why don't you
come over and l'll explain?
No, no.... l'm working right now.
l don't understand.
You can't make a window
on the dividing wall...
facing my house.
Well, l don't think
the neighborhood got that news.
How about the buildings over there?
-What?
-That one, and the other one.
No, that's totally different.
Yours is illegal.
You're invading my privacy
and my family's.
But if they can see you
from all those windows,
l'm trying to catch some rays...
l'm trying to catch some rays...
Yes, but tell me your name again,
please.
-Víctor.
-And last name, please.
Víctor Chubello.
Lola, go to the kitchen
with Mom.
Let me touch base with you, Víctor.
You know what it's like...
when you have a family,
my wife doesn't like people...
Plus, there's my daughter.
Plus, there's my daughter.
Okay, but l'm not a psychopath.
l won't be spying to see...
what you're doing at your house,
and l don't suppose...
you'll be spying on me either.
We're working people,
good people.
Plus, if l see some panties
on the line, l don't mind.
Right, okay. Look,
l'm not talking about you, really.
lmagine if you leave one day,
you rent or sell the house,
and we don't know your tenant,
but Te gets a window into my home.
and l swear, l'll die here.
and l swear, l'll die here.
about whether you could do this?
about whether you could do this?
-Let's not get all legalist about it.
-No, l...
Why don't you come over
and we'll talk about it?
l'm right around the corner.
Street 54, Number 320,
down the hall. Come over,
we'll have some mate tea...
and talk about it as neighbors.
Look, l'm sorry.
l'm really busy with work now.
l really can't. But please,
cover the hole, leave everything...
the way it was before,
and next week, if you like,
we'll drink some mate tea
and talk about it calmly.
-Leandro...
-Leonardo.
l see, l see, but no...
this isn't going to work.
l see, l see, but no...
this isn't going to work.
You can't, you can't do this.
I'm asking you, please,
understand my point of view now.
Okay. l'll tell the men
to cover the hole...
Okay, please do.
Okay, please do.
He'll paint too, right?
Mm-mm. But l had
to raise my voice.
l heard.
What do you expect?
lf he's going to be crazy, l'll be crazier.
He has to leave it the way
it was before.
Yes, yes. I told him so.
Poor guy, he seemed
to have gotten scared.
Give me a peck.
lt's a ''design'' chicken.
You'll see.
l'm testing my little camera.
-Want some more, Betty?
-Yes.
lt says ''demo''.
We're filming Ana now,
my beautiful daughter.
-How are you, Ana?
-Hi, Dad.
We zoom in and see Betty
close up. Smile, Betty.
-Hi.
-Tell us how you liked Rome.
Lovely, a spectacular trip,
we toured around...
-Oh!
-Not a lot of money though.
lt says ''solarize''.
What could that mean?
We only spent on the camera.
Now it says ''fade'' and it
gets dark, can't see anything.
Now the image is back.
-Did you make any stops?
-Yes, but it wasn't bad.
Oh, ''vertical flip''!
Can you call Lola
so l can film her?
Lola! Lola,
your grandparents are there.
Lolex!
lt says ''replicate''.
Loli!
Lola!
''Super lithium battery''.
He did something really weird.
No, it's so it won't get dirty.
I think l asked him to.
Hey, they're breaking the wall.
Yeah. What can l do?
They're repairing. What else?
- Why don't you check, anyway?
- No. No way.
l can't get involved
in another guy's life.
He can do whatever
he likes in his own house.
No, he isn't breaking the wall.
He's working inside.
Okay?
Okay, l'm going to work.
Nobody dropped by?
Is Lola back from school?
Nobody came by.
Lola is home now.
The Missis is teaching upstairs.
Okay. I'll be a little late.
Please lock the garage, the backyard.
Lock everything, okay?
Yes, sir.
Oh, Elba, when you have a moment,
remember what I asked  you for.
If you could please clean a bit
next to the hollow,
where the marble and mirror meet,
it's a little dirty,
some black specks
that won't come out.
All right, sir.
Can I talk to Lola a bit?
Lola, sweetie, your dad
wants to talk to you.
Come.
She doesn't want to talk to you,
she's playing the guitar.
Okay, send her my love.
Let's try to make
our minds go blank,
control breathing.
lnhale in five, four, three...
Exhale slowly.
Let's see, we'll change this.
Better use this.
Good.
Let's try to make
our minds go blank.
Open your eyes.
Forget what this object is.
Analyze its shape.
We identify the palette
of silver, grey, chrome.
Breathe slower each time.
Damn. Sorry, girls,
but we can't work with this racket.
Leonardo, sorry to bother you,
but l can't work...
with the neighbor's noise.
lt's all a mess.
l had to suspend the class.
It may be his house,
but he can't do that.
You're calling me a cop?
lt looks complicated.
There's no gate.
There's an easy access
from the sidewalk...
and neighboring plots.
Glass windows.
You have to add bars.
No, no. We aren't adding bars.
That's why we were...
interested in asking
about an alarm,
especially for when
there's nobody home.
Or a panic button.
Where does the panic button go?
Where would you put it?
-Here?
-Yes.
l'd have to ask Le Corbusier.
Right. You may know
that what crooks usually do...
is to lock up their victims
so they can work in peace.
Usually in the bathroom.
l would put a panic button...
under the sink in each
bathroom on the property.
Leonardo.!
Leonardo.!
Leonardo.!
Do you have a sec?
l want to talk about the remodeling.
Oh, right. Tell me.
No, not here. Let's go to a bar
and talk as friends.
The thing is,
l'm working now.
You've been dozing off
at the computer for half an hour.
Give it a rest, Leonardo,
come on down.
That bar is full of rednecks.
Come on down.
That bar is full of rednecks.
Come on down.
Right, uh...
l'm kind of busy, really.
How about telIing me from there?
Leonardo,
can you get down here?
Okay, hold on a sec.
How are you?
Look, I have to get back soon.
Tell me, what's up?
Look, I have to get back soon.
Tell me, what's up?
No, let's not talk here,
it's uncomfortable.
How about going in the van,
l'll turn on the AC...
and we can chat there.
-Wow, it's another world in here.
-Come in.
Excuse me.
See? There's a 12 volt cable
attached to it...
to keep the water hot.
Right. Okay. Go ahead,
tell me, l only have a minute.
Right. Okay. Go ahead,
tell me, l only have a minute.
Okay, look, Leonardo.
l like and respect you...
as a neighbor and as a person.
But the window is going
to be done no matter what,
otherwise, the remodeling l've been
making for three months...
will look awful, everything
will be dark.
And all the money l spent
will have been a huge waste.
But l don't want to screw you over.
the modern style
of your house.
the modern style
of your house.
l thought of a porthole,
like in ships.
But no, l'm going to make
a rectangular window.
Don't worry, Leonardo.
lt'll be the coolest,
the prettiest window in your house.
Okay, l appreciate the idea,
but we can't do this, Víctor.
Aside from everything
we discussed,
and the fact it isn't legal,
the other real problem here...
is my wife.
She's really obsessive.
lnflexible.
I don't realIy care that much,
it's not such a big deal to me.
But she'll never accept it.
We can add some plant pots there.
Don't you know
women love plants?
-No, what plants?
-Have some mate tea.
Damn, that burnt me!
lt's terrible!
Sorry.
ls she home now?
We'll go over and explain.
No. lt'll just be worse.
Plus, she isn't home.
Then give me her number.
l'll call her.
l'm irresistible to women.
Wait, Víctor,
how could you just call my wife?
That can't work.
Leonardo, l'm not
a psychopath,
and l'm being as pleasant
as l can about this.
What's her name?
My wife?
Ana.
l'll call her.
l'll convince her.
No, wait, let me talk
to her again and see...
if I can explain
what you want to do.
l can't promise anything.
I'd anticipate a ''no''.
Okay. Zoom.
Zoom into the glasses.
Zoom, zoom.
Can you look at the camera, please?
Zoom, zoom.
Can you look at the camera, please?
-Ready? Okay
.-Focus.
-Okay.
-Focus.
Deborah, we have to have him
on the left of the frame.
Right.
Something easy,
and in the edition,
we'll add all the inserts,
do something a little crazier.
-With the chair and all that.
-Perfect.
-Okay?
-Perfect.
-Good?
-Yes, good.
-Okay.
-Ready? Can l start?
Yes.
Sorry about all this, Leonardo.
We want it to come out better.
So, tell us a bit about
the Kachanovsky chair,
it's been sold all around
the world.
How did the creative process
come up?
How did the creative process
come up?
Well, it's funny that you
should ask me that now...
Sorry, l forgot one thing.
I'll need you to repeat...
the questioning your reply.
Because my question
won't be heard.
lt will be edited out.
So l'd need you to do that...
so we can understand you, okay?
Thanks.
-Okay.
-Very kind of you.
We've been presenting
some designs...
at the Milan Biennial.
Wait, wait, some
hammering sounds are coming out.
Yeah.
All right, we'll go on.
lt's okay, we'll continue.
You've earned yourself a place
as a successful designer.
What would you tell
young people who are starting out?
lt's a question l don't think
is appropriate, because...
lt's just that they suggested
l ask you that question.
Okay, how about asking me
about the Milan Biennial,
-And it went great.
-Okay.
-And it went great.
-Okay.
You don't want to
say anything about...
No.
Okay. We know you've been
very successful...
at the Milan Biennial,
one of the most important...
in the world.
-Yes.
-Can you tell us a bit about it?
Well, it was a very good
reception for us...
You know what? Don't forget
to mention the question.
Otherwise, people won't
understand.
For example:
We've been very successful...
in our presentations,
excellent sales,
a large audience, et cetera,
at the Milano Biennial.
We've been very successful
in our presentations,
excellent sales,
a large audience, etcetera,
with our designs
at the Milano Biennial.
l respect you a great deal,
l told you so...
when I asked you
about the interview.
-But we're working.
-Right.
We have been as respectful
as possible.
-Look, that's fantastic...
-We think we deserve the same.
l'd say that out of respect
for you and the others,
and for my time as well,
we should end this interview.
I think this attitude
is authoritarian, to say the least.
-On your part.
-Okay. Okay.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you very much.
-Should l remove the microphone?
-Yes.
Yes. One moment.
Mr. Leonardo?
-Mr. Leonardo?
-Going.
lt's for you.
-Who is it?
-The neighbor.
Tell him l'm busy and that
l asked not to be disturbed.
Hello? Mr. Leonardo is too busy,
and he asked not to be disturbed.
He says to cut it off,
because you're not doing squat.
That the TV people are gone.
-What?
-That's what he said, sir.
Hello?
He says he's inviting you
for a snack...
at a really cool bar,
and not to be a jerk.
What do l say?
Turn it off
Elba!
Elba!
Elba!
Sir?
Good morning.
Can you please make breakfast, Elba?
Right away, sir.
Víctor.
Víctor!
Víctor!
Hello.
Sorry, were you sleeping?
No, l wasn't sleeping,
Leonardo. Tell me.
Okay, this is the thing.
We lost the battle.
lt's as l said.
She won't hear of it.
Let me talk to her.
No, no, it'll be worse.
l know her.
When she says no,
she means no.
Look, I was thinking,
about the money...
you spent on the repairs,
plus the money...
you'll have to spend
on the wall,
so that we can speed
things up a bit, okay?
so that we can speed
things up a bit, okay?
l was thinking that 15 thousand
would be okay...
for the general costs
and we can leave it at that?
Or... is 15 okay?
Maybe it's not enough.
Leonardo, my boy.
What are you proposing?
Leonardo, my boy.
What are you proposing?
-Do you want to bribe me?
-No... no.
Yes, you want to bribe me.
No, not at all,
l want to help you.
You have expenses
to cover...
Look, I don't want 15, or 20,
or even a million.
l just need some of the sun
that you have so much of.
Yes, but we can't...
Yes, but we can't...
Let me finish the idea,
Leonardo.
l need some of the sun
that you don't use.
Think of it that way.
is ruining your life,
then just forget about it.
is ruining your life,
then just forget about it.
l prefer to give up,
so we can still be friends.
That's it. I'd forget
about the window,
l won't bother you anymore.
lt's over.
No more worries.
Wait for me,
l'll be right there.
Take this.
Open it. I put a fork in.
Open it.
Open it. I put a fork in.
Open it.
Oh, a preserve.
What is it?
Marinated boar.
My own production.
-I hunted it myself.
-lmagine that.
You wouldn't imagine
how it squealed.
lt was hellish.
lt's as home made as it fucking comes,
you know.
I added ten ears
of chopped garlic.
Tasty.
Tasty? You haven't tried it.
Stick the fork in, Leonardo.
Try it.
-What are those flowers for, Elba?
-They're for the Missis.
What?
A bouquet of roses
for the prettiest neighbor.
With all my love and respect,
your neighbor, Víctor.
-Give them to me.
-But...
Give them to me.
my house, my living room,
everything.
my house, my living room,
everything.
I stopped him.
Stopped him right there,
I stopped him.
Stopped him right there,
l said it was prohibited,
l scared him a little.
Unbelievable.
Yes. But l have to say,
he's a determined tacky guy.
Overbearing and really insistent.
Listen to this.
The other day, he rang the doorbell.
Elba, the maid, answered.
l said l was busy, whatever.
Do you know what he said?
''Tell Tim to cut it out,
he's not doing squat,
the TV people are gone.''
l mean, the guy was spying.
He saw the channel people leave.
Terrible. It was a nightmare.
Then he told the maid,
''Tell him l'm inviting...
him out for a snack,
to not be a jerk.''
Tell me he's not a genius.
And then what?
Well, l had no choice.
I had to go.
l got into Zen mode.
Took it...
as an anthropological exercise.
l went down and he was waiting
for me in a van...
with tainted glass windows,
and a disco ball.
That lovely car deodorant smell.
So he starts the car,
we stop at a stop light.
A windshield wiper comes along.
-Do you know what he does?
-No.
You know what he did?
You know it makes you tense,
because those people
can be aggressive.
Yeah, they scare me.
No. No, sir.
The guy rolls down the window.
He pats his ass,
l swear,
and l don't know what he whispers
into his ear, laughs,
and he leaves, happy as ever.
Then, we got to the ''cool'' bar.
As he called it.
He parked the van,
and a ''guard boy'' comes along.
He's like, ''Hey, boss,
I'll watch your car.''
This guy can neutralize
any weird situation...
with his crazy logic.
He says in this deep voice,
but really cool,
he says, ''Don't watch it,
take care of it,
that's not the same thing.''
Which bar did he take you to?
A disgusting bar
down Centennial Road.
-But he took you really far.
-Yeah.
You never told me that.
It's crazy.
What he did was so trashy.
See?
You're crazy.
l would have called the cops.
Oh, that's really nice.
No way would l call the cops.
Who do you think I am?
l still don't understand
what the guy does, l didn't get it.
He sells used cars, l don't know,
he's a troglodyte.
There, hear that?
That dirty texture.
-See?
-So strong.
-See?
-So strong.
Now that's too much,
and l'm a fan.
No, l like it when it goes too far,
l love it. lt makes me a fan.
Okay.
Where's he from?
He's Canadian,
but he lives in Düsseldorf.
l saw him at Ambers.
l saw him at Ambers.
Google him later,
you'll love him.
l love those sounds,
the random thumping.
lt's from the sub-woofer, right?
That one.
Oh, no.
lt's the guy next door again.
-Hey.
-What?
This Julián is an idiot, huh?
He was always dumb.
She's a little air headed too,
isn't she?
Yes, but less than him.
Just like him.
l saw Elba wearing
an old shirt of mine...
Yes, it was worn out.
Yes, it was worn out.
Exactly.
That's what l think is wrong.
She took a green cup
with her the other day,
because there was only one left.
Then buy her a new set
of six green cups.
This, you get rid of this today.
Cover it with bricks,
plaster it, do it all today!
ls that clear?
Are you all crazy, or stupid?
Listen, tell Víctor,
wherever the hell he is,
that this has to be
covered today.
Get this horrible thing out
of here, this piece of junk.
Please, my patience has run out,
This is the end of it, okay?
Do you understand
what I'm saying?
Do you understand the gravity
of what l'm saying?
The lack of respect?
The invasiveness of the that...
you're creating here?
Tell him it's his last chance.
lt's over.
No more fucking around,
no more clowning around.
Please!
This can't be done!
lt can't be done!
Understand?
lt can't be done in Japan,
in China, or wherever the fuck!
l'll go to the police,
get a lawyer,
l'll go to the police,
get a lawyer,
and everyone goes to jail.
Everyone in jail.
This is over.
It's over today.
Tell him this word for word.
Tell Víctor everything.
Spell it out.
My God.
Everything okay, Lola?
There's food downstairs,
there's a lot to eat.
Do you want a bruschetta?
You put the little robots there,
the ones we bought in New York,
at the MOMA.
l can't make it,
l just can't concentrate.
l don't know, l don't know.
What do you think?
No, how could you...?
What? No, l don't want
the French to be offended.
lt has to be an excellent lie.
Not just that. Not only
should they not be offended,
they should totally agree
with the reason for the delay.
l don't know, let's think
about it.
No, they won't believe that.
No. No, but... no.
For example, you can tell them...
the job was done
but I didn't think...
it was excellent enough,
so l decided to keep refining...
covering the costs, et cetera.
Understand?
covering the costs, et cetera.
Understand?
Right. Okay, let's do that.
Keep me posted.
No. No. I don't know.
l have to sleep,
l haven't slept in a week.
Okay. Good.
Okay. Okay, bye.
Okay.Okay, bye.
-No.
-Why not?
-No.
-Why not?
We don't need that.
l don't want a lawyer invoIved.
l already made it clear.
Look, if this isn't fixed tomorrow,
l'll beat the crap out of him.
Everything has a limit.
Are you crazy?
What are you saying?
Listen to yourself.
You sound like a caveman.
Whatever you want.
But if he catches me...
on a bad day, l'll punch
the daylights out of Tim,
and bye-bye conflict.
Did you order ice-cream
or something?
Sorry about the time, boss.
Leonardo, l've been thinking
about the window, and...
you're right.
l'm sorry.
Sometimes l get an idea,
l get obsessed,
and l can't help it.
He was your uncle?
Yes, I was explaining...
He was your uncle?
Yes, I was explaining...
how they had to do it.
Okay, the window issue is cleared up.
Okay.
But under no circumstances
will l allow you...
to raise your voice
at my uncle Carlos.
Wait, wait.
l don't know what he told you.
Didn't you realize my uncle Carlos
isn't like us?
Didn't you realize
he's mentally retarded?
You can tell me whatever you want.
l'll chew his nuts off.
l'll chew his nuts off.
Wherever he is,
whoever he is.
You know what l don't get?
What's the point in mistreating
a differently-abled person?
-Where's the fun in it?
-No...
The window thing is cleared up.
But now, Leonardo...
you're going to apologize to me.
Okay. Okay, you're right.
l'm listening.
Okay. l apologize.
l'm sorry.
lf you fuck with my uncle Carlos
again,
l swear l'll kill you,
you chickenshit son of a bitch.
Kidding.
l was kidding, relax, boy.
Relax, brother.
Oh, l'm running late.
Hey. Are you asleep?
Sort of.
Why the flashlight?
The neighbor is with someone.
Do you hear that?
Come on!
Come on!
Come on, let's go see
what that demented guy is up to.
How refined.
What's he doing?
l can't believe it.
My God, it's crazy.
He's leaving,
he's leaving her alone.
Son of a bitch.
No, no...
What an animal.
lt's grotesque.
As an architect,
I can tell you that the guy
can't make a window there.
Especially not in this house.
Well, apparently, he can,
because he did,
we can see that, but he can't
do it without your consent.
But he presses me
about needing sun.
Sun? Then he can make a window
up there, a thin one,
20 centimeters high,
with frosted glass.
He can add some bars to it.
And no ventilation.
That's what the code says.
lt would be horrible,
it would still ruin my house.
Don't worry, you'll always have
the last word.
ln a dividing wall,
each gets 15 centimeters.
You can do anything you like
with your 15 centimeters.
You can build a brick waIl,
you can cover that window.
But l don't recommend it,
because it'll turn him against you.
Those things are always
solved by talking them out.
But the rule exists.
he's doing something illegal.
Well, codes are one thing,
real life is another.
Domestic problems often,
or very often end badly.
Does the guy
have a problem with you?
He sent my wife flowers.
Okay. Just talk to him.
All there is to it.
-This armchair is great.
-lt is, isn't it?
Yes.
lt's comfortable.
lt has a lot of position options.
so it doesn't have a single
support point,
so it doesn't have a single
support point,
which makes it rock
in different directions.
l see, it's like floating.
Yes, well that's sort
of the idea,
but the movement
is very organic.
Don't worry, you won't fall off.
It has a counterweight...
that stabilizes it at the base.
lt's great. l saw it at a store,
but they're pretty costly.
You just have to tell me
what color you like.
You just have to tell me
what color you like.
lt comes in black and brown leather,
in cow hide,
but the classic, standard one
is this one, the black one.
Well, what a luxury.
Thanks.
-Good morning.
-Hello.
Come in. How are you?
Good?
Sir?
-Yes?
-Can I come in?
Under no circumstances, Madam,
this is my house.
l read on the internet
that it was possible.
What do l know?l live here,
it's private property,what can I say?
l'm already here.
Listen to me, sorry,
but if l ring your doorbelI...
and ask you if l can
open your refrigerator,
rummage in your drawers
and use your bathroom,
you'd say l'm out of place,
wouldn't you?
Okay. I don't know, Wikipedia
causes psychological damage.
Come in.
Come upstairs, kids, please.
Come upstairs, kids, please.
Okay. lt seems to have
a very significant...
structural disproportion.
You can tell, see?
A little.
Can you?
Yes, right?
lt's as if you could place
a war tank on the chair,
if you wanted to,
or needed to...
Okay, we'll set the structural issue
aside for a while.
You sit down and rest your back
on this thing,
You sit down and rest your back
on this thing,
lt's lovely, but you'll get
a lot of lawsuits...
lt's lovely, but you'll get
a lot of lawsuits...
from paralytics.
How do l get on it?
Do l hop?
How do l get on it?
Do l hop?
-No. l don't know.
-It isn't practical, is it?
Not ergonomic at all.
Just study dentistry?
Just study dentistry?
No. No, it's good, it's great.
lt's good, isn't it?
lt's great, l mean it.
Especially if you set aside...
idea, concept, structure,
ergonomics, stability...
and other minor details that we have
no reason to study at university.
Please take it.
Look at that.
What is it?
-What?
-A model. The model.
No, l'm serious, I don't know.
I don't know if it's a chair,
a chaise longue,
a deckchair, a chocolate bar...
Okay, it's like a deckchair,
an interior chaise longue.
lf you don't really know
what type of object it is,
l can't help you very much.
Let me see, let me guess.
lnspired in Mies Van de Rohe.
-I love Mies.
-You do? How about you?
-I love Mies.
-You do? How about you?
-You know who it is, right?
-Sure.
Kids. Mies worked
over80 years ago.
l can't believe that today,
in 2010, the proposal...
is the same, but much worse.
Although as a kinesiologist's bed,
this is awesome.
Great.
Sorry l made you come
to my house,
but l'm not going to university
these days.
Listen, l told you about
the weak points.
l think the good things
are obvious, and you know it.
You don't have to take
everything l say as truth,
there could be things
l don't see...
due to my own
professional training,
or because l have
a defined style.
But new and good ideas
are just a step away...
from being ridiculous, right?
Víctor.
Víctor.
Víctor!
Víctor!
Víctor!
Oh, sorry, I was...
were you calling a long time?
No, just a couple of times.
Let's do this: l'll give you
my number,
so you can call me.
For anything you need.
Do you have a pen and paper?
Yes.
-Tell me.
-482-1717.
-Okay.
-Give me yours.
What are you looking at?
l won't be calling all the time.
-482...
-3443.
-482...
-3443.
There we go, l got it down.
l'm making a lot of noise, aren't I?
You'll thank me for it.
No, it's okay,
no problem with the noise.
Listen, Víctor, it's been a week
and the window is still here.
You didn't cover it.
Remember we agreed to that?
Well, it's just with all these
comings and goings,
the boys got a gig
at the coast...
and they had to go there.
But l spoke to them on the phone,
and they said...
they'd be here on Monday, for sure.
So don't worry.
l promised you, l'll do it.
l'm asking you to please
do it on Monday,
l'm being a good sport
about this.
l swear on my fucking
dead mother,
we'll do it on Monday.
Hello?
Hey, you do design, art,
all that stuff, right?
Yes, yes, things like that.
Come out, l'm at your door.
Do you like them?
They're good,
very good.
Yeah, l work
with old rifles,
pipes, bullets.
Which do you like best?
l don't know, they're...
Both are powerful.
Very personal, they're great.
Which do you like best?
-This one.
-It's the ''Origin''.
lt's a uterus, a vagina.
lt's a uterus, a vagina.
lt's a pussy made
out of 9 mm bullets...
and barbed wire.
This one is ''Techno-Tango''
lt's more futuristic.
You know, Leonardo,
l think that robots...
will end up listening
to Tango.
You don't say.
Look at that.
Leonardo, you can have it.
but l can't accept this, no.
but l can't accept this, no.
Yes, but it's too much.
There's no need, no, Víctor.
Yes, but it's too much.
There's no need, no, Víctor.
Okay, if you don't accept it,
l'll be offended.
Don't be that way.
l know you're a genius
in the arts, and, well...
That's it.
I'm leaving it here.
lf you don't want it,
just throw it away.
l made it for you,
because you're my neighbor.
Víctor Chubello, 482-1717.
1717 VíctorChubello
Good, I got it.
I don't need an address.
These things can be resolved...
without getting into lawsuits
or mediations.
We just have to scare him
real good, and that's it.
These guys only understand
things that way.
Okay, but where do we
take it from here?
Don't worry about it.
Don'tworryabout it.
I'll have him on hold
for ten minutes...
I'll have him on hold
for ten minutes...
and he'll be soft by then.
Then I'll tell him
he could lose his house,
that he's in some big trouble,
and all that.
He'll get really scared.
It's the only way he'll understand.
Okay, well, let me know
your fees,
so l can send them to you.
No, no, no way.
Please.
The things is that the woman
went to Estévez before I did.
So when she talked to him,
he knew it was all messed up.
lt was scandalous,
but too bad for her.
l'm not up for
this mediocre nonsense.
l said from the beginning
that l wouldn't give...
Not only that, l also think
it's an obvious way...
Not only that, l also think
it's an obvious way...
to get more money
and spend less.
l said she could either
change her attitude,
l can't let two fatsos
ruin things for me.
l can't let two fatsos
ruin things for me.
What do you think?
Yes. Yes, you're right.
Yes, I need to stop these women.
Give me a peck.
Ana, I'm trying to concentrate.
Why don't you go to hell?
ldiot.
You can't work because of me?
Leonardo, it's Quique.
Can you come out? l'm at the door.
-Do you want to come in?
-No, I'll miss my flight.
-I brought the three checks.
-Thanks.
Tomorrow, l'm meeting
with the Chinese investors...
in Milan.
Right.
That's logical.
That's logical.
The delivery should
have been made last week.
The delivery should
have been made last week.
No, it'll be done.
Everything will be up-to-date.
No, it'll be done.
Everything will be up-to-date.
l've just had some problems.
-What kind?
-Conjugal...
-Really?
-Ana's unbearable.
She's being very silly,
l haven't screwed in a month,
but it'll be over soon.
So that's the problem?
lt's been a month...
l don't know if you realize,
if you do it on purpose,
if you're just distracted,
but every time l can finally...
ignore the noise
from next door,
you come and ask for a peck,
it's absurd.
I don't know
l've been thinking about it.
I don't know
l've been thinking about it.
''Gimme a peck'', why does it
bother me? What's the reason?
l can't believe it.
l'm in peace here,
you ask me for a peck,
and force me to drop...
everything l'm doing
so I'll kiss you,
that could mean
for the past few days.
that could mean
for the past few days.
-What do you think it means?
-Are you serious?
You don't know, then?
It's a mechanism,
you want to transfer...
your distress to me,
your badly channeled anxiety,
and you unload that on me.
l get tense,
it snowballs,
and it never ends. That's what.
Don't get it.
lt could be Tim.
l'm expecting a call.
Hello?
Oh, yes, how are you?
Yes, yes.
At four, as always.
Yes, okay. See you.
Kisses.
What is that?
Oh, it's a sculpture.
Oh, it's a sculpture.
he thinks he's an artist,
he's so annoying.
he thinks he's an artist,
he's so annoying.
l don't suppose you'll leave
that piece of shit at home.
lt's so ugly that it's
actually pretty.
But, no, of course.
l'll throw it away.
Yes, throw it away.
-Don't bother me, l'm reading.
-Have it your way.
What are you doing, idiot?
Let go.
Fucking brute,
you'll wake Lola!
-Let go of the blanket!
-You let go, crazy fucker!
So, what do I want to say with this?
l don't think it's wrong
for you to hate your parents
For you to hate me.
lf it's genuine, that's fine.
But ask yourself
if it's something real,
or just an excuse to not confront
what really bothers you.
Maybe just because I'm here,
you make me responsible...
for something
l don't even know about.
Maybe not.
Maybe you have your reasons,
l'll even support you.
But think about it.
l'll even support you.
But think about it.
Ask yourself
whether it's right.
Look around you.
Look around.
And before you say,
''Dad's this, Dad's that,''
look at yourself a bit,
measure yourself...
against the same standards...
and if you still think
l deserve all your condemnation,
okay, l'll accept that.
Okay, Lolex?
But this is light, Mario.
Go ahead, I'll take the bags.
But this is light, Mario.
Go ahead, I'll take the bags.
l'm going to charge you
a commission later.
l'll take the two a few days,
give you some peace a while.
Yes. I'll give you a few bucks
later on,
but don't say anything.
Okay, have a good time, behave.
Lolex, seat belt.
See? This tree joins
all the plants.
This tree was here before.
No, no, it was part of the project,
Le Corbusier planned it.
Here he proposed a parasol,
a bris-soleil...
that blocks direct sunlight.
ln some way, it marks
the landscape...
so you can have a more human scale.
Let me show you the bedrooms.
ls this yours?
Pretty. Small.
2.26. All the measurements
are based on the ModuIor.
2.26. All the measurements
are based on the ModuIor.
lt's a system invented
by Le Corbusier,
with the human scale in mind.
Should we go to the study?
Good, good, nice chair.
lt's cute.
But, entre nous...
it doesn't seem too comfortable.
-You're mean!
-Very mean.
But okay, it's a start.
We can see about it.
We can figure it out.
Okay, next time,
l want to see...
For example,
how you'd join...
That's it, we'll see.
Very good.
That's it, we'll see.
Very good.
-Okay.
-Very good.
Julia, l'm alone here
for a few days.
Stay. l'll make something
good to eat, some pasta.
You can stay.
-What are you saying?
-What am l saying? What you heard.
-What are you saying?
-What am l saying? What you heard.
What's wrong with the proposal?
You beat the routine a bit,
we can sleep together,
have a good time,
don't be silly.
What are you saying?
lt's all good,
but who do you think I am?
l don't think anything
bad about you,
What's wrong with being
straightforward...
What's wrong with being
straightforward...
and telling you
what's on my mind?
ls it wrong to invite
a pretty girl to fuck,
to have fun, have a good time?
ls there a protocol?
What are the rules?
You're being schematic.
You're a fool
and you're out of place.
Julia, Julia.
l can tell. You don't really
like what you do,
you're bored of your boyfriend,
he's a handsome guy,
but he's a little dumb, isn't he?
l can tell you're a bit
uncomfortable with things,
and that you're dying
to fuck me.
But you want me to put up
with some silly game first.
You're crazy, it's not that at all.
None of that is happening to me.
That's it, the end.
I'm sure it's the most
interesting proposal...
you ever got in your life.
Really? You don't say.
Leonardo.!
-Can you open the door?
-Yes.
l'm fucking a bon-bon
like that too.
She got off the bus here
around the corner,
and one day, l just got her
into my van,
and the romance began.
Her name is Fabiana.
The little whore is 24.
This has nothing
to do with that.
She was just a student.
What do you want, Víctor?
What's the matter?
What do you want, Víctor?
What's the matter?
What? You're in a hurry,
can't talk, and whatever, right?
-Leonardo, what did you do to me?
-What did l do with that?
You sent a crow, boy.
Oh, right, no, it's just that...
This lawyer calls me, right?
All bossy,
saying that if I didn't do
this or that,
bad stuff would happen to me,
or whatever.
No.
So l looked up the address
of the firm,
l went over,
rang the bell,
stayed in the waiting room.
Nobody called me,
so I entered the office.
You know what that old man
looked like?
As white as a sheet,
he almost pissed his pants.
And it was all just this.
Near the end, though,
l grabbed his ears a bit.
Listen, Leonardo,
how are you going...
to send a lawyer over?
We're in La Plata, Buenos Aires.
Wait, wait, l don't know
what the lawyer told you.
Let's put a stop to this.
Start out on a clean slate.
Let's go to your house.
l just had an idea.
You can make it high, right?
A thin window,
above the head.
Two meters above ground,
for example.
Just a thin slit,
and a fixed glass window...
that should be, um...
of frosted glass,
so we won't see each other.
You'd have a window,
you'd have light,
sunlight, everything you need,
and legally, the way it is now,
the window doesn't work,
but what l'm thinking now...
is the only possible alternative,
and it's to my detriment, right?
You lift it up to here,
leave a thin window higher up,
without this frame,
without this wooden thing,
and a fixed frosted glass,
or glass bricks,
they come in twenties.
You know what, Leonardo?
l'll buy that.
Turn the music down, dummy.
Right, right,
call me as soon as you send it,
so l can take a quick look,
I'll catch up,
and l'll be back at the study
on Monday.
We'll look at it together.
You think?
Okay. You too.
l can't believe it.
What did he do?
Wasn't Te going
to cover it up?
He left a thinner window.
Well, it's not over...
What's not over, idiot?
Will he move in next?
lt's not finished,
a frosted glass goes there.
lt's built above anuyone's head.
You'd have to stand...
on a stool to see anything.
lt's impossible.
l can't believe you allow all this.
lt's a fixed glass.
l can't believe you don't care
that that weirdo...
can look at your wife,
your daughter...
and control your life
through that hole.
and control your life
through that hole.
Or l'll buy cement and cover it myself.
Or l'll buy cement and cover it myself.
Hello. Víctor?
How are you?
Leonardo, your neighbor.
Listen. l have to give you
some very bad news.
My father-in-law came over
on the weekend,
he saw the window
and there was a huge fight.
No, my father-in-law... no.
l didn't mean...
he paid most of it.
he paid most of it.
My father-in-law...
No, he's terrible, he has a temper.
He's very tough... huh?
No, he says he won't accept...
any remodeling,
he says it devalues the property.
No, just halt it.
Don't put in the glass,
you'll just waste money,
he'll get rid of it all,
l know him,
when he wants something...
that we were buddies,
that we had talked about it,
that we were buddies,
that we had talked about it,
but he doesn't want
to hear it.
No, he's a mean guy,
you know what he says?
That since the property
isn't mine,
l don't care to look out for it,
and that if I don't want...
to care for the privacy
of my wife and daughter,
then he'll do it himself.
He's capable of...
Of course.
Let me tell you,
our only option...
for this to not get worse
is to... right.
and pray that he calms down.
and pray that he calms down.
Not next week, if you can
do it today, do it,
because we'll be in trouble.
ln big.... yes.
Yes, of course.
Of course, of course.
Right. Right.
Look, l'm sorry,
l have to go now,
l have a real mess here at work,
l have to go, l can't talk.
But please, try to speed it up,
because you know...
l did everything l could.
Bye, Víctor.
Big hug. Bye-bye.
Bye, Víctor.
Big hug. Bye-bye.
lt's over.
Cheese!
Did it come out?
Yes it did.
Yes. Confirmed for ten o'clock.
Remember to bring
boyfriends.
You're all invited
with your boyfriends.
Bring that madman.Yes.
l'm not nice, l'm nosey.
l want to meet him.
Hi, let me introduce you
to my boyfriend, Víctor.
She's Ana, my teacher,
the owner of the house.
Hi, how are you?
Excuse me.
How pretty, everything's white.
Excuse me.
Best blow job
on the North side of town.
Best blow job
on the North side of town.
-Hello.
-Hello.
-How are you?
-Good.
Hey, let me guess.
Where's my sculpture, Origin?
Thanks, man.
This is a dream come true.
Being here,
you opening your door to me.
Being friends.
l'm so happy.
Too bad your father-in-law
got mad, huh?
What can you do?
He's the owner, right?
But he'll get over it.
l'll make barbeque at home...
one day, and invite him over.
Hey, let's make a toast.
Come on, cheers.
Shut it off.
l said shut it off.
Come on, come on.
Calm down.
Put them in the bathroom.
Calm down.
Come on, come on, come on.
Hello?
The panic button went off.
You screwed up, boy.
You know what?
lt's your lucky day.
Get out of here.
Don't touch him.
Stay upstairs!
Ana, please, go, go.
Go upstairs.
Give me that, Elba,
l'll call the ambulance.
-Will he die?
-Come on, come on.
Go!
THE MAN NEXT DOOR
Marinated boar,
by Víctor Chubello.
You chop the boar up
and leave it in white wine,
a lot of chopped garlic
and laurel overnight.
The next day, fry it with diced carrots,
onions and black pepper,
Then, add a glass
of the marinade...
and a glass of white vinegar
and cook it a little while longer.
Oh, and a bit of lemon.
Finally, put it all in a jar
and put it in the fridge.
Bye, seeya.
