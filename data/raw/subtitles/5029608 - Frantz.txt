Lovely lady.
.
Excuse me.
.
Yes?
Do you know who left those flowers on the grave?
.
Which one?
.
On the grave of Frantz Hoffmeister.
.
Oh yeah.
.
He must be a stranger.
.
Where is he from?
.
A French piece.
.
He left flowers on his grave?
.
Yes, roses.
.
Do you know who it could be?
.
No.
Could be a French friend before the war.
.
.
don't say anything to Hans.
.
How is he?
.
He has not left his clinic.
.
It's been hard on him.
.
On all of us.
.
Does it still hurt?
.
It bothers me at night when I walk a lot.
.
.
You will be able to run around.
.
The French will not have your leg.
.
.
Thank you Doctor.
.
For months we haven't seen you in our meetings, Doctor.
.
.
I love Germany,
.
and I love my son more.
.
I understand.
.
But do we need to endure this defeat?
.
This humiliation?
.
You share our desire for a strong nation, powerful...
.
.
You are here for your leg,
.
Mr.Kreutz.
.
Continue the treatment for a week and you will be fine.
.
.
I forgot to ask you something, Doctor.
.
.
Yes?
It's about Anna.
.
Anna?
.
She has no family
.
and you love her like a father.
.
I know she was fiancée to your son,
.
.
but I would like to ask for her hand.
.
.
Does she love you?
.
She will love me.
.
Anna.
Yes?
Mr.Kreutz wants to talk to you.
.
With me?
.
Come in.
.
Good Morning.
.
Good morning, Anna.
.
Please sit down.
.
How's school going?
.
I have been suspended.
.
That's a shame.
.
I lost the urge.
.
We all have lost loved ones,
.
.
but you have to live on,
.
rebuild.
.
Yes.
.
That's what Frantz wrote to me in his last letter.
.
.
I know how you feel.
.
Then you wouldn't be here.
.
With me, you will have to Frantz.
.
I don't want to forget.
.
And your patients?
.
Seasonal cold.
.
It's spring.
.
Saturday night, would you like to go to the dance?
.
No.
.
They have new dresses in the city.
.
.
Who do you go to?
.
Mr.Kreutz.
.
He only wants good for you.
.
Who could that be?
.
A patient at this hour?
.
Come in, please
.
Your name?
.
Rivoire.
.
Adrien Rivoire.
Are you not from here?
.
No.
.
Where do you come from?
.
From Paris.
.
French?
.
Yes.
.
I'm sorry I cannot attend to you.
.
.
Doctor, I have to talk to you...
.
No.
Go away.
.
I'm not sick, I just want...
.
.
Shut up.
.
You French
.
murdered my son.
.
Now go away.
.
You are right, Doctor.
.
I was also a soldier
.
and I am also a murderer.
.
Hans?
Is he in Frantz's room?
.
Hans?
What did that Frenchman want?
.
Do you know?
.
No.
.
I saw him in the cemetery.
.
In the cemetery?
.
Yes, two days back, when I was visiting Frantz's grave.
.
.
That morning, he wept.
.
What did he tell you?
.
Nothing.
.
I refused to treat him.
.
But Hans,
.
he could've been a friend of Frantz's,
.
whom he met in Paris.
.
Tell me,
.
Is this person staying here?
.
Yes. Sorry, he is not.
.
Are you looking for someone, Anna?
.
Surely must be me.
.
No.
.
Please give it personally.
.
I will do so.
.
I'm sorry I bothered yesterday,
.
but could you come to the dance on Saturday?
.
Dr.Hoffmeister does not mind.
.
I have no heart to dance.
.
Goodbye, Mr.Kreutz.
.
Who is that letter for?
.
For the Frenchman.
.
Are you sure he'll come?
.
I hope so.
.
If Hans had not renounced him, it would not have been the case.
.
.
Is Hans going to the market?
.
I hope so.
.
My God! Is that him?
.
Welcome.
.
I am Frantz's mother.
.
Hello.
.
Hello.
And Anna, who is like our daughter,
.
was Frantz's fiancé.
.
Hello.
.
Hello.
I saw you in the cemetery.
.
The note at the hotel is mine.
.
May I...?
.
Your coat.
.
This is my husband.
.
You know him already.
.
Hello.
.
Please go inside.
.
Have a seat.
.
You must have so much to tell.
.
How old are you?
.
24 years.
.
Frantz would have turned 24 in February.
.
You speak German well.
.
More or less.
.
Did you know Frantz?
.
Yes.
.
In France?
.
Yes.
.
Was that during his last trip?
.
Excuse me.
.
We thank you for your concern
.
and for the flowers on his grave.
.
It affects us a lot
.
to speak with a friend
.
who knew him well
.
and remembers him.
.
And I'm not saying this because I'm his mother,
.
.
Anna as well.
.
Come fall we were to be married.
.
His favorite season.
.
There is a poem by Verlaine
.
In the autumn, which he taught me.
.
.
In French.
.
I understand
.
speaking here is hard.
.
It must be hard
.
to meet his family.
.
You ever think of him?
Yes.
And never forget?
How could I forget?
Excuse my husband.
.
He loved Frantz so much,
.
our only child.
.
He would rather died instead.
.
Me too.
.
Could you tell us
.
how you met?
Yes.
The first time?
.
And also the last time?
.
Yes.
How was he the last time you saw?
.
The last time?
.
The last time
.
I saw...
.
Was he happy?
.
Glucklich?
.
Happy.
Was it in Paris?
.
Before the war?
.
Yes.
.
It was in Paris. Yes.
.
I went looking for his hotel,
.
to go to the Louvre.
.
Between friends.
.
It was a beautiful day.
.
I was happy to see the paintings.
.
.
And I as well.
.
And...
.
we stopped in front of a Manet.
.
.
I remember...
.
I remember...he liked one in particular.
.
The painting
.
of a pale young man,
.
his head placed aback.
.
Tonight, it were as if Frantz had returned.
.
.
God bless you.
.
Thank you.
.
Thank you for this night.
.
You have done them good.
.
Not to Mr.Hoffmeister.
.
Yes.
.
It's good of you to have come.
.
I don't know.
.
Goodnight.
.
Good night, Adrien.
.
Here lies Frantz Hoffmeister 5/2/1895 - 15/9/1918
.
Under these flowers, there's nothing.
.
Nothing?
.
He was buried in France,
.
anonymously among other soldiers.
.
We know the date of his death.
.
.
Sometimes, I think he is not dead.
.
.
He will return.
.
I'm sure he hears us.
.
* The long sobs *
* The autumn violins *
* Hurt my heart with a monotonous languor *
* Completely flushed and pale *
* When the hour strikes *
* I remember *
* Past days *
* And I cry *
* And I go *
* With the bad wind *
* Which brings me here, there *
* Like a dead leaf *
You have a beautiful accent.
You think I spoke in French.
It was our secret language.
Frantz loved France so much.
But he never told me about you.
What was it between you two?
A woman?
No...
What then?
A...
A friendship, that's all.
I had forgotten all this.
Leaves rustling in the wind.
It's this sound I love in the spring.
Were you here often?
Yes.
It was here Frantz asked for my hand...
before leaving for the war.
And how did you two meet?
He never told you?
No.
It was in a bookstore when we were students.
He was looking for a book on French poems.
And I, a book of German poems.
He asked me who my favorite poet was.
I said, Ruckert.
He replied, Verlaine.
He must have told you...
she was jealous of his studies in France.
I would have liked him, but...
I'd rather be alone,
far away from home and his family.
He said he would return for our honeymoon.
I would discover Paris,
the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre,
The Great Boulevards...
It's hot!
Don't you want to go swimming?
I don't have my swim wear.
Doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter. Come on.
Get up.
Ah! This feels good!
You should take a dip.
It's just...I can't swim.
Oh, yeah?
That's easy. I'll show you.
Are these war wounds?
Yes.
Did you suffer a lot?
My only injury is Frantz.
He looks like him.
Don't you believe that?
.
Not physically,
.
but by their character.
.
Shy and tormented.
.
I'm glad you're here.
.
Do you have brothers and sisters?
.
No.
.
I would have loved to have a brother.
.
And your parents?
.
My father died when I was a child.
.
.
My mother took over the farm after his death,
.
.
but with the war, it got complicated.
.
What did your father do?
.
Business.
.
Above all he was a musician.
.
He conveyed his passion.
.
I was in the conservatory
.
and I became a violinist in the Orchestre de Paris...
.
.
And now, after the war,
.
I don't play anymore.
.
You don't want to play anymore?
.
I no longer understand notes.
.
Often,
.
Frantz played the violin for us.
.
He was not a great musician,
.
but he played with all his heart.
.
His room,
.
just as he left it.
.
His books,
.
his folded clothes in the closet.
.
Frantz must have been happy here.
.
Yes.
.
But everything is broken.
.
I forced him
.
to enlist.
.
I sent him to battle.
.
It was his duty...
.
to serve his country.
.
Mine too, I was told.
.
This is
.
like the heart of my son.
.
Take it with you,
.
Frenchman.
.
No.
.
You could say, an old German gave it to you.
.
.
No...I cannot.
.
This is the last picture of Frantz.
.
The next day, he left for the front.
.
Frantz hated war.
.
He said often, the French were his brothers.
.
.
Magda...let it ago.
.
Read it aloud.
.
Dear Parents,
.
I would love to desert,
.
to be close to you,
.
away from this chaos.
.
This morning, we were in front of a soldier killed
.
.
and had open eyes.
.
.
We discovered a sea of ​​corpses.
.
.
French,
.
German,
.
how do I know?
.
In school, French children learn German
.
.
and Germans learn French.
.
And when they grow up, they kill. 
.
.
I have to go. Thanks for everything.
.
.
Before you leave,
.
a favor, I beg you.
.
Anna.
Play something for us.
.
Don't be afraid to make us happy. Hm?
.
.
Adrien!?
Are you okay?
Yes.
Must have been the chill in the lake.
Was Frantz a pacifist?
I do not know.
I regret that shocked you.
It's nothing, I was like him.
Are you better?
Yes.
Will I see you tomorrow?
Why, Anna? It doesn't make any sense.
Yes, you will do better.
And I as well.
So...how about we go to the dance tomorrow?
To the dance?
Yes.
I saw a poster. I...
I asked you...
Okay.
You look beautiful, Anna.
.
You look wonderful.
.
Really?
Yes.
.
.
And Frantz would like that.
.
It's absolutely lovely.
.
But, don't go saying,
.
it's a French designer
.
from Paris.
.
Thank you.
.
It's French.
.
What are you doing here?
.
This is not a good idea, Anna.
Don't worry.
I'm here.
Come.
Oh no, no. I...
.
Don't you know the Waltz?
No. Rather, yes. But no.
Come.
No.
Anna...
This going well?
Thank you.
Thank you.
You are welcome.
Do you want to dance with us?
.
Yes. Yes.
Well, you didn't have the heart to dance...
.
but you were convinced.
.
He's a friend of Frantz's.
.
Yes. A Frenchman.
.
So?
.
A Frenchman today,
.
in a German fest.
.
Don't you read the papers?
.
The war is over.
.
You should be ashamed.
.
I wanted to offer you this dance.
.
I see it's not worth it.
.
Here.
Take my jacket.
Thank you.
I've never had so much to drink.
I've never danced so much.
A Frantz loved to dance.
But not as successful as you were.
If he had had returned, you would have.
No.
Why do you say that?
I would have married him and would have watched.
I understand you were friends.
Your jacket.
Yes.
Thank you.
Thanks to you.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Shit.
.
May I help you?
.
You better now?
.
Are you okay?
.
Don't touch me, you disgust me.
.
Dear Anna,
I must...write this letter.
It is necessary I tell...
Good morning friends.
.
He believes our meetings no longer interests you, Dr.Hoffmeister.
.
.
More than ever.
.
But
.
excuse my absence,
.
this is my turn.
.
Waiter.
.
Yes?
Eight beers, please.
.
Not for me.
.
Seven then. - Six will be enough, Doctor.
.
.
Five.
.
Four.
.
Good.
.
A beer for me, please.
.
We were talking about you.
.
Then it's good that I came.
.
He should have brought your new friend.
.
Of course.
.
It is a good idea.
.
Sirs,
.
this young man has come from France
.
to place flowers on my son's grave.
.
.
I respect that.
.
Did you also want to sing the Marseillaise?
.
.
I don't sing anymore after my son's death.
.
.
And who killed your son?
.
And my son?
.
And my two children?
.
And my son,
.
their children,
.
those of you,
.
and two sons,
.
Who sent them to the front?
.
Who gave them ammunition and bayonets?
.
.
Us.
.
Their parents.
.
Both here and on the other side.
.
Us.
.
We are responsible.
.
And when we killed thousands of their children,
.
we celebrated our victory
.
drinking beer.
.
And when are our children were killed,
.
they celebrated their victory
.
drinking wine.
.
We are parents who drink to the death of our children.
.
Good Morning.
.
Good morning, Adrien.
.
How are you today?
.
Feeling better, Mr.Hoffmeister.
.
Good. Good.
.
Will you come. For dinner?
.
Yes. Yes.
.
Magda prepared her specialty. You will not be disappointed.
.
.
Thank you very much. Yeah.
.
Until tonight.
.
* Beloved country *
.
* Be calm *
.
* Dear homeland, be calm *
* Firm and loyal is the guard *
.
* The guard of the Rhine *
.
* Is firm and loyal, The guard of the Rhine *
My key, please.
.
Let me introduce myself. Kreutz.
.
Adrien Rivolre.
Were you a friend of Frantz's?
.
Yes.
.
And you came to dance with his girlfriend?
.
I don't know what you're talking about.
.
They are pretty, our little Germans, and dance well.
.
Kreutz.
.
Stop it, please.
.
Fool.
Good evening. - Good evening.
.
Is Mr.Rivoire in?
.
No my lady.
.
He left?
.
No, his train leaves tomorrow.
.
And this evening?
.
He left without saying anything.
.
Adrien!
I was waiting for you.
How did that come about?
I had hoped.
Why did you not come to dinner? Why did not you call?
Yes, you're right.
This makes them suffer.
This has to stop! Frantz...
I...
This comedy!
What comedy?
This Franco-German friendship...
I have to confess the truth.
Confess what?
The noise was tremendous.
You cannot imagine.
The battle was terrible.
Not all asleep. Maybe I can get out.
I pocketed, in my heart,
The rose you sent me...
How do you know of this letter?
It was September 15.
On September 15, 1918.
My regiment had camped outside Dormans, in Marne.
That day, we had risen just like any other day.
We crossed the countryside,
calming land.
Suddenly, in a field, an assault occurred.
Some of us made a run for it immediately.
.
So I ran.
I ran to a trench to seek refuge.
Take refuge!
Auxiliary!
Suddenly, I found myself facing a man.
He, a German soldier.
I, a French soldier.
His gaze was so deep, so hopeless.
I never knew if I expressed the sadness of death
or the pity to see myself killing him.
So I fired.
I shot first and he fell.
It was I who killed Frantz, Anna.
No!
Not you.
.
At least he had shot,
I would've been hurt, but, no...
his gun was not even loaded.
He was defenseless.
Then a mortar dropped and I was thrown to his side.
Two bodies,
against one other.
He...
dead.
And I alive.
In his coat, he had a letter.
I read it.
Since then it was...
engraved in me.
That letter...
was meant for you, Anna.
Why did you come here?
To apologize.
To break free.
To know the man I had killed.
Since my arrival
I wanted to tell the truth, but I saw his grave.
You believed in our friendship.
And I didn't dare disappoint.
Thanks to this lie, I found out who was Frantz.
Your family, your home...
his fiancée.
Every day, she loved him a little more,
every day, my suffering grew bigger.
So,
the Louvre,
Manet's paintings,
the violin lessons...
were all lies?
Yes.
Because I'm a coward.
Maybe because we did well, for everyone.
Anna, wait.
My train leaves tomorrow at noon.
I will say it all before I leave.
See you tomorrow.
Good Morning.
.
Good morning, Mr.Rivoire.
.
The bill, please.
.
Tout de suite.
.
I want to meet the Hoffmeisters at home.
It's useless. I told them everything.
And how did they react?
As parents would.
So, you don't want to see me anymore?
Yes.
I understand.
Goodbye.
Wagon 6. Have a good trip.
.
Do you think I could write to you?
I don't think so.
Anna...
I need to write.
Then, address it directly to my name.
I'll read them your letters.
You're right.
Thank you for everything, Anna.
Goodbye.
Anna.
Did you kiss him on our behalf?
.
Yes.
I hope his mother is not too sick.
.
.
Did you tell him we'd like him to come back and play the violin?
.
.
Yes, I did.
.
And when will he return?
.
That would depend on his mother and his work.
.
.
Soon for sure. Two or three months.
.
.
Perfect.
.
Come over to the table and eat.
.
He could have come over to say goodbye.
.
Yes...he apologized.
.
We forgive everything of the youth..
.
My sweetheart Anna.
I write this letter in French,
so that my parents may not read.
I hope you get it. I write in cold and mud.
At any time, the assault may occur.
The noise is tremendous.
You cannot imagine.
The battle be terrible.
All are asleep.
Maybe I could get out.
I keep in my pocket, in my heart,
the rose you had sent me in your last letter.
Promise me, Anna my sweetheart,
if I were to fall...
you will retain the joy of living and be happy.
Why do you do this?
Aren't there enough dead in this war?
Do you live in Dr.Hoffmeister's house?
Do not say anything.
.
Still a little fever.
.
You must eat.
.
This is hot.
.
I'm not hungry.
.
You always had a good appetite. Hm?
.
The bookseller received this book
.
you had asked for.
.
Thank you, Magda.
.
Paul Verlaine
Choix Poetry
A little fresh air.
.
Anna.
.
Hm?
When Frantz died,
.
you held us together
.
and helped us survive.
.
Now it's our turn.
.
You have to get up,
.
you must leave,
.
you must live.
.
I have something for you.
.
What?
.
I'll be back.
.
Yes.
Sorry.
.
What happened? - A letter from Paris.
.
At last! - Hm..uh.
.
Dear Anna,
I write, as promised, a few weeks after my departure.
My return to France was difficult.
But I try to survive.
Enclosed is my letter to Frantz's parents,
which, I know, will not expunge my crime,
but it will help them understand my presence amongst you.
I know, forgiveness is impossible.
I beg you, answer me. I hope for your letter, Anna.
Since my return,
I've taken care of my mother.
She is better.
I told of, my wonderful stay amongst you,
.
.
Frantz's dear family.
In Paris, life goes on.
.
Everyone tries to forget the sufferings of war.
.
.
I'm happy to play again at the 'Orchestre de Paris'.
.
.
Music soothes me...
.
Music soothes me
and makes me happier.
We're up a few months in tour.
As soon as I can, I will go see them.
I promise Dr.Hoffmeister to play Frantz's fiddle.
Dear friends, I hope you are well.
I miss, the pure air of Quedlinburg.
.
.
See you soon,
.
Yours, Adrien.
.
Did you read everything?
.
Yes.
They took your letter well.
Y...
You know, my lies
and all my torments.
God understands you, my child.
.
He condemns lying,
.
but your silence of the fiancé's death
.
.
has a pure intention, that excuses your lack.
.
.
Should I not say anything?
.
What would the truth bring?
.
More pain,
.
more tears.
.
What do you feel for the young Frenchman?
.
.
I don't know anymore.
.
He killed the man I loved.
.
This French soldier,
.
he came to Germany
.
to as for forgiveness.
.
Forgive him.
.
As Jesus forgave his executioners.
.
.
I give you absolution, my child.
.
.
In the Name of the Father and of the Son
and the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
Amen.
.
Good morning, Anna.
.
Good morning, Mr.Kreutz.
.
Are you well?
.
Yes thanks.
.
They told me you were sick.
.
It happened.
.
I'm glad.
.
I behaved in a stupid way.
.
.
Many Germans died in France
.
and that one is angry with the French.
.
I know.
.
I don't share the ideas of Dr.Hoffmeister,
.
.
but he had a brave attitude to welcome a French
.
.
who could have killed his son.
.
Forgive me for what I'm about to repeat again.
.
I know how much you loved Frantz.
.
I met Kreutz this afternoon.
.
And?
.
He asked for my hand again.
.
He is tenacious.
.
And if I were to say 'Yes'?
.
Do you want to marry him?
.
Isn't that what you wanted?
.
That was before meeting Adrien.
.
Dear Adrien,
Forgive me for making you wait for an answer.
Our pain is still profound.
But we know that you are, as Frantz,
are a victim of this horrible war.
You had to kill an enemy in wartime.
You fulfilled your duty as a French soldier.
Today,
I understand and accept your lie.
Pour la France.
.
Autumn is a beautiful season and is ready to see you.
Please write and be sure that this time,
I will answer back soon.
Yours, Anna.
Yes?
Return to sender?
Is he is no longer at that address?
.
Do you have another one?
.
No.
Then we must find him, as Adrien found us.
.
That is impossible, Magda.
.
You know his name,
.
his old address.
.
You'll find him.
.
But what if something happened to him?

It is better to know.
.
You cannot live with a doubt.
.
Anna...
You are young and beautiful,
.
you have life ahead.

Don't miss your chance, travels to France
.
.
and bring him with you.
.
Good trip, Anna.

Look after yourself.

Kiss Adrien for us and tell him we're waiting for him.
.
.
Everything will be fine.

Have a good voyage!
See you soon.

Bye.

Good Morning.
Thank you.
Passports, please.
German?
Yes.
What brings you to France?
I've come to see a friend.
A prisoner?
No, he is French.
A small change, ma'am, please?
There will be something for everyone.
Good morning, young lady.
Where should I take you?
Al Camelia Hotel, Passage des Arcades.
Very well. Get in.
Thank you.
Is this your first time to this hotel?
Yes.
My fiancé stayed there
before the war.
I understand your fiancé.
Sure I would go over as well.
It'll be the 3rd,
on top...
to the left.
Thank you.
Excuse me madam.
I'm looking for Mr.Adrien Rivoire.
Did he live here?
Yes, but not anymore.
Since when?
A few months.
Do you have his new address?
No. I have mails for him.
Would you how I could find him?
No I don't.
Goodbye Miss.
Good morning sir.
Good Morning.
I'm looking for violinist Adrian Rivoire.
Do you know him?
Sorry, I do not know the names of musicians.
Try the Orchestre de Paris.
If you're interested, tickets for tonight are on the left.
Dear Magda, Dear Hans,
.
the trip was good and I have come to Paris.
.
.
Everything is different from what Frantz had told us.
.
.
The war has also changed many a things.
.
.
I sleep as expected at the hotel
.
where Frantz was staying for his studies.
.
Tonight,
.
in the Opera, I will look out for Adrien.
.
Before that I'll go to the Louvre, and see the pictures
.
.
Frantz loved.
.
Good morning gentlemen.
Stay seated.

Good morning sir.
I'm looking for a painting by Manet,
a young man with his head held back.
Manet, will be on the bottom right, madam.
Thank you.
Excuse me. May I? Thank you.
I took care of him
for a week. Then he changed the service.
Was he very sick?
Listen, there are some who go out and others don't.
So he killed himself?
I did not say that, Miss. But he was fragile.
He was an artist.
Listen, best would be
to request a patient consultation registration.
Cemetery of Vassy
Are you all right, Miss?
Excuse me sir.
I am looking for the tomb of Mr.Rivoire.
Rivoire...
He died in August.
Oh yeah! At the end of the road, right.
Thank you.
To My Bridegroom Adore
Anatole Rivoire 15 May 165 - 17 August 1919
Colonel 217th R.I., Officer of the Legion of Honor
Good Morning.
Good Morning.
Is this the home of Mrs.Rivoire?
Yes.
May I see her?
Come in, Miss.
Thank you.
My husband was wounded in Verdun.
Both legs amputated.
After that, he lost the will to live.
And he made sure to end his life.
But it's not Anatole whom you seek, is it Adrien?
Yes.
As I remember,
I met him at the Opera, before the war.
He was a nice boy.
His mother was angry with my husband,
in the matters of inheritance.
Do you know where he might be?
You have come from Germany, is not it?
Yes.
What is your relation with Adrien?
We are friends.
Thank you.
Excuse me sir.
Yes?
I'm looking for the Rivoire family house.
The mansion is that way, outside the city.
Thank you.
Good Morning.
Are you the 'Little Anna'?
Yes.
Good morning, ma'am.
What a surprise!
My son has told me so much about you.
He will be delighted to see you.
Let me kiss you.
Felice, help the Miss, please.
Adrien will not take long. He went for a ride.
Follow me.
Do you understand me?
Do you speak French well?
Yes.
Ah, so much the better!
Since his return, nothing has been easy.
It's better now.
He left Paris, his orchestra.
And he came to live here with me.
It helps to take on the field.
Ah!
Here he is.
Adrien. Look who's here.
My God, Anna!
You are here!
In France.
How did you find me?
I was in Paris
for a visit and...
your aunt gave me your address.
I'm so happy.
Sit down.
Which hotel are you putting up, Anna?
I don't know yet.
There is a lovely hostel...
No, no...
we have a place here.
Yes of course.
We will have dinner
with some friends and organize
a small concert. You're one of us.
Thank you.
Dime, Anna.
How is he?
Who?
Mr.Hoffmeister.
Very good.
Really?
Yes...
Life goes on.
Why did you not reply to my letter?
I was desperate. I waited on for an answer, an answer.
I know.
I should have written sooner.
It wasn't easy.
Was it because of Hoffmeister?
No...
They have forgiven you.
I came to tell you that personally.
And you, Anna?
Me too.
Thank you.
That's the most beautiful thing I wanted to hear.
Although I will never forgive myself.
In time, Adrien.
Only time will help you forget.
Did you still want to swim?
Would you accompany me?
Yes.
Did you learn to swim?
No.
I was waiting on.
You know, Anna...
On my return from Germany, I...
I wanted to kill myself.
Me too.
Really?
I did not want to suffer anymore,
nor be unhappy,
but...
I was selfish.
Yes.
You also have to live for others.
Anna, may I present, Fanny.
Good morning, Anna.
Good Morning.
Nice to meet you.
Adrien told me beautiful things about you.
You will hear it all tonight, Anna.
Fanny has a wonderful voice.
Don't exaggerate.
But, Fanny, sings divinely...
is it not, Adrien?
Yes, that's true.
Good. Your room is ready, Anna.
Felice will accompany. It's on the first floor.
Here's your room, Miss.
Thank you.
Enter.
Excuse me...hope I didn't bother?
No...I was arranging my things.
Precisely, I wondered if you'd
need some clothes for dinner.
I guess you weren't scheduled for the meeting tonight.
We are almost the same size.
It's perfect.
You look great.
I'll help with the belt.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Anna...
for all you have done for Adrien.
I did nothing.
Yes. You have did so,
when he needed most,
you could have refused.
His whole family thought Adrien had lost his mind.
I was the one who supported him
when he decided to go to Germany.
He wanted to be forgiven,
take the place of a man he killed.
But...
these things are impossible.
It never replaces a loved one, is not it?
I don't know.
Your fiancé was called Frantz?
Yes.
My brother's name was Francois.
He was 20 years and...
He died at the front, too.
Adrien told me that you played
the piano very well.
Yes a little bit.
Will you accompany us tonight?
The bells rang all day, they did not stop.
Even the deaf heard them.
It was maddening. We wondered if we could ever sleep.
And we have not yet slept.
You had to have stuff cotton in our ears.
And you, Adrien, were you
in Paris on Armistice Day?
Yes...in the house of fools.
And you, Anna?
How was it in Germany?
How dare you ask that question?
Excuse me, I messed up.
But it's also interesting to know, right? Hm?
The bells also rang.
We felt relieved...
and even there was
a dance.
You see, Fanny,
it was not just France
that danced.
Yes...on the corpses.
Does anyone prefer cheese?
With pleasure.
Ah...
Armand, cheese, please.
* Night of Stars *
* Under the sails *

Sorry.
I cannot.
Excuse her,
the long journey has has tired her.
For that matter...
why has she come to France?
To see Adrien, I guess.
Anna, what are you doing?
I should have never come.
Why do you say that?
It's not my place.
I also would not have been able to
see past the Hoffmeister.
Did you think of Frantz?
Is that it?
No.
No, I did not think Frantz.
I thought of you, Adrien.
Of me?
You haven't understood anything.
Anna...Anna. Wait. Anna, calm down.
Where will you sleep tonight?
Stay. Go early tomorrow morning, if you want.
Nobody has anything against you.
I'll explain to them that...
Forgive me, Anna.
You're right.
Do as you wish.
Good night, Anna.
Will you accompany her?
Yes.
Did Fanny say something?
No.
Is she not jealous?
She has no reason to be.
Why did she come here?
I've already told you Anna came here on her own will.
Don't make fun of me. I wasn't born yesterday.
She came to...
to say that she had forgiven me. That's all.
What innocence! What naivety!
That's why I adore you!
Don't touch me.
Adrien...
My dear...
Anna...are you ready?
Yes very good.
I'll get the car.
You know, Anna,
my son is a fragile boy.
Don't make him suffer.
I'm not the one hurting your child, madam.
It's Frantz.
Thank you.
How long have you known Fanny?
Since our childhood.
We stopped seeing each other when I went to Paris.
When I returned from the front,
we met again.
She helped me a lot.
She too,
lost someone in the family.
Her brother?
Yes.
I liked his brother.
You know, Anna...
My mother wants this marriage.
She is reassuring.
Fanny, she...
She has courage. I love her forever.
Would..
would you accept to come to our wedding, in a month?
Fanny and I...
We would be very happy.
I don't believe so.
Paris Express will now leave. Close the doors, please.
Anna...
It's too late.
I am happy, Anna.
Hans?
.
Yes?
A letter from Anna.
.
Anna? - Yes.
.
.
Dear Parents
.
I write from Paris
.
where I finally found Adrien.
.
He's fine
.
and embraces you.
.
He is now the premier violinist
.
at the Orchestre de Paris,
.
and every night I go to the Opera
.
to hear it.
.
For private concerts,
.
sometimes he asks me to accompany the piano.
.
.
We spent wonderful moments,
.
I did go Paris
.
and all places
.
Frantz had told us about.
.
Yesterday at the Louvre,
.
I saw the paintings of Manet.
.
I would have loved
.
if you were here
.
to share these moments.
.
I don't know when I'll come back,
.
I am happy in Paris,
.
in the city
.
Frantz loved.
.
Take care of yourself.
.
All my Love,
.
Yours, Anna.
.
Do you also love this painting?
Yes...
It made me want to live.
