Something odd happened a few weeks ago.
In the paper bin,
along with some TV guides,
I found a little girl's diary.
It was in green ink,
so I wrote it off as uninteresting.
I took it thinking I'd fill the blank pages
with something useful.
I began reading it,
got used to the dreamy handwriting,
and noted that it actually was interesting.
It wasn't the story that struck me
but the mysterious reticence it conveyed.
As if some things had been left out,
yet were oppressively present.
In the trivial man I easily identify with,
the trivial facts evoked
a newfound intensity
far beyond the quality of the lines.
I was truly disappointed when a page ended.
I wanted all I felt to emerge.
Or just more lines of rambling innocence
for me to ponder on.
She just stopped writing, without warning
and without saying she was done.
Did she find a better diary, a better life?
I kept the diary and continued writing it.
Because I liked that life.
What follows
was inspired by a true story.
The true story was inspired by a lie.
The lie is rather uninspired.
The following images are graphic.
A family tragedy occurred
today in Spinaceto.
It appears that the parents of a small baby
killed her by drowning her in the bath.
They then leapt from the balcony
of their room
and perished.
The young couple had boxes
of anxiolytics and spasmolytics.
Other guests
had heard the parents arguing
and threatening to commit suicide.
No one intervened...
We've launched a new
soap for sensitive skin.
A mild, foaming product.
I was involved
in the idea and its creation.
Not to mention the new range of shampoo.
Special no-tear shampoos
for kids' little eyes.
The job might sound stressful.
But you gotta break
through that glass ceiling.
Or what's the fucking point of living?
"Want to sell sugar water
for the rest of your life
or come with me and change the world?"
Steve Jobs. What a man!
I read his book. Mindblowing stuff!
All I can afford to read now are job ads.
- What kind of job are you after?
- Any job.
Anything suitable, because...
I've been idle for months.
It's bad for the mind.
You're not idle.
You're always on the move.
Where? At home.
I'm a stay-at-home dad.
You're the breadwinner.
Right, let's talk about something nice.
Kids, get your report cards.
They got great report cards.
Over there, over there.
You start.

Second European Language, A+.

Viola needs to put in a little more effort.
She's lacking here and there,
but we're working on it.
Her support teacher's a dickhead.
- Pietro!
- Well, not a dickhead, he's dumb.
Good with disabled kids,
but not normal ones.
You're right, he is a bit dumb.
What a mess.
I used to like yard sales.
But lately they've become lame.
Neighbors sell the same boring old stuff.
Nothing sells. You just get sunburn.
How much is this?
Like, a ton of money.
How much you got?
Nothing.
Not enough.
Yeah, but how much is it?
30 euros.
- Dad, can I have 30 euros?
- Huh?
- Can I have 30 euros?
- What for?
An educational thing.
Ask your mom.
Mom, can I have 30 euros?
Since we've sold a few things...
- Bring me the change.
- Okay.
I'm not really sure it costs 30 euros.
Might be worth way more.
I'll go ask Mom.
Hey, Mom...
How much is that thing?
That metal... detector?
15 euros.
So...
since you got a lot left over,
you wanna...?
Go fuck yourself.
Hey, boy! You'll feel better soon.
It'd be easier if they
didn't say "put down."
"Pacify".
No... "repacify."
No, wait... Geremia!
Have a minute with him.
Say goodbye to Woofie. Say goodbye.
C'mon, say bye to him!
Geremia, don't be like that.
This disease, it messes with his head.
He knows you said bye and love him.
Trust me.
C'mon.
He came around.
Remember how he was?
Always miserable. That rascal!
Look at him! He's crying!
Rabies beats depression, you bet!
Woofie, I'm taking you on a vacation!
I'll be back in two hours at the most.
I'll pick up some pizza.
Want a bruschetta?
Play soccer, stay here. Don't worry.
Let's go, Woofie!
Mom!
We're out of that fucking sauce!
You're out of your mind.
It's the teachers'
lounge, so it's mine too.
So it's the only fridge I have at work.
I don't have to share the food I put in it.
Otherwise you can't bring food from home
and have to keep feeding coins
into the vending machine.
I mean, come on!
Guerrini! Hey, spaz, what's up?
They need me at the trattoria.
I'm going now.
My first year in middle school ended today.
Our summer reading:
The Canterville Ghost.
I didn't tell anyone I'd already read it.
I have plenty to do this summer. Maybe
I'll even fall in love like last year.
Hey, asshole...
Move your feet.
Can I have one?
Okay.
It's good.
C'mon, laugh.
When's it due?
In two months.
But...
are you really sure you want a baby?
Oh, fuck it.
How did the flute lesson go?
It seemed a bit...
thrown together.
The hall wasn't equipped.
We waited an hour for the teacher.
He showed up late.
Great.
So we'll switch then.
Right?
They offer lots of classes.
And it's good for the kids...
to learn lots of different things.
To learn to be flexible.
The first lesson's free anyway, right?
Dennis?
Spit it out.
Here, have a sip of water.
- Bruno, he's choking.
- Here, drink this.
He's choking on the meat!
What the fuck am I meant to do?
Spit it out. Spit it out!
- He's choking!
- What the fuck? Spit it out!
Spit it out!
Are you okay, sweetie?
Jesus!
No, stop.
Alessia...
Alessia, calm down.
Hey!
He's okay, c'mon.
What happened?
What happened?
C'mon now!
C'mon, everything's fine.
C'mon.
C'mon, dear, calm down.
C'mon on, let's eat.
I'm hungry.
What the fuck was that about?
C'mon, don't piss me off!
Let's eat.
Okay, then.
We can't even eat a fucking steak...
in peace now!
Fucked up world.
See what you did?
You made your dad cry.
We went to the free beach.
Dad said we go to the beach to be
in the sea.
The sea's the same for rich and poor.
But he was the one who didn't enjoy it.
What about your baby?
Had her.
But she's in the hospital. In an incubator.
Gonna get her at the end of summer.
It's almost hot.
Here we are!
A big hearty snack for everyone. Dig in.
Good kids, studying on summer vacation.
Every mother's dream.
What are you doing?
Finishing this project
before school starts.
There's watermelon too.
Don't eat the seeds,
they'll grow in your belly.
See you later.
Dad got a pool on sale.
We put it in the yard.
A cheap alternative to a normal summer.
Lots of people were in our situation,
so our pool and yard became
the neighborhood's pool and yard.
Bruno!
Me and Susanna, we're so grateful.
- I'm swamped at work.
- No sweat.
And I know the kids are safe here.
No sweat. Don't mention it.
I'm here for my daughter. You seen her?
Uh...
There she is.
Get your flip-flops on.
Let's go.
- Thank Uncle Bruno.
- Thank you.
That fucking pool and shithole house.
Take it easy, Pietro.
I won't fucking take it easy, Susanna.
I won't!
Where did she get them if not from there?
That pool, that pool...
Head lice.
That family of cheapskate,
communist leeches!
You... you look beautiful.
This morning we woke up to terrible news.
Someone wrecked the pool with a pickaxe.
Dennis and I stared in dismay at the pool.
It was gouged beyond repair.
Dad had to make us snap out of it.
I wish I had his mettle.
Human cruelty doesn't shock him anymore.
You buy a pool, let others use it
and get screwed over by jealous people.
Dad said it must've been gypsies.
Gypsies with pickaxes.
Gypsies without swimming pools.
Done.
Pietro... Take down the balloons outside.
It took me half an hour to put them up.
But if Viola sees them when she gets back
it won't be a surprise party.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY VIOLA
Read it. Go on.
"Very best wishes from the Placido family."
It's beautiful.
- Do you like it?
- Yes.
Alessia chose it.
There you go.
Over there, Bruno. Get in the picture.
- Me?
- C'mon, it's nice. The whole family.
Smile, all together.
Huddle up.
That's good. Hold on.
Sorry.
She's not wearing underwear.
Look carefully.
With that asshole...
She could milk a cock dry with that ass.
- That dress she's wearing.
- It's on purpose.
She did it on purpose.
I'd slice it off her from below!
Creampie your face.
You whore, I'll fucking show you.
I'll stick it in her mouth.
Do it without a damn word.
Just stick it in her mouth.
I'll get her alone. I don't give a fuck.
I'll even do it tonight.
It'd only take us a second.
Just look at how she acts.
Fuck you laughing at, you slut?
Want some fun?
All those cocks banging
her ass every night!
HISTORY
COLLEAGUE FUCKED AND JIZZED ON
ASS FUCKED AFTER SHOWER...
Doesn't your dad notice you go through it?
I tell him it has a
better camera than mine.
If I ask him he lets me use it.
But we're having sex at
least once too, right?
Then we'll have done everything.
Okay... okay.
Any free time this week?
Between Wednesday and Friday?
So you like giving blow jobs?
It's better to turn up at the end.
Trust me, I know these parties.
Girls invited me nearly every week.
They kept inviting me.
Some I went to, others I didn't.
Depending on whose party it was.
They were delighted when they saw me.
They didn't mind me not bringing gifts.
I was the gift.
Know what a guy at work said to me today?
That I look like Antonio Banderas.
The one in the commercial with the hens.
Imagine that!
So what if we don't go to this party?
We'll pick up sandwiches
with ham and cheese.
I'm starving. To hell with them!
I don't even like them.
Especially the little girl. She's strange.
- Yes!
- Well done!
Hey, ace.
Hot, isn't it?
Come in.
Sit down here.
Sorry...
the place is a mess.
Don't you ever stop working?
Just tutoring a couple of blockheads.
Easy money.
What about you?
Never cutting me any slack.
Homework in August?
No, It's the same old topic. Just that...
I still don't quite get it.
Thank God. Or you'd be a genius.
And geniuses lead crappy lives.
Show me what you've got there.
Some stuff I don't get.
Okay.
We'll go over this now.
But this afternoon you go stare
at the girls in their swimsuits.
That's my boy!
Go on, that's right!
Go on!
Look at that!
You're flying!
Great!
Go on!
Look at that son of a bitch!
You take after me, damn it! You hear?
You take after me!
You take after me!
Good boy!
Yeah!
You take after me! You got that?
Fuck yeah! Great!
Goddamn it! You're so fucking good at it!
Yeah!
Fuck!
Yeah!
Come here, damn you!
How do you feel?
Better?
Damn.
I have leftovers.
They were going to the dog.
I said, "Forget the dog. I've got a kid."
Wanna eat in here or at the table with me?
Don't worry. Leave it to me, okay?
Mushrooms and sausage.
Smells amazing.
Look here.
Eat up.
I've got some more good news.
I ran into that girl's
mother, you know who.
The one whose party we were going to.
She heard you got measles.
She was glad. Her daughter hasn't had 'em.
She says this is the best chance.
Her friends' kids had 'em.
No one can help her.
We'll plan a nice afternoon here.
She'll bring her daughter by.
You hang with her, she gets the measles.
You get your chance. Happy?
You nearly missed out with that scowl.
Have a piece of pizza for Dad.
C'mon, have some with me.
I really feel like fucking.
They got stuck in traffic.
They'll be here soon.
Here they are. Get up.
Yeah, it's them. They're here.
Wave.
Smile.
Smile!
Go, say hello to the girl. Go on.
Lovely ladies!
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
- How are you?
- Good.
- How nice! Cookies?
- Hi.
- No, a cake.
- A cake!
- I've already had measles.
- Me too!
This is a cake I baked. It turned out good.
So I brought half.
I've got ice cream, but I prefer cake.
- As you prefer.
- Of course.
- Okay.
- Right, let's go in.
- Let's go.
- This way.
This is my home.
And his too. Our home, that is.
- We're out in the country.
- Lovely.
Dad planted the trees. He died a year ago.
- Sorry.
- He planted that when I was born.
We're renovating. The bricks'll go soon.
We have two entrances.
We'll take this one.
- Come in.
- Okay.
- Let's leave them. We're boring.
- True.
- Can you hold the cake a moment?
- Of course.
Geremia, come here a sec.
There's protection in the shoe rack.
Just in case...
Please, make yourself at home.
- How beautiful!
- Later, Viola.
- She's so beautiful!
- Yes.
Mommy's darling.
- It's all on one floor. To the right.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
- You're alone?
Yes, yes.
- Yes, my husband...
- Put it on the bananas.
Okay.
- Wanna do it now?
- Now...
What time is it now?
Dunno, about four.
- All right.
- Should I lie down?
I think so.
Damn, it's scorching.
Come here.
- Gonna get undressed?
- If you say so.
Okay, listen...
This won't work.
I'm not used to this.
It's just very weird.
It's all very weird.
Tell you what...
You stay here.
I'll go behind there a minute.
I'll focus, I'll calm down.
And I'll come back ready to roll, okay?
Okay.
Why don't you wear your wig like this?
Like what?
Here, like this. No, wait.
There, like this.
You're still beautiful.
Of course, I know.
Think you already infected me?
Dunno.
Dunno if know if I can.
C'mon, don't be so selfish. Give it to me.
Give it to me!
It's nice when you smile.
Then the measles can get out and into me.
Or I'll kiss you.
I'll get it over with and go home with Mom.
What's it gonna be?
I'm fine even if you just keep me company.
It makes me feel good.
You reading my palm?
- Yes.
- What does it say?
None of your damn business.
Bye! Drive carefully!
Drive slowly! See you soon!
So? How did it go?
Look what you won, little man.
A beer. Let's have a drink.
Do you realize how strange life is?
I'd have banged her mom,
but I couldn't.
She talked about her
husband's job and shit.
You had fun and that's plenty for me.
That's what matters to your dad.
If you didn't know that
already, you do now.
C'mon, let's toast!
To this fucking summer!
Hey, dimwit, two minutes and I'm off.
I'm usually anxious at the end of vacation.
I count down time while trying to stop it
up until the night before.
But the day still arrives.
Dad opens the door shouting, "Wake up!"
This year I wasn't anxious
and didn't do any kind of countdown.
I just watched a movie.
I think Dennis and I had cooled down.
We matured.
Our dads just woke us up.
Damn you! Asshole!
Cocksucker! Damn you! Fuck you!
I waited half an hour!
Don't you have a car?
They took my license away.
Why?
You making a pass at me, kid?
How d'you think you're doing?
Awesome.
Get bent.
Listen, if I tell you a secret
will you promise not to tell anyone?
Like that you're a fag?
No, really.
What is it?
I'm making a bomb
to blow up the whole neighborhood.
Then it'll all be over.
But I'm not just working on the project.
I'm the one making the decisions.
Get the fuck outta here!
I'm telling you because of your baby...
Shut the fuck up!
I'm off to work.
Your cousin called.
She's coming by later.
The kid was making a bomb at his house,
in his bedroom.
He kept it there.
They say they called in the bomb squad.
They took it all away.
But it was very dangerous.
Everyone was in danger,
not just the family.
I'm at a loss for words.
I've heard he's a kind of...
that he's strange, like disabled.
Yeah, I'm speechless.
Yeah, if you consider that this kid
actually kept a bomb on his bedroom desk.
Just like that!
And his father said he knew
nothing about it.
He said he never even noticed.
Because...
his son told him...
he needed it for his school project.
You're right, we're all speechless.
Dalila?
- Dalila?
- Sorry, I have to go.
I have a business call.
Bye. Bye.
I'm going out for a few rounds.
- Do you trust me?
- Sure... shouldn't I?
Yukari!
Those are your friends? No way!
Sorry, Tommy, but I only saw him, and...
But that's Oscar, my alien friend.
An alien? But he's not small and green.
The young ones are. I was once.
He's amazing. Why are you down here?
It all began an hour ago.
I had just started training in the park...
Caligula! Where are you?
What's wrong, Mom?
Nothing, Alessia. Be quiet a sec.
My period. Mommy's got her period.
Listen, Mommy's sick of cooking today.
Go see a movie and get some popcorn.
- Go.
- A hundred euros?
Go on, move it! Go on.
How was the movie? Good?
Was it?
Good kids.
Listen, feel like going for a ride?
Dad doesn't feel like going home yet.
No, please, I'm tired.
- And we have school tomorrow.
- You do?
Of course.
Well, it's Dad's decision.
We're going for a ride anyway.
Dad?
Can I ask you something?
What's that, Dennis?
Well...
you and Mom, I mean...
are you okay?
I mean...
is everything all right between you?
Get out.
- Get out.
- No, Dad!
Alessia, I'm talking to Dennis.
Get out, Dennis. Get out!
Come on!
Come on.
Say that again!
- What did you say?
- Nothing.
Here's how things are between me and Mom.
Come here! Come here! Come here!
How are things between us?
How are things? Goddamn motherfucker!
Come here!
Get up! I didn't fucking touch you!
A piece of shit, that's what you are!
Get in and shut up! Don't even breathe!
Me and Mom are fine!
Me and Mom!
Nothing to say, Alessia?
One peep and there'll be trouble!
No crying!
I'm the one who should be crying here!
Today we went to the country. How strange.
It wasn't Sunday, Saturday, or a holiday.
We said nothing because we wanted to go.
As usual, I got car sick,
but as soon as I got out I felt better.
I felt good on that lovely green grass.
But Dad had a toothache
that didn't go away.
You should be happy to
have parents like us.
You should be really happy.
Understand?
Because it's normal for things
to not always go the way you'd like.
Okay?
Even Mommy, when she was little
and lived with Grandma,
wasn't allowed to do lots of stuff
and wanted to leave home.
Alessia!
Mom!
Where is everyone?
Dennis?
Mom?
Dad?
You're the best father I know.
And you're the best mother I know.
I like to eat just the crust too. Look.
Like this. You take it all off. Try it.
Okay?
So, I decided to take
you out of that school.
There's a lot of turmoil there.
New house, new school, new city.
We move on.
So no school for you
while I find a new job.
I'd head to Rome. What do you say?
It's a pain in the ass living out here.
All self-righteous and backwards.
A bunch of shitheads.
I can ask my cousin...
in Casal Bruciato if he can put us up.
We'll share the bed in the living room.
It'll be a riot!
Remember when we used to do it every night?
What a blast.
Kick-ass.
Hi.
You going away too?
Yeah.
I found this in a bag of chips.
It's yours. It's a gift.
Okay. Bye.
Hey? Hey!
Let's go and get some meat and fruit.
Let's go.
Whatcha got there? Lemme see.
What is this crap? Lose it.
C'mon, let's go.
C'mon! Get a move on.
Come in, please.
- Nice sunny day, isn't it?
- Hello.
- Sit down.
- Hello.
Right then...
I'm sure you've heard about
all the pressure
that has been directed towards us,
from both parents
and teachers at the school.
Although...
Although unintentionally,
you taught the students
what they later put into practice.
- I'm talking about the two bombs.
- Precisely!
How was I to know the kid was nuts?
If his parents didn't notice, how could I?
Unfortunately,
the situation that has arisen
means we have no choice
but to replace you.
- Really?
- Yes.
Well, don't think you've upset me.
"Oh my God!
Fired by this school of bungling idiots!"
And anyway,
the looks I got from everyone gave it away.
So there's no need to act all haughty.
It's how things stand. Now please go.
We have many people to see this morning.
Of course, I see.
Could I at least teach today's class?
Of course.
Good morning.
Is that our daughter crying?
No, can't you tell it's a dog?
No, it sounds like our daughter.
Already a bitch.
You're such an asshole!
Be serious.
I am being serious.
You're her damn father.
And you're her mother.
We are being serious.
We were right to leave that place.
She'd be a goner staying with your mom.
Yeah, yeah.
True. It's the first step though.
We gotta grow up, babe.
We'll grow up.
For once.
We can only grow up once.
All right.
We'll make plans tomorrow in Spinaceto.
We'll check into a guesthouse.
I know a second assistant pizza guy.
He makes a ton of money, so I will too.
If you get bored, you can find an odd job.
You can work as a barista or waitress.
Like the idea? We'll have two incomes.
Then we can go dancing in Ibiza in summer.
Ibiza!
Ibiza, anywhere we want.
Anyway, babe...
we have to go to the registry office.
We were wrong to name our baby
after a Vasco Rossi song.
Don't laugh, we both chose this name.
We should've named her Sara.
- Like the Meneguzzi song, remember?
- Yeah.
- That was our song.
- Yeah, okay.
What the hell?
What the fuck!
What the fuck!
In the sun
You decided to set off
In search of a different life
To live
Oh, Sara!
Walking towards the sun
Against the others, against everyone
You want to live every second of your life
Vilma!
You crying over the name?
Hey, we'll change the name.
Hey, Vilma.
Hey.
Wake up, it's four o'clock.
- I need to use the toilet a sec.
- Okay.
Dennis.
Alessia.
Alessia.
Kids.
Kids...
Oh my God! Help!
Help!
Oh, my God!
Bruno!
Help!
Oh, my God!
Help!
Bruno!
Oh, my God!
Bruno!
Strange I've never mentioned Malathion.
Because it's a very interesting subject.
Ma...
la...
thion.
Yes.
How many of you have a yard?
All of you I bet, right?
I'm sure that your parents keep
a container of Malathion in the garage.
Malathion is a very powerful insecticide.
It helped us defeat the medfly in the '80s.
It paralyzes the nerve structures
in mosquitoes and other insects
and eliminates the eggs of adult lice.
Obviously, it is a very dangerous product.
An irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor,
it may be the most poisonous
agricultural antiparasitic on the market.
All the same...
it is freely available in any shop.
And it is very cheap too.
Ada?
Darling, wake up.
I'm going downstairs to work.
I'll see you at lunch, okay?
The pages of the diary run out here.
At the end I wrote smaller and smaller,
right up to the margins.
I was tempted to buy a
new diary to continue,
so I went to a stationer's
and leafed through a few of them.
They were excellent, quite cheap and blank.
But it didn't feel the same.
I didn't know what I would write in them.
I lacked inspiration.
So I didn't buy a new diary.
I bought sports magazines,
resumed the monotony of soccer transfers,
slicing melons and cursing vacationers.
That's what I did.
I advise you to do the same.
- Hey, buddy!
- Oh, man!
Come here!
Goddamn, you look terrific!
- What have you done?
- What?
- You balding?
- Stop!
Old man!
My washing machine's broken.
Rosaria's doing my laundry.
- She's not dead?
- She'll bury us all.
Look at this kid! You've gotten big!
Give your uncle a kiss.
Hey, c'mon now! Nice! Come inside.
- Gimme your bag.
- Here you go.
- You brought cookies?
- Yeah, from downstairs.
I'm glad you're staying a while.
- Me too.
- I'll introduce you to the locals.
Go on, sit down.
- Remember them?
- Sure.
Mimmo.
"The Prince," "the She-Wolf"!
Listen... what about Omar?
Been gone two years.
He end up in the can?
Murdered. Got shot in the park nearby.
I didn't know that.
Don't mind the mess.
I couldn't clean 'cause I had a fever.
- Ignore it.
- No worries.
I'll sleep here and you sleep in my room.
- No...
- I'm happy to.
Okay, I appreciate it.
We appreciate it, that is.
This lunatic was making a bomb on his own.
- All on his own.
- Smart kid.
He takes after us.
- Know where this kid can work?
- Where?
At NASA.
We got something like NASA here?
Of course, we must! We're not idiots.
Okay.
Let's eat.
Mortadella, buffalo mozzarella,
and wine.
To hell with our enemies!
- I love you, man.
- Love you too, big time.
Great day we've had.
We'll get up at seven tomorrow morning.
We'll go look for a cheap grinder.
Then we'll go to your uncle's garage.
First we'll have a cappuccino
and croissant.
At the cafÃ©. Sound good?
Okay.
Good night.
I feel guilty for telling this senseless,
sad and even pessimistic story.
Maybe you deserved a more realistic,
normal, everyday type of story.
Not the ranting of someone bored with life.
I apologize.
Let's start from scratch.
- Too loud? Should I turn it down?
- No.
I can't sleep.
The following images are graphic.
A family tragedy occurred today
in Spinaceto.
It appears that the parents of a small baby
killed her by drowning her in the bath.
They then leapt
from the balcony of their room
and perished.
The young couple had boxes
of anxiolytics and spasmolytics.
Other guests had heard the parents arguing
and threatening to commit suicide.
No one intervened because after the fight
everything went quiet for an hour.
More on this tragedy
in our next newscast.
