what you can't face,
and I need you to
tell me the truth.
I didn't.
Julia, if you
don't face it,
you can't change.
And I'll never be
able to trust you.
You need to tell me.
Just tell me.
Say it.
He was in the closet,
playing with
dry-cleaning bags.
He was pretending
to be a ghost,
and I kept telling
him not to,
but he didn't listen.
He never listens.
You know that.
But you weren't there.
You were never there,
even when we were together.
It was always just me and him,
and me and him,
and I had to show him
what could happen.
I had to protect him.
I'm so sorry.
(CRYING)
I'm so sorry.
Okay-
Thank you.
It'll be okay, please.
Yeah, it'll be okay.
Okay.
I'm never gonna let
you see him again.
What?
Get out.
No.
Get the fuck out!
No, you said that if I
said that I did it...
Get out!
No, I lied!
Get out!
I just said it because...
Get the fuck out of here!
No! No!
Get out!
No, I lied!

SCOTT: Hi.
Thanks for picking up.
I didn't know it was you.
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.
I'm fine, Scott.
How are you?
(SIGHS)
I don't know
what to do, Terry.
I don't know how
to forgive myself.
Do you know how
long she talked about
showing you how
she could swim
whenever you got back
from wherever you were?
Please don't.
She was always trying
to get your attention.
All you had to
do was watch her,
and you couldn't
even do that.
You walked away to
take a phone call.
It was 30 seconds.
She wasn't in the pool.
I was gone for 30 seconds.
You know, I never asked you,
but did you make that deal?
Did you get that
contract, Scott?
You keep trying to
forgive yourself.
I never will.
Okay-

It's a lot of work.
I can have it finished
in three months.
Does she know
you're doing this?
People are gonna
know it's Anna.
Six months from now,
she'll be the punch line
at every cocktail
party in New York.
You can do that to her?
It's the weakest story.
It's the strongest choice.
(SIGHS)
Well?
Okay-
Hi.
He didn't want this?
No, it's for you.
He asked me to pour it.
He did?
Why?
She asked him to
take care of you.
Who did?
In the elevator.
She asked him to
take care of you.
How do you know?
He told me when he
asked for the milk.
Did he say anything else?
Did she say
anything else to him?
No.
She didn't say
that she was sorry?
No.
What are you doing?
Eating the whole
pancake? Yeah?

I don't have anything left.
Will you take me,

Just take me.
Yes.

Hi.
How's Rome?
You know, warm.
I love that tiny apartment
on the piazza.
So, did you, um,
finish reading it?
Last night.
It's good.
You're not just saying that?
No.
It's good.
Thanks.
Must have been hard
for you to read it.
How you live for her smile?
How she's the love
of your life?
Why would that bother me?
If I could've trusted
anyone else to read it...
Stop trying to get
sympathy, Michael.
I'm sure I'll be reading
this conversation
in the next draft.
You really don't feel
a thing, do you?
Is she there?
No. (SIGHS)
You're lying again.
She left me.
Couple of months ago.
You told her that
you were writing
about her and her father?
No.
She read my journal.
Oh, God, Michael.
I'm cold.
I just came in from a swim.
I'm glad you're
using the pool again.
You used his name.
Robbie.
Yeah, I'm gonna change it.
Don't.
It happened in a moment.
It wasn't your fault.
He just so wanted
to make you proud.
It wasn't a business
call, Elaine.
I lied.
It wasn't business.
Who was it?
God, Michael.
Does she know it was
her on the phone?
