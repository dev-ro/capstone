What do we do now?
Shut up!
We've got to get home!
Come on, it's safe.
We go.
Stop it.
Stop crying!
Aron, letâ€™s go.
It is Tuvia.
If I were a German,
you would be dead.
Papa and mama... they killed them.
- I know.
Big brother returns.
You saw them?
Where is your wife and child?
Hiding in the south.
I'll bring them when
it's safe.
And Riva?
- No good, she wouldn't leave.
You're still...
- She is still my wife.
A rich wife...
Tell me Tuvia,
why did you come back?
Do you have a plan?
The police will be after us.
We've run from the police our whole life,
do you think this is a good time to stop?
We know these woods,
they will never find us in here.
I told them to stay here.
I miss Papa.
I can't believe
that he is dead.
We do not know he is.
The Police captain?
- I told him about Dad.
But we don't know that he did it.
- Then we go and ask him if he did it.
Koscik had a pistol,
he showed it to me once.
One pistol is nothing.
We need rifles. Machine Guns.
- What's next? You're gonna take on the whole German army?
- Listen, just because...
Our child is hurt.
Lay her down here.
We cannot feed them.
I go and ask Koscik for food.
- And the pistol.
And the pistol.
I only have four bullets.
Thank you.
Your father was a good man.
He said the same of you.
Ignore the bitch. To the dead.
God rest their souls.
I live with it.
Can you imagine?
To the barn.
Quiet!
I'm sorry, but they have to go with you.
- What am I supposed to do with them?
These agents...
were they the ones who killed my parents?
Why is it so fucking hard
being friends with a Jew?
Try being one.
Who is that?
Where are we going?
You sat at the back in school...
I am Shamon Haretz.
- I thought you were dead.
I'm already half dead.
I heard you speaking about your parents.
I'm very sorry...
The other brother?
What was his name? The wise one?
Zus, he is with the others too.
- You are hiding here in the forest?
There has been trouble before maybe, with the police?
So you got to the forest. A wise choice.
A wise choice for a stupid schoolboy.
My whole life I presumed that reaching out
was the right way to live.
I had no doubt that this is God's way.
This isn't...
You forgive me if recent events have
somewhat shaken my resolve.
Just like school. I have no
idea what you are talking about.
You're not hungry?
The little one doesn't talk?
He saw things.
I sent you for food and you bring more mouths to feed.
- You sent me?
It was Bernicki who killed Papa.
Did you at least get your pistol?
There are only four bullets.
I will have to make them count.
On your knees.
On behalf of my parents...
David and Bella Bielski.
For my brothers and for all the others.
Only one left.
His sons.
How was it?
How was what?
- Shoot them.
It was good, no?
- Shut up.
And what about these others?
- I don't know.
The women will slow us down.
Your old teacher...
What? Are you afraid he's gonna
spank you for forgetting your homework?
We have to be able to move, Tuvia. And quickly
- I agree, but they're here.
We'll sleep further up the trail. If someone comes
we'll stumble on them first and we can escape.
But no more.
No more.
I know...
Tamara, you remember cousin Zus.
Go and sit by the fire.
Alasar, he's Isabel's youngest.
This is Isaac Malbin, he's from Minsk.
Find them something to eat.
Tuvia, I have pity for them all but...
- They are family.
And how will we feed this family?
We do more water in the soup.
And this one?
She is family?
What the fuck!
Have you never used a hammer before?
What is it you do?
I suppose you have to say I...
I was,... I am an intellectual.
This is a job?
I published a small magazine.
Actually, it is a journal.
More like a pamphlet.
This is Lyla.
Lyla's my forest wife.
I see.
Congratulations.
Interesting concept...
- As long as you have a place in hiding.
Hello boys, what can
we do for you?
Food. We want food.
These two shits are really holding themselves...
You have the balls to shoot me, little shit?
We have food.
No, I want to see if the two little shits
have the balls to shoot me.
You like to shoot Jews, little shit, huh?
You are Jews?
- No, we are the Gestapo.
Put down the gun.
- Or perhaps you prefer me to shove it up your ass?
Look at me. Where are you from?
- Polidiska. We haven't eaten in two days.
My name is Peretz and this is Jacov.
Two days ago, there were 3000
Jews in Polidiskya and now... there are 50.
Me and him, we hid in a wall.
You know a woman?
Sonya Bielski?
We knew her.
There was a child...
I should have protected her.
Sonya!
Mama...
Papa...
So many dead.
- I know.
Why not us?
- I don't know.
We hide ourselves in the woods...
like rabbits...
Hunted.
We are looking for Partisans.
What is the name of your otriad?
What is an otriad?
- It's an armed brigade.
We heard that the Russians
begin to reorganize.
Then we Bielski brigade.
You want to join?
The Russians are fighters.
- But you need a gun to join them.
They sabotage railroads and kill Germans.
You want to kill Germans?
Come with me. Unless your still
afraid to use that rifle.
Stay there!
We must get what we need
without killing.
You won't bring your family back.
- Blood for blood.
You've already had yours.
- And I can still see their faces.
"Vengeance is mine. " Who said that to you?
- Oh, this is God's work you're now doing, Zus?
No, only you can do that.
Take a few lives, spare a few others...
We should not become like them.
- No, but at least we can kill like them.
Are you coming with us or not?
It's coming!
Now we are really partisans.
To the Bielski Brigade!
- Cigarettes!
Get a rifle!
He's going the wrong way.
We can't just leave him.
- We have no choice, go!
They thought you would bring food.
Did the farmer stop you?
They had guns, dogs?
- No.
I don't understand.
If you save a life, you must
take responsibility for it.
Again, I have no idea
what you are talking about.
O yeah, I think you do.
And now your little brother is gone.
How did you get past Lazar?
- Who?
You worthless piece of shit!
Enough!
He was right by you, someone could have been killed!
- I said enough!
Get up!
He would be shot.
If we were real partisans, we should shoot you.
You fucking little fool!
He made a mistake!
Mistake? We cannot make mistakes, Tuvia.
- Like last night, Zus?
First they will torture Asael
and then they will hang him.
You are Tuvia Bielski?
Do you know me?
- We heard of you in Vielkno.
Vielkno? My sister is...
- My family is there.
The SS came without warning.
We'd be better off in the ghetto.
Here we are safe.
- Where I live we have a home.
No, here we have home.
- Do we?
We have no food!
- Tomorrow will be another mission.
Look what happened last time.
- That was a mistake, the mistake will not be made again.
How do you know?
We may be here for a long time,
so we have to prepare.
Better security, better at getting food...
- We don't have weapons, people are getting sick.
In any case, we all have to participate.
but we don't want to turn against each other.
We can not afford a revenge. Not now.
We can not afford to lose
friends as Jakov and Peretz.
Or Asael.
We cannot lose anyone.
We will map out where we have been.
So as not to visit the same farms too often, and
we will take only from those who can afford to give...
and we will leave those who
can't alone.
Our revenge is...
to live
The poorest farmer has more than enough...
- Quiet!
What I am saying is we are
no thieves or murderers.
We may be hunted like animals,
but we will not become animals.
We have all chosen this to live here
free like as human beings for as long as we can.
Every day of freedom,
is like an act of faith.
And if we should die,
trying to live...
then at least we die like human beings.
Thank God!
Come here.
Zus, I can't breathe.
Look what we found.
How did you get these?
It's alright.
Please, come.
It is good.
Give me that.
So, you've been busy.
- Shut up!
Hello. I'm Zus.
This is Bella and this is Chaya.
- Please, come on, you must be hungry.
And we fell into this horrible bog.
Chaya saved me, honestly, I can't swim at all.
Well, we'll have to teach you.
- We must have got lost a thousand times.
I was absolutely deciding to die. Tell
him, Chaya was it not the absolute worst?
And the farmer, a mister..
- Koscik.
He kept making the most vulgar jokes.
So you're trying to tell me that
all politics is meaningless?
In the west, a monster with a little mustache,
in the east, a monster with a large mustache.
This is all I need to know about politics.
- Your Messiah will have a mustache too and a full beard.
No, the Messiah is already in politics
and they're killing us.
You know what's killing me?
That's all your talking.
And Roosevelt,... he has no mustache.
We need to know what's going on in the villages. Where
the Germans are patroling, who the informants are.
Are you listening, Tony?
- Yes.
What is her name?
- Chaya.
What are you doing?
- You are going to talk to her.
I hardly know her.
- You spent three days in a cellar with her.
- How much more do you want to know?
- Melvin says that the Pidsnarksi granary is full...
but we still need two guns at least.
- Whose turn is it to go?
- Zus.
- Then you go with him.
Make sure he understands my orders.
Go! Talk to her.
- How are you?
- Good.
Leave half. He cannot go
to the Germans empty-handed.
Tuvia's orders.
- Halt! Who goes there?
- You know who goes there, Lazar. We go there.
You only say 'Who goes there?'
when you don't know who goes there.
Sorry, Zus.
Milk and eggs. Chaya? Our
brave men have brought us food.
You could make me blintzes...
I don't think we have been
properly introduced.
- Hello.
- Arkady Lubczanski.
You're Chaya?
- Yes.
You're getting along alright? Anything you need?
An extra blanket?
- No, thank you. I am fine.
- Something nice and soft?
No, it is alright...
Yeah, but I see that you
don't have a husband yet.
- Here?
- A forest husband.
All the other women have chosen already,
they haven't told you about this?
No, thank you for explaining it.
Descartes at least provided for
the subjective nature of experience...
Yes, you annoy me, therefore I exist.
Ben Zion.
New ones just arrived.
They're from Novagrudok.
Your wife? They say
she was killed last week.
I'm sorry.
Thank you for telling me.
Can I join you?
- Of course.
I never...
- You never what?
You get lonely out here?
I like the woods.
I get a little bit scared sometimes.
Tell me something, why is there
a rule against women having guns?
There aren't enough for the men.
- Women need guns too.
What for?
For protection.
Women have men for protection.
I want protection.
Men with guns!
Weapons and ammunition only!
Keep them moving!
Move! Come on, quickly!
Don't stop before you reach the field.
Tuvia Bielski, and the rest of you
can go free!
You're from Belorussia, pig! Why do you work
with the Germansagainst your own people?
For the same reason
you steal from the poor.
To survive!
The next one's to the head!
It'll be dark soon,
how will you find your way home then?
They will be back.
We will have to build a new camp.
Next time you can draw them a map.
- And what does that mean?
It means we should have
killed the fucking milkman.
The policy of diplomacy is shit.
Winter is coming and now
we have no shelter. Why?
Because you do not have the stomach to
to do what must be done.
Go! Move!
Where is he taking us?
My feet are going to fall off.
I need volunteers for a scouting party.
- So now we are partisans
- We will see.
- Here.
- Thank you.
If my friends at the new
Socialist Squad could see me now...
I haven't read a book in months.
- I don't read much.
You can ask Shamon.
- Which I did.
And yet you accept me as commander?
- Who else?
Can I make an observation?
- Please, observe away.
We need to be strong, yes, but...
But?
Other things are important too.
- Such as?
- Community.
Do you have ideas about a community?
A few.
More mouths to feed.
- And more young bodies to keep us warm.
Which one is Tuvia Bielski?
I'm Tuvia.
None of us knew if you really existed.
Excuse me, my name is Yitzchak Shulman.
- Welcome Yitzchak.
I come from Brandovice.
The ghetto has been liquidated.
The Germans warned that everyone
would be executed if anyone was missing.
So the council stopped us
from leaving, but...
every day more people were killed.
My parents.
- We will do what we can.
- Thank you.
- Thank you
- You're welcome.
Please, would you help my parents?
I saw you looking at me...
If you rescue them, I'll do everything for you.
Everything, please!
And what does it mean 'do what we can'?
We will send for everyone
who is left alive.
- And if there are hundreds, Tuvia?
- Then we will provide.
- And when the Germans follow these hundreds? What then?
- I won't let that happen.
- You won't let that happen?
- No, I will bring them out myself.
From the ghetto?
- Yes.
So, now you are Moses, huh?
Zus, go back to work, you're wasting time.
- I'm not the one who's wasting time, Tuvia.
I cannot have you questioning me,
in front of the others.
We're family, we have to stick together.
Why?
So we can die alongside these mabushem?
Don't call them that, the people they're Jews.
- Pretentious Jews.
Jews who stuck up their noses at us.
Jews who'd go out of their way to lock
their daughters away from our dirty hands.
You're nothing to them, Tuvia!
They only follow you because they are too weak
and afraid to fight for themselves.
And what about Bella?
Would she be with you
if this wasn't happening?
Don't.
- Is it love, Zus?
And anyone else who would rather fight than
waiting to be killed...
we're leaving to join
those who fight.
Are you coming?
We are not so naive to think
they will keep some of us.
But all Jews, it makes no sense.
They need us to work
in the factories, in the labor camps.
They're death camps.
We too have heard of such places,
but have you seen them yourself?
Can you tell me with absolute certainty...
that we won't just as likely die out there
with you in the woods with winter coming on?
Do you think we haven't all
considered running away?
For everyone who leaves,
they killed 20.
How can I sacrifice thousands,
for the sake of a few?
What is we take you all?
The old? The sick? How will we live?
- We will protect you.
We have made alliances with the Russian partisans.
- They're as bad as the Germans.
You are too young to
know the pogroms.
Our only weapon is time.
If I can buy more, we will have won.
You want time? Fine!
I'll give you time. A day,
a month, maybe even a year.
To live.
Your daughter Chaya she's with us.
Your husband is waiting for you
Rabbi, please.
- We are waiting for God.
I'm going!
I'll go.
Me too.
Please have your valuables out and ready.
Keep moving!
Come on, we're not going to bite you.
Mama! Papa!
How about you, Grandpa?
- I'm watchmaker.
Can you repair a gun?
- The trigger.
- Maybe.
Alright, please come forward, everyone!
Have your things out and ready. Yes, please.
They were my grandmother.
- And now they belong to the otriad.
Everyone sacrifices
for the sake of the collective.
We can trade this
for food or weapons.
- Next!
- How about carpenters, any bootmakers? Seamstresses?
I am an accountant.
- Mm, that should come in handy...
You have a new profession.
- Mazzeltov.
Next.
I am a shoemaker.
- Good! You're welcome!
Yes, please.
- I am a nurse.
Good, you are most welcome.
Friends, this is the
happiest day of my life.
To see you here safely amongst us.
But there are a few things
you must learn about living here.
When you are rested and settled,
you will be assigned work duties.
Everyone will work,
there are no exceptions.
We will help supply our Russian
partisan comrades.
We will mend clothes,
we will repair weapons.
Women learn to shoot,
and they will fight alongside men.
Pregnancies are forbidden
We cannot accommodate an infant's needs here.
Today...
we will start rebuilding the lives
you have all lost.
This is the one place in all of
Belarussia, where you can be free.
We welcome you
into our community.
- He is a Jew?
- Yes.
Reload!
This is not a gun. To you
it is Barkhov's spear.
It is Samson's jawbone.
It is Ehud's sword.
It is the slingshot young David used
to bring down the monster Goliath.
And we will become warriors,
like the Maccabees
and the Sicarii...
Brave men and women
fighting for their freedom.
As they were.
Fire!
Good.
This here, this is a knight.
He can move one two forward
and and one to the side...
Yesterday potatoes with beet,
Today beets with potatoes.
Tomorrow special treat,
potato soup.
Stop complaining, you
wenches, and keep mashing.
We love potatoes, don't we, boy?
- Yes, sir!
We love vodka, women.
Thank you.
Sit down!
Put some hairs on your chest.
If you want to be a soldier, you drink!
What are you doing?
- Asael, let's have him a little drink.
So, a little bird told me...
that a certain someone is waiting for another
certain someone to ask a certain question.
- Hello, Chaya.
- Hello Asael.
- Let me take...
- No.
I'm fine. Thank you.
Can I help you?
Chaya, I was wondering if maybe you...
I mean you and I...
I,... I, I accept.
- You do?
- I do.
Blessed art Thou, our god,
King of the universe.
Who created man in His
own image.
And out of Himself searched for us
a lasting place.
Blessed art Thou, our God,
King of the universe...
who created all things,
for His glory.
Oh gladden these loving mates...
as Thou did anciently gladden Thy creatures in Eden.
Blessed art Thou, O God...
who gladdens the bridegroom and the bride.
Amen.
- Amen.
With this ring you are consecrated to me
according to the law of Moses and Israel.
