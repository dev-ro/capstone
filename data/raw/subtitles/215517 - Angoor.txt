This is William Shakespeare.
He was a famous playwright
of the 16th century.
And is still considered
to be the greatest.
which he called
'Comedy of errors'.
Several writers have penned stories
revolving around twins...
but Shakespeare is the only one to
write a story based on 4 twins.
There are 2 sets of twins and
each has a servant and a master.
The story goes like this...
Why do you want to go by ship,
when we can go by plane?
- lt'll also be time consuming.
- Do you enjoy eating fruits?
Will you enjoy eating a vitamin pill
as much as you would eating the fruit?
- Certainly not.
- So, Enjoy the holidays to the utmost.
Do you want to know the truth...?
l can't swim.
So l'm scared to travel
by water.
Do you know something? l can't fly. And
so l am scared to travel by air.
- So, have we reached?
- Yes, sir.
There's still time for the
ferry, so we can rest for a while.
We will let the horses rest.
l'll give them some water.
- Listen...
- What is it?
Will we wait here for a while?
- Yes, let's wait here for a while.
Feed the children. They must be tired.
- All right.
They're kicking up a fuss.
- Oh yes.
Give me the younger Ashok.
- This is the elder one.
- lt's so difficult to tell them apart!
You've even given them same names.
When their features will change
we'll name them differently.
Send someone for the luggage.
- What's going on?
- l'd heard that ,...
that twins do everything at the same
time, but he's fed and is yet crying.
These are the children from
the 'Comedy of Errors'.
- You've fed him twice.
- l just now fed him.
- You didn't feed him.
- But you were holding him.
You've fed him twice so he will
cry out at this injustice.
- Now take care of him.
- Oh God!
There has been an injustice, sir!
- You too know about it?
What are you talking about, sir?
- What are you talking about?
An unfortunate lady has left her
twin boys at the temple steps.
A crowd has collected there but
nobody is ready to accept them.
They are worried about
the children's caste.
Can l say something, sir - Why don't
you adopt them? - What? Two more?
- And that too, twins?
- They'll serve your kids. Keep them.
- Where are they?
- ln the courtyard.
l brought them over, l couldn't
bear to leave them there.
- Let me take a look.
- Come.
- What injustice!
- They are so cute.
- Humanity is dead.
- They have such nice eyes.
- They look brave.
- Then, let's call them Bahadur.
- Call both the same?
- Your children too have same names.
Come on, let's take them home.
Please book two more seats on the
ship.
Brother-in-law, that is my
foot, not my sister's.
- So where is sister's foot?
- She's my sister, not yours.
- Sister, throw a card.
- Why are you sitting cross-legged?
l don't want your feet
hurting me.
Sister, you've let him win.
Come on, count your points.
Mine is nil. Yours, sister?
- Mine is 17 points.
- You've miscalculated. lt's 19.
- Okay.
- lt's your turn to deal.
Where is Bahadur?
He's taken the evening off
to watch a movie with his wife.
- So you've done the cooking?
- Do you think it's Bahadur who cooks?
- He goes for a film very often.
- lt's okay.
- He slogs like a donkey.
- But doesn't use his brains.
- Had he to work elsewhere,..
- He's not a servant.
He's brought you up.
lt is l who brought him up.
lt is our father who brought
both of you up.
Your father takes the
entire credit.
So, my father Raj Tilak
was of no consequence?
How are you so confident of
your father's name?
l've told you this several times.
Your manager,..
who saved us told me that
before dying father was alive.
Everyone is alive before dying.
After that incident, when the
manager brought us ashore,...
father was alive and died
a day after that.
He was unconscious and regained
consciousness for a while.
That's when he gave his
name and ours too.
- Do you follow?
- Yes, the cards.
Father confused your name with
Bahadur and vice versa.
ln which case, you'd
have married the donkey!
She would've still married you
irrespective of your name.
Really? Even if my name was
''Chirkoot Kumar''?
A name doesn't change a man's
personality.
True. Your father was a good
judge of character.
He knew that on growing up,..
l've got a joker!
- There it comes again.
- Who?
Two jacks and kings. l'm fed up
of these duplicates.
lt was a dark night.
There was an eerie silence...
Vijay quietly entered
the mansion.
An old clock hung in one
corner of the mansion.
lt's hand moved tick, tick, tick...
lt was One 0'clock in the morning.
To the right of the clock, was a
painting covered with cobwebs...
This was the picture of
Princess Neelam.
Her eyes had a sad look.
As if she was waiting for
Vijay since ages.
This set Vijay thinking.
The door opened at
that very moment.
Bullets started flying everywhere!
And one bullet grazed Vijay's arm.
Another bullet grazed his right ear.
Then everything was still.
A hand appeared out of nowhere....
- What happened?
- Murder!
- Whose, The hero's?
- No, Princess Neelam's.
The culprit is dangerous and
wears long sleeved shirts.
With cuffs like yours!
Keep this novel aside
before it harms us.
Mother also feels the same.
Now go to sleep.
lf you stay awake you won't be able
to work in the morning.
l'll switch off the lights.
What happened?
Did you see what's in the bathroom?
- There is a commode and mirror.
What if a gangster is hidden there
who will strike us at nightfall?
- All this is the result,..
- Talk softly!
All this is the result of these
detective books you keep reading.
- l'll check.
- Be careful. What if he attacks?
Go well prepared.
l'll show you...
Give yourself up...
else, l'll fire!
No...? l'll count till three.
Didn't l tell you?
l won't get scared.
l've read many....l mean l've faced many
such encounters. Open the door.
Did you have your
vitamin pill today?
l mean the bullet,
not the vitamin pill.
Open the door.
You won't...?
He fled.
Hold this.
- Why this whistle?
- A station must be close by. Come on.
''To my lips comes a song''
''lt's a night to fulfill promises''
''You do remember surely....''
''the honey, dripping
from the moon''
''lt's a night,...''
''a night to call
the Moon's bluff''
''You recollect
that rainy night surely...''
''that night of passions''
''lt is a night,...''
''to spend on the roof''
- Greetings, Sir!
- Greetings!
- Did you go somewhere?
- l am coming.
Only if you went out
could you be coming.
Do you have another profession
besides ticket collecting?
You seem quite street smart.
- Bahadur, your master is angry.
- That's his mood.
- Do you know me?
- l sent you that basket of mangoes.
l can't remember. Here are the tickets.
- What was the T.C. telling you?
- About a basket of mangoes.
- For whom?
- He was trying to get friendly.
l think he's part of a gang.
He got the information that
we're carrying lots of cash.
He was trying to dig out information.
The stiff upper-lip. Quiet then.
Porter, take this.
Thanks Mr Ashok, for getting my
brother-in-law a job.
- Whom?
- The younger one.
The elder one works for the income
tax and draws a decent salary.
- Really?
- Yes.
- l think he's from the gang too.
- Yes.
- l get it.
- l'll come home some day. Bye.
- Where do you have to go?
- Why should l tell you?
So where do l take you?
- We'll have to tell him!
- Do you know the lmperial Hotel?
- Yes, l do.
- Then first take us there.
We won't be staying there.
We've to go elsewhere from there.
Take all this away.
l don't want any breakfast today.
- How can you go without breakfast?
- l'll have it somewhere.
- Sure! At Alka's place.
- Don't mention her name.
lt is such a sweet name.
l've warned you against dragging
that poor girl's name into this...
Oh! That poor girl has gotten
lots of new jewellery.
And l am dying for a necklace for
the past three months.
l won't return home without
your necklace today, okay?
l'm visiting the jeweller every day.
Ask him if you don't believe me.
Why should l go and ask anybody?
You are just making excuses.
- But what l'm telling you today,...
- l don't believe anything you say.
You both are at it again.
You just don't waste any time, do you!
One of the signs of true love
is that you fight incessantly.
Love me? My foot!
He loves only Alka and you.
Look at her impudence.
Bahadur, won't you let me pass?
- You should be used to it by now.
- Even Prema is better off than me.
- Even she gets a new sari sometime.
- Look at that!
How much l have to bear for not
getting one piece of her jewellery.
lf l'm a true man l won't come home
without your necklace.
What childishness is this!
l've never come across a more
jealous woman than you in history.
lt is only brother-in-law who
tolerates your acid tongue.
You're also taking up for him.
l only asked for a mere necklace.
And he didn't even eat
his breakfast.
Don't worry, he'll eat somewhere.
He's not one to stay hungry.
You eat.
How can l eat if he won't eat.
You eat it.
- What?
- Wash these utensils.
What were you doing there?
- Madam was crying.
- So what were you doing there?
l too was crying.
l can't bear to see Madam crying.
You are worse than a child.
- What is it?
- These are one lakh Rupees...
l'm keeping this money in
the cupboard.
We'll make the payment once the
deal is finalised.
- Okay.
- Don't go anywhere.
l don't want to venture out
in this city of thugs.
That's right.
l've kept the money in the almirah.
And the empty bag here.
- Why?
- lf that gang is eyeing this bag,...
they'll steal this bag at the
first given opportunity.
But our money will be safe.
lt means you've laid the bait...
but have safeguarded yourself.
But still be alert.
And don't open the door to anybody.
- And don't get doped.
- l don't have any dope on me.
- Let me see your pockets.
- l don't have a pocket.
- ln the bag?
- l don't have a bag.
- lt is not in the bag either.
- Okay.
l'll return in an hour or two.
- l asked you not to open the door?
- But l opened it for you.
- How did you know it was me?
- Who else could come so soon?
lt could be anybody. Thieves rob a
bank in three and a half minutes.
- Should l demonstrate?
- Do it in a bank.
Now go and finish your work.
When l return, l'll knock
thrice with my finger nails.
And l'll sing a tune,
'Come, my beloved'.
Quiet! Go for your work.
Okay. Shut the door.
Sir, l'd promised to pay the guy
who polishes the diamonds for me.
And he's expected today.
Look, Mr Chedilal,
l don't know him.
l deal with you. Give me the
necklace and take your payment.
lt's fine by me but that
Ganeshilal,....
That is your problem.
l want the necklace by this evening.
Due to this l'm facing a
problem in my family.
lt's difficult by this evening, but
l'll try to give it by nine tonight.
Mr Mansoor is also here. He'd gone
to fetch a box for your necklace.
- We're working on your item only.
- But where is it?
That'll also be soon done.
- But where is it?
- lt is getting ready.
Once it is ready you won't even be
able to recognise it.
Once again your words have
done the trick.
l'll come at 9 in the night.
- To collect it.
- lt'll be done.
Mansoor, get to work.
As this is your first visit do
some sight seeing.
Since this is a new contract l wanted
to be sure before commencing it.
Now that you're convinced you
can return back to the city.
- Okay.
- You'll reach in an hour's time.
You'll get the bus from
the main road.
Mastana, see him to
the main road.
One can easily lose his way here.
lt took me time while coming.
lt is a very quiet place.
Come.
Why are you whistling?
ls it a signal?
l never carry more money on me.
- lt is very dangerous.
- Danger lurks everywhere.
The house and bank
both are unsafe.
- Why is the house unsafe?
- Robbers eye it.
- And the bank?
- The government eyes it.
That's right. That's why l don't
keep it in both the places.
You're doing a wise thing.
Nobody can be trusted.
- What if somebody robs you?
- l'm not scared.
Once l was attacked by
some goons.
My appearance is deceptive,
but l'm very strong.
- Come.
- Okay.
Here is the bus-stand.
May l leave now?
Wait till the bus comes.
There it is.
lt is taking its own
sweet time.
On nearing the bus-stand it
has increased its speed.
Slowly!
Don't you have radish?
- Sir, you are smoking?
- What are you doing here?
- l came to buy radish.
- Radish?
Madam wanted to make stuffed
radish pancakes.
Prema confided in me that madam
makes them to please you.
Fool, who is this Prema
and Madam?
Sir, Prema is my wife and
madam is your wife.
- Bahadur, you've taken dope again?
- Me or you?
- l've never before seen you smoking.
- You've never seen me smoking?!
l asked you not to leave the hotel
and you are buying radish!
What's wrong with you?
- The younger madam was right.
- Now who is she?
Your sister-in-law.
l'm still a bachelor.
- Aren't you married?
- No, and when did you marry?
Don't talk against my marriage.
l've married Prema legally.
Come to your senses, Bahadur!
Where is that money?
- What money?
- l didn't give you any money?
You once gave me Rs 10, and ever
since, l've been accounting for it.
Try to recollect that l gave you
Rs 1 lakh this morning.
Do you re-collect?
Why don't you try to recollect that
you're married and have a family?
And you've never given
me anything.
- Madam does give ,...
- To hell with your madam.
Tell me why did you leave
the hotel?
And where is the money
that l gave you?
Money...? No marriage,
no wife...
no sister-in-law...
Sir, you've gone mad.
He's gone mad.
Madam, you are doomed!
- Can l hire it?
- Yes.
- You?!
- Where do you have to go?
Yes, but l'm not staying there.
l just have some work there.
l know everything about everyone.
- How much?
- Rs 4.25.
''You can't escape my clutches...
one day, l'll get you''
Keys for room no 102.
Your keys are in the room.
- Did you see my servant going out?
- No.
- Did you see him coming in?
- No.
Then what do you do?
- You're inquiring for that gentleman?
- He's my servant.
He's in his room and has
ordered lunch.
Sir, this is the bill
of room no 1 16.
''Come, my beloved''
l recognised you immediately.
But l didn't open the door out
of fear that you'd shout.
- You are scared of my scolding?
- Yes, because you rarely do it.
True. When did you
reach the hotel?
l came in with you this morning.
- Where is the money?
- Which money?
- l did not give you any money?
- No.
- That money l left with you.
- That's in the almirah.
Nobody came here.
- Why are you angry on me?
- l'm pleased with you.
- Where are my cigarettes?
- Here.
You've never seen me smoking?
Nonsense. You smoke despite
my not approving of it.
So why did you tell me in the market
that you've never seen me smoking?
And that l'm on dope.
And what is your wife's name?
My wife?
When did l get married?
l am married and l've a
sister-in-law also
Sit down. l'll get you
a glass of cold water.
Did you have hash today?
- l didn't have any.
- Tell me the truth.
Very little.
But that is harmless.
lt is others who feel
the effects.
l'll never forget the way you behaved
with me at the market today.
When did l meet you at
the market?
- l didn't leave this place at all.
- So did l see your ghost?
Don't l recognise you
or am l blind?
- Look...
- l've had enough.
You were strolling the market under
the influence of dope.
You were buying radish to make
stuffed radish pancakes.
- What is this?
- Stuffed radish pancakes.
Hear that.
How did l know about it?
l had a harrowing time with
master today.
Not only his own, he was bent upon
calling off my marriage also.
- You won't believe this.
- What?
- The master has gone mad.
- What?!
- Have you ever seen him smoking?
- No.
- l saw him.
- Really.
- He was smoking.
- Tell madam about it.
- He even abused madam.
- Come on, tell madam everything.
But l can't tell her that he
abused her.
- What will she do if he deserts her?
- My foot!
Madam, listen to what Bahadur
has to say.
- What is he saying?
- Ask him.
- What is the matter, Bahadur?
- Sir has gone mad.
- What are you saying?
- This is the fact.
- l saw him smoking.
- So?
He even refused to
accept his marriage.
- So?
- He even said that he's a bachelor.
- So?
- lsn't this enough?
He must've said it in anger.
Did you bring the radish?
- No.
- Why?
He slapped me so hard that
l forgot everything.
l think he's staying
in a hotel.
Because he kept talking
about a hotel.
From his talk, l don't think
he'll come back home.
- Yes?
- Did you hear him?
- What is the matter, Bahadur?
- Sir has gone mad.
- What happened to him?
- He's smoking joints.
He was stoned and refused to
accept his marital status.
He didn't recognise Prema either.
He was mentioning
about some money.
And then he whispered to me
again about that money.
Tanu, what will happen now?
l didn't tell you, but he sometimes
get's such attacks at night.
He'd scream and ask me not to touch
him; that he'd leave the house.
And he'd say that he's
saddled with a mad girl.
- He said that for you.
- He shouldn't speak this way for father.
- Bahadur, where did you meet him?
- At the market.
- What was he doing there?
- He was smoking.
Was he going somewhere or
coming from somewhere?
l think he was waiting
to nab me.
l think he's a fool.
- Will he come to eat?
- Whom?
- Will he come for dinner?
- l don't think so.
Your necklace is responsible
for all this.
The way he left l don't think he'll
return without the necklace.
Then why doesn't he return
with the necklace?
He has to come or my program
will be ruined.
- Right.
- Bahadur, come.
You cry so much that your eyes
don't need medication to clean them.
The cup has more tears
than medicine.
Go to Alka's place.
l'm sure he must be there.
- He's not going to skip a meal.
- What if he's not there?
Then after 3, go to the office.
And if he's not even there go to
the goldsmith Chedilal's shop.
- But he'll make mincemeat of me.
- He won't do anything.
Sister will cry herself to death.
Will you like that?
- l can give my life for her.
- Even this brother-in-law will do that.
Now listen to me carefully.
l'm getting late for my rehearsals.
Don't come home without him.
l assure you that l'll bring
him with me. l swear it on God.
- Now go.
- Okay.
- Won't you have lunch?
- l will, but l won't go home.
- Will you send for lunch?
- No, l'll eat at Alka's.
lt is already lunch time.
- Why're you replacing the receiver?
- There might be a call, sir.
l know and that's why l've
kept it engaged.
But Sir,...
l'm expecting a call.
- Are you married?
- No, Sir.
Don't ever get married!
Coming.
- Where is Madam?
- ln the shower.
- Where?
- ln the bathroom, where else?
- Ramu, who is it?
- Bahadur is here.
- Send him in.
- Go on.
- Where?
- To the bathroom.
- Greetings!
- Where is your master?
- l came here for him.
- Didn't he go to the office?
He left after a fight and then
l met him in the market.
- He slapped me and was smoking.
- Ashok was smoking?!
- Yes. The master has gone mad.
- Shut up! You talk nonsense.
lf you happen to meet him ask him
to meet me before he goes home.
- He won't go home today.
- Why not?
He had a fight with madam
for the necklace.
Then he must be at the goldsmith's.
Go and meet him there.
Mr Ganeshilal, l can't
pay you in cash.
l spoke to Mr Ashok and he'll pay
on delivery of the necklace.
And Mr Ashok has a good reputation.
ln business we don't
know anybody.
- We know him and yet don't know.
- So you don't know Mr Ashok?
l do know him but
yet l don't know him.
lf we make friends we'll
have to give them credit.
And l believe in cash.
Mine is a paltry amount.
l'll talk to him and in
a day or two...
- One day or two?
- Come tomorrow.
Here are your diamonds.
- So it's settled for tomorrow?
- Yes.
- What time?
- Around 1 1 or 12.
- 1 1 or 12 ?
- Come at 1 1 . Goodbye!
- Did my Master come here?
- He did come here in the morning.
- Why?
- That necklace is a nuisance.
- Where will he be now?
- l don't know.
But he'll come at 9 p.m. as l've
promised to give him the necklace.
- When did he come in the morning?
- Around 10.
- Was he smoking?
- l did not notice.
But l saw him smoking.
- lt was filled with hash.
- What are you saying?
- Sir has gone mad.
- For whom?
Who's driven him crazy that
he's getting a necklace made?
- He's making it for Madam.
- Forget it.
- Nobody does that.
- l meant his wife.
l don't think so.
Does he have a sister-in-law?
He's incorrigible.
Neither sister nor
brother-in-law has come.
Don't worry, l'll get them
seats when they come.
l'm very nervous. l'll leave if
there is a problem.
- l don't have any performance after this.
- We'll see that later, now go.
The song is in this book.
''Every day, on the branch...''
''what does the bee write?''
''He leaves a message for
the tender buds''
Sit here.
- Your seats are up ahead.
- But he made us sit here.
Come with me.
And where is your wife?
- She's not there.
- You are disturbing us.
- Go elsewhere.
- Okay.
''Memories remain''
''Of some tender moments of yore''
''Some nostalgic moments
must be there''
''There must be some promises...''
''to be fulfilled''
''Which must be a reminder''
''The memory must be alive''
Ms Tanu has called you
in the make-up room.
- The one who was singing?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Only she or you would know that.
Perhaps she wants a reward
or something.
But nobody else has
given anything.
Here, take this.
Give her this Rs 10 and tell her
that we enjoyed the song very much.
Don't you have change?
Bring Rs 5 back.
Don't do that.
That is not etiquette.
- Keep the entire amount.
- What are you saying?
l think you both have
had a fight.
You stay out of it.
Have you kept the money safely?
l'm scared of the gang.
- Don't worry.
- l'll get some pop-corn.
- Won't you have tea?
- No, you go ahead.
Give me a cup of tea.
- What happened?
- Bahadur was right.
- This is your latest fancy.
- Why did you throw my cigarette?
- Take dope at home.
- Are you in your senses?
l think it is you who
are stoned.
Brother-in-law, you should be
ashamed to talk to me in this vein.
When did l become your
brother-in-law?
Since the day you married
my sister.
Look at that!
This is too much.
- Madam, l am not married.
- So, Bahadur was right.
- How do you know Bahadur?
- Don't you know?
- l know but how do you know him?
- l'll tell you that later.
- What is this you are doing?
- Don't argue and come home.
Leave my hand and stop
molesting me.
Aren't you ashamed to make
a scene?
- Better you go home with Tanu.
- You too?
You somehow found out my name and
are now harassing me.
This is very embarrassing.
l didn't want to interfere as
this was a family matter.
But you are going too far.
lt is better if you settle your
family matters at home.
The relationship that she is
trying to form with me...
lf a sister-in-law forms a relation
with her brother-in-law...
Shut up! Don't talk without
knowing the facts.
As he's not favouring you,
you want him to keep shut.
This inspector is your accomplice,
so...
Quietly go home or l'll take you
to the police station.
l'll personally escort you.
Come, Tanu.
- You want to go to her house?
- Are you coming home or...?
- l am coming, but..
- But, what?
- Let Bahadur come.
- He'll come on his own.
- l can't drive a jeep.
- l'll drive it, you just get in.
- Can l hire this cab?
- Yes.
- Come.
- To lmperial hotel?
- No, follow that jeep.
- Get in.
Had you not been Gangaprasad's son-
in-law, l'd have arrested you at once.
Damn your Gangaprasad!
l understand everything.
You all are part of a gang.
Damn your brother-in-law!
She's also part of the gang.
l won't spare you, Sinha.
Let me get released and then
l'll get even with you.
- Did you have a fight?
- No Sudha, he's just in a bad mood.
Take care of him.
Forget the morning incident. l
promise l won't make any demands.
- Did you bring the necklace?
- Necklace?
- Forget l asked.
- Sister, watch out.
He's getting violent. So take
him to the bed-room.
- Why the bed-room?
- Why be scared to go with your wife?
- Please come.
- Listen to me.
Let's go upstairs and l'll be
an attentive listener.
He hasn't come back since he went
in the afternoon looking for Master.
He must be on his way. They both
have really harassed us today.
Like brother-in-law,
he too has gone mad.
He's behaving as if he
doesn't recognise me.
While l was singing he was
staring as if...
- ls this the place?
- Yes.
He was sitting next to brother-in-law
and munching popcorn.
- l'll teach him a lesson.
- l'll make him understand.
He was upset since morning.
l wonder if he's eaten anything also.
Come, my beloved!
Look at their antics. Have you ever
heard him singing in this tone?
- l'll teach him a lesson.
- No, l'll make him understand.
- Where were you for so long?
- ls Master...?
- Come in.
- Has Ashok sir come here?
Look at yourself.
Have you eaten anything?
l have.
Has Ashok sir come here?
Since when did you start addressing
master by his first name?
l usually don't but
thought that perhaps...
Don't be so formal with me.
Now come. l wonder where you
have been wandering since morning.
Master has gone upstairs and
will now demand for...
With your permission,
can l...
Bahadur, don't get smart with
me and come here.
Come.
Grind the spices.
Sit down!
Now the demand for
snacks will come.
Come on, start grinding
the paste.
- What are you making?
- Some onion and egg-plant fries.
- But Sir doesn't eat egg-plant.
- What?!
ln fact, he loves egg-plant.
- l meant...
- Do as l tell you.
- Okay, l'll do as you want me to.
- You're being formal again.
- Try to understand.
- That's better.
- One has to put on pretenses.
- What?
Sometimes.
What must he be doing upstairs?
- Drink this.
- l don't drink. l don't touch it.
Every day l stop you from drinking
and today when l'm....
- What are you talking about?
- Now drink this.
Drink it up.
- Don't be very angry.
- Okay.
- Mollify him.
- Okay.
- l think he has really gone mad.
- What?
- Don't even mention the necklace.
- l'll never mention it ever again.
Lord, make him fit again.
You know he was being so
formal with me.
lf you cry, it'll anger him further.
Give in to all his demands.
- Your appendix is giving trouble?
- No.
- Please tell me.
- l'd tied the loincloth very tight.
- Then take it off.
- What are you saying?
- Don't be so formal.
- Aren't you ashamed to talk thus?
Why, don't you come
home and change?
Besides, l've seen you
without clothes.
- You've seen me naked!
- Don't say that.
- Then what should l say?
- Say without clothes.
You mean sans clothes?
Please drink this.
Look, l...
- can l go out for 2 minutes?
- l won't let you out of my sight.
- You love me very much?
- Yes.
Okay, tell me...
how many people live
in this house?
Five. And the sixth will
soon be coming.
Who?
- You mean you are...
- Not me.
- Your sister?
- l'll hit you.
Tanu is still unmarried.
- Then who could it be?
- Prema.
Didn't l tell you that Bahadur
will soon be a father.
What... ?
How can he become a father?
- Why, is he that?
- But, just now...
- l've come.
- You and here?
- l've got fries.
- You're becoming a father?
- That...
- That girl Prema...
Now don't trouble him.
Didn't you bring some chilli sauce?
- No.
- Okay, l'll get it.
Sir, don't eat these fries
as they are doped.
But how can you become
a father?
Feed fries to both these women
and make them unconscious.
But what relation do you
have with her?
When they both fall unconscious
sing out to me.
But l heard...
You handle it here while l'll
deal with downstairs.
- Who's downstairs?
- Prema.
- But she is pregnant.
- Talk softly.
Prema is pregnant and
you are the father...
Do as l tell you and let's
get out of here.
What if the menfolk of
these women return?
- She's coming.
- Where is the money?
- lt's safe.
- Okay.
But how come you're going
to be a father?
What are you both whispering?
- What were you telling Bahadur?
- l was just asking him...
- how many months she's pregnant?
- l think you both are in it together.
- You want the chilli sauce?
- Yes.
That's all.
Let me feed you.
- Thank God, you've softened.
- Then eat it.
- You too eat some.
- l'll eat after drinking.
l'll make you drink it.
Eat it. Take a sip.
Keep it aside.
You look very good
while eating.
l feel as if l'm eating.
After so long you are so
lovingly feeding me.
Too bad that you are not
keeping your commitment.
Six of my workers
are working on it.
l've to be careful as it is
a bejewelled necklace.
What are you doing here?
Did you go to see a film?
l looked for you everywhere
but without success.
Then he said that you'd be
coming here at 9 p.m.
So l went for a movie.
You've started seeing
a lot of movies.
lt's nice to see you using snuff.
Why did you smoke and
create a scene?
- Who created a scene?
- l saw a dream.
- What?
- That you were smoking...
and then started getting
violent.
And even refused to accept
your own marriage.
How l wish your dream
comes true!
Then l'd be so relaxed.
But you gave me a hard slap.
You'd have borne that but atleast
l wouldn't be out at this hour.
Let's go home now.
Madam's hungry since morning.
No way will l enter that
house without the necklace.
- What about poor Madam?
- Don't pity her.
All this is being done for
that poor woman.
How are you now?
Thanks to you,
l'm much better now.
l think more is to come as you
are yet being so formal.
Come and sit down.
- Fries?
- Eat.
- You too join me.
- How can l? l'm drinking.
So what?
- How is sister?
- l've set her right.
That was expected of you. But l was
unaware of your acting prowess.
lf you realise it,
then that is not acting.
Eat some fries.
Okay..... Tanu,
tell me.....
what would've happened had
l not attended the show?
l'd have seen how you wouldn't
have attended?
What if l hadn't come at all?
l was rehearsing for 2 months. How
could you've ditched me now?
Two months! Now l know.
No wonder everything is
so perfect.
This spying is going on
since a long time.
Now l get it. Take some.
And what if l wouldn't have
reached here?
l'd have got you arrested.
Don't underestimate me.
The police is also involved.
Then how can l underestimate you?
What has Prema mixed
in the fries?
- Gram flour.
- Besides that.
- Onions.
- Taste it and see.
- l'm stuffed.
- l'll go and check.
Wait! Why do you have to go downstairs?
This seems fine to me.
- Something is amiss.
- Sit, l'll taste it for you.
lt is perfect.
Forget that,
take this one.
- lsn't it delicious?
- lt is, but...
Being tasty is the bottom line.
Don't get into details.
Eat some more.
A flower is beautiful, is
beautiful! That's all.
- Who is this laughing?
- You are laughing.
l thought it was somebody else.
- Somebody again laughed?
- ls it?
- lt must be Prema.
- Prema?
- What's wrong with her?
- She too is high.
- You mean she's drunk?
- No, these fries.
She's just in good spirits.
Have one more of it.
Softly. lt'll create a problem
if those women overhear.
Why did you shut the door?
- How many fingers are these?
- Two.
Not yet... no.
Have more fries. Go on.
Bahadur, am l laughing a lot?
This is not unusual while
eating fries.
Laughter is the best medicine.
- You try one too.
- No, l don't want it.
- What is it?
- Let's go home.
- ls the necklace ready?
- lt'll take some more time.
We'll collect the necklace in the
morning. Now let's go home.
lt is 1 1 o'clock.
How much more time will it take?
Mr Ashok, can l make
a request?
lt does take time for the
polishing of the final product.
l'll deliver the necklace
first thing in the morning.
But by then, the arguments
will begin.
l promise to be there
before dawn.
Make her wear while she's
still sleeping.
Pleasures of youth become
a bane of old age.
Bahadur, come, let's go.
We simply wasted two hours.
- Look...
- You'll get it before even you awaken.
l tried to escape those taunts
but l wasn't so lucky.
They must've fallen
asleep by now.
Halt here.
- Bahadur, pay him off.
- l don't have any money on me.
- Here, take this.
- How much is the fare?
lt's me...
open the door.
Open the door!
l think it's the gangsters.
You call out.
O Lord, protect us!
- Look at these women!
- Perhaps they have fallen asleep.
All of them?
- But all the lights are on.
- That's right.
- l'll go from the back door.
- Okay.
She has deliberately done this.
We are surrounded by the gang.
What shall l do now?
Prema, open the door.
l think they are doing it
deliberately.
Every time l called out to Prema,
- Where did a dog come from?
- l don't know.
This is impossible.
Sudha knows l hate dogs.
- Could be that that's why...
- She won't dare to do that.
- But l myself heard it.
- Your ears must be ringing.
- Are your ears also ringing?
- l'll tackle this in the morning.
- Now, let's go.
- But that taxi's gone.
We'll find another one.
- Where will we go?
- To Alka's place.
- We'll first go to Chedilal.
- Why?
To ask him to deliver the
necklace at Alka's place.
Bahadur, don't eat more.
You do know its contents.
So listen to me and
don't eat anymore.
Bahadur, control yourself!
Don't listen to me.
Gorge on it.
Then eat and face the
consequences!
''Come, my beloved''
''How will l lead a life
so full of sorrows?''
''The night scares me''
''And the house seems deserted''
''When the winds blow...''
''it looks like a cane''
''How many lashes do l have to take?''
''Solitude speaks''
''As if it were churning something''
''lt scared me,...''
''as if someone is
lifting the veil''
''How can l save face?''
- You were fast asleep.
- So were you.
Let's flee since everyone
is fast asleep.
- What is this?
- Prema locked it up in the night.
- Where is the key?
- lt is tied with a black cord.
- But where is it kept?
- There.
- How will you remove it?
- What? The blouse?
- No, the key.
- You remove it.
You do it. After all
she's your wife.
How come you are going
to be a father?
- How can you believe it?
- Yeah.
But...
Go and remove the key.
- Go.
- Should l wake her and ask?
Okay!
But will she let you go then?
Anyway as she's your wife you
can stay put here.
lf you do that l'll wake up the
one who's upstairs.
- Okay, then l'll wake her up.
- No, l'll go.
Hurry up!
Fool, you are tearing at
her blouse.
- The key!
- Come on.
- We've got it.
- Let's go.
Sir, this city is very dicey.
- Let's go back.
- You are right.
Book our return tickets while l'll
go to the hotel and pack up.
- Listen, can l hire this?
- Yes.
Please sit while l'll go
and freshen up.
This is called coincidence.
- l was going to your house.
- Are you talking to me in Urdu?
- l don't follow chaste Urdu.
- You are too good!
l'm talking to you.
Here is your gift.
But l think you spent the night
wandering on the streets.
What you are talking is
beyond my comprehension.
Open the gift and you'll
understand everything.
- lsn't it befitting for your beloved?
- But l don't want it.
- Nor do l've a beloved
. - You do have a wife.
l don't even have a wife.
l don't want to buy it.
- Who's selling it?
- Then are you gifting it?
Perhaps you didn't recognise me.
l'm Chedilal's employee.
l was there when you
came yesterday.
l don't know any Chedilal.
Don't you recognise this necklace
that you'd placed an order for?
:03 Don't try to con me.
Take this and get lost.
Take it.
By god, we've worked
hard on it.
l understand that you had to
put up with a lot last night.
- How did you know about last night?
- From my experience.
- Were you present there?
- Why should l interfere?
- Then why are you doing so now?
- l am not.
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!
Look, take this with you.
l've fulfilled my boss's orders.
- You can talk to him. Goodbye!
- Listen to me.
Stop!
l'm not staying there.
Sir, you hired me and
then took another auto.
- Bahadur, what are you doing here?
- l came to book tickets.
The counter opens at 10.
Where do you have to go?
- Where sir's mood takes him.
- Your master's moods are super.
- He just abused me yesterday.
- lt happens sometimes.
- Remember the mango basket l sent?
- Yes, l do remember.
Hurry up and have your
breakfast.
And go home to change
while going to the office.
l've sent Bahadur to
bring my clothes.
- l'll go direct to office.
- Don't be so stubborn.
lf you won't go home Sudha
will be worried.
To hell with her! She's really
harassed me last night.
You are very stubborn.
Give me. Now go home and bring the
fresh pair to the office.
- Why?
- l'll sell it to buy utensils.
- Why?
- Fool! Now leave.
And take a rope with you.
Give it to Sudha and ask her to hang
herself from the nearest tree.
Ashok, why are you only talking
about committing suicide?
Now go and follow my
instructions.
But how can l say
this to Madam?
ln that case be prepared
to commit suicide.
- What will you tell her?
- To commit suicide.
- Ask her to hang herself
. - Okay.
- You should've sent the necklace.
- l'll put it on her dead body now.
Just as Jaymal garlanded
Krishna's dead body.
You are still like a kid.
Eat some fruits.
That Chedilal also went
back on his word.
- Greetings!
- Greetings!
- Welcome.
- l came before time.
l didn't want to give you
a chance to make excuses.
Goodbye!
You seem to be very punctual.
l stand by my word. l accept
payments the day l've been promised.
- Have you ever seen me being late?
- No.
Mansoor, did Mr Ashok mention
about the payment?
No, in fact he even refused
to accept the necklace.
He said he'd not placed
the order.
- Then?
- l left it with him.
l think his wife didn'
t let him in last night.
ls there a big age difference
between them?
What makes you all
laugh so much?
On something that Mansoor said.
- Mr Ashok, this is Mr Ganeshilal.
- Greetings!
l've got the diamonds cut
and polished from him.
- His amount totals to Rs 2000.
- And how much do l owe you?
lt is Rs 10,235.
- You've hiked the prices.
- lt's all due to lnflation!
And gold prices, like the whims
of women, are always rising.
Collect the payment from the
office. l'll be there.
- Give me the necklace.
- What?
Yeah, give me the necklace. l won't
run away with the necklace.
Sir, l gave you the necklace
early in the morning.
- When did you meet me?
- What are you saying?
l met you at the auto stand and
you were sitting in the auto.
What nonsense!
l'm coming from home.
- lt is only 5 minutes to 1 1 .
- Just a minute.
Mansoor, are you sure that you
gave him the necklace?
Sir, won't l recognise Mr Ashok?
lt was he who didn't recognise me
and l had to tell him my identity.
lncredible!
Don't l recognise you?
ln the last 15 years you've visited
my house and office several times.
- And you say l don't recognise you.
- l'm equally baffled.
How will l not recognise you?
We must keep friendship,....
and business separate.
Keep quiet and let them talk.
But that is not my fault.
You had promised to make my payment
at 1 1 and it is 2 minutes to 1 1 .
Ganeshilal, if the necklace is
not found we all had it then.
- Then you'll be left hanging.
- l won't leave without my money.
Even if l've to call
the police.
Then call the police. They'll
retrieve the necklace too.
- At sharp 1 1 ...
- What will you do at 1 1 ?
- l'll tell you.
- Go ahead.
The church's to the right & the clock
tower is to the left of the square.
Don't try to teach me.
l'm well versed with the city.
Next to the clock tower is the
auto rickshaw stand.
And it gives day and
night service.
- This stand...
- Damn your auto stand!
- Tell me about the necklace.
- There was this auto...
which was facing the
clock tower.
You were in the auto and l placed
the necklace on your knees.
- Where did you place the necklace?
- On your knees.
l'm sure you've made a mistake.
l was talking in Urdu.
And what is Ashok
called in Urdu?
- Ashok?
- Yes.
- Tell him.
- How's Ashok involved with that?
Look at that! l've no concern
with the necklace!
Mansoor, who else will be
concerned about the necklace?
- What am l saying?
- That's what l too am wondering.
- Yeah.
- What about the necklace?
And my money and Ganeshilal's?
Where did he go?
Come. lt is already 1 1 .
- You look fine today?
- Thanks to you.
- You should thank your family.
- Meaning what?
Do you remember your state
last night?
- So you got the news?
- l was present there.
Were you working in that part of town?
- Such things do happen.
- Anyway, what is this new problem?
l'd placed an order for
a necklace...
Which l delivered to him
in the morning.
- You are lying.
- Don't talk like this.
- Then how should l talk?
- That is your problem.
But when l met you in the morning
you looked different.
You refused to recognise me and
even didn't acknowledge your wife.
So did l make that necklace
for Mr Sinha?
Ashok, there's no point
in arguing.
- Did you meet him in the morning?
- No.
- Did he give you the necklace?
- No!
- Did you tell him you're unmarried?
- How can l say that?
You had said that last night
also when l dropped you home.
When did l meet you last night
and when did you drop me home?
Ashok, l think you are stressed.
- Come with me.
- Where?
- To the police station.
- Why?
l'm not arresting you.
We'll go there and have a chat.
- lsn't it, Mr Chedilal?
- Yes.
- But it is already past 1 1 .
- You too come along.
- How much for this rope?
- What do you need it for?
- To commit suicide.
- l'll give you another one.
This is cheap and strong and
is most commonly used.
- How much does it cost?
- Rs 2.
- Give me for Re 1 .50
- Look elsewhere.
He wants to save money
even while dying.
Listen, come here.
Tell me, what will a man do by saving
money when he's dying?
- What do you mean?
- This rope costs Rs 2.
lf you've to commit suicide, how
does the price matter to you?
- Yeah, it shouldn't.
- So why're you saving 50 paise?
What will l do with the money
when l'm no more?
- Okay, give me Rs 1 .50.
- For what?
- For this rope.
- What will l do with it?
- Don't you want to commit suicide?
- Have you gone mad?
Here. Eat these peanuts.
This is also empty.
- Can l hire the cab?
- Yes.
- You want to go to lmperial hotel?
- l just asked.
- You're going to the police station?
- Why?
- Your master has gone there?
- What for?
l don't know but he was
accompanied by the inspector...
whom he met at the theater
last night.
Oh God!
- Take me to the police station.
- Get in.
Don't you utter a word more.
Or l'll put you in the lock-up.
Ashok, we'll surely find the
necklace. We'll go by your idea.
Keep Rs 5000 as surety and ask
at home if they've got the necklace.
Come in.
- What are you doing here?
- Good you came.
- Did you go home?
- No.
While l was returning after getting
the ticket, he told....
- l'd asked you to bring a rope.
- What rope?
l don't know what you are upto.
Just a minute.
Give me a piece of paper.
Give this letter to Tanu.
Let me finish. Tell her that
there is Rs 5000 in the drawer.
- And to give it to you.
- Did you leave all the money there?
Yes.
But will they let me go if
l again go there?
l've written everything in
this letter.
- Okay.
- Give this letter,...
and ask if anybody has
delivered a gold necklace.
Are you making a mistake or
in the night...
There's no need to repeat
the night's incident.
Now go and ask about
the necklace.
- But when did we buy the necklace?
- That's what l too am saying.
But they are unnecessarily
creating trouble.
- l had a premonition last night.
- Don't mention about the night.
l was sure something
would happen.
l'll sort out eveything.
Just go and do this work.
- Did you find your master?
- He's in.
- Have they arrested him?
- No, he's out but in.
- Where do you have to go?
- You remember that house?
- At night?
- Yes, l've to go there.
l know brother-in-law's stubborn
but l didn't expect him to go so far.
l'm sure Bahadur had mixed
something with the fries.
- But how could he dare?
- Bahadur must be helpless.
That's the reason both
are missing.
l got a doubt last night itself
that they want to go out.
So l asked Prema to lock the
door and hide the key.
Prema says that she'd kept
the key in her blouse.
And only Bahadur can
remove it from there.
lt's been 2 hours since
Prema left.
l wonder if she met them
at Alka's place.
- One of them is here.
- Where is he?
- Where is your master?
- He's sent this letter...
and asked if anyone's delivered
any gold necklace.
Your necklace is responsible
for this chaos.
He's asked for Rs 5000.
- Bahadur, can l ask you something?
- Yes.
- Give me an honest reply.
- Yes.
l'll not scream at you.
What did you mix with the fries?
- Dope.
- You rogue, scoundrel!
- But you assured you won't scream.
- What did l say?
ls he at Alka's house?
- No.
- Then where is he?
- At the police station.
- What is he doing there?
l don't know. He gave me this
letter and asked to bring the money.
- Bahadur, take this.
- And did you get the necklace?
No and give him this letter.
l wonder what's he doing in
the police station.
- Why is he there?
- Bahadur said he's there.
There's some problem as he asked
for the money and the necklace too.
Get ready and we'll go to
the police station.
- Why?
- Get up atleast.
Sister, come on, get up.
- ls there a police station nearby?
- Which one?
- What does that mean?
- There are two.
One is smaller and the other
is big. Which do you want?
l don't plan to buy it just want
to lodge a complaint.
Then you go to the
smaller one.
- But where is it?
- The auto will take you there.
- But why do you want to go?
- Since l've come...
l've encountered one problem
after the other.
A passer-by gave this to me.
Bahadur has gone to book the ticket
but hasn't returned as yet.
Anyway, what is the name
of the road?
After you go out, take right,
take a left from the turning...
after a distance you'll
find a temple.
Turn right and you'll find
a clock tower.
Turn left and you'll come
across a huge tree.
- Then..
- Turn right.
You got it right.
- Do you know where's Dominic road?
- Yes.
Go straight and turn right
from the turning.
After a distance you'll come
across a temple.
Turn left from there and you'll
come across a clock tower.
- Will you take me there?
- Yes.
- Come.
- Fine.
- You fool, come here.
- What happened at the police station?
l was going to lodge a complaint.
l was in-fact, worried for you.
and the younger lady gave me
this letter.
- Who's this younger madam?
- The one you were with that night.
Just you come home,
l'll complain to mother.
ls this decency?
There is a limit to everything.
lf you won't return immediately,
l'll get the police to bring you.
- You again went to that house?
- You only sent me there.
- l asked you to book the ticket.
- After booking the ticket...
you told me that you'd sent
me to buy a rope.
- Did l plan to hang it with?
- How do l know that?
- You've driven me crazy.
- And you, me.
l tell you to do something
and you do the reverse.
Sir, let's leave immediately.
l've booked the tickets and the
train leaves at 2 o' clock.
This place's inauspicious. So we're
landing in one or the other trouble.
- What do l do with this?
- What is this?
- lt is a gold necklace.
- So you did invite trouble.
- And you said...
- l refused it, but he forced it on me.
Now forget all that and
let's leave.
Perhaps the police is looking for
us and we meet them head on.
Bahadur, today for the first time
you've spoken sensibly.
The letter also says that
they'll get us arrested.
Get into the auto.
l'll go by the cab and
you take the auto.
- How much?
- Listen...
- Why do we need both of them?
- Right.
Panic is making us senseless.
Keep this.
Mr Sinha, if you permit me, l'll go
personally and bring the money.
- l wonder where Bahadur is.
- Sit down!
- l'll break your legs if you move.
- Can't a person even move?
Ashok, you can go but
come back soon.
l'll be back soon.
- How are you feeling?
- l am fine.
- Why?
- You look fine to me too.
- So?
- Go and come back soon.
He is here.
- Where is brother-in-law?
- Sir has sent this rope.
And l can't repeat what
he's told me.
- What did he say?
- l can never repeat that.
- Why's brother-in-law with the police?
- Whose brother-in-law?
What is he doing at the
police station?
- Why did he go there?
- You only told me that.
When did l say that?
l left him at Alka's house.
- You said he never went there.
- When did l say that?
l was sure he's made that
necklace also for her!
and the money was also
for her.
- Did you load the luggage?
- Yes.
Greetings, sir!
Get in.
Halt!
- Who are you? - Where are you going?
To my house at Dinkapur.
Do you have any objection?
- How are you talking?
- Bluntly. What will you do?
Are you all right? And you still
have this necklace with you?
- Go give it to Sudha.
- She knows about the necklace.
She also knows who it is for.
You are also a member of
that gang.
What did you do with the
Rs 5000 Tanu gave you?
Yesterday sir was mentioning a lakh
and today you are mentioning Rs 5000.
l'd given you a letter and asked you to
bring the money. What happened to that?
What letter?
We'll go home and find out.
lnspector, look, they are
going with all luggage.
You've been talking nonsense
since yesterday.
What happened to that money?
l think yesterday you had
gone mad and today l.
- Wait!
- lnspector, my train is due.
- So l can't wait.
- Are you leaving the town?
l'm going home and l
also have the tickets.
What about the necklace
and the money?
A lady took that necklace saying
it belonged to some Sudha.
- Sudha is your wife.
- She too said the same.
Have you come to your senses?
Why are you troubling Bahadur?
Ashok, you've gone mad.
- His state is similar to mine.
- See, what's happened to him?
l think he's lost his memory.
l'm at my wit's end. l met Ashok
now outside lmperial hotel.
- He was very rude.
- When did l meet you?
Since l left your house l was
in the police station.
- Then who gave me this necklace?
- How do l know?
- But how did you get this necklace?
- Now stop putting a facade.
Give it to her as it
was meant for her.
Sudha, this was for you.
Take it.
You keep it as it was for you.
Don't say such things.
Both were very upset last night.
lt was we who were upset.
We brought them home forcibly
but they doped us and escaped.
- Who doped you?
- You.
- l?
- Bahadur, speak the truth.
Didn't you mix dope with
the fries?
But we didn't come home
last night?
- Why are you lying?
- They were at my place last night.
- l brought him from the theater.
- Whom did you bring?
- l never went there.
- And who fed me the doped fries?
Who said that you feel
satiated when l eat?
But l didn't come home.
Ask Bahadur!
- Tell her!
- Dogs were barking in the house.
We both heard it.
Who removed the key from
Prema's blouse?
And who opened the door?
l'll show you the lock.
lsn't this the same lock?
And it is locked.
lt means the key is still with you.
Come on, get in.
l'm not ashamed of you.
As if l've never seen you
without clothes.
What?
You've seen me naked?
- Are you Mr Raj Tilak's son?
- Yes. You too?
- Yes.
- Are you also Ashok?
- Yes.
- Me too.
- ls he Bahadur, your servant?
- Yes.
Mine too.
Do you have a mole on your
right shoulder?
- No.
- Are you my twin brother?
- Yes.
- You are also Bahadur?
- And she is my wife.
l know. Sister-in-law,
did you recognise me?
You ate those doped fries?
l'm not supposed to eat.
She is your sister-in-law.
- Don't touch me.
- Why? What have l done?
- lnfact you said that you've...
- Shut up!
Did anything happen
last night?
l was just saved. What if
something would've happened?
Sudha, listen....
Mr Sinha, now do you realise
what's going on?
- Yes.
- Everyone, have tea and then leave.
l wanted to know about
the necklace.
The necklace has been found.
- But you promised for 1 1 .
- Come in at least.
- We'll let you go before 1 1 .
- Now forget all that.
l am Alka.
l know you are not my
brother-in-law.
- You are right.
- Why did you kiss me last night?
Brother, sister-in-law, welcome!
Brother, she is Kashibai, the cook.
Mother is inside. Come.
- l didn't recognise her.
- Can't even recognise your mother!
As there are pairs of everything, l
hope there aren't two mothers as well.
l'm very scared.
God bless you!
- Mother, she is sister-in-law.
- God bless you!
Greetings, mother!
What a strange coincidence!
