Searching for wanderer conversions
The Devil in the Basket 2
Last night, something happened in Times Square.
extremely bizarre but at the same time very unfortunate tragedy
A young man tragically fell from the third floor of the Breslin Hotel
The incident may be accidental or man-made
But the strange thing is that...
This young man's well did not fall alone
According to eyewitnesses, the fall was followed by an
ugly little deformed man
This creature was also described as a creature of unknown
A fleshy creature of unknown origin
Oh, my God! Probably all the channels are talking about this
A recent report says
This strange little thing is most likely human.
This little twisted and very scary
The deformed man is in fact a gripping human face
This face is very similar to the man who fell with him
The man who fell into the Brose Woods resembles
This man, identified as Duane Bradley
He is a native of the Greens area in upstate New York, USA.
A local spokesperson said
All relevant information will be made available to the public
It's them, isn't it?
Absolutely.
Details still need to be explored
According to an eyewitness testimony
The monster, if we can call it that.
Living in a very large picnic basket
And the victim keeps the blues with him all the time
Do you know the victim?
Duane is the best and kindest person I've ever met
It's a horrible thing.
You see that thing?
I saw it. I saw it very clearly.
Do you know what that is?
Yeah, that's his brother.
That little thing is Duane's own brother
You believe in this shit?
Based on information documented in upstate New York
Duane and his brother were born as Siamese twins
The smaller one, according to records, should
died in a secret separation operation
Let's go
We also have reason to believe that
Some of those victims happened to be
were the doctors who performed that separation surgery on them
Dr. Marks to the emergency room
Dr. Marks to the emergency room
Hi, handsome.
Hi, pretty girl, how are you?
How are those two key figures today?
Both of them are not good
Well, were you here?
I mean when the two of them were brought in.
No, I just came in an hour ago.
Oops, you missed it. It was like a circus.
There were cameras everywhere. It was crazy.
I think so.
That you want to go out and play after work
There is nothing to play with early in the morning
In fact, you can still think of something to do
You certainly can
Hi, I was just talking about breakfast.
I have things to do. I'll see you later.
Not bad
Quite good
Young man you still have a lot of hope
I'll be right back, okay?
I came in with permission.
The nurse at the front desk told me to come in
Good. Then we'll ask her first.
Well, let's talk to Dr. Brady. He says it's okay.
He said he'd give me five minutes to meet them.
I'm telling you are making a big mistake right now
Okay, we'll see about that!
I thought the reporters had gone
She must have followed those cops in.
I found her on the fourth floor.
I have the permission of the director of this hospital
Then let me see your ID!
They told me that everything would be arranged
I'll get a lot of cooperation from the whole staff
I only need to see them for 5 minutes
No one needs to know about it.
Just a handful of work, no big deal
Then let me see
I've helped you solve your problem
Yes you helped me solve my problem
All right?
No. No way.
This just makes me even more fucking pissed off
This kind of thing only makes me feel more disgusted with you
Very nasty. That's what you want.
You want to make me very angry!!!
I just want to stay with them for five minutes.
Miss, your attitude really fucking sucks.
You know what!
Duane Duane
Duane Bradley
Brian?
We are your friends.
I know your aunt. We can help you.
Please, get in the car before someone catches you.
Please, come here.
Do we go outside or just stay here?
No, don't take any chances.
I'll take care of their injuries myself. It's safer.
Where I am
He's awake.
You're safe now Duane.
You are with friends
Where is my brother?
He is also here
You're both fine.
What's going on?
Who are you
My name is Grover Brut
This is my granddaughter Soze
I can't
Don't you remember?
No, Bain must have hurt my head.
We have to get his leg back together.
And get my old x-ray machine out.
Where is his brother now?
In the nursery, he's very upset.
Confused, confused, confused.
I better go see him.
Your name is Brian, right?
I've never met your aunt again, but she called me after your
Dad called me after he died and asked me to help her
Did you know that
We've been in touch a lot.
She told me everything about you.
There are other children just like you.
Other children who are just as hurt
They need to be hidden
Protect them from the outside world
These other kids
They make this their home
So there you are!
Welcome But
But you're on my turf, you have to follow my rules.
That means you have to make a contribution.
Help each other to be part of our little home
Well, I know you're used to sleeping in the blue.
So we're ready, Suzy.
Now, I want you to meet the others.
Children Children
We have a new member
He's been through something really bad in the last few hours.
So, be nice to him.
If he wants to be alone
Then please, just leave him alone.
Come on, kids. Come on.
Let's cool off our newest addition
Let me introduce you to
This is Lanzum. He's from South Africa.
Born with a
supersized head and a stunted body
He was abandoned by his parents
Then it was displayed in an
illegal underground cheap exhibition
His voice is the best voice I've ever heard
Would you like to put on a show? Rantzum
(Song)
Now, come on over and meet Ellis.
No one knows her story.
She read my article and came to me herself.
She is like a second granddaughter to me
She is also an amazing poet
Hello Bran
This is Franklin.
I bought him from Franklin's parents.
Yes, I bought it.
I bought it at the open-air market
He was very, very, very introverted
It was hard to understand his thoughts
He was also the first to join
our family for help
There's another person here, and I'd like you to help her.
Someone who looks a lot like you
We don't know her name.
That's why we call her Eve.
She has been with us for about a year or so
It looks very painful, desperate and
In fact, we've all been through some pretty bad things
She seems to be overly immersed in her own little world
So she can't share our happiness.
And she can't care for each other
So maybe Brian maybe you can help her.
Take care of her and let her know she has friends too
Listen, I have a superb idea.
Related to your favorite subject matter
I know you'll like it.
It's annoying to listen to
A full page of the anniversary special issue
About your favorite pair of twins
Let's see how well we can play with this theme
I'd like you to review what we already know
And then write some new paragraphs out
They were born as Siamese twins
Then they were cut and merged
Killed some doctors
Then, he escaped from the hospital.
Don't remind me.
So where are they
I don't know. Maybe he's dead.
No, dead. That sounds terrible.
We need to keep them alive.
Lou, the only thing I found was
This story has been what can dig
If there are any clues, I will definitely go with it.
But, this story will be a big seller.
But there's nothing to dig up about this.
No clues, no news, no nothing
Then, write some conjectures, opinions and so on.
Interview some doctors ah ask the magician ah you know
Give me some assumptions
What if they went here?
What if they had gone over there?
How about your detective friend?
Phil, why did you mention him?
A few years ago, he wanted to create a character
We called Dr. Monster
Dr. Monster
Ruth Smuller
You weren't here then.
She showed us a boy with 11 arms
The boy died, but it turned her into
An evangelist who preaches for the rights of freaks
There's even a geek society set up
somewhere in the west.
So many wonderful stories were wasted
So she's still alive?
Go find out for yourself and find out to interview her!
But when you write this story
Don't forget to say how the twin fugitives ended up
And the newspaper's persistent efforts to find them for the sake of justice
blah blah blah
How much to give
All-inclusive fees
There are also heavy prizes!
If I find them, then I get the old O million.
1 million What 1 million?
Here we go, here we go, here we go.
Hello
Hello, you're that Melt, right?
Yes, yes, I am.
Hi, my name is Marcy Elliott, from Justice Daily.
I'm doing a story on the Bardai twins.
Oh, okay, okay.
I have... I have.
I have one of them here. Now, now.
What? Say it again.
I said I have the monster in the twins now.
He is a new product for my exhibition
I was just about to do some publicity.
So, listen, you're about 40 miles from Manhattan.
I can get there in about an hour.
Well, it's a little late now.
The exhibition is also closed
Look, I'll give you $100.
If I can see him tonight.
100 USD
Well, you have my address, right? Good! I'll wait for you.
Shit! 10O dollars!
100 dollars in hand!
Oh my God, $100!
Okay, okay, I'm coming.
This is a bad time. Come on, come on, come on. Hold on, come on.
Okay, I'm coming, I'm coming.
Is that Mr. Barker?
Yes, I am. How are you?
Horward Barker.
You made this ad, right?
Yes, it's mine.
But, we're closed now.
Yes, it's mine.
But we are now closed.
Oh, please.
Please, it took me a long time to get here.
The road is super jammed
Look, it'll only take a few minutes. You.
Can you? Please, please.
Well, I have to wait for someone to pass anyway
Let's just show you
You've definitely made the trip!
Give you a good look at my little darlings
They are my precious children
I love them. Look.
I turn on the light so you can see more clearly
I think they're beautiful. I love every one of them.
Come on in. I'll show you.
Ladies and gentlemen
Please look here. This is the mystery of nature.
A mysterious world full of new species
They may be born different, like this lady.
Or maybe they came from the mysterious outer space.
Just think of this little thing
One night I found it abandoned in the wild.
Or maybe they betrayed themselves
Crawled out from the bottom of hell
Just like this monster Bratev
This incredible creature
Through the hustle and bustle of sinful New York City
When he got here
He was holding a dead girl in one hand
In the other hand, he was holding a dead doctor
A local farmer shot him.
Boom! Do you know what they did?
They made a specimen of his body
Yes, specimens
But, this looks so big.
How can that basket possibly hold him?
Acromegaly Acromegaly
His branch ends are big
That means he will become bigger before he dies
Animal bones Chicken claws
The outer layer of lime
Simple styling
I noticed that you call them the mysteries of nature.
Yes, ma'am.
He you call those who casually expose the mysteries of nature
Trash, lowlife, asshole.
Hey, lady, why are you so excited?
It's you. You don't care if they're alive or dead.
or dead or even care if they're real!
You are incorrigible!
trash, lowlife, asshole!!!
I'm just trying to feed myself!!! Lady!
I don't care what those things are
As long as I have that $100!!!
Damn! Those women! Damn it!
I think you owe Mr. Brad E. an apology.
I owe you a fucking apology!
You heard what I said.
You two work it out. I'll wait in the car.
Impossible
Impossible! Definitely impossible!
Trash, lowlife, asshole.
Garbage, inferior people
Bastard, it's empty. It must be empty.
Mr. Barker
Anyone?
Mr. Barker!
When I was done throwing up, I called the police.
I'll talk to Frank later.
But where's the bottle?
Why don't you call me, Max?
I only had an hour.
I didn't know I'd see a dead body
But, baby, we're in this together.
Not this kind of together, let us do business.
You have superb leads
The devil stretches out his hand from the grave
Yes, the super monster ah
How about this for Buckle's tragic death at the hands of
The cold killing machine Brian the monster
Give the public a mysterious and advanced image
Rather than a very cheap feeling
Take a break
Good
And, no, not this one.
I got it.
UFO lands in the yard
Creature resembling Brian Bradley lands from spaceship
I took a look at the exhibition.
I think you can find the connection, understand?
Understood
Maybe
They are actually triplets
Perhaps they are in fact Siamese triplets.
Then the third wandering around to avenge the family
I'm going to Staten Island tomorrow night, do you want to go with me?
Staten Island I like it
Hi, how are you?
Tianpeng, you bought so much food.
You and your grandmother are the only two people who can eat
Do you want to invite me to dinner someday?
I just want to be friendly.
Perhaps if I were a monster
You might be a little more friendly
My grandmother is retired.
She has nothing to do with the freaks anymore
How about you? I keep asking you out for a drink.
You never talk to me. Is my house not good enough?
I made you margarita sprinkles and I put little umbrellas in your glasses.
I made you a salad and baked you a pie.
Have a great day!
Bitch
Relaxation
Relax and calm down.
Release your senses
Relaxation
Now let's pick up where we left off
Speaking of your forced separation from Boan's body
I get it!
We've discussed this man many times, but today
I want you to really face your feelings
Face your anger
I can understand
For you, it's not just the loss of a brother.
You also lose a part of yourself
You feel you are no longer complete
You want him, need him, and hate him at the same time.
I understand your sorrow I know your pain
But, smashing people's faces in
May not be your best hobby
Sorry
Hey, you're up early.
Did you sleep well last night?
It's good. It's good.
Does your foot still hurt?
Just a little bit in the ankle
But I won't complain anymore.
After how you and Grandma Ruth took care of me.
Then you can't repay such a great kindness
Thanks
You know, I may not have spent much time with them.
But I'm sure they all love you very much.
I love them more
I've never met anyone like you before
I have never met a person
Someone who cares about me and helps me like you do
Your brother is always with you, isn't he?
Uh, yes.
Yeah, but it's a little different now.
It's not Mom.
I mean, everything's changed.
He's happy here.
He has no reason to leave the area.
As long as he stays here
He won't need me. I'm finally completely free.
For the first time in my life, I can live my life completely.
Jump in the car and drive anywhere I want.
Drive away
Oh, my God, that would be so great. You and me leaving.
Here, to a new place, to do what we want to do.
Go wherever we want to go
But I will never leave here.
Neither will you.
We belong here
But why?
We're not like them.
I am
So are you. We always have been.
We're all the same, Duane.
Fuck you for thinking about it
I've been listening to those doctors for 12 years.
We are talking about your own flesh and blood
Flesh and blood? Duane is my flesh and blood.
Not that monster!
I just want Duane to live a normal life
It's too late to change the other one
Just free Duane from that thing and that's it
I don't know. I don't know.
The hospital said no. All the doctors I asked also said no.
You two may be my last hope
I don't know who you are.
I don't care where Leander found you.
There is no problem as long as they are separated from each other
And he was right.
That little boy does have the right to a normal life
Their bones and organs are not connected
Only the flesh is connected to the skin
If the separation surgery is successful
Duane will only have an unsightly scar at most
What about the other one?
Doctor, I'm not even sure that's a person.
Duane
That toy used to be one of my favorites
How are you doing?
Are you okay?
Of course it's fine I'm sure I'm fine
I live in a house full of freaks and freaks
And I still feel like he's connected to me to this day
Everything is great!
Duane, trust me.
I understand that this can be very confusing and painful for you
No, you don't.
How can you possibly understand
You don't understand at all
Duane, you're not the only one.
I have to forget the past
I must forget how I used to be
I have to... I have to...
I need to be alone for a while, okay?
No, no, no! Help! Help!
Damn it, don't struggle!
Get him into the living room. Don't struggle. Stop.
It won't hurt, Duane.
I promise you it won't hurt.
No don't don't save life save life
Don't move
Hold him down. If he keeps screaming like that.
If he keeps screaming, he can't move. Hold him down.
I'm not the same person I used to be
My brother is here
No, he's not here.
We've been over for a while. He's probably gone upstairs.
Okay, thanks.
Duane wait a minute
I know you don't like this.
But I wish I could talk to you for a while.
I'm worried about you.
I care about you.
Don't worry, I'll be out of here soon.
Really? Well, where would you go?
I don't know, I just don't belong here.
I mean I will always be grateful to you
Grateful for all that I have done
I just feel like I don't belong here.
You think you're not one of us
I used to think it was
But now I don't think so anymore
Does your brother know this?
That's what I'm going to talk to him about now
Brian?
Brian?
Are you here?
Brian
Elmo, how are you?
How are you doing?
Is my brother here?
Yes, he's here.
Over there in the far corner, with her.
Brian
I don't want to interrupt you
But, let's talk about
I don't know what to say.
I know you've been upset about something for the past few months
Because I can feel you trying to get into my head
But now everything is different
Everything has changed between me
I know you've been upset about something for months
Because I can feel you trying to get into my head
But now everything is different
Everything has changed between me
It changed from the moment we came to New York
I've always loved you, helped you.
For your sake I've been proving this to you
But what I owe you has been paid off between us.
I am no longer a part of you
I want to be free
I want to leave
I want to start my life over
I want a life without you
It's not that I've abandoned you
You've found your home here, and you've found someone you care about.
What
Who
Susan, what happened to her?
Yes, yes, I think I do love her.
And I think she loves me too. What's your problem?
Yes, because I want her to come with me.
She is more important to me
She is my hope, my key to a new life.
If she stays with me, I can say goodbye to the past.
Say goodbye to the old Duane Bradley
Start a new life
If she could stay by my side
Are you going in alone?
I need to talk to her. I don't want to scare her away.
Let me go in first.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You can't just let me sit here
So, look at the book.
(They're just like us, Ruth, by Smokey)
Oh my God.
Hello, I'm looking for Ruth Smuler.
It's amazing that you found this place.
Since you don't know my number
Then I happened to be in the neighborhood, so I just
We'll see you soon!
Yes, we met.
I respect you very much
I just want to interview your opinion
But, I despise you.
I despise everything you stand for.
It's those like you
people and the newspaper are sabotaging my efforts
Let those who are different
Can't get the respect and privacy they deserve
I feel that anything related to you
Anything is cheap and unbearable
I just want to ask a few questions about the Bradley brothers
Even if they're in the next room
I tell people like you
As far as I know, they are now at least
wanted for five murders.
It's just that as far as you know
I won't tell you anything.
I'm retired.
Now my patients are just a few old women in the neighborhood
I now have nothing to do with those special people
I think this visit can be over
Maybe next week, we can.
In the future, I don't want to hear from you or have any more interruptions from you.
There's nothing here that would interest you, Meserot.
Susan Susan
I have something to say to you
Michael
You scared us. Michael lives nearby.
He often runs errands for us.
Oh, yes, that's right.
I've brought what you asked for.
Here
Hello, Michael.
Oh, well, like I said earlier.
Thank you for your hospitality, and thank you for meeting me.
You're very welcome, but, I know you know.
Do you think she recognized me? I don't think she recognized me either.
She didn't say anything. She didn't look like she recognized me.
If she had recognized me, she would have said so, don't you think?
Do you think she recognized me?
How's that? Did you find it? How did you
Brandley's in there. He's in there.
What? Oh, my God, are you sure?
Then talk to me right there, right in front of me.
Oh my God! You found him!
You really found him!
What about the other one!
I didn't see it, but that Brady basket.
A big fucking basket
All of them... I'll be damned.
Let's go tell Ruth.
Don't you dare!
Think about it, you idiot. With this story.
We can earn much more than what Ruth paid us
How much more?
We can be in
People Magazine!
We can have a whole magazine interview!
And on TV. Movie rights!
This could be the beginning of our whole brilliant career
Now is the time!!! Douchebag
As long as we don't screw up
What's next!
Let me catch my breath first
I thought you told everyone at a glance
I thought they were with someone else.
It's not her fault.
We went to the garage and I forgot my back door key.
She recognized him!
Of course!
Must have recognized
I'll leave. I'll take Brian and leave.
I can go anywhere.
But they'll still keep coming here
When they all come back
they will find others
Oh my God.
They come here to find us
As a result they will find all the other people
Exactly right
I can't let this be happening
So what do you do?
It was me who had to do something
If I can't escape, then I'll stay here.
I will stay and fight
Seriously!!!
Yes
I owe you more than that.
Until you, Susan.
I won't leave until you and the others are safe.
This is what I want
Susan, call everyone to the meeting.
Let everyone be ready
Then we can fight for those days of the past
Children Children
Once again, the war will be fought in our homeland
A journalist from a gossip paper!
Want to expose one of us once again
If she does this
All of us are at risk of being exposed
There is a risk of destroying everything we have worked so hard to build
Those desperate days of the past
will come again
We have the right to protect our privacy
and live with dignity!!!
Our rights have been choked by those small open-air exhibitions
Once again!
The cold and hateful society outside
Society has to torture us again cruelly
We've been subjected to so many years of violence!
We either have to get out of here.
Find a new place to hide.
Or we fight ourselves!
Quiet, I know there are some of you out there.
For physiological reasons
Or psychological reasons for not being able to do so
We respect this．
I hope that all people will respect this
But the rest of the people
I implore you to answer
Do we run or do we fight?
Combat Combat Combat. Combat
If by now
Our reporter children still did not find the police to
That's because she so wants to find another
Most likely she is the one
Or someone who works with her
Is trying to get in here first
Someone is bound to find a way to sneak into our house.
So, I think
Let them in.
Let's welcome them with open arms
Then let's give them
A welcome party they will never forget
Tell me how to get in
No, I don't know how to get in.
Look! Look!
Do you think the Bradley brothers will be on that car?
No, I think we should go into that house first.
There must be other good things inside
It's your call. Remember.
Must shoot to Duane another big danger
You get a picture of Duane first
So that we can rely on this photo to get in tomorrow
I'll take care of him all tonight.
Do what I tell you to do!
Don't screw it up for me!
I am a professional, you can wait here.
Yes, he's sick.
Brian, Brian, you heard me!
Grandma went to buy you to go
I'll go down to the basement and get you a blanket or something.
What!
No
No, I told them.
I told him you couldn't move.
I couldn't have taken you to him
He said then wait until tomorrow
Wait a minute.
I feel like I heard something
I better check it out.
How are you doing?
Don't be afraid I won't hurt you
You're not feeling well right now.
So I just want you to relax
Just a few pictures, and then I'll be gone.
Here is very dark, so I will use the flash
Will be very bright flash
But do not feel uncomfortable because of this
Just relax and you'll be fine
Stand back and say cheese
I'll go
No! No!
No!
No!
Better be good; Shaw Rest
It's me, Mark Elliott.
I need your help.
I mean, there's a big problem.
Can't we wait until tomorrow?
I think Aldi has already been killed.
What do you mean when you say Aldi was killed?
Do you remember the sick twins in Times Square!
Yes
I found them.
It's at Ruth Smoller's house.
Dr. Monster
Yes
I have not heard this name for many years
The man who once proposed that those
freaks have equal rights to freedom
That's not funny.
Listen, I want Duane.
Before I went to the police
I need to talk to Duane.
to her house.
It was impossible to ask her directly for these two
You have to let Duane out on his own
Let him out.
Sit down
Then take him down.
Hello
Don't hang up or I'll make your little friend
Duane was surrounded by police within five minutes
Little bastard
Who are you now?
Let me talk to Duane.
There is no such person here.
Let me talk to him or I'll have the police knock on your door.
Wait a minute.
Find your
It's done.
Who
I am the one who knows about you
And about your brother.
Do you understand?
What do you want
I need to talk to you about Duane.
I want to talk to you face to face
Drinking beer and talking about life
Without your brother present, of course.
You are Duane Well
I bought you a beer.
Thank you
My name is Phil, and I'm looking forward to meeting you.
Do you work with that reporter?
Almost
We are old friends
But it's just the two of us tonight, okay?
What do you want?
Well, to kick things off
I'd like to know what happened to my other old friend
His name is Eddie.
He went into the house where you live now
and never came out again
He never came.
Oh, I think he did get in.
And I think he met your brother.
You're wasting my time.
Wait a minute.
Sit down
Sit down
Finish your beer!
Relaxation
Relax.
What exactly do you want from me?
I know where your brother is.
Why?
Because he kills people
Because he needs help.
Oh, you want to help him, do you?
You want to help the little monster!
You want to help the little geek.
I didn't call him that. I called him your brother.
This is him, but not well
But... he needs to help Duane.
He needs a lot of love and a lot of help
I can help him find people who really care about him
Give him what he needs
What if I told you he'd gotten these
What if I told you that he had gotten
all the help he needs?
Then I'll ask you how you're doing.
I
What's wrong with me!
No problem
That's your problem.
You've been living in the shadow of your brother
Everyone connects you to him
As long as you are still together
You're not a freak. You're no different from the rest of us.
You even look pretty fucking handsome.
I can't even imagine a girl rejecting a guy like you for
You can become a love affair killer
I can imagine all the people
You're some kind of monster, not a normal person.
Normal, normal people like us.
This... this is what I always wanted... me.
I just want people to think that I'm a normal person too.
I just want to be like everyone else, to fit in.
But you're just normal, Duane.
You are
You are as normal as I am
But it's not that simple.
I mean, when you say I'm normal, it's...
Because I look normal to you, Mom.
I look like everyone else.
I look just like everyone else
Duane, keep your voice down.
But in a house full of freaks
Things are different
In the monster house, you and I are the ones who are not normal.
Right!
Yes!
I'm talking about the real world Duane
Don't you want to become normal in this real world?
No. If that doesn't make sense.
I mean it's like here.
Do you look normal here with me?
We haven't integrated here since
Of course.
Maybe
But maybe not
Let's go out for a walk
Duane sit down, don't be stupid, maybe someone
Hell
Who are these people?
Oh my God.
No, no, no, no.
Sorry
Sorry
My family can listen to what I say
We want to take a poll
How many of you think that I and this
What did you say your name was again?
What the fuck is going on here?
And how many of you think that me and this
What the fuck is going on ah is normal
Raise your hand
No one?
No one?
None of them.
You see
Okay, so.
How many of you think we don't belong here
How many people think we are the freaks
You see, I think
It seems that this group of people do not agree with your point of view
No, no, no, no, no.
I don't want to get into any trouble here.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
Relax and calm down
Stay away from me.
Oh my God.
What do you want?
Come, children, come.
That's it. Decision Point
Frederic here
Frederic
That's it. That's it.
Frederick, look down, look down again.
Are you okay? I heard the gunshots.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
You searched his pockets
You searched his pockets
I found it
Miss Marcy Eilert
Unit 4, Terry Ace Building, 443 Bolsedes Avenue
This is it
Phil
Phil
Hello
Hello, I can't answer your phone right now.
If you leave your name and phone number, I will contact you as soon as possible.
Damn it! Phil, where the hell are you?
I'm worried sick.
Good evening!
What do you want? What are you doing here?
I thought you wanted to see me.
I thought you wanted to write a big story about us.
Not now, not tonight.
Oh, my God.
He'll be very disappointed. He was looking forward to this.
Phil, where is he? What have you done to Phil?
I mean, he's been waiting outside.
Very excited
He wants to die to see you ah
Who
Of course it's my brother
Brian
The little monster that you want to know everything about him
Oh my God.
I don't want to see him now, not tonight.
No, that's not how a journalist should behave.
He wants to meet you and do an interview.
A personal interview
His first life
He was very excited
He doesn't stay in the blue anymore
I let him out a long time ago.
He should be hiding somewhere, with his friends.
His friends
Yes, my friends, just like him.
Grandma Ruth's house is full of them
Too bad you missed it.
You really don't know who else is going to be there, do you?
I swear I won't report this.
I swear I won't tell anyone at all.
No one will ever know, I promise!
It's up to Brian to decide.
I mean, he's really looking forward to
the interview with you
He thinks you can ask him some questions
Then you can get to know him better
Then he can rip your face off
Nothing major
Hi, you're back.
All right, you son of a bitch.
Your brother wants to meet me, so let's meet.
I'm not afraid of you or him
Or any of you
Come on!
Let him come to me!
So that I can brake his disgusting perverted body
Where is he!
Where is he!
Gosh, I didn't know he was here just a few minutes ago.
Maybe you got him to stop being angry.
Maybe the disgusting things you just said scared him
Maybe he was afraid of you and then hid.
Maybe
Hi
What's in the blue
Geez, Meloy, you should see yourself.
You're a monster now, too.
Kids, how are you doing here?
Is there enough to eat!
You need to hear this
Ryan, I saw you with the soda again.
I really like soda.
Listen there are many more over there
Want to eat something else?
Is it good?
I know you drank five more cans.
I'm so proud of them. Where are those two brothers?
I got Brian and Eve together.
She was upset that Brian was leaving, but I think
You know, it's the first time they've been alone together.
That's good. What about Duane!
I don't know where he is.
I'm worried about him, Grandma.
Me too
I'm going to add a sweater and then go see where he is.
There are a lot of them. Everyone can eat with confidence.
Eat whatever you want
Duane
What are you doing here?
I can't sleep. I need to talk to you.
I want to be with you
I just want you. I just need you.
Duane, I don't know, I
Let's get out of here, you and me.
Today Now Now
But I can't leave
I don't belong to the outside world
What are you talking about? You're no different from me.
You don't belong to the outside world either
We must not forget who we are
But, you're as normal as I am.
No, no, I'm not.
What's going on?
What's wrong with you?
Yes, it's Brian.
Something's going on. I can feel it.
I don't know. He... he...
He also fell in love
Duane, wait a minute.
There is something you should know
I used to be with a man
When I was very young
So what? I don't care.
But I never realized I had a problem.
And being with him made a problem even more problematic
It changes everything
It closed me off to introversion
Whatever that is, it doesn't matter. I love you, Susan.
I love you
Duane wait a minute
No, I can't.
I'm... I'm pregnant. I've been pregnant for six years.
What
We wanted to let him be born but he did not want to be born
So Grandma took care of me until he was willing to be born
What
Don't be afraid of him
He's not dangerous. He only comes out for air sometimes.
No, no.
Jesus, no.
Don't do this to me Duane
Oh my God, no!
No, don't do this, please, please.
Duane, stop, stop.
Look at me. Look at me.
Watch me
No!
Look at me
Look at me! Look at me.
I'm not a pervert, Duane.
Leave me alone
She wanted me. She told me.
She said she was one of them.
Say me too
Say we don't belong to the outside world
We said we can't pretend to be normal
Find Duane
This must be a joke to separate us
Doesn't make us two separate people
It's just two separated flesh
When we are cut apart
That doesn't make us two separate people
It just makes us two halves
But I know how to do it.
I know how to solve the problem
I know how to make things work.
I know how to solve the problem
Hey, can I talk to you for a few minutes?
What's that? You're having fun right now.
Are you in love? No.
No! No!
You're only half the man
Unless I'm happy, you can't be happy.
You can't fall in love until I do.
I don't think it matters what happened before
This is the only way to solve the problem
Hey, it's okay. We're back together.
Thanks for watching
