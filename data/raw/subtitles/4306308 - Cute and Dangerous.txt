  Zarok had set his mind
on a beautiful white horse.
He stole it and
started galloping at full speed.
But the bad guys were coming after him,
also on their horses.
While he was running from them,
Zarok suddenly fell from the horse.
-But the story doesn't begin like this.
-Yes, it doesn't.
The part before the horses is good too.
Tell that part as well.
Okay. I started from here because
that's where we left off last week.
Okay. Zelis looked at the mirror
and thought that...
...her birthmark represented the love of
her life, a prince from fairy tales.
-But that's not the beginning either!
-Yeah, the kids are right.
I was here
when you told it last week.
Zelis's father was waiting at the door,
holding a bucket.
And her mother was screaming inside,
giving birth.
Okay, okay!
As Mustafa rushed to the labor room
with a bucket of hot water...
Zarok!
Say "once upon a time".
Once upon a time...
I'm burning!
Hot! Hot!
I'm burning! Hot! Hot!
Hot!
-Stay outside.
Push, my dear. Push, Nurten.
Nurten, please, don't push too hard!
Remember what the doctor said?
You have a narrow channel
or a narrow canal or something.
If you push too hard,
the baby will come out like a flatbread.
God forbid, Nurten!
-To hell with your channels and canals!
Once you shut up, it'll come out!
Silly Mustafa!
Daddy's cutie pie, oh...
Isn't it born yet, mama?
It will be,
but that boy out there won't shut up!
Go make him shut up!
-Shut him up. Shut him up.
Is it born yet?
Mr. Hakki. She's not well.
We have to call a doctor.
Let her die. No doctor.
Just save the baby.
It's a girl!
We should have taken her
to the hospital, sir.
She didn't survive the bleeding.
We lost the child as well.
She didn't trust me.
She knew about her illness.
She knew she was unlikely to live
after the birth.
She left all her fortune to her kid.
And that's not it.
The money will only be transferred
when the child gets married.
If something happens to the child,...
...200 million dollars, this house,
everything will be donated for charity.
Dilruba... Dilruba...
I didn't put up with you all these years
for nothing.
I won't let you pull this trick on me.
-The child is dead.
No.
Hilmi.
Talk, God damn it!
I left you for dead in that dumpster.
I never thought I'd see you again.
You did kill me.
I'm not the same person anymore.
Don't worry. I don't want payback
for what you've done to me.
I have a job for you.
Zarok!
Is that my daughter?
For God's sake!
Her eyes look just like mine.
She's just a baby.
They could change.
We won't run away anymore.
We won't.
We'll live for our daughter now.
The baby's wooden cradle rocks.
On the roof, the heavy rain knocks.
Daddy's coming from the docks.
Hush little baby, hush.
Hush little baby, hush.
Nurten! Stop shaking the child,
she'll turn into butter.
Please, take her to the shade!
Yes, Mustafa, yes!
The swing you built is such a big deal!
You won't shut up about it
until I take her there.
We're just fine!
-How can you be fine?
I'm going nuts because of the heat,
you're saying you're fine!
Come, my little girl.
Your father is driving me crazy.
Remember the one I built for us
in the garden in Diyarbakir?
I'll build the same swing here tomorrow.
A bigger one.
I'll take you to it myself.
It'll be decent this time.
No more broken ropes.
This boy will cause you trouble.
He'll make you give birth every year.
Silly Mustafa!
Mommy's little girl...
Did daddy buy you a bracelet?
Sleep well and grow up,
become mommy's beautiful girl.
 Mustafa! The baby!
My daughter!
Let her go!
Where are you taking her?
Take this too.
-What was your name?
-Zarok.
Is she sick?
No. It's just a birthmark.
Zarok!
A whole new life began for Zarok.
Seasons passed,
but Nurten still suffered.
-My daughter isn't dead.
-Please, Nurten. For God's sake.
Don't cry!
Don't act like she's dead!
She's not!
She'll come back!
Zarok watched them from a distance,
being a part of their sorrow.
Please, Nurten, don't.
-My daughter isn't dead.
-Come on.
-I'd know it if she was dead.
-Come on.
With regret and pain.
While Zelis lived a fake life
in the tower where she's imprisoned,...
...Zarok grew up on the streets,
by the rules of his own world.
Happy birthday Zelis!
Thank you, thank you!
Finally, Zarok decided to be a part of
the sorrowful family's life.
Zelis, living in solitude without love,
grew up to be a dreamer princess.
Police! Police!
Get him!
-I didn't do anything.
-Turn around!
We were just smoking with friends!
Zelis thought
the letters ZC on her birthmark...
...were the initials
of her prince charming, her savior.
How am I going to find you?
If your father let you out of the house,
we'd find him. But you never go out.
He thinks something bad will happen.
It's as if I'm in jail.
I'm going to get a necklace
with the letters ZC.
You want to wear your stupidity then.
You're stupid!
He'll find me. Otherwise,
why would his name be written on me?
My father is here!
Hakki waited with great patience
for Zelis to grow up.
Welcome, Mr. Hakki.
He was cold and distant.
What a beautiful woman.
Who is she?
I don't know. She's probably
my father's new girlfriend.
But Nurten never gave up
waiting for her daughter.
Sometime later, the day arrived for
the villains to carry out their plans.
You look so beautiful!
I'm jealous!
What's up, girl?
I don't want this, Meltem. It's not
even close to what I dreamed of.
No one likes my brother at first.
He's a bit annoying.
Give him some time. You'll like him
once you get to know him.
We'll be sisters-in-law!
This is only the engagement.
It's not like we're getting married now.
Enough with the fairy tales.
Come back down to earth.
You look so beautiful.
We both know that
there is no prince charming.
It's not even close to
what I dreamed of.
-What did you dream of?
-Aunt Necla, was it you?
Come downstairs.
We'll have the ring ceremony soon.
Iâ€™ll follow you to hell.
-You like my watch?
-It's nice.
It can't even be a tire for my car.
Chief.
Who is going to present the rings?
I don't know about that stuff.
You do it.
What's up, dad?
Go be with the girl, idiot!
Alright, dad, relax.
You do your thing.
You wanted an engagement,
we're doing it. What else do you want?
Okay, okay. I'll take care of it.
You like my watch?
I'm sorry, I'm terribly sorry!
For God's sake!
What the hell is this?
-I'm sorry!
-Aylin, my love!
Dude, are you going to marry
this moron?
It's over, okay. It's okay.
I'm going crazy!
That was so embarrassing!
What's happening down there?
Oh, mom!
Where are you?
Come already.
I know you're close to me.
You're somewhere around here.
I can feel you.
Come and save me.
If I find you someday,
I'll kick your butt!
What the hell?
Who the hell is this?
Dude! My watch!
The watch is gone!
Who was that, Zelis?
Who was that?
What happened? Is he gone?
Zelis, say something!
Zelis, what happened?
Why are you screaming? What is it?
Stop screaming! What happened?
Tell me! Tell me, what is it?
Girls? Are you okay?
-We're fine, dad.
-A thief broke in.
-Thief!
-Thief!
Man, the watch is gone.
How could a thief break in
when you were all in front of the door?
Sir, we don't know either. We were
outside, but we didn't see anything.
I checked, there's nothing important
that was stolen.
It doesn't matter if you find them,
but the thieves shouldn't come back.
Dad, my watch is gone!
What do you mean, "it doesn't matter"?
To hell with your watch!
Why don't you show them the shoe?
If I do, they'll lock him up.
I'll never see him again.
Zelis! You'll see him, and then what?
He's a thief!
How could you possibly see him?
Just keep your eyes open.
Hello! Do you hear me, son?
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Listen to me. Where is your mind?
Sir, we know their location.
We'll go pick them up now.
No way.
Girls, we checked the neighborhood.
You still didn't tell me what you want.
I didn't understand
the shoe business either.
My dear Kenan,
this is an assignment for school.
But people keep running away
because of your car's flashing lights.
And we can't find
what we're looking for.
Look, you can go now.
We can check here on our own.
No way, Miss Meltem.
Your father would kill me.
We have a 151 situation in 7671.
All units respond.
-But I have to go.
-Come on.
Keep your phone on.
I'll call you when we're done. Okay?
Call me!
What the hell am I saying?
Meltem, maybe he should have stayed.
I'm so scared.
It would be hard for us to find this guy
with him around. This is so exciting!
The tea is ready!
-Girls, are you looking for someone?
-Yes, the owner of this shoe.
Guys, anyone recognize this shoe?
What the hell?
No. You should go now.
Or you might end up in an R-rated movie.
We are going to pay 1000 liras
to the owner of this shoe!
-It fits, it fits.
-It doesn't. Don't push it.
No, it can fit.
-Get up!
-Dude, I'm trying it on.
Up!
Put it on!
-It doesn't fit!
-Shut up, man!
-There's a line here!
-Get away!
Get up, hurry!
Get away!
ZC, ZC...
Here is ZC!
Girl, you saw what they looked like.
And he's one of them.
Come on, Kenan!
Damn reception!
Shut up! I said shut up!
Walk! I said walk!
Shut up!
Let's see the 1000 liras.
-Shut up! Shut up!
-Do you keep it here?
-Shut up!
-Let it go! I won't give it!
Let it go!
-Shut up!
Shut up!
-Zelis! Zelis! Hurry!
-Girls, are you okay?
Help! Kenan! Kenan!
Zelis! Zelis, get up.
Get up, girl!
They're gonna kill us here! Get up!
Get up! Get up!
Come on! Zelis!
Why don't you believe me, Meltem?
I'm not lying.
Meltem, listen to me, please.
Wait a minute.
I swear to God, I saw it.
He was wearing my necklace. ZC.
Zelis!
They put knives to our throats.
Okay, I did it for fun.
I wanted to help you let go of these
unrealistic expectations. But remember:
You're engaged now.
To my brother.
Zelis!
No, that boy is useless.
Brothers! Have some tea!
Glowing red!
If you don't drink, you regret it.
Whoop! Brother, tea?
I'm burnt! I'm burnt!
I'm burnt!
Come here!
-Zarok!
-Come here.
Here.
-Ziya!
-Ziya!
-Ziya!
-Ziya!
Come here, come here!
Ziya's head exploded!
Brats!
Why did you make him do that?
You should go to the hospital.
His head is gone.
Get off, brats!
Get away!
Derya!
Here.
-Thank you, Zarok.
It's not for him.
It's for my own good.
We can't sleep all night
because of his cough.
He should take that,
so we can sleep in peace.
Okay, I'm out.
Hello!
Are you gonna wake up?
Where am I?
What time is it?
You're at my place.
It's 5pm.
Oh, no, my father!
I'm late! I'm horribly late!
You're so handsome!
My phone...
-Where are you coming from?
-Necla, you scared me.
Where have you been?
Did you meet Cemal?
No.
But please don't tell my father.
Okay. Go to your room.
He shouldn't see you like this.
I won't tell him this time,
but don't do it again.
Good night.
-Whoa!
-Boy, where did you come from?
Nurten! Look who's here! Look!
Is he Zarok? Tell that useless boy
to stay for dinner.
Okay, okay. I'm staying.
I won't run away.
Mustafa, take these boxes
to the village chief.
He'll give it to those in need.
Anyway, you'll know what to do.
Son, you bring what you steal.
We give this stuff to children.
It's a sin.
-They steal from you too.
Nurten.
Thank you so much, it's delicious.
-Enjoy.
Mustafa.
Here.
Is this a sin as well?
-Let me check.
It's not, but it has no lights. I mean,
don't you have anything with lights?
Something blinking.
-Mustafa. Give it to me!
You bring everything here.
Keep some of it for yourself, son.
-I'm fine, Nurten.
-Look, he's smart.
When you find money,
you lose your mind.
Look, Mustafa here is such a great mind,
and he has no money to show for it.
Sure, sure.
My baby...
I wish I could bring her back to you.
Ziya, can you break this rock?
Get out of here! Get lost!
And you sit down.
I'm looking for someone.
Can you help me?
Hello!
Is there anybody in there?
My phone.
Is that my phone ringing?
My love? My darling?
Hello. Zelis?
-Cemal, is that you?
Of course it's me.
Who else tells you
nice things on the phone?
We'll be at my place with the guys
tonight. You should come too.
We'll have drinks,
listen to music and chill out.
I can talk to your father.
I have a stomachache.
It's better if I don't go.
I won't leave the house today.
Hello?
-Hello.
-Cemal?
-Zelis?
-Hello?
-Zelis?
Hello?
Don't panic.
If you're going to ask the time,
it's 4pm.
I have time till the evening.
-Tell me.
-What?
Why are you trying so hard
to return my shoe?
-What's your name?
-Zarok.
-With a K or a G?
-Zaro. K.
-Zarok.
-They call me "Zarok child".
What's your name?
-Zelis.
-That explains the Z in the necklace.
No, it's not like that.
That's your name.
Look.
What do you see?
-Well...
-Look, your name is written here.
-Really?
-This is a birthmark.
They named me Zelis
because of the Z in that mark.
But I think those two letters
are enclosed in a heart.
It may be a childish dream,...
...but when you have something like
this, what else can you think of?
Do you think this is a coincidence?
Yes.
Look, sweetie. All the items
in this building change places.
Because everyone's a thief here.
If you're smart,
you write your initials on your stuff.
Look, it's everywhere.
Look, there it is. And there.
Even here. Look. Here.
Is that my name?
Can I see it one more time?
Maybe it's not me.
Maybe you're looking for Ziya.
Go look for him downstairs.
He's thick but he's a decent guy.
Should I call him?
-Don't make fun.
Alright, fine.
Let's say it's me.
You found me.
What now?
-I don't know.
We met.
Let's be friends.
I thought you were getting married
the day I entered your house.
It was an engagement.
Engagement, wedding...
What's the difference?
The father of the guy I got engaged to
is my father's business partner, Selim.
My father is really overprotective.
Whenever I leave the house, he thinks
something bad will happen to me.
-So, how did you come here?
-If he knew, he'd kill me.
I thought I could start my own life
if I got married.
So I agreed.
But he's so annoying. I don't like him.
He's showing off because
his father is the chief of police.
It's time you leave.
Come on. Come, come.
Take this too.
-You don't need to be afraid.
I won't harm you.
I'd be happier if you kept it.
But I want something
that is important to you in return.
-You have my shoe.
-I can't put that around my neck!
-I can give you this.
-No, keep it.
How about this?
No.
See, it's important to you.
Please, can I have it?
No. Come on. Come on girl, get out.
Come on, come on.
Why are you saying that?
I have time.
We were talking, it was nice.
What's the harm in talking?
You must have
lots of things to tell me.
What's your life like?
What does Zarok mean? Your friends...
He lives here.
Let's give him a good beating.
-Who are they?
-You were asking. They are my friends.
-What do they want from you?
-I don't know. Maybe they want me dead.
What? Why?
He escaped through here.
Damn it.
I borrowed something
that belonged to them.
-Then give it back!
-I can't. I sold it!
Run! Run, run!
Wait!
Wait!
Faster, faster!
-Stop, stop. Let's talk.
-You can talk if you like.
They don't speak our language.
Wait!
Are you okay?
-That was... So exciting.
-So exciting.
Are you sure
you still want to get to know me?
Are you crazy?
When you pull the handbrake,
the back of the car starts sliding.
Then you hit the gas, and you drift.
It's that easy.
-How?
-Watch me for a while.
I'll teach you when the time comes.
Why don't you ever
talk about your family?
Where were you born?
Your mother, your father...
I was born into the world
where you found me.
The man who raised me, whom I knew
as my father was shot when I was little.
He died right before my eyes.
I found out later
that he wasn't my real father.
No one has any idea where I came from.
Anybody I could ask is dead.
Any other questions, princess?
All of my life summed up
isn't worth just a moment of your life.
Maybe it's not the same thing,
but I don't have a mother.
I only have a deadbeat dad.
Maybe all this happened
so we could be together.
Go now.
-Where?
-Home.
-I don't get it.
-This is the end.
-The end of what?
-Look, you're a house cat.
Okay? And I'm a stray dog.
We're different.
You'll get hurt.
What's our difference?
I'm so happy with you.
What's our difference?
Don't you see?
-See what?
What do you see?
You belong there.
I can only steal a tiny piece of it.
Do you understand now?
Zelis.
Zelis! Wait a minute!
Here!
I stole a piece from there!
Damn it!
We'll meet again, right?
Where were you?
Dad, I'm going to tell...
You should listen...
I'm not a child anymore, dad.
You don't have the right to keep me away
from the outside world.
You're asking me to do things
I don't want to do.
With all due respect, I think
you should listen to me now, dad.
Necla, take her to the room.
She's not allowed to go out
until I say otherwise.
You're responsible for her.
Do your job well.
Don't waste all my years of patience.
What do you want me to do?
I can't get close to her.
I text her 10 times a day,
she doesn't reply.
I call her, she doesn't come.
I'm trying, dad.
What do you mean, you're trying?
All you care about is
cars or hanging out!
Son, didn't we talk about this?
You told us not to worry and that she'd
be all over you in three months.
It was exactly like that
before the engagement.
But things changed after the engagement.
I don't get it either.
I don't say much
out of respect for Mr. Hakki.
But I've had enough.
-Take care of your fiancÃ©e.
Someone's circling around her.
Let's take care of the wedding at once.
Wait a minute.
What do you mean "circling around"?
She's my fiancÃ©e after all.
Who's circling around her?
Meltem.
Who's that guy circling around Meltem?
-How could I know it? I don't know.
-Look, dear.
You two are really close.
You should know.
If there is another guy,
you should tell us for her own good.
-It's a guy named Zarok.
-Zarok?
You know, she's had this obsession about
her birthmark since she was a child.
It's about that.
Zarok!
What the hell is Zarok?
Where can we find this man?
Let me go smash his face.
She doesn't tell me much
because I disapprove of this.
But as far as I've seen,
they're not lovers or anything.
They're just friends.
-Oh, so you've seen him in person!
And you didn't say anything.
She doesn't want to see me
because I disapprove of it.
But I took their photo
the other day.
Give it to me.
Is this him? Is it?
-Yes, it's him.
Can I see it?
Oh, no.
Where did you take this photo?
I'm looking for Zarok.
-Who are you?
It's none of your business.
Where is he?
What's this about?
I remember you.
What do you want this time?
Can we talk alone?
Go on, bro.
You know why I'm here.
You gave the kid, you took the money,
end of story.
I'm sorry about your father,
but it had to be done.
And you're his son.
It's obvious what you're after.
We can make a deal.
He wasn't my father.
And what deal is this?
You'll stay away from Zelis!
Don't you understand?
If you want money,
I can take care of it.
But stay away from her.
You don't want to get in trouble
with the police.
Come on. Be a good boy,
just like you were when we met.
There's no point in
raking up the past.
Do you understand?
Look at me, do you understand?
If I ever see you with her again,
I'll kill you.
I am going to kill you!
I am going to kill you!
I am going to kill you!
-Look at me.
If you ever get in touch
with Zelis again,...
...I won't come alone.
Come on.
-Beat it!
Go on!
Get out of here!
I found her. It's her.
I found her! I found her!
Are you really here?
My heart hurts.
That means
weakness has left your heart.
Take me away.
Mr. Hakki.
Talk, God damn it!
Help me...
Thank you.
-That's the way it is from now on.
You scratch my back,
and I'll scratch yours.
-Where are we going?
-To start a new life.
Just like in fairy tales.
Yes.
Well, ours is a bit different.
I'll take you away from wealth
and introduce you to poverty.
Are you ready to be poor?
With you, I'm ready for anything.
He has no name.
He goes by the nickname "Zarok".
When Blonde Necmi died,
he was left alone.
He was convicted of robbery.
He's wanted for petty crimes.
You have plenty of cops out there.
They can find him.
We could file a complaint with the
prosecutor's office and burn ourselves.
Sir, there are two men outside.
They claim to know Zarok.
We don't steal! We don't! Zarok did it,
he stole everything! Uncuff us!
We have to find him ourselves.
Otherwise, we'll lose everything
within a few months.
Don't worry. Let's hope that
she has her mobile phone with her.
Then, we can find her.
"I'm so sorry. It's all because of me.
I shouldn't have said anything.
Wherever you are, don't come back.
Be happy.
Your loving friend, Meltem."
Where are we now?
Look at them!
They are so cute, aren't they?
Let's pet them, please!
I feel refreshed.
-Do you like this place?
This is what you call poverty?
Does the beautiful princess have
any other wishes from her genie?
I wish you had such powers.
It would be nice.
I think you do, but you're hiding them.
You climbing through windows and stuff.
When I think about you, you show up.
I'm sure you can fly as well,
but you're keeping it secret, right?
Yes! I'm guilty!
I also have an outfit
with the letter Z on it.
But spandex don't look good on me.
It looks weird.
It would be so nice if you could fly.
You'd take me, and we'd touch the sky.
We'd escape anytime we felt sad.
I can't fly, but I think I can give you
the one thing you want the most.
Is that a wishing tree?
Do they actually work?
Everyone waits for someone.
Hoping for them to come.
I think this tree
keeps only that hope alive.
Make a wish.
I wish you could bring back my mother.
All my life, I've always wondered
what a mother's love would feel like.
If I brought your mother back,
would you love me more?
Even more than right now?
Wait for me.
-Where are you going?
-Wait!
You and your goddamn timing!
Why did you bring her here?
Where is she?
-Inside.
-Does she know?
-She's still unconscious.
-What have you done to her?
-I put her to sleep.
-Where is the guy?
-Downstairs, in the trunk of his car.
What should I do with him?
-Wait for tomorrow.
Your father will tell you what to do.
Stay here, watch her.
When she wakes up,
see if she knows anything.
Yes, sir.
You'll get married first thing in the
morning. We've had enough.
-Calm down. Calm down.
-What do you want from me?
Where is Zarok?
What have you done to him?
Calm down. Calm down.
Sit here, girl.
I won't hurt you.
I want to help you.
Listen to me, please.
Your father and his men will come soon.
I want to tell you something
before they arrive.
I might not be able to repeat it.
But please don't scream.
Your mother was very ill.
She hid her illness from Mr. Hakki.
She wanted to have a kid
before she died.
That was the reason why she married
Mr. Hakki in the first place.
And Mr. Hakki
only cared about her wealth.
When Mrs. Dilruba got pregnant,...
...she stopped taking her pills
so that the baby would not be harmed.
She couldn't survive
excessive bleeding during labor.
We lost her and the baby.
She had prepared a will
before her death.
The money which Mr. Hakki was after...
...would be left to the child
under one condition:
The child could only receive the money
after he or she got married.
And if something happened to the child,
the money would be donated to charity.
We needed a child for Mr. Hakki
to be able to receive that money.
And we kidnapped a child.
You are that child.
Mr. Hakki is not your father.
What are you talking about, Necla?
No, no!
Do whatever they ask you to do.
Let them keep the money.
Play dumb.
They'll leave you alone.
My dear girl.
My beautiful girl.
I was scared that something bad
would happen to you.
That's what I always feared.
That's why
I've always kept you by my side.
There are evil people out there.
Now, I want to make sure
you're in safe hands.
Everybody's here.
Mr. Selim, the registrar...
Necla will help you get ready.
Come on, don't make me sad.
Okay, my beautiful girl?
I don't want to do things
that would make you sad.
The papers are ready.
All she has to do is sign them.
The money will be transferred
to her account shortly afterwards.
And later, it can be transferred
to other accounts.
-How much money are we talking about?
-Almost 200 million dollars.
-Where is your sister?
-How should I know, dad?
That prick is in the garage.
What should I do?
Throw him off the roof.
He's a thief, after all.
He fell down while running.
Put some stolen stuff in his pockets.
Look, this is our final job.
We're in this neck deep.
Don't let anyone get in the way.
With pleasure, dad.
With pleasure.
-Who's my mother?
-I don't know.
Come on! Get going!
Are you ready to fly? Huh?
Are you ready to fly?
Damn, those are my wedding shoes!
Prick!
Isn't it enough?
-Where are you? We're waiting for you.
-Okay, dad, I'm coming.
-Hurry up.
-Okay, okay. I'm coming.
Come here. Come here!
Look, look! Oh, women...
If you hadn't made things
so complicated,...
...I'd have given her to you
after a while, in a slightly used state.
Luckily for you,
I don't want to waste my energy today.
I'll need it for tonight.
You lost.
Push him when it's calm down there.
Or do whatever you like.
Just make sure he's dead.
-Okay.
You're the groom, I guess.
Excited?
Oh, I'm so excited.
We're dying out of excitement.
We're living tons of adventures.
-Excuse me?
I'm just kidding.
Sit, sit, wait, wait!
Alright, go ahead, jump.
-They're here.
-What about the cops?
Don't worry.
I'll take care of them.
Alright, jump now.
It would be so nice if you could fly.
You'd take me, and we'd touch the sky.
We'd escape anytime we felt sad.
Zarok!
-What the hell?
-Who are you?
Don't!
Zarok.
Stop!
What's happening?
-Where have you been?
-I managed to fly.
-Get off me!
-No!
Burn! Burn! Burn!
Brother, stop.
Take her to her mother.
Help! Help!
You made it.
You're not excited anymore.
-I have to take you to the hospital.
-I'm fine, go on.
Were you taking me to my mother?
Stop here.
I have to take you to the hospital.
You're not well.
Don't! Don't do that.
They'll find us there.
There...
Did you know about it all along?
You were just a little baby.
Day and night, your mother
waited for you to come back.
She suffered a lot.
How do you know all this?
I was the one who kidnapped you.
Zarok. Zarok, wake up.
Zarok. Don't leave me, Zarok.
Zarok. Don't leave me, Zarok.
Don't leave me, Zarok.
Zarok, wake up! Zarok!
Don't leave me, Zarok!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Help me!
Is there anybody out there?
-Wait here, don't come out.
-Help me.
Don't go!
Zarok. Don't leave me. Zarok!
Is there anybody out there? Help!
Help me!
Is there anybody out there?
What happened? Tell me.
Did they elope or something?
How should I know? Something's happened.
The boy came in a mess. He's resting.
The vet had a hard time
fixing him up.
You didn't let me come inside.
You let the vet, but not me.
Nurten, enough already.
Don't make noise.
Come on. Make breakfast.
They can eat when they wake up.
Come on. Come on.
-Silly Mustafa!
-For God's sake.
Eat, but you're the only one eating.
If you eat it all,
you'll be the first to be eaten.
Easy. Come on.
Son, why did you get up?
Zarok!
Are you okay?
Don't be afraid, my dear girl.
No one can find you here, don't worry.
You must be hungry.
Eat something first.
I'll question you later.
You can tell me everything.
You are so pretty.
God bless you. God bless you.
Thank you.
That place looks nice. Where is it?
-Where? Oh... That's our hometown.
-Is that where you're from?
Something happened there.
We ran away and came here.
Something happened here.
We couldn't run this time, we stayed.
Anyway. Your tea is getting cold.
We can talk later.
I'll be outside if you need me.
I brought you a change of clothes.
God bless you. God bless you.
My beautiful girl.
Tell me, Mister Zarok.
What the hell...
Oh, boy!
You're torn to pieces!
But the girl is so beautiful.
Well done.
See, it's important to you.
Please, can I have it?
No.
Everybody waits for someone.
Hoping for them to come.
Take her to her mother.
Forgive me for what I've put you
through. You are a real mother.
What have you put us through?
You've helped us feed ourselves.
This is your home as well.
I wanted to help you,
but Mustafa didn't let me.
The wait is over, Nurten.
It's over.
The wait is over.
What?
My baby...
Mom?
Mom!
My baby...
My girl...
-Mom!
-My baby!
-Mom!
-My baby!
Mom...
Look, Mustafa!
I told you she would come back!
Dad?
My girl.
Thank God.
Did Zarok actually jump off that roof?
-Would you rather he did?
-Yes.
Is Zarok dead?
-I'm right here, dude.
-So, Zarok isn't dead, right?
No, Kadir.
The villains
paid the price for their sins.
The good ones
went on with their lives.
So why did Zarok end up in prison?
Remember, he borrowed something?
I told you.
He promised not to do it again.
-Come on, Zarok!
You don't want to leave, I guess.
-That's why they let him go.
Zarok, you made us cry.
What am I going to do
with the kids now?
They'll ask about you
every time they visit.
You can tell them.
But don't get too excited.
Come see me when I'm out.
I have things to tell you as well.
-Come, come.
-My dear brother.
My brother.
-Come on, bro.
-Say "hi" to Zelis for us.
-I will.
-Zarok, don't be a stranger.
-Just for a while, please.
No?
So, where are we going?
I'm going to the neighborhood.
I don't know about you.
Why do you always have to kidnap me?
I'm willing this time.
Where are we going?
Girl, stay away from me!
You're nothing but trouble.
What kind of a thief are you?
I have 200 million dollars,
and you don't want me!
-No way! Is it all yours?
-I can have it all if I find a man.
-You know, we have Ziya.
-Hey! Don't be ridiculous!
