Ever since I was a little girl,
I had a dream.
One day I'd become the superhero
in my very own fairy tale.
I can fly, be invisible,
and at the end,
save the world.
Funny thing is,
sometimes you have to be careful
what you wish for,
'cause one day,
it may come true.
Hurry up!
Hey!
I don't remember the flight,
just the feeling.
It was like going on the
scariest ride in a theme park.
Thinking you're going to die.
I had to help them.
And I had to do it fast.
Hello?
Dean, get your ticket
and come home now.
Bye.
Paging Dr. Stateman,
Dr. Stateman, please.
Thank God she was okay.
A handful of small cuts
and bruises
felt like the greatest victory
in the world.
We beat the unthinkable.
And I,
I almost lost my best friends.
What was I thinking
going on that road?
How in the world
did we come out of this?
I had this strange feeling
inside of me.
It was like I was given a second
chance to make things right.
And then all of a sudden,
it hit me.
What if...
this is my moment?
My chance to become
the superhero
I always dreamed about.
All I have to do
is figure out
how to save the world.
Okay, now,
thanks for coming, Terry.
- Terry.
- Sylvia.
Good to see you.
This is our son Dean.
- Terry Knight.
- Dean Goodwin.
Can I get you a cup or coffee,
anything?
No, no, no, I'm fine,
I only have a minute.
Okay.
Ah...
I'm sorry, we just...
we don't have any new
information yet.
But we will.
Did you talk to her friends?
Of course, but we haven't, um,
found her.
We need something, Terry.
Please, we need something.
These kind of investigations
can take some time.
It can be...
difficult to, uh...
locate things.
What kind of things?
- Signs of life.
- Oh.
- Oh, God.
- Yes, we'll...
We'll find her,
we'll find her, right.
Just let her be, let her be.
Sign of life?
I'll show you sign of life.
Dad?
Yeah, mhm, yeah.
No, no, I'm with you.
Let me have a chat with them
'cause I think it's...
Dad.
- Dad, are you home?
- I'm on the phone.
Mhm, hang on a sec.
Danni?
Is that you?
Yeah, uh...
Hey, do you have a minute?
Not today, pal.
Got a red-eye to catch,
have an early one in New York
tomorrow morning.
Mrs. Lee is on the way over.
You're not in trouble again,
are you, Danni?
Yeah.
Yeah what?
I swear, if you are,
you're on your own.
You hear me?
Danni!
I hear you.
Get the door, will ya?
Sorry about that,
no, don't worry.
- It's nothing, just my kid.
- Love you too.
What did he say?
Nothing.
Oh, he can ask but I can't?
Sarah, I need you to talk to me.
Please, do you wanna,
do you wanna go somewhere?
No, I don't wanna go anywhere.
Okay, well, will you please
talk to me?
We hit a turn, the car flew
in the river, I don't know.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Did Andre put you and Angie
up to this?
The moment I saw this boy,
I knew he was up to no good.
You should not be dating
a boy that...
- Can you go now?
- Just give me the phone.
- What did your father say?
- Nothing!
He said because of my boyfriend
we're all now suspects!
Sarah!
How fast were they going?
Over the speed limit.
When was the last time
you talked to her?
Two months ago.
She was gonna come over
to visit.
Did she?
No.
Nothing since?
No.
No letters, emails, texts?
Deep secrets?
No, we...
respected each other's space.
What does that mean?
We weren't very close.
Hm.
See, I got a problem here.
It's a three-person wreck
and only two accounted for.
We got search teams
in the woods around here
in case she managed to walk away
from the wreck, pass out.
Dive teams in the river,
but, um...
nothing yet.
So, for now,
it's a missing persons case.
Suspicious circumstances.
You know why
I'm telling you this?
What, am I suspect?
No, my daughter was in the car
with yours.
Oh.
Is she okay?
Did you talk to her,
ask her what happened?
- I did.
- And?
Our relationship
is a bit like yours.
We, uh,
respect each other's space.
Hey, Terry.
Can you come down here
for a sec?
You know what he's gonna
tell me, don't ya?
I'm not supposed to be here.
I'm sure you can understand why.
Angie?
Selena.
Yes?
After I said no, behind my back,
you still sent in
the application.
Dad, do you know
how many kids get chances
- at something like this?
- No!
I will not have my daughter
waste four years of her life
on some stupid thing
that will never pay off.
Stupid, says who?
Luis.
You will not go
on this interview.
And I will not hear about this
school in this house again.
Is this clear?
You're a monster, you know that?
Selena.
Come back here.
Finish your dinner.
Dad, Dad!
You can't live my life
for me, okay?
Hey, as long as I put a roof
over your head,
food on your table,
and clothes on your body,
you do not get a chance to say
what I can and cannot do.
Is this clear?
Crystal.
Excuse me.
Luis.
Sonia, I know
what is best for her.
You see, what is that?
Selena.
We do not slam doors
in this house.
- The door is wide open.
- Then who did it?
I don't know how did it, okay?
A ghost did it.
You do not talk to me like that.
Because you don't believe
anything I say.
It was the back door.
The wind must have shut it.
No, must have been me.
Selena por favor, yeah.
Luis, enough, please.
Have you ever heard
of the word "respect?"
Yeah.
It goes very well
with the word "mutual."
Goodnight.
Your father always said this is
the best remedy for insomnia.
Want some?
No, thank you.
Sort of feels like deja vu.
When this happened to Katie,
I was feeling the same feelings
I felt then.
Well, your feelings are wrong,
she's alive.
Oh, and you know that how?
Did someone contact you?
No.
Well, she wouldn't.
But the funny thing is,
you're the closest by blood
and the farthest by heart.
So funny.
Yeah, like you and me.
Wait, I'm sorry.
Come on.
Come on back.
Come sit down.
I guess the last time
we saw each other
we were sitting right here
in this room.
What was that, five years ago?
Did you find
what you were looking for
all the way across the country?
Are we really gonna
talk about this now?
Never mind.
I was just asking my son
a simple question.
Fine.
We can talk about it now.
I mean, I know exactly
where this is going.
My failed music career,
my pathetic personal life, or...
No, let me guess.
The fact that I've turned
my back on my only child.
You did.
With your help.
She chose it.
I gave her a home,
a place where she could grow
and experience the world
in full color,
like every child should.
She went to a wonderful school
and she had good friends.
Yeah, lots of expensive toys,
I get it.
And how was I supposed to
compete with that?
It's not about competition,
Dean.
It's about the decisions
you make in life.
Something you could never do.
Doesn't look like she made the
right decision now, does it?
That night that we were here,
you played something.
It was...
It was quite...
It was quite wonderful.
I haven't written anything
since then.
Do you remember it?
I woke her up.
Play it.
But Dad's sleeping,
I don't wanna wake him up.
No I'm not.
Play it, please.
Wake her up.
Sylvia.
Sylvia.
Angie?
My dearest Sylvia,
I'm sure it's not easy
for you to read this,
but believe me,
writing this wasn't easy either.
You once told me the moment
you learn your true purpose
in life,
destiny appears
at your doorstep.
You were right.
After the crash,
my destiny came calling.
It said I have to save
the world.
Very soon, when I finish
what I started,
I'll come back home.
You and Grandpa
will be very proud of me.
- Sylvie?
- Mom?
You all right?
What are you doing?
Her passport, it's not here.
Okay, well, where is it?
It's just not here.
Are you sure?
She always travels
with her passport, always.
What were... somebody
would've called by now.
All this time I've been thinking
that I'm going crazy,
hearing voices
and seeing things.
She's alive,
she's alive.
State police need your help
in locating
a missing Gardenland teenager.
Seventeen-year-old
Angelina Goodwin
was last seen on Sunday.
Goodwin has dark brown hair
and light brown eyes.
She's 5'4" tall and weighs
between 110 and 118 pounds.
She was last seen wearing
a lavender dress
and a denim jacket.
If you have any information,
please call 555-4745.
Danni.
Danni.
- Boo!
- Ah!
Are you done playing?
Angie Goodwin?
Danni Lin.
I need you to do something.
Go to the police
and tell them the truth.
Me?
You.
Where are you?
Right in front of you.
- Inside the monkey?
- Boo!
Every time I opened my eyes
and found myself in a new place,
I felt like a fugitive
on the run.
My wounds were healing quickly.
I started having these dreams.
I felt like
I was being followed.
Why have a refrigerator
if you don't put food in it?
No.
I was no fugitive on the run.
I was a superhero on a mission.
And this is the next stop
on my journey,
the City of Angels.
Angie.
It's called Angel.
I wrote it.
You like it?
Wait, how did you get in here?
Through the window.
Like a bird.
You left a spare key
under the doormat.
It's the oldest trick
in the book, you know.
You should be careful.
What, what are you doing here?
You haven't seen me
in five years
and that's the only thing
you can say?
The whole world is going crazy
looking for you.
You're on TV, in the newspaper,
on the radio.
What were you thinking?
I'm like a celebrity.
Would you like an autograph?
No, that's not funny.
Do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?
The police are looking for you.
But you won't tell them.
Right?
Hi.
I tried texting
but you didn't answer.
Are you busy?
I, um, just came in myself.
Yeah, I saw you downstairs.
Any news?
Is it okay if I...
if we talk tomorrow at school?
Yeah, sure.
Renee.
It was good to see you.
She's pretty.
Is that your girlfriend?
Look, um, get your things.
I'm gonna take you
to the airport.
But I just got here.
But you can't stay here.
I'm gonna put you on a plane
and I'll get Sylvia and Grandpa
to pick you up, okay?
You're throwing me out.
No, I'm not throwing you out.
When you walked through
that door,
I thought you were
gonna give me a hug.
Tell me how much you missed me,
and how happy you are to see me.
- I am.
- But you didn't.
You didn't even ask me
if I was okay.
Or if I needed help or...
"Oh, I'm so glad you're alive!"
Don't say that, of course I am.
- I'm just...
- You're what?
You're what?
You know what's sad?
I came here looking
for my father,
but instead I found a stranger
who I don't even know.
I thought you were different.
- I was wrong.
- Angie.
Angie.
Hey.
Angie!
Angie!
Angie!
Angie?
You've grown up.
Thanks.
You haven't.
You gonna run away
if police show up?
No, I'll just pretend
I don't know you.
You're very good at that.
Listen, back there, I,
I shouldn't have reacted
the way I did.
I'm sorry.
You're a coward.
Yes I am.
Any chance that we can start
everything over?
I can fix you.
But you have to listen
and do everything I say.
Are you in?
Just as I thought.
Angie, okay.
I'm in.
Good.
First order of business then
is to fill up your refrigerator
and buy you new clothes.
Wait, what's wrong
with my clothes?
Nothing, if you're going for
a 70 and over look.
Come on, where are you parked?
Uh, it's in the shop.
What's wrong with it?
- I don't know.
- Fine.
Add a new car
to the shopping list too.
You're crazy, you're crazy.
I had to see you.
What are you doing?
You don't answer my phone calls,
you don't respond to my texts.
My mom took it away from me.
I'm sorry.
- How's your hand?
- It's fine.
And you?
What happened?
Where is she?
- Sarah?
- Yeah.
Are you sleeping?
I'm watching TV.
You should try and get
some rest, honey.
Okay.
Goodnight.
I'm glad you're okay.
The fairy tale garden.
You know how obsessed she is
with that place.
Where did you get that?
Mom.
What is he doing here?
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Collins.
I just wanted to make sure
Sarah was okay.
- In the middle of the night?
- Mom, please do not make such...
You get out of my house right
now before I call the police.
- What?
- Get out, I'm not gonna
repeat myself twice, get out!
- Come on.
- You stay right here,
young lady, and you get out
of my house, go.
I'm really sorry, Mrs. Collins.
- I would never...
- Get out of my house!
What's the charge?
I can't.
I have a board meeting
in an hour.
Fine.
You do what you have to do.
- Is everything okay?
- Perfect.
Luis, can you please pull over?
Sure.
I swear, this kid
is not gonna ruin my meeting.
Alice, get me the sheriff.
Tell him it's important.
Call me back.
Yeah?
I thought I was going to do
the hotel pickup
but they sent me to the airport.
I don't know,
someone changed it.
Sure.
I'm dealing with something.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Bye.
Just got a call from the police.
My son's been arrested.
Again.
You got kids, right?
A girl I think, I remember.
What's your secret?
I tell her my house, my rules.
If she disagrees,
I teach her a lesson.
For example?
For example, the other day, um,
she sent in an application
to this stupid college
I told her not to,
and when the letter
for the interview came,
I took it right in front of her
and I ripped it.
You serious?
That's the only way
she will learn.
Is this funny?
Have you ever gotten a call
in the middle of the night
telling you your kid
has been arrested?
How about juvenile court?
Ever been?
The truth is,
I'd give it all up if I could
trade places with you
and have the same problems
you have with your kid.
Does he know this?
Take me to the police station.
What about your meeting?
What about my son?
Italian.
No brainer.
Hey, you can cook Italian,
right?
Did you fall asleep?
One sec, I'm coming!
Look at you!
Mhm!
I think you're ready.
Ready for what?
Your new chapter.
I don't have to get a new job,
do I?
Not yet, I'll let you know.
Okay, thank you.
So, just out of curiosity,
what exactly are we fixing?
You gonna get that?
You didn't answer my question.
I... I'll just...
Wait, what?
Did you...
Why did you text Renee?
I wanna meet her.
Dinner?
That's not happening,
she's not coming over here.
Okay, chill.
Why not?
Because...
Because...
Because it's just not gonna
happen, okay?
You said "because" three times
and I still don't get it.
Is this what you call
fixing things?
You can't just storm
into people's lives
and start messing things up.
Oh.
Chicken.
Chicken!
Look, you still haven't answered
my question.
- What are we fixing?
- You didn't answer mine.
I think you like her.
I think you like her a lot.
I saw the way you look at her.
She's not coming.
Period.
Where are you going?
To bed.
You're gonna roll up
your sleeves,
start chopping
and stop driving me crazy.
Sh!
We had a deal.
Lasagna.
Youtube's gonna be
your best friend.
Hey.
You're Sarah's father?
Can I help you?
I called in the accident.
I'm not the guy
you want to talk to.
But I got something
I gotta tell you.
Well, if it's about the accident
I don't want to hear it.
Andre saved Sarah.
He dragged her out of the water,
she was unconscious.
All I did was call 9-1-1.
Hey.
Look.
I'm sorry, I should've told you
this before.
Where were you?
Hiding.
I stole this two hours
before the accident.
What about the driver?
Angelina Goodwin.
The girl that
was driving the car,
- what happened to her?
- I don't know, I didn't see her.
- What are you doing?
- Aren't you going to arrest me?
Pick up the bag.
Pick it up.
You know where
to take that right?
Don't get lost on the way there.
Hey.
Thank you.
Hey.
Can I give you a lift?
I got a ride.
How about taking
the rest of the day off?
I got school.
I've got work.
Maybe we can cruise up
to the lake,
put the boat in the water,
go fishing.
Call it a family emergency.
I, uh, think I have to
return this first.
I think we can arrange that.
So be honest.
I am, it's good.
- Yeah?
- I'm serious.
I am studying YouTube
like the Bible.
It shows.
I'm leaving.
Oh.
Good.
I'm going back to Texas.
When?
August.
Got offered full time.
You want some more wine?
No, I'm fine.
Well, you haven't had any, so.
Where is she?
I'm gonna go get her.
Just let her sleep,
it's fine.
No, it's rude she said
she wanted to meet you.
Dean.
I'm still here.
Angie.
Angie.
Renee is here,
are you going to join us?
Fifteen more minutes.
Should probably give her another
30 minutes.
She's got jet lag so.
Please, sit.
How did she get in anyway?
Through the window
like a little bird.
No, she used the key that
you left under the doormat.
Perfect timing.
Are you okay, Dean?
I'm just happy for you.
Hey look, I...
I should probably go before
I say something I shouldn't.
Renee.
What is it?
Just talk to me.
You don't talk to me.
Every time I try you just...
push me away, even now.
I don't mean to.
I swear, it's just...
I just want you to be happy.
I don't want you
to lose out on life.
Why because you feel like
you missed out on yours?
What if you make me happy?
We don't have to
talk about this now.
Tell me.
Just tell me and I'll...
I'll never bother you again.
Tell you what?
That you don't love me.
That's just the wine talking.
Do you want me to call you
a cab?
You only hear the wine talking.
Okay.
I lied.
There is no job.
I'm leaving because...
I want to help a girl I know.
She fell in love with a man
then made her laugh and cry
and sometimes...
made her angry and sad.
But deep down in her heart
he made her happy.
And she wanted to give this
happiness back to him but...
for some reason
he didn't want to take it.
So when she found out
she was gonna have his child
she didn't say anything to him.
Just quietly flew away
somewhere far.
Did you hear all that?
I should probably run after her,
shouldn't I?
Renee!
Renee.
Call me back please.
I'm sorry.
Let's walk.
Did she remind you of Katie?
Why do you call everyone
by their first name?
Why not?
I call you Dean,
that's your name right.
But you call Martin "Grandpa."
That's true.
That's interesting.
I don't know why that is.
Me and Katie were very young
when we had you,
we hardly even knew each other.
How did it happen?
Sylvia never told you?
No.
When you were six
I just went my way
and she went hers.
One day she took the wrong turn.
Like me.
I've been having these dreams.
I see this white house
somewhere on top of a mountain.
She's standing outside
and when she sees me she smiles.
And she says,
"Come home.
It's time."
That's when I wake up.
And for a moment I feel like...
like it's not a dream.
It's real.
What if...
what if she's alive?
She's your guardian angel.
She's looking after you
every moment of every day.
Come here.
Sylvia was right.
I did run away.
And I blamed the whole world
for my sad little life.
That I didn't become a composer
and that I had a kid too young
and Katie's accident.
And I thought that if I run away
that it would fix things.
It didn't.
And when...
And the thought of losing you,
it opened up my eyes
and made me realize
that the whole time
the only person
that I was running from was me.
I am so sorry.
And I love you so much.
Look at me.
I love you, Dad.
Hey, where are you going?
- I'm gonna talk to her.
- Who?
- Renee.
- This is crazy!
You don't even know
where she lives.
I'm gonna fix everything!
Hello?
Dad?
- Dean.
- Yeah.
Uh, what time is it?
I'm sorry.
No, it's all right.
What's going on?
- Any news?
- No, no.
Okay, please call me
if you hear something.
Yeah.
Everything all right?
Yeah, yeah,
I'm sorry I woke you up.
I'll talk to you later.
No, that's all right.
W... whoa... De...
She's there, Martin,
I know it.
Well, if she was there
he'd tell us, honey.
No he wouldn't.
Yeah he would.
After all who are we?
We're not his parents,
we're not close friends.
We're nobody.
It's like this huge
dark cloud is above us
without ever letting
the sun inside our home.
And I don't know why,
I don't know
what we've done to deserve this.
Sh, Sylvie.
Don't do that.
Sylvie.
Sylvie, what are you...
Sylvie, what are you doing?
What do you think I'm doing?
Oh, come on.
Look, just don't do this
to yourself.
Just come back to bed.
Don't tell me what to do,
Martin.
When did you
ever listen to anything
I ever told you to do?
You never did.
Certainly not when we...
you shut the door on
our son and I let you do it.
Shouldn't have done that.
We should've done everything
in our power to help him.
To help him achieve
whatever dreams he had
but we didn't do that, did we?
No.
Maybe that's why he doesn't
consider us his friends
or his family.
We're what's dark around here.
We're the cloud.
- So much better.
- Gotta eat more than me,
I'm getting a belly.
Morning.
Mark made waffles.
Do you want some?
I'm not hungry.
Do you want some eggs?
Where are you going?
- My room.
- Can you please come
sit here with us?
So I can listen to you
whining at me, no thanks.
- Sarah, don't go there.
- Where?
I can't use my phone,
I can't go to my room.
I can't talk to my boyfriend,
now I can't even talk.
Ladies, please
let's just take it easy.
RJ's nice, Mommy.
Why don't you like him?
Is it because he's black.
Eat your waffles, Bobby.
Sarah!
Where'd she go?
Sarah!
Oh my god,
you gotta be kidding me!
- What happened?
- Terry, Sarah's gone.
She took my car and she left.
I don't know,
probably to see her boyfriend.
I want you to be her father.
That boy is bad news.
No he's... Okay, call me back.
I just... I don't know.
So this social work thing,
what is it?
It's a good thing, Dad.
It's a way to help make
people's lives better.
God makes people's lives better.
Well, maybe sometimes
he sends someone to help them.
So this Jane Addams University,
is it any good?
Best in the country.
And they really pay
for your full tuition?
If I get the
Presidential Scholarship, yes.
Sounds too good to be true.
Hey.
I have a late pickup tonight
so I'll probably see you
tomorrow.
Okay.
Selena.
Your father wanted me
to give you this.
Your mom told me
you might be here.
Great.
Now she knows too.
Knows what?
I know how it looks.
I come in the middle of the
night after all this happened,
but her mom wasn't going to
let me in the front door.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Where is she?
Sarah?
She's not at home?
No, she took her mom's car,
drove off.
What?
Where?
I was hoping you could tell me.
Well.
Great.
I guess she didn't tell you
either.
No.
What happened, like where
would she go with her car?
If anybody would have a clue,
that'd be you.
All right, look.
Just call me on my cellphone
if you hear from her, okay.
Not at the station, my cell.
Follow the butterfly.
Fairytale Garden!
She's at the Fairytale Garden,
I know it!
Where is it?
I know exactly where it is.
Renee?
Hey.
Glad I found you.
What do you want, Dean?
I just built up this wall
of excuses of why
it wouldn't work
between us and...
I don't want to do that anymore.
Do you remember
when we first met?
We were sitting next
to each other at school.
We had that um...
long, silly conversation
just pretending to be teenagers
drinking milk and cookies.
I...
I love you.
I love you so much.
Dean.
You're a horrible salesman.
Hey, did she ever
come to see you?
Have you been out
all this time looking for her?
And you.
Yeah?
Yeah, she's right here
in front of me eating.
Fine.
Okay, we will be there,
uh, I don't know,
give me 30 minutes
and I'll bring her by.
Okay.
Jeez.
Uh, Angie's grandmother
would like to talk to you.
About?
I don't know, she didn't say.
I'm not going to go over
to that house.
That woman, she's wretched.
Well, that woman is your mother.
Well, it's easy for you to say.
You don't have
to live with her anymore.
Sure, but I accept her
for who she is.
You're going to have to do
that too.
No, I don't.
She doesn't accept me.
If it was me,
I would go over there anyway
just to prove a point,
take a stand,
make her accept me for who I am,
respect me.
But that's just me.
And how would I do that?
Take Andre with you.
Well will you
stop looking for her?
When we find her.
What if you never find her?
Then we never stop looking.
He's coming.
Good.
Angie?
Angie?
Are you there?
You know, Bobby's a good looking
kid, where is he?
He's with Mark at his mothers.
You have some nerve.
Showing up here with him.
Best buds, I bet.
Yeah, as a matter a fact we are.
And you probably should too.
Especially when you find out
that he is the one
who saved our daughter's life.
- What?
- Yeah.
The bruises that he has,
they're not from the accident.
They're from his busting out
the window
so that he could pull Sarah
out of the water to safety.
That's what happened.
Terry don't, just...
Go for Detective Knight.
I love you so much.
She wrote this.
Angie, wrote this.
It's called Angel.
I have something for you.
Sarah.
You don't have to tell me
where she is
just tell me she's okay.
Does she need money?
Nobody has to know.
What?
Ugh.
Really?
Honey, is she okay?
Okay.
Ah.
Thanks for the update.
She came to see you.
Hello?
Sylvie, I found her passport.
I'm holding it in my hands.
It was underneath her bed.
Oh, Martin.
I never left the key
under your doormat, Dean.
I had it the entire time.
What are you saying?
They found Angie's body.
What?
The current had dragged it
13 miles from the crash site.
No.
Oh my god, no.
I guess it's pretty sad to think
that my story ends here.
It doesn't.
No one remembers
the last time it snowed
in Garden Land, Florida.
I guess I'm a little
overwhelmed too
and at the same time,
very excited.
Today, I am turning 18.
I waited for this moment
all my life.
I can finally do
all those things
I always dreamed about.
I can take a vacation
anywhere in the world.
I can buy fireworks.
Go skydiving.
I can even buy
my own lottery ticket.
But when you're a superhero
you don't need
any of those things.
Believe me.
When you can fly
and be invisible,
all your human wishes
become boring.
I guess you want to know
if I saved the world.
Angie Goodwin.
I knew it was you.
What?
What's in the chart?
How clever.
Don't worry.
My lips are sealed.
Of course it was you.
We do not slam doors
in this house.
- The door's wide open.
- Then who did it?
I don't know who did it, okay.
A ghost did it.
And then you appeared out
of nowhere.
Told me you were going to
teach my dad a lesson.
I thought I was going to do
the hotel to pick up
but they sent me to the airport.
I don't know,
someone changed it.
I knew you were behind it.
I followed the butterflies
because I knew
that I'd find you here.
This will always be
our Fairytale Garden.
I kept my promise.
What about you?
When are you coming home?
Ever since I was a little girl
I had this dream.
One day, I become a superhero
in my very own fairytale.
I can fly, be invisible
and at the end,
save the world.
My world.
People that are closest
and dearest to my heart.
You know what?
I got away with it.
I hope one day you will too.
And to answer Sylvia's question.
Ask Renee.
