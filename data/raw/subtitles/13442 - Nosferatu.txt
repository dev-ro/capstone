Chronicle of the Great Death
in Wisborg
Anno Domini 1838, by...
NOSFERATU.
Does this word not sound to you
like the midnight cry of the Deathbird.
Take care in saying it,
lest life's images fade into shadows,
and ghostly dreams rise from
your heart and nourish themselves
on your blood.
Long have I contemplated
the origin and recession
of the Great Death
in my hometown of Wisborg.
Here is its story:
There lived in Wisborg
Hutter and his young wife Ellen.
Why did you kill them...
the lovely flowers...?!
Not so fast, my young friend!
No-one outruns his destiny.
There was also a property agent
by the name of Knock-
the subject of all
sorts of rumours.
One thing was certain:
He paid his people well.
Count Orlok - His Lordship...
from Transylvania...
wishes to acquire a beautiful
home in our little town...
You could earn a nice
bit of money...
of course the price is
a little effort... some sweat
and perhaps... a little blood...
He wants a fine,
deserted house...
That house...
directly across from yours.
Offer him that one!
Travel quickly, travel well,
my young friend,
into the land of the spectres.
I'm travelling far, far away
into the land of thieves
and spectres.
So Hutter placed the anguished girl
in the care of his friends,
the rich shipowner Harding
and his sister.
Be at ease.
And young Hutter travelled
many dusty roads,
but at last the peaks
of the Carpathians
loomed before him.
The horses strained harder.
Quickly... something to eat -
I have to get to
Count Orlok's castle!
You shouldn't go any further now;
The Werewolf roams the woods.
Of Vampyres
Gastlie Spirits, Bewitchments
and the Seven Deadlie Sins.
From Belial's seed sprang
the vampyre NOSFERATU,
who doth live and feed
on the bloode of humankind -
Beyonde deliverance he doth
dwell in gastlie caves,
sepulchres and coffins,
filled so with god-curst earth
from the fields
of the Black Death.
Of Vampyres
Gastlie Spirits, Bewitchments
and the Seven Deadlie Sins.
Onward! The sun is setting!
Offer what you like!
We're not going any further!
We won't go on!
It's frightening beyond the pass!
No sooner had Hutter
stepped across the bridge,
than the eerie visions
he had often told me about
seized hold of him.
You have kept me waiting.
Waiting too long.
Now it is nearly midnight.
The servants are sleeping!
End of the 1st Act.
Nosferatu 2nd Act.
You have hurt yourself...
Precious blood!
Shouldn't we like to sit
together a bit, dear friend?
It is a while still till sunrise -
and in the daytime I sleep,
my dear fellow, I sleep
the deepest of sleeps -
Just as the sun rose,
the shadows of the night
withdrew from Hutter as well.
My dear! My dearest!
Grieve not that thy beloved
is so far away.
I am plagued by mosquitoes.
I already have two bites
on my throat,
one quite near the other,
on each side.
One dreams so heavily
in this desolate castle,
but fear not.
The spectral evening light
seemed to revive the shadows
of the castle once more.
Your wife has a lovely neck...
I shall buy the house...
The fine, deserted house
opposite yours...
At night this same Nosferatu
doth clutch his victim
and doth suck like hellish
life-potion its blood.
Take heede that his shadow
not encumber thee
like an incubus with
gruesome dreams.
At the same hour.
A doctor... a doctor!
Harmless congestions
of the blood.
The doctor related
Ellen's distress to me
as an unknown illness.
I know, however, that
her soul that night
caught the cry of
the Deathbird -
Nosferatu was already
spreading his wings. -
Yet with the morning light
Hutter set out
to make sense of
the horror of his nights. -
The raftsmen didn't know
what kind of unholy cargo
they were conveying
through the dale.
End of the 2nd Act.
Nosferatu 3rd Act.
He was brought to the hospital
yesterday by some farmers.
They said he must have
fallen. He's still feverish...
Coffins -
Nosferatu was on his way.
The danger for Wisborg drew nigh.
The Paracelsian
Professor Bulwer,
who at that time was
studying the secrets of nature
and their deepest
unifying principles,
told me the following:
Earth-filled coffins
were to be loaded
onto the double-masted
ship, the Empusa.
The vessel's still set
for sail tonight.
Bill of Lading: EMPUSA.
Route: From GALAZ to WISBORG.
Cargo: 6 crates of earth
(experimental purposes)
In those days, I should note,
Prof. Bulwer was explaining
to his students the cruel habits
of carnivorous plants.
They observed in horror
nature's mysterious ways.
Like a vampire - isn't it?
It seems that the approach
of the strangler, Nosferatu,
already compelled the
property agent Knock
into his shadow.
The patient admitted
yesterday is going mad...
Blood is life! Blood is life!!!!
And this one here...
a polyp with tentacles...
transparent...
almost incorporeal...
almost but a phantom...
Spiders...!
Ellen was often seen
on the beach
within the solitude
of the dunes.
Yearning for her beloved,
her eyes scanned
waves and distance alike.
My dear! My dearest!
Grieve not that thy beloved
is so far away.
I am plagued by mosquitoes.
I already have two bites
on my throat,
one quite near the other,
on each side.
One dreams so heavily
in this desolate castle,
but fear not.
No I must go...
by the shortest route home!!!
PLAGUE. A plague epidemic
has broken out
in Transylvania and
the Black Sea ports
of Varna and Galaz.
All victims exhibit the same
peculiar stigmata on the neck,
the origin of which still
puzzles the doctors.
The Dardanelles were
closed to all ships
suspected of carrying
the plague.
A sailor's fallen ill below deck.
He's delirious.
It spread through the ship
like an epidemic.
The first stricken sailor
pulled the entire crew
after him into the dark
grave of the waves.
In the light of the sinking sun,
the captain and ship's mate
bid farewell to the last
of their comrades.
I'm going below!!! If I'm
not back up in ten minutes...
The ship of death had
acquired its new captain.
End of the 3rd Act.
Nosferatu 4th Act.
It's quite difficult to say how,
despite his depleted strength,
young Hutter succeeded
in surmounting the obstacles
on his voyage home -
meanwhile, Nosferatu's
deadly breath
swelled the sails of the ship,
which flew on toward its
destination with ghostly haste.
I must go to him. He's coming!!!
The master is near...
The master is near...!
Long have I pondered
why Nosferatu was said
to have travelled with
earth-filled coffins.
I found it recorded
that vampyres
can only draw their
shadowy strength
from the accursed earth
in which they were buried.
Thank God... you're safe...
All's well now...
Looked over everything...
Not a living soul on board.

PROCLAMATION.
It is hereby decreed that

the populace to transport
the ill or plague-stricken
to the hospital,
lest the plague
spread through the streets.
End of the 4th Act.
Nosferatu 5th Act.
Hutter made Ellen swear
not to touch the book
which had frightened him
with its visions. -
Yet she could not resist
its bizarre attraction.
At night this same Nosferatu
doth clutch his victim
and doth suck like hellish
life-potion its blood.
Take heede that his shadow
not encumber thee
like an incubus with
gruesome dreams.
Wherefore no other
salvation is possible,
but that a maiden
wholly without sin
maketh the Vampyre forget
the first crow of the cock.
Would that she give
freely of her blood.
This is what I see -
each evening...!!!
Fear lurked in every
corner of the town.
Who was still well?
Who already ill?
I'll run over there quickly...
I'll fetch Sievers...
Wherefore no other
salvation is possible,
but that a maiden
wholly without sin
maketh the Vampyre forget
the first crow of the cock.
Would that she give
freely of her blood.
The panic-stricken town
was looking for a victim:
It was Knock.
Someone saw him! He ran outside!
He strangled the custodian...
He strangled him... the vampire!
I LOVE YOU.
Bulwer! Fetch Bulwer!
Knock has been captured!
The master... the master...!
The master... is... dead.
Witness the miracle
on the heels of the truth:
At that very hour,
the Great Death came to an end,
and as if confronted by the
victorious radiance of
the living sun,
the shadow of the Deathbird
was dispersed.
THE END.
