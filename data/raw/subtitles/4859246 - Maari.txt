I joined police services in this area station five years back.
Many sub-inspectors have come and gone in this period.
But you are the first S.I...
Who has voluntarily enquired about this case.That too on your first day.
It’s good…
…but I am telling you out of concern.
It’s better to maintain a low profile here.
This is a nasty area.
And the case you are talking about...
...it is not even registered.
That murder is just a rumour, sir.
Just came to my ear, through the grapevine.
It’s okay.
I like rumours better than the truth.
Tell me.
They say it happened eight years back.
A lot of pigeon racing happens in this area.
There is talk that this murder was a result of one of those fights.
Pigeon racing? What’s that?
You’ve never heard about it?
It’s very common in Chennai, sir.
But no one seems to know about it.
There are two types of pigeon racing, sir.
One. Homing pigeon.
Each participant enters about five to ten pigeons, sir.
The day before the race…
…participants bring their pigeons to the club.
Each of the pigeons are given tags.
A secret numbered ring is fixed to the pigeon’s leg.
Then all pigeons are transported through a lorry or train.
Depending on the race distance…
…they select a town.
Like Nellore, Bhopal, Delhi.
All the cages are lined up there.
And all the pigeons are released at once!
No matter how far away you take it...
It flies right back to its owner’s place!
The pigeon that reaches first wins the race.
The other kind is Tumbler tournament.
Tumblers can perform somersaults while flying.
Pigeon fanciers have a lot of respect for it.
They host the tournaments fairly.
They don’t allow gambling in these tournaments.
But there is a lot of competition and rivalry.
There is talk that the murder you’re asking abouthappened during one such issue.
Who did it?
There is this guy called “Coal” Velu, sir.
You might have heard.
This entire area is under his control, sir.
He exports red sanders illegally, sir.
Even he’s been a pigeon fancier for years.
The killer was from his gang.
A twenty two year old boy!
He wasn’t even a gangster back then.
Just a boy who raised pigeons.
He used to look after Velu anna’s racing pigeons.
One night, a guy from the opponent’s gang…
…slit his favourite pigeon’s throat.
That was it!
And he killed a man who was feared until then.
This boy went and stabbed him to death in blind rage.
He was just a boy who raised pigeons until then.
They say he's reached a whole new level since then!
That was eight years back.
He's the big-gun in the hood these days.
We can't even lay a finger on him, sir.
What did you say his name was?
Maari!
Velu anna has many areas under his control.
He handed one of those areas to Maari.
His cut reaches him promptly every month.
Velu anna’s main business is smuggling red sanders.
It’s the top illegal business in Chennai and Andhra these days.
A tonne of red sanders can fetch upto a million at the foreign market.
Velu anna has too many cases filed against him.
And even more enemies.
So he doesn’t get out much.
He handles all deals through Maari.
There’s another man under Velu called “Bird” Ravi.
He wants to be a part of Velu’s business;
But Velu’s support is for Maari.
Velu doesn’t get involved in Maari’s jurisdiction.
Nothing happens at odds with him.
Want to pay up nicely?Or should I smash your shop up?
They’re robbing us under broad daylight!
Is there no one to fight them?
Poor thing has been boiling in the sun, his feet swollen!
He’s asking so sweetly.
You’re asking to be beaten?
Call yourself a gangster?
Koochie-kooing with him!
Can’t beat him up and get it?
He's a ruffian.
When he gets angry…
…everyone around him flees.
But when he’s with his pigeons…
You can see his other side.
He immediately becomes kind!
This bad guy appears to be a good guy…
…when he’s with the pigeons.
For ages, Velu was hosting these tournaments.
Then he left Maari in charge.
Despite a lot of illegal business…
…he’s very honest when it comes to pigeons.
He conducts these tournaments supervised by senior fanciers.
If someone cheats, he gets very angry.
He stops being kind. Hard to deal with him then!
Do the people in the area like him?
No. Not at all!
His only friends are boys who raise pigeons.
The people are really pissed off with him!
He’s a naughty fellow, sir.
He causes trouble just for the fun of it.
Keeps causing some problem or the other for everyone.
He went to get his hair trimmed one day.
He waltzed straight into the seat, not awaiting his turn.
One customer who was already waiting…
…just stopped Maari and sat down.
That was it! They just shaved him bald!
At least this guy only lost his hair.
There was a cricket match playing one day…
He got fully drunkand was watching the match at a T.V showroom.
One ball- Three runs. How is it possible?
It was a World Cup semi-final match.
Unfortunately for them, India lost!
Oh my God!
Oh no! India has lost.
Shopguy! Come out.
There are so many T.Vs here.
How come India didn’t win in even one of the T.Vs?
Why didn’t they win?- Don’t hit me, Maari.
Why didn’t they win?
Smash every single T.V, Maari!
Don’t break it!
Move, I want to break a T.V too!
He doesn’t even leave the children alone.
What trouble does he cause children?
Hey, come here. -Yes, brother?
Go!
How was that?
Does he at least treat his boys well?
He has a boy called Robert.
His nickname is “Punching bag”.
He just summons the “Punching bag” from wherever, just to bash him up;
Only then does he cool down.
Why have the beer prices gone up?
Why?
Why have you raised it?
Why is it so sunny?
Why is it sunny?
Why do you wake me up when I’m asleep?
I can only awaken a sleeping person!
You’re retorting? Huh?
Why didn’t you wake me up? I asked you, right?
How could they give the last over to Ashish Nehra?
How could they? How could they?
There’s another loafer who hangs out with Maari.
His name is Saturday.
Saturday? What kind of a name is that?
Come Saturday, I compulsorily drink.
So you don’t drink on other days?
I do drink!
So just not compulsorily on other days?
No! Dirty fellow.
I definitely drink on other days, too.
Then why is your name Saturday?
Come Saturday, I compulsorily drink.
He’s scratching his head; He’s confused. Good.
This Saturday selects people from the area…
…and organizes a song and dance show for Maari.
He brings everyone by force and makes them sing and dance!
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Such a warm evening.-Meaning?
I’m really proud of you!
I’m very happy to see you all.
Tonight, special program by Mr. Maari Boys Team!
Proudly presents the game of “Laugh or Die”.
What’s “Laugh or Die”?
You perform, and if Maari doesn’t laugh, you die!
Shut up!
Call this dancing?
What’s he doing?
Move your hips!
There! Face Maari.
Face them! Face them when you dance.
Not good! Bring on the next.
Stand in your position.
Dance properly!
More heavy.
What's this?!
Look at this. Look at this baby’s performance.
Bloody idiot! Dance like this.
All this happens.
But we can’t do anything.
That’s how much he’s feared.
There was a tournament even yesterday.
Maari won the cup, as always.
Can’t control the rave in the area today!
His name- Prominent
This guy- He's different
He paves new routes
With his steel heart he rules
His soul knows no guilt;No order.
No guilt and no order in him!
He's seen all maladies;And misery.
He has seen it all.
Maari…
He's the good one - He's Maari!The dashing one - Maari
Maari…
Rub him and he's gold, this MaariSnub him and he's a beast, this Maari
Maari…
Doesn't know the world;
Doesn't heed law and order.
Doesn't like to change his ways;
Doesn't have time for love.
Don't try threatening him;
He is a solo contestant.
Don't you dare pick on him;
He's a ruthless opponent.
Today’s Boss Velu’s birthday.
I’ll kill you if there’s a bad show at “Laugh or Die”.
I’ve got a special item here for Boss!-Yuck!
Feels light weight.
Look!
What’s it?-It’s an item you’ll like.
Hey, come out.
Who’s he?
Product name: Anirudh.
Ani…?-Rudh!
What does he do?-He plays!
He plays music and sings well, it seems.
Perform for us.
I need some instruments, man.-Get him those instruments.
Why?
Cool. Cool!
Not necessary. Just sing and dance.
Okay, I’ll do it.
Careful!
Eww!
What’s he wearing?
Look at his cap and glasses!
Get him changed.
Let’s go, dear.-Lift him!
Bro, I’ll come on my own.
We should just let him be…
…mind our jobs and be safe.
Sir, where are we going?
Take the vehicle to Maari’s area.
I’ve got information that betting is taking place at the pigeon tournament today.
We’ll catch him red handed.
But, sir.
We shouldn’t even enter there without his permission, sir.
Are we the police or is he? Start the jeep.
Hey, you are banned this year, right?
What are you doing here? Just leave.
I just came to watch. Can’t I watch?
Just leave.
Sir, he tumbled once!
Bro, was that okay?-That was okay, son.
What? Why is it descending already?
Looks like he won’t make it!
Who’s that auntie?
You’re pretending to flail your cloth;Making the bird fly away!
I don’t even know that woman. Must be a neighbour.
Lady, don’t know about the tournament? Dry your clothes elsewhere.
Hit him!
He’s lying. That’s his wife.
You’ve set her up?- No, brother.
Why would you set-up your own wife?
Is she your wife or a set-up?
Note that down! That his bird has lost.
Don’t do that, sir!
You cheat!
How come I hear a jeep in here?
It’s them, sir.
Where is Maari?
Look at that!
Firstly, you shouldn’t have walked in without our permission.
And you have the guts to ask for Maari?
I’ve got information that betting happens here.
Betting?
The jeep belongs in Chepauk!
Must have lost its way and ended up here.
We’re just letting the pigeons fly and looking at the skies…
…He uses big words like “gambling”!
You can’t organise such tournaments without police permission.
Stop everything. I need to see Maari.
Clear the crowd!
What’s the noise?
Stop crowding the place, go!
Just leave, now.
Did you ask for protection?
No, Maari.
Then what’s the officer doing here?
A cop's job is where the rowdies are.
Rowdies?
We’re flying the symbol of peace and you call us rowdies?
This is something we do for the pride; It’s not a gamble.
Some enemy of mine has told you lies about me.
Only a man who does wrong will have enemies.
You should leave, sir.
Won’t be nice if we forced you out.
Your threats won’t scare me.
I’ve got evidence.
Just stop everything and co-operate to the investigation.
Evidence?
Evidence…
Hey!
Come here, boy.
He won’t hit you! Come.
Come!
Come here.
Listen.
You got into a mess when you cheated last year.
I banned you this year because you can’t pay up the entry fees.
But you shouldn’t go to the officer and tell him lies about me!
You tell us.
Does something illegal happen here?-Let him go.
Talk to me. – Wait, I’ll ask and tell.
Tell him!
Does anything illegal happen?
Tell, does anything illegal happen?
Just tell him.
Sir, let’s just leave, sir!
Didn’t he say nothing illegal happens here?
Leave.
Let’s leave, sir. Come, sir!
Who is he?
The new sub-inspector in the area, Maari.
Little bugs seem to be getting ideas now.
I’ll finish them off!
Shall we go, sir?
You should leave, sir.
Won’t be nice if we forced you out.
Sir?
Stop brooding over it, sir.
What can we do?
He’s backed by many.
We will have to adjust a little.
Not just you; All the policemen.
I’m not like all the policemen, Arumugam.
He’s known to have committed a murder.
If we still can’t lock him up; What’s the point in being a policeman?
How can we act upon rumours?
It’s still a rumour because everyone let it be that way.
Someone told you this rumour.
Someone else told him.
If we follow the trail, it won’t be hearsay.
We’ll find the origin.
We start tomorrow.
With you.
And connect it all the way to Maari.
Mom!
Mom!
You said you’ll buy me a new bag, mom!
I’m struggling to make ends meet.
You want a new bag?
Use the one you already have.
It’s torn, mom!
Everyone in school makes fun.
I’ll stitch it tomorrow. Use it for now.
Always nagging me!
I won’t go to school if you don’t get me a new bag.
Don’t go, then. What do I care?
Bugging me in the mornings!
Please, mom!
Loudspeaker Kavitha!
I’m pissed off already. Don’t start.
Look at that!
Your yelling woke me up in the morning.
And now you’re pissed?
You don’t even have a sweet voice.
First thing in the morning, you yell “Mom, mom!”
Look, mom! He’s always making fun of me.
You know he’s pulling your leg. Why do you care?
You’re getting late. Go on!
This has become a routine!
Why make fun of the child in the mornings?
What were you doing, then?
You weren’t coddling either!
She only wants a bag. Can’t buy one?
Where do I get the money?
If your husband doesn’t drink for two days,you’ll get the money.
You talk so much, why can’t you buy her one?
I would have bought it if you’d married me.
You missed your chance.
Look at that face!
Maari.
Did someone tell you they’re moving into door number 8?
No. No one told me.  Why?
Then someone has moved in without our permission.
I said stop.
Painting without permission….
Stop it, I say!
No respect for a gangster!
Move aside, Lady.
Oh, sorry. It’s a mannequin.
Why are you just standing there? Here, hang this.- Okay, ma'am.
She asked me to hang this against the wall.
Why not her face?
Taking orders from a woman!We’re gangsters, man!
What is this?
Think you can just move in herewithout permission?
Who are you? Why should I tell you?
Whatever happens in the area,happens only with Maari's permission.
Got it, white bro?
Are you doing rowdyism?
I was doing comedy till now.
Now I am doing rowdyism.
Here, this is rowdyism.
Please!
That house broker never told us anything about this.
He said he told you.
No, sir! When did you tell us?
Not to you, sir.- Then?
I told her, sir.
Slap you!
Hey Maari, control yourself!
It’s morning time.
Think you can touch me?
Had you not been a woman, I’d have ruined you.
No. Don’t ruin my daughter.
Poor thing, she made a mistake.
She keeps talking...
...what did we do wrong?
We only did our duty, right?
Did the broker tell you anything?
Yes.
Why didn’t you tell us anything?
Mom. Why should we pay them up?
It seems I need to pay them extra to open a boutique.
So mother and daughter are planning to open a petty shop here?
No. Not a petty shop. Boutique.
Mom. Why are you explaining all this to them?
Look here.
Break your finger! Drop it.
This is my house.
I’ll do as I wish. Okay?
Look here.
Keep your petty shop.
Or keep a cloth store.
Keep him if you want.- Yes!
Keep whatever you want!
But who’ll give you protection for all that?
Give us our cut, and keep whatever you want.
Protection? For what?
What will happen here?-Anything could happen.
This glass could fall and shatter.
Saw that?
That cupboard could topple and break.-Don’t do that, sir.
Something lighter, please!
Right. Okay, the T.V.
Don’t break the T.V.
Dear, just give them the money.
This covers the house, who’ll pay for the petty shop?
Boutique!
You’ll have to pay double for English names.
I don’t have cash in hand.
Give us some time, we’ll pay up.
One week.
Dad! I'm going to the police.
It's the police station we're going to next;For our "collection".
It's a funny girl, Maari!
The way you were staring at her, I was happy.I thought you were in love!
What? Love?
For the first time, I felt like slapping a girl.
I have a principle against hitting women.So I let it go.
We’ve seen in so many Tamil movies…
…The heroine swears in slow motion;The hero takes it with a smile on his face
And they fall in love.
How can you fall in love when a woman is yelling at your face.
I’d rather catch chikungunya than fall in love.
Then my route is clear.- What?
No, I meant this is the route to go.
That girl talks too much, keep her under control.
Shift. Shift.
Move it up.
Okay, fix it.
How is it?-Super
Look, mom.
Hey, where are you guys? Come here.- Be quiet, don’t yell.
Yes, leave it there.
Don’t shake it. Fix it like that.
Hello. Why are you keeping this here?
We keep it here every year.
It’s our lucky spot.
How do we enter then?
Lie down and crawl inside.
Being nice because you’re an old guy. Go.
Hey! How dare you stare at me like that?
What is this?
Staring at me, dear?
Must be crazy.-What are you staring at?
You tie it up, brother.
Hi, Veeran Nagar.
Got electrocuted?-Why?
Okay, we’ll do it my way.
Maari Boys are hosting 11th Annual Tumbler Pigeon and High Flyer Pigeon Competition.
We’re having a prize distribution.
When we call out your name, come collect your prizes.
One important thing...
Some people fly their pigeons every year just for the consolation prizes.
We’ve got some vessels for you.You can collect them and go.
Medals, bro.-Whatever, give it to them.
Maari is here. Applause!
Maari and the oldies will greet each other.
The first prize goes to Maari’s pigeon as usual.
As we’re hosting it we’ll be magnanimous.
But the oldies still want to honour Maari.
Clap! Louder!
After all those foreign medicines, all we get is the consolation prize?
This Maari does something special.
Our birds have no value in the market.
Even people from Delhi and Calcutta want Maari’s birds.
We’ll change everything tomorrow.
Next up, for the consolation prize, come on stage “Bird” Ravi.
You go get it.
Hey, you’re “Bird” Ravi right? You should come up.
I’ll come.
Put it on his head.
That’s enough.
“Bird” Ravi wishes to organise a Tumbler-High Flyer tournament tomorrow.
Nothing happens outside your control. Hence…
It only works if one person does it.
If there’s some problem...
Maari’s name is at stake for granting permission.
You’re the host, you’re the winner...
...what do we do, Maari?
What are you trying to say? That we win because we host?
Not like that.
You’ll win anyway.
At least we’ll have the pride of hosting it.
It will boost our pigeon’s market value.
Earlier, “Bird” Ravi’s pigeons had some value.
Now everyone comes after only your pigeons.
We’re asking this as a favour.
We’ve got the money and the manpower to host it.
We’ll give you your share of the entry fees.
You can participate, you don’t have to pay an entry fee.
Wow! What an offer. Very generous.
No Maari. I said it like it is.
Hosting or paying is not the matter here.
You should maintain the sanctity of the tournament.  That’s important.
We’ll handle all that, Maari. You should give us a chance once.
Okay. Let’s give it a shot.
Thanks, Maari.
But we’re not flying our birds.
Why, Maari?
You said we always win it.
Why piss you off?
No, Maari. We’ll be very proud if your pigeon wins in our tournament.
When did I tell you about the murder? Stop babbling.
You told me right here, the other night.
Are you out of your mind?
You’re enquiring about him here?
Sir, I just blurted some nonsense, sir.
It was the “Tea Shop” Selva who told me.
Officer, I don’t know anything.
I might have believed you if you hadn’t spilt the tea.
Tell me the truth.
Some say it happened, some say it didn’t.
Who are these people?
This guy called Muthu, in the 2nd street.
Oh, that junkie?
The murder happened for real…
…during a gang war eight years back.
That’s all I know.
Everything we heard since morning is a waste.
This guy called Anbu; Father and son pick pockets.
Dad is old school, does a neat job.
But the son is a rookie.
Even last week got caught doing a job at the market.
The guy got away, but everyone saw his face.
His case is registered, we can use that to threaten him.
Eight years back, Maari committed a murder.
What do you know about it?
About Maari?
I don’t know anything.
Someone has given you false information.
So, shall we lock your son up?
Yeah, there is a case registered against him.
Answer them, dad.
What do you want to know about Maari?-Keep quiet!
Why are you scared?
What can he do to us?
Ask me, sir.
Answer bravely, no one will know about this.
Back then, Velu’s gang was not in power.
There was a man called Pandi.
He was the top gun.
Those two gangs never got along, sir.
One day, because of some issue...
They say Maari went and stabbed Pandi.
Then it turned into a gang war...
...and Pandi’s entire gang was wiped out.
Since then, Velu’s hold over the area became stronger.
Do you know anyone who witnessed the killing?
No sir.
I haven’t heard of anyone who witnessed Maari committing the murder.
The case wasn’t registered.
Then when Velu came to power, he wiped it clean.
How is that?
They have killed a man who was in power.
Maari became a gangster only after that.
The whole area is scared of him.
But no one knows who finished him, or how.
How would we know?
It never happened.
Think about it, sir…
A murder like this is a matter of pride for a gangster.
Then why is it still a rumour?
Because it never happened, sir.
He’s just building up, sir.
Don’t believe any of it.
Sri dear. Hello! Have you come to see Maari?
Why have you come with your mom?
Maari, petty shop is here with mummy.
Greetings, sir.
We didn’t know who you were.
We started on the wrong foot when we moved in.
We’ll pay you your fees.
Just give us some time.
We were wealthy back in Delhi.
Met a huge loss in business.
So we’re a little broke now.
We go broke too, spending on booze every night.
We just need some time.
I think he is still pissed with us.
We came to apologize.
Your daughter doesn’t look like it.
Say ‘sorry’.
Sorry.
I didn’t know who you were.
I misbehaved.
Now you know who he is.
How did you behave?
Angrily.
You were cheeky.
Yes. Cheeky.
And insolent.
Yes. I was insolent.
Like you were some big shot.
Yes. I acted like I was a big shot.
Don’t roll your eyes. They might pop out and fall down.
Look at that. It looks freaky.
Sorry.
I forgive you. Go.
Maari forgives you. Go.
So, can we pay the rest later?
No need to pay up.
I expected-- Thank you!
See, if you’re nice to the bosses, they’re helpful.
Instead, take me as a partner in your shop.
Unexpected!
Take me as a partner in your shop.
I’ll collect my remaining money that way.
Move.
What’s he saying? Partner?
It’s all good.
It’s not your shop anymore.
It’s our shop. Congrats.
It’s an auspicious day.
We’re partners henceforth. Okay?
Shake hands.
We call ourselves partners...
But how do we let the world know?
Look at that girl standing there.
Do something about it, Maari.
Change it.
“Punching Bag”, is this okay?-Not really.
Get lost.
Brother, this one?
Yeah, perfect.
No more porn for you!
Don’t mind them, just work.
Maari, customers are here, please –- Hey, guests are all here, bring coffee.
Get coffee!
Why is this girl dressed in a lungi?
This design is nice.
You’re a customer?
See, same piece.
It’s roomy, wear it. Very breezy.
Wait!
Don’t feel bad.
Who’s the referee for our loft?
Who else for Maari’s loft?
I’ll be coming.
Take care.- Okay, Maari.
Is the boy ready?
Want me to tell him about the missing birds?
You know about it?
Is this Maari’s loft?
Maari?
Say Maari annan.
Mister, who are you?- Your usual referee...
...has gone to another loft.
So they sent me here.
How can they do that? It’s wrong.Wait, I’ll call up “Bird” Ravi.
Is a tournament happening here?
Yes, Ravi his organizing it.
Who? “Bird” Ravi?
Has Maari lost his clout?
Look at that flip! That’s my boy.
What’s he scribbling?
It was a foul.
What? A foul?
He’s making such solid flips.Calling it a foul?
He tumbled correctly.
Are you kidding me? Look closely.
I’m warning you once…
If he does it wrong again, you’re out.
You’ll disqualify our pigeon?
Saturday.
Come on. Did you see that?
No, no, no.
His movements are erratic.
There is no form.
This one is disqualified.
This one has won contests in the last three years.
So what?
He did it wrong this year.
Disqualified.
I can’t bluff for you guys.
Who’s bluffing here?
Careful!
Stop. No fighting in the tournament.
You tell him oldie…
Don’t know to raise pigeons!
They just threaten us.
Oh, is that so? One minute.
Let those pigeons out.
Which is the Tumbler, and which is the High Flyer here?
Why?
Just tell me.
Here, this is the Tumbler.
With the way you looked up at the sky,
I could tell you were a fraud.
None of these are Tumblers.
I knew something was fishy when they sent a new guy instead of a neutral party.
You’d disqualify our pigeon..
..we protest, and you call Maari’s men cheats.Was that your plan?
See our product? Thirty years of experience. He caught you red handed.
It’s not that…
You said something a while back.
What?
Something about raising pigeons.
No, didn’t say anything.
I heard you.
Just say it.
If the pigeon had tumbled right, we’d have no problem…
Is that what he said?- I think so.
Ouch.
Am I deaf?
He said something else.
Tell him.
You said something a while back.
Say that.
I said you didn’t know to raise pigeons… but threatened…
I didn’t know… So I said…
How can you say without knowing?
So you’re saying my pigeon can’t tumble.
How should one tumble? You tell me.
It needs to fly up... and turn like that, and this way…
I don’t know how to explain it.
If you can’t explain, then demonstrate.
Wasn’t that a perfect somersault?-Yes, it was.
Not man enough to face me, but trying to plot a sketch.
I’ll finish him off.
This a petty issue, why should you waste time on this?
What’s a petty issue?
Would you be quiet if someone hits your guy?
I wouldn’t have let anyone to hit my guy.
What Ravi did was wrong.
Even if there was a shortage, you shouldn’t have sent an amateur to referee.
There was no shortage.
Their plan was to disqualify our pigeon.
Just shut up.
You tell us, anna.
No matter what, you shouldn’t have fought.
Should have either talked it out or come straight to me.
Talked it out?
Hey, tell anna what you told me.
What did you say?
I said they didn’t know to raise pigeons but they threaten.
I breathe to raise pigeons.
Would I keep mum when he says that?
Would you have kept quiet if someone said it to you?- I’d have slaughtered him.
If you still think it’s my fault, tell me what to do.
Anna, Maari shouldn’t organize tournaments anymore.
I’ll decide that.
Both of you are at fault.
All this started because you organized the tournament.
Let Maari organize it as always.
Shake hands and mind your own jobs.
No, anna- Hey! Do as I say. Get up.
Shake hands.
Spit on it.
You’ve changed these days, anna.
Anna, I’ve been asking you for a while now.
What?
I told you. I’ve found a link.
The demand over red sanders is increasing by the day.
If you could let me do it too...
You can’t even organize a tournament without hassles.
And you want to do this?
Just mind your job, I’ll take care of it.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Please come.
I saw your designs on your Facebook page.
Your designs have a personal touch.
We don’t find that in big stores.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
We’ll shop for both the Receptionand Mehendi here itself?
Okay, dear. Whatever you say.
I’m buying all my friends identical sarees.
You need to design that too.
For sure! We’ll do a super job.
Very good fabric.
Morning fuctions--Is that a customer?
Yes.
I am Maari.- Hi.
One of this shop’s business partners.
Hello sir, myself Swaminathan.
Let it be.
I’m a partner in my dad’s business.
Jewellery shop.
He’s a goner.
Really?- Yeah, sir.
Okay, okay.
I found the ad on Facebook.
You’ve come to the right place.
Marriage on the 23rd...
I’m doing Mehendi on the 22nd.
Rascal.
Talking about doing some girl called Mehendiwhen your bride is here.
No, it’s not that.
I meant the henna function.
Say sorry to him.- Sorry.
He’s got a separate henna function.
Some of us can’t even afford our weddings.
Smile, powder-face.
What?- You said 'smile'!
I was talking to her!
Sridevi! Discussed the rates yet?
No.
They’re looking at the designs.
Let them look. But I’ll fix the rates, okay?
Okay?- Yes.
So, here...
Wait, wait!
I told you I’ll fix rates!
Taking decisions without your partner’s consent?
Maari-- Here you go, sister.
This is too much, sir!
Our shop is special, ma’am.
You have to pay its worth.
Mr. Maari, this is unfair.
You!
What?
Listen!
You have a separate function to apply henna.
This seems more unfair to you?
Okay, we’ll think about it and call you.
Yes, we’ll call you.
Sit.
Want instructions from the wife?
Sit down.
You have to buy from us.
These are the rates.
Pay fifty percent upfront and fifty percent upon delivery.
Look, your partner is acting like a rowdy!
Not “like a  rowdy”.
I am a rowdy!
Don’t hit me.
I’ll pay you.- Don’t pay him.
Saw that?
This is how you do business.
How do I trust you with such a huge company?
Send my cut across in the evening. Okay?
He cries a river for this! All your training?
Who hit you, sweetie? You look like Mr. Bean!
Coming!
Don’t cry, it’s embarrassing.- I’m sorry.
I didn’t expect them to behave this way.
I have nightmares about death...
…looking at death certificates all day.
No suspicious deaths have occurred in the area, sir…
…all of them match registered police records.
I’ve checked those too.
Nothing is connected to Maari.
That murder never happened.
Please drop this matter, sir.
Stop.
Sree baby. Come here. Look who is here!
What are you doing?-What?
Partner, I haven’t received my cut yet.
They called and cancelled the order.
How dare they cancel the order…Who does he think he is?
I’ll finish him off.- No, listen to me.
They place their order here and bought elsewhere.How can we let it go?
They didn’t go elsewhere.
Then?
The wedding has been called off.
Why?
When you threatened them and the guy cried...
...the girl fell out of love, it seems.
She called off the wedding.
Good for him, or he’d have cried all his life.
See, this thing with girls and love is dangerous.
You never know why or for what they’d ditch you.
You’re spurting philosophies!
Don’t laugh.
I borrowed a huge sum to get the materials.
I wanted to pay off my debt with this money.
Pay back your debt with the advance money I got you.
I returned the money to them.
Why?
I only want to earn the right way.
Look here.
If you run the company this way,we won’t make any money.
I have a lot of other businesses…You take care of your debt.
I’m off now. Bye.
Hey.
What?
She’s crying.
I swear I didn’t do anything.
What?
Shouldn’t have let that money go.
Who did you borrow from?
Through a friend of dad’s.
Think his name is Ravi.
It’s “Bird” Ravi.
Very bad.- Your family, your problems.
Let’s go.
Who are you?
We’ve come to buy clothes.
Buzz off.
Take it and throw it out.
Stop it, please.
Sir, my parents have gone out.
It’s okay.
They’re not needed.
What are they doing?
Vacating your store and opening ours.
Sir, we’re trying to pay off your debt.
Business hasn’t picked up yet.
Keep quiet, and we’d only touch the shop.
Okay?
Work faster, guys.
Sir, please sir.
I set it up with great difficulty.
My dream, sir.
Please.
What’s the noise outside?
Who’s that?
Stop it.
Stop it.
Maari, you know what Velu anna would say?
Hey Ravi.
We’re following Velu anna’s orders.
You touched our property, and we touched yours.
This is our shop.
Haven’t you told Bird about our partnership?
Bird. "Bird Ravi" right?
Look, we’ve lent her money.This is none of your business.
You shouldn’t lend money to people in our area.
On top of it you come to collect?
Think we’ll stand by and watch?
We'll finish you off.- Don't remove your t-shirt!
We didn’t know this was your shop.
Listen, big guy. You can’t come show off here.
Velu anna has asked us not to fight.
But keep showing up in our area...
...and anna will know what to do.
Buzz off now!
Breathe out.
Breathe out!
Bloody bugger.
Maari, should we fight for some chick?
You are extorting her too.
That girl is from my area.
I’ll extort her…
…trouble her…
…do whatever I want.
Take your boss, your men, and walk away.
Maari, this is not done yet.
If it's not done then buzz off, man.
What was that?
What?
Don’t create a scene here. Just leave.
Maari.
Thanks a lot.
See what I told you about?
Protection.
Silly girl!
Why did you pair them together? Idiot!
He wanted to try.
You’re a pigeon pimp now?
Keep it inside.
Hello.
What do you want?
After you warned them yesterday…
…they said they don’t want the money.
I couldn’t believe it.
I should thank you.
Okay, go.
I mistook you to only cause trouble to the area people.
Now I understand that outsiders don’t mess with us, thanks to you
You’re not as bad as I thought.
You’re right.
I’m much worse than you thought.
Stop flashing your teeth at me.Get off my back.
Maari. Poor girl, she is only trying to thank you.
Feeling bad for the lady now?
She hoodwinked that guy with his money.
She is trying to do the same to us.
I’ll even work for you…
Till I can afford to pay you back.
Are you mad?
Offering to work for money at a goon’s locale?
Wear your scarf properly.
Your scarf doesn’t even serve its purpose.
They said you don’t misbehave with ladies.
Or I wouldn’t have come to talk to you.
This won’t work out.-It will!
We’re all parched.
Not just us, even the pigeons.
They must be tired of our faces.
They’ll be all excited if she comes.
She is a nice girl. Let her work here.
At least to make up for our sins.
How have we sinned?
We’re so parched, Maari!
What’s with the sudden interest?
Not sudden…
…I’ve been interested…
…ever since I saw you fly pigeons.
When you win, you’d hold the pigeon...
...and stand mighty, and high.
I really liked seeing you like that. Hence.
I’ll come from tomorrow.
Bye.
Hear that? She likes seeing, it seems.
She meant the pigeons, you rascal.
I'm your don don don;And I am your Golden fish.
Here's the scene scene scene;Touch me and I'll make a scene.
You're a little deer, my dear;I'm the caffeine in your coffee.
You're gone gone gone;I'm a goner when you look at me.
Don't you pierce me with those sharp eyes;I want all of you, and more.
Your rosy skin sweeps me off my feet;I'm no match for you, baby.
Your masculinity melts me down;The bird in me has lost it's flight.
While I yearn to cross the line;This coyness holds me back.
I melt away...
I fade away…
I yearn...
Yet, this coyness holds me back.
I am a loyal husband;Giving you royal treatment.
And your daily shopping is guaranteed
O' my mustachioed man!I am your spouse and am naughty.
Giving you a lifetime service warranty.
My dear twinkle! Come, let's mingle.I'm the king of our own forest.
Oh my lover boy, has Cupid's arrow struck you?When it happens, give me a ring.
I'm choking, stammering;Shivering, here in solitude.
Don’t you see him collecting it?
You’re my partner.
I’ll only pay you.
I feel trapped, I feel the heat;I'm ready for a one on one, baby.
I melt away...
I fade away...
I shiver...
Yet, coyness holds me back.
Is it nice? I stitched it myself.
Thanks.
See you, brother.
Why do you call me brother, but not Maari?
Calling him brother doesn’t come naturally to me.
Look here Maari.
This is romance for sure.
She is ogling at you.
She looks like a movie star, why would she check me out?
You don’t understand your worth…
I get that…
But we’ve troubled her so much.How could she like me?
You just don’t get it.
The first step to picking up a chick is to torture her.
Somehow you’ve got that right.
Girls dig bad boys like you and me.
At first sight, I am not a likeable guy.
Are you likeable at second glance?
No one even gives me a second glance!
Say the girl likes me…
I should like her too, right?
She’s a show off. It won’t work out.
Don’t say that. She’s a nice girl.
She and you are ‘Made In China’.
Boss, you mean ‘made for each other’?
You’re old school! What I mean is….
Only I get to hit him!-That’s your fate.
I think she’s a fine chick.
She’s so dainty…
She’d get rosy if you pinch her!
When I see her, I just meltand can’t control myself, Maari.
What?
Will you find another girl like that?
Yes, anna.
The whole area is ogling at that girl.
But she has eyes only for you.
You’re lucky.
Give it a try!
Am I right for the girl?
Of course you're not...
We know that.
But that powder-faced girl doesn't seem to realise it!
Someone’s going to get beaten up now.
So many girls fall for the wrong men and suffer;
Add your name to the list of wrong men.
No, Maari...
She’ll never find a handsome groom…
God!
She’ll never find another groom like you, Maari.
Definitely, anna!
You’re sitting me downand using this chance to pull my leg?
I’ll keep that in mind.
How do I explain this…?
When it’s just us guys, there are no issues.
You can just be free and happy.
When women enter the picture, it gets messy.
I don’t think this will work.
Won’t work out.
It will work, Maari.
Maari- Sri.
Sri-Maari. It’s a good combination.- Shut up!
Just meet her in person and say “I love you”.
If there’s a problem?- He’s the one who gets in trouble.
Go!
You go away, too.
There’s no one but us.
You only. Go!
Why did he bring us along then?
The shirt I gave you.
Finally warmed up to it?
Fits you so well.
You look smart, you know?
It seems you like me.
So I’ve decided to love you.
First time I saw you, I wanted to slap you.
But then I saw the way you were with the pigeons…
So… I love you.
What?
I didn’t say it right?
I’ll say it differently.
I love you.
I love you. I love you!
I’m so sorry.
I think you’ve misunderstood.
I had no such intentions with you.
I’m sorry if I gave you that idea.
Oh, you don’t?
Okay, we’ll drop the matter.
I told them so!
But the fools got me excited and confused.
Okay, let’s mind our work. Bye!
Stop!–What?
Don’t mistake me.
It’s not that I don’t like you.
So you like me?
I do…- Then “I love you”, let’s love each other!
No, I like you. As a person.
This has to be personal.Can’t do this in public!
But I don’t even know anything about you.
What do you do? What are you like?
What do I do? What am I like?
I wake up in the morning and hang out with the pigeons.
Then I go to meet Velu anna.
If he gives me some work, I do it.
Then the boys come over. I just have fun with them.
I get drunk at nights and fall asleep.
Then I wake up in the morning, and hang out with the pigeons.
Then I go to meet Velu annan. If he gives me some work, I do it.
Then the boys come over, I have fun, get drunk and sleep.
That’s all I am.
It’s not that!
How do I explain…
Even if you’re a good person
You’re a rowdy!
I would be scared, right?
How will my parents ever accept?
We’ll finish them off?
No!
I don’t know you well enough.
How can I trust you?
You don’t need to trust me.
Let this go.
Don’t let it confuse you. Bye!
Maari!
Something wrong.
Not there!
Why doesn’t that girl like you?
I don’t know, man.
Did you tell her properly?
I told her “I love you” in every possible way!
That’s not how you say it, Maari!
I…
Love…
You!
Goes that way!
Why do you split it in three like that?
Because it’s three words!
What?
“I  love you” is not a single word?
Three words, Maari!– Not one word?
Why didn’t you tell me that before, you Saturday!
Why have you brought this girl here?
She wanted to talk to you, brother.
You’ve come to develop our friendship?
Have a seat, buddy.
Hey, off you go!
Buzz off, both of you. Come in the morning.
Sit here.
I’ll pour you a drink?- No!
She must be drunk already.
You only drink in star hotels.
I need to talk to you.
Talk away.
I didn’t tell you that I don’t like you.
I just wanted to know more about you.
But you had left by then.
What do you want to know?
Who are you?
How did you turn out this way?
Turn out what way?
Turn out what way?
No, everyone fears you.
Including me.
Do I look like a rapist?
Only gutless men rape.
I am a real man.
Real men don’t rape.
No...
I know about you…
But everyone is so scared of you.
There must be some reason.
Violence.
Murder.
Murder?
Nothing of that sort.
Murder…can’t really call it a murder.
Murder… Something like murder.
Pretty much murder.
There was this guy called Pandi.
Real big shot.
Not any one could have laid a finger on him.
One day I just went and casually stabbed him.
But he didn’t die. So it doesn’t count as murder.
Someone else finished him off two days later.
But I got all the credit.
It won’t work out. Go home and think all night.
If it’s okay, it’s okay. Else, just drop it.
Stop bothering me. Okay?
Get out.
Why is the police here without permission?
Don’t yell, man. He’s come with a warrant.
Maari’s asleep. Come back later.-Don't yell!
Don’t make a sound or I’ll kill you.
We’ve got a warrant against you.
Officer asked me to bring you in.
Who is the officer?
Hey “Punching Bag”, wake me up. I’m having a bad dream.
Get up. We’ve come to arrest you.
Arrest? For what?
Murder?
Murder… Something like murder.
Pretty much murder.
There was this guy called Pandi.
Real big shot.
Not anyone could have laid a finger on him.
One day I just went and casually stabbed him.
Don’t hit me, sir.
This is how you run a business.
I can’t take this anymore.
I am going to the police.
Listen to me, madam. It’s unnecessary trouble.
I don’t care. I want to meet the sub-inspector.
What’s the problem?
It’s just a petty case.
Sir, I want to file a complaint against Maari.
Nuisance case. File the complaint.
I’m ready to testify anywhere.
I appreciate your bravery.
But if I charge him with this case…
…he’d get out very easily.
Then he’d only cause more trouble for you and me.
We need to catch him in a bigger case.
I’ll be glad to help however I can.
After a lot of searching, I’ve found the file of a closed case.
The murder attempt of a man named Pandi.
The suspect’s description and age fits Maari’s.
But that’s not enough.
We need stronger evidence connecting Maari to the case.
What can I do for this?
What would you do?
I’ll help you raise your pigeons.
Calling him brother doesn’t come naturally to me.
What happened?
Maari, careful!
Just hungover from last night’s booze.
Get that.
Showing me a cop movie, first thing in the morning.
Good job, man. Good job.
I’ve done a lot of hooliganism.
Rowdyism.
Broken a few bones.
I’ve done everything but nothing happened.
For the first time ever…
…I fell in love.
And they’re going to lock me up.
That is the fate.
“Fall in love, Maari”.
“Fall in love, Maari”.
“Fall in love, Maari”.
Screwed us, right?
What are you looking at? Come, take me away.
He suggested it but the girl has accepted it.
Everyone seems to have developed, just not us.
Is it okay?
A little to the left.
Yeah, perfect.
Why are they bursting crackers?Is it a festival day?
Not a festival, Maari.The news of your arrest has spread.
They don’t even burst crackers for holidays.
But look at them celebrating my arrest!
They’ve torn it already?
You guys don’t stay here, go away.They’ll keep prodding you.
If a girl comes and says she loves you, just chase her away.
We don’t have anyone but you, Maari.
No one in the area will respect us now.
Tell him!
Who do we have but you?
Didn’t work out. Don’t overact.
Your brother in law lives in Madurai, right?
Go live with him.
You’ve won.
You used a woman, but you still won.
When you waltzed into my area without permission,I should have kept you under check.
Letting you go was my bad.
Where’s that girl? She must be feasting her eyes.
What an actor you are!
With all that talking and smiling, you’ve finished me, right?
She’s ripped me apart, right?
Done very beautifully!
Get into the vehicle.
Won’t be nice if we force you in.
Oh, my dialogue from the other day?
Good! It was a good counter, let’s go.
Bless you all.
Here comes Maari! Let's go.
How are you?
How are you, anna?
Thought you'd have lost weight…
But you're all plump!
Come on, Maari.- What?
You've lost so much weight.
When have I ever been fat?
One tea, brother!
So, what's up, Oldie?
With me gone, everyone in the areamust have been at peace?
No, Maari. The situation in the area…
…has become very bad.
What happened?
They've arrested Velu annanand kept him under remand.
What?!
You said it wasn't safe for us to be herewhen you're in jail.
We went out of town for a little while.
When we returned, the area was unrecognisable.
That cop didn't just target us for no reason;
He had his own agenda.
Anna! -You idiot!
They've arrested Maariand you're just telling me!
What the hell were you doing,letting them arrest him?
Start the vehicle.
I want him released today!
We've got information thatyou're smuggling red sanders.
The Revenue Department is here with a search warrant
Do you know whose place this is?
Fool, there are cameras.
How did the media get hereeven before searching?
I don't know, sir.
Someone must have leaked information.
Sir, start the search.
Seeing Velu anna's arrest on camera,his allies, the politicians backed out.
There was no one to bail him out.
Start the vehicle.
Arjun has a solid reputation at the Departmentfor busting rowdyism in the area.
Everyone in the area was very happy!They celebrated that fellow- Arjun.
He came to our area one night.
He entered with a plan.
You might've heard about the red sanderssmuggling arrest from last week.
The Forest Department has decided toexport the wood legally.
This job requires immediate labour.
Thought this would be a good opportunityfor the unemployed in the area.
If you're interested, you may sign upfor the job.
Officer Arjun has come up with this.We can trust him;
Let's sign up.
You've received an invitation toget a job! Go sign up.
Sekar, you should sign up.
Come, you should sign up, too!
No way!
This won't suit me at all.
Both red sanders and ordinary wooden logsare stacked here.
One load of each needs to be loadedin the lorries.
That's the job.
The people asked no questionsand continued to work this way.
This went on for two days.
One day, Arjun didn't turn up at the yard.
There was a raid that night.
Seize the goods and confiscate it.
Stop the labourers. No one shall escape.
Sir, this is for the government.
Sure, a government job taking placeall hushed up in a closed mill?
Sir, something is wrong.
You may call Officer Arjun.He's the one who got us these jobs.
We went straight to him after finding this place.
He asked us to make the arrests.
Just get in the jeep!
Smuggling wood, are we?
Why is he running like this?
Why are you running?
The people who had signed up fortransporting the wood….
…They've been arrested and taken in.
What?
Officer Arjun had taken them for the job.
Did you tell him about it?
I went to the station;They said he has taken two days off.
The next day, strange things began to happen.
Listen up, everybody!
All the shops in the marketplaceare under Ravi annan's control now.
You had better pay up on time,If you want to your shops to remain.
Even Maari is gone now;Who are you to collect from us?
Exactly!
Want to see what would happen ifOfficer Arjun finds out?
You were right!
I had to see what would happenif Arjun finds out.
Anyone else has something to say?
I shall never hear Maari's name again.
Whatever I say will be the law.
That's when we found out…
This cop and "Bird" Ravi were in ittogether the whole time!
Sir, we sent our men to workonly because of your word.
Now they're saying something about smuggling!
Yes.
I did take them for a smuggling job.
Ravi and I did all this together.
If I'd told you that…
You wouldn't have come to work.
We were just trying it for the first time;There was a small goof up.
And there was a raid, too!
Sir, testify that they didn'tknow what the job was;
And get them released, sir.
Are you stupid?Then I'll get caught.
No way. Just leave.
Sir, I helped you becauseI thought you were a good guy.
How could you listen to themand do such terrible things?
Listen to them?
This was all my idea.
Do you know why we snatched Maari and Velu?
To take their places.
This is why I re-opened Maari's old case.
You stopped being of use after Maari's arrest.
Don't ask unnecessary questions.Mind your business.
No.
I won't let this go.- What will you do, woman?
What will you do?
Sir, this is wrong.
Arumugam, chase them away.
What are you staring at?
Poor people.Let's get them out somehow!
Listen, just do as I say.
Everybody, leave.
Their plan was to move you and Velu annanout of the picture to smuggle red sanders.
"Bird" Ravi's controls Pigeon race and tournaments.
There is no ethics. It's terrible.
They just do everything to their convenience.
Most of the pro fanciers have stopped racing.
Let's go.
I got word from Velu annan after your release;
He said to leave the area;That it will be better to vacate.
Let's leave.
You're just going to leave?
What else can we do?
Velu annan has said so himself.Who do we stay back for?
Bring the pigeons and everything.
Let’s leave.
Punching Bag, you heard him.
Pack our stuff and bring it out;We'll get a moving vehicle.
Why are they loading things?
I don't know!
You useless, bring it carefully.
When did you get here?
Has Maari been released?
Is he here, too?
Can't you tell?We're just leaving.
He'll never come by here.You can be happy.
It's so hard to leave our birthplace!
Look, it's hard for us, too.
You deserve it!You played the fiddle to that cop.
We'll do our jobs elsewhere.
Your shops will rot, wait and see.
Look who else is here!Let’s quickly leave.
Look there! They've decided to pack and disappear.
Punching Bag, isn't your annan Maari here?
How could he ever face anyone in the area?
Look, you stabbed him in the dark.Don't be so proud of yourselves.
You're not fit to compete with annan.
What? What qualification do we need?
Don't do it!
Go ahead and do it.He can take a beating.
Maari hits you everyday.Let us hit you today.
Hit him!
I will hit you and you will take it./He was leaving anyway.
Hey, let him go!
Come.
You will go to him?
Maari!
Don't do it, Maari! Don't!
Hey, dummy! Looks like your face is poached.
Cheekiness is bad.
Run.
Run and tell that cop.
I’m here to stay.
He may have the area under his control.
But Maari is always out of control.
Only I get to beat him up.
Think you get to show off in my area?
I'll finish you off!
Stop! What are you doing here?
Maari doesn't want to see your faces.
Go away.- Get out of my way!
We want to talk to our man Maari.- Your man Maari?!
Maari, things got really rough in your absence.
That cop tricked us and got us in trouble.
Not just that, he's hiked the bribe threefold.
None of us can live!- Drop dead, then.
Yes, Maari.We were really scared and helpless.
We'll be brave now that you're here.
You men…
You're the ones who burst crackers andcelebrated my arrest!
This wash-basin face was theone who fired a flower-pot.
You people chose to be allied to that cop.
Suffer, now.
Go away!
You heard the man. Leave.
Cart yourself away!
Are you stupid?
He would have left on his own.
Now you picked a fight with him andmade him stay back.
What could he do here, anyway?
We shall corner him at the right time and place.
Check if all the pigeons are in the right condition.
I'll come and checkon the young birds in the morning.
We'll start the training tomorrow morning.Or it will be too late.
What?
How dare you come here?-I only came to apologise.
I'm sorry.
I know you must be very angry with me.
But...
I did have my reasons.
I thought I was doing the right thing.
I didn't realise I was helping the bad guy.
Anyhow, it's wrong to betray someone's trust.
So, I'm really sorry.
I've come all the way to apologise!
Won't you at least respond to me?
I forgive you. Leave.
Go, Powdered-Face.
Maari asked you to leave!
Do you know Maari committed that murder?
Because they killed his loved pigeon.
Tell me honestly, if you'd been in his place…
Wouldn't you be furious?Wouldn't you have finished them off?
Why do you trouble the area people?
Why can't you show the affection on peoplethat you bestow upon pigeons?
Why should we?To these people?
Did they do that for Maari?
Who helped him when he was a kid?
When he was alone and hungry?
Not one person came.
He only had one thing then: His pigeons.
It was the pigeons that fed him.
Maari always says, you can trust a pigeonbut not a human.
Now you've proved him right.
What I did seemed right that day…
Don't you talk about right and wrong!
Have you ever struggled in life?Have you ever struggled for a daily meal?
If you just waltz in here and apologise,think he'll grin and accept?
Look, he doesn't ever want to set eyeson you after what you've done.
If you keep coming back here,it will get rough.
Stop talking to that Powdered-Face!Let's leave
What's your problem?
Tell me, or buzz off!
A few days after you went to the jail,my school fees was due.
But it wasn't paid at all.
That's when the school staff told methat you've been paying my fees.
I didn't pay.
I know you're doing it secretly.
I won't tell anyone that you're paying.
Hey, idiot! I told you I'm not.
What do I care if you go to school?
Just go away.
Did that cop trick you and jail you?
Did they hit you in the jail?
Did you suffer?
Poor thing.
It wasn't that bad. Go, now!
I wasn't talking about you. I meant the cop.
You'll get him, one fine day!
Loudmouth, go to sleep.
Rogue!
We can enter our birds to the race next week.
All the pigeons are ready.
Our next target is Arjun.
Don't know why, but my handsfeel all jittery since morning.
What?
Need to do something about this Arjunand "Bird Ravi"- Urgently!
He's a cop.
You can't do him on urgent basis.Must keep calm.
I'm idle nowadays.Feeling a little lazy.
I'm so bored; I want to…
…get a job.
A job?
Oh Jesus! Save this Child…
What?
Did you have a job before all this?
Of course, man!
We were breaking a few bones,causing trouble!
Collecting racketeering money amdWe even raced pigeons.
Is that a job, anna?
You've been acting cocky ever since I returnedfrom the jail…
Not for me.What job can you do?
I'll do any job!
What job?- Any job!
So we'll get you a painting job with Murugan?
But painting is an artist's job.I can't do that!
You paint the place red when you hit people.- But that’s not the same, idiot!
There's a mechanic in our area- Mani.You can chase him out and do his job.
Chasing out part, I can do...
But I don't know about unscrewing, screwing and all that.
You said you'll do any job!
You're only naming jobs that I can't do.
Remember Rani akka?
We seized an auto from her husbandwhen he failed to pay up.
That auto is still with us.
That's correct!
We'll dismantle and sell the parts?-No!
We'll drive the auto!
Just talking about it won't do!You need to know how to ride one.
Come here.
You don't even respond to me normally…- Come here. Sit.
Tell me-Sit down!
What's the matter?- The auto…
You're mocking me?
Auto... you can drive.
Say something.
Shall we?- You can drive.
You can drive, brother.
Then we’ll start driving an auto from tomorrow.
Superb!
You carry on.-Be careful, anna!
I said get in, man.- It's an inauspicious time…
Get in.
Do as Maari says.
You come with us, anna.
Hope nothing happens!
This is strange!
Want to take the auto?
No, anna.
Where are you headed?- Saidapet.
Won't take the auto to Saidapet?
I take the bus.
Just get in.- No, anna…
Get in, boy.- No, anna…
Please.
Anna, please…
Stop it!
Give us the amount.
How much, anna?- Just give me that!
Here- Anna!
Please, give me a tip, anna!
Give you… a tip?
Pick that up and go.
Stop!
Grab that guy… Come here!
Get in... go sit inside.
Auto, huh?- Of course it’s an auto.
Get in.
Sir, I've come on my bike.
I said get in.
Tiny guy… you talk too much!
Squeeze in! Push in!
He wants to ride in some other auto!- What are you doing?
Just come, man.Else we’d be in trouble with Maari.
Keep going, don't stop!
Maari, they're refusing to accept our entry.Have a word with them.
The entry time is up, Maari.They've said not to accept any more entries.
That's not a big deal at all.Call Muthu anna. We'll talk to him.
He's not the current president.
If you want to register after the last date, talk to the new president.
Here he comes. Talk to him.
It's this guy? I knew it.
Hello, Maari.
You've come to register?The last date is over.
You should have come sooner.
Oh, I'm sorry! You were in the jail, right?
What do we do, anna?- I don't know, sir.
I said there's a chance if they request you.
That's true.
Ask them to request, then.
Request to your dirty face?
Maari, we'll see next year.
Saturday, don't play up.- I'm saying it openly.
It's our turn in this area now.
Are you flying your birds this year, "Bird" Ravi?
Yes.
Okay, that's nice.
You should do that.
What are you grinning for?
That's nothing. Forget about it.
I asked you why you were grinning!
Look at that board.
You must wish to see your name there, sometime.You go ahead and fly your birds.
You think we can’t compete with your birds?
The whole world knows that.Raising your voice won't change it.
We'll let you win this time.
Take his entry.
We'll see who wins.
No, I'll let you have it this time.
You let your birds race!
Come here!
Why is he such a moron?- Yeah!
You heard the Prez. Take our entry!
We prevented him from participatingso that you could win.
He knew you would fall for itif he teased you.
And you fell for it!-Let it be.
His pigeons are three months behind ours in training.
He doesn't have any money to feed themspecial food and medicines.
We've readied our pigeonswith imported medicines and tonics.
We've been training them for four months!This year is ours.
You've been doing all this for years now.
Why have you never won?
You can't win unless you admit theopponent's strengths.
Even if he starts training them late,even if he trains them with just water;
His pigeons will win.
That's Maari.
That's why I told you not to let him enter.
What do you even know about pigeons?
Wait and watch.
As the race day draws closer,you'll get nervous and ask me for help.
It will happen.
Don't stare at the pigeon after feeding it.He can't digest his food.
Anna.
Has the trial date been announced?
The pigeons are getting ready.
Why are you hitting him?
He asked me not to come.But I came anyway.
You do good to others secretly, right?
You've been paying Kavitha's school fees?
Who? Our Loudspeaker Kavitha?You never told us!
Why do you refuse to reveal the good in you?
It's fine if you don't want to accept.
I knew there's a good guyin there, somewhere.
Now I've seen that.And that's enough.
Even if you keep chasing me away,I'll keep coming back to help.
You've helped me enough, already.
What are you trying to get from me,by fawning this way?
Why do you like it so much to be a bad guy?
I'd rather be a pure bad guythan an adulterated good guy.
Okay?
Ask the street vendors to pay up.- Okay!
Don't leave out anyone.
Pay up! Quick…
Pay.- Here.
Greetings, anna.
Take it out.
What are you staring at? Go!
What a measly amount!
Have all the auto drivers paid up?- Yes, all of them…
Except him.
Since when does Maari drive an auto?Why hasn't he paid?
He refuses to join the union.
He refused and you accepted?
Pay up, man.
Pay up nicely or we'll make you.
Go.
I said, go!
He'll break your ribs, the King of Con;Can't toss him a bone, he's the don.
Now he's back- bigger and better.Our man Maari, he's a victor!
You'll take it?
Will you take it and reach home in a piece?
Dare to throw an angry gaze;Maari will mangle your face.
Wanna trot like some big gun?Consider your life done.
Rat on Maari like a wuss;Wait and see what Maari does.
He's a different kind of rowdy;- Maari;He won't talk nice, he's Maari.
How much?- No, it's fine.
Let it be, Maari.- Right.
Still scared of him?
You should have beat him up andcollected the money.
Easy for you to say.We're the one who got beat up.
It's nothing, sir.
Let it go. Doesn't matterif one guy doesn't pay.
Why do you think we collect?
Is it a major source of income?
Even they're struggling to pay us.
We're collecting to keep them under control.
Even if one person refuses to pay,that fear will subside.
Can’t let that happen.
Need to fix it tomorrow!
The chains were a lot heavierbefore I went to prison.
Now it's all light.
He was roaming around with them!
Roaming?- I had it in my house, man.
Maari is the most bejeweled auto driverin Tamil Nadu!
Anna, look who's here.
Really?
Maari drives an auto?
I was expecting complaints that he's doingrowdyism and causing trouble…
But he’s just driving an auto?
What is it, Maari?
Heard you refused to pay the fee?
Caught up in the past, were you?
You're a nobody now.
Get that in your head first.
If I'm a nobody,what drove you to come here?
I meant, your jeep.
Looks like a bit of the old Maari is leftin the auto-guy somewhere!
Shouldn't be.
Drop your cigarette.
Drop it!
Careful, Maari!
Sir, why are you hitting him?
Maari, listen.He's a cop. Let's not cause trouble.
Sir, we won't cause trouble.-Trying to slither away?
Sir, don't hit him.
Please listen to us.Don't hit him.
Anna, ask him to stop.
No, sir. Don't hit him!Please listen, sir.
Sir, please tell them to stop.
Stop hitting!
Okay, that's enough. Stop!
I'm the boss here from now. Okay?
Either run away with your pigeons.
Or lie low with your tail between your legs.
Else, I'll come hit you whenever I'm bored.
You're my Punching Bag now.
Hey, give me a cigarette./Give him a cigarette.
So...
When a mosquito bites a sleeping man,it doesn't make it a hero.
One fine day, if it bites him when he's awake,one SWAT! and it's POOF!- done for.
One fine day...
He comes in his cop uniform,knowing we can't hit him then.
If only he dared to come without it!
We shouldn't keep quiet anymore, Maari.
Just say the word and we'll deal with himin other ways.
We need to get Velu annan released first.- How will that cop let that happen?
Listen.
Where are you running?Come here, little guy!
Maari, I don't know anything.
I didn't help him intentionally.
I thought he was a nice guy.I'm not on his side.
I need some information to lock him.
You know all about the frauds he's committed?
Tell me.
I'd lose my job if he found out.
If you don't tell him, you'll lose your life.Is that okay?
Tell him!
I don't know his lorry routes, Maari.
But I do know one thing.
To avoid the checking that happensin all the tolls...
He uses travels vehicles to carry small loads.
I know some of these routes, Maari.
Looks like the customs guys.We're caught!
Lift it up????
I'll hit you!
Sir, we got it, sir.
Meaning?- We got the wood.
Shit!- Open the door.
Bloody hell.- What?
Hell, man!
Bullshit!
Hello?
The press and media have come to the station.Did you call them?
What, the press?
Officer Arjun is here!Catch him!
On camera, I mean.
He's done so much, but acts like he's done nothing.
Thank you, officer Arjun.You've made our jobs easier.
How much you have contributed!-He does that a lot, sir.
Keep up the good work.- Thank you, sir.
Come here.
What's going on?-Sir, this is your doing, right?
You're so modest!
What?
When I came in the morning, the smuggled woodand the smugglers were outside the station.
I thought you caught them as usualand called the Revenue Department.
Are you out of your mind?- Not so loud, sir!
I didn't do it.
Who else?/How do you get it right every time, sir?
You're a smart one, sir.
He's so right every time,almost like he's the one transporting it!
He's a very nice guy!
Wondering why your own goods arein your station?
You're not in control, as you think, officer!
I stand to lose nothing with this.
It's not just the goods that were caught;Your men were caught with it.
Upon enquiry, he's willing to talk.He could talk to the Revenue Officers, too.
Think about what would happen to you then.
The Press is here, too.
This was the mosquito that bit me when I wasasleep the other day, right?
What did I tell you?
I told you, if I wake up one day andone SWAT!, you're POOF!- done for.
It’s done for.- I know!
What do you want?
Release Velu annan.
How is that possible?We've got evidence.
Like you need lessons in deceit, officer!
Get one of your own men to surrenderand get Velu annan out or else…
Punching Bag!- Present, sir!
Just checking!How did you do it, sir?
It was superb.The area has been better since you came.
Ask him one by one, he'll answer patiently.
May I leave, officer?
Move, move./Careful, don't share it on WhatsApp!
Release Velu?Don't do it, man.
You've been an enemy all along.
But I was an insider who betrayed their trust.He would be very pissed off with me.
Not just that, Maari's position will geteven stronger if Velu is out.
What can I do?Want me to get arrested, instead?
Your man has been caught red-handed.
This was the one thing you had to do.And you've screwed that up, too.
Look what's happened now!
Don't get worked up.We'll all get locked in if we're caught.
That's why I'm telling you, Velu has to be released.
Velu has lost his political supportafter he went to jail.
Even if he's released now…
He can't touch a policeman without support.
We’ll deal with it.
You're a cop, so you'll be okay.What if he targets us?
That's your problem.
Sir, you're disassociating yourself?
Look, it's your man who's been caught.
I can still get you in trouble and escape.
Be happy that I haven't done that.
Try to transport the goods safely from now.
What's happening, anna?He's saying such things….
And there's no respect these days.
We need to be careful with him.
Move aside!
Move aside!
Greetings, anna.
Stop.
Anna is here.
Come Maari. Honour him.
Move aside.
Welcome, anna.
Maari...
Get up... Get up.
Dad!
I told you not to go there!
Are you okay?-I'm okay, dad.
How did you get released?-They released Velu annan first.
Then they said it was the same caseand released all of us.
Maari is the cause for our release.-Yeah?
When I heard that you'd been released,I knew you'd get me out somehow.
But why did you use this evidence?
It's gone waste!
You're out of prison.What more do we need?
If we'd gone to Revenue Department,we could have gotten back at him.
Or even finished him completely.
Think I'll let the guy who got you locked up get away?
I'll take special care of him.
You forget about it, anna.
Tomorrow is the festival of lights.And you're out of prison!
You just watch our atrocity in our area today!
See, they're celebrating our arrival.
Stop right there!
The area is done for today!
Take a still, Maari.I'll come too!
Come, let's go.- Where, anna?
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
Stop it! About turn.
Buzz off!
Come here, beautiful.
Check out this look!
Send him./Just send him off, Maari.
Maari. Let go.
Saw that? He's started his atrocity again.
Keep quiet. I owe my release to him.
Buzz off.
I'll be back!
Go get a haircut. Go!
Maari, it's thanks to you that our menhave been released.
What?
What a pity!
Who got your men out?I only got Velu annan out.
You were just free add ons.Get out!
Hi, dude!- Hi!
Look at all the reverence.
How's it going, man?- Fine, man.
Give me a hi5, man.- Cool!
You fool.
They're here?It's the festival of lights indeed.
Start collecting in all the shops.
Oh, it's that guy.
Prem.
Go to the street vendor.
Like that!
Hold it!
What, they're back?
Pay up the money.- It's festival time…
So what if it's festival time?
Pay up!
Pay up, man.
Someone is going to get it!
Anna, pay up. I want to go home!
It's not unusual to collect,right, Maari?
Poor fellow.
There!
Anna, at least you pay up, please?
He'll break your ribs, the King of Con;Can't toss him a bone, he's the don.
You’re wearing make up?
Oldie, walk away or I'll light up this cracker on you.
Come, I’m going.
Poor girl, this Sri.
This is the usual amount.Return this back to them.
Festival wishes to you!- Same to you.
I love you all.- Bye!
I know it looks crooked, my path.
All you straight-forward guys, get out!
It might feel a bit wrong;but it's right.
Don't get it?Don't bother.
This light of our livesIs Maari the Great!
Even the policeSalute him!
Stay if you want to;Or walk away.
Good times are here!
Bend over;And people stab you in the back.
So stand tall;That's the only life hack.
When finding a partnerIs like finding trouble;
Being a lonerMakes so much sense.
Don't you say such things, son.
We are one, now and forever.
Do what feels right, son.
The doors to my home are open, for you.
I was born alone; I'll die alone.
I don't need any family.
Her words oozed honey;She came into my life.
She ruined me;Why did I bother?
Have the birds returned from training?
We flew fifty; Only twenty have returned.
What about Maari's?
He flew thirty; All thirty have returned.
What's funny?
I told you the other day.
That you'd come to me for helpas the race draws closer.
What can you do?
He can't participate without his birds.
No, don't do that. Be quiet.
You don't understand the seriousnessof pigeon fancying business.
Make sure he doesn't do anything.
Officer Arjun, you've done so much for us.
Let us handle this.
Who says I'm doing this for you?
He should feel pain.
We need to hit him where it hurts.
Don't do anything without Ravi anna's consent.
It's already done.
Maari.
Ten of our pigeons are dead.
They've set it on fire when we weren't around.
It was that girl Sridevi, who opened the cagesand saved the pigeons.
If it wasn't for her, all the birds would be dead.
She burnt hands while trying to save the birds.
She was here when they burnt the cage.
If she hadn't been there, all the birds would be dead.
They say pigeons never return to a burnt cage.
They’d have gotten scared.
Our pigeons will never return, anna.
Maari, don't mistake me for saying this.
Let's leave this place.
There's nothing here for us.Why should we suffer here?
Velu anna is back now.Let him deal with the police.
Why should we struggle?
They could have attacked us!
What did the poor birds do to them?
I know you'll refuse…
But, it hurts to see you like this. Maari.
Let's get out of here.
Punchingbag, pack our thingsand get the vehicle ready.
Go on!
Saturday.
Look there!
You said pigeons don't return to a burnt cage.
How did they return?
The birds know this is their home.
But you don't realise it.
This has to end today.
I told you not to do anything!
Everyone found out that we set fireto his loft.
I've been banned from pigeon racing altogether!
What about it?
My dignity is lost!
I can't race pigeons anymore.
Stop yelling!
Following my word got you this far.
So what if you can't race?
Playing with pigeons…
You won't understand that.
It's an ancestral sport.
You're following his instructions now?
Anna, don't just hit me!
You're just a label.
It's Officer Arjun who plots the action.
So you're supporting him?
Fools, do you know what you've done?
Do you know what Maari would doif you lay a finger on his pigeons?
What would he do?
He was just waiting for the right moment.
You’ve taunted him.He will come!
Maari, listen to me!
Don't do this, Maari.
I only kept quiet this longas you were a cop.
But you've touched my pigeons.
I'll kill you and go to prison again.
I'm sorry, Maari…
Maari, wait! Listen to me.
Wait, Maari.
Listen to me, Maari.
I forbade that policeman,but he threatened us to do it.
I had nothing to do with your loft burning.
I know all about the frauds he's committed.
I am willing to testify anywhere, anytime.
I don't even trust a good man.Why would I trust filth like you?
You were saying?
You'll kill me and go to prison?
I'll say you killed him for revengeand get you locked up.
You crook! I told you not to trust him.
Round up everyone.No one should escape.
Come on fast.You go that way.
Maari, wait. Don't hit him!
What was that?
You always say...
"I'll finish you off!"
See what I've done?
Now I've finished you.
You'll spend the rest of your life in prison.
Drag him away.
What are you doing?
That's not our man.
That's the man. Get him.
Let me go!
Sir, why are you arresting me?
Let me go.- Stop.
They've told us what you do.
I've got a guy in the Revenue Department.
I'll be restored to my old power.
All I need is an eye-witness to everythingthat Arjun has committed.
Sir.
I'm not afraid, with Maari and you by my side.
I'm willing to talk openly.
What did you say? You'll finish me?
That was nice. You said it real nice.
And don't come out, okay?
Just stay inside.
You'll be safer there.
Sub-Inspector Arjun has been arrested byRevenue Department for smuggling red sanders.
I can't decide whetheryou're a good guy or a bad guy.
Why do you doubt it?
Of course I'm a bad guy!
Good guys can't be trusted.
They can turn bad at any point.
Men who appear to be good but do bad,are even worse.
But a guy, who openly claims to be bad…
…but does some good, can be trusted.
I trust you.
So what?
I feel like a lie from a long time back...
...has become the truth now.
I'm serious.
I really do like you now.
Oh dear.
No, madam.
No thank you!
This romance thing won't suit my character.
I've got my pigeons, my boys…
And I've got the area people to troublewhenever I'm bored.
I’d be free and happy like thisall the time.
You think about it, we could just befriends if you want.
Okay?
Bye.
Take a photograph!
Move aside.
Look at that!
Maari.
It's been so peaceful since Arjun left.
It's been so many years sincewe lived without paying bribes.
For living peacefully in this area without fear...
We don't know how to repay this debt, Mr Maari.
Look at him, bluffing.
All the money I lost while in the prison...
All the compensation money in this period…
The money you have saved fromnot paying my cut.
Plus service charge and service tax;
Seven lakhs.
Amounts to seven lakhs.
If all of you pay me that money...
We'll call it even.
What's he saying?
Maari is so funny!
Look at him.
I'm talking seriously here.You think I'm being funny?
Settle this within a month orthe treasury first and then your throat.
You rogue!
So you're going back to rowdyism?
Did I ever claim to have reformed?
Maari will always be this way.
