HOUSE OF ANGELS
Being of sound mind...
...of sound mind...
...and in full possession
of his faculties,
Erik...Zander
Turn off the music.
Hello, Erik.
So you're out and about?
This is my will.
Only don't open it
until after my death.
-Why do this today?
-Why do you dance today?
That's true. Say, Erik...
I'm aware that it's not attested.
But you're a lawyer,
and I wrote it.
I'll take care of it.
Strange fellow...
There are people who jump
off a 60-meter high crane
with a rubber cord
around their ankles.
-Would you do it? Sixty meters.
- Sixty meters...
It couldn't be worse than preaching.
I take the plunge every Sunday, Rut.
Without the benefit of a cord.
-And you do it well.
-What would I do without you?
What if you weren't married?
Axel's out hunting.
Axel couldn't hit an elephant...
Not even a stuffed elephant!
What a beautiful sight.
It must be worth 15 to 20 million.
It's been mismanaged...
-Your great-grandfather...
- His name was Axel, too.
That's right, he happened
to be named Axel as well.
He was a forestmanager, one of
the pioneers of modern forestry.
Planted new trees.
I bet this stretch of the woods
once was a bunch of seedlings
in those huge hands of his.
These woods have
been in the family for generations.
Or rather, we've roamed them
that long, but never owned them.
But that's going to change,
one day they'll be mine.
And echo with the sound of logging.
- I'll give you a lift.
- No, I have my bike.
Look, it's Erik...
You don't see him out much.
Could he have a flat tire, you think?
Erik, what can I do for you?
- I'm here for archeological reasons.
- Good bye!
-A hole in the ground.
-A hole?
It doesn't really matter where it is,
in the woods or in the fields,
but since
I'll probably get dug up again,
maybe we should
stick to hallowed ground.
We have some nice sites over there.
This is nice and shady...
There.
I don't need much.
I'm planning on
being ever so still.
Didn't they teach you
anything at agricultural college?
I learned how
to plant potatoes, at any rate.
If someone dies without heirs,
the state gets it all.
The State Inheritance Fund
holds an auction.
And the property
goes to the highest bidder.
And who is the wealthiest person
around, at least in these parts?
-The estate will be mine...
-Well, first Erik has to die.
If he's anything like his dad,
you'll need patience.
How are you in that department?
- I can wait.
- I can't. I've got to run.
-Where are you going?
- Mind your own business.
Take it easy.
-What can I do for you?
- Sugar...
Crispbread... and raisins.
I'm sorry. Let's go.
- I've had enough of this.
- Damn, you look good enough to eat.
- It's embarrassing.
- Hush...
Get rid of that.
-What was that?
- How the hell should I know?
- Great! What have you done?
- Shut up!
I shouldn't have come...
He's dead.
And who danced to the right?
Didn't we agree to keep left?
- Put them in the bathroom.
- I don't want them.
I didn't travel that far to come
in second. Jörgen and Camilla won!
-You look like a fancy cake.
- Unlike some people, I wasn't nude.
Camilla was practically naked,
no wonder they got all the points.
What, are you drinking?
-Anna-Lisa Zetterberg.
-Who's calling at this hour?
Astrid.
Hello.
What...What's that?
Now...?
Thanks, it was good of you to call.
Yes, I'll tell him.
-What did she want?
- Erik's dead.
-When's the auction?
- How should I know?
Well, aren't you in charge?
Look, here they come.
When do you figure Axel's
going to buy the woods?
Before they fill in the grave,
if he hasn't done it already.
I wouldn't be surprised
if he fired that shot.
We should have gone to his funeral.
Think he would have gone to yours?
Put on some coffee.
Lucky Erik, it's a beautiful day.
I am going to a city
where the streets
are lined with gold
where the tree of life is blooming
and the roses never fade
Here they bloom
but for a season
soon their beauty is decayed
I am going to a city
where the roses never fade
We have gathered here today
to mourn.
To bid farewell to Erik Zander.
With his demise,
an entire generation passes.
The Zander family...
...has flourished in these parts...
Sorry...
...has flourished in these parts
for nearly 250 years.
It is regretful to see the family's
18th century estate stand empty.
It won't be for long...
But today's memorial service is not
characterized by sorrow alone.
The sound of hope
shall ring out as well.
Our Lord brings joy no earthly power
can take away from us.
The light of the Lord shines
on our brief days and years.
Filling them with eternity.
He is with us until the final hour.
And that promise...
is one we should never forget.
Amen.
Go forth, my heart,
and seek delight
In all the gifts
of God's great might
These pleasant summer hours
Look how the plains for thee and me
Have decked
themselves most fair to see
All bright and sweet with flowers
Ashes to ashes...
Dust to dust.
Jesus Christ, our redeemer
will raise you from the dead
on judgement day.
O, Father who art in heaven
O, Jesus Christ, your son, our savior
O, Holy Spirit
have mercy on us
It's a shame
I never got to meet you, Granddad.
It must be the carpet.
These shoes are hopeless.
When I went over to the grave
my heels sank into the ground.
Good thing you didn't
fall into the grave.
- Be quiet, I'm not fond of funerals.
-Are you feeling better?
- Garters...
- I wasn't sure what to wear.
- Did you know Alice had a daughter?
- Spit that out!
I feel sorry for you,
it can't be easy...
Burying someone you killed isn't
exactly an everyday occurrence.
It was an accident.
My conscience is clear.
- So is mine.
- Really?
- So, the old-timer's her granddad.
-Amazing...
I thought I was going
to shit my pants when she said that.
-What are you doing tonight?
-Two new movies.
Did you brush your teeth today?
Your breath stinks.
- How much is Angel Farm worth?
- Millions.
Don't screw up.
- How much have you heard?
- Ragnar Zetterberg called me.
He told me there had been
an accident and that you...
- It was an accident.
-That the vicar had been involved.
Luckily, you're all right.
- Is Ragnar here?
-Yes, he is.
- Oh, so that's Ragnar.
- Lovely service, Henning.
Hello, Fanny. I'm Ragnar.
You made a magnificent entrance.
- I was just apologizing for that.
- Don't you worry about that.
- It's amazing that you found me.
- It wasn't easy.
But I succeeded.
Fanny, I'd like to hand over
the keys to Angel Farm. Here.
- I feel nervous.
-The house is fantastic.
A yellow house on the lake. Straight
up the road, go left at the store.
I was there for the first time today
myself. Erik was a loner.
- Not many people knew him.
- I knew him, he was a good man.
It's disgusting! Don't look.
She wants to attract attention.
-Wearing an outfit like that.
- Don't look!
This is going to be exciting. Bye!
Good luck!
Zac!
- It's a mansion!
- Big place...
-What a place!
- Can you see it in those glasses?
- Christ, this is a weird place.
-Think it's haunted?
Oh, my God...
What was Erik really like?
Do you have a stuffed swan
in your parlor?
What's wrong?
Oh...
It would have been nice
to have met him.
Damn...
I just wish she had told me.
-What are you wearing?
- I found it in the dresser.
- It's nice. Is it clean?
-Yes...
It's strange...
I'm almost 30, and he's always
known that I was out there
but he never got in touch with me
before he died.
People do strange things
to avoid each other.
That's not exactly healthy...
This whole place
is less than healthy.
Did you see that article I was
reading, about dry rot?
- My room smells funny.
- It's all right in here, though.
We've got
to check the place out tomorrow.
These things can be hazardous.
Damp and dry rot...
Old houses are dangerous.
They're no good...
I think something else
is bothering you... Ghosts.
I'm not afraid of ghosts.
This place has
something even worse.
Rats.
- Have you seen any rats?
- No, but I've seen rat droppings.
Right...
Well, what am I supposed to do now?
Fanny...
-Where were those droppings?
- I've already told you that.
In the bathroom,
the parlor, the kitchen...
...on the stairs, in your bed
and in mine, under the pillow...
I didn't see any rats,
only the droppings.
So, where did
the crap come from?
Go to sleep.
- It beats that bedsit in Berlin.
- Last night I went to the john.
It took me half an hour
to find my way back to bed.
Here they come.
Did you hear me?
Don't look now,
but we're being watched.
Isn't that adorable,
I want to talk to him.
Hello, my name's Fanny Zander,
I'm Erik's granddaughter.
I figured I'd introduce myself, we
didn't meet in church yesterday.
- No, we couldn't make it.
-That's too bad.
My friend Zac and I
are staying at Angel Farm.
Would you like to drop by
for coffee tomorrow? Around four.
- I don't know if we can make it.
- Bring your wife along.
- It's my brother.
- Oh, well he's welcome too.
We'll expect you at four, then.
-Thank you.
- Good bye.
- I'm Fanny.
- Per-Ove.
Zac.
-Are they Swedish?
-Yes, they are.
- Breakfast... Six eggs, please.
- Six.
- Cute...Where are they from?
- Switzerland.
-The house is full of knick-knacks.
- Not ones I bought.
Get regular milk and real butter.
- He's terrified of getting fat.
All he gets is a little potbelly,
otherwise he's as skinny as a worm.
-What should we have for dinner?
- Moussaka.
Do you have eggplant?
- Do we, Eva?
- No.
I didn't say yes...
You didn't say no, either.
I said maybe.
But now that Erik's...
- It's not like it's her fault.
- I'm not going.
I'll go on my own.
All right, we'll go.
Only not a word about Alice,
or I'll go home.
Sangre de Toro.
- Sangre de Toro, twelve bottles.
-Twelve bottles...
Sangre...
- Oh, take Raimat instead.
- Raimat.
- Do you deliver?
- Sure.
Sorry, the moped broke down.
No, it isn't.
It worked this morning...
It's not working now.
That's all right,
we'll manage with a few runs.
That won't be necessary,
I'd be glad to help.
- Do you take American Express?
-Yes, if you can show us some ID.
He doesn't have an Amex card.
That complicates things...
That's a joke.
- Is that it?
-Yes. And you'll deliver...
If the moped's working.
You can compare me to Eve
who never wants to leave
this lovely Garden of Eden...
She doesn't fit in here, they've
never been in the country before.
I don't understand
what they're doing here.
And Mårten... I found these
magazines under his mattress.
Girlie magazines...
And meeting people like them
could be his undoing.
I really don't think...
It's not good.
So why not indulge in
the sweet bliss of romance
take a chance
don't let it slip by you...
I don't know why they
had to come here. It's terrible.
She came to the store, didn't she?
- Naked?
- Not totally, but practically.
- He had black stuff around his eyes.
- Make-up.
-And earrings too.
- Maybe she's a dancer.
A dancer?
- She can barely walk.
- She wears a leotard.
She couldn't even
carry home her own groceries.
It's the Continental way.
-They have things delivered.
-They should have stayed there.
Damn her!
Why didn't she tell me
about this place?
Here I am, wearing his wristwatch.
It's pathetic.
- It's a nice watch.
- Sorry, Mother. I love you.
Right, this is what we'll do:
We'll sell this place
and buy a house somewhere else.
- Milan.
- I don't want to live in Milan.
You only want to go to Milan because
of that fling you had with Giovanni.
And you hate Milan
because of your fling with John.
Not a word, you hear.
Everyone makes mistakes.
You know, if Giovanni lived in Borås
I bet you'd say
that you had to live in Borås.
I'm selling the place.
The sooner, the better.
Mårten!
-You're coming with me.
- I'm busy.
- I'm going over to Angel Farm.
-To Angel Farm?
I've got to talk to that girl.
It can wait until tomorrow.
I figured as much.
-As soon as you sign this...
- Do you have a pen?
...you won't have
any financial worries.
I'll clear it with the bank
in Borås in no time at all.
- How much will go to taxes?
-Very little, hardly anything.
- It'll take one or two days.
- I'll keep the copy.
That's right, you take the copy
and I'll take the original.
- I've got to run. Thank you.
-We'll be in touch.
In a couple of days.
I appreciate your confidence in me.
Good bye, Zac.
Looks like it's going to rain.
- I'm Axel Flogfält.
- Fanny Zander.
I own Meadow Heights
and the lumber yard.
I saw you at the funeral,
but we weren't introduced.
Please accept my condolences
with regard to your grandfather.
I really didn't know him, so I have
mixed emotions about all this.
Erik had a lot off riends here.
So this came as a shock to us all.
-Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you.
I've come to help you.
A large farm
with a great deal of land...
I can tell you're a city girl.
I gather that you don't
want to get your hands dirty.
So I want to offer you
a decent price for the entire estate.
Lock, stock and barrel.
Twelve and a half million.
My solicitor just told me
the estate was worth more than that.
Your solicitor? Ragnar?
He told you
it was worth more than that?
- Hello, I'm Fanny.
- Mårten.
The estate is worth 12.5 million.
I've got the down payment right here.
Then again, seeing as you're
Erik's granddaughter,
I can help you out
by raising my offer to 13.
That's generous of you.
But there's no point in discussing
this, I'm not selling the place.
I'm staying on.
But if I ever want to sell the place,
I know who to turn to.
- How much?
-Thirteen.
-Was he angry?
-Yes.
But I'm not selling it.
- Didn't you want to sell it?
- Not today. And not to him.
We've got to get ready.
Flowers herald summer
As nature brings her gifts...
- Feel like a cup of coffee, do you?
-Yes, don't you?
-We want to be there by four.
-We'll make it.
Remember, not a word about Alice.
-The vicar's there.
- Seeing you will be a treat.
I'm wearing my best clothes.
-Thank you.
-Welcome!
Gottfrid and Ivar...
I barely recognized you.
-You look different too, vicar.
- Really?
I'll see you on Sunday then.
-Welcome.
-This is my brother, Ivar.
Bye, Henning.
Let's go straight into the parlor.
Welcome.
I'd like to offer you a drink.
Here you go. I bought this on
the boat, the color's so pretty.
It's green.
It smells rather odd. I tried some.
It's good, but it's pretty sweet.
-You've been here before, surely?
-Around 30 years ago.
Thirty years? Why haven't
you been here in all those years?
I'll go get the coffee.
Please have a seat.
Well, sit down.
Here.
The place hasn't changed.
Unfortunately...
Right, it's still here.
But I reckon it's out of tune.
- Say something!
- Like what?
Would you like something to drink?
I see you've had some...
I'll have a drop myself.
Cheers.
Here comes coffee and buns.
Sugar and cream are on the table.
I bought nearly all the buns
and cookies they had in stock.
Like some coffee?
What a sickening color...
I'll have a sip.
Damn, that was sweet.
But I guess it's drinkable.
Why haven't you
been here for 30 years?
I'm not really sure...
- Did you know my mother?
-Alice? Of course.
-What was she like?
- She was quite a woman.
The two of you are alike.
-Tell me more.
- She was a part of this town.
She belonged to the society,
she sang in church...
- She performed back then?
- Sure, at the youth club.
-Was she good?
- She was better than Alice Babs.
- She was a singer, you know.
- For real?
She performed at nightclubs.
- She sang professionally?
-Yes, but she died when I was 11.
-Who did she marry?
- She never married.
I don't know who my father is,
she never told me.
-You could have said eleven million.
-The place is worth thirteen.
It is, when you include the woods.
A lawyer can't forget about ethics.
Ethics...
Can you say that word
without shitting yourself?
You know that the price
affects your percentage.
Don't try
sitting on the fence, Ragnar.
You could fall and hurt yourself...
-Where's the money coming from?
- Money?
Around here,
you only supply pocketmoney.
There you are...
The pockets in this household
are fairly deep.
They like
being lined with dirty money.
I only have to make a call,
and Ragnar's out of work.
I want to see you
at my place tomorrow.
After lunch.
- How's the dancing coming along?
- Fine, thank you.
I've seen you rhumba,
that was nice.
-Are you married?
- No, we're not.
We've tried to make a go of it,
but it didn't work out.
-What should I say...
-We're not married.
We're friends.
We've lived together for...
- 15 years.
- 17.
Zac's mother worked with my mother,
and she took me in.
We've been together for 17 years.
What do you do for a living?
-We're artists.
- Painters?
-We're in showbusiness.
- Showbusiness.
We're entertainers, we perform.
We're not entertainers.
We sell different shows.
I'm a singer...
- Ever been on TV?
- Goodness, no.
-Theaters.
- No...
-We perform on stage.
- Like "Riksteatern"?
No, we tour Europe and play...
-They're playing in Jönköping.
-We play clubs.
We tour Europe with a few shows...
One show is the Zacette.
I dress up like a woman...
And I pump up these breasts.
- I have this gorgeous black dress.
-With spangles.
-And end up with a bustline...
- Using balloons.
- Fake eyelashes and a wig.
-Then there's "Fanny by Night".
That's just me and a piano player.
So he earns money without an effort.
Sometimes he watches us, though.
And last month we were on Sicily
and they wanted a show, only not
the Zacette or Fanny by Night.
- So we had to dream something up.
-We didn't know what to tell them.
Then we figured something out.
"Caribbean Nights".
And we decided to have bananas
dangling from our ears.
And I used wires
to hang bananas like this...
- Not just from our ears.
-They were everywhere!
Bananas everywhere. Draped over my
boobs and other strategic sites...
- Huge bananas!
- Bananas hanging in your ears...
That would be perfect on you, Ivar.
- He's a performer, you see.
-A performer?
He dresses up like a woman
and stuffs balloons down his dress
to look like a woman.
-And then...
- But that's... disgusting, Gottfrid.
- Is it really true?
- She's a singer, like Alice.
- Did he show you?
- No.
But it will be interesting to see.
Zac in a dress and all...
-We won't have to see it...
-They told me something else.
They wear bananas in the ears.
-That's pretty funny.
- It's stupid.
That's how they make their living.
Just like you do in the store.
I went through the books
yesterday, and it didn't look good.
I don't think
you can afford Angel Farm.
I know how much money I have.
Listen to me.
I'm not investing
in Angel Farm just for the fun of it.
I need the lumber.
At the prices I'm paying, there's
only work for half my workforce.
-You need capital.
-The bank has faith in me.
You men, just standing
around, doing nothing.
Hello, Mårten.
Here's the deal:
my house needs repairs
and I asked around for help
and I was told that the only man
who could help me was Axel Flogfält.
-What an opportunity.
- I pay well.
Thank you for your kind offer.
Only the way things look,
we won'tbe able to help you.
-Are you finished?
- Soon.
- I'm not in a hurry.
- Beat it.
-Whenever you have the time...
-We're booked until December.
-After December, then.
- 1994.
Oh my, 1994...That's a bit...
I'd be glad to help out,
only I'm hopeless at carpentry.
You've already done so much for me.
You're a sweetheart.
- I'll ask someone else.
- Good luck.
- Have a nice day.
-You too...
The 3,000 you owe me for the books,
could I possibly have them?
-Are we on for tonight?
- I don't think I have the time.
-Are you mad at me?
- No...
You know what Dad's like, I had to go
with him to Angel... I had no choice.
That awful woman...
You're the one I want.
-Will you be on time?
- Of course.
- I'd like to order some wine.
-Again?
-A dozen Sangre de Toro?
- No, Quara Chardonnay.
- Qu... Could you repeat that?
- Quara Chardonnay.
Take Raimat again, only white.
- Is the moped up and running?
-Yes.
- So you'll be delivering?
-You'll have it tomorrow.
I'll pay you then.
If you're planning on calling
that in, I'd like to order some...
-You're buying wine?
- Just order it.
That business
you were discussing with my dad...
-That you needed a hand...
- It was a shame he couldn't help.
I really need it.
I figured I could...
- I could help you out.
-You could?
So you can fix windows?
Climb ladders?
And repair the plumbing?
-You do everything, don't you?
- Not quite.
-What are you doing tonight?
- Nothing...
How about coming over?
We can have a glass a wine.
Mårten can help us out
with the windows.
There are things that need
attending to in my room too.
Guess what your son has done?
Offered that little slut
his services.
That's right.
They were here, in my store,
discussing all sorts of things,
as far as I could hear.
No, I didn't hear everything,
but there were
windows that needed fixing...
And they were going to have wine.
- Cheers.
- Cheers! Welcome.
- It's good.
-A wonderful bouquet.
Look, what do you think?
Isn't that Ivar, and that's Gottfrid?
-That just can't be Gottfrid.
- Because he's thin?
The guy's as skinny as a rail.
You can be skinny when you're young
and just blow up later on.
By next week
you'll look like Birgit Nilsson.
- I swear.
-Who is this?
He looks like Errol Flynn.
Who is that guy?
- It's my dad.
-That's right.
I love looking at pictures.
- Have you seen my mother?
-Alice.
- Isn't she pretty?
-You look alike.
-You in a hurry?
- Of course not.
-The parlor windows leak.
- No problem.
He's the most stubborn
person on the planet.
I'll bet you 500 kronor to prove it.
I'll go ask Gottfrid and Ivar.
That worm over there will show
you which windows need fixing.
Get that money ready
by the time I get back.
So, do you do digging?
Yeah.
Which window are we talking about?
Every last one. I'll show you.
I think every single window
on this floor needs fixing.
Like here, something has to be done.
They leak, and water has pooled...
You might as well inspect the place.
I bet you'll have to...
The worst-looking ones
are up in my room.
What do you say,
shall we go have a look?
Look, it's Ivar.
He looks so cheerful.
- I've never seen him smile.
- He was such a charmer back then.
- He was very fond of your mother.
- He was?
-Any more old pictures...?
-Ask him about that sometime.
See what he says...
I've got a much better picture.
-There aren't any here...
- No, I've looked through those.
What are you doing with my box?
I'm looking
for those pictures from Mullsjö.
Put it back.
- She wanted to see...
- Put it back.
What's wrong
with showing her the pictures?
My pictures are in there too.
- I couldn't find it.
-That's all right. Look...
Isn't this you? Next to a lady.
A lady?
It is you, isn't it?
You were handsome.
-You still are. Who's the lady?
-That's Lena.
Were you going out dancing?
You're all dressed up.
-Was she your sweetheart?
- No...
How many people lived here
during the 50s and early 60s?
-The news is on.
- I couldn't care less.
Ivar, I bet you know how many people
lived here back in the 50s.
Back in the 50s,
how many people lived here?
Something like 1,100 or 1,200.
-And now?
-What's the population now?
You know that as well as I do.
Around 150 to 200...
Are you coming?
There you are...
I need to go out on an errand.
Would you turn that crap off!
Sure, when it's over.
One day one of the customers will
catch you, and then we're through.
- I'll worry about that then.
- People here think you're nice.
But I know what a pervert you are.
Why can't you act normal? Get a girl,
start a family, move away from home!
- Didn't Mårten show up?
-What's he got to do with this?
-You're drenched in perfume.
- Have you counted the till?
-You do it.
- For the second day running?
Why don't you do it instead
of watching...? You're disgusting!
You shouldn't be there,
they're all drug addicts.
They are!
That guyin his leather outfits.
-You might end up a drug addict too.
- I like them, they're good people.
- Better than most people...
-You can't mean that!
Everything's gone to pieces
since they arrived.
The people of this village
don't get along anymore.
They're dangerous,
you could get into trouble.
- Just by fixing windows?
- I've seen it happen.
This is how it is...
I've repaired a few windows.
-You shouldn't be there at all.
- It sure beats being here!
Excuse me, but what's going on?
- I'd rather spend my time there.
- Fine.
Be my guest.
Pack your bags and leave.
Look, it's Ivar!
So happy, you can see his teeth.
Yes, he was
a real charmer, you know.
-He was fond of your mother.
-Really...
Ask him about it sometime.
Excuse me, but I seem
to be playing to myself...
What's so amusing?
Eva told me something funny.
It wasn't funny.
Actually, it was kind of shocking.
It was about Angel Farm...
Britta was in yesterday,
she was upset.
She had been looking for Einar,
who had gone over to Angel Farm.
She found him in a ditch,
covered with mud.
Blind drunk, next to his tractor.
Lying there laughing,
smelling to high heaven with drink.
-They drink.
- So does Einar. Anyone for music?
Henning, please... Could you go
over there and see what's going on?
- Spy on them?
- No, just check out what's going on.
- Sounds like spying to me.
-That would be Ragnar's job.
- Don't send Ragnar over there.
-Why not?
-What are you insinuating?
- Please, Henning?
I've been there,
and they're doing the place proud.
What do you mean?
That old dump?
Right, they're fixing the old dump.
I guess they're going to live there.
- She's Erik's granddaughter.
- She's German, isn't she?
- She should be in Germany.
- Her father must be German.
It makes no difference
if he's an Eskimo!
We need to give them some time.
- It's hard to be a newcomer.
-You were different.
They make people feel uneasy. You
hardly dare let them in the store.
I won't do it.
A vicar shouldn't snoop.
Be a spy...
I refuse to do it. I refuse!
How are the windows coming along?
- Have you been talking to Mårten?
- No.
We haven't gotten started yet.
We need to order new windows first.
You intend to live here?
Yes... No... Perhaps.
I'm just curious.
Once we've made up our minds,
we'll post a flyer down at the ICA.
That should
keep the phone bills down.
I'm just curious about your plans.
Plans? Well the next thing
we'll do is see to the roof.
- It leaks.
- I can't do this...
- I came over to spy on you.
-That was pretty obvious.
You see, Fanny,
when you live in a small place...
...people feel uneasy,
frightened, and worried.
By change.
Just take it slow...
I've had enough of this.
-We only want to fix my house up.
- It's nothing personal...
Everything I do riles people up.
It drives me crazy!
It's making me paranoid.
What's going on?
-They watch me go to the bathroom.
- Knock it off, Fanny!
If they want to talk... I'll give
them something to talk about.
- Collmert...
- It's World War III.
Dad rushes in, dead drunk on gin
bangs his willy on the table
Hot on his heels,
Ma shouts and squeals
telling him he's a damn fool
Don't go and wreck
your little dick, my dear
it's meant for fucking with,
I want to make that clear
Their kids gave a shout
the dog let one out...
And Granny screwed the tomcat!
Go give the little witch
my final offer.
I'll increase it by half a million.
It's a good deal for you too.
How good?
Good enough to get you out of
fucking Anna-Lisa before New Year.
-You've got a lot of heart, Axel.
-True.
It's like I always say...
Around here,
we care about each other.
You care about me
and I care about you.
-Then we'll go do it tomorrow.
- No...
Tonight.
This is exactly what Rut
has been warning us about.
It starts with those two characters
and just gets worse.
-Those people aren't normal.
- I think it's nice.
Oh, so you think it's nice?
Did you see that strange woman?
Really tall, kind of attractive...
until you spot those huge hands.
-Welcome. Cheers!
- Cheers, Ragnar.
-What brings you here?
- Paperwork...
- But I'll come back tomorrow.
- Have a seat.
A nightclub?
I know what tits & ass are,
I was thinking of permits.
But you can help me out, right?
I guess I could.
-Would you like some herring?
- Herring?
No,thanks, I'm fine.
I need to think things over.
I think I'm going to move.
Or sell the house, because...
It's not worth all this trouble.
-You don't need to leave.
-Yes, I do.
I don't fit in here.
I feel so...
It's all so...
It all hits me now that I'm here.
I don't want to know...
Only now I have to figure it out.
Don't mind them,
they're being stupid.
But I've been mean too.
I tease people.
I've even teased Ragnar.
I don't know who my friends are
anymore, I don't know a thing...
There's something I'd like...
I'd like you to see this.
Angel Farm is going
to be a night club. A brothel.
A whorehouse?
- Here?
-That's right.
-Who told you that?
- Eva.
Ragnar found out about it.
Is it really true?
And what are you
going to do about it?
Well, Rut,what can I do?
I'll be the only vicar
with a parish whorehouse.
Don't make jokes, this is serious.
Just look at this!
They're all drug addicts!
- Leave this to Ragnar.
- Don't discuss this with Ragnar.
- Let me handle it.
- Go on, knock.
You can leave if you like.
- Knock louder.
- Here she comes.
Just look at the way she's dressed!
- I'm going to have a look.
Look, here they are.
Look at them. You can see
for yourselves that they're...
Is this a brothel? What kind of
people are you? Foreigners?
I know your kind...
Gottfrid, what are you doing here?
Shame on you!
- Come here this instant!
- Embarrassing Eva like that!
What are you doing here? -They've
made Gottfrid sit on the sofa.
The entire village
will go to the dogs!
I'll have you know that coming
here with your big cityways...
Wipe that smirk off your face!
You think you're so special!
But we villagers stick together!
That's how it's been for generations,
and that won't change.
That's our way!
You want to open a brothel with
striptease dancing and corsets...
And drugs too, I bet.
Like I've seen on TV.
And this lot... Negroes.
-A bunch of foreigners.
- Shut up!
- I'll have you know...
- Shut up!
Don't you order me around,
you little slut!
I talked to her, but she wouldn't
listen. There was a party going on.
I can't make her listen,
I don't control her.
That's it. I'm through with you.
And I'll make sure that goes
for everyone in town too.
If you have any brains at all
you'll go see that little cow
and have her make you the doorman.
- She'd pay me better than you do.
-You'd fit in with the trash there!
Well, thank you, Axel!
It'll be a relief
to get out of your clutches!
You fucking bastard!
You have no business being here!
We've gotten along
just fine on our own.
And now you want to get our men to
come here and sleep with these tarts!
Just look at them,
they're a bunch of trash!
Compare them to the folks
that have lived here for generations.
We don't want you here.
You're not welcome here.
That was upsetting...
And they won't leave?
They're planning on staying.
-They've got to go.
-Axel!
I wish Angel Farm would burn in hell!
-What did she say?
- Goodbye, I hope we meet again.
I'm sorry about
that business with Rut.
- Don't let it bother you.
- I wish everyone was like you.
-Want me to walk you home?
- No, I can handle Ivar.
- Goodbye.
- I'll drop by tomorrow.
- I hope it won't rain.
- I don't think it will.
See you tomorrow.
A certain force will help you
recognize your neighbor... love.
And why...
am I speaking of such matters?
The answer is obvious.
Our community...
is in the grips of fear.
Fear of the unknown.
Fear of what is foreign to us,
of things unfamiliar...
Fear of things that would,
if we let them, enrich our lives.
We must bypass the outer trappings
to find the person underneath.
Break through that shell!
Jesus befriended people
who were despised as outcasts.
He looked down on no man.
Sit down!
We're leaving.
Houses and wealth
are inherited from parents...
But a prudent wife is from the Lord.
Proverbs 19:14.
That lousy old bastard!
I've had it up to here with him!
I'm sick of this place, old bats
poking their noses into everything.
If you open a beer on a Wednesday,
the grapevine goes nuts.
Are you listening to me?
Any of it sinkin, you idiot?
You were in church, those two were
the only ones acting normal...
If Mr. Leather showed up now, it
would be the last thing he ever did.
- Get my drift?
-You are one sick bastard.
I'm getting out of here.
-Where would you go?
-Anywhere.
I could head for Göteborg...
What's so funny?
-What would you do in Göteborg?
-Anything, I don't care.
I could be a bus driver...
for starters.
Good. A bus driver.
You know how to drive a bus.
But what about the tickets
and dealing with the passengers?
This is what we need right now.
We need to meet on neutral ground,
look each other in the eye...
You're absolutely daffy,
but I like you.
It's a great suggestion,
but I seriously doubt it will work.
It's vital that you,
Zac, Axel and Rut are there.
If you can pull it off,
I'll be there.
- It's not impossible.
- Good luck.
- It's a brilliant idea, Henning.
- Of course it is.
Only we've been through WorldWar III
today, so we're reeling.
Make Rut and Axel come.
- Leave Axel to me.
-And I'll provide dessert.
Don't worry,
everything will be fine.
Don't you turn your back on me!
You thick-headed yokel!
I'm sick of cleaning up your messes!
I'm sick of cleaning up
after countrybumpkins!
Standing there in church,
going on about neighbors...
Just who are the outsiders here?
And who do you think you are?
Tell me!
You know what? You're scared,
and you don't understand a thing!
You don't even realize that this
means you'll never get Angel Farm.
I didn't figure you had balls,
Henning...
But I guess the Lord
moves in mysterious ways.
So be there...
...yokel.
Thank you for coming here tonight.
Well, I hope you've had
your fill of food and drink.
Now it's time to feed your soul.
We have put together a performance.
A small... show.
And the opening act is Sigfried,
also known as Siggy!
Dear God...
- Good job!
-You didn't mention the chainsaw.
-Where are you headed?
-Angel Farm.
-What are you going to do there?
- Make a delivery.
We're going to see the cabaret.
-What are you delivering?
- Gasoline.
-What for?
-To torch Angel Farm.
-What?
- Rut wants the place in ashes.
So the place will be torched
and you're not going to spoil things.
Stop the car, Per-Ove.
Stop the car, I've got to think.
I really don't think
my mother meant that literally.
Think I was born yesterday?
I know what people mean
when they say things.
She meant what she said,
and you're not going to stop me.
And if you try,
it will be the last thing you do.
- Okay, but I need to take a leak.
-After we set the fire.
I need to go
before I can do anything.
You doing it in the car?
Say it with music
and leave out the words
Words tend to come out too harsh
While a song is to me
more than anything else
A way to express our love...
Hey, stop!
Are you going to screw this up?
Let go of me, damn it!
-What a fucking waste!
-You bloody idiot!
Well then...
I've behaved badly
during your stay.
And I sincerely
want to apologize for that.
That's not necessary.
You see...
...that I...
I was very fond of Alice.
And she was very fond of me.
Get moving, you dickhead!
Oh dear...
I'm not sure how to put this.
Alice and I were together....
In every sense, you see...
So...
-What the hell have you done?
- Me?
I could have caught on fire!
Don't touch me, stay away!
- Fucking moron.
-You're a loser.
What's that smell?
What's going on?
Where have you been?
Sit down.
You missed the grand finale.
Some maniac
set fire to Olsson's fields.
Bless you.
- Four acres of good wheat.
- It's gasoline...
-Where have you been?
-The Land Rover broke down...
-The tank leaked.
- But it's been fixed, right?
-Temporarily.
- How did you fix it?
- I had this rubber hose.
- It was in the back.
-That was resourceful of you.
You liar...
It was his idea, I tried to stop him
and grabbed the gas cans...
-You set the fire?
- It was an accident.
-What was the gas for?
-Ask him.
That idiot was
going to torch Angel Farm.
You were going
to set Angel Farm on fire.
Why?
Rut said
she wanted to see it burnt down.
Are you out of your mind, boy?
I didn't mean it like that.
-That's what you said.
- Be quiet.
No one was doing anything.
Not you.
Not Rut...
And not Henning,
so it was up to me.
And it would have gone well
if it hadn't been for that asshole!
He messed it up.
I don't know how many times I've
been out in front of the ICA store
and people have said: "Axel, do
something about your nephew."
"He's not quite right in the head."
And I've told them
there's nothing wrong with you.
But I was wrong...
You aren't quite right,
you're nuts.
You're off your rocker, a criminal.
See you tomorrow.
Shall we try
to leave on Monday morning?
If the headstone is ready.
It is, I went over there today.
I don't want to go.
I can't cancel one more time.
No one will book us
if we keep on canceling.
We don't have to work.
We could sell the woods.
-The woods belong to you.
-And you.
I want to work, you know.
It would do you good too,
calm you down.
Yeah...You're right.
- Planning on changing your mind?
- No.
What's wrong?
Has something happened?
I'll tell you another day.
-You know, that was a cheap shot.
-What do you mean?
Singing our song
instead of apologizing.
- Didn't you like it?
-You know how to reduce me to tears.
Are you still up?
I was down at the pasture,
checking on Rondo's foal.
He seems better.
He's started
pawing his foreleg a little...
Sit down, Axel.
What's that? I fit's from the bank,
I made a deposit this morning.
It's not from the bank.
Berlin...
What's this?
'63... Berlin, March, 14, 1963...
Dear Axel,
I'm not sure how to put this,
but there's something
you need to know.
I'm pregnant,
and you're the father.
I'm going to keep it.
But I have no desire
to be a home-wrecker.
The best thing for all of us
is that I leave this place.
Alice.
I opened it by accident.
Forgive me.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?
It only happened once.
I never knew...
You do now.
When we gathered
here a few months ago,
to pay our respects to Erik Zander.
We believed
that the Zander line had died out.
But then, from out of nowhere,
she appeared, Fanny...
And we had an
unforgettable summer.
I believe I speak for us all
when I say
that we feel a sense of loss
now that you are leaving us today.
Don't forget us.
We'll be back.
I've been told that Alice
enjoyed singing in church
so we will sing her favorite hymn:
A Summer Song.
-What's that all about?
- Nothing...
By next summer she'll be on her back.
- Guess who will be on top?
- Seen Theresa Orlowski?
Don't look around,
she's a Polish porno star.
What did you say?
- She's letting me buy the woods.
- Right, and...?
Nothing.
I was stunned.
Go tell Fanny.
- Couldn't it wait?
- I've waited for 30 years now!
Go to Fanny and tell her.
There was something else...
Rut felt...
I didn't manage to say it...
You don't have to,
I already know.
- I've read the letter.
-You've read the letter...?
- Rut brought it over.
- I see.
Well then...
Have you told anyone?
It might be better if we kept it
to ourselves a while longer.
I can't picture myself shouting out
the news that you're my dad.
You do want the woods,
don't you?
-What price did we agree on?
-Thirteen.
- More like 12.5, as I recall.
-You raised it 500,000.
You want to keep
the house and the grounds.
Eleven is more reasonable.
-Why so much money?
-Why all those trees?
You're like your mother,
in many ways.
-Who wants to take the keys?
- Leave them to me.
Here's the address to our next stop.
And our phone number in Berlin.
Dial all the digits, you don't
have to wait for a dialtone.
Just dial all the digits.
If we move, we'll be in touch.
-When will you be back?
- By Christmas.
We'll have the road cleared for you.
Roads cleared and the house heated.
- Look, it's that green stuff.
-We've saved it for you.
One for the road...
I bet a lot of people
will be relieved to see us go.
-This calls for a speech.
-We'd like to hear a speech.
This is it: Drive carefully,
your cargo is valuable.
Cheers... and thank you.
Bye, Eva!
You take the keys.
So... now summer's over.
It's the best summer
I've had since I was a boy.
Did you talk to her?
Yes, we talked a few nights ago.
-What did she say?
- I told her about Alice...
About how we had been sweethearts.
And the girl is...
So you're her father?
You know what? It looks like rain.
