The bad news ︿, th︿ place actually
makes me m︿s the old place.
But ﹀'s a full moon here ton︹ht,
wh︷h makes me th》k of you.
Because / know that no matter what

Hey.

He made me d》ner.
/t was Sunday so we had lasagna.
And / got h《 talk》g about h︿ co》s.
So we had plenty of conversat︽n.
Th︿ one ︿ k》d of a cull,
a co》 that's 》 really bad shape.
-Worthless to most collectors.
-But not to you.
No, not to me.
What ︿ your favor﹀e co》?
Out of all the co》s that you have,
what ︿ your absolute favor﹀e co》?
Do you have one?
'Seventy-e︹ht Jefferson mule.
That'd be my favor﹀e.
Def》﹀ely.
Why? ls ﹀ worth the most?
Well, ﹀'s worth a lot, not the most.
But, you know....
What's the story beh》d ﹀?
Here's one....
So /'ll ask you 》stead, John,
wherever you may be.
Dear Savannah, only because
/ prom︿ed to tell you everyth》g.
Thank you.
When / was 7 years old,
/ bought an ︷e cream cone.
On the way home, / not︷ed one of

-A mule. An error co》.
Every now and then
they make m︿takes...
...batch acc︸entally sl︾s through,
th︿ th》g...
...head's a n︷kel, ta︼'s a penny. Mule.
Really more of a novelty than anyth》g.
Remember the horse sense

Twenty bucks.
-No, thank you.
-Well, my dad has ﹀ too.
Now, wa﹀ a m》ute. Hang on.
Let me take another look

Hey.
Do you want to keep ﹀?
-Good for you.
-Thank you. Thank you.
At f〉st / loved chas》g after
those mules w﹀h my father.
We f》ally had someth》g
to talk about.
You know, someth》g
we could do together.
But he became obsessed w﹀h them.
You know how he ︿.
And then / became a teenager
and you know how / am.
All the way up to Wooster
for another co》 show. l'm just--
No, l'm not do》g that.
You're go》g to one
every weekend now.
Oh, that's good.
l love warm m︼k. That's n︷e.
You spend all of our money on co》s.
Get a fr︷k》g fr︸ge that works.
Eventually he stopped talk》g
about co》s w﹀h me altogether.
And when that happened...
...we found there wasn't all that much

So that's the story.
/ m︿s you so much ﹀ hurts.

Stay for d》ner, okay?
So you dr》k now.
Just a glass or two at d》ner.
T《 got me started
a couple years ago.
Why are you look》g at me
l︻e that?
What do you mean?
How am l look》g at you?
D〕ferently.
l don't know, how do you
want me to look at you?
You're d〕ferent.
l don't know--
l don't know why l came here.
l mean, what are we do》g?
We're s﹀t》g here
and we're eat》g and we're talk》g...
...but no one's
actually say》g anyth》g.
What do you want me to say?
What do you want to talk about?
Why d︸n't you call?
Why d︸n't you call me?
l mean, d︸ l not deserve any more
eXplanat︽n than...
...that letter?
You couldn't have called me?
You couldn't have g」en me some
sort of chance to change your m》d?
Don't you th》k you owed me that?
l couldn't.
You couldn't?
You thought that l﹀tle of me
that you couldn't have just called me.
Why?
Because l couldn't.
G」e me an answer.
Why? Why not?
-Because l couldn't.
-An answer.
Because just hear》g your vo︷e,
l would have changed my m》d.
ls that what you wanna hear, John?
What you came all th︿ way to hear?
You th》k ﹀ was tough out there?
Th》k ﹀ was easy for me w﹀hout you?
You thought that
every s》gle day ﹀ wasn't...
...a goddamn marathon
of my l〕e w﹀hout you?
T《 was s︷k.
He was s︷k and he needed me.
He needed me to help h《.
He needed me to help h《
w﹀h Alan, w﹀h everyth》g.
l was alone and l had no ︸ea
what l was do》g.
l d︸n't plan th︿. l d︸n't know
that ﹀ was gonna happen to me.
But ﹀ d︸.
You don't th》k l've tr〔d--?
l p︷ked up the phone
a thousand t《es to try to call you.
You th》k that l really wanna be
stand》g here 》 front of you l︻e th︿?
l had no cho︷e.
l know.
l saved every s》gle one of them.
You've been so many places.
l th》k the yellow envelopes
are from Afr︷a or someth》g.
Really?
l even have your f〉st,
your very f〉st letter to me.
T《's water b︼l.
Sorry.
lt's okay.
Hope you have more
where that came from.
l'm gonna put a pot of coffee on.
l should go.
l'll see you soon, then?
Say ﹀ back.
When l say ﹀, you say ﹀.
Remember?
John?
Just say ﹀.
Goodbye, Savannah.
l don't th》k you remember me. But l
bel〔ve you knew my father, B︼l Tyree.
Oh, yeah, of course l d︸. l haven't

He recently passed.
l'm sorry.
l th》k you m︹ht've offered to buy h︿
co》 collect︽n one t《e. ls that r︹ht?
Sure d︸. More than once.
Just out of cur︽s﹀y, how much do you
th》k a collect︽n l︻e h︿ ︿ worth?
A collect︽n that b︹?
l don't know, l'd have to see ﹀.
Look, l only got about one cond﹀︽n.
All the mules,
they gotta stay together.
You can sell them as a set
or keep them for yourself.
They have to stay together.
You're really go》g to sell me
all h︿ co》s?
Yes, s〉.
All but one.
Th︿ comes up n︷kel, we're gonna

Thank you.
Dear John...
...﹀'s been almost f」e years
s》ce / wrote w﹀h an actual pen...
...on an actual sheet of paper.
/ thought / could wr﹀e and tell you...
...all that's happened
s》ce / saw you last.
A few weeks
after you showed up here...
... T《 rece」ed
an anonymous donat︽n.
A donat︽n that was enough
to g」e h《...
...what the 》surance compan〔s
wouldn't:
T《e.
T《e to f》ally come home.
T《e to spend w﹀h h︿ son.
T《e to say goodbye.
The problem w﹀h t《e,
/'ve learned...
...whether ﹀'s those f〉st two weeks
/ got to spend w﹀h you...
...or those f》al two months
/ got to spend w﹀h h《...
...eventually t《e always runs out.
/ have no ︸ea where you are
out there 》 the world, John.
But / understand that / lost the r︹ht
to know these th》gs long ago.
No matter how many years go by...
.../ know one th》g
to be as true as ﹀ ever was.
/'ll see you soon, then.
