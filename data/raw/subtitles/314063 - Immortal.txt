Condemned to death
by his peers for rebellion,
horus from hierakonopolis,
the god of heavens,
has seven days to see the
earth of mankind once more...
the earth he helped create.
Seven days... time for
one beat of the divine heart,
not a second more,
before being deprived
of his immortality.
But even the gods fear death.
- Heru.
- Meru.
Make the most of
your last moments.
Seven days, horus!
Seven hourglasses.
Not a second more.
Trust me.
I know you're there.
Hey! Look over there!
I'll zoom in on it!
What the hell? Is a naked
guy with a birïs head!
Unbelievable!
Hey, whas going on?
Pull up! Pull up!
Children...
my human children.
I'm back.
I'm also in charge of
the nano implants department
but we concentrate more
on synthetic skin.
No hard feelings, then?
Thank you for reminding me.
Can i take two?
No.
Only one this time.
No hard feelings, but
you're still tight-fisted.
Fuck you, elma.
You should be
so lucky.
That girl's
dangerous.
She must be on
pretty powerful stuff.
She damaged her carrier
when they selected them.
When they rounded
them up, you mean.
Thas why i'm
interested in her.
You're involved in illegal
medicine more than ever.
Resistance medicine.
There's a difference.
You really like her,
don't you?
I'm taking her with me.
I'll need antibiotics,
even old ones.
And micro-needles.
Not so fast, darling.
I want a detailed report
of all the analyses
you perform on her.
And don't try to pretend
you've "lost" the file.
You can have her,
but i want the file.
Professor lubitsch
to operating theater 212.
His mother's being
treated at eugenics.
He's waiting for her
to be returned to him.
How old are you?
Les go.
But to openly accuse
senator allgood
of manipulating
public opinion.
Did he organize the pyramid
affair to get elected?
No, his influence
doesn't run that deep.
Is obvious that the pyramid
is extraterrestrial,
like the intrusion zone
in central park.
I don't agree with
the view that
intrusion is a matrix
of dangerous mutants.
That rumor was spread
by allgood
to serve the interests
of eugenics.
Scientists have proved
that intrusion
is a gateway
to parallel
or extraterrestrial worlds.
We'll have to accept we're
not alone in the universe.
But in practical terms
your program doesn't
seem very satisfactory.
You put all the blame
on senator allgood.
I'm also talking about
the medical dictatorship
that allgood has imposed
on new york city
with the active participation
of eugenics.
I'm talking about raids,
illegal experiments,
unauthorized blood tests,
and organ removal.
People going missing.
I'm talking about globus i.
You know what that is,
don' t you?
Is the freezer used
by the mad scientists
that work for eugenics.
Don't you agree there's
a real security problem?
That series of murders
on level 2.
Thas police business.
I have full confidence
in the federal police.
What a bitch!
What a bitch!
A bitch... but a fast
learner about politics.
Thas what i mean...
a whore.
Thas enough.
About those murders...
how many have been
reported so far?
Four.
Who's in charge
of the case?
Inspector froebe, a specialist
in the abnormal.
He thinks is the work
of a serial killer.
Froebe is no specialist.
Hunting is all
he lives for,
ever since he had his face
chewed on by the dayak.
He's a real psychopath.
He's a liability.
I don't agree,
miss liang.
Froebe is a good cop.
Anyway he's politically neutral.
Neutral?
Neutral doesn't exist.
There's only men and women,
humans and aliens.
The integrated
and the rejected.
The whole fucking universe
is split in two.
That makes five
in less than 48 hours.
Thas got to be a record.
Exactly the same m.o.
Is just as if the body
had exploded from the inside.
I was told
there was a witness.
He's right over there,
waiting for you.
Back at my office
in an hour.
I'll see you at froebe's, ok?
Are you all right?
Yeah. All right.
I'll see you there.
Are you sure
you're all right?
Unit 1-7,
are you receiving this?
Unit 1-7, will you respond?
Unit 1-7?
Hi.
What can i get you?
He wants to know
if they're diseased.
He asked you a question.
I'm fine, thanks.
All your organs?
I changed my lungs.
They're a chinese model.
Not bad.
Pretty attractive.
And i have a new bladder, too.
No problem there.
Still don't want a drink?
Huh?
Six?
No, seven.
Outside the bar.
The witness.
The one i never
got to see.
The giant.
He's the seventh.
The agent who was supposed to
bring him to you was the sixth.
Reminds you of the dayaks,
doesn't it?
Cold-blooded carnage.
Right up their alley.
The dayaks are extinct.
They were exterminated after
the riots, 30 years ago.
Except the one
that got you.
Thank you, sandy.
Is not going to hold,
but i can't do
anything anymore.
I did warn you.
Only 35% of your original
metabolism remains.
You've modified
or replaced the rest.
I have a contract
with eugenics.
I had guessed that much.
Tell my colleague
i sent you.
He's a specialist in
nano-surgical repairs.
Don't leave it too long.
Thank you, doctor.
I'm so sorry, jill.
New yorkers all seem
to have gone insane.
Where was i?
Ah, yes,
the lapse in your memory.
I was wondering what you don't
want to remember so badly
that you're this blocked.
To put it another way...
what are you trying to forget?
I can't remember anything.
There's a subtle difference.
But it seems that
you remembered to take
strong doses of potentially
dangerous substances
as yet unidentified.
Do you have any on you?
Is your supplier
on level 3?
In little paris?
Amongst the non-humans?
What have you got
against non-humans?
Some of them are
very decent beings.
You, for example.
I have to tell you that,
in 20 years of medicine,
i've never seen a guinea pig
quite like you.
I've never seen such a heart,
lungs, or a womb like that.
Never.
You're built like someone born
less than three months ago.
Maybe thas what
you want to forget.
Or what you're
not sure about.
When did you get
to new york?
And how?
Some vertebrate animals
on this planet
shed their skin.
You are going through
the same process.
Listen to my offer.
Work for me.
Let me conduct a thorough
medical examination.
Take some samples,
test some medication.
If you trust me, you won't
have anything to worry about.
You'll be covered and legal.
More importantly,
i'll get you a card.
I have a contract with
the western hysteria.
You can live there.
You're the greatest mystery
of nature i've ever come across.
Danger for humans.
Don't step on level 3.
Danger for humans.
John...
i got picked up in a eugenics
raid. We shot a carrier.
It could have gone very badly.
A human woman doctor saved me.
She offered me a job
and legal housing.
Accept it.
As a guinea pig.
Apparently, my body
is only three months old,
and my organs aren't
in the right place.
Not in the right place?
According to
whose criteria?
You see that
pyramid monument?
Do you think
is in the right place?
And me?
Do you think i am?
There's something important
you should know.
This planet is
rejecting me, jill.
This atmosphere,
this oxygen...
is burning me up.
I have to take care of you
before is too late.
I'm getting old, jill.
I've been around
for centuries.
I'm confused.
Ok, les go.
Oh, my god!
Jesus!
Hey, this one's empty.
Keep back!
Restricted area.
A flying pyramid,
a serial killer on the loose,
and now, a chunk of
prison falling from the sky.
Is someone out to sabotage
my political career?
Is almost like
a greek tragedy, senator.
All the elements
will fall into place.
What are you doing here,
inspector froebe?
I'm looking for three of my men
who have disappeared.
Your serial killer, again?
I don't think so.
Here, a gift for you.
What is it?
You should know
better than me.
Give me that! This is
out of your league.
I haven't found the man
who goes with this.
"Remember..."
"remember the sight
we saw, my soul,
that beautiful soft
summer morning..."
"round a turning
in the path..."
thank you.
"A disgusting carcass
on a bed
scattered with stones,
its legs in the air,
like a woman in heat."
"Remember the sight
we saw, my soul,
that beautiful,
soft summer morning.
Round a turning
in the path,
a disgusting carcass on a bed
scattered with stones,
its legs in the air
like a woman in heat,
burning and sweating poisons,
like a fountain with
its rhythmical sobs.
I can hear it clearly flowing
with a long murmuring sound.
But i touch my body in vain
to find the wound.
I am the vampire
of my own heart,
one of the great outcasts
condemned to eternal laughter,
who can no longer smile."
Am i dead?
I must be dead.
And you...
i know you.
Horus from hierakonopolis,
the god of the heavens.
I'm flattered, nikopol,
wretched human.
Anubis can't be far away.
The guardian of the tombs,
the god of the dead.
Don't ever speak
that jackal's name again.
You understand?
Only my name.
Only me.
Ok, ok.
My leg!
Where is my leg?
You can see
you're not dead.
The dead don't feel pain.
The dead don't bleed either.
Yeah, i'm alive...
and i'm bleeding like a pig.
Listen carefully.
I won't say it twice.
For two of your days,
i have been looking
for a host body, for reasons
that go far beyond
any human concerns.
I need a body to welcome me
and serve me.
You... you seem to be suitable.
I've tested seven humans
and rejected them all.
But you...
your body is clean.
You come from the past.
30 years of hibernation.
Your body won't reject me.
We are compatible.
What year is it?
Who set me free?
2,095 after
your jesus christ.
Your release
is an accidental escape.
I was supposed to be out
in 2,096.
I was released a year
ahead of schedule.
I've gained a year,
but i've lost a leg.
Fuck!
Forget the old one.
Here's a new one.
Yeah...
thank you for calling.
That was the forensic
scientist from globus.
And?
The leg
has been identified.
And?
Well, it belongs to...
nikopol.
Perfect!
There's no way!
This thing... weighs a ton.
I'll never be able to move.
Thas right.
Without me, you won't
be able to move.
And, by the way,
from now on,
you won't be able to do
much of anything without me.
I accept that
i'm not dead now,
but i hope i'm dreaming this.
God, let this be a nightmare.
Let this all be a nightmare.
You believe in god?
I don't even have that
to fall back on.
I suggest you
believe in me, nikopol.
Do i have a choice?
I'm afraid not.
Now, rise... and walk.
I've relinquished
control, nikopol.
You can have a bit
of autonomy now.
I want you to know everything
is going perfectly well.
Your body is comfortable
and tolerates me beautifully.
And, above all,
you're most elegant.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Elegant, famous,
and subversive.
Just what i like.
It seems
you're the instigator
of all this fighting thas
been going on without you.
Not bad, for a human.
Would it be too much to ask
for a bit more autonomy?
I'd like to choose my clothes
with the free will i have.
Your happiness
is my priority...
mr. Free spirit.
How is dr. Elma turner?
Never been better.
Welcome to
the western hysteria hotel.
39th floor, room 12.
Any friend of dr. Turner's
is welcome.
Por ti ketro.
Thas for me?
Thanks.
Whas your name?
Willy-katarakado-willy...
willy? Ok.
I'll call you willy.
And you can call me jill.
Temperature 44.2.
Number of teeth: 37.
All incisors.
No mammal dental plates.
Profile unknown.
Thank you, jill. Now
you can make the food test.
With the list getting
longer, 8 victims, all male,
in less than 72 hours,
a macabre new record.
This just in, senator
allgood has announced
he will be on the zeppelin
when the delegation
and leading egyptologists
make another attempt
to contact the inhabitants
of the pyramid.
The hydrometer rate
is down in brooklyn again.
On intrusion, however,
no change.
Snow, ice... temperature
23 below freezing.
12 attempted break-ins
have been recorded.
There are no survivors.
Do not approach
the central park area.
Stop!
Down!
Everybody down!
Watch out!
Move! Move!
Are we cheating
or not, bastet?
We're cheating,
anubis, we're cheating.
You don't understand.
Nikopol is alive.
Maybe not.
It was reported
he was shot by
a security guard
and fell 100 meters.
But they couldn't
find the body...
you're telling me
the man can fly?
Huxley is froebe's
right-hand man...
thanks, jonas. You
can leave us now.
Right. Get the hell
out of here. Beat it!
He knows everything!
I know
he knows everything.
His phenomenal memory is
stuffed with enough evidence
concerning your late father's
financial dealings
and his illegal experiments
on alien populations
to cause eugenics
some very serious problems.
I'm aware of that.
Until now, we've had the spirit
of nikopol to deal with.
But now we have him,
flesh and blood.
No one's ever come back
from globus.
Well, he has.
Why wasn't he executed
30 years ago anyway?
Are you crazy?
Make him a hero? A martyr
to the lousy revolution?
What do you want?
Riots? Assassinations?
This is the last prototype
of the "hunter" version.
Fast, ferocious,
and totally illegal.
He'll be quicker
than froebe and his men.
Are you sure?
No. But is
the only solution...
apart from your protege.
No, not him.
Les try
this way first.
Come in.
You're early.
We have no time to lose.
Is he ready? Have you
reactivated him yet?
No. I'll need about an hour.
I wanted to make sure
you really wanted him.
We do.
Ok.
Whas this?
What happened?
Nothing of any
importance, really.
Nothing.
Do you like women?
Women?
Women.
My most beautiful
and most important
creation on this planet.
Your story doesn't
make much sense.
You're looking for a blue-haired
girl with white skin.
How do you know
she comes here?
In the same way
that i knew i'd find her
on planet earth
in new york city.
Intuition, nikopol.
The intuition of the gods.
So, whas so special
about her
that warrants
such a display of talent?
Is she miss universe...
or what?
You don't think
i've come all this way
for a mere human being,
do you?
Now i'll know
more about you.
Why are you doing
all this for me?
Is a political
and social fight.
My spirit of nikopol
coming out.
Besides, your case
interests me.
I think you like me.
Isn't that what
you were thinking?
You could say that.
How did you guess?
Do you read minds, too?
You could say that.
I do like you,
and i feel close to you.
Whoever you are...
mutant or whatever,
although you are beginning
to scare me.
Les try an experiment
to test your talent.
I'll think of a question,
and you'll answer,
ready?
Ready.
I've asked the question.
You want to know if
i've started testing the foods
you prescribed for me,
if i took a blood test,
and if i took notes.
Answer: Yes.
I did everything
i was supposed to do,
and i found everything
absolutely delicious.
I'm a professional
guinea pig.
You tasted everything?
For dinner, yes.
I ate it all.
Everything at once?
In the prescribed quantities?
I weighed everything.
I just changed a couple
of the recipes.
I didn't have
anything to cook with,
so i ate the monkfish raw.
And the lamb, too.
They're not bad together.
How many meals
do you have a day?
Two a week.
She's not bad.
Not surprising,
you idiot.
She's the one.
John?
Come, jill, come.
You'll be my last and
most beautiful intrusion.
Listen carefully.
For thousands of earth years,
i've been introducing people
into the four corners
of the galaxy...
people misplaced by
the vagaries of the universe.
You're a misplaced person, jill.
And i'll never know
your origins.
You appeared deep
in the heart of intrusion.
Thas where
i took charge of you.
The blue pills stop your past
from emerging
and let the present invade you.
Your metamorphosis is
on the verge of completion.
From now on, your place
is on this planet.
What about you?
Aren't you staying?
I'm a passer
at the end of his cycle.
I'm already dreaming
of a void.
I'm afraid.
Afraid of what?
Of becoming human.
Tell me about your job
with dr. Elma turner.
Can i buy you a drink?
Don't you think
i have enough already?
I don't see any cognac
or sake,
tequila... slivovitsa...
i'm working.
Do you mind?
A vodka. Make it
a tarkovskaia, please.
I like your hair.
Is very nice.
It goes very well with...
white skin.
Is it a new thing in make-up?
Kabuki style, maybe?
You must be an actress.
You're expecting
something from me.
The answer is no.
You're going to need someone
to take you home.
What makes you think that?
You have no other choice.
One for the road.
I like... this one.
How about you,
young lady?
We are going
to get along fine.
Is very important
to have the same tastes.
No.
We've got more important things
to do than fight each other.
Address?
Western hysteria hotel.
You are inspector
john emerson huxley,
and you have a black box
in your brain.
Give it to me, please,
or i'll have to
go in and take it.
It goes very well
with... white skin.
D is june in january d
d because i'm in love d
d i'm really in love d
d but only because
i'm in love with you d
d so in love, so in love d
d so in love,
so in love d
d and i can feel
the scent of roses d
d in the air d
d is june in january dd
i don't have a room.
Which level
are you from?
I'm above levels.
This is level two,
and the hotel's full.
The hotel, maybe.
But your bed is not.
Ladies first.
Control, miss.
Your papers.
My papers?
Your card, if you prefer?
Thank you. Miss.
Do you have any weapons?
Explosives?
Any history of
violent conduct?
I hate violence.
Are you
comfortable here?
Yes, fine.
Yes, i hate violence,
but i do like to caress
myself with bird feathers.
Preferably,
black ones.
Is a bit small,
isn't it?
Don't you have
a bathroom?
No. No bathroom.
I've decided
never to wash again.
Ever.
Who are you?
This is my bathroom!
What are you doing
in my bathroom?
Who are you?
We had a drink
together last night.
You had several. Is not
surprising you can't remember.
Alcohol has no effect on me.
Whas happening here?
What about the door?
That door wasn't there
a moment ago.
Did you do that?
I'm no carpenter.
Be careful. Those things
can go off by themselves.
Shut up, human!
What happened last night?
What did you do to my body?
So?
What did i do to your body?
We had sexual intercourse,
you and i.
Well, maybe not just
the two of us alone.
What do you mean by
"sexual intercourse"?
At times last night,
you gave the impression
you knew perfectly well.
I wi...
i could tell you the truth.
What truth?
Bloody fucking god!
What did you make me do?!
Fuck you.
What are we
waiting for?
The answers to the questions
i asked him.
He can hardly talk anymore,
but we may be able to
piece together
recent events
from his subconscious.
Can he be... repaired?
He can be treated.
A dayak?
A fake.
A replica
of a dayak, humanized.
We found some synthetic
red epidermis...
signed eugenics...
under his fingernails.
Leave us now.
Rape.
Rape?
You made me
commit rape.
She consented.
We gods have physical
appetites, you know,
which we have
aptly demonstrated
for thousands of years.
You really are a piece of shit!
You think everything
is yours for the taking.
My body...
that girl's body.
All those
you murdered.
We'll do it your way
next time, if you wish.
Next time?
Do what my way?
Next time
we make love to her.
We must make love again
with that young lady.
No way!
Don't you like her?
I'm not sharing my body
anymore. Is that clear?
Not for fucking
or anything else.
Thas the end
of the line.
You go your way.
I'll go mine.
Nikopol, nikopol...
you're talking as if
you had the choice.
You can walk perfectly
normally, if i want you to.
But if i don't...
don't forget this either.
Fuck you!
Right. But les fuck her
again first.
Can you describe him?
Rather average.
From what i can remember.
Human looking.
What about his... penis?
Human looking, too?
Have you had relations
of this nature before?
Relations?
Mm-hmm.
Human... social?
Sexual.
Intercourse...
i think you've experienced it,
but you don't remember.
The drugs, the pills.
Whoever's treating you,
it shows.
Even your organs
are positioning
themselves correctly.
Thank you for trusting me.
I trust john.
Only john.
Are you testing me?
Is that it?
Thas him.
I recognize him.
And thas the girl.
This is all we've
kept of her.
Her lachrymose
secretions.
That should be enough.
This kind of dayak has
olfactory capabilities
500 times
superior to ours.
My favorite
moving molecular lab.
He's a real hunter.
You taste good.
I'm proud of myself
for having found you.
Tell me where i can find
the one who's with you.
Who are you talking about?
You'd better know
who i'm talking about.
Shhh...
jill has been through
some difficult moments.
I've had to erase
them from her memory.
We must protect her
and love her.
We must impregnate her.
So thas it?
Can i count on you,
nikopol?
I knew i could.
"Ceaselessly by my side
moves the demon.
He swims around me
like impalpable air.
I swallow and feel it
burn my lungs
and fill them with
eternal desire and guilt."
Already here?
You really don't have
anywhere else to go.
I really
don't have the choice.
I only have you.
Are you feeling all right?
Shouldn't i be?
Been in a fight?
There's a blank
in my memory.
Maybe you're the one
who hit me.
Why did you spend
30 years in hibernation?
Afraid of growing older?
How do you know that?
I can mind-read a bit,
but i don't understand yours.
I know you
raped me last night.
But i can't find
the memory in your mind.
To be honest, is not
clear for me either.
We should do it again
and try to understand.
You owe me that.
I was sentenced
to hibernation
for trying to protect
people like you.
No one is like me.
I'll go along with that.
What do you read
in my mind now?
Ok, i'll buy you a drink.
I'd love a bottle of
bordeaux. Is been ages.
Never heard of it.
...space and time...
...who are you?
...i think you like me...
...what are you
doing to me?
...i'm confused...
...can't remember anything...
...i'm a guinea pig...
...a human woman...
...you can call me jill...
...you're expecting
something from me...
...the answer is no...
is cold!
Is my leg.
I should have warned you.
Is a bit icy.
Not much blood circulation.
It would be a shame to let
a few degrees of temp...
...temperature
interrupt us.
Sorry, jill. Sorry.
Calm down, jill.
Calm down.
Something in the air's
changed since last time.
Don't you find?
Central park,
intrusion zone. Risk of death.
Central park, intrusion zone.
Risk of death.
John, i'm scared.
John, please...
i'm here, jill.
Is too dangerous
to cross over now.
Is not ready yet.
Neither are you.
Tomorrow, i hope.
Intrusion is a gateway
which will close behind me
and disappear with me.
It will reappear
somewhere else.
Other passers will come,
but you'll be the last
creature to use it.
John?
Yes?
I've met someone.
Good. Your life as
an earth dweller has begun.
Meeting humans,
feeling desire,
being in love.
One of the most
beautiful feelings
you'll experience here.
But i love you.
You first.
Iove is a very
different thing here.
What should i do?
Cry.
Whenever you feel
the need, just cry.
Where is she?
Where the fuck is she?
I told you...
she went for a walk.
You're right to
want to hurt me.
Even if i don't feel
a thing, hit me!
Harder!
You piece of shit!
Your objectives are shit!
Your filthy rapist
god ambitions are shit!
You're full of shit!
Coming from you, remarks
like that don't mean much.
You're damaging
that girl.
You're damaging jill.
You're destroying
something beautiful.
You don't destroy
what you love.
You shouldn't have
let her go.
She'll be back.
We have to make love
to her again.
It isn't over yet.
Oh, right...
the impregnation.
I nearly forgot
the minor detail.
What is this
obsession of yours?
An obsession about
how little time i have.
I really feel for you.
I'm dr. Elma turner.
I'm looking for
one of my patients.
Few people come here
looking to be cured.
Jill told me she was
a regular here.
You must know her.
White skin, blue hair.
I don't know any humans.
Personally, that is.
Jill isn't really human.
How much do you know?
You must be john.
You must be
elma turner.
I've something important
to tell her.
I'm pleased to meet you.
I need to see her.
That won't be necessary.
Everything is happening
on a different level now.
What do you mean?
Where is she?
At least tell me she's ok.
White skin?
Blue hair?
Interesting.
Let me introduce myself.
Inspector froebe.
You powdered your face
for the occasion?
Is none of your
business, lily.
My friend...
my dear, dear friend.
Kyle, is been a long time.
Too long... i know.
I still feel
the tension inside you.
The hubris.
Like five years ago,
when you sneaked out
without my permission
and took a bite
out of inspector froebe.
Remember?
Do you need
something from me, kyle?
Yes.
Have a taste of this.
Find him...
and finish the rest!
Still alive?
I know
this split personality
is not an easy thing
to deal with.
But i'm the one responsible
until proven otherwise.
Are you alone?
So he's gone?
The rapist who lives
inside your body
and forces me to have
sexual intercourse?
I think so,
but i'm not sure.
Above all...
i don't know.
That wasn't a very
smart thing to do.
The blue of my tears
stains human skin for good.
I feel blue...
for you.
I should have shot you
the first time we met.
There's still time.
Thank you, nikopol.
Thank you.
Shhh, she's asleep.
Young women like her
are rare.
Extremely rare.
There are only a few
in the universe.
No one knows why
they appear.
They don't even understand
their own power.
What power?
The greatest
power of all...
the power to procreate
with gods.
I got it. I'm just
the empty shell.
The vehicle delivering
the divine seeds.
Thas not going to alter
my opinion of you, horus.
I don't want to go.
Jonas can represent me.
Don't
let me down, kyle.
Don't prove to me
what i already know you are.
This is your fault.
You're the one who
dragged me into this.
Have you just figured that out?
Sure, kyle. You're the pawn,
and i'm the player.
But i've got news for you,
you little bitch!
You're a pawn, too.
Eugenics' pawn!
And who is eugenics? Huh?
You're right on that one,
but i'm a superior pawn.
Your superior pawn.
You understand?
Now get up
off your fat ass,
move into your
xxxl clothes,
say a prayer that your dayak
finds your nikopol
and go and negotiate
with ancient egypt!
Move it!
Could you forget me
if you had to?
What sort of
question is that?
Seriously.
If you had no choice,
could you forget me?
No.
Well... i might
forget you...
against my will...
without wanting to.
What are you
trying to say?
Things will happen to me
that are out of my control.
I've already been through that.
But i can control the future
for two... or more.
You're pretty sure of
yourself, aren't you?
How can you tell?
When you say "two,"
who do you mean?
Are you thinking
about you and me,
or you and him?
The one inside your body?
The rapist?
I'm thinking about us.
Wouldn't he be jealous?
Right now, for instance,
i know he's here.
I can sense him.
The rapist says he will
never do that again.
When i kiss you,
am i kissing him, too?
When he raped me,
did you enjoy it?
Jill!
John!
What are you
waiting for, inspector?
An old friend of mine.
Suspecs vehicle
crossed 49th and madison.
All patrols on alert.
Repeat, all patrols
on alert.
We're wasting
precious time, inspector.
Jill's in danger.
Careful.
The engine's highly tuned.
Just like you.
Report!
I'm on their tail.
Who's shooting?
Hold your fire.
Who's mortal in here?
Who can die
a violent death?
Well, i feel
somewhat mortal.
I don't think so...
mister?
Mister... horus.
Jill!
Where's the pyramid?
Where's the senator?
Is here. Come on.
Is here, jill.
Is time.
We're in the heart
of intrusion.
The dead center.
John!
Your time has come.
This red pill is the final
stage of your treatment.
It will make you
human for good.
A human woman.
Will i forget
everything? Everyone?
You'll write yourself
a new story.
Swallow it.
The void, jill.
The void.
Forget me.
Forget...
john!
Horus! Where
the fuck are you?
I need you.
I need you now.
You must be anubis.
I admire you so...
you fucking bastard!
You'll never speak
that jackal's name again!
Be patient, brothers,
i'm coming.
Nikopol!
You have been much more
than a body to me.
I wish i could do more
to thank you...
but you're running out
of time, i know.
I sincerely hope your life
as a human is a happy one.
You will no longer feel
the burden of your leg.
You'll see,
there will always be
a little bit of me
left inside you.
I don't know
how i should take that.
I will never be
far from you, jill.
Ever again.
Ever.
Do i know you?
I'm back. Were you
bored without me?
The sentence is binding.
I'm ready to face it.
Without delay.
Now, then...
nikopol, serial number n-7.
You are under arrest
for attempted escape.
You have one year left
on your sentence.
Sorry, but he was
in there, wasn't he?
Who?
The killer. You must
know a lot about him.
Yeah, he's a friend.
How does he kill?
I'd give a lot to know
the answer to that.
Jill!
New york officials
announced the opening
of central park's intrusion
to public access...
today's temperature
is unusually low...
take a break!
New orbital holidays!
Forget archaic politics... say
'yes' to liang's new projects!
For you who can still read,
there's "spirit of nikopol,"
by the man from the past,
nikopol himself...
thanks for your book.
I couldn't put it down.
What about... her?
Her?
Her.
Do you like paris?
Oh! I'm sorry.
He's so cheeky.
Did he hurt you?
No, not at all.
He's just fine.
Couldn't be better.
I'm terribly sorry.
My name is jill.
I'm... nikopol.
Do you like this planet?
It has its charm.
"Mais tout cela ne vaut pas
le poison qui decoule
de tes veux,
de tes yeux verts.
Lacs ou mon ame tremble
et se voit a I'envers.
Mes songes vienned en foule
pour se desalterer
a ces gouffres amers."
But all that
is not worth
the prodigy of
your saliva, jill,
that bites my soul
and dizzies it
and swirls it down
remorselessly,
rolling it, fainting,
to the underworld.
