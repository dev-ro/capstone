It seems a bit brown.
You can see it clearly here.
It doesn't matter.
It's your father's money.
It's not,is it?
Do you have any change? No
Me neither.
We can go somewhere else anyway.
Thank you
Jerk!
The money is artifcial.
Didn't you look carefully?
Such things are common in Paris
You didn't refuse yesterday?
You've been fooled.
Spend it.
Thank you.
Take this.
Thanks.
No
How about this?
It's ... This one?
It's the change that someone gave me.
I can't give it back to you.
Don't make decision by yourself.
You are a bad guy that spends artifcial money.
Ask him? Ask the one spends artifcial money.
It's me.
Give you the request form, here it is.
There's a written pledge.
Sorry for bothering you.
Let's go.
How stupid I am.
It's not over yet.
Maybe you make it wrong.
Don't bother me.
What's written here?
What's up?
I wanna talk to you for a moment.
I used the artifcial money.
You may not get sued, if you pay for it.
The photo shop and the workers there
And the boss have the duty to clarify for you.
The case begins
I've never seen him come to the shop
What about anywhere else?
Never.
Anything more?
No
The reason we take this case is
that the accuser has nobbled thousands of franc
Yvon Targe
The case is canceled,and you don't have to pay the legal cost.
don't get sued again by good people from now on
Now thank for our mercy
What are you worry about?
You didn't keep your words
Get cheated by two kids,I can't remain in silence
Lucien is so great!
Go buy the clothes that you like
What if you get caught in the reason of perjury?
Don't worry.
That's true.
If you tell them clearly,you can still have your job.
I don't wanna give in.
The price is not the same as yesterday
How come? It's true.
The boss is not here today.
Nothing we can do,really.
Is that so? No
Admit it, it's not the first time you did this.
But everyone does the same thing.
Trust me,I won't sue you
And I don't wanna fire you.
Your demission is not the real purpose.
What a nice person.
If I had the money
Look.
It's the key for the cashbox
Same type as the one in the shop.
Where's the president?
The president is not here,I'm the administrator,what can I do for you?
It's about a boy.
He should be here.
Put "Noces de Cana" away for a moment.
Let's get back to the artifcial money
If someone among you did something bad,
It's not forgivable for him to lie
Don't lie,just confess,it'll be okay.
Christian?
I didn't
Geoffroy?
I don't know
Norbert?
Me?
Father will not know this thing
The president will tell father,sure he will
Don't deny it.
I see.
Any questions? So far.
We won't tell anybody.
Sorry for bring you so much trouble.
No no.
Please take it.
Don't go out of this room
What a fool!
They say they can't lend us money
100 meters ahead, there's a turning there
and wait for the chance
That's all?   That's all.
Why you don't tell me?
He's wounded,should be in the hospital now.
You don't understand anything?
He's in jail.
It seems that can't meet him before the court
The Court.

This thing is hard to be talked about,but it have to.
Dear Yvon

Everyone will afraid of death.
They set up shop at the other side.
The bussiness is not good after being stolen
Do you know that prisoner?
That one use artifcial money.
Him?
Same group.
Just forswore themselves
They deserve that
If those rich people can hand out something to the poor
It's a good thing.
But people may say something bad about us.
You did something bad to me about the artifcial money
I did the same thing to Yvon
There's a stamp in the envelop
Can't believe it.
It's returned by the addressee
Elise Targe,17 Rugetaipe Street,Paris
Want a cigarette?
Why look at me?
Don't speak.
The letters are always returned back.
It's true.
I'm just worried.
A woman can't live alone.
Can't live without love.
They are all similar.
Maybe she haves an affair with someone
Why do you say this?
Is he excited?
No,he's calm
He's more dangerous than anybody.
What are you doing with that spoon?
Nothing
You wanna kill someone?
Tell me.

How are you,Yvon?
You'd better know that you are seized.
Belive in god.
You will not bleed when grabing money.
Because it is something like freeshare.
So do it.
It's clear in prejudication.
You are Always interested in colorful clothes.
Will you admit deceit and theft?
In this specail time, in the new concept.
You can only answer questions.
If there isn't a law, we will not inplead you.
Even you are guilty, you can live a new life.
I think these words have bad influence to the judge.
Even if you are judged.
You still have your native rights.
If you realize your existence and the cruelty of the society.
You can advise others by using your own experience.
Be obedient.
It doesn't matter others.
It is a happy world now.
I can do anything as long as the world is happy.
I want to be happy now.
Money is the god which wo can see.
Look out.
I have some problems with my knees.
This is the sequelae of the drug. It need streating immediately.
Is Yvon here?
I'm here. Who are you?
It may look like this originally. Lucien looks in.
I will not go.
Excape.
Follow me and it will be OK.
You can wscape through the keeping-room.
But there are many troubles when you get out.
Swear to god taht I will do anything.
It will be better to kill you than to escape together.
We will not kill anyone.
We will not be looked down on.
Follow me.
Why do you treat me like this?
I'm Lucien.
I destoryed my room.
It's time to go.
You will be punished.
I was in prison the whole life.
I don't care any more.
The rule of revenge is the same to everyone.
It will be unpardonable even when you kill an insect.
You may take your revenge without battle.
Your relatives far away are waiting for you.
Weather relatives or friends.
I haven't a wife.
It will be with reassurance now.
Take good care of your health and get out early.
No need.
Don't care me.
You should put all things away.
I will take good care of myself.
Revolt more directly.
How impenetrable!
