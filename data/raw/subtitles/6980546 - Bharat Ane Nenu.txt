you saw a monarch in me.
But what i see, is a parent's love towards his child.
Why are you being so harsh towards the public?
Did you consult anyone before taking this decision,
or were you just being impulsive?
"With all my conscience"
" I, Bharat.. "
"... give you my word"
"that, I'll be responsible..."
"As a Leader, of the people, for the people, by the people"
"This is me..."
"This is me..."
"This is me..."
"This is me!"
Finally a man has arrived,
who's not just a political leader,
but a true 'Leader'
Hi....
Sir...
when you're in power, you watch our back
and when it's our turn,
We'll watch yours.Thats our unspoken agreement.
I swear on god, soon enough I'll make each one
of you a man, by making you stand on your word.
If the doubts of everyone in the house are cleared,
with your permission, Iâ€™ll take a leave, Madam Speaker.
"This is me..."
"This is me!"
