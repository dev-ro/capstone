You don't really love me.
Of course I do.
How could you even say that?
No, you don't.
You don't love me!
Jules.
Jules, wake up.
Is she okay?
You have to wake up!
You've got to wake up, Jules. He's coming!
So... Annie...
not the best way
to start your first day, is it?
Come on, let's go, bitch.
What are you gonna do?
Come on.
What are you gonna do?
- What you gonna do? Come on.
- Ooh.
Come on, bitch, let's go.
Let's go. What are you gonna do?
- What are you gonna do?
- Enough. Stop it.
You're lucky.
Now...
despite that, you have a clean slate here.
It's also quite clear
that you're a good student.
Do you like school, Annie?
Sure.
We have a small, close community here,
and I do what I can to carry that over
into these halls.
I take a personal interest
in the welfare of our students.
It's okay.
All right... you can go.
Your mother's on her way to pick you up.
- Sorry.
- Oh, no. Thank you, it's fine.
This new girl comes in here
thinking that she's about to...
She was so scared when she saw me.
She's so lucky the teacher came up fast.
{\an8}If I see this girl one more time...
{\an8}She's so stupid.
{\an8}This girl probably went home,
cried to her mom.
{\an8}You know that's what happened.
# When we're under the covers #
# I know you are mine #
# I hope that we're always lovers #
# We can try #
# We are running #
# Cool and running #
# Cool and running #
Are you kidding me? It's your first day.
I didn't do anything. I was the new kid.
Did you meet anybody nice?
Stop.
Come on, anybody?
Maybe.
Maybe?
Oh, maybe.
Who?
Okay, all right.
Well, nobody must be cute,
because I know that smile.
Hi.
I'm Annie.
I'm sorry about yesterday. I...
- I'm...
- I'm Jules.
I'm Annie.
- I know.
- Oh, yeah.
You're new here, right?
Mm-hm. Yeah, I just moved here.
So...
you're a dancer?
Yeah.
What about you?
No, I don't, like, dance or anything.
I don't know, I might like
to learn someday, though. Maybe.
I can teach you if you want.
Really?
Okay, yeah, that would be cool.
Um...
How about Wednesday?
Sure, yeah, Wednesday works.
Cool.
I'll see you later, Annie.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
- Then you end like that.
- Like that?
Yeah. So, try it from the beginning. Back.
Square. Your body is a square.
- Okay. Hold my hand.
- Okay.
- These guys are like all over her body.
- Like that?
Yeah.
She's like, "I'm a slave."
Okay, no, no, no, show me...
Show me your best worst dance move.
I don't have bad dance moves.
- I have a ton of them.
- I could teach you how to waltz.
- I can't do it. I'm sorry.
- You're good.
- I suck at this.
- It's okay.
I'm not really a dancer.
Yeah, but you're cute.
Want one?
I'll take a drag.
Come on.
What are you doing tomorrow night?
I don't know.
Nothing.
Oh, shit.
Hey, boys.
Hey, girls.
# It's all right #
# Ah #
# All right #
You coming with?
No, I gotta get home.
That's cool.
# Wee #
# All right #
- I'll call you tomorrow, okay?
- Okay, I'm free after...
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, pal.
Come help me get the rest of the stuff
out of the truck.
Yeah.
Where were you last night?
Huh?
- Where were you last night?
- Where was I? Where were you?
Home.
- Doing what?
- TV.
- Anything good?
- Nope.
Thomas?
Thomas, come here.
Thomas.
Hey, Dad?
Yeah.
Think I could start coming to work
with you?
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, I'm really starting
to get into pools.
Oh, yeah?
Franco and Son, I like the sound of that.
What do you think, Mom?
I think you should set your goals
a little bit higher. That's all.
What are you trying to say?
- Here, let me help you.
- Thank you.
How lovely you look.
What?
What did I do now?
# My telephone don't ring anymore #
I can't drink any more.
I feel sick.
I have to undo my top button.
So, what are your dreams, Annie?
Sometimes, they're really weird.
- Like last night, I...
- No.
No, like, what are your dreams in life?
You know? What do you wanna do?
Where do you wanna go?
Oh.
Um...
- If you have to think, they can't be...
- Okay, I don't know. What are yours?
New York.
I wanna join a dance company...
hot dogs, pretzels,
Central Park at night...
bright lights, big city.
All that glamorous shit, you know?
I mean, I know it sounds
kind of cheesy, but...
it's been the only thing
I've ever wanted, really.
That sounds rad.
# Before the storm #
You see these waitresses here?
Every single one of them
went to our high school.
They're stuck here...
forever.
In New York...
you can be whoever you wanna be.
Every day is a new adventure.
I need that.
I need that to feel alive.
Here, it's like you know exactly
what's gonna happen tomorrow
and the day after that,
and the day after that. Nothing.
If I stay here I'm gonna end up 45...
pouring shots...
teaching...
ballet to some... adult beginners' class.
The horror.
You should come with me.
- To New York?
- Yeah.
- Right.
- You could study there.
Crazy.
Can I get you girls anything else?
- Uh, just the check.
- Please.
So...
you two go to Rochelle High?
Yeah.
Mm. I remember
my senior year there.
Mikey Lopez. Mm.
I told you.
You still think I'm crazy?
Well... you know what I mean.
I have to pee.
What? No, no, no.
No.
# For way too long #
# But when the winds come weaker #
Order's up.
# Take down your sails, boys #
# Time to... #
# Don't let me down #
Sweetie?
You okay?
# Your ship keeps rockin' #
Hello?
Hey!
Oh, my God.
What are those?
Care for a mint?
Well, you know,
I paid for the bill, you dummy.
Are you serious?
Come back with those mints!
It almost looks pretty from here.
Yeah, it is what it is.
So...
when did you first realize
that you like girls?
When I was in third grade...
there was this... kid named Leridon
who I was in love with.
- Leridon?
- Mm-hm.
And his sister's name... I swear to God.
Was Leridonna.
- No.
- Yeah.
- Are you making this up?
- No, I couldn't make that shit up.
All right.
Welcome to my humble abode.
What are you looking at?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Oh, my God, I'm so hungry.
Does the baby want some ice cream?
Yeah.
Is this your mom?
Yup.
You want vanilla or strawberry?
- Both.
- Jeez.
She's beautiful.
Mm-hm.
Her pretty little ass went and left
when I was 12.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's fine.
Apparently, she couldn't deal
with being a parent.
My dad really checked out when she left.
But he doesn't hassle me,
so, I can't really complain.
How about you?
My mom's weird.
She wants to be my best friend.
I wish my mom wanted to be my best friend.
Let's go. Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee. Let's go.
Left, left, left.
Right, right, right, cross.
- Hey, I got some new jokes.
- Hit me.
How do you get a nun pregnant?
- How do you get a nun pregnant?
- You dress her up as an altar boy.
- Ha, ha!
- I'm still bigger than you.
What do you think of that?
That was a pretty good shot, though.
That wasn't bad.
- Do you understand that joke?
- No, I don't. Can you explain it to me?
No, I'm not gonna explain it to you.
Definitely... Oh.
- Oh, no.
- Excuse me, I'm just getting beat up
- by our son here.
- Do I need to call 911 again?
Oh, no. Dad's just getting old.
- Hey, kids.
- Hi.
Sweet outfit, Lynn.
Thanks, Jules.
- Oh, this is the famous Jules.
- Yes.
Hi, I'm Annie's dad.
Nice to meet you.
Hey.
Nick, why don't you tell the ladies
a joke?
No, thanks. I'll pass.
Hi.
You smell good.
You girls hungry?
Ooh. Hold still.
Ow.
- I'm gonna go really hard, okay?
- Okay.
It's gonna...
Okay.
Almost done.
- You're doing really good.
- Okay.
Just finish it.
- Almost done. Almost done. Almost done.
- Are we done yet?
Okay.
- You're finished?
- I'm finished.
Oh, thank God.
Whoa!
Pretty good, huh?
It looks really good.
- Let's take a photo.
- Okay.
Cycle sisters.
- It looks so good.
- Yeah, it does. Thanks.
It's gonna stop bleeding soon.
What's the furthest
that you've ever gone with a boy?
That came out of nowhere.
Um...
- Martin Schonez, he...
- What?
- Just this kid. He...
- What did Martin Schonez do to you?
You know, he...
fingered me.
Did you like it?
No, it was awful. He, like...
He didn't know what he was doing.
It kind of hurt.
Yeah, Alex is pretty terrible, too.
He thinks he's so good.
He thinks he's like God's gift to women.
- He sucks. He doesn't clip his nails.
- Ew!
- I know.
- Oh, that's so gross.
And...
when he actually starts doing it,
it's like he thinks he's a miner,
and he's like going in the caverns
to dig for gold.
Oh, yeah, there it is. There it is.
Eureka.
Oh, man. I'm sorry.
It's okay.
It's my fault for letting him think that.
I don't know.
I guess he serves a purpose, right?
Hey, Annie.
Uh, do you have any laundry
you want me to do?
Um, yeah, Jules just spilled soda
on her shirt.
- Sorry.
- Oh. No worries. Here.
Okay. Well, it's getting late,
girls, so...
why don't, um, you get her a shirt
and some paper towels
and clean up that mess
before it stains the carpet, okay?
Okay. All right. Okay.
- Okay. Good night, Lynn.
- Good night. Good night, girls.
Have fun.
Oh, my God.
Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh. You ready? See this?
- Mm-hm. Yep.
Bam. Bam. Bam.
Draw four. Nobody is safe
because I'm dropping bombs all night.
- You know... I gave birth to you.
- Mm-mm.
- Only four.
- No. Give him. Give him two more.
That's six.
Hey, can I sleep over at Jules' tonight?
- What are you guys gonna do?
- Yeah.
I don't know.
Just hang out, watch a movie, do nothing.
Yeah, right.
You know all she's gonna do is get stoned
and make out with random dudes.
Oh. Mm...
- That's not how you make out.
- You would know, though, wouldn't you?
- Shut up.
- Oh, okay. Enough.
Um, why don't you have her come over here?
You can have the TV.
- What? Seriously?
- Oh, yeah. Seriously.
Mom, he's never gonna leave us alone.
Yeah.
Damn right.
Damn right. You know why?
- Because I'm dropping bombs.
- Ah, mm-mm.
- What?
- Not this time, homey.
- Wow, that's great.
- So, can I?
Um...
Yes.
# I wanna show you what you mean to me #
# When I'm with you
There's nowhere else I'd rather be #
# Well, no one can faze me #
Ugh.
# Baby, you amaze me #
# I'll be waiting #
Hey, Jules.
# Come on and get me #
Hey.
# Ooh #
# Ah #
Hey, Jules. Hey, Jules. Hey, Jules.
Annie, your friend is here!
Oh.
Um, hey, Scott, what's up?
Don't worry about it. She's in the car.
Hey.
I thought you said just Jules.
I didn't know they were
gonna be here, Dad. I swear.
What did I tell you?
I'm always right.
Okay.
I won't tell your mom.
But be safe.
- Call me if you need anything.
- Okay, I will.
# I hear the babies cryin' #
- Come on.
- Whoo!
# Sun... Sun is always shinin' #
# Now the mothers are a-sighin' #
# I hear the babies cryin' #
# See all these bullets flyin' #
# I... I know that they are tryin' #
# I... I feel that they are lyin' #
# I... I hear the babies cryin' #
So, this summer,
we're all gonna pitch in
and buy a shitty van,
fucking drive down to South America,
set it on fire and then fly back.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm great.
Oh. Um...
Just a little... there.
Mm. Time-out.
Okay. That's nice.
Mine.
All right.
- Do we need to take the baby home?
- No. No, I'm having fun.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.
You like Scott?
I like him right now.
- I like him tonight.
- That's my girl.
- You're gonna get in trouble.
- I hope so.
Okay, I have an idea.
Okay.
Are you down?
Yeah.
- Yes, I'm so down.
- You trust me?
Mm-hm.
# Green, yellow and white #
# In my mind #
# Walk slowly in time #
# I want much #
# Where have they gone away #
# Early today #
# Don't treat me that way #
# I ain't your baby #
I'm wondering
if we should drive or fly there.
I mean, it would be a nice road trip,
don't you think?
We're not gonna need a car in New York.
We can just set it on fire
when we get there.
What?
- It's just something that... Never mind.
- Okay, I think that's last call for you.
Well, either way,
we're gonna need a ton of money.
- I've got a lot of money saved.
- From what?
Is that you?
What is this?
After-school job.
How does it work?
Okay, wait.
Here, put this on.
- What is this for?
- Just put it on.
Wait, are we live on this?
Uh-huh.
All I do is wiggle around,
and these sad horny dudes give me money.
- It's that simple.
- You're kidding.
I know. It's stupid, right?
Most of the time I just lay around.
One time, I took a nap. I made 120 bucks.
Yeah, but don't you care about your face
being all over the Internet?
That's what the masks are for, duh.
Look.
- What is that?
- That's how much money we just made.
Twenty bucks? We just made 20 bucks?
This is so cool.
You wanna try it?
No, I mean...
Okay, I can see you doing it,
but I don't know if it's my style.
I don't even do anything that bad, though.
I don't ever take off my clothes.
It's just a tease.
I've been doing it since last summer.
You know what? I'm way too drunk
to handle this right now.
Why are you so cute?
Wait, wait, what about the computer?
Don't worry about it. It's just us.
# And that certain stare
That smile gets me every time #
# So what am I #
# If not resigned
To make the same mistakes #
# To watch them play out
The same way each night #
# So, I fall for the same face
Every time #
# I fall for those old familiar lines #
# I fall for the same face every time #
# I fall for the same face every time #
# Oh #
# I fall for the same face every time #
I think I love you.
Annie.
Annie.
Annie, come on.
You've been sleeping all day.
You've got chores to do. Get up.
- Enough already. Let's go.
- Fuck, leave me alone.
Excuse me?
No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey.
Look at me. Look at me.
You do not talk to me like that.
Do you understand?
Okay, Annie, you know what?
I don't really know what's gotten
into you lately. I don't, but...
I'm over it.
Enough already, okay?
Enough with the lazing around
and the doing nothing.
It is your turn to do the dishes,
and I've got to get dinner started.
So, get off your ass and hop to it, kid.
Okay, but I don't feel well.
- What's wrong?
- I think I just need more sleep.
You don't have a fever, Annie.
You're fine.
- What are you...? What are you doing?
- Get up, Sleeping Beauty.
- This is so stupid.
- Get up!
Gotta love PayPal.
But we're gonna need a lot more than that
if we want to be riding the subway
anytime soon.
# Do all my brothers trust me #
# I will sit right here #
For expenses.
Oh. Oh, yeah, totally.
# I'll drink whiskey and honey #
What's going on
in that little head of yours?
Can we go on the site?
Oh, my God, look at you.
Well, I just want to check it out.
Make some money.
Okay.
# I will drink you up #
# Leave nothing but your bones #
# I will take you home #
# Leave nothing but your bones #
Here's a... Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
You gotta leave something
to the imagination.
Oh, got it.
Okay.
So, now you just wait.
- We do dancer.
- A wave.
- Hi, boys.
- Oh, my God, look at how excited they are.
Wow.
Some of these people are so gross.
Holy shit.
- Wait, is that actually...?
- Yeah, that dude just sent us 100 bucks.
We didn't even do anything.
# Whiskey and honey #
# Whiskey and honey #
# Whiskey and honey #
"Serious...
about what?"
- Oh, you got a fan.
- Ew.
"Thanks!"
# Whiskey and honey #
# Whiskey and honey #
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, right.
That's not gonna happen. "Ha, ha."
# Whiskey and honey #
# Whiskey and honey #
Oh, really?
Ew. All right.
I don't wanna hear about that.
- Hey.
- I'm done.
You're no fun.
Frank?
Uh, I couldn't sleep.
I'm just checking work e-mails.
I'll come back to bed in a minute.
Are you sure
that you're comfortable with this?
'Cause we do not have to do this
if you're not into it.
Yeah, no, it... Okay, it's fine, but maybe
we can just stick with the main-page stuff
and not do the private chat.
Okay, yeah, totally, totally.
I want this to be fun. I don't want this
to be weird or creepy or anything.
- No, I was having fun.
- You were?
- Mm-hm.
- You sure?
Mm-hm.
- You wanna try it again? Main room?
- Okay.
Main room.

Where were you last night?
I told you I was gonna be at Annie's.
Yeah, but I called like...
- Don't be mad.
- We gotta get to class.
- I have to go, babe.
- Sorry.
Hello, Alex.
There's a whole lot of skin there
for a boy so tardy.
- Button it up.
- I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Be the change you wanna see in the world.
Annie?
I'm coming in.
Yeah, ready for bed? You're tired.
Here you go.
Yeah, okay.
Um...
I think maybe you're spending
a little bit too much time with Jules.
What is that supposed to mean?
Exactly what I said.
It's not gonna kill you
to spend time apart.
She's my best friend.
She's my only friend in this shitty town
that I didn't want to move to.
I know. Okay, I know. I'm sorry.
Good night.
# In my mind, in the fields I lay #
# I thought of you for a million days #
# I can't explain the things I do #
# In this life I live for you #
# Things I feel push you away #
# But if you like, I can change #
# Hey #
We believe she had to do that.
I hope the two of you understand
how serious of a situation this is.
There's all sorts of questions
that need to be answered here.
What's going on?
Murder him!
What if my parents find out?
I don't think this is what your parents
had in mind when they moved you here.
Annie, do you wanna tell me something?
If anyone was exploited
possibly sexually in any way...
we'll have to get the authorities
involved.
Just fuck it.
Okay, screw everyone at this school.
We just have to get the hell out of here.
I don't even care what it takes anymore.
I'll do anything. We have to leave.
Can we go now?
You can go. But come Monday,
we will be continuing this conversation.
Bye, Mr. Damone.
With your parents.
What a fucking joke.
This is not a joke, Jules.
He totally knows.
Annie, calm down.
He doesn't have anything on us.
If he did,
our parents would've been in the room.
Yeah, well, they will be on Monday.
Annie, we're going to be out of here.
It's fine. Just relax.
You trust me, right?
- I don't know, Jules.
- What?
- I mean...
- What do you mean you don't know?
We don't have enough money.
How are we getting out?
My parents are gonna make me
change schools.
Calm down, calm down.
We're going to be fine.
God, it's Alex.
That cocksucker.
- Hey!
- Jules.
What are you doing?
Hey, asshole.
Whoa, the fuck?
I thought you liked being on camera.
Fuck you, Alex.
Don't forget that last year
you were wearing flares
and getting your ass kicked
by Cody Foster.
You're pathetic.
You're worthless.
Oh, shit.
Shut up, eyebrows.
Annie doesn't like you either.
I am so happy that you showed up.
I don't know how much longer I could've
kept faking it with this idiot.
This is as good as it gets for you guys.
It sucks.
Ten years from now, you're gonna be fat,
balding, in debt,
doing the same boring shit
with the same boring people
in the same boring-ass fucking town.
So, really remember this moment, boys...
revel in it...
'cause this is you at your peak.
- I thought that we had more.
- Not enough. This isn't even close.
Well, what are we gonna do?
I mean, we can't leave.
We step it up.
We go on the Internet
and we find someone local.
Jules, you're not gonna go fuck
some random guy?
"I'll do whatever it takes." Isn't that
what you just said in the bathroom?
That's not fair.
You're out of your mind.
If you have any other ideas,
now would be the time to voice them.
Posted.
Jules, you're fucking crazy.
There's no way you're doing that.
Now we just sit back and wait.
Hey, this guy might work.
He's kind of cute.
You wanna see?
Come on.
Just come look.
What do you think?
- Hmm?
- No.
He's harmless.
If anything goes wrong at all,
I'll get us both pepper spray.
If you have any weird feelings,
we're out of there,
no questions asked. I promise.
Come on, I'm only asking you
this one time.
Never again, I promise you.
One team, one dream.
Okay, but if the slightest thing
weirds me out...
We're out of there, I swear.
Okay, fine, then I'll do it.
All right, but first
I have to make a stop home.
So, how's it going?
Good.
Everything's fine?
Yeah.
School?
Good.
You getting caught up on your work yet?
Mm-hm.
Annie, look at me.
What?
What? What did I do now?
Okay, well, first of all,
let's discuss this attitude of yours.
What attitude? I'm just sitting here
trying to eat my dinner.
You know what, take it down a notch.
Do not take that tone with me.
You are still 17 years old, okay?
I'm almost 18.
Yeah, and I'm still your mother,
for crying out loud.
Listen, I don't know why you always
treat me like I'm out to hurt you
when all I wanna do is help you.
Okay, this act that you've got going on,
I'm over it.
This tortured teenage bullshit is a bore.
Yeah, that's right, it's bullshit, Annie.
Come on, really?
Really, you've got it that rough, huh?
Me and your father, we're monsters to you?
No.
Then what the hell is going on?
I don't get it. You're constantly out.
You're sneaking in all hours of the night.
You think I don't know about it?
You're really, really
testing my trust right now.
I'm just hanging out with Jules,
that's all.
It's not like we're doing anything.
I swear.
Okay, look, I know...
you might find this very difficult
to believe, but it was not that long ago
when I was your age.
Okay?
And I remember what it was like.
I do.
And I had you when I was very young.
What are you saying, that I was, like,
a mistake or something?
No, Annie, you were a blessing, okay?
But I'm not going to lie to you.
It was...
hard. It was really fucking hard, okay?
And you need to remember one thing,
that you and I,
we are playing on the same team, okay?
I am with you.
I am always with you.
I am your mother.
I will always have your back 100 percent.
I am never against you, okay?
I just want shit to be a little bit
easier for you. That's all.
Okay, I'm sorry.
School called.
They want us, uh... to go in on Monday.
I haven't told your father yet.
You know anything about it?
No.
Okay, Annie, I'm giving you a chance here.
What? I don't know anything.
I don't.
I don't know anything about Monday.
- You finished?
- Yeah.
Take it to the sink.
Sweetie?
You okay?
So, everything's awesome?
I don't...
I don't know what to do.
I have no fucking idea what to do.
Baby, she's a teenage girl.
She's got a wall up and it's just...
I have no idea.
Honey, you were a teenage girl once, too.
I know... except my mother
was a total bitch.
Yeah, that's what you thought at the time.
Really? You're calling me
a bitch right now?
- Never.
- Is that what you're doing?
Never.
Annie?
Annie?
Nick? Nick, are you in my room?
You're not allowed in my room.
- Hi. I, um...
- What are you doing in here?
Mom sent you, huh?
I know you said to try and be cool
with Mom and I am.
I'm honestly trying but it's like she just
gets so intense and bitchy sometimes.
I don't know how to make her happy.
I mean, how do you handle her?
What?
Dad?
What?
Remember when I won you that blue dog?
I love you, honey.
I love you, too.
Good night.
Good night.
I wanna be Clementine.
- That's cute.
- Okay.
Kitty and Clementine. Okay.
Look at how big these homes are.
You know, at least they're close together,
so, if we scream somebody will hear us.
Oh, my God, stop, Annie.
No, but seriously.
That's a good thing.
- All right, 17609?
- Uh-huh.
Okay, this is...
- This is it?
- Yeah.
Fuck, should I park the car on the street?
I don't know if I can do this.
Hey.
It's just sex.
That's all it is. It means nothing, okay?
Okay.
Everybody who you ever sleep with is gonna
be a stranger at some point, right?
Just follow my lead, okay?
This night is gonna change
the rest of our lives.
Right?
I'm so nervous.
Fuck, so am I.
Should we go? Should we go back?
Maybe we should go to my house
and we can figure something else out.
No, we can do this.
Liquid courage?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Give me another.
Ah.
Ah. Okay.
Are you ready, Clementine?
I'm ready, Kitty.
You sure this is the right place?
It better be.
Frank?
- Kitty.
- Uh-huh.
This is my best friend, Clementine.
Pleasure to meet you, ladies.
Can we come in?
Oh, yeah, sure. Of course. I'm sorry.
It's been a really long day.
Please, come in.
Ooh.
Something smells really good.
Well, I'm making us a nice little dinner.
I just opened some champagne.
Would you like some?
- Yeah.
- We'd love some.
Okay.
- Oh, my God.
- I know.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Last but not least.
Toast.
To tonight.
- Oh, my gosh.
- Is everything okay?
Yeah, Annie just tried to kill me.
Annie?
That's Clementine's middle name.
I like to call her that sometime.
Names, names, names,
first names, last names.
What's in a name, right, Frank?
- PS, this food looks amazing.
- Oh, my God, young, successful, handsome.
You can cook.
Is there anything you don't do?
Mm.
I can't believe some cougar
hasn't gotten you to walk her
down the aisle yet. Oh, my God.
Oh, I almost forgot.
A good friend of mine once told me
that seafood is best served with...
God, we hit the jackpot.
He's harmless and he's fucking loaded.
Yeah.
It's been so long since I've entertained.
All right.
What...?
What about a toast?
To our host.
- To Frank.
- To Frank.
I couldn't help but notice
that you have a Jacuzzi outside.
It's the best way to relax
after a, uh, rough day at the office.
Don't you think it would be a good idea
if the three of us took a dip
after dinner?
You want some?
Yeah, give me some.
Mm-mm. Hands down.
Open up.
Clementine?
I would love some more.
Frankie.
Frankie, baby.
Yeah.
Clementine and I have been talking.
We really like you.
Yeah? I really like you guys, too.
- You do?
- Yeah.
It's so sexy to see a man who's able
to make his dreams come true.
I mean, this place is fucking epic.
It's aces.
Thank you.
But, you know,
we've got dreams, too, baby.
Uh-huh.
You know?
- Uh-huh.
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Yes.
And we need the help of a really nice,
generous man like you.
Yeah.
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.
I really think 5000 bucks could go a long
way into helping our dreams come true.
Five thousand?
Don't act like you don't have it.
Yeah, but, no, that...
That's not the figure
that we discussed before.
I mean, I didn't make all my money
by being a pushover.
Anything you want.
Anything.
Everything you want.
All night long, Frank.
I don't know about you,
but I would say that's a bargain.
Don't you think?
Oh, that's a steal.
Last offer, Frank.
Take it or leave it.
Closer.
- Get in.
- Okay, like this?
Get closer to his face.
Huh?
Hey, Frank...
we gotta get going.
- What time is it?
- It's still pretty early.
You should go back to sleep.
We can let ourselves out. Don't worry.
Ta-ta.
It's been fun.
That wasn't so bad, was it?
It could've been worse.
What was the photo for?
Spending money.
You'll see.
# Quick, before your nose begins to drip #
# Allow the heart to take another sip #
# Quick, before my mind begins to slip #
# Deny the urge to make another grip #
# Love is not allowed to those who run #
# Nor is it the power of the one #
# Put your cares and hopes away #
# And save them for a rainy day #
# Until the world is swallowed
By the sun #
# Quick, before my mind begins to fade #
# Ask the moon to chase the day away #
# Quick, before my eyes begin to phase #
# Allow your heart
To chase the dark away #
# Love is not allowed to those... #
Hello?
Anybody home?
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Oh, God.
Ugh, fuck.
- She doesn't wanna talk to you.
- Let me talk to my wife.
- Give me the phone, now.
- When she wants to talk, she will.
- Give me the phone.
- All right, well, I'm coming over there.
You swore this would never happen again.
Don't ever call us again.
Stay the fuck away from me.
This is over.
Fuck.
Last night was fun.
But we still have some big dreams
to achieve.
Ten thousand dollars should get us there.
Let's do lunch at Victoria's.
In the meantime,
we won't show anybody at our high school
the photos we took last night.
Hugs and kisses, Kitty and Clementine.
So, we're meeting him at the café.
What if he doesn't show?
- We make do with what we have.
- Okay.
I'll pick you up in the morning,
like always.
- I love you.
- I love you.
Annie, Jules is outside!
Morning.
Don't forget we have that meeting today.
See you in a little bit.
I love you, Mom.
I love you, too, Annie.
Maybe we should wait.
Wait for what?
New York.
After everything that we've done,
after everything that we've been through?
Hello?
I'm scared, Jules.
I mean, we've taken this way too far.
I don't... Blackmail, the webcamming?
I just left my family.
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.
I mean, do we even know what we're doing?
I knew it.
Knew what?
You don't really love me.
Of course I do.
How could you say that?
No, you don't.
You don't love me!
Jules!
Jules!
Somebody help us.
You're okay, come on.
No, please, don't.
Come on, come on, come on.
Here, here.
Here. Here.
You have to take this. I'm gonna get help.
- No, no, no. Please don't go.
- Okay.
It's okay. I'm gonna be right back.
I'm not gonna leave you.
Hey, just stay here.
Hey!
Goddamn.
No.
No!
No!
Let her go.
I'll fucking do it. I swear to God.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
You've already taken everything from me.
Jules.
It's okay.
You're okay.
Somebody help us! We're in here!
Just hold on, okay?
- One down.
- We're gonna fix you up.
Put your hands where I can see them.
Put your hands where I can see them.
I have you, okay?
I'm never gonna let you go.
I'm gonna take care of you, protect you.
One team...
One dream.
