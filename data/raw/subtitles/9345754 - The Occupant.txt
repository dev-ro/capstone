NETFLIX PRESENTS
THE LIFE YOU DESERVE
FRIGISMART APPLIANCES
Wow.
"The life you deserve."
A classic.
Thank you.
So many memories. I can see myself
eating a PB&J sandwich in front of the TV.
What year is that from? '94?
Ninety-eight.
Damn! How old was I?
Fifteen, right? You?
Twelve.
We're getting old, Natalia.
"The life you deserve."
- All you?
- All me, yes.
The client didn't like it,
so we had to push for it.
We had to fight to get it tested
because no one did that at the time.
Sure, it was very good for its time.
And for now.
Yes.
And for now, of course.
Some elements are timeless.
Do you have any recent work?
Well, I have...
- this Telefónica campaign.
- Movistar.
No, Telefónica. I also have...
Cordoniu's holiday campaign
from last year.
BOLD STATEMENTS
HAPPY 2018
Nope.
This doesn't ring a bell.
No? It did really well.
Did you do this at Tilson?
Yes.
Yes, that was the last one before...
Well, I'd been there a long time
and wanted a change of scenery...
I don't know.
I wanted to try a smaller agency.
Not that small.
No, well...
No, not at all.
I meant to say younger
and more open to taking risks.
That's what I was looking for.
And you left Tilson...?
A year ago.
Let's see...
Javier, you have quite a résumé.
I'd say you're a legend.
Totally.
And...
the vacancy here...
is beneath you.
- It doesn't have to be.
- It is.
It's entry level,
for people that are just starting out.
Right, but aren't we all starting out
in some way?
I don't understand.
I'm not above it. I'll roll up my sleeves
with the youngsters or anyone...
Look, Javier, you say
you want a young place that takes risks.
But I don't see any risks in this.
I see...
a bottle of cava
with a Santa hat.
I'm sorry.
I'll see you out.
Could you validate my parking, please?
Yes, of course.
- For which client?
- Excuse me?
- Which client do you work for?
- No client.
I came in for an interview.
I'm sorry,
we only validate parking for clients.
OK, but they asked me to come in.
I left the car downstairs,
and no one told me.
Right.
They should've told you.
But that's company policy. I'm sorry.
Can't you make an exception?
I have to enter a code.
Each client has one,
and it needs to be registered.
- I'm sorry.
- So you've said.
Excuse me?
"I'm sorry." That's the third time
you've said it.
Could you just validate
my parking, please?
I'm sorry.
Iker?
Is there a problem?
The gentleman asked me
to validate his parking.
But I told him
I need a client code for that.
Validate it.
Use my code.
Thank you.
What's on your mind?
Tell me. What is it?
My interview today.
- How did it go?
- Well.
Yeah, really well.
I got a good feeling.
They'll let me know in a few weeks.
Javier...
- Ask me.
- What?
- What's on my mind.
- Marga...
Come on.
"What's on your mind?"
- El Carmel.
- No.
We own it and are renting it
to some Asians for next to nothing.
No way.
How long can we go on like this?
The rent here sucks us dry every month.
It's our home.
They're four walls, Javier.
That's it.
I'd rather sell the car.
That too.
Fuck, Marga. And how will I get
to my interviews? By bike?
In the Fiat.
Or the metro, and you can tell them
your car is in the shop.
What?
Do you want me to lie?
- Javier...
- What?
He's completely clueless.
Hi.
You spoke to Mom, didn't you?
Well, you have nothing
to worry about, OK?
The move is temporary.
Yeah, she already said that.
Just for a few months,
until things settle down.
And don't worry about school either
because we paid tuition
for the rest of the year.
So, you can still go.
There's no need.
For what?
If I have to switch schools,
I should go to the nearest public one.
Sure, but I just said it's paid for.
Why should I stay?
They already laugh at me.
What will they do when they hear
I live in El Carmel?
They laugh at you?
What for?
What do you think?
I don't know, Dani. You tell me.
Dad...
- Why do they laugh at you?
- Can't you see?
I don't see a thing, Dani.
Sure.
I'm going to be late.
Araceli.
It's pouring out.
Would you like a ride to the metro?
Well...
thanks.
Araceli.
I wanted to tell you...
Well, I guess
my wife told you we're moving.
Yes, she did.
And times are really tight.
No, Mr. Muñoz.
I'm sorry, Araceli.
Please, don't do this to me.
If things are better
in a few months then, maybe...
And Dani?
I really love that boy...
Dani is going to be fine.
- Now, if you don't mind...
- It breaks my heart.
We're really upset too.
Araceli, come on.
I'm sorry.
Forgive me.
What I meant to say is...
Yes?
The keys.
Could you give me back
the keys to the apartment?
Araceli!
That's another box of glasses.
You can put it there.
Careful with that in the elevator.
Javier Muñoz?
- Hello. Excuse me, where's the manager?
- She's in the back.
Thank you.
Javier Muñoz?
Hello. Javier Muñoz?
Come with me, please.
Watching your ass get fatter
and your hair turn gray,
is that how you'll change things?
No!
Or will you get up, grab life by the balls
and give 'em a good squeeze?
Is that how you'll make a change?
Yes!
You need to stop apologizing.
You need to stop asking for permission!
Javier?
Yes.
And that's when I said,
"Jacinto, I'm not a salesman."
No.
I'm a dreamer.
Because advertising is about dreams
and showing people...
Let's not kid ourselves.
The dream isn't that original.
We have to show them...
that there's more to life, right?
More than what they're willing
to settle for.
Listen up, Lucas.
They don't teach you this in your master's.
I'm taking notes.
Well, so... I brought my portfolio.
There's no need.
I don't need to see your portfolio,
Javier. We all know your work.
BMW, Frigismart...
- I loved the cava with the little hat.
- Right.
So my only question is,
"When can you start?"
Well, I don't know... Now?
Fantastic.
Oh, sorry. I have a conference call
with London now.
You and Lucas can finalize the details.
Great.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
- So, welcome.
- Thank you very much.
Here's the contract.
- If you want to take a quick look.
- Yes, certainly.
Thanks.
Excuse me...
- Lucas?
- Yes.
Lucas, what is this?
The trial period. Three months.
Unpaid?
Correct.
Hold on. But this is an...
internship contract.
Exactly. That was in the ad.
Could you ask Darío to come back?
I can't. He's on that call.
We'll see. Darío and I go way back.
- He won't put me through a trial period.
- Well, he was surprised...
to see your name.
He was surprised you came.
And?
And he said you'd be a bargain.
No...
- Hi.
- What's up?
I've been on my feet all day.
I think I got a blister.
I'm going to need comfy shoes, otherwise...
Oh, bleach.
- And Dani?
- In his room.
I left you pasta in the microwave.
BASEMENT
Calm down!
Calm down!
Calm down. There's no one here.
RHYTHMIC GYMNASTICS
What's up?
Nothing. Homework.
How was school?
Fine.
No uniform is better, right?
It's more comfortable, more casual.
Dani, we haven't done
anything together in a while.
- We watched Star Wars.
- Yeah, but that was ages ago.
Why don't we... I'm going for a run
to clear my head, get some air.
- Why don't you come with me?
- Now?
Yeah, now. We have time before dinner.
I don't know. I'm doing algebra.
Mens sana in corpore sano, right?
Didn't they teach you that in Latin?
Jesus, Dad. Latin's from your time.
What a jerk!
I'll get changed and show you
what your old man's made of.
See you at the door in five.
Very good.
Come on, bud.
Through your nose.
Inhale through your nose
and exhale through your mouth.
No. You're inhaling
through your mouth, Dani.
You'll get more tired. Use your nose.
- OK.
- Come on. Good work.
That's how it's done. Come on.
You're breathing through your mouth again.
- Sorry.
- No! Don't apologize.
Don't talk. Come on.
In through your nose
and out through your mouth!
No! No stopping!
- Then you won't reach the top! Come on!
- I can't.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Come on, Dani!
- I can't!
- Almost there. Come on!
Dani, no. Don't stop, keep going. Dani!
What happened?
- Nothing.
- What do you mean "nothing"?
Nothing. We went running,
and he got a bit tired.
Did you vomit?
What did you do?
- Me?
- Yeah.
It wasn't Dad's fault.
We ran up the hill.
The one back there?
- I thought he could do it, Marga.
- Why?
- "Why" what?
- Why did he go up the hill?
- He was teaching me.
- It's exercise. It's healthy.
- Is this healthy?
- Do you know what isn't? Obesity.
- Javier.
- Nor being laughed at.
- Enough!
- You didn't know.
- Javier.
- Did you know?
Of course I knew. He's my son, OK?
I already spoke to the principal
and his tutor.
What about me?
Why didn't you talk to me, Marga?
Everyone knows he gets laughed at but me.
Do you know why I didn't tell you?
This is why.
Your son has trouble at school,
and your solution is to make him puke.
- I just want what's best.
- "Best"?
Yeah, what's best for you and Dani.
I don't want my son to be an outcast
or you to smell of bleach.
It's a job. I'm making it work.
That's not "making it work," Marga.
That's giving up.
Why don't you take a walk?
Yes?
Hi, I'm calling about the ad.
What ad?
The used car.
Is it still available?
- I asked if it's still available.
- No.
No... I'm sorry, I sold it already.
Already?
Can I see it or make you an offer?
No, it's been sold.
Good night.
Introducing our new flavors...
There are risk-takers...
rebels...
dreamers, people that...
...the all new 48-hour, ultra smooth...

something new every day.
...time for success...
...fully covered.
Let's do this together.
It's about peace of mind for you

- Good evening. How's everything?
- Great.
- Head in. They're waiting.
- OK. Great.
I'll be there in a bit.
Welcome!
- No, I'm not...
- Come on in.
We don't bite.
Amparo.
Javier.
First time?
Yes.
Come in.
Sit anywhere you like.
Hi. Good evening.
- Hi.
- Hey.
How are you?
Was it a good week?
1 MONTH
Hello. Welcome.
Well, let's get started.
We have a new face today.
It's his first time here,
let's give him a warm welcome.
You can speak if you want, no pressure.
Share. Listen.
You can do anything, except interrupt.
Who wants to start?
Me.
Well, it's been...
a fucked-up week.
Toni and I split up.
And I know you'll say, "It's for the best.
Fuck that guy.
All he did was cause problems."
Yes, he snorted lines all day.
But now that he's gone...
I'm the one who wants a line.
This...
is the most important thing
I have in the world. Seriously.
But I feel I'll be giving it back soon.
Yeah, I'm doing well.
Sometimes I'll go past a bar
and I think, "Fuck. I could just go in,
take a carajillo and hit the slots.
When...
When he kisses me,
I know...
he's just trying...
to smell my breath.
Going out is tough.
Seeing friends is tough.
It's hard to go out,
always surrounded by beers and drinks.
It's my birthday today, fuck!
Thirty-six already.
But, hey. No cava, all right?
No cava. We'll toast with sparkling water.
Anyone else?
Well, if no one has anything to add,
let's call it a day...
I'm sorry.
Hello.
My name is...
Javier.
It's my first time here.
I don't really know
how this works.
But I wanted to...
Well, I wanted to thank you
for sharing your stories
and for helping me realize...
that I'm not alone.
That's what I need.
Not to be alone, face this alone.
I tried to quit,
not once or twice,
I think it must have been...
five times.
And that's five times
I've gone back out to find the guy
who I can score from.
I went back to it
out of weakness, stupidity,
because I have nothing else.
I already lost my wife...
I lost my daughter.
I've hurt them...
emotionally...
and not emotionally...
if you know what I mean.
But I want to change.
I want to believe
that I'm a better person,
that I can be better than that.
Because this isn't me.
Thank you.
...you're right.
Congratulations.
- How nice. Thanks.
- And welcome.
Welcome.
- Thanks.
- The first step's always the hardest.
Right? Well, and the second,
third, fourth, fifth,
sixth...
There are 12.
Steps.
Oh, right. Excuse me.
Hi.
I just wanted to...
offer some encouragement.
I get you.
I went through the same thing.
Relapses...
are tough.
I won't say how many times
I've fallen and got back up.
But look at me now.
One year.
So keep going, all right?
Thank you.
Good night.
Excuse me.
Would you mind...
Well, I have some concerns,
lots of questions.
Could we get a coffee?
It's late, I'm sorry.
No, let's go.
There's a coffee shop next door.
- Javier.
- Tomás.
Pleasure.
The trick is to see them coming.
Knowing what situations tempt you,
what throws you off-kilter.
To know your weaknesses.
And you can't defend yourself
against all of them. Careful.
But knowing they're there
is half the battle.
Believe me, I'm fully aware of them.
But do you own them or blame others?
Good question.
The most important.
And yours? How do you know what they are?
Practice.
Sometimes at work you...
What do you do?
I'm Vice President of Altamira Transport.
Wow!
Yeah, "wow."
But there's pressure, conflicts.
Sometimes you don't feel valued.
- At home too.
- At home?
Yeah, well, like anyone.
I work long hours and Lara...
Lara's my wife.
Sometimes she thinks
I'm not around enough.
As if you could clone yourself.
- That I'm an absent father.
- Does she say that?
No exactly, but she thinks.
And it hurts.
And that's... one of your weaknesses?
I'm just saying because it sounds
as if you're blaming her or...
See?
It's easy to fall into that trap,
even for me.
You saw it.
MARGA
- I'm sorry.
- Answer if you have to.
No. It's nothing.
No!
- It's on me.
- Sure. By all means.
- This has been really useful.
- Don't mention it, man.
I wanted to ask you...
I'm sorry. We just met,
and I keep asking for stuff...
Don't worry. What is it?
I just started this recovery thing...
and I wanted a sponsor.
I was wondering if you...
I really don't know.
I've never been a sponsor,
it's a huge responsibility. I don't...
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to put you on the spot.
I just moved to Barcelona,
and I don't know anyone here, so...
OK. We can try.
A month or two, and we'll see how it goes.
- Great. Thanks.
- OK.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
Yes?
Hi, good evening.
I'm calling about the car ad.
It's been sold.
Javier?
- Where were you?
- My class went over.
And the teacher invited
a few of us out for a drink.
You could have called.
My phone died.
I need to charge it.
Who did the teacher invite?
The nerds?
His favorites, yeah.
Kiss-ass.
So? Does he have any work?
He's got something.
He wants help on a project.
It seems interesting.
Yeah? That's awesome, right?
Yeah, I believe things are looking up.

- Are you coming?

SPORTS COMPLEX
After years of traveling...
We're bringing right to your door...
Are you ready to discover them?
What can I get you?
A cognac before you catch a cold?
What do you want?
It's been...
a while since I spoke, right?
Six months, at least.
No.
I'm fine.
I don't have to give it back.
But I realized how easy
it would be to lose it.
A few days ago, my wife and I fought.
Nothing serious.
I don't know.
I don't know, it was enough
for me to hear that voice again.
You know the one, right?
- Yes.
- Absolutely.
But I'm almost grateful.
For the fight, I mean,
because it made me realize
that sobriety is far more fragile
than I thought.
We have to be aware
and keep our guard way up.
It's good to remember that sometimes.
Thank you, Tomás. Anyone else?
Javier. Go ahead.
Well, I just wanted to...
thank everyone...
because last week,
which was my first time,
I was really lost, groping around
with nothing to hold onto.
But not anymore.
You really helped me.
Seriously.
Now I have...
a goal, a project
that I'm going to put all my energy into.
Yes, because you realize,
at least in my case,
I realized my real problem was apathy.
You get comfortable,
stop giving your best,
and, one day, they say you're old,
you cost too much,
and you find yourself out on your ear.
But not anymore.
I'm done watching people enjoy things
they don't know how to appreciate
and don't deserve.
So, from now on, I'm going to grab life,
my life, by the horns
without asking for permission
or apologizing.
Thank you.
- Great news about the project, right?
- Yeah.
- What is it?
- Bye.
It's too soon to tell.
So mum's the word?
- It's top secret, so...
- What can I get you?
- A black coffee and...
- One with milk, please.
- You got it.
- Thanks.
How was your week?
Pretty busy?
Nah.
Another fight?
A misunderstanding.
Like I said the other day,
you need to be careful, know yourself...
Yeah.
- What happened?
- It was stupid. I screwed up.
I was late picking up Mónica.
- Mónica?
- My daughter.
Right, of course.
It's always like that. One little screw up
and you're a negligent father, right?
Do you have a picture of the little one?
Yeah.
Look.
They're beautiful.
- You're really lucky.
- Yeah, I know.
And you? Any pictures?
No.
No.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
No, it's all right.
Thanks.
Here's to your secret project.
- Can you toast with coffee?
- Why not?
Cheers.
I have to go. The market's closing,
and there's nothing sadder
than a divorcé's fridge.
Why don't you come over for dinner?
No...
I'd hate to impose.
And I doubt your wife's expecting guests.
Another day, tomorrow, the day after.
Come on, man.
OK.
Yes?
Tomás? Javier.
Hold on. I'll come get you.
Some punk poured glue into the intercom,
and the repair guy hasn't come yet.
OK.
Mr. Muñoz?
Mr. Muñoz!
Hey, Damián!
- You're working late.
- Yup, until who knows when.
Ever since they fired the Ecuadorian,
I haven't stopped.
Did they fire Gustavo?
- Yeah, budget cuts.
- Right.
It's just me,
working for two on one salary.
And you? What are you doing here?
Nothing, I came... to pick up some mail.
Some people haven't got
our new address yet.
They're for Marga. It's our anniversary.
And since the apartment is
on the way to the restaurant...
Right.
Well, good to see you again.
You too, Damián.
Say hi to your wife for me.
Will do, thanks!
And the kid.
Take care.
- I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
- Nah! What's up?
Come in.
I hope you're hungry. I bought
some awesome steaks, really thick.
- You're not a vegetarian, are you?
- No.
You're in luck,
the neighbor's dog is quiet today.
He's usually unbearable.
Come in, man.
I'll give you a tour.
Not bad, right?
Stunning.
Right?
Lara and I had been looking for a while
and couldn't decide.
At first, I thought the rent was too high,
but when the realtor opened the blinds,
I thought, "This is it.
Tomás, this is your home."
I thought I heard voices.
- You must be Lara.
- Javier, right?
- Yes, it's a pleasure.
- Likewise.
I would've brought a bottle of wine, but...
I've heard a lot about you too.
You're Mónica, right?
Your dad told me
you're a real Almudena Cid.
Margarita Mamun. When she grows up,
Mónica wants to be like Margarita Mamun.
Well, don't worry about it, Mónica.
They often say I'm behind the times.
...can't even imagine the frustration.
Six months, busting our asses at the firm,
trying to find a way for Amina
to bring her kids to Spain.
And now the judge says
she might not even be able to stay.
It's really hard.
Exhausting.
Yes, but it's fulfilling too, right?
Helping others, I mean.
- Of course. It's worth it.
- Where'd you get that idea?
What do you mean?
Well, I'm saying pro bono work
is just that. Pro bono.
Sure, but money isn't everything, Tomás.
- I didn't mean that, but...
- But?
I don't know.
It's not as if you have to choose
money or fulfillment. I mean...
look where you live.
Just leave it there. I'll load it.
No, come on. Let me help.
Do you and your wife have kids?
My wife?
Oh... this.
No, well...
we're divorced.
I put it on, I don't know,
without thinking. It must be...
habit or...
that it's tough to accept.
We have a little girl, too.
Well, not so little now. She must be 14.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought it up.
Don't worry. You couldn't have known.
No, don't worry.
Her mother doesn't want me to see her.
And I don't blame her.
She put up with enough.
More than anyone should have to.
And well...
I had to choose.
It was them or the gin.
And I chose wrong.
So, when I see a woman like you
standing by her husband, the truth is...
I admire you.
I admire your strength.
And I envy his good fortune.
- Come on!
- Mónica.
Wait.
A flower for a flower.
What do you say, sweetie?
- Thank you.
- What a cutie.
Let's go.
What did you think of the old tenant?
What tenant?
Of your apartment.
Didn't he come by yesterday for his mail?
I think you're mistaken.
I'm losing my mind.
You're on the fifth floor, apartment two.
- Yes.
- He was on the fourth.
- Don't mind me.
- Don't worry.
Shall we, love?
- Good morning.
- Bye.
- Yes?
- Tomás?
Javier.
- Are you OK?
- No, I'm not OK.
I fucked up, Tomás.
Where are you?
Shit!
Javier!
Javier!
Javier, are you OK?
I'm in one piece.
Give me that.
- Give it to me.
- Tomás!
Tomás, please.
Shit.
What did you do, Javier?
I'm sorry, I just wanted one drink.
- We never want one. We want 1,000.
- Right.
You need to see it...
You need to see it as an allergy.
Look at me.
Allergic to peanuts my whole life.
Just one and I'm dead.
It's the same with one drink, one line.
Just one will ruin us.
Do you understand?
Yes, but last night
was really hard for me,
seeing everything you have.
A family, success...
Success.
Fuck, Tomás,
you're VP of the second largest
transport company in the country.
Who do you think is the owner?
Lara's father.
No matter how hard I work,
I'll always be the son-in-law.
Well-connected.
That's my success.
I slave away at a job I don't like,
so Lara doesn't have to admit
that her dad supports us.
I didn't know.
Did you call the tow company?
No, my phone died after I called you.
- Can I borrow yours?
- Of course.
Thanks.
Oh, shit.

COMPOSE
FROM: TOMASANDRADE_TRANSPORT
TO: JAVIER
Do you know the number?
I had to look it up, sorry.
- Just one thing.
- What is it?
Lara.
I wouldn't want her to think...
Could you not mention any of this to her?
Yeah, of course.
- I don't want to get you in trouble.
- Not at all.
Thanks.
And the car?
I sold it.
The money will get here in a few days.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Someone else for the ad.
I'll tell him it's too late. Yes?
Javier?
Yes. Who's this?
It's Damián.
Damián... I don't know any...
The gardener.
One moment.
It's the buyer.
Something's wrong with the car.
Yeah, I'm sorry. Damián, hi.
How did you get this number?
It's on the tenant list. The old one.
Right.
And do you need something?
We should meet.
Who? You and I?
Tomorrow morning.
At ten.
I don't know if I'll have time.
Yes.
Yeah, you'll have time.
- I'm sorry, Damián. I said...
- Those flowers were pretty.
Really pretty.
I don't know why they already dumped them.
They're still good.
So, ten o'clock?
Where?
Who was at the meeting?
Lucía, Manolo, the marketing team.
Did you go out?
No, we had sandwiches
in the conference room.
Lara.
I'm not doing this again, Tomás.
I don't have the strength...
It's not what you think, Lara.
I've put up with enough shit
not to recognize the smell of gin.
Am I right?
Yes.
But it's not mine.
- Come on, Tomás!
- It's not mine. It's Javier's.
- Javier?
- He came over for dinner. Javier.
He called me this afternoon, a total mess.
I had to go get him and literally
pull the bottle out of his hands.
And he called you?
The guy is alone.
Why did you lie to me?
He asked me. He's embarrassed.
He doesn't want you...
You lied because a stranger asked you to?
He's not a strang...
It's complicated, Lara.
Sure.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't ever lie to me again, Tomás.
- Come here.
- No.
Do you like the zoo, Javier?
Well, I don't know.
I love it.
I love the tiger cage.
I stand here...
Son of a bitch.
What are you looking at?
What?
Growl at me.
He'd tear me apart anywhere else.
But not here.
He can growl at me. He can roar at me.
But he can't do shit.
How much do you want?
"How much?"
Yeah. How much?
I can get 2,000 or 3,000 maybe.
What the fuck is that?
You'll go into the apartment today.
They must have a hamper,
full of dirty laundry.
Look for panties, dirty ones.
Not from a drawer.
Put them in the bag. Close it tight.
That'll keep the smell.
Lara's?
No.
I'll think about it.
That one. That's the tiger's stare.
Think it over quickly.
Or I'll call Tomás this afternoon
and tell him who you are.
Yes, I'm sorry.
No, I left my phone at home.
But I'm done.
OK.
OK. I'll make a quick call
and head over.
See you soon.
Hi. This is Javier. Leave a message.
Hi, Javier. This is Lara, Tomás' wife.
Do you think we could meet today?
It will be quick.
But we should talk.
Please call me when you can. Thanks.
I have nothing against you.
I think you're a good guy, a good person.
That's why
I don't want to ask you this, but...
I think it would be best
if you stopped seeing Tomás.
Tomás is doing well.
He's been well for a while,
but we had a really rough patch.
We can't risk going there again.
That wouldn't be fair to me.
It wouldn't be fair to Mónica.
You get it, right?
I'm not sure.
Are you saying I'm bad for Tomás?
No, I didn't say that...
Yes, you did. It's OK, but you did.
I just don't get why.
- "Why?"
- Yes.
Javier, Tomás told me about last night.
- He told you?
- Yes.
I'm his wife.
You can ask him to lie, but at the end...
Hold on.
I'm a little confused.
I asked him what?
You called him.
You asked him for help,
because you'd been drinking.
What?
What?
I didn't call him.
He called me. He wrote me.
He told me
he needed help, that he fucked up
and lost control.
No.
No.
- Lara.
- No way.
You don't have to believe me.
In fact, I'd rather not be the one
telling you this.
But if it's for Mónica's sake...
you should know the truth.
JAVIER, I FUCKED UP. COME GET ME, PLEASE.
DON'T TELL LARA.
Has he ever lied to you?
I'm sorry.
TOMÁS ANDRADE - INCOMING CALL
REJECT - ANSWER
WOLF PROTECT
Class was canceled.
I'll take out the trash.
See you later.
Take me
to the Sant Adrià chimneys, please.
...where you'll experience
something new every day.
Are you ready to rediscover...
I'm sorry, I just remembered something.
Could you take me downtown,
Montealegre Street?
Sure.
Wow!
Who do we have here?
- Javier, right?
- Yes.
The prodigal son returns home.
We thought something had happened to you.
Trouble at home, that's all.
You know this is a new quarter, right?
Yes.
Yes...
And you're not on the list.
Did you sign up?
Yes, I think so.
Well, I don't see your name.
You need to go to the Admissions.
I'm talking to you.
Sure. I'll go after class.
No, not after class. Now.
- Now?
- Yes. Now, as opposed to later.
OK.
Are you deaf or what?
No.
Go on! What are you waiting for?
I'm going.
Go!
I waited for you last night.
I'm sorry. I had to take a detour.
Here.
- Where are you going?
- Home.
I need a shower.
Oh, you thought this was over.
Come on, close the door.
Close the door.
Make sure it has a clean view.
The girl's bed.
- The rest of the room, if possible.
- No.
- No?
- No.
I would never hurt Mónica.
Me neither. I just want to watch.
You're sick.
Definitely.
Do you think I don't know?
Twenty-four hours.
Or I won't call Tomás,
I'll call the police.
- Hi.
- Hello.
I'm Javier Muñoz.
Tomás Andrade wants to see me.
What are you doing here?
- Tomás, what's wrong?
- What did you tell Lara?
- Lara?
- Yes. What did you tell Lara?
The truth. She called me,
wanted to talk, asked me what...
And you lied to her.
- What?
- You said that I called you,
a wreck, asking for help.
Yes, of course.
You son of a bitch.
Tomás, I was worried.
- Why?
- About you.
No, why are you lying?
- Tomás, you need to stop.
- No, you need to stop!
Look at me! You do!
We're worried about you, Tomás.
Do you seriously not remember?
You wrote me, ask...
That's a lie.
- You asked me to come...
- No!
- You were a mess.
- No!
And your car?
- My car?
- Where is it?
I sold it.
Mr. Andrade, stop!
- Stop! Calm down!
- Your car!
Let me go!
Javier?
Javier?
What happened?
It wasn't Tomás, was it?
Is Mónica home?
No, she's at school.
I'd not want her to see me like this.
I'm afraid he's losing control.
He's paranoid, jealous.
Jealous?
Yeah, I don't know.
Maybe he thinks you and I are...
- I don't know.
- You and I?
- It's absurd, but if he relapsed, he...
- He had been drinking?
- Has he ever been violent before?
- Never.
Are you sure?
It was an accident.
He lost control of the car
when he was drunk.
He quit the next day.
Right.
When are you expecting him?
I'm not. We had a fight yesterday.
He went to a hotel. He'll probably...
call or come here.
Lara, I hope you don't mind,
but I bought you this.
What's that?
A precaution.
- No.
- Just in case. No one says you'll have...
I don't want this in the house.
It's safe and legal. It's not a gun.
Even if it's for Mónica's sake.
So she's safe.
Call me if you need anything. OK?
- Yeah.
- Day or night.
Thank you.
What's going on, Javier?
I spoke to the bank again,
the car money hasn't arrived.
God! What did they do to you?
Javier?
Where are you going, Javier?
Javier!
Javier!
Javier, open up!
Javier, open up!
Javier, open the door right now!
What is going on?
I may be back in a few days
for the rest. I don't know.
- Dani.
- No.
Dani.
So, is that it?
Would you prefer fights...
yelling, explanations you won't believe?
Well, yes.
HOSTEL
BATHROOM IN EACH ROOM
You've reached Lara Blasco.
If this is an urgent matter,
call Agustina at 660-130-410.
If not, leave a message.
Hey, it's Javier.
I was calling
because I noticed yesterday
that the gymnastics championship
is being held in Barcelona.
And I remembered that a few years back
we did a campaign with Valentina.
Valentina Costa, the Spanish champion.
And I thought that maybe
Mónica would like to meet her.
I bet the distraction would do her good.
And you too, probably.
So...
let me know if you agree,
and I'll make some calls. Bye.
- Hi!
- Hi! How are you?
Great.
You must be Mónica.
Yeah.
Thank you for seeing us
before the competition.
You're welcome.
We're going to rehearse.
Do you want to watch?
- OK.
- Yeah?
Cheese!
- Done?
- Yes.
Great.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
I'm sorry.
...tomorrow, in fact.
Up, one.
A little gift for you.
...three, four. Long.
Long in front.
SO YOU KNOW THEY'RE DOING OK
I got her.
Up we go.
Lara!
- Tomás, go away!
- Lara, open up!
Mommy, what's happening?
We want you to leave.
Do you? I'll go.
When you tell me
what the fuck is going on with Javier!
- You're scaring her.
- I'm protecting her.
- From what?
- From that son of a bitch!
- Don't you see?
- He did nothing.
- Are you blind?
- No, Tomás!
Look at what I see.
This? You and Javier did this together.
- I'll be right there.
- Sweetie!
No. Everything is fine.
- I don't want her to see you like this.
- Like what?
You're not well, Tomás.
- She's my daughter.
- You'll see her when you're well!
You love it, all of this.
- You've waited months for me to relapse.
- That's not true.
You always thought I was weak,
and now you're right.
And you love that more than anything!
- Tomás!
- Tomás fucked up. It was inevitable!
I'm going to call the police!
What will you tell them?
This is my fucking house!
This is my fucking furniture!
My fuck...
Tomás?
Tomás.
Tomás.
Open it.
Open your mouth, sweetheart.
Shit!
- Javier.
- Lara. I'm in the cab.
I think I saw Tomás' car. Are you OK?
Javier, I don't know what to do.
I think I killed him! He's not breathing!
- Who?
- Tomás.
I've killed him, Javier.
He's not moving.
- Lara, don't move.
- He's not breathing!
I'm close. I'll get the cab to turn around
and I'll be there in a minute.
- I'm going as fast as possible. OK?
- He's not breathing.
Lara.
Lara.
I think I killed him.
He's dead.
- He's not moving.
- Come.
- Come on.
- Where?
- To Mónica's room.
- No.
Yes. Make sure she doesn't come out.
She can't see him.
- What are you going to do?
- Call the police.
- Not the police.
- Yes, we have to call them.
I promise everything will be fine.
It was an accident. OK?
911. How can I help you?
Yes, good evening.
I'm calling because there was an accident.
Is anyone hurt?
I don't know. My friend is...
He's on the floor unconscious.
Is your friend breathing?
I don't know.
I'm not sure. I don't think so.
What's the address, please?
Seventy-eight Bosch i Gimpera,
Apartment two, fifth floor.
OK. We'll send an ambulance.
Please hurry.
You don't deserve them.
Mónica!
Good morning.
- Javier, Darío is in your office.
- How is he?
He asked for a herbal tea.
Take a guess.
- Hey.
- Good morning.
They're almost here. Are you ready?
What's wrong, Darío? Nervous?
What do you think?
Altamira Transport.
That's three million in sales.
We can't just impress them...
Darío, I played tennis
with my father-in-law yesterday.
And?
I let him win.
So, there's nothing to worry about. OK?
Hold on.
- Yes?
- Your wife is here.
Lara?
No. Marga.
Send her to the conference room.
I'll be right there.
Is everything alright?
Yes, it's my ex.
Go greet them.
I'll be there in five minutes.
- OK, but don't take too long.
- I won't.
Marga.
You won't see me in your office.
- What do you want?
- Are you hiding something?
What do you want?
I think you are.
At first, I didn't understand
all the comings and goings,
even when I found what you threw out.
They were like puzzle pieces
that wouldn't fit together.
Then the news came out.
A business executive died.
In our building.
I recognized the photo.
It was our kitchen.
They said it was an accident
during a fight.
An allergic reaction to pepper spray.
PEANUT EXTRACT
Then the pieces...
fell into place.
Someone could've tampered with the spray.
Someone who knew
the victim had an allergy.
I'm not dumb enough to bring it, Javier.
It's somewhere safe.
I've been thinking about this for months,
asking myself,
"How would this affect Dani?"
But I finally made a decision.
I'm going to show it to the police.
I'll tell them everything.
You're finished.
The apartment in El Carmel,
it will seem like a palace
compared to the cell you'll end up in.
Do it.
- What?
- Do it. Call them, give them the bottle.
Tell them everything.
Fine.
Do you know what I'll do?
The account I opened for Dani's school
and to support him...
will be the first to go.
I'll spend it on a lawyer.
The best and most expensive I can find.
Your apartment will be next.
Well, my apartment.
It's in my name.
I'll sell it to pay
for those very expensive lawyers.
You'll end up on the street.
So tell the police. Go on.
You wouldn't dare.
Are you sure?
Now, excuse me,
I have a meeting with clients.
