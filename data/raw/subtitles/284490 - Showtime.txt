Being a police officer is not
What you see on television
l never had to choose between
a red Wire and a blue wire
Never seen a police car flip over
Causing a chain reaction
Then a car burst into flames
Never had to jump from one Roof top to another
l spend my time investigating crimes
Tracking down leads typing up
reports And sitting in court
lt`s difficult tedious work and you`re
Not gonna get rich doing it
But l`ve been on the job for 28 years
And l wouldn`t have it any other way
l am a detective that`s what l do
You break the law in my city
l`ll do everything in my power to hunt
You down and put you behind bars
l`m not gonna say l`ll succeed Every time
But l`ll try my best to make sure
That if you commit the crime
You`ll do the time
Any other questions?

No, he`s wasting our time.
ls that a new shirt? lt looks good.

going to get me out of here, man?
Well , not me, brother. lt`s the TV show.

Frame for the Justice Channel .
Let me tell you about the show.
What we do is fight like brothers like yourself.
Put a light on your situation.
People outside will see what
our brothers have to say.
And what happens hopefully
a grand root campaign got started
and to get you all out of here.
Do you know what l`m saying?
Like Mandela.
You know what l`m saying. Similar to Mandela.
You ain`t that noble, l read your file,
l meant you ain`t no Nielson.
You are Lerun. Hey, man,

Trey, it`s Mitch. l`m going talk to you through this.
That`s what l thought.
Say what?
When you speak, you don`t have to talk too
loud. Because we are going to pick everything.
Should my lawyer be here for
something like this, man?
Oh, no. That`s the wrong thing.
That`s the wrong thing to do.
Let me explain something to you.
By now, research has shown that
people don`t want to hear from lawyers.
They don`t want to hear from lawyers. They
don`t want to hear people talking for others.
They want to hear you talking
straight from your mouth.
They ain`t going to get you out of prison.
Do you understand that?
There ain`t cops here, there ain`t lawyers here.
Just you and me talking here.
That`s it, brother, right?
Brother. l`m your brother.
Okay, take it slow now.
Nice and easy. Nice and slow. He`s still on defense.
Alright?
You tell me what l want to hear.
You and Lazy Boy got this gun from somebody?
You worked for the same person?
What`s his name??
Who`s your boss??
Who are you working for??
Lazy Boy. What the hell is this, man?
What kind of a reporter are you, man?
Moron that didn`t tip-toe the truth, Lerun?
Back off?
And l will not back off until l find out the truth?
Listen to me, don`t let him sailing
your black ass down the river.
You can say ass on TV?
This is a cable TV. l can say whatever that l want.
Let me ask you a question, Lerun.
Did they tell you to plea bargain?
Take the hit. Do the time?
That`s what they said to you, ain`t it?
Yes, that`s what they said.
Now, let`s see if he can get the names out.
But it`s time, Lerun. lt`s time.
lt`s time to shine the light
on who`s really behind this justice.
Who`s the puppet master?
Who`s pushing your button?
You know what l`m saying?
Who`s time that you are doing?
You are doing somebody`s time.
While you are in here, he`s out on the
street smelling the sweet smell of freedom .
Tasting it.
Yeah, what do you smell?
Ass.
Ass, and flea, and tension, and stress.
You know what l`m saying,
brother? That ain`t for you.
Look in that camera.
Look in that camera right now.
Make a connection.
Look right into the lens and say who`s
supposed to be in here instead of you.
Let the people know, get the people involved.
Let the people feel what you are feeling, brother.
You know what l`m saying.
l`m right here with you. l`m right here with you.
All the people at the TV land.
And mama, l`m coming home soon--
Your baby will be home soon,
mama. Will be home soon.
Yes.
The man, the culprit that took me off college,
put me on the streets, do his dirty works,
he shits on my freedom , is none other--
l`m sorry.
This is an emotional moment, l get caught of it.
But when l know that you are going to give the lead--
l love that. Come on, tell it.

His son?
Hope you are watching, bitch?
That`s right. You did the right thing.
Find out where he is.
You are going down, baby.
You made that connection. l can
feel that. l can see the emotion.
l can see the grand swell .
When people see this, they
are going to get rattled up.
l can tell that.
Now, where would a guy like
Marcus, where would he be kicking?
You are trying to get your brother killed, man.
Not at all . You are taking it the wrong way.
We are putting it for the viewers.
Because we are not going to
point no fingers on nobody.
We are not going to say, Oh, Marcus is there.
We are going to say,
if you don`t want to run into a person
like Marcus, don`t go to this place.
He might be in a place like this.
Okay.
You know what l`m saying?
That`s how you got in here, right?
Alright then, look into the camera.
Think about the people. Think
about the babies, the children.
You know what l`m saying?
Save the babies, brother.
Save the babies, brother. Save the babies.
People, and children and TV men
and the kids around the world.
Don`t be like me?
And if you want to stay out of homes and be away,
don`t go to Club Copper Logger on Figger Lane.

He`s just lucky.
Don`t go. Don`t go.
You have done the right thing.
You have done the right thing.
Do you feel good?
Oh, shit, man.

So, now it`s time for us to get down my story.
Talk about where l`m from . Where`s my beginning.
My mama grew in a corn field.
And my grandma was a stripper.
Hold it. Tell you what, why don`t you save
all that for the Oprah Winfrey show, okay?
l`m sure she`ll like to hear all that.
Hey, Mitch, we are going to the club tonight.
Now, what?
How are you doing?
ls the mike going? ls the mike good?
Sorry to bother everybody.
l`m looking for Mr. Marcus.
Who is Mr. Marcus here?
Anybody knows where Mr. Marcus is? Mr. Marcus?
Right there.
Yes. Thank you so much. See how easy that was?
Don`t even bother to get up.
We`ll come over there to you.
Sorry, l always want to do that.
Be right with you, Mr. Marcus.
lnteresting approach.
Yeah, l was just doing my part.
The button-camera is a good idea.
Yeah. Yeah. l told you.
Mr. Marcus?
Yes.
l`m detective Mitch Preston, LAPD .
l`m here to ask you some question.
l`m in the middle of dinner.
Well , l hope this doesn`t ruin your appetite.
l`ve got a strong stomach.
Who is he?
One of your employees. But you know that.
l own a club, a lot of people work for me.
But l don`t know this guy.
What about this guy?
What his name?
He`s big.
Probably big enough to go through those
bullet proof vest that you guys wearing.
Am l right?
Bullet proof vest, huh?
And you are?
You can`t miss me. l`m across
the street, 40 feet high.
You are the TV cops.
Alright. What`s your line again?
lt`s show time.
lt`s show time. lt`s show time.
l told you that it`s a good line.
You see, my friend here interested in
making some arrest in here.
And then what?
What would you do?
Trial me in the people`s court.
l have been watching your punk ass, 247, slick.
Are you going to arrest me?
Because if you are not, get out?
Or, l will have to call the real cops.
Hey, we are the real cops.
Sure you are.
You don`t think we are real cops?
l think you are a joke.
lt`s alright. lt`s alright. He can not touch me.
l can`t touch you this time. But next time
l drag you out here in cuffs.
l guarantee it.
See, l told you. They are a joke.
Right?
lt`s a joke.
lt`s a Show Time joke.
Show time?
That`s great TV?
You realize we can take this car to Sunset Boulevard
and go meet some girls that
wouldn`t normally look twice at us.
Yeah, l pass.
What`s you big rush. You wanna go home and
heat up some dinner plate or something?
Just stop the car.
Alright. Okay.
Alright, l`ll leave you alone.
What`s this?
Your picture-resume?
Put that back there, you don`t have to see that.
l just want to look at it.
All these special skills must come in handy, huh?
Look, l`m not sure about these movies,
this Beach Party Bunzo?
Yes, it`s a semi-independent film .
Very low budget semi-independent.
Planet Golfan 31 A. D .
lt`s kind of light-porn. l don`t want to go into it.
What`s all this? You draft for the village people?
Hey, be careful .
l`m thinking of adding pottery-making into that list.
You are not in pottery.
You know, all the things that we make
and do at the end of the day.
Why would somebody come over and throw a pot?
lf l tell you, would you drop the subject?
Please tell me because l`m dying of curiosity.
My marriage counselor`s idea.
My marriage run into rocks.
He said to take up a hobby.
That`s it?
That`s it.
How are you so crabby at it?
lt`s kind of like you and police work.
l never took it so seriously.
Can l ask you something?
Yeah.
Why do you become a cop anyway?
Because l was a shitty waiter.
l got the car.
You can mind my mouth too. Watch. Watch.
Yeah, l`m impressed.
Thanks for the ride. l`ll see you.
lt`s cool . We got a chance to do a
little bonding, don`t you think?
No. Not really.
What`s the matter?
l never leave my lights on.
Surprise?
What the hell did you do to my place?
You don`t like it?
No? l don`t like it.
Maybe we should call Don Johnson
and tell him to find his apartment?
l don`t know what you and
your band were thinking.
But l want it back the way it was. Now? Now?
Okay, Mitch. Just relax.
Because we didn`t touch the pottery room .
We just want to give a little bit sex appeal .
Sex appeal?
lt looks like a gay porno star lives here.
Yeah. And they are, right here.
Okay, you know what, Trey? Just stop.
You got a lot of nerve, ladies.
You just can`t come in here and change
the whole place without my permission.
You don`t have the right to do this.
And what is this? This dog? Get this dog out of here.
lt`s not mine. lt`s yours, Mitch.
Mine?
l don`t want some dog. What is this?
He`s not just any dog.
He used to be a drug-sniffer in the K-9 unit.
He looks like a drug addict.
Mitch, we want him to make you
look more sympathetic.
Hey, an entire K-9 isn`t
going to make him look sympathetic.
You want me to look sympathetic?
Get all the shit out here and get all my stuff back.
Then l`ll be real sympathetic, until then,
l`m not going to be sympathetic.
How can you say no to that face, Mitch?
l can say no very easy.
No, Powder. Get out?
Hey, what`s the matter with you?
Don`t be like that to the dog.
lt`s a dog, man.
Hey, come here, pal . You are a good boy, aren`t you?
Hey, maybe Mitch is right.
Maybe you should get rid of the dog.
Well , l don`t know. l like his instinct.
Watch your ass, Powder.
Okay. Move it?
Jesus? Dispatch, this is armor--
Go? Go?
Go?
Okay. Annie, get the cam shot.
Julio. Go?
That`s definitely our gun.
Damn? We lost the picture?
Slow down?
There he is.
l got him ? l got him ?
Watch it? Watch it?
Annex, you are getting this?
Yeah?
Come on. Jump?
Jump? Mitch?
Jump?
Jump?
Mitch, you gotta jump?
Come on? Jump now? Come on? Do it?
That was some good hoot-jump.
You alright?
Yeah, you okay?
l think two drops of my pee came out.
You are off the show, Sellars.
You are busted back on patrols.
Well , show time is over.
We are screwed.
Just got back on our tape, top cop.
Being a police office isn`t what the S EAL`s doing.
You have been a cop for 28 years.
l never see you do anything like this.
You put the entire city at risk.
l expected a trade, you know about that, Mitch.
lt`s just escalated.
lt`s over. Mitch, it`s over.
Chief.
l`m pulling the plug of the show.
Good. Good. Now, l can finally get back to work.
No, you can`t. You are off the case.
What?
The PR department has a heart attack.
Yes. This footage is worse than when
you shot the news camera.
Listen, if Marcus gets more of those
guns on the street,
we`ll be far more worse than what we are now.
You ruined it, Mitch.
Now, l`m relieving you from your duty
pending on a full investigation.
Oh, come on. Come on.
You want me to turn in my gun and my badge?
l mean, come on.
Mitch, l just want you to go home for a
few days until the shit storm is settled.
Now, what am l supposed to do at home?
l don`t know, Mitch. Read a book.
Watch some TV. Do your pottery project.
What?
What?
Chase, he`s checking the pecker`s cam .
There`s a camera there in each one of those eyes.
What? ln my woodpecker?
He better not break it.
l told them no camera.
l hope you got all of this.
You hear me? l hope you got it all .
Huh? l hope you got it all .
Great. He broke it.
Sorry. l will get you another one.
You got to talk to this guy, Mitch.
He hates cameras or something.
We are here to take the dog.
The dog stays here.
But we are under orders.
Take that he`s a police officer.
And if you touch him , that will constitute an assault,
and l`ll be forced to shoot you.
Good boy, Powder. Good boy.
Nobody`s taking you away from me.
Trey, forget show time, okay?
We`ll do our own buddy cop show.
l got this treat worked out in my head.
l got this treat. Check this out.
You are Nick Lodd. And l`m John Lark.
l`m Nick who?
Nick Lodd.
Nick Lodd.
You are Nick Lodd. And l`m John Lark.
Put them together, we are Lark And Lodd.
Lark And Lodd. We are the
baldest cop all that will be.
ls that hot?
ls that hot shit or what?
Listen to me, George Clooney has 1 8
shows failed before he hit big with E. R.
You see.
l tell you, it`s not just the show, man.
l don`t want to go back to be a guy
that`s put on a precaution table.
l just want to feel this detective thing.
Listen to me.
You have heat on your acting career now.
lf you are not going strike while iron`s hot.
lt`s going to pass you by.
Hey, man, whatever.
What?
l`m going to see this last episode Show Time.
You are off the show, Sellars.
You are busted back to patrol .
What happens to Mitch?
l saw the tape. He`s relieved from duty.
Look, Mitch is my partner.
Alright, out on the street, he`s the only
person that l can depend on.
Not my family, not my friends, just him .
That`s beautiful , Sellars. What the hell
that you want me to do?
Now, if he`s relieved from his duty,
then l should be relieved too.
And if you want to play it
that way, then you are relieved too.
Okay, l`m be leaving.
Okay.
You want my gun and badge?
Get the hell out of here.
Alright.
Yeah. Who`s this?
Yeah. lt`s me. Mitch.
Are you watching the show?
No. l`m not watching. lt`s ancient history, you know.
lt`s new day, new way.
Yeah, me too.
So, what`s up, man? Why are you calling.
l just want to tell you that what you did
was a pretty stand up thing.
You should take that detective exam .
l`m there for you, you know, if you need anything.
You got questions, whatever,
you know, l`ll be around.
You think l`m going to make a great detective now?
You will make an okay-detective.
l tell you what, let me get that
on my answering machine.
No. l`m going to hang up.
No. No. No. No.
Do you think you can make me a pair
of the shitty mugs that you are making?
You got to be kidding.
Hey, relax. l`m just joking, man.
No. Not you. l just saw something on the show.
So you are watching the show.
Yeah, yeah. l`m watching it.
l`m watching it too. What did you see?
l think l just saw Charlie Harts
towards the department`s ballistic.
That`s the guy you asked to
talk to our guy, Lazy Boy.
The only think is that l got to see again.
Don`t worry.
l`m recording it now. l record them all .
l make my own set.
Why l`m not surprised?
Let me rewind this thing up again.
Hey, it is that guy Charlie Harts.
lt is.
lt is definitely him .
What the hell was he doing with Marcus?
Where`s the light?
We have definitely found our gun maker.
Son of bitch.
No, shit.
What happened to the good old days where
people just grow pots in their garage?
How about we start 69 his last call?
lt`s Mandy. May l help you?
Yeah, Mandy. This is detective
Mitch Preston with the LAPD .
You mean the Mitch?? The LAPD??
That`s me.
Oh, my God?
Now, listen, Mandy. Calm down. Calm down.
We just need want some information about a truck.
Did you rent one to a Charles Harts?
Oh, l`ll just check, honey.
As a matter of a fact, Mr. Harts
just picked one this morning.
He did?
Was there a tracking device on that vehicle?
Yes, Mitch. There was.
There was.

Can l speak to him?
Can you put him on, please?

Alright, man, thanks.
They got a hit of the truck.

Of course l need an ending for the final episode.
Excuse me. My name is Chase Renzi
from hit series, Show Time.
That`s sweet. That`s sweet, thank you.
l`m here today because Shot Time needs your help.
We believe these two men are in the building.
They are armed and extremely dangerous.
Hey, there they are?
Don`t move?
Holy shit?
Mitch? Mitch?
Listen, why don`t let me make
us a nice little demand?
Get in there?
l can help you, you know?
Okay. Calm down.
Let`s move.
Take it easy, alright?
Take it easy. Hey, hey, hey.
Marcus, you got no way out.
l got a list of demand.
Well , let us in. So that you
can tell us what your demands are.
Alright.
But first you slide your weapons in here.
What did you say? What did he say?
l don`t know.
What?
l said to slide your weapons in here.
He said--
What did you say?
What`s the matter? You don`t understand English?
Slide in your weapons.
Oh, slide in the weapons.
lt`s alright. l got backup.
Guys, hold on. l got to change the tape.
You are thinking what l`m thinking.
Yeah, l am .
Mitch, no, no. What are you doing?
Did you hear me?
Hold on?
Don`t do that. Oh, man?
l got a list of demands.
You see those news choppers out there?
We are doing live. We got a camera man out here.
So you can give your list of demand.
You can tell them what you want.
Okay. Throw in your weapons.
Here they come.
Clear?
Okay. There are the guns.
Stay there?
Okay. Easy. Easy.
Stay there?
Okay. Alright. Just take it easy.
Where`s the camera man?
He`s afraid. So he stays out there.
We don`t want to put anybody in danger.
So, you know, detective Preston
is going to do the shooting here.
l do.
Have you ever been on TV before?
Okay, it`s really simple.
All you have to do is to look into the red light,
into the lens, tell the people what`s on your mind.
Okay?
You got that all lined up?
Okay.
Yeah.
Let`s shoot.
Okay. Alright.
lt`s Show Time.
Mitch?
You okay?
Mitch?
Trey? Trey? Where are you?
Over here?
What are you doing? What are you doing?
Hold on?
Oh, God?
lt`s your turn for the camera.
Get that camera out of here?
Keep that camera right where it is?
You`ll deal with it, girl . Go.
What`s going on with your new recruits here?
They are not bonding like the way we`re bonding.
Yeah, they don`t have that
special chemistry that we have.
No, they certainly don`t.
Which is why the two of you are going
to be the guest star in the next episode.
Kind of showing them how to do it, huh?
No way, not in a million years.
You know, he means yes.
l know he means yes. l`m working on it.
l love you.
See you.
So nice. Look at what you get. Look at what l get?
Nothing.
Don`t go anywhere. Here. Here.
l made you something for passing that
detective exam , you know?
Oh, man. That`s so nice of you.
Oh, Mitch, that`s nice.
What is that?
What the hell is it?
lt`s a loose-change dish.
Oh, yeah. Of course, it`s a loose-change dish.
Of course it is. lt`s just l haven`t
see this level of craftsmanship
since back in the kindergarten days.
lt is appreciated, partner.
Thank you.
Detective Sellars. Detective Preston.
Your suspect is in the interrogation room .
Yeah. Be right with you.
l like the sound of it. Detective Sellars.
lt adds a ring to it, doesn`t it?
