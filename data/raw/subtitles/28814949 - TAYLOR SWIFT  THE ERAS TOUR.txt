It's been

Oh, hi!
(AUDIENCE CHEERS)
Fever dream high
in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it
Bad, bad boy
Shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it
Killing me slow
Out the window
I'm always waiting for you
to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice
Angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me
makes me want you more
And it's new
The shape of your body
It's blue
The feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa, oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool
That's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa, oh
It's a cruel summer
With you
Hang your head low
In the glow
of the vending machine
I'm not dying
You say
that we'll just screw it up
In these trying times
We're not trying
So cut the headlights
Summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you
just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice
Angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed
You'll be the last to know
Oh, it's new
The shape of your body
It's blue
The feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa, oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool
That's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa, oh
It's a cruel summer
With you
All right, Los Angeles,

Does anyone here know

-Prove it!
(SINGING) I'm drunk
in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby
coming home from the bar
Oh
Said, "I'm fine"
But it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets
just to keep you
And I snuck in
through the garden gate
Every night that summer
just to seal my fate
Oh
And I screamed
for whatever it's worth
"I love you"
Ain't that the worst thing
you ever heard?
He looks up
grinning like a devil
It's new
The shape of your body
It's blue

(SINGING)
I would be complex
I would be cool
They'd say
I played the field
Before I found
someone to commit to
And that would be okay
For me to do
Every conquest I had made
Would make me
more of a boss to you
I'd be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?
I'm so sick of running
as fast as I can
Wondering
if I'd get there quicker
If I was a man
And I'm so sick of them
coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man
Then I'd be the man
-I'd be the man
-Man
-I'd be the man
-Man
They'd say I hustled
Put in the work
They wouldn't
shake their heads
And question
how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing
If I was rude
Could all be separated
From my good ideas
and power moves
And they would
toast to me, oh
-Hey!
-Let the players play
I'd be just like Leo
In Saint-Tropez
I'm so sick of running
as fast as I can
Wondering
if I'd get there quicker
If I was a man
And I'm so sick of them

'Cause if I was a man

What's it like
to brag about
Raking in dollars
And getting
bitches and models
And it's all good
if you're bad
And it's okay
if you're mad
If I was out
flashing my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out
to be bad
So it's okay that I'm mad

to play with tonight.
I get to sing with you,
and dance with you,
and vibe with you,
and hang out with you
all night. Look at you.
-(AUDIENCE CHEERS)
-You know,
we get a good sense of a crowd
in the first couple of songs.
We realize if
it's going to be
like a soulmate crowd
situation,
and it feels so promising,
I just have to
tell you that.
It's looking so good.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
So you and I,
we're about to go on
a little adventure together.
And that adventure is going
to span 17 years of music,
and it's going to be
one era at a time.
-How does that sound to you?
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
All right,
so let me tell you
my secret little dream
for this evening.
So these are songs
that I have written
about my life
or things I felt
at one point in time
whether I was a teenager,
in my 20s,
or a couple years ago,
but after tonight,
when you hear these songs
out and about in the world,
my dream is that you're gonna
think about tonight
and the memories we made
here together at SoFi Stadium.
(AUDIENCE CHEERS)
I'll be your host
this evening.
My name is Taylor.
Thank you for traveling
with us here
at The Eras Tour.
(LOVER PLAYING)
(SINGING) We could leave
the Christmas lights
up till January
This is our place
We make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze
A mysterious way
about you, dear
Have I known you
20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, and, ah
Take me out
and take me home
You're my, my, my, my
Lover
We could let our friends
crash in the living room
This is our place
We make the call
And I'm highly suspicious
That everyone who sees you
wants you
I've loved you
three summers now, honey
But I want 'em all
-Can I go where you go?
-(BACKUP SINGERS VOCALIZING)
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, and, ah
Take me out
and take me home
Forever and ever
You're my, my, my, my
Lover
Ladies and gentlemen
Will you please stand?
With every guitar string
scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force
of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed
and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well
to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic
and true to my lover
And you'll save
All your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table
I'll save you a seat
Lover
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, and, ah
Take me out
and take me home
Forever and ever
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Oh, darling

You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna
ask you to dance right there
In the middle
of the parking lot
Yeah
(AUDIENCE CHEERS)
We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard
not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands
through your hair
Absentmindedly
makin' me want you
And I don't know
how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me
headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why
but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
Well, you stood there
with me in the doorway
My hands shake
I'm not usually this way
But you pull me in
and I'm a little more brave

it's flawless
Really somethin'
It's fearless

You're on the phone
with your girlfriend
She's upset
She's going off about
something that you said
She doesn't
get your humor like I do
I'm in my room
It's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind
of music she doesn't like
And she'll never
know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain
and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day
when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for
has been here the whole time
If you could see
that I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
You belong with me
Walk in the streets with you
in your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking
this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench
thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile
That can light up
this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while
since she brought you down
You say you're fine
I know you better than that
Hey, what you doing
with a girl like that?
She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain
and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day
when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for
has been here the whole time
If you could see
that I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by
and waiting at your back door
All this time
How could
you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me
(ELECTRIC GUITAR SOLO)
Oh, I remember you
driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one
who makes you laugh
When you know
you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me
'bout your dreams
Think I know
where you belong
Think I know it's with me
Can't you see
that I'm the one
Who understands you?
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by
and waiting at your back door
All this time
How could
you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought
just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me

We were both young
when I first saw you
I close my eyes
and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights
See the party
The ball gowns
See you make your way
through the crowd
-And say, "Hello"
-(AUDIENCE SCREAMS)
Little did I know
That you were Romeo
You were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said
"Stay away from Juliet"
And I was cryin'
on the staircase
Beggin' you
"Please don't go"
And I said
Romeo, take me
somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting
All there's left to do
is run
You'll be the prince
and I'll be the princess
It's a love story
Baby, just say, "Yes"
So I sneak out
to the garden to see you
We keep quiet
'Cause we're dead
if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town
for a little while, oh oh
'Cause you were Romeo
I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said
"Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything
to me
I was beggin' you
"Please don't go"
And I said
Romeo, take me
somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting
All there's left to do
is run
You'll be the prince
and I'll be the princess
It's a love story
Baby, just say, "Yes"
Romeo, save me
They're tryna tell me
how to feel
This love is difficult
But it's real
Don't be afraid
We'll make it
out of this mess
It's a love story
Baby, just say, "Yes"
Oh, oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were
ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you
on the outskirts of town
And I said
Romeo, save me
I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you
but you never come
Is this in my head?
I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground
And pulled out a ring
And said
"Marry me, Juliet
"You'll never
have to be alone
"I love you
and that's all I really know
"I talked to your dad
Go pick out a white dress
"It's a love story
Baby, just say, 'Yes'"

I'm like the water
When your ship
rolled in that night
Rough on the surface
But you cut through
like a knife
And if it was
an open-shut case
I never would've known
from the look on your face
Lost in your current
like a priceless wine
The more that you say
The less I know
Wherever you stray
I follow
I'm begging for you
to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man
Life was a willow
And it bent
right to your wind
BACKUP SINGERS: Oh
Head on the pillow
I could feel you sneaking in
As if you were
a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy

And there was one prize
I'd cheat to win

The less I know
Wherever you stray
I follow
I'm begging for you
to take my hand
Wreck my plans

You know that my train
could take you home

to take my hand
Wreck my plans

Wait for the signal
And I'll meet you
after dark
Show me the places where
the others gave you scars
Now this is
an open-shut case
Guess I should've known
from the look on your face
Every bait and switch
was a work of art
The more that you say
The less I know

If I didn't know better
I'd think
you were still around
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive
You're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive
The autumn chill
that wakes me up
You loved the amber skies
so much
Long limbs
and frozen swims
You'd always go past
where our feet could touch
And I complained
the whole way there
The car ride back
and up the stairs
I should've
asked you questions
I should've
asked you how to be
Asked you
to write it down for me
Should've kept
every grocery store receipt
'Cause every scrap of you
would be taken from me
Watched as you signed
your name Marjorie
All your closets
of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all
to me
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive
You're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive
And if I didn't
know better
I'd think you were
singing to me now

of my entire life.
Being on this tour,

with you.
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
-(FUMBLES)
I know you're supposed to,

You're supposed to be like,
"Oh, I like you guys

than anything I've ever done
or been a part of in my life.
This tour. So... (CHUCKLES)
(SIGHS)
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
-(PLAYING SOFT MUSIC ON PIANO)
Ah.
And, you know,
before this tour,
I would... I would go
through this process
where I'd make an album,
and I'd call the album
something like
Red or Speak Now or Fearless
or, you know.
And then I'd go,
I'd put together a tour called
the name of that album, right?
Like the 1989 tour,
Speak Now tour.
And we'd do it like that.
(CHUCKLES)
And I remember like,
why am I just do...
What is this...?
-(AUDIENCE WHOOPS)
-Why?
Anyway, um,
so with this tour,
(CHUCKLES)
I remember people
would come up to me
and they'd be like,
"So you've put out,
like, five albums
"that you haven't
done tours for.
"So what's your plan? Like,
what are you going to do?
"You're going to just,
like, do a show
"with, like,
all the albums in it
"and it'll be like, what?
"Like, a three-and-a-half
hour long show?"

-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
-(PLAYING PIANO)
(LAUGHS)
So we are currently
in the evermore Era and, um...
and that was my second
pandemic album that I made.
And I remember there was...
There was one specific song
where after I wrote it
I thought, you know,
that would be
a really cathartic
experience,
I'm sure, to get
to sing Champagne Problems
-in a stadium, you know?
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
So let's do it.
(PLAYING CHAMPAGNE PROBLEMS)
(SINGING)
You booked the night train
for a reason
So you could sit there
in this hurt
Bustling crowds
or silent sleepers
You're not sure
which is worse
Because I dropped your hand
while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring
in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass
I dropped it
Champagne problems
You told your family
for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out
on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating
Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends
applauded
Your hometown skeptics
called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech
You're speechless
Love slipped
beyond your reaches
And I couldn't
give a reason
Champagne problems
-(BACKUP SINGERS VOCALIZING)
-(INSTRUMENTAL BREAK)
Your Midas touch
on the Chevy door
November flush
and your flannel cure
"This dorm was
once a madhouse"
I made a joke
"Well, it's made for me"
How evergreen
Our group of friends
Don't think
we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have
the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money
Two for the show
I never was ready
so I watch you go
Sometimes you just
don't know the answer
Till someone's
on their knees and asks you

such a lovely bride
"What a shame she's fucked
in the head," they said
But you'll find
the real thing instead
She'll patch up
your tapestry that I shred
And hold your hand
while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring
in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems
You won't remember all my

I sit and watch you
reading with your head low
I wake and watch you
Breathing
with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything
you do or don't do
You're so much older
and wiser and I
I wait by the door
like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors
for your portrait
Lay the table
with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head
Tell me now
Tell me
I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love
should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
While you were out building
other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man
Who'd throw blankets
over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple
My mural, my sky
Now I'm begging
for footnotes
In the story of your life
Drawing hearts
in the byline
Always taking up
too much space or time
You assume I'm fine
But what would you do if I
(BACKUP SINGERS VOCALIZING)
Break free
and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me
and removed it
Gain the weight of you
Then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head
Tell me now
Tell me
I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love
should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
I sit and watch you

Forcing laughter
Faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

Enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered
"Have we met?"
Across the room
Your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful
conversation starts
Counter all
your quick remarks
Like passing notes
in secrecy
And it was
Enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was
Enchanted to meet you

I walked through
the door with you
The air was cold
But something 'bout it
felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there
at your sister's house
And you've still got it
in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition
and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car
Getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down
like pieces into place
And I can picture it
after all these days
And I know
it's long gone and
That magic's not here
no more
And I might be okay
But I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause there we are again
on that little town street
You almost ran the red
'Cause you were
lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it
all too well
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid
With glasses
in a twin-sized bed
Your mother's telling
stories 'bout you
On the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past
Thinking your future
was me
And you were tossing me
the car keys
"Fuck the patriarchy"
Keychain on the ground
We were always
skipping town
And I was thinking
on the drive down
Any time now
He's gonna say it's love
You never called it
what it was
Till we were dead and gone
and buried
Check the pulse and come back
Swearing it's the same
After three months
in the grave
And then you wondered
where it went to
As I reached for you
But all I felt was shame
And you held
my lifeless frame
And I know
it's long gone and
There was nothing else
I could do
And I forget about you
long enough
To forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again
in the middle of the night
We're dancing
'round the kitchen
In the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again
when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret
but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it
All too well, yeah
(INSTRUMENTAL BREAK)
Well, maybe we got
lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing
was a masterpiece
Till you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me
like a promise
So casually cruel in
the name of "being honest"
I'm a crumpled up
piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it
all, all, all
They say all's well
that ends well
But I'm in a new hell
Every time
you double-cross my mind
You said if we had
been closer in age
Maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me
Who was she?
A never-needy
ever-lovely jewel
Whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping
in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me
what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad
with self-effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like
you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch
the front door all night
Willing you to come
And he said
"It's supposed to be fun

you made me your own
Now you mail back my things
and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you
of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it
All too well, yeah
'Cause there we are again
when I loved you so
Back before you lost
The one real thing
you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair
You were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs
You were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
And I was never good
at telling jokes
But the punch line goes
"I'll get older
But your lovers stay my age"
From when your Brooklyn
broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's
returning half her weight
And did the twin flame
bruise paint you blue?
Just between us
Did the love affair
maim you, too?
'Cause in this city's
barren cold
I still remember
the first fall of snow

I'm doing good
I'm on some new shit
Been saying "yes"
instead of "no"
I thought I saw you
at the bus stop
I didn't though
I hit the ground running
each night
I hit the Sunday matinee
You know the greatest films
of all time were never made
I guess you never know
Never know
And if you wanted me
You really should've showed
And if you never bleed
You're never gonna grow
And it's all right now
But we were something
Don't you think so?
Roaring twenties
Tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving
well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
Ooh
I have this dream
you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman
on the Internet
And take her home
(AUDIENCE SCREAMING
AND CHEERING)
We never painted
by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves
of all time are over now
I guess you never know
Never know
And it's another day
Waking up alone
But we were something
Don't you think so?
Roaring twenties
Tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving
well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
Hey, yeah-yeah
I persist and resist
the temptation to ask you
If one thing
had been different
Would everything
be different today?
We were something
Don't you think so?
Rosé flowing
with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up
the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been

that I am extremely proud of,
-and I started, uh...
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
Aw...
-Aw... thanks.
-(CHEERING CONTINUES)
(SWIFT CHUCKLES)
I immediately
was picturing
this album taking place
in the woods,
in an imaginary cabin.
In my fantasy,
in my imagination,
I am not
a lonely millennial woman
covered in cat hair,
-um...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
...watching 700 hours
of TV a day.
In my imagination,
I am like a...
like a woodsy Victorian lady
who is wandering
through the forest,
holding, like,
a candlestick holder-thing
and, like, you know,
collecting feathers
to make my own quill
to write on parchment paper.
It was a whole thing.
That was how I pictured myself
when I was writing folklore.
And then I was like,
you know, maybe
I should do some other things
different on this album.
Maybe I should try
creating characters
and having these characters
fall in love
and break up and...
-(LOUD CHEERING)
-(GUITAR PLAYING)
One of my favorite, um,
characters that I created
is, uh, I call it
the Teenage Love Triangle.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
The catalyst character is
this teenage boy named James,
and he
really screws things up
with the love of his life,
and he has
to apologize to her,
and try to make it right,
and long story short,
-her name is Betty.
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
(BETTY PLAYING)
Betty, I won't
make assumptions
About why you switched
your homeroom
But I think
it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding
on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like
I couldn't breathe
You heard the rumors
from Inez
You can't believe
a word she says
Most times
But this time it was true
The worst thing
that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up
at your party
Would you have me?
Would you want me?
Would you tell me
to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden
would you trust me
If I told you
it was just a summer thing?
I'm only 17
I don't know anything
but I know I miss you
Betty, I know
where it all went wrong
Your favorite song
was playing
From the far side
of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds
You know that
Plus, I saw you dance
with him
You heard the rumors
from Inez
You can't believe
a word she says
Most times
But this time it was true
The worst thing
that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up

In the garden

If I told you

I'm only 17
I don't know anything
but I know I miss you
I was walking home
on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you
when she pulled up
Like a figment
of my worst intentions
She said
"James, get in, let's drive"
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her but
I dreamt of you
all summer long
Betty, I'm here
on your doorstep
And I planned it out
for weeks now
But it's finally
sinking in
Betty, right now
is the last time
I can dream
about what happens
When you see my face again
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So, I showed up at your party
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
Yeah, I showed up
at your party
(MUSIC BUILDING)
Yeah, I showed up
at your party
Will you have me?
Will you love me?
Will you kiss me
on the porch
In front of
all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me
Will it be
just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch
your broken wings?
I'm only 17
I don't know anything
But I know I miss you
Standing in your cardigan
Kissing in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you

(THE LAST GREAT
AMERICAN DYNASTY PLAYING)
Rebekah rode up
on the afternoon train
It was sunny
Her saltbox house
on the coast
Took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir
to the Standard Oil name
And money
And the town said
"How did a middle-class
divorcée do it?"
The wedding was charming
If a little gauche
There's only so far
new money goes
They picked out a home
And called it "Holiday House"
Their parties were tasteful
If a little loud
The doctor had told him
to settle down
It must have been her fault
his heart gave out
And they said
"There goes the last great
American dynasty
"Who knows
If she never showed up
"What could've been
(MOUTHING)
"There goes
the maddest woman
"This town has ever seen
"She had a marvelous time
ruining everything"
Rebekah gave up on
the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack
friends from the city
Filled the pool
with champagne
And swam with the big names
And blew through the money
on the boys and the ballet
And losing on
card game bets with Dalí
And they said
"There goes the last
great American dynasty
"Who knows
If she never showed up
"What could've been
(MOUTHING)
"There goes
the most shameless woman
"This town has ever seen
"She had a marvelous time
ruining everything"
They say
she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring
out at the midnight sea
And in a feud
with her neighbor
She stole his dog
and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly
on that beach
Free of women with madness
Their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
Who knows, if I never
showed up what could've been
There goes the loudest woman

Salt air
And the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers
Of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"

Lost in the memory
August slipped away
into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us
twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were
never mine, mine
Your back
Beneath the sun
Wishing I could
write my name on it
Will you call
When you're back at school?
I remember thinking
I had you
But I can see us

We gather stones
Never knowing
what they'll mean
Some to throw
Some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to
Have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels
That I gave you
As you bury me
I didn't have it in myself
to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight
You used to tell me
I was brave
And if I'm dead to you
Why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
Look at how
my tears ricochet
And I can go
anywhere I want
Anywhere I want
Just not home
And you can aim
for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me
in your bones
And I still talk to you
When I'm screaming
at the sky
And when you can't
sleep at night
You hear
my stolen lullabies
I didn't have it in myself
to go with grace
And so the battleships
will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me
But it killed you
just the same
Cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
You turned into
your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame
Drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name

When I dreamed up the idea
of The Eras Tour,
I thought it would be
really fun to sort of
go back through
all these different phases
I've had musically,
because it's been,
I mean, it's been
a little bit of everything.
You've been so kind to me
in letting me explore genres
and step outside boxes
that are created for us
in the music industry.
And that's only because of you
that I get to do that.
So, thank you...
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
...because it's just
so much fun.
It's just so much fun
to get to play,
and to get to experiment,
and to get to grow
as an artist.
But I did want to play a song
just to thank the people
who liked me
when I was a little teenager
writing songs
for my ninth grade
talent show.
(PLAYING OUR SONG)
(SINGING)
I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel
On the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around
Turn the radio down
He says
"Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothing
I was just thinking
"How we don't have a song"
And he says
Our song is
the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late
Tapping on your window
When we're on the phone
and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late
and your mama don't know
Our song
is the way you laugh
The first date
"Man, I didn't kiss her
and I should have"
And when I got home
'fore I said, "Amen"
Asking God
if he could play it again
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
I was walking up
The front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong
And been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway
Well, on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice
All the roses
And the note that said
Our song is
the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late
Tapping on your window
When we're on the phone
and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late
and your mama don't know
Our song
is the way you laugh
The first date
"Man, I didn't kiss her
and I should have"
And when I got home
'fore I said, "Amen"
Asking God
if he could play it again
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
I've heard every album
Listened to the radio
Waited for something
to come along
That was as good as our song
'Cause our song is
the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late
Tapping on his window
When we're on the phone
and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late
and his mama don't know
Our song
is the way he laughs
The first date
"Man, I didn't kiss him
and I should have"
And when I got home
'fore I said, "Amen"
Asking God
if he could play it again
Play it again
Oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah
I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen
And an old napkin
And I wrote down our song

(PLAYING
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN, KID)
Summer went away
Still the yearning stays
I play it cool
with the best of them
I wait patiently
He's gonna notice me
It's okay
We're the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice
You're smoking
with your boys
I touch my phone
as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town
I dream of getting out
There's just one
who could make me stay
All my days
From sprinkler splashes
to fireplace ashes
I waited ages
to see you there
I search the party
of better bodies
Just to learn
that you never cared
You're on your own, kid
You always have been
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
I see the great escape
So long, Daisy May
I picked the petals
He loves me not
Something different bloomed
Writing in my room
I play my songs
in the parking lot
I'll run away
From sprinkler splashes
to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi
to take me there
I search the party
of better bodies
Just to learn
that my dreams aren't rare
You're on your own, kid
You always have been
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
From sprinkler splashes
to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat
and tears for this
I hosted parties
and starved my body
Like I'd be saved
by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren't funny
I took the money
My friends from home
don't know what to say
I looked around
in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something
they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned
With the bridges burned
Everything you lose
is a step you take
So make
the friendship bracelets
Take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason
to be afraid
You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

I have this thing
where I get older
But just never wiser
Midnights become
my afternoons
When my depression
works the graveyard shift
All of the people
I've ghosted
stand there in the room
I should not be left
to my own devices
They come with prices
and vices
I end up in crisis
BACKUP SINGERS:
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming
from dreaming
One day
I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired
of my scheming
BACKUP SINGERS:
For the last time
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly
at the sun
But never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always
rooting for the anti-hero
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
Sometimes, I feel like
everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out
Slowly lurching toward
your favorite city
Pierced through the heart
but never killed
Did you hear
my covert narcissism
I disguise as altruism
Like some kind
of congressman?
BACKUP SINGERS:
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming
from dreaming
One day
I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose
all its meaning
BACKUP SINGERS:

I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly

But never in the mirror

rooting for the anti-hero
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
I have this dream
My daughter-in-law kills me
for the money
She thinks I left them
in the will
The family gathers 'round
and reads it
And then someone
screams out
"She's laughing up at us
from hell"
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees

BACKUP SINGER:
(LOW-PITCHED) Rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight
My town
was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens
and big pretenders
But for some it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow motion, love potion
Jumping off things
in the ocean
I broke his heart
'cause he was nice
He was sunshine
I was midnight
BACKUP SINGER:
(LOW-PITCHED) Rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame

All of me changed
Like midnight
It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away
'Cause he was sunshine
I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

Just what we wanted
Just what we wanted
And he never thinks of me
Except when I'm on TV

Some kind of haunted

Draw the cat eye

I don't start shit, but
I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even

She needed cold hard proof
so I gave her some
She had the envelope
Where you think
she got it from?
Now she gets the house
Gets the kids
Gets the pride
Picture me thick as thieves
with your ex-wife
And she looks so pretty
Driving in your Benz
Lately she's been
dressing for revenge

She don't start shit

Lately she's been

Ladies always rise above
Ladies know
what people want
Someone sweet
and kind and fun
The lady simply had enough
While he was doing lines
And crossing all of mine
Someone told
his white collar crimes
To the FBI
And I don't
dress for villains
Or for innocents
I'm on my vigilante shit again
I don't start shit, but
I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even

Baby love, I think I've been
a little too kind
Didn't notice you walking
all over my peace of mind
In the shoes
I gave you as a present
Putting someone first
only works
When you're in their top five
And by the way
I'm going out tonight
Best believe
I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make
the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask
"Do you have a man?"
I could still say
"I don't remember"
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse
of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real
I polish up real nice
Nice
Baby boy, I think I've been
too good of a girl
BACKUP SINGERS:
Too good of a girl
Did all the extra credit
Then got graded on a curve
I think it's time
to teach some lessons
I made you my world
Have you heard?
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you
But I miss sparkling
Nice
Best believe
I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make

And when I meet the band
They ask

Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse

Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real
I polish up real nice
Nice
Sapphire tears on my face
Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said
my aura's moonstone
Just 'cause he was high
And we're dancing all night
And you can try
To change my mind
But you might have
to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do?
A diamond's gotta shine

(MASTERMIND PLAYING)
Once upon a time
the planets and the fates
And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up
in the same room
At the same time
And the touch of a hand
lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction
of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose
What if I told you
none of it was accidental?
And the first night
that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork
and then just like clockwork
The dominoes
cascaded in a line
What if I told you
I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all my design
'Cause I'm a mastermind
You see all the wisest women
had to do it this way
'Cause we were born to be
The pawn
in every lover's game
If you fail to plan
You plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene
for the tale
I'm the wind
in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor
in our cocktails
What if I told you
none of it was accidental?
And the first night
that you saw me
I knew I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork
and then just like clockwork
The dominoes
cascaded in a line
What if I told you
I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all my design
'Cause I'm a mastermind
No one wanted to play
with me as a little kid
So I've been scheming
like a criminal ever since
To make them love me
and make it seem effortless
This is the first time I've
felt the need to confess
And I swear
I'm only cryptic
and Machiavellian
'Cause I care
So I told you none of it
was accidental
And the first night
that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork
and then saw a wide smirk
On your face
You knew the entire time
You knew
that I'm a mastermind
And now you're mine
Yeah, all you did
was smile
'Cause I'm a mastermind

Addicted to betrayal

just to get there
It's coming back around
And I keep my side

You wouldn't know

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze
in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious

Sweet like honey
Karma is a cat
Purring in my lap

Trick me once, trick me twice

cash ain't the only price?

Karma takes all my friends

But what if I'm all right
Right, right, right here?
And I cut off
My nose

I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire
Invisible smoke
And all of my heroes
die all alone

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your

Ah-ah, ha
