MICHAEL: I like girls Almost all of them
That's why it was strange with Gabby
I stopped looking at anyone else
It wasn't only the fact that she was
beautiful, it was something else
Something sort of mysterious
I didn't have a name for it
But it always kept me wanting her
And then she left
in the middle of the semester
She didn't even say goodbye
When I called her, she told me it was
because her granny was sick
Very sick
Although I knew
her family meant a lot to her,
when she didn't come back,
I began to think it was something else
Then, just when I sunk to
my lowest point, she came to her senses
She called me up and asked me
to Quebec City for Christmas
Meeting the family
The significance of this request
did not escape me
I was about to spend
the best week of my life

- Guess who?
- Gabby!
- Hi.
- Hi.
Everyone's really looking forward
to meeting you.
- They're all at home?
- Yeah. The family.
'Cause I called and nobody answered.
Oh, yeah,
sometimes they don't answer the phone.
- But didn't you think it might be me?
- What?
No, nothing. Here we go.
- You look beautiful.
- What?
- You look beautiful.
- Oh, thanks.
(INAUDIBLE)
- How's everyone at school?
- They all miss you.

Hi, Michael. I'm Irenka.

No, no.

GABBY: Daddy's writing a book
about Pascal's Pensees
Oh, okay.
- He can't work with his clothes on.
- Michael, Daddy's an atheist.
Simone, it's nothing to joke about.
The girl's lack of respect doesn't...
Doesn't surprise me!
Come on, Michael. Sit down.
How was the flight?
- Well...
- Pretty hairy, I'll bet.
Air travel, it's the bane of my life.
Do you know the problem with those jets?
Once the engine cuts, that's it.
Straight down. They're built like rockets.
Propeller planes, now,
they're built on the principle of the glider.
But jets? Bang! End of journey.

Take Nick, here.
He flies the damn things.
Courting death, if you ask me.

Nick, we got a problem with this blender.
- Lives in a world of its own.

Sorry.

- Have you met someone?
- No, no, it's not like that at all.

It's been worrying me, you know.
- When you came, I just knew.
- That didn't take very long.
I mean, I only just got here.
Don't be like that.
(SIGHING)
Oh, Gabby.
Please, Mikey, don't, okay?
Then why did you invite me, then?
- I mean, if that isn't a dumb question?
- Look, look... I am glad that you came.
Well, couldn't we wait
and just see how things turn out?
I just don't see
how it's going to be any different.
That's reassuring.
- Don't be like that.
- How do you want me to be?
I don't know why
you're getting so angry at me.
All I wanted to do was to see you.
And I'm glad that you came.
You didn't have to come.

I'm going to bed.
I don't believe this.
You called me up, invited me over,

that we are interfering,
but your father and I heard you
going upstairs with Michael.
Yes?
And I don't think that you should
go into your bedroom together.
- But I was only just coming upstairs...
- Gabriella,
men sometimes in a bedroom
can't control themselves.
Something comes over them
and regrettable things could happen.
I'm not saying
that Michael is one of those.
But it's just one of those things
that you should...

- We do worry.
Don't we, Ego? Ego?

Of course we do.

Father Walter once asked me
to marry him,
but I didn't love him like that.
And he became a priest.
He was always my mother's favorite.
And afterwards, she blamed my husband
for having eroticized me.
Women sometimes can be
very susceptible.
(BELLS TOLLING)
MRS. D'ARC: Give her my love.
GABBY: Goodbye, Mama.
Goodbye.
I'm freezing.
- Do you tell Father Walter everything?
- What do you mean?
- Well, confess everything.
- No. No.
Dad doesn't really think we should go
to confession at all, so...
Irenka and I, we decided that we'd just
tell him certain things. You know.
Well, is that right? I mean,
aren't you meant to confess everything?
Well, it's not really
a question of what's right.
It's just what we've decided. Come on.
MICHAEL: Gabby seemed
to have completely forgotten
about the night before
That was okay with me
I had a theory: Territoriality
This was their environment
Like a lion's den
No one was welcome but the lions
I was the intruder, the hyena
That's always difficult

MICHAEL: How come she knew my name?
I've never met her.
It was weird.
- What's going on?
- That's not always so clear.
- Vaguely.
- Vaguely?
She seems to think
she's living, like, 20 years ago,
when her husband was still alive.
His name was Michael.
She's, you know, got kangaroos
in the top attic.
- That is weird.
- It's fucking weird.
Weirdness surrounds them.
- IRENKA: Sorry we were so long.
- That's okay.
- NICK: How's she doing?

You okay?
She didn't seem to recognize us.
It was weird.

Yeah. It's horrible.

I hope Granny gets well again.
She calls you up out of the blue, right?
Invites you here for Christmas.
(REGGAE MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)
And once you get here,
she says
that she thinks
she doesn't love you anymore?
No...
Not exactly that.
- A cigarette?
- You're wrong. No, thank you.
- Peanut?
- No.
Hey, don't get me wrong.
I'm not making a joke out of it.
It's just, you got to realize,
these people got no respect for anyone
but themselves.
Hey, calm down.
I'm getting out soon.
Soon as spring comes.
I'm going to go up north
and train to fly helicopters.
- Sounds great.
- It will be. It'll be great.
- What about Irenka?
- I don't know. We'll have to see.
(SIGHS)
Hey, don't tell anybody, okay?
It's just, she doesn't exactly know yet.
Hey, I'll tell you what.
See if you can get Gabby
to go up to the country.
Things are better up there.
Things will settle down and work out.
I think I know her pretty well.
I mean, everybody has
their ups and downs.
- What?
- Ups and downs!
Oh, God,
you wouldn't believe the shit I've seen.

Sorry, I thought...
Boy, it is cold in here.
- It is?
- Yeah.
It is, you're right.
I remember from before,
when I was awake.
I was talking to Gabby
about what was going on.
Do you think there's any hope?
Do you mean,
do I think she's going to die?
Oh, no, you mean with you and Gabby.
Well, I don't think you should leave.
We're all just getting to know you.
You know?
I only just got here.
Well, I know. I mean, I know Gabby.
She really likes you.
She has a strange way of showing it.
- Michael?
- Yeah?
I don't want you to go.
(STUTTERING) None of us do.

Okay, I think that's all I wanted to say.
Yeah, okay.

I feel like I have been let down,
that the things that I tried to teach you...
(STAMMERING) Well, I think
you have taught her so well.
GABBY: Nothing has happened.
Yeah, that's true.
And I do love Michael.
MRS. D'ARC: Well, I don't want you to think
that we are interfering,
but caring about one's daughter
is not interfering.

Very well, have a nice lunch.
Thank you.

I was out of the running
for guest of the year
Still, it was Gabby who worried me most
Wine?
I had a theory: I was trying too hard
There's nothing women hate more
than that
What I had to do was back off
and let her come to me
These things lead on.
(GIGGLING)
Even if she got down on her hands
and knees and begged me for it,
I'd say, '"No, no, thank you
'"No Thank you very much,

But it was summer then
It was so cold out there
What was she trying to find?
But at least we were out of the house
Maybe Nick was right
Maybe things would be better up there
She's not here!

- I'm getting something to eat.
No, Nick. We've got to go look now.
If she's out there, she's probably lost.
It's getting dark, it's cold.
We've got to go look.
Well, we'll find her
now that I got something to eat.
You're disgusting.
If she dies, it is on your head.

I've thought about it,
and I know now that I'm right.
I don't love you anymore.

When Michael died,

to scatter his ashes in the lake.
And with your mother and father,
we took out our little boat.
I tipped the urn over the side

the wind blew the ashes all over us.
Nobody said anything.
I laughed.
Then we all laughed
and rowed back to the shore,
brushing off the ashes.

On the last day of summer,
a young girl
left her summer shoes
in the branches of a tree.
They were wonderful shoes.
Wonderful shoes.
I just wanted to come home once more.

Keeping warm.
I got some water.
- Were you cold upstairs?
- No.
- Just when I came down here.

When Beowulf was a puppy,

Mama made him sleep downstairs.

so I brought my blanket down for him.
And in the morning,
Daddy found us asleep in front of the fire,
and he was all curled up around my chin.
(SIGHING)
You know, I'm glad Granny came up here,
even though we tried to stop her.
I know. Seems so simple.
You know Nick's been unfaithful to me?
No. I didn't.
He has.
I always wanted to be able not to mind,
but I just do.
See, I always thought
that kissing someone
meant just as much
as making love to him.
It's the idea.
Kissing?
Kissing.
Okay, bye.
I've got to go back to bed.
(SIGHING)
(EX CLAIMING)
No! No!
(GRUNTING)
- Hi, Irenka.
- Hi!
Hi, Gabby!
NICK: Jesus, you'd think they hadn't seen
each other for years.
(LAUGHING)
I don't want to stay here.
I want to get back.
SIMONE: Can I get on your back?
(MR. D'ARC GRUNTING)
Mush! Mush! Come on, you huskies.
Oh, God!
(GUFFAWING)
- Hell of a journey.
- Michael.
- Snow like you wouldn't believe!
- Did you get everything?
I think so.
MR. D'ARC: What a day, though!
(CHATTERING)
- So, she's here?
- Upstairs.
Good.
You know, I never feel better
than when I'm up here.
As soon as I get 50 degrees north,
I feel good again.
Oh, man!
(BARKING)
I've reached an absolutely critical stage
on Pascal.
Hey, Nick, stoke up the fire.
First some skiing,
then off with the clothes and on with...
Daddy, I'm not going to go, okay?
I'm really tired.
- I hate it when Granny does this.
- MR. D'ARC: Let's hit the trail.
I'd love to.
I want to take Granny back, though.
Mikey and I'll take her.
I got some things I got to sort out,
anyway:
A little wild goose chase?
I would like to go with Michael
and I would like to go soon.
Communist,
I'll pray for you.
NICK: Simone's taking me to the
gas station. I'll see you in a while.
IRENKA: Come on, Gab!
- You ready?
- Hey!
Let's go for it.
- Will you be all right?
- Sure.
MR. D'ARC: Come on, Gabby!
- I'll take good care of her.
- GABBY: Okay.
IRENKA: Come on, Gab!
Granny!
Granny?
Granny! Granny!
Granny!
Granny!
(ECHOING) Granny!
(PARLEZ MOI D'AMOUR
PLAYING ON PHONOGRAPH)
What are you doing?
- My summer shoes.
- Yes.
I found them just like you said.
My wonderful shoes.
Keep them.
I don't need them for the winter.
Come on, you mustn't get cold again.
You don't believe in God, do you?
Not really.
GRANNY: It's a pity
because I think you are missing a lot.
I always thought that.
I thought I should tell you.
All I ever asked was
that they bury me in a well-pressed dress.
And you said to me
that you'd check for me,
and if there were even
the slightest wrinkle,
you'd straighten it.
That's what you promised.
You do remember?
Yes.
I do.
(PHONOGRAPH ENDS)
(WIND HOWLING)
(LEE AND MOLLY PLAYING ON STEREO)
There's more to know than you can see
Lee and Molly
White guy in love
NICK: You know, I've never been faithful
to anyone in my life.
I just told Irenka about someone
and she did not take it too well.
They had to go along
If there's trouble, I just feel trapped
and miserable and I just want to go.
"If you have to choose between grief
and nothing, you'd choose grief."
Know they can't bargain
- What's that got to do with anything?
- Just something William Faulkner said.
Yeah, well, fuck that.
This is me we're talking about.
I'd choose nothing.
Grief's fucked.
It's just depressing when these things end,
you know?
Lee and Molly
- There, that'll keep you warmer.
- Thank you.
How are you doing?
Just fine.
Christ, man, feel that.
Granny, you okay? Granny? Granny?
A little cold.
I got another jersey in my bag.
Okay, man, here we go.
(CAR HORN BLARING)
What are you doing?
Here you go.
Jesus Christ.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
I'm getting up front!
(CAR HORNS BLARING)
All right, hang on to the wheel!
Grab the wheel!
- Grab the fucking wheel!
- All right. I got the wheel.
- Take the wheel.
- All right, I got it.
- We got it.
- Granny!
We're going to be okay, man.
We're going to be okay.
- Fuck, man! Granny? Granny?
- We're going to get there.
NICK: We're gonna make it.
- A couple more blocks.
- MICHAEL: Come on, come on, Granny.
Granny?
Granny? Granny?
NICK: We're going to make it,
we're almost there.
Come on, Granny. We're almost there.
We're almost there, Granny.
Come on, Granny, stay with me!
Come on!
MICHAEL: Come on, Nick! Go, Nick!
Come on!
Come on, Granny!
- Let's bring her round, here.
- And support her head.
- Support her head. Come on.
- Grab her around there.
MICHAEL: You got her? You got her?
You got her? All right.
All right, let's go! Go! Open the door!
(BELLS TOLLING)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
It's okay. I'm going to go
with Nick and Irenka, all right?
Okay.
- I'm going to go with you guys.
- Good.
I'm not real good at this sort of thing.
You know, like after.
So, I'll just meet you back at the house,
okay?
(INDISTINCT)
I'm going to get in the car.
I don't really want to go right home.
- Okay.
- I don't know, I...
I feel old.
Let's go to my studio.
There's something I want to show you.
This is interesting.
- But that's not what I wanted to show you.
- What?
(MOANING)
(MOANING)
I like you a lot more
when you're not trying with me.
You only say that
because I'm going tomorrow.
Maybe.
People will always like you
when you least expect it.
Which is the most yourself.
Which is...
- Reassuring.
- Yeah.
You haven't had a very nice Christmas.
I'm sorry that this didn't work out.
- I'm not very good with things like this.
- Don't worry about it.
Gabby, there's something
I need to tell you.
GABBY: What?
It's about Irenka.
What about her?
Well...
- (STAMMERING) Something happened.
- What?
- What did you do?
- Nothing, really.
It's okay. I know.
You do?
- What?
- That you slept with her.
She told me she was going to
when we were in the country.
(CRACKLING)
(BEOWULF BARKING)
MICHAEL: Christmas morning
Irenka and Gabby were inseparable
Nick had gone, no one knew quite where
Someone else's Christmas Weird
MR. D'ARC: Michael, what a great gift.
That's really very thoughtful of you.
- Thanks. I'm glad you like it.
- Oh, yes. Thank you.
Do you think I'd look good in this?
Let's see... Sure.
This is going to look great on you.
- So, what did you get from your family?
- Oh, just some things.
But nothing like this.
When are you going to call them?
Simone, why don't you just
leave him alone?
Maybe he doesn't want to.
No, it's okay. I'm going to. I'm going to.
Excuse me.
I gave the picture to her.
GABBY: It's beautiful.
MICHAEL: So I left the house
and walked through the quiet streets
The only place I found open
was a flower stand
I guess maybe I took that as a sign
I decided to say goodbye to Granny
(WIND HOWLING)
WOMAN: Did you know her well?
No, I didn't.
I thought you knew her.
No.
I'm just a friend
of one of her granddaughters.
I'm nobody.
I met her once.
Twice.
I must be mistaken. I'm sorry, I...
I thought you were someone else.
No, wait.
I did know her.
I don't know why I didn't tell you.
I loved her.
But I don't know you.
Doesn't matter. You can go home now.
(CLOCK TICKING)
Oh.
Well, you'll have to excuse me.
I can't work with my clothes on.
I just want to get a glass of water.
Sit down, why don't you?
Please.
(CLOCK CHIMING)
So, how many of my daughters
have you slept with?
One?
Two?
Three?
Since I've been here?
- One.
- One?
Nearly three, but in the end, one.
What happens when you stay with people
for a long time?
They'd all end up dead or pregnant.
You know, I've worked on this book
for five years.
The Life and Work of Blaise Pascal:
The Definitive Biography
They'll fly me all over the world,
pay me money,
interview me on television,
all on one condition:
That I continue to convince them
I'm a genius.
Every sentence I write
has become a chase.
I keep thinking that somehow
I'll conjure up this dead man's essence.
I reach the bottom of the page, he's gone.
If anything, he's further away than ever.
Look at me.
A grown man without his clothes on!
It's silly.
There's gotta be another way.
I've been married to my wife for 27 years
and I don't understand her at all.
Not at all.
That's what I meant about my daughters.
It's the same with them,
just as ineffable, unknowable.
If you lived with them for 200 years,
you still wouldn't know them
My wife loved her mother very much
But she seems happier
now that she's dead
I've never seen her so happy
I don't understand that.
Do you?
- Granny was a remarkable woman.
- She hated me.
I would've loved her.
But she wouldn't have me.
She couldn't stand the intrusion.
I can still feel her power.
Then Father Walter saddles us with this.
You know, she was even more terrifying
when she was young.
Ridiculously certain in her judgments.
Simone will be just like her.
So, you're leaving us.
Yes, I'm going home.
MR. D'ARC: Mysteries.
Mysteries going on all the time,
every moment,
right under our noses
MICHAEL: Gabby told me
that she wasn't coming back to college
I'd miss her
But I knew it was for the best
By the end of that week,
I had come up with a new theory:
That all my theories were bullshit
I had been consistently wrong
There was no getting around that
What I came away with was the memory
of Granny sitting in the ruined chapel
under the winter sky,
surrounded by her past,
talking to me about God
(WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA)
Goodbye.
(SIGHING)
Don't look so sad.
(WOMAN CHATTERING IN FRENCH ON PA)
Goodbye, Mikey.
Goodbye, Gabby.
All right, now, don't wait for me.
I'm just going to go on through.
IRENKA: Come on.
(GIRLS LAUGHING)
MICHAEL: As I sat waiting for my plane,
I felt certain of one thing,
that wherever my journey took me,
I wouldn't go alone
WOMAN ON PA:
This is last call for Air Canada 55
