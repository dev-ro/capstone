Why didn't you warn me?
All my friends are dead.
My family was wiped out by this crazy town.
- Did you read Verna's letter?
- No.
Well, I asked you to, right?
Verna was very particular.
I'm sure she laid it all out.
But you knew about him.
You knew about this town.
You knew everything.
Oh, okay.
Okay, so who is he?
Well, the person in the basement
is Jedidiah Sawyer.
Goes by Jed.
He's your cousin.
For years I suspected something,
but I never knew for sure about Jed
until about four months ago when Verna,
who was very sick, presented him to me.
A grown man, huge, but mentally stunted.
With emotions of an eight-year-old.
Frankly, he scared the shit out of me.
Why'd she keep him?
Nobody loves you like your family, I guess.
She preserved you, too.
She investigated everyone
who was involved with the...
August 19th.
Found you right away.
And she let me live with those people?
You were safer there.
And she knew
there would always come a day.
Jed knows about you, too.
That was some welcome.
He doesn't know who you are.
And the last time a girl got away,
Jed lost his whole family.
So, he'll stay after you.
