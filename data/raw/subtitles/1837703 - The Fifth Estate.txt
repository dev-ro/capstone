to have to scroll down
for the Task Force 373 story.
Holger, I've got Nick.
Ah, great. Five minutes?
- We have to go.
- Five more minutes.
Yes, Bill, I know. But Nick
just spoke to Rosenbach.
They need at least
another few minutes.
No more delays, Alan.
You said twelve 0' clock.

You know the Germans.
They need to dot all the "I's"

Of course,
our top story this morning...
the White House
blasting the release
of over 90,000
U.S. military records.
It came from an organization
that didn't exist
five years ago, WikiLeaks.
The New York Times,
Britain's Guardian,
and Germany's Der Spiegel...
coordinated in publishing...
what some are comparing
to the Pentagon Papers,
back in the Nixon years.
MALE REPORTER 1: They include
civilian casualties
and special forces
killing squads.
The most serious allegation
is that some soldiers
committed war crimes.
BARACK OBAMA: I know
much has been written...
as a result
of the substantial leak
of documents from Afghanistan.
What is this website,
"WikiLeaks"?
And who is Julian Assange?
Assange has made WikiLeaks
a global force.
And for better or worse...
exposed what he considers
some of the world's
darkest secrets.

The eyes of the world
are on the Frontline Club

Julian Assange is a man

the life of the hunted...
changing his appearance,

there's nothing noble

Well, as our resident

could you please find out
who that someone is?
Whoever it was disguised
his IP address.
According to this, the print

It's thousands of pages.
You'll have to manually reboot

Daniel Berg. I volunteered

My associate Jay Lim sent in

I'll be back in a minute.
We didn't get anything
from Wikileakers.
"WikiLeaks."
Wiki-whatever.
This is ridiculous.
Who's in charge here?
DANIEL: Julian?
JULIAN: Huh?
It's Daniel. Daniel Berg.
-(SCOFFS)
- I contacted you over chat.
Daniel. Thank God.
I've got people waiting, here.
JULIAN: Can you help me
with this prick'?
His organization
is super cool.
They've been doing
crazy shit in Kenya.
The least you could do
is put us on your program.
The small conference rooms
are all booked.
What about the auditorium?
It's empty until the talk
about hacking video games.
(SIGHS) Okay, you can have
that for half an hour.
- Thank you.
- But nobody's gonna show up
unless you print some flyers.
Well, that shouldn't
be a problem.
Daniel...
God forbid
we give out free toner
to human rights activists.
(JULIAN GRUNTING)
Sorry.
I totally spaced out
on that proposal.
Mind you,
I was a bit busy in Nairobi.
Oh, by the way,
that report we leaked...
shifted voting 10%
in the presidential election.
You might want to mention that
when you introduce me.
Sure.
Shredded my power cord
in Mombasa.
I assume the club won't mind
making a small donation.
I'll pay for the cord if
you actually get it to work.
Well, when you're taking on
global corruption...
you need a few super powers.
(PRINTER WHIRRING)
El' voila'!
(BLOWS AIR)
I'm a mathematician
by training.
When I was a grad student
in Melbourne...
I became interested in...
MAN: Okay,
send us the camera now!
-...how...
- Excuse me, a little bit more!
(CLEARS THROAT) I became
interested in information...
MAN: Okay, switching!
...and how it ?ows
through society.
- And how...
-(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
when new information
comes to light,
it can bring about
great change.
(TUTS)
Excuse me.
Two people...
and a secret.
The beginning
of any conspiracy
and of all corruption.
MAN: Otto...
- Otto, what is he doing?
- And as it grows...
...more lies, deceits.
More people...
and more secrets.
But...
if we can find
one moral man...
one whistleblower...
Someone willing to expose
all these secrets.
That man could topple the most
repressive of regimes.
What the hell?
Otto, my talk
is in 10 minutes!
And there's the problem.
He just ruined
my entire presentation!
Retribution.
Whistleblowers are afraid
to come forward
because they fear retribution.
But what if we could
remove that fear'?
Twenty years ago,
I bought my first modem
and joined a legion.
Cypherpunks, fighting
for freedom, for privacy...
for the right to remain
concealed in clouds of code.
Today's hackers
take it for granted,
but they surf the Internet...
because of the programs
we created to hide data...
to... to hide our identities.
Even then,
I knew this technology...
could hold the key to a whole
new form of social justice.
Hundreds of volunteers work
on the documents we are sent.
But we've honed
our technology...
to a point that
even I don't know
the identity of our sources.
And if the whistleblower's
identity is secret...
then he has nothing to fear.
As Oscar Wilde said...
"Give a man a mask, and
he will tell you the truth."
Sorry, it's going to be
a few minutes.
We had some
technical difficulties.
Good talk, huh?
You think so?
People anonymously
sharing secrets...
I mean, isn't that why
we tore down the Wall?
Believe me, no one
is interested in your secrets.
Yours, on the other hand...
It was great. It's a shame
the turnout wasn't better.
One convert at a time.
By the way, I can soup up
the graphics if you want.
What's wrong with
the ones I've got'?
Nothing.
I'm sure they would have
blown people away in the '80s.
DANIEL: Hey...
do you want to check out
the talk on microcontrollers?
The guy who invented TV-B-Gone
is speaking.
It's a remote. You walk
into a bar and turn off...
all the TVs.
Don't you get bored
spending your time
with all these wankers?
Building antennae
out of Pringles packets...
reading Neuromancer
and playing Call of Cthulhu.
What a waste!
Capable generous men,
men of purpose.
That's what the world needs.
All this?

It's not what we fought for.
(SCOFFS) Shit. Come on.
(WOMAN WHOOPS)
Hurry up, Daniel.
(PEOPLE WHOOPING)
DANIEL: Where are we going?
JULIAN: (PANTS) To church.
A government
destroyed by tyranny...
rebuilt under a glass dome
so the whole world
could look in.
There's an ideal to aspire to.
Just look at it, Daniel.
Risen from the ashes.
A whole city,
once ruled by fascists,
now overrun by artists,
by anarchists...
-and crows and snowstorms...
-(CHUCKLES)
and transparency.
My father took me to the dome
when they first built it.
I was 13.
He wasn't quite so eloquent.
Yeah, well, when I was 13,
my mum started
dating this guy...
from a nasty Australian cult
called The Family.
They believed in blue auras
and cleansing souls...
and the strict discipline
of children.
Severe beatings...
starvation diets...
regular closings
of psychiatric drugs.
My mum knew
the guy was a wanker...
but by the time
she came to her senses
they had a kid together and...
We spent the next three years
on the run.
They chased us
all over the country.
That's terrifying.
Why do you think
my hair is white?
Come on.
I want to show you something.
DANIEL:
It's called the Tacheles.
It's an artists' squat.
They were going to tear it
down in the '90s...
but some painters occupied it.
J U LIAN: Cool.
Listen, I better get to work.

So what are you working on?
Look, today was cool,
but these are
sensitive documents.
People's lives are at stake.
You can trust me.
JULIAN: Yes, and quiet.
There's a new leak
on the submission platform.
In my twenties, I created
a tool called Rubberhose.
It hid sensitive information
beneath layers and layers
of fake data.
WikiLeaks is based
on the same idea.
Take any message.
"Are you safe?"
"Are you safe?"
(VOICES OVERLAPPING)
J U LIAN: We constantly upload
fake data from fake sources...
to make it impossible
to monitor our real sources.
And their very presence
is infinitely deniable.
The system makes
leaks untraceable.
They simply turn up
on the submission platform.
Ever heard of Julius Baer?
DANIEL: It's a big
Swiss Bank, right?
JULIAN: Huge.
Manages 400 billion dollars
for the ultra-rich.
It uses offshore secrecy laws
to hide money for fat cats...

What? Did you think
we just threw what we got up

No, but...
you're just giving me

make it impossible...
for the bank to put the genie
back in the bottle.
Of course,
we're happy that the EFF

has already ruled
in our favor.

he'll blast the LISTSERV.
Yeah, no.
But, with an organization

They were in the documents.
Yes, but why not cut them out?
They have families, children.

KNN NEWS ANCHOR: The victims,
Oscar Kamau Kingara
and John Paul Oulu...
had worked closely with
the Kenyan Commission
on Human Rights...
on a report
documenting complicity
of the Kenyan Police
in over 400 murders.
The report gained notoriety
after it was published
on the WikiLeaks site.
It can't be just some
mealy-mouthed press release.
Kibaki had them murdered.
The language needs
to be stronger.
- It's already quite strong.
- Give me the damn computer.
They left their names
in the report.
They wanted the world to know
they stood behind it.
Yes, they wanted
the world to know.
It was a damn fine story.
We put it on the front
of the website...
and we couldn't even
get a single paper
outside of Kenya
to pick it up.
We're not breaking through.
Those were my friends.
If we had publicized
the report better...
then...
they would have been heroes.
And there would be too high
a political cost
to murdering them.
Kibaki wouldn't have dared.
(SNIFFLES)
He's a tyrant, Julian.
I don't think more publicity
would have...
Oh, what the hell do you know
about publicity?
I mean, outside of sucking up
to reporters. It's disgusting.
The woman from WIRED?
I was selling her a story.
Yeah, well, why don't you just
leave that to me?
MARCUS: Don't take it
personally. He's just scared.
You should be, too.
Our operating system
is secure,
our other sources are safe,
we're fine.
Really.
What?
Do you think our site
is vulnerable?
I think you're taking on
presidents, kings, kingpins.
People that can easily afford
the kind of black hats...
that get off on breaking into
a "secure" operating system.
And believe me,
if your OS is anything
less than secure...
it's not gonna take them long
to identify the rest
of the sources...
and to hunt them down.

if I sent you to Cairo,

The President is busting
my nuts about this UN speech.
Turn on CNN.
WikiLeaks will not say if the source
was in government,
law enforcement...
industry,
or is a private citizen
with the capability
to intercept messages.
Privacy experts
are not pleased
to see personal
communications released...
and even less pleased
that they were collected...
and then stored
for these eight long years.
At 8:45, the first plane
hit the World Trade Center.
By 8:50, the first texts
indicating something is wrong.
WikiLeaks says it has verified
some of the texts...
and believes
they all are authentic.
These are the guys
that skewered Palin?
And the Iranian
nuclear program,
Petroperú,
Bank Julius Bär.
Right, we just indicted
the bankers.
Do they have an agenda?
Truth, justice,

Who has the capacity to track
that many pager services?

came from us?

they have a man on it.

we get the Pentagon involved.

always so trigger-happy?
It's just a website, right?
It's not a terrorist cell.
Why don't I call Justice?
Justice will tell you there's
a First Amendment issue.
And even if there weren't...
this site has mirrors outside
the U.S. It's beyond the law.
I don't even know

It means that the transfer

It gets better.
"Daniel Schmitt,
he won't give his real name.
"No, instead, he adopted

I spent weeks reading Horace

(WIND BLOWING)
I've heard people say
that I dangle on the autistic

It's probably why I lean
so heavily on those around me.
Yeah.
We need to set up
a media launch.
Yeah.
Ziggy is planning something
at the Parliament building.
Ziggy?
- Mmm-hmm.
You want to launch the
biggest leak we've ever had
in Iceland?
Let's take the fight to them.
Courage is contagious.
Right?
JULIAN: The video shows
the brutal slaughter
of two Reuters reporters.
Here, we have
firsthand evidence
of the barbarity of war.
A man, going to drop
his children at school...
sees another man bleeding
to death on the pavement.
He stops to aid this civilian
and in the process is killed.
And his vehicle
turned 180 degrees...
by the sheer force
of the Apache helicopter's
30-millimeter bullets...
ripping into the side
of the vehicle...
miraculously not killing
the two children inside.
The website is calling
this "Collateral Murder."
Captain Nash,
is that a fair description
of the job our troops
are doing?
If you are embedding with
terrorists in a combat zone...
and those terrorists get
engaged and you get killed,
it is not murder.

if you don't want
ugly pictures,
you should stay out

Twelve million people have
seen that video on YouTube.
Do you still want to tell me
you think it's just
a little website?
General Thomason
is reviewing intel.
I told him to pull you in.
I'm on in five,
do you have anything for me?
The guy on Fox is pretty good.
Maybe you should use
some of his material.
(SCOFFS)
Sam.
This is Jim.
Just tell them the truth.
The soldiers
were following protocol.
This is computer geeks looking
at the war through a pinhole.
Well, these computer geeks
are starting
to become a real nuisance,
Jim.
Welcome to the revolution.

(DOOR OPENS)
JULIAN: "Assange,
disheveled like a bag lady
"walking in off the street...
"He smelled as if
he hadn't bathed...
"Changes cell phones daily."
I mean...
A couple of days
of serious analysis...
and then it's just all about
how weird I am.
(CHUCKLES) You must have
enjoyed Keller's diatribe
on your filthy white socks.
Yes, but I hadn't figured...
that, you know,
brutal slaughter
and the state of my socks...
would get equal billing
in The New York Times.

Hello.

Ziggy-
Christ, they're gonna kill us.
Get off Skype.
Get off everything, now.
MAN: Turn the phones off!
(COMPUTER BEEPING)
Guys, we're going
to have to shut down
everything right now.
You all have
five seconds to save.
- Five seconds!
- What's going on, Marcus?
We cannot let them trace us.
I just spoke to Kim Zetter.
She said the U.S. Military
arrested a private
for leaking secrets to us.
The video?
This is the guy
who leaked the video?
BIRGITTA: She said
it was more than that.
Half a million classified
U.S. Army documents
and hundreds of thousands...
of internal communiqués from
the U.S. State Department.
This is the biggest leak
of classified information
in history.
(COMPUTERS CHIMING)
Oh, my God.
You're telling me
that this private
stuck a thumb drive
in a computer?
It was a CD.
- Excuse me?
- It was a blank CD.
It was marked "Lady Gaga."
- SAM: Where's the Secretary?
- Jim's calling her now.
Do we know which documents
Manning leaked'?
He's refusing to talk.
We think it's war logs
from Afghanistan and Iraq.
And cables
from the NCD database.
Which cables?
Which cables?
He may have leaked
the whole database.
That's a quarter
of a million cables.
(SCOFFS)
They can read like
the diary of a 12-year-old.
You know, personal,
frank, rude comments...
about every president
and prime minister alive.
This is a diplomatic
nightmare.
Excuse me,
but who gives a shit
about diplomacy right now?
The military logs expose
hundreds of informants.
There are lives at risk.
Sam, he's right.
A 22-year-old private
with a history
of mental instability...
and a Lady Gaga CD...
and we're on the verge of
a major international crisis.
MARCUS: He bragged about it
in a chat room.
What the hell was he thinking?
He's a kid. He's 22.
Are you sure
they can't trace us?
I'm adding
another Tor circuit.
Wipe my portion
from the hard drive.
Well, if you have them,
then they know about it.
I know. I got to go.
(PHONES BEEP)
(SIGHS)
- Are we back up yet'?
- Just a few more proxies.
The whole mission
is to protect sources.
We can't protect them
from themselves.
We're online.
See if Julian's on chat.
(FLIGHT STEWARDESS SPEAKING
IN DUTCH OVER PA)
Shit! He's got them.
How did he not tell us?
That is three gigs of text.
This is crazy.
Tell him
we can't dump the data.
It's too dangerous. Tell him!

We need time
to go through it all.

Guys, look at this.
Julian Assange
is engaged in terrorism.
He should be treated
as an enemy combatant.
WikiLeaks should be
closed down
permanently and decisively.
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)
Nick, how can I help you?
Can you put me
in touch with Julian?
Julian's not available.
Daniel,
we both know you're sitting
on the biggest story
on the planet right now.
And if you're thinking
of going to ground on this,
it's too late.
The cat's out of the bag.
Bradley Manning's
future and yours
depend on how this
material is handled.
Now, I want you to tell Julian
I'm already working
on a story...
to paint this as the next
Pentagon Papers.
But you need our help.
It's the biggest thing
you've ever done.
And if you think they spun you
on the Collateral
Murder video...
wait till you see
what they do here.
Tell Julian
this is all about survival.
- I'll get back to you.
-(PHONE BEEPS)
Where's Julian flying in to?
Julian.
Did anyone follow you?
No, no, no, I don't think so.
What's he doing here?
- I told you to come alone.
- You need to hear him out.
They're looking for us, and
they got people everywhere.
JULIAN: Daniel Ellsberg
put out a statement.
He said
they're coming after us.
We need to publish now.
It's hundreds of thousands of
pages of sensitive material.
It's not like the video.
The docs are full of jargon,
they're totally impenetrable.
We wouldn't know what the hell
we were publishing.
So, we let
the historians decide.
I thought the whole point
of this organization
was to publish in full.
I thought the point
was protecting whistleblowers.
(MAN ANNOUNCING OVER PA)
Can I speak to Nick Davies,
please?
NICK: Don't get me wrong.
You should still
keep an eye out
for men with poison umbrellas.
But if the U.S.
has any foresight,
they know they need
to do more...
than kill you.
They need to delegitimize
everything you stand for.
You represent
a terrifying future.
Right now, the most
powerful media machine
on the entire planet...
is planning a smear campaign
like nothing you've ever seen.
(SCOFFS)
Amazing how someone
could talk for 10 minutes
without actually
saying anything.
You said
you would hear him out.
What are you proposing?
An international
media coalition
legitimizing you
as a news organization.
Let the U.S. attack.
We print the news.
And if we put you on
the moral high ground...
with Mother Teresa,
with Nelson Mandela...
No one will be able
to fuck with us.
But they'd still get
their exclusives.
Look, finding stories
in all these documents...
that's a lot of work,
it's a lot of time.
You can't expect us to do it
without an incentive.
And then what? We set a date?
You run your stories,
we post the raw data.
Obviously, all these documents
have names,
sources, U.S. informants.
You'll need to redact them.
But WikiLeaks doesn't edit.
That's all very well,
but The Guardian
cam be seen to condone...
publishing something
that puts lives in danger.
And morals aside, it's about
how you're perceived.
(SIGHS)
You're starting
an information war
with the United States
Government.
You mustn't hand
them ammunition.
I suppose
it is just a name search.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Well, look, that's my editor.
What should I say?
How secure are your phones?
(CONTINUES RINGING)
Alan.
So, do we have a deal?
No, no, no,
it's a complete cock-up.
He won't talk to me.
Let me talk to him, then.
I can't.
Listen, I'll get back to you.
Julian...
this kind of coverage
gets people's attention.
It could be the culmination
of everything we've done.
JULIAN: This is a code
to a temporary site.
I'll send you the link
in 24 hours.
You'll find
the war logs there.
So, it's a deal?
We publish, you publish.
We redact, you redact.
We'll put out the war logs
in six weeks.
If you behave,
we'll move on to the cables.
Great.
ALAN:
Well, a coalition government
will have a certain
honeymoon period.
But, selling off the
post office'? I mean that...
Good morning, everyone.
The meeting is over.
Alan, I'm sorry. I told Nick.
Get me Bill Keller
at The Times,
and what's-his-fuck
at Der Spiegel.
Alan?
I'm sorry, folks, we're gonna
have to break this up.
(COMPUTER BEEPS)
Door? Yeah.
(SIGHS)
He's pretty slow for a tech wizard.
He said it's 91,000 logs
from Afghanistan alone.
I imagine
that might take a second.
(COMPUTER CHIMES)
All right, here we go.
Look at that.
Keren, get me Bill Keller
at The New York Times.
And let's be discreet.
HOLGER:
The spreadsheet is enormous.
I'm sure it contains
the scoop of the century...
but we simply
cannot access it.
Are you working in Excel?
Every time I open the damn
thing the system crashes.
You have to parse the data
in a text editor...
and then script it into
a searchable database.
- MARCEL: Are you getting this?
- Yeah, that helps.
I blew off a profile
with McChrystal in Kabul.
This better be good.
Do you know what
"E.O.F." stands for?
It's "Escalation of Force."
Can you see that?
Yeah, got it.
E.O.F. is
"Escalation of Force."
Which I believe
means more dead civilians.
The Espionage Act?
You can't be serious.
If the Attorney General
can show...
he tried to convince a source
to leak
classified information...
You mean like every journalist
who's ever covered
the Pentagon'?
They could indict us
under that rubric.
I wouldn't be surprised
if they do.
Nothing draws people
to a cause
like a celebrity martyr, Alan.
IAN: That's good, Daniel.
Uh, look...
can you email a list
of whistleblower prizes
you're putting Manning up for?
No emailing.
But I can fax you.
Right, of course.
But we need it by Friday
so we can run it in his bio.
Will do. Thanks, Ian.
HOLGER: And this
Task Force 373 has a hit list
with more than 2,000 names.
MARCEL: Yes, they refer to it
as "stopping birthdays."
These civilian casualty
numbers are devastating.
It's a shit show.
I've got
the U.K. ambassador saying
the campaign isn't under
proper supervision.
(PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
HOLGER: Do you want to talk
to Marcel? Hold on.
(INDISTINCT TALKING CONTINUES)
Well, you can sleep
here if you want.
No, no.
T-minus four.
Are you getting excited?
Sure.
He must be exhausted.
I mean,
the redactions alone...
it shouldn't take that long.
It's just a name search.
That's what
we initially thought.
But a lot of it is context.
Nick told Julian...
a tip from the "goat herder
in the red house,"
in small villages...
that's as damning as a name.
We're only posting
a few hundred of the logs
and we're swimming.
You'd need an army
to go through all 91,000.
Thank God you have one.
The story on the generals
would typically be the lead...
but everything's
going out at once
in case there's a gag order.
We're struggling to keep it
to 14 pages.
It's talking points
for the morning interviews.
- Julian.
- What the hell?
I've been trying
to reach you for hours.
I was just sending you a list.
The URLs need
to be standardized,
torrents need seeding.
We need to...
The redactions.
That was on my list.
DANIEL: It's 91,000 documents,
and our site is publishing
in four days.
JULIAN: Let's go.
DANIEL: What the hell
were you thinking?
JULIAN: Editing reflects bias.
We make a promise to our
sources to publish in full.
You lied to everyone we're
working with. You lied to me.
It's funny, you know, I don't
remember you objecting...
to us publishing the names
and addresses
-of every BNP member.
- This is different.
These sources are fighting
for the very thing
we're supposed to stand for.
And remind me what that is,
exactly. Hmm?
Transparency for
powerful organizations...
exposing corruption and
conspiracy wherever it exists.
We're going to have
to push back publication.
There's no way we can release
in four days.
Fourteen pages
in The Guardian,
twelve in The New York Times.
This is more coverage
than all the leaks
we have had, combined.
We are winning
an information war...
which goes beyond
any short-term alliance
we have with
the mainstream media...
and you want to throw it
all away because you fear...
that some U.S. Government
informant might come to harm?
These are human beings,
Julian,
and their lives are at stake.
What about the lives
of the soldiers...
and the civilians
involved in these conflicts?
Death squads, unreported
civilian casualties,
countless incidents
of friendly fire.
This is information
the world needs to know.
So, the next time you find
yourself lecturing me
about this organization...
please try to remember
why I created it.
And why I hired
you to help me.
(SCOFFS)
Well, that's funny.
I don't remember
you hiring me.
I don't recall
a contract or a salary.
But I guess I should have
known when I met Jay Lim.
There is no organization.
There's just you
and your ego...
and the lies you tell to get
whatever the fuck you want.
(SIGHS)
You know, it's incredible...
how much time you can spend
with a person...
and still have no idea
who they are.
You're suspended.
Effective immediately.
MARCEL: (OVER PHONE) Those are
the most revealing docs.
Do whatever you can
to keep them off the site.
Okay, thank you, Marcel. Bye.
Rosenbach said the bulk
of the identifiable sources...
are in the threat assessments.
It's 14,000 documents.
But, if you hold those,
there are a lot
fewer names in the rest.
Yeah, I got it.
(COMPUTER CHIMES)
DANIEL: And remember,
don't tell Julian
that we were talking.
Are you seeing
the ridiculous crap
he's spouting on the chat?
MARCUS: Danny, he's completely
out of his mind.
And if he keeps doing this,
we're going to have to quit.
All of us.
Just take care
of the documents, okay?
ANKE: Daniel,
have you seen this?
(SIGHS) He's on Twitter.
He says that you are FBI,
and that I'm CIA.
Look.
This is crazy.
NICK: Der Spiegel is begging
for more time.
The Times wants to go.
Holger, I've got Nick.
Ah, great. Five minutes?
- We have to go.
- Five more minutes.
ERICA HILL: (ON TV)
Our top story this morning...
the White House,
blasting the release
of over 90,000
U.S. military records.
They tell a story
that some veterans
of the region know full well.
More civilian deaths
than are ever reported.
Unexplained American deaths,
questionable
battlefield tactics.
The leak has forced
the White House
to defend its Afghan strategy.
Open and transparent
government...
is something that
the President believes
is truly important...
but the stealing
of classified information
and its dissemination
is a crime.
The United States
strongly condemns...
the illegal disclosure
of classified information.
What's worse
for national security?
WikiLeaks or bad U.S. policy?
MALE REPORTER 1:
Following the release
of the Afghan war logs...
WikiLeaks announced
it is sitting
on over 250,000
U.S. diplomatic cables...
and plans to release
them shortly.
(PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
I've got a source in Colombia
we're gonna have to extract.
Christ,
Putin's gonna go ballistic.
How many more sources
do we have to notify
in the Middle East?
We're still trying to reach
our contacts in Tehran.
Okay, good. Keep it up.
I just talked to Libya,
they have real concerns
about the ambassador.
We're pulling the ambassador.
All right,
everybody, listen up!
I need at least 10 names...
of high priority sources
who could be harmed...
if and when these cables
are put out.
If we can claim that Assange
has blood on his hands...
we can turn this thing around.
Hi.
Do you think the President
of Turkmenistan...
will be more upset that
I called him
a practiced liar...
or that I called him vain?
- I'm sure he's heard worse.
- Hmm.
"President Berdymukhammedov
does not like people
"smarter than him.
"Since he's not very bright,
"he's suspicious
of a lot of people."
Well, he's been around
for a long time.
I don't think he's worried
about the opinions
of a mid-level foreign attaché
That's why I signed
Hillary's name to it.
I'll see if The Times
will hold it.
No, I've got bigger issues.
No, Sarah,
I am collecting cables
from the head
of every foreign desk.
Okay, you tell me...
You tell me, then,
(STAMMERS) what do I ignore?
This?
This destroys
the Sudanese peace talks,
this screws a source
in Amman...
The Times will redact
the names.
Yeah, but,
what about him, will he?
And don't you tell me
that your friend Keller's
got him under control.
He's bigger than The Times.
He can do whatever
the hell he wants.
Just like he did
with the war logs.
(SIGHS) God.
Any word from Tarek?
SARAH: He's named in at least
a half a dozen of these.
JAMES: Let's bring him in.

SAM: (ON TV)
There are names, operations.
This leak puts
Americans' lives,
and our allies' lives at risk.
There is blood on their hands.
Pentagon officials
are saying today
that this has been
their fear all along.
That, if those names
were revealed,
those people would
become targets.
MIKE MULLEN: Mr. Assange
can say whatever he likes...
about the greater good
he thinks
he and his source are doing...
but they might already
have on their hands
the blood of some
young soldier...
or that of an Afghan family.
FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR:
For more, we're joined here
in our New York studio
by Daniel Ellsberg.
DANIEL ELLSBERG: In terms
of "blood on their hands"...
I'm sorry to say
a lot of actual blood
has been spilled...
as opposed to this
hypothetical blood.
HEATHER BROOKE". This is
all speculative harm...
and what's not being talked
about is the actual harm...
and that's what has been
exposed through this leak.
So, I think that's important
for us to think about.
At least he kept part
of the bargain.
250,000 diplomatic cables,
right here.
Amazing.
So, the bugger came through.
Nick was right. It's huge.
It's a window into every
government on the planet.
Already I've got
a dozen page ones.
Gaddafi lying to his people,
Putin arming
Georgian separatists.
Damning assessments of leaders
in Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia.
Are you still focused
on yesterday's news?
On the high priest
of truth bragging
about a redaction process
that didn't exist?
I wouldn't call that
yesterday's news.
Sorry, wasn't he your messiah?
Yes. Yes.
Just like the rest of them.
Feet of clay.
So he's a liar,
a callous little zealot,
just like every
other oddball source.
NICK: Mmm.
Seventeen little keystrokes,
and anyone in the world
can read what he publishes.
And now we've given him
a bloody megaphone, they will.
He's not a source.
He's the head
of a huge media empire
that's accountable to no one.
And we put him there.

(GASPS)
(SNIFFLES) You're safe.
What do we do now?
Where do we go?
JULIAN: We have tried hard
to make sure...
(CLEARS THROAT) that this
material does not bring
innocents to harm.
We're familiar with groups
whose abuses we exposed...
- Did you reach him?
- No.
If we both plug in.
We should be able to do it
while he's speaking.
We have a harm
minimization process.
We don't do things
in an ad hoc way.
All the material is over
seven months old...
Daniel, we both know he's
never going to step aside.
He can't be trusted.
We need to shut him down.
If you want to do this,
we have to do it now.
JULIAN:
...whose abuses we exposed...
is attempting to criticize
the messenger, to detract...
It takes two things
to change the world...
and you'd be surprised how
many people have good ideas.
But...
commitment, true commitment...
it requires sacrifice.
Good journalism
exposes powerful abusers...
so that often leads
to backlashes, but...
revolution is...
the struggle
between the past...
and the future.
And the future has just begun.
(INAUDIBLE)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
I guess that
Turkmenistan comment
didn't go over too well
with the Secretary, did it?
Actually,
Berdymukhammedov himself
called for
my early retirement.
I'm sure he called for
a lot more than that.
But there's diplomacy for you.
Well,
let's drink to diplomacy.
(CHUCKLES)
- At least while we still can.
-(SIGHS)
Okay-
You know, I was...
I was watching him
give an interview
while I was packing up.
He was talking
about all the leaks
he'd put out in the last
six months alone...
and I started thinking.
Two advanced degrees,
a Fulbright.
Five diplomatic posts,
14 years abroad.
All those nights,
I stayed up worrying...
if the slightest turn
of phrase
would send the whole world
to hell in a hand basket.
And right now,
at this very moment...
I don't know which one of us
history is gonna judge
more harshly.
- MALE REPORTER: Julian!

It's disabled.
Completely.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
No one will be able to submit.
(CHILDREN LAUGHING)
DANIEL:
You know, he dyes his hair.
I saw it once.
We were at a conference,
and he went up
to the hotel room.
The cult he was in,
The Family...
they made the kids
dye their hair white.
I guess everyone has secrets.
Scars.
Moments in time
that shape them.
-(BOTH SNICKER)
- Some we can get past.
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
Some we can't.
There was a moment
when everything was possible.
We changed the world.
He changed the world.
But then he made it
all about him.
It always was.
Only someone so obsessed
with his own secrets...
could have come up with a way
to reveal everyone else's.
(SCOFFS)
You know, there was a time
when British papers...
couldn't report
on parliamentary debate.
But then a few
very brave men...
started printing pamphlets
and leaking these debates.
And, uh, well,
I believe the men were hanged.
But the public
saw these pamphlets,
and demanded access...
and the modern
fourth estate was born...
from the passion
and the vision...
of these few brave souls.
Who were hanged.
Who were hanged.
(CHUCKLES)
And now, we find ourselves
in the same position.
A new information
revolution...
infinitely more powerful
than the last.
A fifth estate...
seemingly hell-bent on
destroying its predecessors.
All the old models,
dying faster
than the new can replace them.
Which is why we need
more brave souls.
You and Julian
have charted a course
through all this chaos...
pointed at the truth.
And yes...
the tyrants of this world
should beware.

NICK: Knowing that now,
we have the power
to demand the information
that one day soon...
will wash them all away.
(CHUCKLES)
How's that?
So, where should we start?
Well, most good stories
start at the beginning.
PROTESTERS: (CHANTING)
Free Julian Assange!
Free Julian Assange!
JULIAN: There is no proof...
that anyone came to any harm
as a result
of the full disclosure...
of the unredacted documents
published on
the WikiLeaks website.
Not one shred of evidence.
We're taking on large,
powerful groups...
with vast and powerful lobbies
to protect them.
So, of course,
we're going to be attacked
in all sorts of manners.
My goodness.
Well, I know the mainstream
media is biased...
but this is absurd.
These allegations
are without basis...
and their issue
is deeply disturbing.
As an organization, of course
of course we, uh,
have made mistakes.
Um...
Uh... There are perhaps
a number of individuals...
An individual, perhaps,
that we should not
have employed.
Um...
That is possibly
the greatest mistake.
A WikiLeaks movie?
Which one?
Oh, that one. Mmm.
Well, that one is based on
the two worst books...
full of lies and distortion,
like all bad propaganda.
Look, urn...
A WikiLeaks movie...
It's more like
the "anti-WikiLeaks" movie.
If you want to know
the truth...
no one is going
to tell you the truth.
They're only going
to tell you their version.
So, if you want the truth...
you have to seek it out
for yourself.
In fact, that's where
the real power lies...
in your willingness
to look beyond this story...
any story.
And as long
as you keep searching,
you are dangerous to them.
That's what
they're afraid of. You.
It's all about you.
(CHUCKLES)
And a little bit
about me, too.
