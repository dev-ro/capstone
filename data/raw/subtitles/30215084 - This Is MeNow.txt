Have you ever heard the story
of Alida and Taroo?
It's an old Puerto Rican myth
about star-crossed lovers
from two warring Taíno tribes.
They tried to hide
their romance.
But their love
shined too bright.
Alida's father found
out and, furious,
ordered her to marry another.
Heartbroken,
Alida turned to the gods
to save her from this fate.
So they turned her
into a red flower.
Taroo found out and sank
into a deep despair.
He begged the gods
to help him find her.
So they turned him
into a hummingbird.
Now it is said, whenever
you see a hummingbird,
flitting from flower to flower,
it is Taroo,
searching for his true love.
My mother must've told me
that story a thousand times.
So when I was a little girl,
whenever someone asked me what
I wanted to be when I grew up,
my answer was always
in love.
I wanna be in love.
But I learned the hard way not all
love stories have a happy ending.
Friends, we've become a
disconnected, survivalist,
spiritually, mentally
broken animal.
A Furby suit of humanity.
All we do is slap sexy
graphics and theme songs
on videos of people being
assholes to one another.
We have no love for each other.
We have no love for ourselves.

Love is dying.
You know how much I love you.
So that's when the dream
started, you think?
With that heartbreak?
Yeah.
Think so.
I-I had never felt
anything like that before.
Honestly, I thought
I was gonna die.
These dreams, though.
Hearts, flowers, hummingbirds.
Zodiac fantasies.
You're such a Taurus.
What sign is your wife?
We're not here to talk about me.
Come on.
Leo.
You guys fight a lot, right?
Let's get back to you.
What about the new guy?
Well.
My friend Mike hates him.
The cynic?
People don't fall
in love like that.
- Her heart just got crushed.
- "thank you, next".
And what if this
guy's "the one"?
Not gonna lie, this
new guy is pretty fine.
Caught up with the bullshit
and the fairy tales.
Maybe your friends are
just trying to protect you.
What do you think?
Is it too soon?
In 2012,
the number one question
people asked was what is love?
As of today, the top
ten questions are
what should I watch?
Where my refund?
How you like me now?
Why women kill?
Will I get laid?
Is Europe a country?
How I screenshot a Mac?
Am I preg-erant?
And why my poop green?
What you're looking
for is not out there.
The signs say we're a match.
That's you.
Libra.
And?
And...
Your meticulousness
keeps me focused.
I'm meticulous?
Yeah. You know, you
you can be particular.
Why do you listen to that crap?
Baby, what?
It's a compliment.
It just means that you
like everything perfect.
Perfect?
- Why do you... Ouch!
- Hey! Is this perfect?
- Is this perfect, huh?
- It's too... Stop!
Stop what?
Huh?
Damn. Why do you
always make me do this?

Fuck Libras. Libras.
I don't get it.
Libra and Leo are supposed
to work. It's a thing.
No, nobody likes a drunk boy.
What's with her and
all the bad boys?
Could be daddy issues.
I think I can see my
father's house from here.
Mm.
She's smart. She's,
she's beautiful.
And she seems so strong.
Why does she always need
to be with somebody?
- She's still searching.
- Mm-hmm.
She needs some stability after
all that emotional whiplash.
Oh, it's a damn shame.
Yeah, makes me super sad.
I just wanna giver
her a big hug.
Mm-hmm.
We're sending her all the signs.
She just can't see what they mean.
It's no surprise.
Humans are self-sufficient.
Their technology has
rendered us obsolete.
Speak for yourself.
Let's not give ourselves
too much credit.
We are the Zodiacal Council.
But the stars hold
all the power.
The stars can speak their minds,
but what is in the deepest
recesses of you heart...
Is ultimately what
will manifest itself.
Sometimes I chew my hair.
Same!
You know what?
You would look hot in bangs.
Leo, always shooting your shot.
If it could just get
quiet for a while.
Be still.
Let her get out
there and explore.
- Hmm.
- Yeah.
She'll learn.
What is she doing?
She is a glutton
for punishment.
Oh, no. No. No, no,
no. It's too soon!
Will you marry me?
Till death do us part.
Till death do us part.
I told you she
couldn't be alone.
You may now kiss the bride.

She doesn't listen.
You know, she thinks
I'm her employee.
All she cares about
is work, okay?
When she's not working, she's
trying to find more work.
Add in the defensiveness
and constant criticism.
I apologized a million times...
It's never enough for you.
Can't you just be happy?
I just, I feel like I'm
another thing in her house.

Boundaries, bro.
I hate that I can't

It's like a Vanderpump Rules marathon
and it's four in the morning,
and I stop judging them
and I start judging myself.
Love that show.
The reunion?
Oh! Messy.
That was not cute.
She just can't see
what's most important.
She runs right through them
like she's a man-eater,
but that's not what's happening.
That's not who she is.
Is that what
they're calling her?
Oh, worse than that.
That's so shady. They
got nothing better to do.
She is bound to go in circles
unless she rises...
Above her physical self.
Yeah! She gotta rise up.
I'ma need a "get right".
Know what I'm saying?
- The journey is within.
- She gotta look in the mirror.
But why can't we help
her just a little bit?
- Yeah?
- No.
- Definitely not.
- No.
- No!
- Hell no.
Yeah, no, I meant no.
She's gotta come out of
that dark room on her own.
You must respect the ebb
and flow of the universe.
Right.
We can't intervene.
We can't.
That's what friends are for.

- She fell afterwards.
Right. Right.

guys doing here?
Is it my birthday?
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you. No.

Why don't you just sit down?
Why don't you leave?
What are you doing here in
my house? Who let you in?
- Maybe we should...
- Uh, no,
- oh, my God, no.
- Yes.
Enough with the eggshells.
It's an intervention.
We are here because...
Because we care about you.
Shit, um...
- I'm sorry.
- Should I go?
- I should go.
- No!
- I'm gonna go.

Absolutely, you should go.

No.

Oh! No.

- No, you don't.

- Love?
All right, let's
get this over with.
Are you serious with this guy?
God. We're just having fun.
- We see all the signs.
- Like what?
Like, you're out partying
on a random Tuesday.
That's not a sign.
I know my signs.
Okay, that's not
what this is about.
- What is it about?
- It's about you.
About your need to
be in a relationship.
My God, we are just having fun!
It's like, "I love you, babe."
And I'm like, "I love you
too, babe." And that's it.
We're not serious.
We're not serious.
We think you might
be a sex addict.
What?
- Oh, God. Come on.
- Maybe.
I'm the most monogamous
one out of all of us.
You are a relationship addict,
running from one
relationship to the next.
Okay.
You have a problem.
I have a problem?
You haven't been in a relationship
since the sixth grade.
You go from random
hookup to random hookup
so you don't have to
get close to anybody.
You just think your
feelings all day.
- You write romance novels in your head.
- They're not all in my head.
You'd rather get into an
argument than have sex.
- So?
- And you, you klepto.
You're not even
comfortable being with you.
- Wow.
- That's okay.
That's all right. You're okay.
What is wrong with wanting to
spend your life with someone?
Why does everybody act
like that is so crazy?
Just to
wanna grow old together.
What am I doing wrong?
It's very romantic,
but it's not real love.
I know, baby.
How do you feel about
the intervention?
They're just trying to help.
I know what they say about me.
About hopeless romantics,
that we're weak.
But I'm not weak.
It takes strength to keep
believing in something
after you keep falling
flat on your face.
And I do.
I do, Joe, I believe in magic.
I believe good things happen
if you're a good person.
I believe
in soulmates and signs
and hummingbirds.
I believe that love never
dies and forever is real
and as long as I can...
Time's up.
Let's pick this
back up next week.
Wife is calling. One sec.
Hey, what's up, Mama?
- I'm with a patient.
- You talking to her again?
I told you you need
to let her go...
Love Addicts Anonymous.
Are you kidding me?
We've been doing this for years.
How long are you gonna keep banging
your head up against the wall?
Just try it.
Let's go, Fluffy.
There's no time ever to
just relax and enjoy living.
Everything is too
serious to be so serious.
If I push too hard, it's because
I want things to be better.
I want us to be better.
I want you to be better.
Sure I make waves.
I mean, you have to.
I'll keep making them until
you're every wonderful thing
you should be and will be.
You'll never find anyone
as good for you as I am.
To believe in you as much as
I do. Or love you as much.
- I know that.
- Well, then, why?
Do you think if I come back
it's gonna be okay by magic?
What's gonna be changed?
What's gonna be different?
We'll both be wrong.
We'll both lose.
Couldn't we both win?
Oh.
Look...
- She's been watching that every day till...
- Four in the morning.
At least she's not shopping
online for a new wedding dress.
She's broken, bro.
Is she, though?
It's a cry for help.
Oh, I'm gonna start a novena.
Here we go.
Lord, please help my girl.
Let's please help her.
Help her love cost a thing.
That's what I'm talking about.
Lift herself up. I
need her to stand up.
I need her to figure it out. I
need her to understand who she is.
Look deep inside and
really rectify the wrongs.
Take a break out of these delusions
and to rise up into the sky.
And as my friend Maya
Angelou would say,
"When you know who you are
no one can stop you
from being that person."
Stun.
And that is what we
need. Amen. Amen.
It should work.
It's amazing how long humans
can go before they get it.
This is Love
Addicts Anonymous.
Thanks for joining us.
Well.
We have a new face tonight.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I-I don't know how this
works. Do I just...
Do I just talk?
Why don't we start with
why you came to see me?
Okay. Um...
I haven't been
sleeping well, lately.
I guess I never have.
When I was little, I used to share
a room with my sister and, um...
I used to be so jealous of
her because she used to,
she used to sleep so
peacefully, like a rock.
And I just used to lie
there awake, thinking,
how does anybody sleep that way?
When your heart
never goes to sleep.
I guess I always had
a restless heart.
Um...
I had a broken heart once.
Long time ago.
All my friends, they told me,
you know, to slow down and...
I'm serious.
Be by myself for a
while, take it easy.
You should spend
some time alone.
I didn't.
So, here I am.
Ten years and three
divorces later.
My therapist fired me, so
now it's just me and Fluffy.
You know, I used to think
that it was everybody else
that was broken.
But now I think
maybe it was just me.

Are we gonna see
you again next week?
I know. You feel
like nobody gets you.
I don't even get me.
It's time to give up on all the old
childhood myths and fairy tales.
Like Alida and Taroo.
Maybe the hummingbird
never finds its flower.
We've all been worried
about you and, um...
Where've you been?
I've been
going through it.
That's life, innit?
You heading somewhere?
- Yeah. Therapy.
- Oh.
- He took me back.
- Oh, yeah, good.
Turns out you were
right all these years.
There are no soulmates.
There are no signs.
No happily ever after.
It's just... silly.
No. No.
Don't be so sure.
This is for you.
This is because of you.
A wedding invitation?
Can you believe it?
He's getting married.
The cynic?
Yeah, Mike.
You gonna go?
I hate weddings.
I had another dream last night.
It was a weird one.
It was different.
Tell me about it.
I was back home
in the old neighborhood
where we grew up.
And it was, like,
foggy and dark and
creepy as shit.
And all of my old
friends were there.
Hey, look. Big Time's back.
Hey!
I see this is still
your favorite corner.
- You know it.
- Knew she'll come back.
Nah, you said she'd never
make it out the Bronx.
Messing with me for
never being back home.
And Louis was there too.
Your first crush?
Yeah.
But he's old, you know.
And he says...
Flowers don't grow in the Bronx.
And I say...
Sometimes they do.
Then what happens?
I just keep walking.
And I had this feeling like
something's following me.
But every time I look
back there's no one there.
I'm getting more
and more nervous.
So I start walking
faster and faster.
I end up right across the
street from my old house
in front of the Botanica.
I know the one.
And I look in the window.
What do you see?
Red roses.
Like in the hummingbird story?
No, like, like in the
heart factory dream.
And I'm staring at them and
this big shadow comes over me.
All of a sudden
it reaches out...
I don't wanna do this.
- Let's just keep going.
- No, I don't...
Someone grabs you.
Who is it?
It's me.
But I'm little, like
eight or nine years old.
Dirty and covered
with cuts and bruises.
Does she say anything?
I didn't get enough love.
From Mom and Dad?
From you.
You left me alone.
She's mad at me.
What do you wanna say
to that little girl?
I love you.
No, you love
everybody else but me.
- I do. I I...
- Liar!
No.
Hey.
I love you.
She says...
Say it again.
I love you.
What do you wanna tell her?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

She did it.
She really did.
I can't believe I'm crying.
- Whoa!
- Damn, this light is hot.
So bright. Feels good, though.
Fairy tales. I
love happy endings.
Don't be gross.
I can't believe it happened.
I know. I can't
believe it happened.
How did this happen?
On a molecular level,
from the attraction of
atoms to each other,
we see signs of love woven into
the very fabric of our nature.
Nature?
We're all made of stardust.
Stardust.
- Ancient energy from the stars.
- Yeah.
Those little molecules
dancing inside us?
That, too, is love.
It's the unifying force
that creates harmony
- in a world of division.
- All right, babe.
A world of conflict.
Peace is love.
Progress is love.
Faith is love.
You are love.
Shh...

Great session.
Forgot to ask you.
How was the wedding?
It was nice.
Glad it wasn't mine.
All the friends were there,
you know, the whole group.
Hey, guys, this is it.
Mike was so nervous.
It was sweet.
Did you go alone? Did
you have a plus-one?
Just me.
Felt good to be there alone.
It was kinda nice seeing
all those people in love.
Reminding me that
it's still out there.
I was really happy for them.
You know, I remember thinking
I have these amazing friends and
this incredible life, you know.
And I'm good on my own.
I'm happy.
Whatever happens...
Whoever happens...
If nothing happens...
I'm good.
You know, it's raining
outside, if you need a ride.
Think I'm gonna take the bus.
I like the rain.
Magical things happen.
Okay, Miss Independent.
So you're still waiting for this
grand sign from the universe?
Always.
See you next Thursday.
