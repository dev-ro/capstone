 In this world, nobody is
better than anyone.
 We come from nothing
Return to nothingness .
 Do not mourn for the dead
 Who are gone forever.
 Take care of those who remain
 And if they can help
When you say goodbye
In a final farewell to this world
 Do not cry
because nobody is eternal
Nobody returns from the deep sleep
