Every man carries a badge.
Some symbol of his allegiance.
His were the scars of a boxer who'd used
his fists to climb the social ladder of the mob.
A Jew who'd gained the respect of wops
through a homicidal lust.
He'd sworn an oath of violence.
And his master?
His own insatiable will to power.
He wanted to own this town.
His name is Mickey Cohen.
On my badge is the city of Los Angeles.
I came back from the war
and I didn't even recognize it.
Brothels, vice, blood in the streets.
Cohen is building his empire.
