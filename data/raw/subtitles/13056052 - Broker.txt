If you're going to throw it away,
then don't give birth.
Please take care of her.
Anything?
She probably ran away.
I guess so.
Give me the towel.
Woosung, I'm sorry.
I'll be sure to come pick you up.
Here we go again.
I'll come pick him up.
No number...
They have no intention of doing that.
Hey, hurry up and delete the video.
Your eyes are bright too, huh?
Just not much hair on the eyebrows.
Even so, you're such a cute kid.
How could they think of
getting rid of you? Really, huh?
So, you're Woosung.
That's right, Woosung.
You can be happy with us now. OK?
Right?
For those wanting to transfer
to a bus or an express bus,
please exit now.
The exit for the Busan
West Intercity Bus Terminal,
is exit 3.
Gimhae International Airport is...
- How's your knee?
- Huh?
- Your knees hurt, right?
- Yes, I'm okay.
- You okay?
- Oh, it's gotten a lot better.
Okay.
You should come more often.
It'll be good for you
to exercise.
It's been a while, so I just want
to rest whenever I come here.
Is the laundry doing well these days?
It's so-so...
Hey Socrates...
By the way,
I can't believe
they're thinking of
using baby boxes
for human trafficking.
That's really bold.
It's their fault for making
those boxes in the first place
it's creating irresponsible mothers...
You have a nice side to you.
Why?
Oh, that baby.
He would've died
if he had been left on that floor.
I am nice.
You didn't know?
Was it a boy or a girl?
- Hello.
- How have you been?
You worked hard.
That dish last time was really good
It was Shu, Shu...
- Schweinshaxen.
- Oh, Schweinshaxen.
The day after
I was so surprised
because my skin was so smooth.
What are you saying?
It's just pig's feet.
And, uh,
do you happen to know Choucroute?
I'm gonna try making that next.
You should come to have a bite.
It's just boiled pork. It's bland.
I left the white one at the laundry.
I brought it in black instead.
- It's thick.
- Oh, thanks.
- And this too, just in case...
- Right, thanks.
- Go, okay, go.
- Okay.
- Take care.
- Yeah, okay.
Whatever the situation is,
you should get out of the car
and say goodbye...
It's fine.
He stays home all day anyways.
It's good for him
to get some exercise.
He's a perfect match
for a marriage partner.
Oh, really?
What about it? Do you want him?
Because even if you have a kid,
he can look after the kid
since he writes from home...
The baby's mother came to see him?
Is something wrong?
Yes.
They left the baby
outside. Outside the box.
Could it have been a mistake?
Because she was flustered?
Hey, if you think they're gonna go to
the police just bring the baby here, OK?
I'll do that.
Okay.
There's nothing on the records...
Call the pastor.
And can you please give Soo-kyung
a bath for me?
OK, sure.
You were on night
watch yesterday, right?
Yes, every Sunday...
Can you show her
some of the babies you have now?
This is a playroom for big kids.
There are 19 kids living here.
They're all abandoned in the baby box.
He came in last week...
The mother was 15 years old...
His mom is from Pakistan.
She said she was a babysitter.
That's it?
Yes, for now.
What about letters?
Did you put a letter with the baby?
Yes.
How about your name and contact number?
Did you write that, too?
So even if you have a baby,
there's no evidence
that you're the mother...
What's going on?
She's looking for a baby named Woosung.
She says she left a baby
outside the baby box yesterday.
If you had put the baby in the box,
our staff would have gone out
right away and spoken to you.
Yes.
- That's what I said.
- Peek-a-boo.
Peek-a-boo!
Of course, not.
Kidnapping?
What are you talking about?
Hey, don't you think so?
You threw him away.
What are you talking about?
I just left him with you for a bit.
Do you think we're like a dog hotel?
I even wrote in the letter
that I'd come and pick him up.
If there's a message saying
you're coming back for the baby,
the church takes
the baby off the adoption list.
He's 100% going to a childcare facility.
Do you know what that means?
Well, I'm sure you did it out of love,
but that's what narrows down
this kid's future possibilities.
We...
uh, Woosung...
we want to save Woosung
from that dark future.
It's better for him
to grow up in a nice home
than to be an orphan
in a childcare facility...
It's much better.
Adoption.
We're looking for parents to raise him.
You don't have the right to do that.
You don't have the right either,
you abandoned him.
- You stole him.
- To protect.
Yes, of course.
We don't have the right. We don't.
In other words...
Should I say it's with good intentions?
Good intentions...
I haven't heard those words in a while.
There are people wanting children
but can't have them
and can't wait
for the screening period,
we can send the baby to those parents.
You're in an explainable situation.
Your name is...
It's Seon-ah, Moon Seon-ah.
Miss Seon-ah.
You can think of us as a cupid
that sends your precious baby
to those parents.
I promise to find
the best adoptive parents for Woosung.
Cupid my ass.
Yeah, well,
it's a bit strange to call us that...
What's another good name...
Should we call ourselves the storks?
Since it's two of us, two storks?
Oh, and...
It's case by case,
but there's a little reward.
A reward?
How much was it?
It's about 10 million won for a boy.
For who?
Of course,
for you and us, the mediators...
Good intentions my ass.
You're just a broker.
To put it simply, yes.
When is the departure?
- Get some rest.
- Yes, go home.
Yes.
She's the mother of that baby, right?
I'm not sure.
She doesn't look like it...
Oh, Taeho.
What are doing h...
Oh, hello.
We're temporarily closed for today..
I don't know if this can be removed...
Oh, this...
This is...
It's obviously blood.
I'll give it a try.
And, the
the money could be here by next week...
We're going to open
a chicken restaurant here.
Well, if you can't,
I'll take you to the casino.
No. I'm not going back.
I guess he has another solution.
Then you'll have 5,000 by next week
and please take care of that shirt.
Okay.
Goodbye.
Hey, Taeho.
Since when have you been hanging out
with thugs like that?
Why are you nagging me?
Mind your own business, old man.
You were doing a good
at the restaurant with your mom.
Those noodles
make me sick to my stomach now.
What was that?
Nothing. They came to complain.
And fix this.
There's a trick to it.
Press it to the left.
Do we have to take her?
Well, it's good to have his mother
around, it'll be less suspicious.
Ms. Sun-ah, let's go, let's go.
It's like she's crazy for money.
- 50-50?
- That's right.
At least divide it into three...
If we take the Gyeongbu
Expressway to Yeongdeok,
it will take us 2
hours and 30 minutes.
We'll take a break at the rest stop
in Gyeongju around lunch time.
They wouldn't go too far
with a car like that, right?
Maybe Ulsan or Pohang?
I wanna take a shower
and change as soon as possible.
You know, right?
We're gonna catch them red-handed.
Ms. Sun-ah, where are you from?
I'm from Busan.
He's self-proclaimed from Seoul.
Self-proclaimed?
Where are you from then?
Yeosu.
Yeosu?
There's nothing
but gondolas there, isn't it?
Cable car.
The sashimi is good there.
The leaf mustard kimchi is good too...
What that?
Remember when we went to sell a kid.
And it was a male couple?
Oh, yeah, that's right, that's right.
That was in Yeosu.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I wonder how he grew up?
He must be in elementary school by now.
Night beach at Yeosu.
Stop talking nonsense.
Leave the negotiations to us.
Yeah, the customer always comes first.
Think of them as
people who chose to buy...
Hey, hey...
- What?
- They're coming.
Are you Mr. Lim Chang Ho?
I'm the guy from Busan...
- Yes, show us the baby.
- Yes, of course.
He just woke up from a nap...
Beautiful, isn't he?
By any chance,
did you use Photoshop on his pictures?
This one is not as
cute as the picture...
It's only because he just woke up.
No, you can see that even his eyebrows.
It's too thin...
That's because he's a baby. His
eyes usually look like this, like this.
He's a beautiful baby.
Woosung, open your eyes.
Open your eyes, go on.
Let's make it 400.
But you said a thousand yesterday.
Even 400 is too much in this situation.
Right.
Or we can pay in installments.
Installments are OK, right?
- 12-month installment.
- Yeah, that's good.
Well, this is something
I've never heard of before.
You can't suddenly
put up such conditions.
What can you tell us about his father?
The father?
The father, well...
Hey, don't tell me
It's not rape
or something like that, is it?
- We can't be...
- What are you talking about?
- Involved in something like that...
- No,
No, the baby's mother right here
and she's a very diligent person.
She's been all alone taking care
of her sick parents...
Hey, you crazy punk.
What, what, crazy?
Talking about no eyebrows and
small eyes, have you seen your face?
What the fuck are you talking about?
- Are you crazy?
- What, you bastard!
Ms. Sun-ah, Ms. Sun-ah. Okay.
What is this person doing? So rude...
Rude?
Yeah, I'm damn rude.
Are you polite? Huh?
When you look at other people's babies
and talk nonsense. Are you being polite?
I came all the way to
this crappy village and now what? 400?
Is this a fucking joke Fuck that.
I would never give
him to people like you.
Get the fuck out of here before I do
something I regret, you beggar bastard.
What, beggars, really...
Wait...
Beggars...
Seriously...
Wanna get some crabs?
Everything is steamed in stores.
That was harsh.
Yeah, yeah, it was harsh.
That's what I should be saying.
He was a customer.
We haggle with each other...
That's a customer.
If he wasn't a customer,
I would've beaten the shit out of him.
That's how we negotiate...
Well, with that attitude...
things won't go your...
If you want to make it work,
find a better buyer.
That makes sense.
What? 12-month installment plan
for 4 million won? Is this a joke?
What should we do?
Shall we go back to Busan?
We have no other choice.
There are other candidates, right?
- Hello, sir.
- Hey.
Is there any blood?
A little bit - Candy?
Oh, thank you.
Tomorrow is Children's Day.
Yes, my grandmother gave me
allowance when I left for work.
What about identification?
We're contacting his family now.
What's the cause of death?
I think he broke his neck
because he got beaten up.
He's still young.
I really hate blood.
This view is amazing.
Hmm.
A girl?
There will be more, right?
They can't just go back to Busan...
They can't do that.
Hi.
That person over there has been
the director for three generations.
He looks like
he's been working for 3 years, huh?
- Brother Dong-soo!
- Brother Dong-soo!
- How have you been?
- Brother Dong-soo!
- Hi, how are you?
- Hello.
- Bro, I'll show you this!
- It's brother Dong-soo!
- Hey, it's brother Dong-soo.
- Brother Dong-soo? Dong-soo?
- Wow, it's Dong-soo!
- It's Dong-soo!
It's brother Dong-soo.
Wow, it's brother Dong-soo!
Really? For real?
So that's why he wanted to come here.
You should've called
to tell me you were coming.
It looks like few are gone.
Three kids, in about 6 months?
Hey, I lose 450 a month
on subsidies
Hey, you guys go play now.
- Go play.
- Let's go.
Hey, the losing team
gets a finger flick, okay?
Hurry up and go.
What?
He got a new wife.
Hey, she's too young.
Oh? How did they meet?
A dating app?
Or something like that?
Hey, you! Hey!
Hey, you idiot,
I told you not to go in there. Hey!
Can't you see that flower?
How many times do I
have to tell you?
Dong-soo! Let's play basketball.
- Okay.
- Come on.
Nice, nice.
Remember how you told the chief that
they're selling infants
and the church was in on it?
The church is in on it.
That young man is
also a church employee.
I thought he was a part-timer?
He's an employee,
just not a full employee.
But for a professional broker,
they look like they're
doing a sloppy job...
You added lukewarm water to this, right?
It's because you didn't wait
for three minutes.
Aren't you a professional broker
if you sell and get paid?
That's right but...
I feel like saying that they're behind
an organization is going too far.
You don't like the detective department
talking shit to us, do you?
Give it to me.
Give me the ball.
No, no!
- That's not a goal! That's not a goal!
- Yoon-woo.
Yeah?
Let Ha-jun borrow it now.
Haejin, that's enough football.
Five more minutes please!
He's not improving much, that kid.
I see that the scar is still there.
You bled so much when that happened.
I called the ambulance and everything
It was crazy.
There was a kite on the branch,
I was going to grab it
when it broke...
Young-min is the only
troublemaker like that now.
Young-min?
Oh, Young-min?
He's escaping now.
Again?
At least, that hasn't changed.
I haven't heard from him.
Sorry to say...
That's not why I visit anymore.
Well, at first
it's like a blind date.
Toe.
Okay, I'll take a picture
and send it to you. Okay.
His eyebrows are a bit thin, huh?
Excuse me for a second.
- That's weird.
- Huh?
What? He looks strong with this.
But why am I playing the wife?
- Everyone here knows Dong-soo.
- Oh, it's a baby.
Then you can tell
them I'm your daughter.
So cute.
We don't look alike at all.
Hey kid, don't touch him.
Your hands are dirty from the ball.
I said don't touch him.
And we're doing this
until someone comes to buy him.
What's the big deal?
Hey, don't touch him,
your hands are dirty from the ball.
He has weird eyebrows.
Can I be your son?
Why?
I want to play football.
Football?
I want to make a lot
of money like Son Heung-min.
Well, it hasn't been long
since Woosung was born...
And it's too early to talk
about a second kid, right?
Right, one's enough.
It would be a good suggestion.
There was a kid from here
who became a professional footballer.
He wore... what was it,
the team with stripes on their uniforms?
No idea.
Well, these facilities
they promote saying
even people like us can succeed but
97% - Stop being a smart ass.
3% is great, too.
Look at him getting riled up
about this place.
What percent
of the average is successful then...
Who is it?
They said he escaped.
Must've been caught and brought back.
I broke Dong-soo's record!
It took them 3 days to catch me.
That's nothing to brag about.
Considering time and distance,
I was much ahead.
You must be real proud.
Yes, hello?
Okay, I understand.
You're in Uljin, right?
- No, no. That's alright.
- What the hell?
- We'll see you tomorrow.
- What's up with your eyebrows?
Here is your order seafood doenjang.
The coin laundromat...
This is Si-woo, he
was a grade below me.
- I was the forward.
- Buttons.
- And he was the midfielder.
- Do they attach the buttons?
Back then, we would've made
two football teams.
- Don't you think so?
- Well now,
- When I go as a coach...
- I take the seams out
from pants they shortened
- 11 players...
- The worn out knees.
- They don't put a lining, right?
- No, there's no one.
You know that law, adoption...
Yeah, the adoption law.
The conditions for
overseas adoptions
became more strict
so I thought it was good.
But don't all the kids
want to be adopted?
Oh, well...
That kid that likes football,
he seems very active.
Yes, Haejin.
It's already too late for him.
He's 7 years old.
He's 8.
Oh, too late. Too late.
Too late for him.
Adoption... you can say
that's only for kids
below 6...
Even he should know by now...
There are also kids that come
because they don't want it.
There was a case like
that recently, remember?
The adopted child was abused.
It's because blood
is thicker than water.
Think about what would've happened
if the parents had a biological baby
after the adoption.
Yeah, that's for most of the kids here
at least once, right?
They were denied of their existence
when they were abandoned, right?
And they experience it again.
Then, I've been denied all my life.
What?
Then do something about that whistle.
You're not the military.
Hey - The whistle.
For me, it's like
me wanting to be like a father to them.
Understand?
So that's why I'm using this whistle
like this, OK?
Hey, hurry up and hide.
Good night, my baby.
In the front garden and back garden,
birds and baby sheep,
they're all asleep.
She was singing.
What song?
A lullaby.
A lullaby?
It's so nice here because
they have everything you need.
Let's take it all.
Rub his earlobes like this.
You talk too much...
Well, if we search a little more,
we could find a someone
with better conditions.
Just go with the ones in Uljin.
All done.
You were so good during your bath.
Your mom wants to say goodbye to you
as soon as possible.
We're working so hard...
Do you know how hard
it is to raise a child by yourself?
That's still not a reason to
abandon your child.
How are you going
to justify selling them?
There are people
selling them because
there are people
abandoning them.
That's the right order.
Then you shouldn't have made that box.
That's what I'm saying.
It's only there to make the mothers
feel at ease
by telling them we're saving
the baby or whatever.
That's not the case.
Woosung is alive
because of that box.
That wipe has alcohol in it
you can't wipe his face with that.
Look at him crying.
Sorry, I'm sorry.
Then how many mothers
do you think come back for them
after leaving only a letter behind?
How would I know?
It's one out of forty.
You never hear from
the other 39 ever again.
Why are you only complaining about the
mothers? Say the same about the dads.
You could've at least left
your contacts in the letter.
This is the second time hearing that.
What? You want me to tell you again?
I can tell you many times as you want.
Who are you to be so arrogant?
Do you think you're
something because
the kids call you big brother
at this pathetic place?
You feel proud?
Then just stay here.
Oh, it's cold.
He thought
his mother would be one in forty.
Well, you see that old door there
outside at the playground? Over there.
They said he was abandoned there
with a letter saying,
"I'll be back to get you."
That's the reason why he's so grumpy
so please cut him some slack.
Jiyoung was working.
Yeah, she came back.
Becoming a singer was
never gonna happen.
I liked her voice though.
3 to 1.
Well
we all settle down here.
But it looks fun.
- Yeah?
- 4 to 1.
Fun?
It's more fun than
being alone I suppose.
Still.
You should go far away, far.
Far away, where?
Far.
You're the hope
and the star for us kids.
Where am I supposed to go?
Anywhere.
I think it'll be sad
if you do come back, really.
Good morning.
Woosung, it's raining.
It's raining.
This is a raindrop.
It's the same thing.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I was too harsh.
I don't remember.
I have these dreams sometimes
it's raining...
And the rain washes me clean
from everything of my past.
But when I open my eyes,
it's still pouring.
And nothing has changed.
Wouldn't it be okay
if you had an umbrella?
An umbrella?
Yes, a big umbrella.
Something that two people can use...
Stop it.
I hope it's red
One with strawberries on it.
When I was young,
my friend had something like that.
I was so jealous.
You stole it?
Yeah, I took it and threw it away.
But they're not blood related, are they?
Yeah, everyone calls her mom, but...
Everyone?
It woke me up
and my husband, too.
We were so shocked
that we couldn't sleep.
What's happening?
No, a police car came to them.
- What's happened? Huh?
- Quiet, quiet.
- Hey, come here.
- Hold on a second.
No, that...
I've never seen him before.
What's going on?
He was killed in a hotel, then...
Take a good look.
It's a picture captured by the hotel
CCTV. The girl lives here, right?
Yeji.
Take the kids over there.
Really, in front of the kids..
Hang on. Hey tall kid.
Tall kid, wait a minute.
Here, candy.
You can tell me anything.
She lives here, right?
I don't know.
Ma'am,
This kid here is a baby, isn't he?
I told her not to give birth.
How can a girl become a mother?
What? What did you say?
I said I told her not to give birth!
How can a girl like
that become a mother?
Quiet! Quiet!
Then is this... what you do here.
Is this mother-like?
Well, I
just took care of the kids
who didn't have a place to go.
Murder?
You mean prostitution?
So you're saying
that she needed to run,
but the baby got in her way.
Give me three days. I'm going to
make sure they sell within that time.
If it's murder,
the detective department will move?
They're already on the move.
We should set them up.
A set-up?
As a buyer.
- The person you're calling...
- Shit...
She's not picking up,
the one from Uljin.
This is all because you sent her
the picture with weird eyebrows.
What do you think of this?
20 million won.
Twice the market price...
Do you want to meet them?
Huh? Who?
I think it's the owner of the building.
How old is the woman?
36.
- Why?
- You want someone younger?
No, it's not that.
I have a bad feeling about this though.
Isn't this too cheap?
10 million?
The market price for the baby.
A girl baby only costs 8 million won.
Miss - Yeah?
Using bait to provoke crime...
Two million won.
- Isn't that against the law?
- What's the difference?
This is pissing me off.
What did you say?
I've learned that it's not even taken
as evidence in a trial.
They had intentions
to commit the crime from the start.
This isn't crime induction.
It's giving them an opportunity.
Opportunity...
Oh, Bro Socrates...
Hey, if we get a deal there, you know...
Do you want to go to that place
when we get back to Busan?
Are you asking to go see Jennifer?
No, you can go on your own.
- I'm not interested in those places.
- Keep it down, you punk...
You're good at
talking nonsense even in this situation.
Just to relax the situation.
Even in the military,
before the soldiers go to training.
You didn't even go to the military
because you were in jail.
You didn't go either.
You exempted for
being from an orphanage.
I'm on the same level
as gold medalists.
Why is love like this again?
What's wrong?
Why would you pull over here?
I think I'm gonna pee.
I'm really going to pee.
This kid...
I told you.
I have a bad feeling about this.
That hunch was this?
Car was shaking so much
that I almost peed a little bit.
This car stinks.
Look at this kid talking like this
No one told you to get in the car.
Sir, can you take me with you?
No, everyone will be worried.
I'll give you some money,
you take the bus home by yourself.
No.
Why are you trying to
interrupt our family trip?
I already know.
You're not a family.
You're trying to sell Woosung.
- How much did you hear?
- Everything.
Please be careful.
I'll put this here.
The important thing
is to not say negative things like,
"The baby doesn't have thick hair",
or, "His eyes are too small."
And don't ask the mother
about the baby's biological father.
- There must be something going on.
- Okay,
- Have some coffee.
- Yes, thank you.
Yes, thank you.
Do they look like building owners?
Aren't you a bit young?
I'm sorry.
No, you don't need to apologize.
Oh, okay.
So, you two are married
but not officially registered.
That's why official adoption
is not an option for you.
- Okay.
- Yes.
And let's say your
sperm count is a bit low.
Me?
Just give them the money
quickly and do it naturally.
Got it. Your sperm count
is low and speak naturally...
Not enough sperm count
and money quickly...
Then, let's practice our line.
Yes, okay.
And this is the money we've prepared.
It's already been 5 years since
we started the infertility treatment.
And we're exhausted from waiting.
Hey detective, how about we mention
the de facto marriage story here?
Since our marriage is not legal,
legal adoption is not easy,
something like that...
Okay, let's go with that.
Thank you.
We will cherish him
like our actual child.
Should we take out
the "actual" from that sentence?
Should I take out "actual"?
Oh, okay, minus the "actual", right.
Let's really cherish our children
No...
We will cherish our children...
- What did I say?
- Cherish.
Oh, right.
We will cherish
the baby
like our very own.
Jin jin ja ra, Ji ri ji ri ja.
Jin jin ja ra, Ji ri ji ri ja.
Jin jin ja ra, Ji ri ji ri ja.
Oh, can I call this car Hae Jin-ho?
Yeah, suit yourself.
Yes!
But Jennifer? Who's Jennifer?
That's Dong-soo's girlfriend.
Hey, what does it say here?
- Oh, this?
- Yes.
Hae-jin.
It's my name.
The pastor gave it to me.
You must really like your name.
No.
This is the only way to not get it
stolen at the orphanage.
Thieves steal everything
even if you write your name on it.
- 9388, pull over to the right.
- Right?
9388, pull over to the right.
What? I didn't even speed up.
Damn, huh?
You're the wife...
So, let's say that you are
our store employees and are a couple.
No, we don't have to be a couple.
I don't like it either.
Then let's call you a relative.
A distant relative.
- Got it?
- What? Second cousin? Eighth?
- That's not...
- Hello.
Good day, sir.
Your license please.
Sure.
But I wasn't speeding...
Mr. Ha Jin-young.
Your trunk door is open.
You'll cause a huge accident
if things were too fall out
I'm sorry.
Are you all going somewhere?
Yes.
We're going to Lotte World
to ride the Ferris wheel.
Wow, you're going far, aren't you?
Yes, we're going on a family trip.
But there's no Ferris wheel there.
Really?
If you want to ride a Ferris wheel,
you have to go to Wolmido.
Shall we go to Wolmido then?
If you have time, - Yes.
Ask your dad for a ride
on the cruise ship.
- Yeah!
- I'm a little weak on boats.
I get motion sickness...
- Do you run a laundry?
- Yes.
I recently got this shirt
back from a dry cleaners.
It got all shriveled up.
What's wrong with this?
This needs to be dry cleaned
but it looks like they just washed it.
Oh, really?
There are so many amateurs
in dry cleaning these days.
- Boss...
- You have to pay attention.
- Make sure to clean this...
- Boss!
- What?
- I think we should go...
- Yeah, we have to...
- Your license, yes.
Yes, thank you.
You have to dry clean it next time.
- All right.
- Okay.
- Have a good time.
- Yes.
- To Wolmido.
- Okay.
- Oh, my. Hello.
- Oh, yes.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Did you wait long?
- Not at all.
- No.
We just got here.
- I see.
- Yes.
I'm Ha Sang-hyun.
Are you Song Ji-chul?
Yes, that's correct.
- Is he Woosung?
- Yes, yes.
- Are you his mother?
- Yes.
Could I please hold the baby?
Yes, go ahead.
I touched him.
I'm touching him, honey.
His facial features are so clear now.
- Yes.
- Yes.
You're really
going to raise him properly, right?
Of course, we will really cherish him.
Are you going to cherish him the
same way even if your own child is born?
Of course.
- You're serious?
- That's enough.
- I should pay, huh?
- Yeah, this is really happening.
Give them the money...
- Even his eyebrows are now...
- And your infertility treatment?
We've already been
doing it for 5 years, so…
- Both of us.
- Both of us have gotten tired of it.
- Right.
- So that's why we…
We're not officially married, so...
Honey.
Have you tested for AMH?
Or HSG?
- Yeah, well, that one...
- Yes.
I guess Letrozole didn't work.
Yes. Letrozole had such
serious side effects, so I...
It's so hard for her to watch me like
that, so I intend to stop taking it now.
Letrozole is an
ovulation-inducing product.
Of course it won't
work if you take that.
I know, right? So, my sperm...
We're talking about
ovulation-inducing drugs.
Why are you bringing up sperm?
Here, here.
Take this, take this.
That's just for resale, right?
I recognized it right away.
Do you know about
reselling medication?
Haejin, don't open that window.
- Someone paid them to do it.
- Don't touch me.
But how do you know
so much about infertility treatment?
Wow, there's a lot of foam.
No, something similar
happened last year, hyung was scammed.
I said don't touch me.
I'm just, just looking.
If we had given up on him,
Woosung would have gone
to another country by now...
Hey!
Hey, hey, close it, close it, you punk!
Close it, you punk!
Hey, hey, close it. Hurry up!
He's going to catch a cold.
Let's take care of what's in the back.
Stop it.
But that driver's
license I saw earlier...
Yeah?
Who's Ha Jin-young?
Sanghyun is my nickname
From when I was in the military.
Right so, hyung, you know you didn't go
to the military, don't you? Right?
Figure it out, punk.
What about you?
"I have a weak stomach,
so I get motion sickness"?
Wasn't that entirely real?
What do you mean it was real?
It was completely ridiculous.
Haejin was better.
Idiot.
Actually, the name Sang-hyun...
I was going to give it to
my son when he was born.
Really?
Yeah.
It's not really a funny
story or anything, huh?
So-young...
Huh?
My real name is Moon So-young.
Then Sun-ah is...
Just a really annoying
lady who lives next door.
What a bunch of liars, am I right?
I mean, since this happened...
Should we use it?
A person's death.
Hello.
Who's this?
Hand over the baby.
You paid all the money to that mother.
5 million won.
You were supposed to erase
that baby on that condition.
Why did you give birth to that baby?
Moon So-young, we're the police.
Can I talk with you for a moment?
You're here?
You're here?
Took you a while.
We're making a three-person work
responsibility schedule.
A work responsibility schedule?
A schedule for feeding milk to Woosung.
Did something good happen?
Yes.
I have a guest in Seoul.
They're giving me 30 million won.
Oh, that's amazing.
Are you going to give him a bath now?
Oh, no.
He has poop on his butt,
and this hyung is really bad at this.
Okay, two-hour shifts from 10 p.m.
until 6 a.m., how about that?
"Sang, Dong, So, Dong, Sang..."
Wait, this is a schedule where
you sleep well for 6 hours, ya know.
No, rather than sleeping well…
can't I do this?
- That's a bit too much.
- Oh, really?
- I want to do it.
- What?
- Feeding him powdered milk.
- Really?
- Then from 4am to 6am?
- Yes.
Then, from 10pm to 12pm.
You can't take your
shift out and give it away.
Don't you think she seems
easy to cooperate with?
You're right.
Did the commutation
of the sentence reduction work?
No, I don't think so.
- Give it to me.
- Then what?
Hey, then...
I don't know, well, I...
I don't know, but...
Just do it all.
I don't think it's a commutation.
I want to take a bath, too.
You wash yourself.
Geez, I don't want to.
How is he? Did you feed him?
No, he threw up again.
Are you sure you cooled it down?
Isn't it because it's too hot?
It was fine.
Is it because he got wet yesterday?
I'm sorry, Woosung.
No, it's not your fault.
No, I don't think it's just a cold...
Have you ever done it before?
We have to take him
to the hospital, hyung.
We can't do that.
We might get caught.
It's not like meningitis, right?
Since yesterday,
his fever suddenly went up...
Will he get better?
What if he dies?
Is he your little brother?
Yes.
He'll be fine. He won't die.
It looks like a cold,
but make sure that you
keep an eye on him
so that it doesn't
spread into pneumonia.
For now, I'll give you a fever reducer.
If his fever doesn't go down,
come back tomorrow.
Woosung, that's great.
What's sadder than love
is affection.
Will the baby be okay?
Everyone's making a fuss...
Anyway, It's just a cold.
Well, that's true, but...
But it'll be a big problem
if he doesn't get better soon.
Are you afraid they
won't be able to sell him?
Well, if they can't sell him,
we can't catch them in the act.
I thought since you're in the Department
for Women and Adolescents…
I thought you should've
cast your net a little
higher up the river
than the detectives.
Higher up the river?
Shouldn't you have saved her
first before she abandoned the baby?
That's the Department
of Health's job, okay?
Before she throws him away,
it's Department of Health's case.
After she abandons
him, it's the police's.
Seriously.
Team leader,
why are you so cold to that woman?
She's irresponsible.
Because she gave birth
to him and threw him away,
but we can't conclude
that she's the same.
Do you understand how a mother
feels about abandoning her child?
I guess I can't.
He can't do this.
This isn't a playground.
Right, yes, this is...
- Are you his father?
- Oh, yes...
- There are a lot of patients here…
- Okay.
- Please be careful.
- Yes, okay.
Are you Woosung's father?
Yeah, oh...
Yes.
What's his resident registration number?
- Got it?
- Yes.
Okay.
Actually, he's only one month old so...
- One month?
- Everyone was surprised.
Is it because of that
powdered milk? That...
That American brand... What was it?
Similac...
Similac.
- His grandmother is in the countryside.
- Yes.
- I wonder how many she sent me...
- I know.
She must be so happy
to have her first grandchild.
Okay, then, Woosung's
father, please come this way...
Oh, okay.
Gosh, that kid,
he plays soccer all the time...
That's why the owner always squeaks.
Jin jin ja ra, Jiri jiri ja.
- Jin jin ja ra, Jiri jiri ja.
- What's wrong with him and how...
Thank you for taking care of Woosung.
Well, babies get fever and they grow up.
If I were alone,
I wouldn't be able to do anything.
You don't have to do it all by yourself.
The father
of Woosung?
I was against it from the beginning.
I see...
She probably ran away with the baby.
Find him and bring him back.
The girl?
The baby.
What are you going to do with the baby?
I'm going to raise him.
I will.
Because he's my husband's child.
It's fully automatic?
Are you kidding me?
How do you do this?
Oh, Taeho.
Uh, I'm sorry,
but I'll rush the money.
What?
Baby? Who, who?
Woosung's father?
How much?
Four thousand?
He's totally asleep.
I guess he's tired.
You've been worrying about him all day.
He looks like Siwoo.
These types don't
sell well and get left behind.
Didn't you want to be adopted?
I really liked it there.
That's why I refused
to talk about adoption.
Because your mom said she'd pick you up?
What else did hyung tell you?
Um, he told me about the letter.
'Cause I never thought I'd be abandoned.
He fell asleep.
Do you want to try?
Please just do me a favor.
Put his chin on your shoulder.
I know. I know.
- No, a little higher.
- I said I know.
- Hey, that's too weak...
- Oh, you're too loud, just...
You're not taking care
of Woosung on purpose, are you?
Huh?
I'm afraid you won't be
able to part ways later.
Why are you laughing?
It's perfect for girls.
Why are you saying
the same thing as hyung?
Where are you going?
Convenience store.
Do you want me to go instead?
There are things that
women can't ask others to do.
Bring an umbrella in case it rains.
Come and pick me up if it rains.
With an umbrella.
I don't want to.
I'll be back.
Where did you meet that mother?
I was sleeping on Songdo beach
after running away from home,
and she told me to come if I was hungry.
And then you were
forced to prostitute yourself?
Do you pity me?
- No, that's not what I meant...
- I did it even before I met his mom.
Then, why did you kill him?
It's because of, well
fit of rage?
In a fit of rage?
He's telling me to lick it before I
take a shower, that crazy bastard...
So the first other person...
i mean, was it self-defense or...
If you want to know the list of
the other customers, I can tell you.
That's enough.
All I want to know is...
Is this an interrogation? Or a sermon?
Like I said, the baby
will be sold, so don't worry.
My team leader
and I want to help you...
Have you ever abandoned a child?
Have you ever killed a man?
Okay, then tell me,
because I don't understand.
Why did you throw him away
outside the church?
You saw that?
If you left him like that, he'd be dead.
That's because
I didn't want to see him again.
Why did you give birth
to him if you couldn't raise him?
Are you saying I
should've aborted him?
If you're thinking about the child,
don't you have that option?
Is it lighter crime
to kill the child
before giving birth
than to throw it away
after giving birth?
Well...
Since no one wants them,
aren't babies more
unhappy when they're born?
You're saying I should've
killed him before he was born?
You talk like that
in front of Woosung?
What did you mean by throwing him away?
Yes.
Uh, you know,
can you get me some
clothes? My buttons fell off.
Yes, in Uljin.
Right?
No, it's okay.
Look at this.
Hold on. Listen to this song.
Hello? Oh, can you hear
it? Do you remember this?
In the movie we watched together...
The one that came out...
That's right.
In reality, well,
that's not gonna happen.
Rice? What rice?
Oh, like in the wedding?
Yes.
No, I don't think so.
Sorry.
It's just.
Poke it on the outside.
Look at the bottom
of the button like this.
If you spin it a few times,
if you spin it like this,
it's not coming off.
Wow, Dong-soo hyung,
how do you do that?
- Hae-jin, try this one, too.
- I want to do it, too.
I said try this one out, too.
No, I want to do this.
What kind of person are
you meeting tomorrow?
Someone rich, of course.
With that 40 million won...
It's 3,000.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's 3,000, 3,000.
Why? What kind of
person do you want it to be?
Someone as pretty as So-young.
Hey, Dong-soo, learn from him. Learn.
You shouldn't let
a man say such empty words, man.
Oh, I learned a lesson, Master.
What?
I couldn't hear you that well.
In the past, it was said the
eldest son takes after
his mom and the eldest
daughter takes after her dad.
So our house is ruined.
It's okay. We don't live together.
That's all superstition.
Oh, she's the eldest daughter.
Shut up.
Whenever I see pictures
of my mom, I get surprised.
I thought it was me.
The button was about to fall off.
Now, okay.
Where are you going?
To wash up.
Even he
doesn't know his parents' faces either.
Living without knowing...
There are cases like that.
It's better if Woosung
doesn't know my face.
Why do you think so?
Because I'm a murderer.
Murder?
Yes.
Who'd you kill?
Woosung's biological father.
Why?
He shouldn't have been born like this.
I was going to take Woosung away.
What?
His wife is probably after me by now.
So if you're going to sell it properly,
you can leave me behind.
Uh, I'm out of the motel right now.
Okay, hold on.
Uh, wait.
Let me ask you something.
Hyung.
What are you doing here?
Well, what So young said yesterday
was on my mind, so I looked here.
This...
What's this?
Is this GPS?
Where did you find this?
Over here.
Is it the police?
The police don't use
old items like this these days.
That means they've been following us.
Don't you think so?
Woosung's paternal side.
I can't.
Can't what?
Hyung, you're thinking
of leaving So-young here.
Well...
This time, it's not money,
it's about convincing So young.
Let's find her a buyer like that.
Hey, man, money isn't everything.
Then that's a relief.
Then I'll take care of this myself.
What?
What are you doing now?
I know everything.
Woosung's dad is dead.
Who cares?
You just need to get paid.
I mean, who the hell is
trying to save Woosung?
A dead man's wife.
What is she going to
do after buying him?
She wanted to raise him.
Raise him?
Let's not talk nonsense.
You're trying to sell
him out, aren't you?
You're going abroad, huh?
I will never sell him.
Come out, mister. Come out.
Hey, hey.
Who the hell are you?
I see.
Are you from Woosung's father's side?
Shut up. Give me the kid. Hey, are
you not coming out? Come out! Come out!
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, isn't he dead?
Hey, he's the son of
someone I know, you punk.
It's okay. He just passed out.
Let's do it together.
Where are they going now?
Oh, they're heading
south along this road.
I think we can
catch up with them in about 5km.
- Speed up a little bit.
- Okay.
I let my guard down.
Oh.
I had a dream.
Once, my daughter,
wife, and mom rode
this and went to Wolmido.
And then...
That's a nice dream.
No, not really.
Why do you think she
showed it to us on purpose?
- Their destination?
- Yes.
I guess she wants us to follow them.
You mean not to lose Woosung?
I guess that's what she's thinking.
Are you gonna be okay?
It's on me.
That's not what I meant.
I'm just going by myself if I have to.
Even so, it's fine.
As long as it's not
like installments or anything like that.
- So-young.
- Yes?
You put Woosung in the box.
I mean, were you
really going to pick him up again?
No.
I don't know.
But...
If we have met a little earlier...
I wouldn't have had to throw him away.
It's not too late.
Huh? What was that?
Oh, nothing.
So-young only has you, Mr. Sang-hyun.
You're too mean.
Really? Okay, touch the baton then.
What kind of man do you like, noon a?
Huh?
I'm not sure.
A guy who looks good
in overalls like you?
Hae-jin, that's a nice name.
I like your name.
That means heading to the sea, right?
When you grow up,
I'm sure you'll be working abroad.
In the Premier League?
That's right.
Who named Woosung?
I did.
Sounds wonderful.
What does Woosung mean?
Woo means wings,
Sung means star.
It means I want him to go far away.
If Heajin is going to the sea,
then Woosung is over there,
beyond the sky going
to the stars, like this.
Just like an astronaut?
Or a pilot?
You two look like siblings.
Oh, yes, hello?
Well, I'd like to make
an appointment for an hour or two.
I'll see you at 12:00. Yeah, yeah.
All right, okay.
Today's star is Woosung.
Understand?
- If they adopt me...
- No, never.
Oh, thank you so much
for doing us a favor.
I've already told you this,
but my wife had a stillborn...
I don't want to think about
the next time, so...
Yes, you must have had a hard time.
It was a girl.
She was a cute baby
that looked like him...
Oh, let's sit down
and have some coffee...
Oh, how about ice coffee?
Okay.
Can I hold him?
Oh, sure, yes.
Excuse me...
Yes, iced coffee.
- One, two, three...
- Woosung.
It's all right, I'm not scary.
Maybe he's hungry?
- Get the formula.
- Is he hungry?
- Oh, yes.
- If it's okay...
Do you mind if
I try breastfeeding him?
It's fine, right?
Okay, then, i...
Over there, yes.
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you, yeah.
Woosung.
It's okay, it's all right.
Oh, how...
Drink, drink it, yes.
Yes, go ahead.
Oh, good.
Oh, that's good.
I didn't write it in the mail,
but can I make a suggestion?
I was thinking, in the future...
I want to raise Woosung as my own child.
So I don't want Woosung
to meet his biological
mother after this.
I'm sure it'll be hard,
so think about it slowly today.
No on a, noon a, over here.
Here, here, here.
Wow, that turned out good.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
It's a monorail. Bye.
Good bye.
Let's take a picture here.
Let's take a picture.
Come in, hurry.
Do you have money?
4,000 won.
What prize do you want?
No, not yet, not yet.
I haven't tried it yet.
Hold on, hold on.
The monkey doll,
the monkey doll!
- The monkey doll.
- I'm screwed.
I can't make a mistake, huh?
Wai, wait.
- I want to try it too.
- Go! Go! Go!
I want to try, too.
Hae-jin, there's a soccer field
Look.
- Okay.
- Yeah?
- That's the soccer field.
- Okay.
I'm scared right now.
I'm afraid of heights.
Oh, my
But you said wanted to ride it.
Back then, I was just...
Hey, what's wrong with your face?
Hey, you're not going
to throw up, are you?
Why are you so blue?
Are you okay?
- Hey, you can't throw up here.
- Okay.
- Huh?
- Okay.
- Don't throw up here.
- Okay.
Gosh, this kid. I tried to be
nice to you like a mother, but...
Take me there.
- Where?
- The new car...
- Huh?
- New car...
- A new car? A new car?
- Yeah.
You mean, with the water
on top, you like that?
Yes.
Okay, let's come back
when things go well tomorrow.
When we get there, - Yes.
Tell me.
Sure, yes.
- Don't throw up.
- Okay.
Oh, this kid, gosh...
Should we look for more?
Or you can quit.
You can send him for adoption.
Still...
Then
we can raise him.
We?
The four of us...
The five of us, with
Hae-jin, that sounds nice.
What a weird family.
Who's father is who's dad?
I'll be Woosung's dad.
That's what people usually say
when they propose, you know?
Is that so?
I wish I could start over like that.
But it won't work.
I'm gonna be arrested soon.
Moon, a prostitute in Busan,
killed a man and ran away.
When the baby got in the way,
she throws it away in the baby box.
Does it come out like this?
They don't blur the face these days.
Oh, yeah?
It shook a bit, right?
It's okay. It's because
we're at the top.
I'm scared 'cause
I can't see anything.
It's weird...
I feel a bit relaxed
when I see you.
Why is that?
My mother...
I thought there might be
a reason why she had to abandon me.
But still...
You don't have to forgive her.
Because it doesn't change
the fact that she's a terrible mother.
That's why.
I will forgive you instead.
Woosung will never forgive me.
You threw away Woosung
because you didn't
want to make him a murderer's child.
But still,
I threw him away.
I guess I was the one
who wanted to sell him the most.
We're more like brokers.
Was it when you were young?
You were in my arms
you almost threw up, but...
You didn't throw up.
I hugged you against my stomach.
I don't remember.
I was 3 years old.
Has it been that long?
How can you solve
such a difficult question already?
Why? Who is it?
Mom.
Why? Answer it.
What? Is it a text message?
Text her back.
Should we take a
selfie and send it to her?
It's fine.
Here's your order.
Enjoy your meal.
Dig in. It looks delicious.
Dad will have
a lot of money coming tomorrow.
Then like in the past,
the three of us in Busan.
Oh, daddy can come to Seoul...
Now that you have money,
please don't contact me again.
That's what mom said.
Mom did...
But she seriously told me
don't ever come back home.
Last time, daddy was so drunk.
Oh, this straw is
a heart. It's shaped like a heart.
You know what,
the baby's going to be born soon.
Mom's?
Yes, a boy.
Oh, I see.
Well, then tell your
mom congratulations.
Sorry.
Oh, don't be.
But I'll continue to be your dad.
Right?
Really?
Of couse.
I better go.
Let's meet again.
Steak, steak...
Should I try that?
Anyway, I wish you success tomorrow...
Here.
Here...
Woosung, say, "Hae-jin hyung."
"Hae-jin hyung. Hae-jin hyung."
Oh! He said Hae-jin.
That must be you.
- Woosung, did you? Right?
- That's right, he did.
Woosung, you must never forget it.
He will forget it soon.
You just have to remember everything,
even on Woosung's behalf.
Gosh, this kid. No matter how
you look at it, he's really unfortunate.
I totally agree.
Woosung, we really had fun today,
so let's not forget
about today in the future.
So young doesn't talk to Woosung.
No?
No, I've never seen it before either.
It's the last day. Say something.
What should I say?
Well, anything.
Well, "Thank you for being born." there.
Well, people usually say
something like that, what?
He doesn't even understand anything.
Even if he doesn't understand
he would want to
hear it at least once...
Sister, then tell us everything.
- Everything?
- Yes.
- Everything, here?
- Yes!
This idiot.
I'll pass.
What?
If she talks first to him...
Then, I'll pass, too.
Fine, I'll talk to him.
Everyone, close your eyes, then.
W-Wait, wait a second!
Let's turn off the light.
What, hey!
If you turn off the lights,
How can I eat my steak...
Hey! Don't turn off the lights.
Don't turn it off...
Okay, I'm going to start.
Hae-jin, thank you for being born.
Sang-hyun,
thank you for being born.
Dong-soo,
thank you for being born.
Woosung,
thank you
for being born.
So-young,
So young, thank you for being born, too.
Now, now, let's sleep everyone.
Good night.
I'll make a suggestion.
Let's say you turn yourself in.
What?
Woosung...
You don't have to sell him anymore.
What, you said to sell him,
and now I shouldn't?
If you turn yourself in,
you'll be on parole
for the first time in three years.
Then, you can live with
Woosung again someday.
Those two people
cannot become parents, I'm afraid.
I agree.
The couple I met today was like that.
Woosung is not abandoned,
he's a protected child.
He'll grow up talking
about that every day.
I hope Woosung grows up
under that kind of people.
Then..
Then..
He doesn't have to live like me.
Where are you going?
So-young isn't here either.
So young is probably meeting
with the detectives outside right now.
So-young is not the type to sell us out.
No, it can happen.
She'll do anything for Woosung.
But
she can do that.
You too, man. You'll find out
when you become a parent.
Will So-young
be able to start over
if she sells us out?
Of course.
No matter what,
with Woosung.
If you go ahead,
I'll catch up with you in a while.
Hey, come here.
- Hey, Taeho.
- Come here.
- I need to talk to you.
- Come on.
- Wait.
- Let go.
You haven't given up yet?
Hey, wait.
Of course, so don't ask.
Hey, think about it too.
If that woman raises that kid,
I don't think he'll grow up.
Would that make you happy? Huh?
Why are you pretending to be nice, huh?
You're just a broker.
Seriously, come on, let go.
- Oh, seriously.
- I need to talk to you.
Hey, come on.
Do business with me
with that 40 million won, huh?
That's bullshit.
Why would I do that with you?
I don't work with Dong-soo anymore.
What?
I don't know what to do with them.
I don't need them anymore...
She scolded me
a lot for saying that yesterday.
You suddenly brought that up.
We're being rude to his mother.
So, uh
you can call us whenever
you want to see him.
Please tell his mother, please.
I don't want to hide anything from him.
I think it would be okay
even if we would send away
Woosung to people like you.
Oh? Who is that?
Maybe Sang-hyun.
Yes, who are you?
This is the police.
No, this is... What is this?
May I help you?
I need you to come with me
on charges of illegal child trafficking.
Honey.
You stay in there for a second.
Well, wait a minute. I'll go out...
Mr. Kim Dong-soo? You're under
arrest for human trafficking charges.
Dong-soo hyung!
Where is So-young?
She turned herself in.
What about the other one?
I don't know.
- Take him away.
- Yes.
Let's go.
Fortunately, there were no casualties.
The fire accident at
the Incheon officetel turned out to be
caused by an electric short circuit.
In other news,
new information about the body
found in an underground shopping mall
in downtown Seoul early on the 8th.
The victim was identified as Shin,
a gang member in Busan,
and the police were at a motel
where the victim stayed.
About 40 million won in cash
has been found.
Police are investigating the case,
leaving the possibility open
for both crime and accident.
Also in the news today,
celebrating Family Month in May,
events for families
were held all over the country.
Children in Seoul...
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing?
What do you think you're doing?
Woosung!
Woosung!
Did you have fun?
Shall we go in the water?
Let's go in.
I love it. I love it.
Look over there.
Should we try putting our feet in?
Moon So young, long time no see.
So young got out of
prison half a year earlier.
I heard the good news.
On that day, she
asked you to take charge
of Woosung on the
day you were in the car.
It's been three years now.
It's a fire truck.
I will be waiting
with Woosung at the park in front
of the newly opened
Busan Skyland for an hour from 12:00
on the 15th of this month.
We still don't know
where Sang-hyun is and what he's doing,
but I contacted Dong-soo and Hae-jin.
Haejin, hurry up and get in.
Mr. Yoon's family,
which So young wanted so much,
is on probation.
They can't be his official
adoptive parents,
But still,
they meet with Woosung sometimes.
He plays with them.
If this is a difficult time,
we will meet again on
the 15th of next month.
I hope we can discuss
Woosung's future together.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
