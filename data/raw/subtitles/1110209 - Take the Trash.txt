SCANBOX and TV2 DENMARK
Written by:
Mick Oegendahl and Rasmus Heide
Are you Theodor Joergensen?
- I assume you're Jesper Jansen?
- Jensen.
- Jesper Jensen.
- Right.
The girl over there is Lotte Markmann.
She's been here two years.
Excuse me?
Electronic, hazardous
and combustible.
'Thank you'
You're welcome.
Over there...
Dion!
A good guy but a little slow.
Be specific,
or he won't get off his ass.
And you, my friend, are not the first
of your kind to work at my site.
And believe you me...
I'll be watching you.
Follow me.
Take The Trash
ITS Infocom, Jesper Jensen.
Stenlose municipality, yes.
Lars is a fine consultant, but he
doesn't have the technical know-how.
Hey, stop.
I think you got it backwards.
I pay my top-bracket taxes,
whether I like it or not -
- which implies that people like you
pick up after people like me.
If you don't mind.
Thank you!
It's called refuse collection!
It may sound French, but it's Latin.
I'm back. Sorry about that.
I look forward
to doing business with you.
That's right, Jesper Jensen.
- This rubbish is jammed again.
- There, there. Language, dear.
- When I...
- Yes.
Up and running again.
- I'll give it the once-over on Monday.
- You don't have to do that.
No, I don't.
You'll just owe me a little favour.
And you can start
by taking these to accounting.
- Jesper...
- A deal with Stenlose municipality.
If you send them an invoice,
I'll close the deal on Monday.
- But Stenlose is Lars' client.
- Elin, no one is anybody's client.
It's a free market.
- Did you lose weight?
- Perhaps.
I can tell. You're becoming
quite the desirable woman.
If fate hadn't put us a decade apart,
we'd have a couple of kids by now.
See you at the Friday drink, Elin.
Lars speaking.
Hello, Fiona.
May I call you back?
Great.
Okay, bye.
- Fiona? A new girl?
- Straight out of the factory.
- We're having some couples over.
- That sounds nice.
Your attention, please.
Folks...!
Yet again we've reached our goal
of being the no. 1 IT company.
And as you know,
our salesmen compete on contracts.
And...
I'm getting a little weary -
- of always
calling the same name.
We all know who it is:
Jesper Jensen!
Jesper, join me.
- Here you go, my boy.
- Thank you.
The rest of you
should get in the game.
If I were him, I wouldn't
be able to live with myself.
He has no moral reservations.
He couldn't care less.
I'm amazed that director Steiner
doesn't see it.
If it maximized the numbers,
he'd blow every stockholder.
So we're negotiating...
These social company gatherings
are great.
So is your interest in the employees.
It enhances mutual respect.
After all, one should
be able to live with oneself.
So, I wonder why anyone would say
you blow the stockholders for profits.
Have a nice weekend.
Did you see that Globecom is
looking for a key account manager?
No, I didn't.
It's on the internet. I think
I'll apply. It's a dream position.
For you, obviously.
It's tough to be the eternal second.
Give me a break. Listen, I'll drive
my car home, and then take off -
- so be a pal and remember
to empty my mail box this time.
- Did you remember the Mascarpone?
- What?
Did you buy Mascarpone?
No, I didn't.
We agreed on Mascarpone
for Italian dishes.
- Use cream.
- I've been waiting for 1 1/2 hour.
Jesper, would you mind
waiting till they get here?
- Tom 's new girlfriend is called Tanja.
- I know.
It's not the one from last time.
This one's called Tanja.
I get it!
Hi!
Hello, Marianne.
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- What do you mean?
I told you that Tom's dad
lost both legs to diabetes.
So, asking him if he wanted
to play golf was just brilliant.
But it was funny when I told him
that at least he knows his handicap.
Not a single person laughed.
- It' s no big deal.
- Jesper, I'm so tired of you.
Don't we have any cranberry juice?
I want a vodka cranberry.
Really tired!
Later, dear.
I'm going out for cranberry juice.
Excuse me.
You're not disabled, are you?
Hey.
Hello...
Hello?
Can you tell me what happened?
- No.
- You were in a traffic accident.
Okay...
I'll just draw a little blood.
Blood?
What for?
Without your license
it just won't work.
I've spoken to a driving instructor,
and he agreed to take me on -
- and let me take the test
as soon as possible.
Yes. There's a job for you
when you return, of course.
Maybe we could tell the others
that I'm on leave.
We'll work something out.
Don't forget
to hand in your key card.
Right.
I read the meter
and I'll pay my share.
That's it then?
You can always call
my dad's lawyer.
Hello, I'm Karen.
Jesper Jensen.
Executive key account manager.
Let's call it what it is,
shall we?
Travelling salesman.
Right?
You were convicted pursuing to
section 53 of the Road Traffic Act -
- and have subsequently
seen our counsellor.
She found you eligible
for community service.
So, Monday at 7 you start work
at a recycling station.
Let's call it what it is: A dump site.
- We don 't call it that.
- Well, I do. And no thank you.
Excuse me?
I say no thank you.
I won't be one of those blue men
rearranging other people's crap.
Two things:
First of all,
this is not a prize.
You've been convicted of DUI, and if
you don't want community service -
- there is an alternative called jail.
And I don't think
you want that.
And secondly:
The 'blue men' you're referring to...
They're not blue...
... they're orange.
And believe you me.
I'll be watching you.
Follow me.
Welcome.
I hope you'll feel at home here.
Don't worry, she's not hitting on you.
Lotte plays for the wrong team.
Handball, button rubbing
and all that crap.
Okay, Doris.
What's your last name?
Doris! Can you hear me?
Doris?
Jesus Christ, no rock'n roll...
I'm a doctor.
Emergency room...
- Scissors.
- Will she make it?
Step back.
Damn it.
1,2,3.
A,B,C.
7-9-13.
Damn it! Damn it!
Come on!
Come one, live!
Live!
Can you hear me? Stay back, I'm
gonna use viral electro chargers...
I need 55 minimum volts.
Clear.
10 volt!
Give me 44/50
Boogieman!
It's no use. We're losing her.
Come on, girl.
We're losing her.
Hello.
Got no heartbeat.
Work with me, Doris.
Last chance.
Work with me.
She's alive.
You're alive.
Lotte, Lotte...
Thank you, thank you.
Keep it up.
Excuse me.
Could you buy your own bottle?
Yes.
Dion is a jackass.
He loves beer and will end up
as fat as his old man.
- He's got bigger tits than you.
- But mine don't sag as much.
Bloody good thing he has a chain
guard on his bike. Otherwise...
Hey, stop that.
Find an other tone, damn it!
For crying out loud, dad.
- I'm telling you for the last time!
- Yes.
Keep to the right,
when it's an even number.
- And to the left, when it's uneven.
- Right.
It's not neuroscience, just remember
that even numbers contain vowels.
One... two...
Would you turn on the water, please?
And FYI. We have a no tolerance
alcohol policy on the site.
It's too dangero...
What the hell is he doing?
Hey! Take it easy.
Calm down, it's just a game.
- Racist pig.
- What?
- Shut you're ass.
- Cool it.
Shut up or die!
- What's going on?
- Yes, what's going on?
Time to hit the showers!
For me.
What the hell's with you?
Unbelievable!
Parking on
a continuous white line!
No, that's a bad...
That's not a PVC pipe.
God damn it! Hey!
Hey! You there...
He's a little stressed out.
We may shut down.
There are two recycling stations,
and the least efficient will be closed.
It's pure cost-benefit.
Yeah, but we need our jobs.
And it's a bitch to constantly
be checked inside and out.
That doesn't look too healthy.
Yeah, drink Light instead.
Shit, during the thunderstorm, the
amount of precipitation was 60 mm.
- No wonder it was so loud.
- That's got nothing to do with it!
'Got nothing...'
- The rain doesn't make it loud.
- Yes, it does!
- The rain?
- Can we agree that thunder is loud?
Yes, from electrical chargings
between the clouds.
I'm gonna need you to repeat that.
Electricity and thermic heat.
Cold and hot air.
- Textbook stuff.
- Give me a break.
Cold and hot air colliding
doesn't make loud noises.
The noise is from the cloud bursting,
and the rain is the water falling out.
- That's why they call it cloud burst.
- No, it really isn't!
If you blow air into a paper bag
and do like this...
It goes bang,
and then take a good look at it.
- It burst, right?
- Definitely, Dion.
It would be great,
if she had bought that.
'Bursting clouds', Jesus!
Any fool knows that the noise is
from lightning striking the ground.
I hate this!
So you'll need to pass
another driving test.
- Night classes?
- Yes.
I'm actually considering
night classes, too.
10th grade?
No, more along the lines of...
Philosophy or photography.
I have tickets for Thai boxing,
if you wanna join me. It's like...
Strange how good they are
considering their tiny Thai eyes.
Small cracks that only see straight
ahead, so if you bend your knees...
Finally, a male student.
Women and clutches is a lousy combo
right after lunch.
- This one girl is on her 54th lesson.
- Sounds expensive.
She has agreed
to pay me with her goods.
I do a little rear ending.
- Did you remember sunglasses?
- No.
So, night driving is out, then.
- Hey, hey...
- Hi, Lars.
What's going on?
I return home,
and hear that Dorte moved out.
I go to work,
and you're on leave.
- Yes.
- Yes, what?
- I'm counting on your discretion.
- Sure.
I told Steiner
the leave was for resting.
- I'm going into business for myself.
- Okay.
I'm sweeping the market, doing
some analyses, and then we'll see.
If it doesn't work out, I can always
return to the company.
If I get the Globecom position,
I wonder what Steiner will do.
- Hell, yes...
- And Dorte?
- Dorte?
- Yes.
- I had to make a decision.
- How did she take it?
She was upset in the beginning,
but...
- So, it's back on the market for you.
- Yeah, maybe.
You should join me on a date
with Fiona and her friend.
Yes, sure.
But I gotta... go shower.
Can't you tell the time?
It's 7.20!
I realize you're not accustomed to
dedicated goal oriented employees -
- but certainly you'll concede
to a certain flexibility.
Fancy word's that I don't understand,
but I got the point.
- That's not my way.
- Okay.
Look up human resource management
and the term 'flex hours'.
We have only one kind of flex hours:
Being on time!
- Get into your boiler suit ASAP!
- Okay, but...
Does that sign say 'knitting club'?
I don't think so!
Suit up, or I'll make a call, and then
it's no more community service.
You'll do hard time with people
who are a lot less friendly.
Are you going
to the Green Concert?
That says it all, then.
Do you know what makes
a dog sound like c cat?
No.
You deep-freeze it, take it out
and cut it with a buzz saw: Meow!.
And how do you make
a cat sound like a dog?
Drench it in petrol
and light a match:
Woof!
Okay, that was new.
And, how do you make a cat...
What?
How do you make
a cat sound like a chicken?
I don't know.
You deep-freeze it, take it out
and hit it on the counter:
Gok-gok-gok.
And how do you make a worm...
- Volkswagen!
- What the hell?
You hit someone and say Volkswagen,
when you see a beetle.
I'm sorry about
the controversy this morning.
You have your rules,
and I apologize.
All is forgiven.
May I leave early today?
- No, but you may sort out the rugs.
- Okay...
I know you have your ways
around here.
But why don't you ask people
to drop off linoleumin combustible?
It's an oil based material
and will be incinerated anyway.
I'd call it Sisyphean labour.
Am I holding a knitting needle?
Am I doing this?
That's how it is
and always has been.
How nice,
we should do this more often.
I'm planning a garden party -
- and I'd love to watch you two
sip wine and show a little leg.
- When?
- I'll let you know.
Pass!
Did you apply to Globecom?
Yes, but Jesper is taking the big leap
and starting on his own.
- I love a man with drive.
- I'm taking my clients with me.
- Of course, a client...
- May I help you?
- Hi!
- Dion?
- Hey, buddy!
- Hi.
- So, what's up.
- Cosy. I'm here with the family.
Join us, if you want. We have
the White Beers that were on sale.
We were just about to...
- Don't hog the ball. Hello.
- My dad. Join us if you feel like it.
Sure.
- See you, Jesper.
- Absolutely. Not.
- Who was that, Jesper?
- Old school mate.
What an unfortunate character.
School mates tend to think
they're close to you.
Pass...
Super tackle!
Pick that up.
Right...
Compared to the other site,
this is a mess.
Damn! We're surrounded.
What the hell are we gonna do?
Listen to me, soldier.
Calm down. Pull yourself together.
- Listen. I'll have you covered. Okay?
- Okay.
I'm staying here, and you try
and force through enemy lines.
- Yeah!
- And I'll cover you, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
But who's gonna cover you?
- You're gonna die!
- So be it.
Go, kid. Go!
How nice that your employees
get to play war.
When they're
not on a break, that is.
This is moronic. The only efficient
thing here is the wireless.
Now that you mention efficiency...
I'm gonna stop
dumping the linoleum over there.
- It's oil based...
- I know.
It might as well go
straight into combustible.
No point in sorting it
before incineration.
That sounds too smart for your brain.
The routine here is ridiculous!
- Theodor?
- Did I ask you to speak?
- I'm not talking to you.
- Don't talk unless spoken to, kid.
- You arrogant son of a bitch.
- Outside! Right now.
It's one phone call away, Jesper!
One phone call.
What an idiot!
And as I've told you many times,
you need to tidy up all the metals.
It's a huge mess.
And it's not up for debate!
Right, uh...
I know you're pissed off about
Varberg, but he knows your story.
Whether the call to your parole officer
comes from him or me doesn't matter.
And he can be so obnoxious,
as you saw, so...
I thought it a good idea
for you to cool off a little.
Right.
See you tomorrow.
Your attention, please.
We have a joint decision to make
about the summer party.
Do we spend all the coffee money
or save some for next time?
- There is no next time.
- Shut up, Dion!
We don't know that, Dion!
Thank you, Lotte.
So, should we spend it all?
Yes, and let's invite
our better halves.
- Very good, Dion.
- Then I get to see Lotte's girlfriend.
So, you wanna see her?
Yeah, I m dying to see what
a steam roller like that looks like.
Lesbians can be feminine too,
right Jesper?
People insecure about their sexual
inclinations tend to be homophobic.
I've never been homo-anything!
Can we stay on track for a minute?
Who's in favour?
- Two. And you, Jesper?
- I abstain.
- What does that mean?
- He won't vote.
Why not?
- I'm busy that day.
- We didn't set a date yet.
- I think I'll be busy.
- Then, I want his vote.
It doesn't work that way, Dion.
- We spend all of it and with partners.
- Yes. Yes! Party time.
Inclination... Give me a break.
I'm considering art history.
Sounds exciting.
The artist expressing
his emotions through -
- copperprint, lithography, weaving
and other means of expression.
Like, if I see lithography from...
... the Lindenberg Collection -
- I can't look at it without
completely breaking apart inside.
- The melancholia...
- What?
You wouldn't understand.
Long word.
Actually, I do. I went to school with a
girl who suffered from melancholia.
Everyday after lunch
she threw up.
It can kill you, you know, so maybe
you shouldn't make fun of it.
Not everybody's born with a silver
spoon in their bed of roses, you know.
- Please.
- Hi.
Cheers.
Hello.
Did you have trouble finding it?
You're late as hell.
- Funny!
- Grab a glass.
- From the shoulder blade...
- And all the way down.
There are more meetings
and paperwork.
- And Elin brewed a lot of coffee.
- Yes.
Alexandra, this is Steiner.
And Elin.
Hello.
- Jesper, whom you already know.
- Hi.
- How's your new company doing?
- New company?
- What's she talking about.
- Nothing, Steiner.
Come on!
It's quite clever.
Jesper is starting a business with
clients from his old work place.
Alexandra, there's a drink
with your name on it at the bar.
- Please explain.
- She misunderstood.
Of course, I'm not
taking any clients.
I'm just restructuring the client base
according to regional criteria.
That's true. I recently moved Stenlose
municipality to Jesper's file.
- That's all there is to it.
- Be quiet, Elin.
- A misunderstanding...
- Hang on, I need to understand this.
Stenlose is my client.
Are you stealing my clients?
No, I'm not stealing your clients!
Elin, It's not...
Are you starting a company?
Elin.
- Are you starting a company?
- Steiner...
Is that a yes or a no?
You make me lie about your DUI,
and then bloody stab me in the back.
You're finished at ITS Infocom, and
you can understand why, can't you?
Who the hell do you think you are?
I thought we were friends!
- Lars, wait...
- You really stink.
Good bye.
I am singing a song
about me about me
The cutest and best little boy- mouse
And the world it revolves
around me around me
and that just makes me...
happy
- Good morning. Theodore sent me.
- I came along just in case.
Are you okay?
No.
My life collapsed yesterday.
What now?
Did you always like girls?
Yes.
How did your parents react?
My dad didn't say much.
We don't talk.
- He won't accept it.
- And your mother?
My mother is very ill.
She has...
Volkswagen!
- What the hell are you doing, Dion?
- It was a beetle!
You moron!
- Relax. Nothing happened.
- Pull over.
I know you're almost done here
and will return to your good job...
I'm sorry
I didn't show this morning.
- Yesterday, I...
- Fine, Jesper.
It's ridiculous
to throw you out at this late date.
But next time, you're out.
And I mean that.
I expect you to respect us,
as we respect you.
- Be on time and make an effort.
- Yes.
My life didn't turn out
exactly as I had expected.
That's just how it is sometimes.
Trust me, I know.
Sometimes you just have to grin
and bear it.
Okay.
- What did he say?
- Not much. He was fair enough.
- So, you're staying.
- Yes.
I gotta take a shit.
- What did he say?
- Not much. He gave me a warning.
I've gotten a few of those.
Did he yell and curse?
No.
That 's the worst.
It makes it hard to read him.
If he's shouting,
you know what he'll do.
- I remember one time...
- We should get started.
Right... yes.
Hey, Lotte!
What's up, bitch?
Why do you homos take so long?
Confused about no. 1 and 2?
Can't tell one from the other?
Oops...
Or hi...
- Where do blinds go?
- Combustible, if it's wood.
Metals, if it's aluminium.
Hi.
- Hi, and thank you.
- You're welcome.
You have a lot of waste.
- Oh, you noticed?
- We notice these things.
- What people throw out.
- Okay.
- So what did she throw out lately?
- That woman?
- I'll have to pass on that.
- So, it's just me.
No, honestly. It's just that I've seen
you and your boyfriend around here.
He's just a friend who's helping me
clear out the basement.
- That should keep you up to date.
- Let me get that for you.
Is it just me,
or do you smell of liqueur?
- I got a little drunk yesterday.
- On a Monday?
I'm quite the rebel. I sometimes eat
my Saturday candy on Friday.
I'm Jesper.
If you ever need a hand, just ask
for the guy in the orange boiler suit.
Yes, okay.
We have a situation.
Use code 4. Come in Orson.
Description: Tall dwarf in leather
jacket and the Malaysian connection.
Operation Hot Chicks is...
... temporarily aborted.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Moving to 20-0-10.
Orson, code 4.
I see you.
If you watch the road,
I'll look out for the ladies.
Both hands on the wheel
positioned 10 to 2.
I've always been crazy about women,
and they've always had a thing for me.
I don't know why.
But I have a pretty good idea.
Just straight through
the intersection.
In Poland you get a hooker for
150 zloty, and you can crap on her.
- No!
- Yes, yes.
It's not really a turn-on for me,
but they charge you to use the toilet -
- so you may as well kill
two birds with one stone.
Damn, look at that one.
Damn!
- Only a lazy bastard wouldn't...
- Please shut up.
I don't care
for your feeble-minded crap.
I see.
Don't forget that I can postpone
your test just like that.
- Volkswagen!
- What the hell was that?
Every time you see a beetle,
you may hit someone.
Really?
Okay, that's actually a fun idea.
Seeking : Key Account Manager
She probably shits with the door open
and pulls out spikes with her pussy.
Jesper!
Yeah!
Uh... nice job
in the dirt and concrete section.
I'll start Lotte on...
the clothes container.
Theodor Joergensen, hello.
What?
But I'm at work.
But...
I'll come and get him,
but it's damn...
Get it out of the way, dammit,
before it takes root.
And then go and...
Jesper, look after things.
I have to pick up my son.
- Sure.
- I'll be right back.
Damn it!
I didn't know he had a son.
- So, Lotte's girlfriend...
- Ah, put a sock in it, Dion.
Entschuldigen Sie.
Wo sollen diese Klamotten hin?
What?
Alte Klamotten.
Diese Klamotten
mochten wir abgeben.
- Alte Klamotten!
- Hallo. Hallo, Alte Klamotten.
Hallo, hallo.
Wolfsburg, Hansa Rostock.
Borussia Monchengladbach!
You hide behind your language.
Leverkusen, Hertha Berlin.
This will be your demise.
Durch, fur, gegen
ohne, wieder, um.
Kannst du nicht Akkusativ
dann bist du wirklich dum.
Do you need help, Lotte?
Konnen Sie uns vielleicht hilfen?
- Ja, klar. Gebt mal her.
- Danke.
- Bitte, tschuss.
- Tschuss.
- Tschuss?
- Yes.
I could take a German class.
Or Japanese.
Excuse me?
I don't know where this goes.
You must sort that yourself.
I pay top-bracket tax,
which ought to cover your salary.
You paying top-bracket tax
is completely irrelevant.
Everybody pays a nominal tax to
public services such as this one.
- He's right.
- Aha.
Get going, okay?
Let's go in.
That's Lotte, Dion and Jesper.
Right.
This is my son, Karsten, and
he'll be here for the rest of the week.
What, Dion?
Karsten will join us, because his
workshop is closed due to sickness.
I've thrown a pair of Kansas on him,
so that he can assist you, Jesper.
Hello, Jesper.
- Dion, carry on.
- With my break?
Shut up, Dion.
Lotte, you come with me.
Dion, get cracking.
Would you like to be her boyfriend?
- What?
- She looks fine.
She looks fine?
- I'll take her.
- You and me both.
Okay.
Then I'll go ask her out.
- We'll wait here.
- Yeah, we'll wait here.
- Hi.
- Hi.
There's this great restaurant
in the park, do you know it?
Great food and a really nice place,
where you can sit outside.
Perhaps you'd care to
go there with me sometime?
You ask me out
even though we're total strangers?
Yes.
Or maybe that was a bit too smart.
Or somewhat...
I'm sorry.
I'd love to.
Okay!
So, what do we do?
- I don't have any plans tonight.
- Me neither.
- It's a date, then?
- Yes.
Okay, see you.
- Jesper?
- Yes?
Shall we say at 7?
Yes, of course.
- See you then.
- See you.
So...
Karsten is doing great.
- Why wouldn't he?
- I don't know, he just is.
And that's strange because
he's mentally challenged? A...
- He's got a better head than most.
- Theodor! That's not what I meant.
No. Karsten just needs boundaries,
and that's my responsibility.
I probably bring it to work sometimes,
and appear a little rigid.
No one finds you
uptight and rigid.
- Ah, shut up.
- Okay, maybe a little.
Why did you say uptight?
I didn't.
Did I?
- I'm sure I didn't.
- I don't think I'm uptight.
No!
No, I don't think I said...
I'd better get started on
moving these fridges.
I mean, you've seen the boiler suits.
The colour alone is really something.
The first time I met Dion,
he was telling these endless jokes.
That was a bit much,
when I first came to the site.
You know...
But they're really nice people.
You've told me about you co-workers.
What should I know about you?
I was just dumped
from a long-term relationship.
She was just...
Girls are a bit strange sometimes,
you know...
Basically, she left
because I treated her badly.
I was a real asshole.
You sure know
how to sweet-talk a girl.
Well, I am a salesman.
You may be an asshole, but there's
a really nice guy attached to it.
How poetic.
This is where I live.
Oh.
- I'd better be getting on home, then.
- I guess so.
Isn't it cold out there?
Yes.
Yeah?
I didn't make it.
You will live by your heart
if you only give up thinking
Give it up, never stop
and you feel everything
You will live by your heart
if you only give up thinking
Give it up, never stop
and you'll feel everything
No!
It's all wrong, Lotte.
- I'm right, and that's a fact.
- No, it isn't, Dion!
- GNP means: Gross national product.
- Yes...
The product most exported,
and that is farming!
- 'Gross' means...
- That is livestock, grain, barely...
- 'Gross' means all Danish production.
- Fur!
Don't debate him.
He's completely ignorant.
Thank you, Jesper!
Pardon the interruption, but what
do I do with this old broom.
Stick her in a senior centre.
- I'm sorry, I don't understand.
- Just leave her.... uh it outside.
Thank you.
I know you're done now,
but how about a round?
A round?
Like this.
And then you block here.
Who have we here?
Welcome!
- I thought drinking was banned.
- It's al most closing time.
We play charades.
Watch mama's magic.
This is a good one.
Tits.
- A man?
- Yes.
Anger, angry...
Do you need to take a dump?
- Theodor, damn it!
- Theodor! Right!
Kissing!
Ass!
Theodor kisses ass...
... on...
Varberg!
- Theodor kisses Varberg's ass!
- How hard was that?
- You're up, Jesper.
- Okay.
A man's dick is his sceptre.
- Carl- Mar!
- More!
The woman should be spanked
with the man's big dick.
Man has a big dick,
and it is God.
She must worship his dick.
He has powder bags at the root.
It must be emptied by the woman
at least once a day.
She must caress it
and cuddle it.
She must obey!
She's a cheap slut!
After only one dinner,
he's invited into her apartment.
She rolls over like a cheap bitch,
and prepares to receive his dick.
He fucks the little bitch
with his big hard dick.
He penetrates her
and fucks her hard, the little slut.
He dick-slaps her in the face
and gives her a...
Hi.
Don't ever call me again.
Sofie!
Sofie!
- I'm so sorry!
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm sorry, but I have to...
- God damn it!
Theodor! Jesper!
Sofie!
- Do something!
- Jesper, do something!
Come on!
I'll definitely take legal action.
It's a Bertoni suit. Theodor!
Ouch, damn it!
Did they find my computer?
They're searching. You don't recall
where you left it, do you?
I was scolded by a guy
with a dangling dick!
I'm losing my focus!
I need my computer now, Theodor!
Yes.
Dion, more paper!
Go help them find the computer,
for Christ's sake!
I found it.
Here you go.
Every single rule
has been broken here.
- You have a mongolian on the loose.
- Hey! He is not a Mongolian.
I don 't care what type of retard he is.
You all have shit for brains.
Remove that dick, please.
The municipality will be in touch.
Take off that dick.
So, Jesper, this is the last day
before starting your new job...
I'm glad you decided
to come to the party.
- Closing party.
- That hasn't been settled yet, Dion.
Anything can happen.
Okay, let's go.
Dion, come on.
Did you call Sofie?
- Yes, no... not yet.
- Oh?
- She said to never call her again.
- Women say stuff like that.
- Really?
- I think you should call her.
Good luck with your new job.
And I'll...
Thanks, Lotte.
So, Jesper, let's get started.
We actually decided on Lars from ITS
Infocom, but your CV is impressive.
I expect great things and look forward
to seeing your portfolio -
- and every month
the best salesmen gets a prize, so...
Happy hunting!
- Sofie speaking.
- Sofie?
It's Jesper.
Please, let me explain.
- You just walked out of there?
- Yes.
- So, you won't be a salesman?
- Sure, but not like that.
Someone sure is embracing
the flex hours.
Relax, they're on their way.
I can't wait to see Lotte's girlfriend.
A lesbian isn't necessarily
ugly or repulsive, sweetie.
- Here they come.
- Finally!
Hi! Jesper.
Hi, Lotte.
Good to see you.
Hi, Karsten.
- Jane.
- Lotte.
I'm damned sorry I'm late.
Hey babe.
- Hello.
- Hello. Jesper.
Hanna, hi. They have great food here.
I know the chef, he's a queer.
I think one of the waiters is gay,
so mind what you order.
- Why?
- The Creme brulee may be suspect.
- Let' s go inside and have a drink.
- Standing here won't get us drunk.
Sweetie, why don't we put
a quota on the schnapps tonight.
Good evening, I'm Lennart,
and I'll be serving you tonight.
Hey, hey.
Listen up.
Before I get too drunk,
I have a few things to tell you.
- I have good news and bad.
- We're not shutting down!
The bad news is
that we're shutting down.
Well, the writing was on the wall.
But the good news is...
Varberg has recommended us
for jobs in the technical department.
- How the hell did that happen?
- I'll read you the recommendation.
Listen.
Regarding discontinuation
of the recycling station.
As the municipal rationalization
is based on cost-benefit analyses -
- I recommend that we,
from a human resource point of view -
- rehire the affected employees
elsewhere in the municipality.
I'd never expect that
of Varberg.
He recognizes a good team,
when he sees one.
- Cheers!
- Absolutely.
- Cheers.
- Congratulations.
Hooray for us.
A strong team.
- Why didn't you call me sooner?
- You said to never call you again.
You must sense what I feel,
not hear what I say.
- That can be difficult.
- I never said it was fair.
- But I liked you as a pageboy.
- What?
- With the dangling sock.
- How about an encore, then?
- This time without an audience.
- Ah, you girls and all your rules.
Yes, girls are a bit strange, right?
Stop!
The meteor is coming.
Fear not.
Lotte will save the world.
Houston, we have a problem.
This is gonna sting.
Yippee.
Jesper and Sofie now share a home.
Jesper is painting the nursery.
Lotte has seen a UFO twice.
The police, however, say that
the tire tracks tell a different story.
- What the hell's with you?
- Are you talking to me?
Theodor took
an anger management class.
The court later ruled
that the teacher hit first.
Dion and Jane have had
their second set of twins.
Dion is now sterilized.
