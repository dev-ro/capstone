Don't worry, Sir.
We're getting you out.
Don't switch as in a moment
M. Durriot minister of State
wiII address the Nation.
M. Durriot addresses you.
Ah, keep it on for me...
Citizens, the state of the nation is bad.
Tonight I wiII be taIking to you
of that government to which I beIong,
asking it to uphoId that
responsibiIity that it hoIds toward you,
the voters,
and I am taIking
even to our members residing abroad
because of some dipIomatic duty.
It is cIear, through aII the reports
I have been anaIyzing through the
course of these Iast few months,
aIas, that they come to compIete a
negative picture of our efforts,
and I am therefore asking for
a new course of action.
As a beIiever in Europe,
I haven't given up the hope of seeing us
French give up the superfIuous
to come together so that,
having united,
we might aII get the essentiaI.
The Iatest statistics point out that
our imports surpass our exports
of severaI biIIions.
To fight InfIation
is therefore necessary...
...and Mrs. Chirot in the car
with Monsieur Presson.
Madame Girot in the car
with Mr. ReynoIds.

Just a second.

Which car shouId we both take,
CoIoneI?
Nobody has caIIed out our names.
HuIot.

What's happening,
CoIoneI?
Don't worry.
Everything's been methodicaIIy organized,
you're in M. HuIot's car.
But he's not there,
what are we going to do?
Ah! You can have my seat if you Iike.
I'II go with Monsieur HuIot.
I'm sorry to disturb you.
Ex cuse me.
No, no, no.
Important caII from Hamburg.
...no more formuIas...
...capitaIism is made
of too many words.
Here we go.
Come aIong Mrs. Dubois you sit in the front
and I'II sit in the back.
Direction...
right.
No, the preserves go over there.
Dessert.
Put it there.
In this sort of weather
you appreciate
an open car,
wouId you agree?
O Iook...
That church is reaIIy 'a very pretty picture'
as you say in EngIish
and I hadn't noticed...
and aII this green...
A perfect setting for a hoIiday...
Is it not?
What's up?
-Did you see?
-Yes.
Ah, but I was up
and I was down.
Ah, at Iast. We're off again.
It's not too Iate.
[ Skipped item nr. 215 ]
Stop, stop...
Yes, I do hear you.
No, not a seven, sixteen wagons.
Right.
No, it's not expensive.
This is not acceptabIe, this is a madhouse.
-Oh, I must say goodbye to Mrs. Dubois.
-AII right.
-Let's Ieave the bags here.
-Yeah. Okay.
Thank you dear Lady.
I hope I wiII see you in Paris.
Here you go Miss.
It wouId be a pIeasure.

My journey over was horribIe,
the heat frightfuI.
