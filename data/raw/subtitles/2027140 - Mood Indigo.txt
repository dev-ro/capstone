Places, everyone, please!
- Thank you!
- Out of the way!
Colin was finishing washing.
Don't get it everywhere. You might slip.
Another 30 minutes. Now focus on the eel.
Colin had sufficient wealth to live
comfortably without working.
Come into the kitchen.
Let's see what Nicolas is cooking.
I don't fancy being poisoned on such a sunny day.
Remove the first layer of skin.
Do this by making
a small incision
in the belly 2 inches from the head.
Then scald the eel
to remove the second, oily layer...
Hello, Mouse!
How's it looking?
Trickled eel with lithinated cream,
and juniper in tansy leaf pouches.
Don't congratulate me, I'm just following Gouffe.
For the pleasure of Sir and his guest.
Nicolas, please stop speaking in the third person.
That kind of familiarity comes
when you chase girls together.
Sir must know, however, how very fond I am of him.
I give up.
Place in a terrine of cold water
and leave to cool. Drain and...
If you don't keep stirring,
the sweetbreads'll never be tender!
- Stir!
- I can't catch the eel!
The eel!
There it is!
There!
Damn!
I've got it!
Pineapple!
It loves my pineapple toothpaste.
Good idea.
We'll lure the beast out.
Baiting won't do. You'll have to hook it.
Meet me at the fridge.
Thank you, Gouffe.
Got it.
- You always amaze me.
- That's called talent.
Scald it.
Too late!
Knock it out with tomatoes and fresh mint.
Thank you, Mouse.
What's Chick up to?
Anesthetized eel with mint.
Imagine his face when he sees my pianocktail!
I bet he's in a bookstore again.
"Bookstore"
plus "Jean-Sol Partre".
I told him I can't dance.
But you taught me the paw-to-paw!
I'm not dancing with an ugly mug like that!
Can I help you?
- What?
- "Bookstore + Partre, Jean-Sol".
A bookstore that sells Partre.
Partre, Jean-Sol. Try Pages Bookstore.
Wait, I'll enter it.
Philosophers' Books.
Little Miss Stationers.
Stir, stir...
Now spice it. Add the spices.
- This one?
- No.
I can't see a thing.
All this kit for nothing.
- How about that?
- No. Here, take this.
Don't say he's still at home.
"Chick Troskniovmatovski,
Avenue Ecuyer".
- Stir.
- OK.
Enter.
There's Chick.
Look, look! You see?
In the brown coat.
No way. He's buying another Partre book?
He's got no shame, that boy.
There he is again!
Now he's coming!
I'm going to change.
You're changing too?
No, the red one.
Very nice.
OK, I get it!
Ouch!
It didn't suffer.

Hey, Chick!
I must return your doormat.
- You OK?
- Never mind that.
Quick, come and see my pianocktail!
- Is it hotting up?
- You never know.
Is this your new chef?
My lawyer and mentor.
He cooks to relax. He's a disciple of Gouffe.
My master...
Stop it, Nicolas.
Come on, Chick.
Lovely to meet you, Mr. Mystery Chick.
- Mr. Mystery?
- No, Mr. E. Chick.
His style can be convoluted. Time for a drink!
So your piano works?
Ocktail! Pianocktail!
Your pianocktail, I mean.
Beyond my wildest dreams.
I got amazing results with
"Black and Tan Fantasy".
Each note triggers a spirit, liqueur or flavor.
Very complicated.
Yes, very, very,
very complicated.
No, let me do it!
Let me try "Caravan", please!
Can I start?
Go on, then.
- Is it working?
- Yes.
The quantities vary with the chords.
You get a nostalgic taste from minor chords,
and an optimistic one from majors.
And a touch of Calvados.
Take it easy!
Chick, easy on the loud pedal. It's beaten egg.
If the tune's too hot, you get omelet.
Bear it in mind.
- A few bum notes.
- Two or three personal ones.
- A question of taste...
- No.
Nicolas's amazing. It looks really unusual.
You look unusual, too. Like you're happy.
I met someone.
A girl.
What's she like?
She's... I don't know.
She's pretty.
Dammit! Is she American?
No. She's called Alise.
We met at a Partre conference.
Lying under the stage.
That makes things easier!
- She's into Partre too?
- Yes.
I knew it.
Every time I said anything, she said, "Me, too".
So I tried an experiment and said, "I like you".
What did she say?
She said, "Oh", like that.
The experiment failed, then.
Sure. But she hung around.
- How'd you leave it?
- It was nearly bedtime so...
Shared passion as a way in? It's a bit lazy.
Isn't it, Nicolas?
It's a bit delicate.
Your friend's young acquaintance is my niece, Sir.
How do you know it's the same Alise?
Alise already told me she met Mr. Chick.
- There's innumerable Chicks!
- Numerable.
And their accounts tally almost exactly.
You have a very pretty niece.
Enough! You never told me and now she's taken!
I'm sorry, Sir.
I have 2 other nieces Sir could meet.
As pretty as Alise?
Only a connoisseur could say.
Perfect. We just need the right context.
Yes. Just a moment.
Let me check my schedule.
I'm busy on the 27th.
A lecture. I can cancel it.
Yes, the Ponteauzanne's party!
For lsis's poodle, Dupont.
- You know lsis de Ponteauzanne?
- Very well.
We are...
I know her well.
I can't believe this.
I'm the only one who's not...
This feeling of solitude is dreadful!
I demand to fall in love, too!
Do your nieces have passions?
I can try Chick's technique.
Yes. They dance the biglemoi.
There you go!
That'll bring us closer.
Yes, Duke Ellington.
Perfect. I'm on my way.
"Chloe".
The biglemoi is all about
interference from 2 sources,
animated by an oscillation,
in perfect synchronization.
I didn't know it was so technical!
I developed the theory with my brother-in-law
at our Colloge de France meetings.
That's it. Now, come here.
The dancing couple hold each other fairly close.
You adjust the undulation to a slow beat,
so the field is mid-height between the two.
That's it.
Why such a slow beat?
Because any faster, a boogie-woogie, say,
the effect soon becomes obscene.
With practice, you can create parasitic waves
that make some limbs vibrate individually.
You'll get that with a partner.
You're doing very well, Mr. Colin.
Six o'clock?
Chick will probably be there already.
The gift for Isis!
Isis de Ponteauzanne...
That's enough!
Wait!
Thanks so much!
Hello, Colin.
How are you?
Happy birthday.
It's not mine, it's Dupont's.
Oh yes. Your poodle.
No, he's a Jack Russell.
He's been groomed for the party.
Combed him for hours,
then 3 pals with a bone arrive and he's off.
He'll come back in a state. He's been gone ages.
Here.
What is it?
It's wonderful!
He'll love it! Thanks!
And here he is!
Here's my darling little Dupont!
Look what Colin brought you!
Say thank you! Go on.
Think nothing of it.
What a lovely dress.
Can I touch without being bitten?
Try it and see.
Sorry. It always makes me do that.
- Some champagne perhaps?
- Yes.
It's the only copy, the original, and it's mine!
Colin! How are you?
Great to see you.
Colin's my best friend.
Alise, who is also Nicolas's niece.
Your uncle's incredibly embodied.
I'd be lost without him.
Nicolas...
He's the pride of the family.
My mother never got over only marrying a judge,
whereas her brother has done so well in life.
I was right! She is American!
I knew it! You talk with that spongy accent.
- She's not American.
- Yes I am.
I am American. I was born and
raised in lssy-les-Moulineaux.
Very funny.
Nicolas must have nieces in the USA.
Are you coming tomorrow?
I made a piece of furniture like this
with tracks round it. It serves cocktails.
Harmonic cocktails!
Really bad idea. We're not coming. I know you.
- You'll pianocktail her.
- Nonsense!
It's not nonsense.
You need to find one
so you're two and we make four.
Go on. Good luck.
- Her maybe?
- No, not her.
Her in the green?
She's not so smart.
Introduce me to her.
Yes, she's great.
Chloe?
This is Colin. Colin, Chloe.
Chloe
Ever been played by Duke Ellington?
You're leaving without dancing with me?
No. I did something dumb.
Screwed up my joke. I have to go.
My ears are burning.
Because of Chloe?
- You know her?
- Pretty, isn't she?
Adorable.
Come on.
Take a look at this.
I said that because "Chloe" is...
also a piece by Duke Ellington.
Duke Ellington, the famous racing driver.
Of course. I feel very stupid.
Can I please leave?
Can you please stay?
Sure, but I'm silly, aren't I?
- OK, but I am, too.
- Not as much as me.
My ears are red.
Well, my hands are frozen.
Frozen hands aren't silly.
- Oven-baked snack?
- No thanks, Isis.
Your mistake. They're lovely.
What's wrong?
A hedgehog spine!
Spit it out. It's dangerous.
Here. Go ahead, I won't look.
Here.
This'll help.
Can I have my hankie?
What's wrong with him?
He can't drink!
Are you OK?
Yes, of course.
Yes!
Nicolas is here! We can dance the biglemoi!
Hi!
This is Duke Ellington.
It's my pleasure to introduce to you...
some of the great music.
It is our band record in New York.
We want you to know, we do love you.
I think he wants us to dance the biglemoi to me!
It's not my thing.
It's not mine, either.
What?
Well it is, but I didn't ask right.
No, it's my fault...
I think I missed my chance.
To be honest, I learned the biglemoi
just for this party.
I'm just bumbling around.
Even better. Let's bumble together.
Come on!
- Dance!
- I don't have the body for it.
- Of course you do.
- No.
DINNER IS SERVED!
When are you seeing her again?
Who says I'm seeing her again?
She's a very special girl.
She'd had a lot of champagne.
She might not even recognize me in daylight.
You're elegant and original.
Stop worrying. it'll be fine.
Today I found a pharmaceutical edition
of Partre's "Puking Preliminaries".
- Pharmaceutical?
- Yes. In pill form.
This is Chapter 3. They put 2 in.
Wait.
Relax.
And enjoy, Colin!
Earlier, while descolarizing the hotline vanisher,
I enshrined Lucie who was hanging
for the confederation of insanity,
itself deathly for the patroness.
Well?
- Amazing!
- If you like,
I can get
"Existentialism is Rheumatism" in syrup form.
No thank you!
I'm scared of getting hooked!
I no longer subordinate it.
Nor a backward-looking quintidi.
Lucie, since then,
in keeping with her habits,
sometimes dresses in ruffles,
to re-freeze the patroness.
She parodied without spaces...
What's he publishing now? Five articles a week?
That must cost a fortune.
Twelve!
It's not cheap but, I can stop any time I like.
- Stop right now!
- No.
Partre is about moral commitment.
Come on! You'll ruin your health.
Just walking down the street...
Sure, one has to leave one's house!
I'm both in despair and horribly happy.
How can I see her again?
It's nice to yearn so much.
I'd like to lie in dry grass that
scratches because of the sun,
and is full of insects and stones!
- And Chloe?
- With Chloe, of course.
Nicolas! How do I get to see a girl I'm in love with?
Sir's ears are open again to my voice?
It was the champagne. A side effect. Well?
I advise Sir to endeavor
to badger the person in whose abode
Sir met the other person
whom Sir is currently missing,
for details of
the habits of said person.
Despite the complexity of your words,
you might be onto something.
He is invaluable.
I think that when he was talking about the badger,
he was definitely referring to lsis.
Of course!
It's Nicolas who will fix my fate.
Have some with us, Nicolas.
It would be inadmissible to dine in these clothes.
Then change!
But I insist you eat this cake with us.
I'll get changed!
Nicolas! With us! Nicolas!
Hey, assholes!
At last, you're speaking normally!
I can if I want to.
Let's be informal. Too much form
makes it feel crowded.
I know we still haven't chased girls together.
But with you, it wouldn't be a chase.
lt'd be a sprint.
They're all over him . Like meteorites.
Jean-Sol de Partre! The fragrance!
A date with Chloe, in 2 hours,
in my favourite part of Paris.
In 2 hours!
Favourite part of Paris.
The Eiffel Tower.
The Eiffel Tower's tricky.
Which leg do we meet under?
Versailles.
The Chateau de Versailles.
No, too fusty. She'll think I'm old-fashioned.
The Forum des Halles.
Forum des Halles.
The Forum des Halles. 7,000 shops.
Perfect. Everything we need and very central.
I'll buy her... A thing.
You didn't say it's a construction site.
Les Halles is a hole.
How about the Musee Grevin?
Chloe.
Hi, Colin.
You're a bit clumsy today!
It was better last time.
I'm sorry about the construction.
This Halles hole is back again.
They started work a year ago.
You don't come here much.
You're making fun of me. That's not very nice.
Feeling a bit touchy today?
- Aren't you pleased to see me?
- Sure.
I'm observing the signs.
- I'm being careful.
- Ignore the signs.
You're doing fine.
And I think you're funny.
I've hardly spoken.
Who cares? I love holes. Give me your arm.
Look!
Let's have a go!
The poor crane operator
- must be starving.
- Indeed. Let's go.
What do you have against this song?
I don't like pop hits.
Know why they call it "pop"?
- No. Why?
- I've no idea.
Do you always punch your way to silence?
I only smash songs not called "Chloe".
And ones called "Colin"?
There aren't any.
I can sing one if you like.
That rhymes?
Look!
I love the car but why the nudity?
It's see-through, so you strip?
Like at the pool?
The transparency means you've got nothing to hide.
Nothing to hide? I'm not so sure.
And the brush things?
I guess it's... It's much nicer with your hand.
I don't like boys who say
horrid things in front of girls.
See? I'm not doing so well after all.
Y'know the underground forest?
With the birdcages? Nobody goes there.
Apart from us.
Careful.
Are you OK?
We'll see the birds...
That doesn't rhyme!
Can I tell you something?
That sounds scary.
I feel a weight on my chest. A pressure.
Like my life depends on this moment.
- This moment right now?
- Yes.
- And if I screw up...
- I think the opposite.
There are two of us,
so if we screw up this moment, we try the next
and so on and so forth.
We have our whole lives to get it right.
That was a bit quick!
Six months later...
Hello.
Are you sure those are the right words?
I've forgotten all the words.
My mom wrote that song for me
when I was a little girl.
I don't think she wrote any song.
- Yes, it's her song.
- No...
There are mikes hidden in every room!
- Hello!
- Hello! Nicolas!
It's true!
Nicolas!
You better get your skates on.
We're off to the Molitor rink.
Ice-skating!
Nicolas, if it means such terrible word play,
we'll sail back to formality.
My dear client, we are far off
the coast of informality.
- I like your word games.
- Thanks.
Dear skaters,
sliders and skidettes,
it's time for the contest to catch
Mickey's tail.
The last words
of the winner will be translated
into 27 languages.
Colin!
Look out!
It's OK, I'm fine!
I'm OK!
Ouch!
The winner
is a girl.
Her last words...
It's OK, I'm fine!
...will be translated into 27 languages.
Ouch!
Aie! Au!
- You OK?
- Thanks.
We need to talk.
I don't dare ask for Chloe's hand.
I'm scared she'll say no.
I have a question:
I want to marry Colin
but I'm afraid he's too scared to ask.
What were you saying?
Nothing. They're sulking.
What's up with you two? Today, specifically.
It's Chick. He says he hasn't
got enough money to keep me.
He's ashamed not marrying me.
No, it's not just the money.
Her parents won't agree.
It's a Partrean situation.
How are our finances looking?
Looking rosy. We have 100,000 doublezoons left.
Chick...
Wait for me.
I've 100,000.
You take a quarter to live on.
You keep working. it'll be fine.
One condition.
Ask Chloe to marry you.
If she says yes, I will.
Hey Chloe! Will you...
...marry me?
Yes.
- How many do you need?
- Enough to fill the room.
What volume are we talking?
Very slim. A little twig with big black eyes.
Put her in a full bathtub and it won't overflow.
That's surface tension.
I meant the volume of the room.
Around 300 cubic feet.
Now...
Violet buttercups...
Orange dahlias...
And a big bunch of those red roses.
And loads of those white ones.
- Anemones?
- Yes.
I knew it! That's all.
Wait!
Need a ride?
No thanks. You're a public menace.
Come on.
Then we're all together.
I'm getting married in an hour, you know.
You're not making much progress.
You look lovely.
You should bring the reflections with you.
Can we bring them?
Of course. Colin asked them to come.
And you,
go see what the boys are doing
instead of staring!
Skedaddle!
We don't even know if it's a boy or a girl.
The transparent one, with all the extras.
- No problem.
- See you at the church.
- Is it OK?
- Not really.
Hold still.
That'll do.
Amen.
It'll be a lovely sacremony.
Start the karts instead of blaspheming.
Hold on a minute. Look at that.
You have it already.
Stench
Not bound like that. Wait!
- Buy it later.
- With that binding?
I don't have my wallet.
Thanks, Colin.
Not the statue! Let's leave him here!
Come on!
The book was a tatty copy. They didn't fool me.
Here's the happy couple!
It was a tatty copy! They didn't fool me!
You brought the whole brood along.
Hello, chickens!
In keeping with the new nomenclature of
the Theodocian code,
I'll only marry the winning couple.
What? But it's our wedding.
Take your place in the karts.
Here's our chance!
Come on!
Don't argue, just go!
We can change the whole narrative!
We win, we wed and we're the heroes!
Jetsus!
False start! Should we cancel?
Have you received the entire installment?
I only got the first installment.
Man, what did you do? You got the job to finish.
Hang on!
Turn right, 200 meters.
- Go on, Colin!
- Father,
make me an instrument of your peace.
Where there is injury, let me sow love.
To unify, supply...
and glide by.
Go on, faster! Speed up!
Go, go, go! Great!
Colchick,
will you take Chlolise?
Yes.
Don't be sad.
Lord, hear our prayer,
so they may be happy together,
and safe from family and work.
Chloe... Colin...
Say, are you sure this is the Sunshine Road?
- Are you lost?
- No. I'm following the GPM.
The Sunshine Road has roadworks.
Look in the handbook. There's a rainbow option.
- Here!
- There.
No, no. Go ahead. OK. Be my guest.
- It's my gift.
- Of course.
There we go!
Not this song!
Nicolas
Nicolas, turn it off,
otherwise he'll smash it up.
Nicolas, not this song.
I can't stop it. It comes with the rainbow.
Did you sleep well yesterday?
Last night, I walked lsis home. She made me drink.
Her two cousins were there and wanted me to stay.
They were tipsy. I put them to bed.
The bed was big.
I slept there so as not to wake you.
You slept?
The bed must have been very hard.
You look tired.
The suns are coming back. Listen to the rainbow!
But they're not suns!
Let me guess. It was a good road, smooth,
full of photogenic reflections,
with perfectly cylindrical trees on both sides.
Fresh grass, cows in the fields,
worm-eaten gates, flowering hedges,
apples on apple trees and piles of dead leaves.
And snow here and there,
and for a change, palm trees,
mimosas and northern pines.
And sunshine!
Heavens above!
This picnic's over. Shall we pack it up?
Shall we try this hotel?
I'll see if they have rooms.
- Was it closed?
- No.
I negotiated with the daughter.
Let me guess.
Cover your ears, Chloe.
She insisted, so you obliged.
- No, I negotiated the room rate.
- With your shirt off?
Chloe come here. You'll catch cold.
It's very, very, very, very mixed weather.
Please forgive my clothes,
but negotiations were tight.
What you do is your own business.
It's our honeymoon, right?
Yes. Anything goes.
Chloe, you don't believe all this crap?
Please forgive my language but...
Stop it! You treat her like a pal
and me like a sideboard.
Way to go, champ!
An evening with Jean-Sol Partre
Alise!
The lazy self and the price of gas
Alise!
Come on, we'll go the back way.
It's this way.
The man-sandwich didn't just write...
He's coming! Quick!
You remember?
Of course I remember. This is where we met.
It's the Duchess of Bovouard!
Jean-Sol Partre, you're back from the USA,
to confront the souls of the New World.
What is your personal view
of the American vision of the essential self?
The athletic exocytosis
I reproduce is more repressed.
It only declericalizes
if the difference is unexpatriated.
It has a shelf through which the excerpt
pre-estimates destiny.
The shelf is expatriated prior to
foretelling its release
from concepticism, and this shelf
is the man-sandwich.
Or, as Heidegger would disagree,
the numeral resuscitation
that simplifies...
Don't try to follow. We can play it back later.
By the way, Nicolas called . They're back tomorrow.
- Chloe's not well.
- What's wrong?
She has a pain in her chest.
Where? In her lungs?
I don't know. It hurts in her chest.
Is it serious?
Nicolas didn't say, but...
- Didn't you ask for details?
- No.
You think it's serious?
Listen!
The man-sandwich disembowels
as he concocts himself...
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Jean-Sol Partre has cracked his pipe.
Please make way for him
with caution.
There are 3 frogs on a railway track...
- Where?
- A railway track.
There's 3 frogs on a railway track,
and there's a train coming.
One says: "Look out, it's a... Pfthth!"
- What? Pfthth!
- A... pfthth!
Get it?
Not bad!
It's nice to see you well.
But seriously, you were worried?
I'll slap anyone who worries.
- She ate half the chicken pie!
- Bravo.
I sense a little worry. Or forced relief, maybe.
I'll call Chick and Alise.
Skating, shopping, danceling.
There's a dancette tonight at Bibi's.
Much, much, much, much better.
Yes, a lot, lot...
Is it coming off?
You have to rub so hard?
Stop it. I'll bandage you up.
25, 000 for Chick,
15, 000 for the car,
5,000 for the ceremony.
It's alright.
What's up?
It was cleaning the windows.
The sun doesn't come in like it used to.
Maybe it's just wear and tear.
We'll change them.
Very good. I'll order them from Bhutan.
From Bhutan? Maybe it can wait.
No cooking. Just sandwiches. We're leaving now.
Very good.
Chloe!
Are you OK?
- You were worried!
- No way.
- I wasn't worried.
- You didn't believe her?
- I did at first.
- You be careful!
- I wasn't.
- No?
- No.
- I thought you were.
I thought that...
I wasn't worried, it was him!
I thought you believed it at first.
No, I didn't.
I was worried because I could see you were.
- No.
- Yes!
You were worried at first.
Here we go again!
How are you?
How's it going?
You look well.
Of course I do!
Colin and Nicolas looked after me.
You look lovely.
My cousins kept asking after you.
They're charming, but not as firm as you.
Good. Where do we start?
- We're going skating, aren't we?
- No, shopping first.
- We need dresses.
- And dresses.
Let's meet at the rink?
Yes. We'll be quick so we can skate, too.
It's Partre's Brussels lecture.
The sound's much better.
Let's go skate.
See you later.
- Listen!
- I've already heard it!
- No, you haven't.
- Yes, I have.
Don't do it every time.
And not in front of Chloe...
Just this bit.
The man-sandwich will disembowel first those...
Mr. Colin,
telephone call for Mr. Colin.
I repeat...
Some guy's got your name!
Telephone call for Mr. Colin.
How did it happen?
Did you call the doctor?
I'm on my way!
- Get a beaking move on!
- Chillax!
What's up with her?
She fainted.
Did the skating go smoothly?
How many laps?
It's no big deal.
Oh, sorry.
No big deal at all.
You raced back here.
I'm sorry I scared you. Are you mad at me?
Not at all.
I just trotted back.
It's so quiet.
Shall I put on some music?
- No, it'll tire you.
- I'm fine.
It's me.
So you're not at all, at all, at all
mad at me?
No.
Why? Why would I be?
For marrying me.
Are you sure?
Yes.
How about you?
I'm sure, too.
You see that?
The music's making the room round.
Please don't cough.
Hello, Doctor.
Yes, I'm the doctor.
You're just in time.
Taste this.
Powerful stuff!
Are you OK for the check-up?
My colleague will come to give a second opinion.
Come this way.
It's through here. Go down 3 flights
and then turn right.
Was that him?
He was too young so I got rid of him.
But he's sending a more experienced colleague.
I'll get it this time.
Hello. Dr Mangemanche.
- Hi.
- Sorry I'm late,
I was helping a colleague vomiting on your stairs.
Who else is sick?
My wife. This way.
Careful as you go in. It's round.
- Have you been playing Duke Ellington?
- Yes.
You've had it, too?
Everywhere. You know "Slap Happy"?
You do. Stay there, I'll come up.
How are you?
Past 60, having no pain means
you're probably dead.
- You're not 60.
- No, but I'm getting ready.
Now, what's the trouble?
Chloe has had...
two fainting fits.
One and a half. It's Colin who's worried.
Let's take a look.
She's coughing a lot, too.
13.8 -that's fine.
Can you hear with those little ears?
That's fine.
Perfect.
That's perfect.
A nonsuit is the only outcome
expected from your deliberations,
or I will refer it to the judges for
damages incurred.
Call back if you need to.
This doctor, isn't he a bit...?
Trust me, he's very knowledgeable.
He's dead good!
Don't go on appearances. Look...
I've interwebbed him.
He'd never drop a case if it were...
Serious?
What's she got?
Strange music in her right lung.
Strange music...
I can't follow the rhythm.
You'll need to come to my office for some tests.
Meanwhile, I'll give you some xytrol...
Sorry, I don't prescribe it much
and it's very hard to pronounce.
It's easier to write it.
- Is tomorrow OK?
- Yes.
Come to the clinic. Here's the address.
Here.
Your wife is very beautiful.
But she's in pain.
I feel bad now. Here, let me cheer you up.
Look.
This is my wife.
I knew it. You're all the same.
Beauty isn't everything.
I don't get it. The doc said they'd be open.
Here, take this.
You'll get your meds. Trust Chick.
Neurologyyyy!
- Yes?
- I need this doctor's order executed.
Of course.
What do they eat?
Chromed carrots from the factory.
Colin, look at this manuscript.
It's priceless, unique.
You wouldn't even find it in a place like this.
It's time you married Alise. She must be fed up.
It's just that she hasn't...
- We all have money problems.
- I know.
- How much is left?
- I don't know. 3,200...
Out of 25,000?
No way!
- All spent on Partre?
- Yes.
Why do you ask?
Maybe Alise doesn't care about getting married.
She loves Partre, too. She's content.
Careful. It's dangerous.
Sometimes the rabbit gets carried away.
You have to eliminate it.
Anyway, here is your prescription.
Be careful. It's very powerful.
What does it treat?
Many things.
But an ordinary plant won't survive long.
A plant?
You must respect the stated dose.
I'm not going to leave Alise, you know.
It's not my problem, is it?
It's just life.
No. That's not life.
Colin...
Do I have to?
Tonight we'll know what's wrong.
Now be sensible, take the pill.
I don't want to be sensible.
They're a horrible colour.
They smell bad and they wriggle.
Something's alive inside.
It won't live long once you drink some water.
What if it's a fish egg?
It's fortifying.
It's going to start over.
Just keep calm.
It's very,
very,
very...
Me too. I'm very... Me too.
Your suffering makes it worse.
No, I'm not suffering at all.
Hold me close.
We haven't made love for ages.
It's not advised.
Mangemanche is just jealous.
It is advised -I'm your wife.
Not just on my face.
I'm your wife!
Don't you want a wife anymore?
Stop.
Oh yes...
More...
All that canoodling has made me feel better.
You see? It can't be serious.
We'll walk more often from now on.
The trees smell good.
Of course. It's springtime.
Did I say something dull?
Not at all.
Saying "it's springtime" is dull.
- Let's see who can be dullest.
- No.
Who can be the most incredibly normal.
These buildings are
incredibly, utterly... dull.
Are you OK?
No, let's say exactly the opposite.
- The opposite to what?
- Of what we say.
Like...
That tree is magnificent!
Let's chop it down.
Don't cough.
Look at that.
The most stunning building around.
- So?
- It means he's the most knowledgeable.
Or the best-known.
- Knowledgeable.
- Known.
How are you, Chloe?
Well, I think.
And the pills?
They're OK.
What?
They were dreadful!
They made you feel awful.
That's regrettable.
Sorry. Do sit down.
Hold that. Sit down, Chloe.
- I'll stand.
- Me too. I'll stand.
Actually no. I'll sit.
Now, Chloe, Mr Colin...
Chloe, there's a problem with your lung.
There is something...
Mr. Colin?
Hold on...
- Are you OK?
- Yes.
Something in your lung, to be precise.
The droxylophomase
I prescribed caused a reaction.
I've scared you.
Yes I did . Come with me
and we'll take a look.
Hold still.
What's wrong with her?
It couldn't be worse.
Sorry. I'm a brute.
I meant there's nothing worse than you being sick.
We'll get you well.
Can you please tell me what's going on?
I want to help.
I'm not the husband, but I'm on the team, right?
We'll do it together.
Chloe has a water lily in her right lung.
We saw it.
It's quite big but we ought to be
able to get rid of it.
It really hurts when it moves.
The doc said we must surround it
with flowers to scare it off.
- No, to make it wither.
- To make it wither.
That's a good method.
Mangemanche is good. I keep telling you.
And... she mustn't drink.
What?
Nothing?
Just water.
Only two spoonfuls a day.
Two spoonfuls a day... Is that all?
No.
I have to get a job as well.
- Do you know what the job is?
- No.
Me neither. I'll ask the deputy-director.
Stop gesticulating.
Yes. Here, right away.
Bring me back number 226.
Don't come near me!
- I didn't.
- That's what they all say.
Back number 226.
- You broke a chair.
- Can you repair chairs?
I think so.
So you need a chair repairer?
Do you sit on the floor to work?
I guess he doesn't work much.
Doesn't work much!
You're a lazybones, that's what you are.
We've no work for a lazybones.
Not for him nor anyone else.
Then give me no work, if I'm a lazybones!
That's what I'd do.
I get it. You want to take the director's job.
Go on, get out.
- Don't touch me!
- Get lost!
You old bastard!
Loafer!
Chloe slept.
During the day, the water lily
gave her skin a lovely creamy hue.
Excuse me.
Let me help you.
You're slowing the pace! Get off the line!
I haven't finished my sentence!
You have to do something! This isn't fair!
Let him go!
Goodness me, you've aged.
I'm still 32.
Show me your passport.
47 years old.
Chloe's illness has hit us hard.
- You look lovely.
- New suit.
A gift from Chick.
He gives you nice things.
The Duchess of Bovouard
is the same size as me.
He bought it because there was
a paper by Partre in the pocket.
It suits you.
But the best thing
is this.
It was in the other pocket.
A nice pendant.
It'll bite your neck.
- Chloe?
- Up here.
Why not turn the light on? It's so dark.
I can't do a thing about it.
Luckily I'm not on my own.
- Isn't it sweet?
- Yes.
Go back to the flowers.
- Is it still growing?
- The water lily? No.
I think it'll go.
But I'm so thirsty.
Would a kiss help?
Maybe. Try it.
Your lips are cool.
What's this old itchy thing?
A gift from Chick.
Does it make me look like a grandma?
Look at this rag!
You look like Simone.
Auntie Simone!
- Do you still love Chick?
- Yes.
And he feels the same?
I don't know.
He loves his books.
If I wasn't married to Colin,
I'd like you to live with him.
Is that normal?
It's just the treatment.
I have to stay like this until they wilt.
There. It happens quickly.
- You keep on changing them.
- Yes.
Colin's going broke for me.
And he's sending me to the mountains.
I leave tomorrow.
But he's staying here to work.
Thank you.
I promise I won't worry.
I'll miss my platform.
Come here!
Nicolas, I have to tell you something.
But you must swear to never tell.
Of course. You can trust me.
What's the secret?
Take care of Colin.
Promise you won't tell him I said it!
Cross my heart. Goodbye, Chloe.
Don't tell him!
We can't get it clean now. It's on the inside.
I can't control them.
They're so resistant. It's incredible.
The nitric acid's turned them black
but it's not helping.
Can you manage?
Is it Gouffe?
Gouffe's for snobs.
Tell the truth.
The TV fusioned with the stove. Gouffe's toast.
But I'm fine without him, right?
Chloe's better. The fresh air is doing her good.
I got the doctor's bill. It's fair.
I'm almost broke now.
Your standards have lowered.
Chloe might need an operation...
Things are going badly on their own.
Nicolas is fading fast.
Your dessert.
Maybe you should quit. You're wasting away here.
You aged 10 years in 8 days.
No. 8 years in 10 days.
Fine. The Ponteauzannes need a cook.
Theirs has left. I said you'd do it.
That's an awful thing to do!
I'd feel I'd abandoned you.
You toasted Gouffe, you don't
dress on Sundays, and never shave.
My beard's stopped growing.
Go to the Pontauzannes. Be your old self.
What about Chloe?
Who'll take care of her?
I will.
I'll sell the pianocktail.
That'll be a start.
I'm not up to taking a new job.
Yes, you are. It's the atmosphere here.
- Go, I tell you!
- I can't do it.
I'm staying.
I promised.
You promised nothing, liar!
You're leaving, dammit.
I've had enough of you. Get out!
Get out!
I'm sorry.
Let me know how Chloe is doing.
I will give you a good price for this pianocktail.

...for the confederation of insanity,
whilst pregnating the walkers.
The patroness parodied with awe,
and by the shorted siblings...
Do you know... what time it is?
Production in your workshop is down 0.7%.
You're fired.
Your replacement's already here.
Here. Put this on.
The secretary will pay you 110 doublezoons.
They did quite a job on you.
Lie on your front, please.
That's where they took it out when it died.
How big was it?
3 feet, I think.
With a big flower measuring 8 inches.
That's bad luck. One that big is rare.
The other flowers killed it.
Especially the vanilla flower at the end.
It has stopped your right lung from working.
I don't mind if the other one is OK.
Make sure the other one doesn't catch something.
How do I stop that happening?
Who said anything was going to happen?
Just be careful.
Of course.
Thank you, Doctor.
I'm sorry.
She'll have to resume the treatment.
And another thing...
I think I made a mistake.
Here's some of your money back.
I've had no applicants for a month.
It's quite hard work, you realize.
Really? But it seems very well paid.
It wears you out. I don't know if it's worth it
but it's not for me to badmouth my bosses.
To make the proton guns grow evenly
without distortion,
we realized they needed human heat.
Get undressed.
The first thing to check is that the acorns
are well-oiled.
Your job is to put them in the dirt
where the spleen, liver and secreting organs are.
Then you stay like that for 24 hours.
Is using men really the only way?
Women's chests aren't flat
enough to distribute the heat.
There. Oh, and another thing -
when you hear this sound,
turn your head
so you don't crick your neck.
Chloe, look who brought you fresh flowers!
"Chloe, look who brought you fresh flowers!"
That's so sweet, Madame Davis, thank you.
They're all thanks to your husband.
We'll put them here.
- Shall we cut them?
- No, leave them in pots.
They'll live longer.
My place is doing the same thing.
But I think it's an illusion.
As you go through life,
spaces seem smaller.
Bye, kids. I won't outstay my welcome.
OK.
Take care, Madame Chloe.
It's just a lingering irritation.
No. It's the other lung.
- I dropped the pills again.
- Where?
Where are they?
- You won't find them.
- Yes, I will.
It doesn't matter.
I'll buy some more. There were none left anyway.
There were.
Why did Nicolas leave?
- What's wrong?
- I heard a noise.
It's nothing.
Just Madame Davis stumbling out.
You slept. She left long ago.
Go stamp out the noise and come back.
Chick?
Chick, stop!
It's Chick. He needs money. We have to help him.
What a screw-up!
- It's not his fault.
- No, I mean Partre.
They don't fit anymore.
Wait! It's got an idea! Come on.
Quick!
Of course. It's got a duplicate set in its house.
- No, leave some for you.
- Why?
For my tombstone? That's what you meant.
You're going to get better. Stop it!
You don't believe that for a second.
Your gray face would make a baby lose hope.
Poor Colin, you've no strength left.
At least Chick goes all the way.
You're falling apart.
Could you forgive me?
I love you so much and I'm going to lose you.
I don't know what's going on. It was OK at first.
Are you firing me?
What can I say?
Geneviove!
I don't get it.
Can't you use them elsewhere?
Yes. For the balls-up army, maybe.
Go ahead . Shoot.
- Shoot, for God's sake!
- I can't!
It's innocent.
They're all just as bad as each other!
You're not sleeping in your bed?
Yes.
I got up too early.
I was waiting for it to be time to go
and I went back to sleep.
Chick threw me out.
Did you have a fight?
No.
He doesn't understand you right now.
When he's calmer, you can explain.
He still loves you.
- No.
- I know he does.
Your hair...
Your face.
What about them?
- I'm dirty.
- I don't care.
Why is it him I love?
Because he's Chick.
- He's not the same Chick.
- Yes, he is.
It's things that change, not people.
Oh yeah?
Wait, Alise.
- Where are you going with that bag?
- I'm going home.
You move house, you take a bag. Leave me alone!
No. I have to go, too.
I've got a new job. It's horrible.
When Chloe's dead, you can stop working.
Why do you say such awful things?
It's not my fault!
I'm sorry. I didn't like what you said.
Go to work to save Chloe. I'm going to save Chick.
This perpetually evaporable continuation of energy
is apt for the self's ongoing presence while never
allowing it to be salaried. As such,
we normalize the factotery of the self.
It is this factotery
that serves to perpetuate
the disconvenience of the presence.
It's things that change,
not people.
Move over, boys.
Would you look at that...
Charges:
Unpaid taxes,
illicit substance abuse,
assault and battery smuggling.
He's ripe for the plucking.
ARREST WARRANT
Type it up.
I don't need anything. Go away.
I work for the administration.
The administration? What do they want?
We give notice of bad news.
Tomorrow...
you'll slip in the tub and break your hip.
What?
Can you call someone who can take you to hospital?
- You've written up to here?
- Yes.
How can I help you?
You mustn't publish it.
It was tricky to write.
I have a cramp in my wrist.
Chick's spent everything on your books.
He's free. He made a choice.
I'm free, too.
He left me so I'll kill you.
Could you undo your top button?
You do understand
I cannot subscribe to such an argument.
Stay here.
Remove the fillets from 3 chickens...
Nicolas? It's Dad. Partre's been killed...
at the Cafe de Flore by
a woman with a heart-snatcher.
A heart-snatcher?
It's Alise.
I must find her.
I'll bring her here so I can cheer her up.
I'll call you back.
I've got something for Chick.
He's not buying anymore.
You dropped your sugar tongs.
You won't take me!
Shall we shoot, boss?
No. Get the books.
No, not the books.
Not the books, no!
The order says "domestic violation".
Violate him!
Shoot, Douglas.
Oh, shit.
The other way round, idiots!
Not at me, just anywhere!
No point shuffling about.
The building's on fire.
Chick!
Alise...
Nicolas
Are you coming back to stay?
Promise you'll never leave.
Never again.
He walked down the street with a leaden heart
because the next day, Chloe would die.
Chloe is dead.
I know. You probably want a beautiful service.
I can do you something very nice
for 2,000 doublezoons.
I've only got 20. I'll have more soon.
A pauper's service, then.
I am poor
and Chloe is dead.
Do you realize what it means to
say "Chloe is dead"?
I want... Say: "Chloe is dead".
I want to hear you say it.
Can I say it? Chloe is dead.
I'd rather hear that than "I am poor".
I should advise you to ask God,
but for such a paltry sum,
it's maybe not advisable.
For 200, we're on your side.
Otherwise, we're against you.
I can't afford it! I have a job but not for long.
Call it 150 then.
We'll be against you
but it's better than doing without us.
Otherwise, we'll have to arrest you.
Please sign the papers.
It'll be a dreadful service.
Wait!
Come on.
Let's go.
I'm on the ground don't make a sound
I'm in the water...
Stop it! Stop!
And splash!
