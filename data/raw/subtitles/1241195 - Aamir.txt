I have sculpted my own destiny. And not only me,
thousands of others have sculpted their own destinies.
Aman sculpts his destiny on his own.

He'll ask you the number, tell him.
You remember it?
I sald i am not going anywhere unless you tell me...
I am telling you and also showing you

Look agaln.
Yourmom is thinking of you.
What should i tell her, huh?
She is dying to meet you. She keeps asking repeatedly,
when will my Aamir come, when?
Should i tell her that you don't care for her at all?
You are hardly concerned about her life and death.
Please, you...

Are you crippled or has paralysis hit you?
Come along.
Yes, come comfortably.

It's time to get away, you remember the way?
The goat is fresh brother.

Should i make it lighter?
Hey hero!
What did you think, that it was really a bomb, huh?
You are in the habit of asking too many questions?
Won't you ask whose money is it,
from where did it come?
I'll tell you.
It's of the community.
Our brothers have send it from all over
the world, for the purpose of war.
Have you ever sent money?

I don't want to eat.
You'll eat and only then will i send food for your family,
they must be hungry.
There it is, eat soon.
Draw out all the papers and put on the table.
Put the suitcase one in pocket and the key too.
Give away the suitcase and yourjob is over.

A simple man only brings about revolution.
I want to bring no revolution,
all i want is to live my life.
If every man thinks like you
what will become of the community?
If every man thinks about himself, then every
community will be blessed.

about your community.
I don't want to fight any battle.
Is this not your battle?
Aren't you a Muslim?
Yes, i am.
You are not a Muslim.
No, you are no Muslim.
Who are you to say so? Because it's every Muslim's
obligation to participate in war.
I don't agree.
Didn't you see for yourself, inSide the suitcase. How our
brother from foreign lands are helping us?
Nobody is helping anybody. It's always the near one's
that help.
You know more than me?

Push the sultcase under the seat and get off.
Sultcase... you changed the suitcase?
To change the destiny of the community.
Now you know why does a simple man fight?
To get back whatever was snatched away.
You knew everything, right?
We know everything, its only you who doesn't know.
Why are you making me do all this?
You should have done this, there. But you ran away.
You lost London and if you stay Silent, then you'll lose
Mumbal too.
It's not right.
It'sjust an act of retaliation.
Get off, you have thiee minutes. And then you will be a
patriot and your family members, free.
Get off, only two and a half minutes remaln.
Didn't you hear?
Now you have become "Aamir".
Congratulations brother, he got off.

Ablast took place in Mumbal's residential area.
You heard it right, blast in a residential area.
A terrorist got killed.
You heard it right, a terrorist got killed.
But no information about his links to any organization.
You are watching first fresh pictures of the bomb blast
on our channel.
We have no information as to why did that terrorist run
with the suitcase.
But had the bomb exploded inside the bus, at least
hundred people would have been killed.
