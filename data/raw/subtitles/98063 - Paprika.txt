<b>PAPRIKA</b>
- Is this it?
- Yes, you'll be alright.
God Nino, I am frightenned!
Just 15 days and we'll solve all our problems.
Yes, it'll be our secret.
Remember, Mimma, don't think about me too much.
- Shall I ring?
- Wait, I'd rather leave
See you in 15 days!
Who is it?
Hello, I'm the girl who..
Come in.
Wait here.
Welcome. You're prettier
than what they said.
- Where are you from?
- Near Pola.
I could have bet.
Slavs have great asses and can really
use their tongues. You too, I hope.
I don't have much experience.
Don't worry. One day in a whorehouse
is worth 10 years outside.
Show me your hands.
The hands are mirror of the pussy.
Nice. It shows you're a classy girl.
Thank you, ma'am.
Don't call me ma'am, I'm Madam Colette,
the manager.
My mother was French and in my youth.
I danced at the Folies Bergeres.
I'll show your room.
You don't need a contract to work here.
Don't throw tantrums and we'll get along.
The house is always open
but you have 1 shift off a week.
- Alright, Madam Colette.
- You cannot refuse a client
unless you are related.
- As you wish.
- It's not up to me.
- It's police regulations.
- I understand.
The "Mystery Salon" for those who
wish to be unseen.
Sometimes clients pay in the room.
Deliver the money to register and
collect your tokens.
After the 15 days you can cash them in.
The house takes out 50%
for electricity,
heat, medical, maid service, taxes...
plus room and board.
Extras not included.
The prices at the register
are symbolic, like fixed menus.
Special requests are extra.
- This is your room, like it?
- Wow!
- What luxury!
- It's one of the best.
Thanks, you'll be pleased with me.
The bell is over there.
Ring once for a standard trick.
Twice for a double, 3 times for a half-hour
which usually isn't more than 15 minutes.
Work him with your mouth first to save time
- after examining...
- What do you mean?
Hygiene.
Bring him to the sink, hold his shaft,
wash it and squeeze it open.
If there are spots, cuts, or a drop comes out
give a long ring and we'll send him away.
Oh, for diseases!
- Good! Got your medical records?
- Sure.
Wasserman, histological test, vaginal smear...
Fine, show it to the doctor.
He'll be here soon for the weekly visit.
- Have you eaten?
- No.
Come along and meet the others.
This is the new girl, from Pola.
Hello, I'm Gina from Gorizia, sit down.
Fulvia, from Milan.
- Rome.
- Genova.
- Bolzano.
- Venice.
Goulash, Thursday's speciality.
I do my speciality every single day!
- What's your name?
- The name won't do. Mimma
but from now on we'll call her...
Paprika?
- Paprika!
- Yes!
You're spicy like goulash.
Do you give this?
Ass! Every girl is known for what she does.
Names say it all.
Say where you're from and they know
what to expect.
Naples or Messina means knockers.
Everyone knows Bologna means blow jip.
Venice or Verona, class and elegance
along with the dirtiest minds.
- And Pola?
- Your speciality is a greats ass.
Wiggle it well and you won't regret it!
And if a client goes like this?
- What does it mean?
- He wants gross things: piss, shit
That's extra and very expensive!
3 fingers on cheek means "the scale".
That's threesome with a male up your ass
to balance out the client in your cunt.
Or an extra girl for some dyking.
I'm going to rest.
We're also taking naps
You're sweet, I hope we become friends.
I hope so too.
You got an old man?
A pimp, who takes your money.
Come on, Sonia.
The doctor's here.
Quick, let's go to the infirmary.
- Here's the new girl.
- Take off your clothes!
- New to the house or new new?
- My first day.
Sounds like you're going to a party.
- Nice job you chose. Why?
- Serious family reasons.
Mother's ill, father's dead, so...
Breathe deeply!
Unfortunately I had no choice.
That sigh of yours made it realistic.
- I've heard that song before!
- Doctor, I was serious.
That's what you all say.
But I don't fall for it. Tell me the truth.
I'm doing it to help my fiancé,
he's an electrician.
He has the opportunity to buy out his boss
but he needs money and we thought...
You'd earn it quickly in a brothel.
Great idea!
Only 15 days then we'll get married.
- Whose idea was it?
- Mine, I mean Nino's.
It sounded good to me.
You know what your Nino is? A pimp.
You just don't know him.
Think carefully about what you're doing.
You haven't started.
You can leave if you want, no one can stop you.
It was my decision.
You're a beautiful, healthy girl,
why ruin yourself?
- Just 15 days!
- Poor idiot, you'll never leave!
You scare me. What should I do?
Ask Jesus for help, if you believe.
I can take care of myself!
You know why I need money?
Because my father squandered it on whores!
And you're here to get it back?
Well, at least a part, what's wrong with that?
What a character!
You know they don't all wear condoms.
- What happens if you get pregnant?
- I'll shoot myself!
No need, just wear this.
Does it hurt?
No! The vagina must be moist
to insert it well.
- Am I hurting you?
- Oh, no...
- I think you're getting lubricated.
- You bet!
You're terrific, I want you for my first client!
Go on, and good luck!
Well, gentleman, waiting for a virgin?
What's with you? Did you choke on a tit?
Want to make love with Roma-doma?
Bye, cutie, come back soon.
A standard.
A tip for procuress? Go on.
You're ready to start?
Sooner or later... better sooner than later.
Practice makes perfect.
And now for novelty:
Pola's own Paprika with the consoling ass!
Come on, Pola, console me!
This way...
Enjoy? Come back soon!
Wait, the sink first
- You don't have any diseases?
- No.
What'll it be? Half-hour?
Whatever you want.
- Oh God, I came!
- So!
I'm not supposed to!
Get out... Get dressed!
- How come you're a whore?
- Why do you come to the whorehose?
- The prettiest girls are here
- You forgot to ring the bell!
- I did worse, I came.
- Oh my God!
If you come with every client,
you don't belong here.
- Bye.
- She came and you don't tip her?
Bye Paprika.
You must learn self-control, fake it.
Tell him you love it but don't come
or you'll end up with consumption.
- But how?
- Think about something else.
something sad...
your dead relatives, your debts.
Think of Mazzini, Garibaldi, Carducci!
- Think of your priest!
- I'll try, but he was so cute.
They won't all be, so you'll get over it.
Come on, let's go back down.
I'll forgive you this time.
Gentlemen, we're here to screw not chat.
39...
Wow, almost 50.000 lira, not bad!
How do you feel?
Like I was flattened by a steamroller.
Shit, you went strong! They love you!
Let me feel.
You have some fever. Luana, the thermometer.
What happened? Let me feel...
- It's just exhaustion.
- Go straight to bed.
Let's go to sleep!
How can you sleep without a pill?
This is a great sleeping pill...
My brandy will make you feel just dandy!
And get her drunk so she throws up?
You make me so angry!
You don't love me anymore.
Get out, leave her alone, she need to rest.
It's nothing, just exhaustion.
Why does Sonia let Tosca treat her like that?
Sonia is a baby doll. Clients love to spank her.
Tosca is a hitter.
They both enjoy it so they continue off duty.
I don't understand affairs among women.
Better get used to it. Madam Colette does it.
- She'll do it to you too.
- No, that is not my scene!
Well, you can't avoid it...
plus it's so relaxing.
- So you too...
- Sure and I love it!
Now, go to sleep...
I see cocks flying when I close my eyes.
That's why girls make love to each other.
- It's so liberating.
- Maybe but I don't like it.
It erases the day's dirt.
- I'm not a lesbian!
- I am!
What a great pussy!
Stop...
God, how nice!
I don't see cocks any more, I see clouds.
I feel cleansed, pure, light.
I'm flying!
Come in!
Good morning. You called me?
Come here, Cherie.
I'm pleased, in a week
you have done as much as three girls.
I do my best.
And you enjoy it.
You can stay an extra 15 days.
- Thank but...
- And sleep out your day off.
- That is not it...
- I trust you.
You're a good girl.
- You'll never be a dyke
- What?
It happens to women
who have an intense sex life.
They develop their masculine side.
I didn't know!
But women don't have a dick
and must wear a fake one.
- Like this!
- What is it?
It's called "godemichet".
I bought it in Paris.
Touch it...
Touch it!
Thighter!
Feel how hard!
Like it, slut!
- Why are you treating me like this?
- Because you are a whore
who wants to get fucket by her mistress.
Lie down!
Spread your legs or you're fired.
Alright, mistress.
I'm your stallion, dirt whore.
You're my slave.
I'm glad you are back
even thought you make me come.
It's chemistry. We're made for each other.
I don't even know you or what you do.
My name is Franko,
I'm at the Nautical School here in Trieste.
- Doing what?
- Officer's training.
A sailor like in the movies.
How can you fuck those creeps?
All you do is glare at those you don't like
and they pick someone else.
I would have picked you anyway.
And you didn't glare so you must like me.
Well, yes... a bit.
- Let's go out then.
- Why not? I'm off tomorrow.
We'll have a nice dinner.
No, I'm eating with Nino.
- He's your fiancé?
- Yes... I'll surprise him.
- So you want two guys?
- I'm a whore, aren't I?
Nino has a business dinner tonight.
- We'll have a dinner then.
- I'll buy, I've earned enough.
No way, I'm not like Nino.
Sailor, don't talk that way about him.
- Nino is sweet and we're in love.
- Alright don't get mad.
How long will you continue this life?
Till I have Nino's money and we get married.
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.
When are you finished school?
1 month then off to sea.
Maybe on a fishing boat. Some go to Japan.
- And bring fresh fish back to Italy.
- They keep it on ice.
They must have caught this lobster in Senegal!
- Who's the lady?
- I'll find out.
- What are you doing here?
- And you? You had a business dinner.
Exactly, the lady is interested.
- Who is she?
- I'm his fiancée.
But Nino and I have been together 3 years!
Say it isn't true!
I can explain to both of you.
- Pig!
- Liliana, I can explain.
Wait, I'll explain.
Come on don't be upset.
You're better off without him.
Paprika
You can call me Mimma, it's my real name.
- Where are you going?
- It's been nice but I must go.
I'll be captain soon, we can sail away.
- Me too?
- Yes, the Captain's wife!
The thought makes me nauseous.
- You get seasick?
- No, marriage-sick!
I've already been fucked over
but I learned my lesson.
What lesson?
Thanks to Nino I have a good-paying job.
I'll continue with it but for me this time.
Mo more pretty words and promises.
You know where I am if you want to see me.
I felt like I was standing there
covered with shit!
You mustnt fall for another one.
Never again. Alone, free, with my money.
- I'd like to stay another fortnight.
- Of course.
Oh my God, Nino!
He can't touch you.
You can have him arrested.
- What do I do?
- Nothing, relax.
We have to talk.
She's got her period, find someone else.
Don't worry.
I just want to talk to her.
I'm staying here.
- What's up, none of you horny today?
- I'm through with you!
You're disgusting!
It's not that easy. You owe me for this job!
- I'll send you to jail first.
- For what?
I didn't take your money.
At least not yet.
What you owe me
you'll put in a bank account without my name.
So there is no crime my little whore!
I can leave when I want, it's my life!
You've got a record for prostitution now.
You'll get a travel warrant
if you don't behave.
I want 60% at the end of the month.
What a creep! I have to leave Trieste.
I need help. He threatened me.
I'll help you, what are friends for?
I know who to ask. We'll protect you from Nino.
Remember our duet at the Concert Majol?
Sing it, please.
You're Paprika, aren't you?
I'm the owner. I've heard about you.
Pleased to meet you.
Come sit over here.
They want to have some fun alone!
Madame Colette is right:
you are my loveliest flower.
How gallant, Mr. Tommei.
I love beauty.
I offer beautiful women to those who
can appreciate.
- I'm an aesthete.
- Only a noble soul can love music.
I like you. Most girls here have a pimp
but I'll protect you.
Will you be mine?
So suddenly?... I'm confused.
- Does this disgust you?
- Oh no!
Don't touch my hump,
I'm not a good luck charm!
I didn't want to offend you.
What a blunder!
Go, I'll give you time to think
but we'll meet again.
Wizen up! You'll be alright with Tommei.
Can't say no to him.
We all went throught it.
Plus he's an extra large
like all dwarves and hunchbacks.
He'll make you a queen!
A nice ass won't go far if someone
ain't pushing it.
My respects.
Can I talk with Frufru?
If she wants...
- Please, not here.
- Move!
- Who is that?
- Frufru's pimp, a real man.
He scares me.
He's crazy, be careful.
Rocco, open immediately!
I apologize... My respect to you
but this whore is through with me.
- You'll hang for this.
- Up yours!
What'd he do?
He beat me for not telling him about
the downpayment I put on bar.
Bring her to the infirmary and
call Dr.Matteucci
Down stair ladies.
Nothing to see, go back down.
We have gloves for those boxing lovers.
I have a stomach ache. Can I go to my room?
Of course dear, don't be too long.
- May I?
- Please...
I heard you had a tummy ache.
Were you scared?
Unfortunately these nasty things happen.
Drink up.
- It's homemade liqueur.
- You're too kind!
- What're you looking at?
- Nothing. What are you doing?
I'm coming to pick my loveliest flower.
Please, I'm still upset.
That is why I'm here. Move over.
You're so nice... Let's just be friends.
Spread your legs whore or you're out!
Let's hope he brings me luck.
I felt sorry for him,
but he'll want to continue.
Every day for a month, at least.
So, because of that, of Nino e Franco.
- He'll come back.
- I hope so.
So I've decided to quit. What do you think?
You have a lot of options.
You couldn't be secretary.
- We have a record now.
- I wouldn't like it anyway.
So, then show business.
I've worked in clubs, you earn a lot.
- Where did you work?
- Mostly Rome.
I can give you a lost of addresses.
- Write it all down.
- I'll even write some references.
- Going to Rome?
- Obviously, if I'm on this train.
- I saw you at Madame Colette's.
- Me too.
Aren't you ashamed of how you treated Frufru?
I sweated blood for her
and she didn't keep her word!
You always keep your word with Rocco...
or you're through!
You making a scene?
- What house you going to?
- No house, I'm quitting.
Good, with those tits you can do what you want.
Idiot!
You didn't fuck everybody at Madame Colette's.
- Not you!
- We'll fix that.
- Fuck you!
- You got it.
- Move, over there.
- Are you crazy?
Move! Ever done it on a train?
It'll call for help!
Like it, huh?
Yes... Yes...
Darling you're so macho.
- 12:20, it's late!
- Where're you going?
- Jub hunting.
- I'll come with you.
No need, Gina gave me addresses and numbers
and reference letters.
I'll find something for my new life!
I know all the clubs in Rome. I'll take you.
It's better if I go alone.
Bye, see you tonight.
I'll be here!
Crumb? It's Rocco.
Get busy.
I need something arranged.
I wasn't expecting such rejection. No work.
I'll keep trying.
There aren't just Gina's clubs.
Why don't you just forget it?
You'll ruin your health in clubs.
Better to be in an elegant house full
of actors, politicians
monsignors and rich foreigners.
I don't want to be a whore again!
Is a club hostess any better?
And the drinking will kill your liver.
I'll find you a worthy setting.
I don't need a pimp like Frufru!
I'm insulted!
You think I'd take money from you?
Forget it, you don't trust me.
Would I really meet actors, politicians?
You bet! I'll tell Milvo.
- What is he?
- Italy's biggest pimp.
A great guy. I'll set up a meeting.
No commitments, though.
She's beautiful, fresh, with great tits.
- How old are you?
- 18
Walk to the door.
You have a great ass.
Let me feel.
Nice and firm!
Thanks. You need a first-class house.
Madame Saffo in Florence.
- Or "Mirror" in Milan.
- I'd rather stay in Rome.
Well then Madame Olimpia.
You'd like it there.
Silence!
Athos, call Madame Olimpia.
You do everything, right?
- I guarantee.
- I said silence!
It's not easy to get into Olimpia's
but if he talks to her it's settled.
She's expecting you tomorrow morning.
Give her this.
Stay a fortnight or two.
In a week you'll pay my commission.
You're a gentleman!
Silence! I hate pimps.
Bye dear.
Don't bathe before going to Olimpia's.
- Why?
- Go... You'll go far.
I was swimming champion
at the Berlin Olympics in '36
That is why they call me Olimpia.
Feel these muscles!
- Harder than steel!
- Harder than a hard cock!
- Arm wrestle?
- You'd beat me right away!
Keep me company...
Did you bathe this morning?
Dirty slut!
Good little girls wash every day.
- I was told...
- Quiet!
Now your mommy will fix you a bath. Strip.
Some nice suds.
Get in.
Scented bubble bath...
Stand up, we'll clean your bottom.
- what a nice scrubs!
- Enjoying it, dirty slut?
Are you coming? What a cunt!
I love you!
How dare you, slut?
Out!
Out, get to work!
- Half hour.
- Good.
You're doing great.
Hy big guys, I'm on fire.
You want some "paprika" on your cock?
You got money?
I knew it would happen sooner or late.
That man by the door is my uncle.
I'll take care of him.
What's with the hands in your pocket?
I'll make it hard for you!
It's hard already!
Come on, I want you to bang me.
Jerk!
Let's go.
What are we waiting for?
Come on, sportsman...
Tennis players pull out yourballs,
cyclists start pedalling!
You daring soldiers straighten your bayonets!
You want a half-hour?
- You'll enjoy me.
- What a nice job, Mimma.
You recognized me? It's been years.
Your face is changed
but I'd recognize your bottom anywhere.
Shame on you!
Please, uncle.
I'm only here temporarily.
- Promise you won't tell on me?
- How could you?
The scandal will come out anyway.
They'll never know.
I'm leaving here the end of the week.
Swear you won't tell! Promise?
I feel sorry for you...
Uncle, you put your tongue in my mouth!
I recognized your ass
because it always turned me on
You were always touching it.
I thought it was a game.
I've been waiting over 10 years for it.
What you're doing is shameful.
When you were little we'd play hide and seek.
I'd catch you and feel your bottom...
How nice! Let's do a half-hour, an hour...
It's free, anyway.
You won't make me pay, huh?
Don't cry you're wetting my balls.
I know it's less than usual...
What is the matter? Losing your touch.
I've never worked so hard before.
There's at least 100 missing!
Alright, you might as well know.
My uncle is blackmailing me.
What the hell are you talking about?
He recognized me and comes by everyday.
He wastes my time and doesn't pay.
I didn't tell Madame Olimpia yet.
- Get me out of this.
- Sure! He's insulting me too.
Meet him at the grand Italia cafe
and keep these.
I lost at poker again last night too.
He's starting at your things. Show them off.
It's nice that people
are excited by my slut niece.
I'm glad I found you again.
I want to win some money back tonight.
Can you land me something?
What about all the money
you're making me lose?
Don't be stingy! Open your legs more.
They're eating you up with their eyes.
Excuse me.
Rocco, this is my uncle who loves me so much.
You drooling disgusting pig.
If you don't leave my woman alone
I'll break your face!
You're sweaty and dirty, uncle!
Go!
I feel a lot better.
Waiter, 3 Negronis.
You know that I'll protect you...
And thank you.
When I said "my woman" you approved.
I love you.
To my woman and her man
who made a nice arrangement.
What did you set up?
A nice foursome with Prince Brando,
the famous playboy.
- At his place?
- Yes, you and a friend.
I fixed everything with Madame Olimpia.
Hooray! What a great day!
Good, you're on time.
Come in.
Come in, girls.
- It's a pleasure, Prince.
- No, call me Ascanio.
This is my wife.
The Duchess Dolgorouki,
an old Polish family.
Sit down, dears.
Have some champagne.
- Where're you from?
- Pola...
Well, nearby.
Pola... the Yugoslavs stole it from us.
We'll get it back someday.
Nice fresco...
Yes, not bad... a Giulio Romano.
Silvia get ready, we'll be dinning soon.
I'll be right back.
The best cocktail there is.
Mom snorted it with a gold straw
that Dad gave her for their anniversary.
I like this way better, it's easier.
It's really good!
You like it?
Relax. Take off your panties!
A sweet scent of roses!
Let's eat. Just something simple...
Some good caviar...
Sit down girls.
Silvia, pour the girls some wine.
Stupid good for nothing!
Excuse me, Miss.
Not enough. Slap her.
Slap her, she likes it.
- Harder, a real slap.
- May I?
Thanks. Allow me to dry you off.
No, use the napkin...
I dropped under the table.
Like it, huh?
My wife's a real nibbling goat, huh?
Cunt is tasty!
Eat up...
She's an ardent lesbian.
That's why I married her.
But I'd rather drink.
No... from the fountain.
Prince, are you drunk on horse piss?
Dom Perignon, my dear, an expensive burp!
I'll drink piss now, I'm thirsty!
Yes, my slave, lick your adoring whore.
From the fount to my mouth.
Give me your ass.
How nice in a Prince's house!
Oh, your ass!
Here... have it all!
Up your ass...
Butt fucker!
- Did you enjoy?
- I don't talk to butt fuckers!
What's wrong, Beba?
I don't know...
A cough, too much wine.
Maybe I drank too much.
I got it today, from Franco.
- Nice... who is he?
- My dream man. I want to see him.
I want to be him. I want to quit.
Think it over carefully.
- You make a lot of money here.
- I've made enough.
- It's time to quit.
- We'll all quit.
They're about to close us legally.
Take advantage of the situation.
Change towns, go to Milan.
I can talk to "Mirrors"
- It's a luxurious house.
- I wonder how Rocco would take it.
I take care of your pimp.
I'll tell to my Police Chief
friend and he'll arrest him.
But I love him too
and all those crazy clients.
and all the girls...
...and you too.
A brothel is a big family.
- What should I do?
- Let me close up and give you bath.
Gentlemen...we're closing!
Scram!
Are you fags or did the soccer game
deflate your balls?
Beba's sick! She spit up blood!
I knew she'd have a bad ending!
A doctor, call a doctor.
I'm a doctor.
Nothing we can do unfortunately.
I want a priest.
Do something Father.
Do you repent child?
A squeeze will do.
We were all there.
Her mother went crazy.
She didn't know her line of work.
The house is in mourning for 3 days.
We all go sooner or later.
God forgives those who fuck.
I saw myself ending up the same way.
I'm leaving.
What do you mean you're leaving?
I want to quit.
I had a fun. I have money, that's enough!
Now that you're such a hit?!
You made money off of me.
I set up those expensive tricks!
And took 50%. I could report you.
Report me?
You have no future without me!
I'll work in a nightclub.
Where? Call to all the clubs
and they shut door in your face!
- You did that? You son of a bitch!
- I can make things tough for you.
You don't scare me, pig!
You're asking for it!
- What's happening?
- Call the police!
It's nothing...
He'll be out in days
if you don't report him.
Well?
I'd hate to see him in jail.
I can have him watched they'll arrest
him if he tries anything else.
That sounds better.
I'm leaving at the end of the week.
I can't go on after what happened to Beba.
You'll change your mind in a few days.
Feel like a bath? I have some great bubbles!
No, not today.
I feel dizzy.
My period's late.
What about your diaphragm?
- I noticed it was broken.
- That's all you need!
I'm so sad, so lonely...
Don't get upset.
Come on, you might not be pregnant.
Even so know the right place.
I went there years ago.
To France.
Dr. Bavarelli I don't speak French.
You were stupid. I'm Italian too
like everyone here in Marseilles.
- My diaphragm broke.
- It happens.
You came to the right place,
they're horrible in Italy
dirty, unhygienic...
- Will it take long?
- A few minutes.
Does it hurt?
Don't worry, after you will feel fine
calm, relaxed...
and quite sensuous.
Eat the egg, it'll give you strength.
I need it more than you do.
You wear me out.
I'll do at least 7 tonight.
- What are you doing in Marseilles?
- And you?
I just landed!
let's go...
I'll buy a hotel and live like a lady
- With you if you want.
- My life is at sea.
You've only been sailing a month!
I always felt the need,
plus we'd always fight.
- Well you're so crabby.
- I'm jealous.
With you I have reason to be.
I've changed, no man except for you.
- Can I trust you?
- You saw me in the bar.
With a kid. Very innocent!
Sail away with me.
- How? Where?
- On my boat.
What boat?
A boat they're selling in Leghorn.
- I've decided to buy it.
- With what money?
- I'll borrow it.
- From whom?
From you.
- Where are we going?
- To the Molucche!
Just think, a new life in the Orient!
... in the Orient, in the Orient...
The boat was mortgaged and
the police seized it.
- And your money?
- Who knows if I'll get it back!
We've done a lot of negotiating...
then the lawyers, the tribunals...
Poor Paprika... and Franco?
That idiot!
He left on another boat.
I've fallen on my ass in the dirty,
I don't even have money for the train.
This ass will never hit the dirt.
It's a real mess!
So, this sailor cock...
You've got it hard, eh?
Why not come in?
It's the first time that I really
feel like I'm in a bordello!
Lucky you found me,
you'll soon feel better, you'll see.
This may be a bordello,
but the pay's very good!
Stop! Let her go!
Go away!
Scoundrels!
Go away all of you!
Remo, we'll wait a bit before we reopen!
Anyway, clean the floor!
How we've come down in the world!
You said it!
I've been in some of the best houses!
I met some real gentlemen!
They covered me with diamonds!
Vespasiano, what did you do
with all those diamonds?!
Cut it out! If fuck up your feet
you'll never fuck again.
Why do they call her Vespasiano?
I've seen more cocks than Vespasian urinal.
And I'm proud of it!
Turned tricks for 30 years!
Once you set foot here, you never leave!
Why?
You'll see... You won't leave...
ever again!
Open Remo!
Gina will we end up like Vespasian?
No, we'll make tons of money.
Go off with our guys
and go on tonguing each other!
I'm leaving at the end of the week.
Got a job.
Yes, at "Mirrors" in Milan.
Wow!
To the rooms, gentlemen!
The clock is ticking!
Welcome back, Admiral!
Don't call me Admiral here. Her and her...
Immediately. Girls...
Wait!
Impotent, we have no time to lose!
- Who's he?
- Admiral Sancalaspi.
He goes to the worst brothels incognito.
You, on top!
Hurry, bite her ass!
Idiot, harder!
More!
Harder, till she bleeds!
Silence, slut!
No, my ass is not an ashtray!
- Put your ass up, whore!
- He's crazy!
Better not argue.
Open wide...
I'll stick it in...
- I'll rip you open...
- Oh no!
- Not up my ass!
- How dare you refuse? Cunt!
Stick it up your cadets' asses!
Admiral...
If you'd like I...
Your ass, cunt!
- What's going on?
- This whore won't give me her ass.
How dare you refuse an Admiral?
I'll give it to whom I please!
Do it or you're out!
Fuck off!
If you want to work Milan is your city.
60%
- I thought 50.
- You make money fast here.
But you gotta hurry, there are rumour.
Of closing down? I heard.
That slut of Senator...
They closed 3 in Ferrara.
This is Meris.
See what a nice girl we've got?
They've closed 4 houses in Genoa.
You'll meet the new girl in the lounge.
Get to work!
Meris take her upstairs
find her a nice costume.
- She's the harem girl type.
- No more harems!
What's the matter, boys
your dicks not working?
The girls are nice and horny!
Great, but stick out your tits.
How beautiful! It's like the movies.
What nice dolls...
Foreign ones too!
Karin is Swedish. What a great ass!
- You wanna deflower me?
- Hey girls!
You the new girl?
Let's inaugurate you.
- Yes, commander?
- Send up the usual coffee.
Sure, nice and strong.
Hello, this is Angelina from "Mirrors".
Send up the usual coffee... Thanks.
- You're an important businessman.
- Right!
Where's that coffee?
Where should I put my savings?
- In Switzerland?
- Not Switzerland!
I'll make your money grow
dearly girl, don't worry!
It's the coffee.
Aren't you Bertelli from the
vulcanising department?
- You turn tricks too?
- I need to moonlight.
You always deduct our raises!
You're always stricking.
- What about the company assets?
- You have to buy new machinery.
Government subsides all go to Southern Italy.
That's just talk.
Meanwhile you spend all your
money at the casino
and we get it up the ass!
Funny you should say that.
Can I call my boyfriend?
- Long distance?
- No.
Make it short.
This isn't good.
Unless the Church steps in
we'll have to close down.
Double time!
My daughter!
She's in boarding school in Florence.
Cute. My boys in Göteborg.
Sweden! Will you take me there?
This is my boyfriend.
Let's see. Handsome.
- He a sailor?
- Captain. I want to give him a boat.
So he runs off to sea!
Come on you stallions.
What're you waiting for?
These Amazons wanna ride! Come on cowboys
or I'll close up shop!
You scared of pussy?
Blushing?
You're cute.
Come on big guy.
- You won't give me away?
- No, this is fun.
- Are you a lesbian?
- I'm a reporter.
I want to know what goes on in here.
Same as any place else: fucking.
Tell me about your job.
It's the best.
We give joy, hope, illusions.
Illusions?
We scream and fake it
to make them feel macho
even if it's the size of a cigarette.
- Isn't it tough?
- Not if you like the work.
and aren't ashamed otherwise it's just
another trick! You need a proud pussy.
You sound like a real smart girl.
If I was bitchy I'd be a reporter...
no offense.
Sure. What do you do with a client?
There are different recipes.
Mine has a thousand ingredients:
honey hands, rose lips
caramel tongue.
Wanna try?
Treat me like a client!
First I strip you.
Then I examine your dick
for diseases.
It's huge!
Then?
Rose lips and caramel tongue!
Stop!
You're crazy!
Leave me alone!
You're crazy!
I knew it, you intellectuals
are sluttier than us.
Out!
Get out you dead birds!
Here is the temple of Eros.
To be experienced before it closes!
Count!
Hello, Madame Angelina.
This is for my son's 18th birthday.
A tour of such splendours!
- Yourself included.
- What an honor!
Ladies!
Such flowers for those asshole clients.
Pearls for swine, orchids in manure.
Choose carefully.
- What're you doing father?
- It's an old method.
A slap to remember what you saw.
Sluts show off your jewels to my heir!
Who are you, blowjop libs?
Paprika, great name for whore!
I'm Count Bastiano Rosasco.
- I knew you were a Count.
- How?
Only aristocrats are this vulgar!
I think you'll have a good time with her!
I'll hear all about it later!
My dear!
Is the dress your or the house's?
Did you invite me here to make fun of me?
No, I really respect you.
Gualtiero was overjoyed by your performance.
Come, I'll introduce you.
Paprika, a good friend and terrific ass.
You're still a bad boy even if you are 70.
Don't mind him.
Actually it was a compliment.
He said it to me too.
- I know you.
- Yes, Miss.
- From where?
- The brothel, Miss.
I can't recall.
It's nice and hard!
If you would follow me to the cloakroom.
- I'll shove it up your ass!
- What a great idea!
Let's go.
- Where is the coke?
- I got it.
- Put it in Auntie's saccharine.
- You wanna kill her?
I wouldn't mind the inheritance!
Caught you!
- Get out, rascal!
- Am I fired?
No, I'll double your salary
now get out.
Quick! I haven't gotten it up in 3 years.
It's a pleasure.
How nice!
Paprika!
You're the woman I've waited for.
Marry me, Paprika.
Mar-ry meee!
Let me introduce my future wife Mimma.
Paprika for friends. Aunt Rinalda.
Cousin Eleanor, Padre Bardelli
my son Gualtiero whom you know
my sister Josephin, my brother Gustav, Gino.
- I have to talk to you.
- What is it?
I'm glad to have a whore for a stepmother.
We'll get along, right?
You'll have to respect me.
The joke is gone too far.
Dragging our name in the dirt.
You dragged it in bankruptcy court!
Shall we toast my marriage?
You're from Venice?
Close, from Pola.
Ah, good people. Hard-working, generous...
She's very generous.
You do what you can.
Those with money give money,
those with a body...
Even a nice body is a God's gift.
I always say it takes a monk
to take appreciate a piece of ass!
Shall we toast our marriage Paprika?
Drink up?
Josephine, toast with us!
All right...
Excuse me!
You can't stay with that wet shirt.
- Take it off.
- Help me, darling.
That's not enough, take it all off.
Look, assholes, the woman.
I always wanted.
She makes me hard.
She's my joy!
She'll be Countess Rosasco!
Bravo Bastiano!
A toast!
The mail, Countess.
Over there, thanks.
They're for you, they all loved you!
No imagination.
Look at this!
Congratulation for your wedding,
just got the news
All the best from Jamaica.
A toast to the money you married.
Love you Franco.
I love you too.
You don't mind, do you?
"Senate approves Merlin law"
"Law to close brothels
has overcome final obstacles"
Hear that, Bastiano?
It's the end of an era.
What a shame!
Make your bids! A 1920 bidet.
It's seen the best cunts and asses in Italy.
I want it at any price!
Can I have it? It's so familiar.
Take everything...
Watch out for diseases now!
Take the tokens too.
Bid for the clitoral vibrator!
Panties, bras, garters!
A fetishist's dream!
Mirrors, lamps, the Four Seasons.
I'll pick them up tomorrow.
Auctioning a pair of tits
an ass and aristocratic pussy.
Any offers?
Paprika!... I mean, Countess...
Come here, you old whore!
Madame Colette I couldn't help
saying goodbye to the house I started.
We must be strong Paprika!
What'll happen now?
Delinquency, diseases...
out on the streets...
The ancient art of eroticism is dead!
My poor husband always said so.
- You free?
- How dare you? She's Countess!
I'm a whore and I'm proud of it!
Thanks to these tits, ass and cunt.
I've become rich and respected.
Champagne for all, it's on me!
Goodbye half hour passions!
Goodbye splashing bidets and bags of tokens!
Goodbye to husband looking for
thrills they can't get at home.
Goodbye to sweet fetishist.
Goodbye charming students!
Goodbye everyone!
That's enough or I'll cry!
Drink up! Life is short but pussy is eternal!
Freebies for all today.
No charge, it's a gift!
Look!
The boat I gave Franco for our wedding.
He looks great in uniform!
That's him!
My sailor, you won't escape me again!
The End
