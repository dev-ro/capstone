TEN YEARS LATER

[birdsong]
[crow caws]
[faint echo of gunfire]
[reverberation of distant shots]
[gunfire fades]
This was an enclosed convent
before the war.
We had to be evacuated.
No amount of plaster
could ever cover up this shame.
I assume you've heard
the terrible stories from those days.
I was a child then.
I know.
[nun] As soon as peace came,
the diocese decided
to take back the building
and turn it into a school for young girls
from low-income backgrounds.
They are all extremely grateful
and so volunteer to do various chores.
Only Mother Superior, Sister Sagrario,
and I remain from the old community.
The others chose not to return.
[crow caws overhead]
[novice] So the others that are here...?
[nun] They came from elsewhere. Like you.
But now we all belong to the same house.
There are no distinctions here.
We are all equals within these walls.
I'm going to let Mother Superior know
that you have arrived.
Wait here.
[knocking on door]
[door creaks closed]
IF THERE CAN BE ONE ON EARTH,
THIS HOUSE IS HEAVEN.
FOR THOSE WHO ARE CONTENT
ONLY BY MAKING GOD CONTENT.
[rolling object rattling on tiles]
[macabre instrumental music playing]
[music building slowly]
- [music ends]
- Sister Narcisa.
Mother Superior is waiting for you.
[gasps] If it isn't Sister Narcisa.
[chuckles happily] You can't imagine
how pleased I am to have you joining us.
- [Narcisa laughs softly]
- No, please.
Look, my dear. Come closer.
Sister Julia, pass me the photograph.
In that difficult time,
you gave us hope and strength
so that we might overcome adversity.
- [bells tolling]
- [clock ticking]
[Mother] I still remember
how we felt hearing the news about you
{\an8}from that lost village in the mountains.
{\an8}THE VIRGIN MARY APPEARS IN SPAIN
{\an8}[Narcisa] Peroblasco.
{\an8}The Holy Girl of Peroblasco.
Yes. That was the name.
You must have been asked
so many questions about it.
I was a girl. I barely remember it.
And even if you could,
how do you explain a miracle?
- But there are no words, hmm?
- Of course there aren't.
I still remember
the day that we wrote to the bishop
to ask for someone
who could help us in our work.
[sighs] I'm so very pleased that...
that that turned out to be you,
Sister, of all people.
I am also very delighted.
[Mother] And also knowing
that you will be taking
your perpetual vows among us.
[ticking stops, clock echoes]
I'm sorry?
[Mother] The bishop thinks
that you are ready.
It would be an honour for us
to have you enter
into your union with our Lord here.
[Julia] As you have been told,
you will be teaching grammar,
literature, and natural sciences,
replacing Sister Inés.
[Mother] Poor Sister Inés had to leave us
to look after her elderly parents.
If you'll allow me, Mother, I can bring
Sister Narcisa here up to speed.
Please do.
You can go with Sister Julia.
You couldn't be in better hands.
[gentle breeze blowing]
"It would be impossible
to describe what I went through."
"All of my most simple thoughts
and actions became a source
of perturbation for me."
"I could only rest by declaring them
to Mary, which was difficult."
"As I felt obliged to tell her
even the most outrageous thoughts
that I had about her."
"Whenever I could lay down this burden,
I would savour a moment of peace."
"But that peace would end in a flash,
and my martyrdom would begin again."

[Narcisa] Hail Mary, the most pure.
[confessor] Conceived without sin.
[Narcisa] Forgive me,
Father, for I have sinned.
- [confessor] I am listening.
- I have just arrived here as a teacher.
And...
[hesitates]...and I don't know
if I'm ready.
[confessor] It's normal
to be frightened at first.
It will go well. You'll see.
[Narcisa] It's not that, Father.
There... [takes a deep breath]
There's something else.
[quietly] I...
[shudders]
I have doubts.
Many, many doubts.
[confessor] You? The Holy Girl?
[takes a deep breath] Don't be surprised.
The sisters have spoken of nothing else
for days.
I understand.
Was it the Blessed Mother
who asked you to take your vows?
No. No, that was my choice.
I felt like it... was my duty.
People came from all over
to see me in the village, and...
and to ask me questions.
I didn't know how to respond.
[confessor] You wanted
to get away from everyone.
[inhales sharply] I thought
that if I went far away, if...
[crying]...if I could just live a quiet,
tranquil life, then... she'd come again.
[confessor] Heaven has bestowed
a gift upon you.
You have come
to this convent for a reason.
You must work out what it is.
You must do so
through prayer and sacrifice.
Do you mortify your body?
Do you use the discipline?
Yes. Every day.
And... [sniffles]
And I practise fasting frequently.
[confessor] And yet,
you still... have doubts?
And... what If I only saw what I wanted?
What if what I saw...?
What if... What if what I saw wasn't her?
If she could
at least give me a sign, anything.
Do you understand me, Father?
I understand, child.
You are lost.
[girls chattering]
[door closes heavily]
[chatter dies down]
[bell jingles]
Let us pray.
Blessed be thy purity.
May it be blessed forever.
[class] For no less than God takes delight
in such exalted beauty.
[Narcisa] To you,
Heavenly Princess, Holy Virgin Mary.
[class] I offer to you, on this day,
all my heart, life, and soul.
Look upon me with compassion,
and do not leave me, my Mother.
You may sit down.
- [bell rings]
- [chairs scrape]
[desks clatter]
First, let me introduce myself.
My name is...
[students murmuring]
[girl 1] She's writing...
Silence, girls. What's wrong with you?
[whispers fade]
[whispering continues]
[tense music playing]
[girl 2] What? She's writing.
[murmuring grows louder]
[music intensifies]
That's enough!
[silence falls]
Will someone explain what is going on?
I don't want to start
by giving out punishments,
but if you continue like this,
then, believe me, I will.
I hope that's been made clear.
Yes?
May I be excused, please?
- What is your name?
- Rosa.
If you please, Sister.
Rosa, we've just started. What's wrong?
Sister, I'm sorry.
[girl 3] Oh no. What's happened?
[Rosa] I'm very sorry.
[students murmuring]
Of course. You can leave.
[Rosa breathing shakily]
[door opens, closes]
[girl 4] Sister?
Can I go with her?
Does she not know where she's going?
She's my sister.
Okay.
[door opens]
[Mother] Do you know who that is?
No.
It's actually me.
The day I was anointed a bride of Christ.
- Oh really?
- [chuckles]
Did you think that a servant of God
could not have once
been young and beautiful?
[Narcisa chuckles]
If I had not chosen a life serving God,
I could have been a dancer in a cabaret.
[both laugh]
But our dear Lord had other plans
for this particular servant.
Look.
So beautiful.
You can't find fabric like that anymore.
[sighs]
Look. Sister Inés.
So tiny.
Is that...?
I think it is.
Can you please wait there a moment?
Where did I put it?

[Mother] And you found this in the cellar?
- [Narcisa] Yes, Mother.
- And... you were down there because...?
Um... uh...
I heard some noise.
And I suppose I thought one of the girls
was hiding down there, and...
[Julia] You suppose you thought?
Uh, to be honest, Mother,
I don't know why I went there.
[Mother] Our Lady was guiding you.
There's no doubt about it.
[Mother] The hand of Saint Martha.
[sighs]
It's been presumed lost since the war.
This place has obviously never been
the same after that happened.
But then, my dear, you arrive.
[chuckles softly] That is no miracle.
When the bishop finds out...
Sisters, let us pray.
Let us give our thanks.
[ominous music playing]
[all together] Hail,
Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy.
Our life, our sweetness, and our hope.
To thee do we cry,
poor banished children of Eve.
To thee do we send up our sighs,
mourning and weeping
in this valley of tears.
Turn, then, most gracious advocate,
thine eyes of mercy towards us.
And after this, our exile, show unto us
the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
[music fades]
CHAPTER II
IF SHE WRITES YOUR NAME, YOU ARE CURSED
[footsteps approaching]
[Sagrario whispering] Now, wait a minute.
What has happened here?
Why is that in there? It's not right.
And neither's this one.
How has this happened?
- Sister, are you still working?
- [Sagrario gasps]
[Narcisa] It's nearly midnight.
[scoffs] Those girls. They are all wrong.
All the orders.
And they need to go out in the morning.
But the trays are full.
They're all mixed up. Don't you see?
Bite into it.
[exhales]
Rose water?
And this?
[Narcisa] Mm.
[sighs]
Do I detect a liquor?
The secret ingredient.
[Narcisa chuckles]
[Sagrario coughs]
I'm going to have to spend the whole night
sorting out this mess of theirs.
I can help if you want, Sister.
Thank you, my dear Sister Inés.
[scoffs] That's all we need,
the honey in with the specialities.
They spend all their time
thinking about boys
and end up doing everything
all over the place.
How can I tell which one's a speciality?
By trying.
Please.
No!
What are you doing?
The specialities must be eaten in a bite!
Swallow.
[Narcisa swallows heavily]
[coughs]
Have another.
- They go in pairs.
- No, I really don't...
I said the specialities
are eaten in pairs!
[ominous music playing]
[speciality squelches]
[disconcerting laughter]
[Narcisa gags]

[nun] Good morning, girls.
[knocking on door]
[door creaks open]
- [both] Good morning, Sister.
- [Narcisa] Good morning, girls.
You have beautiful hair. What a shame.
- A shame? Why?
- When you become a nun, they'll cut it.
Like they did to the others.
[high-pitched ringing]
[girl] Don't look at it.
- [girls] Good morning, Sister.
- [Narcisa] Good morning.
[students chattering]
[chairs squeak]
- [girl] Good morning, Sister.
- [class] Good morning, Sister.
Where are the other girls?
[girl] It's Wednesday.
- And?
- [girl] It's laundry day.
Oh.
The school washes the bed linen
from hostels and hotels across the city.
We also do laundry for families
who donate money to the school.
Our parents say that this will help us
find a good post when we leave.
- Or a good husband.
- [birds singing]
Leave it, Sister. You mustn't help us.
I've got hands, haven't I?
[girls] If Sister Julia sees you helping,
there'll be hell to pay.
Okay. I don't want to cause any trouble.
- Rosa.
- Yes, Sister?
What happened yesterday in class?
I suppose... I was scared.
What do you mean?
- [both] The blackboard.
- What do you mean, the blackboard?
- When you wrote your name.
- Quiet.
What?
Nothing.
- We have to go, Sister.
- [Rosa] Bye-bye.
[nuns] Glory be to the Father
and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.
As it was in the beginning
is now and will be forever.
Amen.
Hail Mary, Mother of Grace,
Mother of Mercy.
In life and in death,
protect us, your children.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among all women,
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among all women,
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.
[tense music playing]

Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners

Amen.

The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among all women,
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
- [music cuts out]
- Sister.
[nuns continue praying]
[Julia] I have to help Mother Superior
when we finish.
Do you think you'd be able to supervise
final prayers for the girls tonight?
- Of course, Sister.
- Thank you.
["Tengo una debilidad"

[floorboards creak]
- [bolero music grows louder]
- [girls giggling]
What are you doing?
Have you gone mad?
- If Mother Superior finds out...
- [girl 1] We weren't doing anything wrong.
Sister, you mustn't tell her. Please.
We just wanted to learn.
If we don't, then what will we do
at a ball when we leave the convent?
We might just look
like big trolls, Sister.
It's very late, girls.
Complines have been said,
so you must be silent now.
[girl 2] But we're not nuns, Sister.
- Hmm.
- And you're not a full nun, are you?
[girls giggle and whisper]
Please. A few steps?
Oh no. Not for me, no.
Surely you went to lots of dances
before you came here, didn't you?
[girl 3] Come on, Sister. Try it.
[girl 2] We won't tell anyone.
[Narcisa sighs]
- Yes, all right. Come here.
- [girls giggle]
Now, get into pairs. Very good.
Two steps to the right
and two to the left.
- [girl] Mm!
- [Narcisa] Let's go.
[girls chattering and giggling]
[lively bolero music continues]
[girl 4] Ow!
- [song ends]
- [girls applaud]
Shh! Girls, girls, girls! Hush. Hush.
Enough. Time for bed. Yes.
- [girls whine]
- Yes, yes. It's late, girls.
- [girl 5] It's not that late.
- It's time for bed. Come on.
[girls] Heavenly Father.
I thank thee for another day of life.
For the air I breathe.
For the peace that thou give me.
For always being with me.
My guide and my protective shield.
I pray for our salvation.
[girl 6] Amen.
Good night. Sleep well, girls.
[girls] Goodnight, Sister Narcisa.
- [girl 6] Good night.
- Good night, Rosa.
Good night Elvira.
[Narcisa] Blessed art thou
among all women,
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
- [crickets chirping]
- [girl, quietly] Rosa?
Rosa.
Rosa!
- [Rosa] What?
- [girl] I can't hold it any longer.
I'm going to wet myself.
[Rosa] Go to sleep.
Would you come
with me to the bathroom, Rosa?
No, I'm sorry.
It's too cold.
Oh please. I'm begging you.
I so don't want to go alone.
All right, then.
- I'll go.
- [rustling]
[girl] What's wrong?
[Rosa] What was that?
What?
[Rosa breathing shakily]

[Rosa] She's coming.
[gasps]
She's coming for you.

No. Now I don't want to go.
[ominous music playing]
[distant crack]

[Narcisa] And heighten

So that I am able to see clearly
and strengthen...
- [loud thwack]
- ...my will.
- [gasps]

[Narcisa] Show me thy face,
Lord, and help me to grow
spiritually and always fulfil...
thy will to not fall into...
[gasps softly]
...temptation.
[inhales sharply]
[tense music playing]
[shudders]
- [water dripping]
- [girl] Turn the tap on.
[Rosa] Hurry up.
[girl] Please. Otherwise, I can't go.
You're taking ages.

- [water running]
[girl] Thank you.
[unsettling music playing]
I feel so much better.

- What do you mean, the Girl?
- [door rattles]
- [Julia] Enough! To bed. Come on. Come on.
- [Rosa gasps]
- [girls crying]
[Julia] What you have done
is unforgivable.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
- Rosa, where did you get those scissors?
- [Rosa] I haven't done anything.
- Don't lie to me
- [Rosa] It was the Girl.
I promise I'm not lying.
She appeared in the bathroom.
In the water.
She was drowning and asking for help...
[gasps]
[breathing shakily]
Go back to your room, Sister.
I will take care of this.
- But the...
- Listen, Sister. It is still early.
We don't all have to lose our sleep
because of these good-for-nothing girls.
[hesitates] Of course.

SISTER SOCORRO ALBELDA
BORN 1917, DECEASED 1936
[Narcisa] Blessed be thy purity.
May it be blessed always.
[class] For no less than God takes delight
in such exalted beauty.
[Narcisa] To you,
Heavenly Princess, Holy Virgin Mary...
[class] I offer to you, on this day,
all my heart, life, and soul.
Look upon me with compassion,
and do not leave me, my Mother.
[door opens]
[water dripping]
Rosa?
[Rosa] Sister.
[gentle piano music playing]
I came to give you this.
But Sister Julia said
that until I see sense, I must fast.
Rosa, tell the truth to me.
Where did you get those scissors?
I didn't get them from anywhere.
They were already in the bathroom.
I swear.
And you said there was a girl?
You said that you'd seen her.
You said there was a girl in the water.
You won't talk?
It doesn't matter what I say.
It does matter.
I want to know the truth.
That's what Sister Inés said.
But after I told her,
she didn't want to believe us.
And what did you tell her?
That there's a spirit here.
It's a girl.
And you mustn't play with her.
Or touch her paintings.
Sister Inés, she drew the last leg
on a game of hangman
to show us that nothing would happen.
But then the girl wrote her name.
Sister Inés left.
She was really scared.
What do you mean that she wrote her name?
If your name appears...
[softly]...it means you are cursed.
Come on. Don't look like that.
Sister Inés would have been so delighted
that you're wearing her dress
on the happiest day of your life.
Would have been?
If she could see you. But she's not here.
[clock ticking]
- [Narcisa] Mother.
- Tell me, child.
Did she leave because she was afraid?
Well. [sighs]
I see they have told you their story.
The girls simply...
The girls have too much free time
and make up fantasies.
If Sister Inés had done what I said
and exerted a little bit more discipline,
it would have been better for everyone.
Don't follow in her footsteps.
Don't make the same mistake.
We just need to take it out a bit here,
though that'll be easy.
Sister Marcela is very skilled
in these things.
Please wait. Let me fetch her
so she can take your measurements now.

"The most notable details
can be observed without a telescope."
"In a lunar eclipse,
it is interesting to note the moment
in which you can first see
the dark shadow."
"Observing its gradual invasion
over the brilliant surface of the moon."
Yes, Vinyet?
- And so then, it's just nighttime?
- [Narcisa] No, not completely.
But that will be the case elsewhere.
Here, we will still see
a bit of light though.
Either way, it will be a very special day.
I don't want to see it. I'm scared to.
Well, Ana Mari, Sister Julia said
you can go blind if you look at it.
Mm. Well, Sister Julia is right.
Hmm?
You need to be careful.
But don't be scared.
Elvirita, please continue.
"Often, an even more interesting
and magnificent spectacle takes place."
"Although the moon is hidden
behind the earth,
so that not a single ray of sunlight
can reach the surface of the moon,
we can observe
that the moon often remains visible,
presenting a subtle, coppery glow
that is enough to distinguish
various marks on the surface."
"But where does this light come from?"
"It comes from the rays of the sun
that have managed
to reach the surface of the earth."
"In doing so, they have bent,
due to deflation in the atmosphere,
turning back to the shadow."
"These rays have crossed through
an enormous density
of the earth's atmosphere."
[Elvira continues, muffled]
- [chalk clacking and scraping]
- [tense music playing]
[Elvira]...that can be attributed
to the effect produced by the density
of the earth's atmosphere on...
[music swells]
[music fades]
[door opens]
[class whispering]
Sister...
[unsettling music playing]
[music swells]
[class murmuring]
- Silence! Now!
- [murmuring stops]
[tense music playing]
[Rosa crying softly]
[Narcisa] Rosa.
Rosa.
Rosa, it's just me.
There's no one else. I promise.
[Rosa sniffles]
[sighs]
Hiding away won't help you, my dear.
[Rosa continues crying softly]
[takes a deep breath] I believe you, Rosa.
- [Rosa gasps]
- I believe you.
- [gentle piano music playing]
- [Rosa sniffles, sighs]
[inhales sharply] I...
I know that you saw her.
I believe you saw a little girl.
And I need you to help me see her, please.
- [Rosa sniffles]
- [softly] Please.
[macabre music playing]
[Narcisa] The drawing that Sister Inés
finished was like this one, wasn't it?
Yes.
No!
[music building]
Don't do it.
Rosa, it's all right.
I just... I just want to see.
I won't let anything happen to you.
You can trust me.
[Narcisa exhales]
Help me see her. Please, Rosa.
[Rosa sniffles]
- [sniffles]
- Let's do it together.
[Rosa] Heavenly Father,
I am faithfully asking
for the protection of your armour
so that I can stand firm
in the face of Satan and his followers.
[both] And overcome them
in the name of Jesus Christ.
- [music fades]
- [Rosa breathing shakily]
[ominous music playing]
- [music fades]
- [Narcisa panting]
[swallows, exhales]
[softly] Nothing.
See for yourself, Rosa. Nothing happened.
Rosa, listen,
if you could maybe ask yourself...
- [chair clatters]
- [tense music playing]
[high-pitched ringing]
[Rosa breathing shakily]
[softly] She's here.
[tense music swells]
[Rosa, whispering] She's right there.
Why can't you see her?
Rosa, there's no one there.
- There's no girl.
- Do not move.
She's behind you, Sister.
But it's not a girl.
[ominous music playing]
[Rosa] She's saying something.
[faint knocking]
[Narcisa] What is she saying?
[rolling object clattering]
[Narcisa] Rosa, I can't hear her.
Please, tell me what she's saying.
Rosa!
[music fades]
Rosa?
[pulsating synth beat echoing]
[muffled] Rosa?
Rosa!
Rosa!
Rosa?
Rosa!
[clotheslines strain]
[Narcisa] Have you seen Rosa?
- Has anybody seen Rosa?
- [Elvira] What's happened?
- [Narcisa] Where's your sister?
- [Elvira] No.
[Narcisa] Help me find her.
Check the kitchen.
- Rosa! Rosa!
- [Narcisa sobs, whimpers]
- [Julia] What's all this commotion?
- Rosa. I can't find her.
[Julia] Your protégée has disappeared.
- Huh?
- [Julia] You don't understand.
The more you believe her lies,
the worse things will get.
Sister, I don't think
that she has been lying.
I think... I think
that the girl and the drawings...
Sister, there's actually truth in...
[laughs mockingly] Look at that.
Now we know
why the Holy Girl decided to join us here.
- You want to solve a mystery, don't you?
- [gasps]
You want to get in the papers again!
Let me tell you something.
I don't believe you.
I have seen you pray and take communion.
You practise the motions
and you say the words,
but it's all a fabrication.
Oh, it's a sin for someone like you
to take vows, so just get out of here!
This is no place for you.
You might have fooled us
all those years ago,
but now that I know you,
I know it was all a lie!
Or maybe it wasn't,
and in actual fact
what you saw was the devil!
- [clock ticking]
- Rosa!
She's been taken! Just like Sister Inés.
Don't say that, Elvirita.
You mustn't say that.
She'll just be scared
and hiding somewhere.
We must keep searching.
- Where do...
- [Rosa whispering]
[quickly] For no less than God
takes delight in such exalted beauty.
Blessed be thy purity.
May it be blessed always.
For no less than God takes delight
in such exalted beauty.
Rosa.
[Rosa] Blessed be thy purity.
May it be blessed always.
For no less than God takes delight
in such exalted beauty.
Blessed be thy purity.
May it be blessed always.
- For no less than God takes delight...
- [Narcisa] Rosa.
- [door rattles]
- [Rosa] Blessed be thy purity,
[Narcisa] Rosa!
[grunts] Rosa!
[gasps]
[breathing shakily]
- [tense music blasts]
- [gasps, grunts]
- [grunts]
- [door rattling]
[Narcisa screaming]
- Sister!
- [Narcisa] Open the door!
I'll go and get help! Just wait!
- [music fades]
- [confessor, echoing] Hail Mary.
[Narcisa] Father?
Is that you?
[confessor] Don't you recognise me?
You think this is one of your nightmares.
[Narcisa] No. No, this is real.
I just want to find Rosa.
[confessor] You took advantage
of that poor girl.
You wanted to know.
You wanted to see.
[crying] I have to escape this darkness.
[distorted voice, echoing]
You don't always need eyes to see.
[faint knocking]
[Narcisa] You're not...
Who's there?
[girl giggles]
[Narcisa] I said, who's there?
[bench creaks]
[man's voice, echoing] You know who I am.
- [distorted, macabre music playing]
- [voices cackling]
[Julia] You're part of this.
- [Narcisa shrieks]
- [distorted voices echoing]
[Julia] It's a sin
for someone like you to take vows.
[Narcisa screams]
[groaning]
[distorted voices shouting]
[Narcisa gasps, choking]
- [Julia] This is no place for you.
- [shouts echo]
[screams fade]
[Narcisa panting]
[Rosa] Blessed be thy purity.
May it be blessed always.
For no less than God takes delight
in such exalted beauty.

CHAPTER III
SISTER SOCORRO
[all] The Lord is my shepherd.
- I shall not want.
- [gentle piano music playing]
[all] He makes me lie down
in green pastures.
He leads me beside still waters,
and he restores my soul.
He leads me in the paths of righteousness.
For his name's sake.
Goodness and mercy,
all my life, shall surely follow me.
And in God's house forevermore,
my dwelling place shall be.
He leads me beside still waters,
and he restores my soul.
He leads me in the paths of righteousness.
I shall not want for his name's sake.
The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.
The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.
He makes me lie down in green pastures.
He leads me beside still waters,
and he restores my soul.
He leads me in the paths of righteousness.
[quietly] She put her trust in you,
and now she's dead.
Like I said, you don't belong here.
If only you had listened to me,
we could have avoided this tragedy.

[mourners] Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among all women,
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done
on Earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us, this day, our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
Amen.

[shrieks]
- [music fades abruptly]
- Calm, Sister. Calm down.
[switch clicks]
- Can you see the light?
- [Narcisa, weakly] Yes, I see it.
But it doesn't bother you
that I'm shining it in your eyes?
[Narcisa] No. [sighs]
You did this to yourself.
It is neither repentance nor penance.
It's an act of arrogance.
[gasps] I saw
what happened during the war.
Before the liberation. [crying]
- What?
- [Narcisa] When you touched me.
Suddenly I was there,
and the... the smashed saints, the relics...
And that's not all. I saw what happened.
I saw what they did to one of the sisters.
She was lying...
[Julia] Shut up!
You don't know.
You can't know anything. How could you?
Don't touch me!
You're not going to play your demon tricks
on my mind.
Look after yourself and leave us in peace.

[ominous music playing]
[Sagrario] Hail, Holy Queen,
Mother of Mercy.
Our life, our sweetness,
and all of our hope.
To thee do we cry,
poor banished children...
[Narcisa] Sister Sagrario.
...banished children of Eve.
[music building]
[Narcisa] I know you're there.
Why won't you answer?
[bed creaks]
[Narcisa] What are you scared of?
Sister, in the wardrobe,
you will find a cigar box.
Go and get it.
[cigar box scrapes]
Open it.
[lid clatters]
Inside, you will find a photograph.
[papers rustle]
[Sagrario] Sister Socorro.
[takes a deep breath]
Give it me.
Please give it.
[inhales sharply]
[tense music playing]
It's her.
Sister Socorro.
- [clock ticking]
- [man panting]
[belt buckle jingles]
[Socorro inhales sharply]
[man grunting]
Because this was her cell. She was here.
Sister, leave it now, please.
- [Socorro] No, please.
- [man grunting]
[Socorro] Please, stop, sir. I beg you.
[man grunting]
No.
[Narcisa] They didn't say anything
about what happened.
Please leave it.
Please.
And the girl.
...full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed... [gasps]
Blessed art thou among all women,
and blessed is the fruit...
[screams in pain]
[screaming intensifies]
[screams echoing]
[crying] Only the sisters knew about it.
Please. No, no.

Mummy!

Let me see her! [crying hysterically]
- [girl] Mummy!
- What's all this noise about?
- The mother.
- Mummy!
Because we've had to lock her in her cell.
She was insisting on
taking the girl to hospital.
[sobbing, shouts] She's mine!
[Mother] We need to bring down her fever.
- She could die.
- [Sagrario] Quickly, Sister.
[sinister music playing]

She needs to go to the hospital.
Please open the door.
Open it, open it.
Please help me.
Just open it.
[splutters] Open it.
Sister, I am here. I will help.

Through my fault,
through my most grievous fault.

Girls, could I please ask
for some silence and your attention?
20 MARCH 1991
Because... I want you
to give a very warm welcome
to someone who is really special to me.
When I was about your age
and I was a novice,
she was the one who helped me understand
that the convent was not my true calling.
But that I was better suited
to helping others through teaching.
Now we have the fortune
to have her at our school
to teach us everything she knows,
which is a lot.
So, may I introduce you to Sister Narcisa?
- She'll be your new literature teacher.
- More like Sister Death. [chuckles]
[teacher] This is a great blessing,
and I trust that her lessons
will encourage you to put
your Super Pop magazines to one side.
Yes? And read more of the classics
from our literature.
We have the good fortune
to have some of the greatest writers...
