Starving.
Sex.
Sleep..
Three things are the basic things that humans and animals need.
But the thing that sets us apart from animals is emotions.
Butterflies on Bank Street.
Beautiful, right?
Yes, very beautiful.
But do you know?
If a butterfly flutters its wings ..
There are places in America that are about to be hit by a hurricane.
Is he sir?
Don't you know?
Come here.
Come on, come on everyone.
There is a butterfly.
And it has wings.
When he moves his wings, low pressure will form.
Because of the different pressure, the air will be added ...
..so that the existing air will get support ..
So a hurricane will form in America.
Interesting right?
Very interesting, sir.
Actually, why did I hit you just now?
We don't throw our cups in the trash.
Why do I want to hit you for that?
We've already thrown it away.
Get rid of it quickly.
Alamak ..
You're hurt.
Why do I act like that just because of a small problem?
Emotions don't match the situation.
It should have been shown elsewhere.
Where did that emotion come from?
Encik Abhiram.
You are so pretentious and arrogant!
You're out of my company.
Oh, it came from there.
I'm sorry sir. - What?
You were mad at me this morning, weren't you?
Yes.
I didn't react right away.
Certainly!
Because I had no reaction at all ..
..that emotion is in me and turns into anger.
And I hit other people.
So what?
Now I have no emotions.
No emotion. No enemies.
therefore..
You better let go of your emotions right away.
If we do not react to our anger or sadness ..
..that emotion will stay within and affect others.
And eventually we will be the ones who fail.
I have failed before.
I lost my job.
For those who failed like us..
I started this company.
The name of the company, is KMC.
I will only take 2 minutes to explain about this company.
That is my company.
If you all believe me ..
..please invest in this company.
What is the guarantee that this company will succeed?
Good question.
I will increase your bank balance 100 times in 2 minutes.
Then you will believe, right?
How?
Sudhir..
Sedia, Abhi..
This is the London stock market.
This is the value of the company's shares when the account is closed.
Next view ..
This is C-Gate Sottware Solutions.
My expectation is within 2 minutes after the market opens ..
..the stock of this company will go up 100 times.
Listen to me.
And invest your money in this company.
That's your money ..
..will increase 100 times in two minutes.
- Believe me. - Are you crazy?
Over 52 weeks the company’s market is among the lowest.
How do you think the price will go up?
If I'm not mistaken ..
You are Kamal Shival, right?
Yes.
And your bank balance is only 1 pound.
Yes.
If you lose that 1 pound ..
..your life won't be a mess.
No.
But you will get the answer with only 1 pound.
1 pound you have ..
So invest in C-Gate Company.
Come on everyone. What are you waiting for?
You only have 2 minutes. Invest in C-Gate.
Lima..
Four..
Three..
Two..
One..
How?
But how?
This is not a question. But the excitement.
There should be no answer for him.
Since then..
No one questions success.
- You are right! - Yes!
Is everything ready?
Start start .. Start start ..
Don't stop until the game is over.
Live, live..
Don't stop until you swim.
Don't stop until luck knocks on your door.
Don't stop swimming until the ship can save you
Don't stop until you get enough.
Don't stop until you get enough.
Don't stop until you get enough.
Don't stop until you get enough.
If you have any doubts.
Ask and relieve your emotions.
How did C-Gate Company’s stock suddenly soar 100-fold?
- You know Raj Patel? - Know. The richest Indian in the UK.
He recently bought 40% of the shares of C-Gate Company.
Why does he have to buy it?
His secretary cum his girlfriend who forced him to sign.
Why did he ask for a signature?
Because I saved her son from an accident.
You are willing to take risks.
- It's just a graph. - Graphics? What is that?
This was taken while I was crossing the street.
There are no buses.
- This is a recording of the last bus. - There are no slaves.
That's why I put the 2 recordings together and made them graphics.
And this is the result.
You should save Raj Patel's son.
Why the secretary's son?
He would have asked for this matter under investigation if it was his son.
He would be quiet if it was his girlfriend's daughter.
Don't stop thinking that they have given up on you.
Because they don't know you're a marigold.
Don't stop thinking they've beaten you.
Because they don't know you're like running water.
Don't stop thinking that you have their support.
Because they don't know you are a seed that will grow tall.
Be a seed and grow into a tree.
Be the tide and the height of your waves.
Be the wind high in the sky.
Don't stop until you get enough.
Don't stop until you get enough.
You are like drops and raindrops.
So why do you block the rain with an umbrella when it comes down?
You're like a sunburn.
So why are you looking for shade when the sun shines on you.
You are like the sound of the wind.
So why do you close the window when the wind is blowing.
Live the way you like.
Why do you cry when trouble comes.
Go against the flow and stand proud.
Don't stop until you get enough.
Don't stop until you get enough.
Don't stop until you get enough.
Don't stop until you get enough.
Abhi
Abhi..
Red phone.
Father is sick. The situation is serious.
Abhi, lompat.
Dad. Emotions that follow me all the time ..
Jump Abhi. Jump.
Come on ..!
Come on, Abhi ..
I see a variety of emotions in a lot of people.
But face various emotions with a smile ..
I only saw it on my father.
I don't know what my father's face looks like without a smile.
Love. Mom has come. Mom wants to come.
Good kid..
Do not Cry.
What about dad?
-Hi Abhi. - Nothing.
3 days ago he played with Sweety.
Suddenly my father fainted.
We remember the usual stomach ache.
She was having trouble breathing, so we took her to the hospital.
He is Dr. Vijay Mithra.
My younger sibling.
Hi..
He had Pancreatic Adenocarconoma. Final stage.
In this situation, each organ will begin to fail to function.
Sorry if I say..
He may have only a month and a half to live.
More or less so.
That's why my brother thinks it's better for him to stay at home in the last days.
So brother took him back.
Everything happens like in the movie.
Where's dad?
Father..
Why is dad sad?
Dad should be the happiest person.
We all have good jobs..
I have a Range rover.
My father's second child has a house in Lister Square.
Dad's youngest son had just set up a pipeline company.
Mr. Subramanyam’s son has value in society.
Who is responsible for all this?
Because my father worked hard to raise us.
Maybe you need to work hard.
..but you all don't have the need to live hard.
What..
Did you buy a Range rover?
When you were little you always went to school with a Ferrari.
And you..
You bought a 4 -room house.
You always play hide and seek in a 24-room castle.
..and there are 40 workers trying to find the three of you.
To teach him to play chess, there were 10 teachers lined up waiting their turn.
You are not the poor son of Subramanyam.
You are the son of the richest businessman in the Indian community in the UK.
Ramesh Chandra Prasad..
Right..
Father's name is Ramesh Chandra Prasad.
My dream is that every Indian in England should have his own home.
So I plan to build a world -class city with all the amenities.
If you trust me, invest.
Every penny you spend I will guarantee.
Great India in Britain.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Then someone cheated on dad.
He made the father a liar in front of everyone.
Great Indian construction company that builds ..
..buildings in the UK went bankrupt overnight.
Great India construction land was declared an Eco zone by the British government.
The person who always claps for dad..
..the same person had also driven father from there.
Dad, I'm hungry.
Ma'am, my child ..
Hungry.
Is there any bread?
- What is your name? - Subramanyam ..
- Where are you from? - India.
What is your job
I will do any work.
I remember when I was busy taking care of you all my life ..
..dad will forget the deception he did to you.
But..
She's still in pain here.
Only by cheating on him again can we get ourselves a father again.
Dad doesn't worry about dad's death.
Dad was worried that Dad would die without getting revenge on him.
Dad didn't want to die as a failed Subramanyam.
Dad wants to die as Ramesh Chandra Prasad.
Father..
Father. Father..
His name is Krishna Murthy.
Chairman of K-Group Company.
Is everything according to plan?
Ya, tuan.
I don't want construction to stop.
Make sure we get more of this stuff.
I want immediate delivery.
If not..
Who is that?
Krishna Murthy, sir. Mr. K, chairman of K-Group.
Will birds eat butterflies?
The bird's stomach was full of butterflies.
You know Kapil ..
A bird can stop a hurricane in America.
That's right.
That's the butterfly effect.
There's nothing wrong with birds eating butterflies.
And it's also not wrong if we save America.
Tell me, why do I need to hear all these stories now.
That's right. But remember this. We'll talk about this later.
Natural oil and gas.
I have been looking for it for 7 years and spent 70 million in Europe.
You're lucky. You found it on your own land.
Do not worry. I didn't kill anyone.
I will just win.
Let's play a game.
Two balls.
One has gold, and the other has silver.
If you choose the gold one ..
..you will win.
My choice is this.
Why do I want to play this game.
Because if you win, I'll go.
My guess is right.
You are stupid.
You don't have the ability to manage this project.
I will give you 20%, leave this project to me.
Forgive me.
What is all this? If you take 80% then I have to be scared of you?
And I'm not afraid of you.
I want you to remember something.
What was that thing?
About the effect of butterflies or something ..
You are not afraid of me.
But you will be afraid of butterflies.
Branch-branch?
Adnani coal mine in Australia.
The project is worth millions of dollars.
- Why was it stopped - Golden Green Frog.
Because of the frog ..
Do you know why?
Because ...
The frog was only found in that place.
And because of the project, rare snakes will become extinct.
So the government canceled the project.
There are only stones here.
Not bad.
You are smart enough ..
..for fear.
Giri. Newspaper.
This is tomorrow's newspaper.
“The people’s gas project will be an eco zone” is written in Spanish
Eco..
And this is the newspaper the day before yesterday.
"The people's gas project license was revoked by the Spanish government."
And this is the next day's newspaper.
"Investors are asking for their money back. Kapil Sinha ran away with their money."
Why do I want my license revoked And why do I want to run away?
Why do I want to change my identity. Why?
Because ...
They found butterflies that are rarely found here.
It means..
A very rare species.
If this project is continued.
The butterfly is in danger.
If they die the project will be stopped.
A rare butterfly?
Hey! Krishna Murthy..
There are no flowers here either.
How can there be butterflies?
Speak up.
That is my butterfly.
My butterfly.
My butterfly effect.
The butterfly-me effect.
I have researched about Krishna Murthy.
I have prepared the case documents.
We will be able to make a claim in court.
Dad don't worry.
We will take care of him.
Dad, take a break.
You just said the same thing my brother said.
So..
..my brother and I cheated on you. Like Krishna Murthy did.
Why do you think we want to cheat on dad?
I lied because I wanted to make my father happy.
Dad doesn't need my brother's deception now.
He wants to see the fall of Krishna Murthy.
What happened 20 years ago because of dad’s naivety.
So we want to retaliate against Krishna Murthy?
So we want revenge on Krishna Murthy?
What is your opinion?
That's right brother.
I will also deceive my father in this matter.
This revenge thing is just nonsense.
You just set up a company. You better handle it.
Nothing is more important to me than my father.
Don't talk like you're the only one who cares about dad.
A tourist going to the Taj Mahal will definitely be excited ..
..but not for the guards who see the Taj Mahal every day.
You only come to visit dad once in a while.
Don’t suddenly get emotional and talk out of excitement.
Sorry. Take a good look.
- I am sorry. - Sorry what?
Why are you smiling?
I can't control my emotions just because my shirt is exposed to coffee.
My brother kept scolding him.
And dad carried the same emotions for 20 years.
Before Dad dies, we have to get rid of that emotion.
Dad's face should have smiled after his death.
So?
You want to face Krishna Murthy?
Do you know who Krishna Murthy is?
The richest and most ruthless businessman in the UK.
It takes 300 days just to get an appointment. What are you going to do in 30 days?
Yes. lanya impossible.
Dad is counting the days.
It's not dad who counts the days.
Krishna Murthy.
Every breath I take is the moment of the downfall of Krishna Murthy.
Abhi..
Go eat first.
Krishna Murthy doesn't have much time left sister.
I only have 30 days.
30 days means 720 hours.
720 hours means 43200 minutes.
43200 minutes equals 2592000 seconds.
Harta kekayaan Krishna Murthy bernilai 35000 kror.
Each moment is worth 10 crore.
Zero operation.
This is the name of my mission to deceive Krishna Murthy.
I need 3 people to make it happen.
Why?
Is it because I'm fast typing?
No.
I love your tattoos.
Between me and your father. You choose!
Let me ask dad first.
- Oh, sorry. - Who is this?
My father. Thank you.
What time did I tell you all to come?
What time is it now?
10.31 forest.
So, you're a minute late.
Can you come at exactly 10.32?
Ya, tuan.
Time is calculated in seconds and minutes.
But I counted it according to my father's heartbeat.
From now on, the time you waste is not your time ..
But my time.
I only have 30 days.
Do you know why I chose you all for this mission?
Because there is one common qualification between the three of you.
That is, the three of you love your father.
Additional qualifications.
You are all former employees of Krishna Murthy's company.
Krishna Murthy.
Is a smart and fast thinker in the business arena in London.
Is a smart and fast thinker in the business arena in London.
Is a smart and fast thinker in the business arena in London.
Can I dig oil and gas out of the ground?
I want a release document in 24 hours.
I need details on his thoughts.
What he ate and drank.
How many hours did he sleep? How many hours does he work?
What clothes she wears and what perfume she uses.
What brand of wine. What pen is he using.
Did he laugh hearing the jokes. Will he get angry when he gets wind.
Has he ever hit people.
I want all the details.
What I mean is..
Every detail in detail.
He eats broccoli for breakfast.
So what are we waiting for again?
Bring me broccoli.
Is he eating at this time?
No sir. 12.30 am..
So serve at 12.30 later.
To defeat Krishna Murthy we have to know his business strategy and secrets.
Why do we need what he eats and what he drinks?
Every girl wants a man who has qualities like her father.
Elektro kompleks.
So I want to change myself like Krishna Murthy.
What do you mean?
Our first goal...
Daughter of Krishna Murthy.
He is a 40% shareholder of the company.
The watch he's wearing is probably ...
..worth 10 crore.
His name.
Divyanka.
Coffee..
Coffee.
Double Shot Cappuccino.
How do you know?
How do you know I want to order Double Shot?
A girl who missed her first coffee ..
..would have a strong..coffee for both coffees.
How do you know I missed my first coffee?
Girl typing her coffee cup..
..must miss the coffee in the early morning.
Are you trying to screw the girl you met by chance?
This is not a coincidence?
I'm planning on having coffee with you, that's why you're sitting here.
Forgive me?
Where should you be now?
At the Art Gallery.
So why are you here?
Because I didn't drink coffee this morning.
How did you miss your coffee?
Because the coffee machine is broken.
Why is it broken?
There is no electricity supply.
Precisely.
I cut off the electricity.
Because there was no electricity for 5 minutes.
You left the house 10 minutes late.
Due to being 10 minutes late, you will pass the school zone.
I don't want to wait for you to turn left.
500 meters ahead.
You just notice the road is being repaired and you turn left.
On the way there were protesters (gatherings).
And you took the long way to the art gallery.
This is the first coffee shop on the route.
So you're sharing coffee with me now.
So that's the story of why you missed your morning coffee.
I will not believe.
it's just a coincidence.
As it happens.
There are so many tables in the store but why did you choose this table?
Because only this table is empty.
I arranged them.
Why do all this?
To publish love between us.
You do not understand?
Easy.
You are like carbon. And I am also a carbon.
And there is a free flow of electricity in you and me.
If they are combined.
There must be a magical moment created between the two of us.
And for that we have to meet many times by chance.
Since I don't have much time ..
I will plan all our meetings.
So until you fall in love with me, when and where will I meet you ..
..you will come and meet me by chance.
Okay.
Tomorrow try to see me ..
..and I will try not to run into you.
Hello. - Hi, Divya.
My car broke down. I am at home.
Please come pick me up.
- Please. - All right.
Thank you.
- I'm tired. - Shivani, whatever happens today.
Hey, stop. There are puppies there.
Cute puppy.
Hey, puppy. Really cute.
Sparky. Nice name.
Hey there. - Number 36.
Try checking. - Yes, that is correct.
Hey, Sparky!
Who is that?
You go. I'll come later.
What about this time? Uninterrupted electricity supply in the house.
This time it's not your house without electricity.
But at your friend's house.
Because his car can't be started.
He called you and told you to pick him up.
On the way you see a puppy.
Because your friend really likes puppies.
You two are trying to find the address.
So again you will share coffee with me.
What if my friend ..
..don't call me.
What if he took a taxi.
So..
We met by chance.
This is better.
Look here, Divya.
Your friend didn't call a taxi, so we could have coffee together.
Something that happens naturally.
Will determine a situation elsewhere.
Everything is related to each other.
For example.
The position of this coffee cup is placed on the table.
..and they just sit and chat.
And he took pictures.
By the time it happens, something is happening in a different way.
So..
It's like we sit here and drink coffee.
Maybe your father is sitting drinking coffee somewhere else.
And may lose all his belongings.
How?
Because he faces northeast.
If he moves his desk exactly 42 degrees to the east ..
His wealth must have doubled.
So you mean, because the position of this cup is like this ..
..can't we create love between us?
If the cup is like this ..
Just a second.
- You won't do that. Why?
Because you might kiss me.
What?
Why do you love me?
Duit.
Because of your money.
You are the daughter of a millionaire.
You have 40% of the company's shares.
Okay, you tell me.
As long as you have money.
Would you believe me if I told you another reason?
Certainly not.
Even though I really love you ..
..you might think I'm chasing your money.
That's why I give you reasons that you will believe.
You think selfishness will create a sense of love between us ..
What's his name?
Carbon material, electric, at magic.
Love has already begun.
When did it start?
The time you kissed me just now.
How can you say that.
I can read your thoughts.
Really?
Want to try?
Okey.
Big.
Hold out your hand.
Close your eyes.
Soothe your body, mind and soul.
Just calm down.
I can hear a sound.
Trolley. Beg.
Trolley. Beg.
There are a lot of people.
Announcement.
Very noisy sound.
lanya train.
No. No. Wait.
lanya plane.
Now, everything is very clear.
Airport.
Little girl.
She was crying.
Screaming called his mother.
Someone grabbed his hand and held it.
Shivani.
The young man is weird.
He told me about my dream.
Until now I never told my father about my dream.
Really? - Yes.
But the puppy is really cute.
Oh, God..! All this because of the puppy.
You know ... I smelled him.
Did you kiss him? What kind?
Suddenly a camera light flashed.
There is basketball. The waiter spilled coffee.
And I smelled him.
I do not understand.
Now..
Everything in this world is connected.
At the moment it happens in one place naturally ..
..will determine another moment elsewhere.
For example.
When I change the direction of my coffee cup ..
- Sorry, ma'am. - It's fine. It's ok.
Sorry, ma'am.
Sorry.
What happened Divya.
Nothing. Just a second.
Try to avoid seeing me tomorrow.
If we meet, it means we are in love.
He's a message.
He said that if we meet tomorrow by chance it means love.
Now what kind?
He doesn't know if I've read his message or not.
Because my phone doesn't have a "blue tick"
Yes, okay. Just a second.
Now you stand in front of the mirror.
And look at your birthmark on your left waist.
No. You are wrong.
Yes, speak up.
What? Okay. Okay. Just a second.
The girl who replied to the second message must have read the first message.
Shivani, bye.
Try to avoid meeting tomorrow.
If we meet, it means we are in love.
Stop at a coffee shop.
Okey.
No. No. Not the first store. But the second.
Thank you. - Thank you.
How?
Easy.
I'm just following you.
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.
Oh beautiful girl.
Wherever you go, it's because of me ..
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.
Oh sweet, naughty girl.
Your address is in my heart. I can say for sure.
Your address is in my heart. I can say for sure.
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.
Like a signal following a cell phone, I always follow you.
Yesterday, today and tomorrow.
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.
Oh beautiful girl.
Wherever you go, it's because of me ..
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.
Party here. The party is here.
Dance.
Party here. The party is here.
When you go to the coffee shop, I'm the cup there.
When he touches your lips, I am his insert.
When your heart beats, I'm the beat.
If you go and shake your waist, I'll be your friend.
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.
I want your tail. I want to follow you.
Like a cat drinking milk with its eyes closed.
Don't think I didn't see you, girl.
Remind yourself like an arrow, don't get so excited.
The one who released you from the bow was me.
Nothing can take you out of my sight.
Not Krishna, Jesus or God.
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.
I want to follow you. I want to follow you.
So you love me.
I told you ..
If we meet the third time there must be love.
Do you know what this is?
Carlos Ross and his famous butterfly painting.
lanya cantik.
My father really liked this painting.
After 20 years it will be auctioned.
I really like my dad.
I want to give him this painting as a gift and give him a surprise.
But because of you ..
Three times I missed going to the gallery.
And the painting is gone.
The auction is over.
So thank you so much for you.
I missed the painting.
So, I was so intrigued that you missed the painting.
Do you know what caught my eye the most?
Maybe you're a witch.
You can probably read my mind, can predict my future.
We only get excited when magicians do all this.
But will not fall in love.
Love cannot exist by planning it.
If we are destined to meet, no one can stop it.
In fact, nature will also help bring us closer.
Air, sky ..
..that tree, that puppy.
Everything.
So, bye.
All of you.
I need the painting right away.
- Go find it. - Yes, boss. Okay.
Krishna Murthy has hired an advocate.
Answers for the defense have also been made.
The case will be heard soon.
We've gathered all the evidence.
I'm sure we will win.
Dad has a friend named Satpal Singh.
He does the land business.
See if he can help in this case.
I'll see him dad.
Don't cry, baby.
- What kind of father? Brother, tell me well.
If dad makes only 10% of what brother told me..
..I can imagine an old story.
He did not tell Subramanyam.
But he told Ramesh Chandra Prasad.
If you knew we cheated on him ..
..of course he feels worse than what Krishna Murthy has done to him.
Yes, that is correct.
Brother is just telling a story. So you tell me what you should do.
You said you wanted to deal with Krishna Murthy.
But you can't even manage his own child.
What are you going to do with Krishna Murthy?
So talk when you've done something.
Then my brother will stop telling my father.
Neelima ..! Serve the food to Abhi.
He has a lot of free time.
Come on, dad, tell me a story. Once upon a time, there was a man named Abhi ..
I think you're right, brother. Look, Sweety isn't crying anymore.
Boss, the painting is here.
Nice. It looks like an original painting.
How does the boss know this is a fake carving?
- Doesn't look like a scratch on this wing? - We saw the boss.
- What color? - Cobalt blue.
Two hundred years ago there was no cobalt blue.
It only appeared after that.
And this painting is 200 years old.
So this may not be an original painting.
No one else can guess this is not an original painting other than the boss.
Okay, let's just share this one, boss.
Does it matter if it is genuine or fake when we actually want to deceive them?
I have no plans to deceive Divyanka.
Only his father..
If I give him this painting ..
..she will give it to her father.
And it was as if Divya was cheating on her father.
And I don't like it.
We can find out who bought the painting.
But he asked for 25 crore.
Whatever the cost, I want an original painting.
- Hello. - Divya..
I have the painting you want.
For the past few days you remember ..
..you missed this painting for meeting me.
But now, if you don't find me, you'll miss it.
I'm waiting for you at my place.
Dengan Cappucino "Double Shot"
See you later.
Nice try.
Encik Abhiram.
Once you do it may look interesting.
When you do it again, it looks shocking.
The third time you made it look like a fool.
Where are you now?
You know where I'm going if you've planned it.
I know you're in the car in the back.
Divya..
Divya..
Someone is trying to kidnap Divya.
Let go! Let go..
He kidnapped Divya using a plan we made.
So..
If they imitate our plan, that means ..
..they will probably go to the coffee shop first.
Coffee shop 1
Here we put 30 people.
Surely he was one of them.
Coffee shop 2.
Here, one of the 30 earlier...
..he is there.
He pretends to take a wedding, but he takes a picture of Divya.
Why is he trying to trap Divya, boss?
Did he kidnap Divya for money?
It's too big for him.
Something small.
Got it.
When he came to the coffee shop 2 ..
He didn't take a picture of Divyanka, but a picture of his watch.
I told you, it costs 10 crore.
If he wants a watch ..
..he will take his watch and leave Divya.
But they brought Divya once.
I think they will rape her.
So we have to find where they will take Divya, boss.
If we want to know ..
..we got to the place where Divya was kidnapped.
You know where I'm going if you've planned it.
Divya's place of abduction is between coffee shop 1 and coffee shop 2.
Because he got into the school zone.
Definitely at the coffee shop 1.
Where is the place where there is no CCTV on the route?
- On the bridge. - Good. We start from there.
To the left of the surveillance camera. Security checks.
On the right there is only a bus route, normal vehicles cannot pass.
The right road is closed.
They must have turned left.
The sound of an ambulance.
The kidnapper may be speeding.
..so there is a possibility of an accident.
-Kate?-Ya, tuan.
Impact if there is any accident at a nearby location.
How about you? What happen?
A car hit him.
is it black? - Yes black car. He went that way.
Take care of him.
The impression of the water heading west.
The mouth of the bottle may have been rotated 55-degrees to the south.
So, they must be heading north.
We got the watch and the girl.
Good. Careful.
Bring him.
Kate..
lanya personal number. I need another number.
Kate, try to trace the number. - Sir, I tried, I'm so sorry.
- What? - I got the signal.
- Call me. - I can connect it, boss.
Connect me on the phone.
- Just do it. - Lanya rang the boss.
Hello? - Hello Abhi..
Divya..
Divya, can you hear me?
Divya..
Divya, can you hear my voice?
Divya, where are you?
- There are a lot of cars here, Abhi. - I haven't heard Divya.
Lots of cars ..
Give me a clue. A little hint, please.
Divya, just give me one hint.
Chur, Churchill Street - What?
What? Divya, speak up.
Divya..
Churchill Street.
He's mine.
Are you okay
Divya, stop.
Turn the shoe 45 degrees.
Counter clockwise.
Abhi..
Divya, don't. I will tell you everything.
There is a lot to discuss.
Divya, don't be afraid.
Suddenly a car came. He almost hit the boy.
I saved the boy. The car hit me.
I fell. But when I open my eyes and I see ..
I saw your shoes.
That little dog..
Bite that shoe and run.
I chased behind him.
That dog told me where you were.
You are right Divya. I understand now.
This is not a plan but a destiny, Divya.
Nature helps us.
Rain.
The wind, the baby and the dog...
I don't have to plan to see you.
Because I love you.
Listen. Listen ..
Look into my eyes, feel my heart.
He will tell you something that words cannot express.
Hold my hand, don't let go.
I want to hear that you will live for me.
My heart to you..
And your heart is on me.
Caught with each other.
My heart to you.
And your heart is on me.
Stick to each other as if in an arrow.
Don't you leave me dear.
You are destined to love me.
You need to trust me. I'm the only one for you.
I give half of myself to you.
I remember you day and night.
My heart to you.
And your heart is on me.
Caught with each other.
My heart to you.
And your heart is on me.
Stick to each other as if in an arrow.
Look into my eyes, feel my heart.
He will tell you something that words cannot express.
Hold my hand, don't let go.
I want to hear that you will live for me.
When snow touches us with its cold. We warm up with a kiss.
When I'm in your arms We can't stop making mistakes.
Don't you want to be my darling forever?
Our eyes are opposite and opposite to each other.
My heart to you.
And your heart is on me.
Caught with each other.
My heart to you.
And your heart is on me.
Stick to each other as if in an arrow.
You have me to set me free.
Proceed. I feel like it keeps moving.
You don't know what I feel the way you do.
You decide. This game is getting more and more interesting.
- Hey dad. - Hi darling.
- How are you? - I'm okay now.
Still in pain?
- How do you feel? - Feel better.
Come on, sit down.
- Sit down. - Thank you.
They have been subjected to action.
They won't come back.
No one can hurt you anymore.
After all, it was an eventful day.
Yes, really bad.
I know.
Are you stressed? Why?
Dad didn't drink coffee this morning, did he?
How do you know?
Because depressed people often miss their morning coffee.
What happen?
Nothing, ma'am.
It's just an oil and natural gas project that we want to start in Spain.
..didn't get a NOC certificate.
The Spanish government is very firm.
If we don’t have it, investors will pull away.
The value of the stock will plummet.
If we get the NOC in a month.
Your father will be the richest entrepreneur in the UK in ...
..oil and natural gas as well as being listed in Forbes.
Because he faces northeast.
If he faces 42 degrees to the east ..
..it's likely that his wealth will be doubled.
I understand.
Father..
This arrangement of my father's office has caused negative things to happen.
But if it is arranged in a different way ..
Positive things will happen.
- I can't believe any of that. - Father..
Take this seriously.
If not in a few days dad will lose all the money.
JD, where is 42 degrees north?
JD, where is 42 degrees north?
Divya.
You're starting to believe this kind of nonsense.
Are you in love? - Dad?
Actually, yes.
The same guy.
- Who saved you? - Yes.
He's like a father.
Smart, handsome, smart.
Dad invited him to Dad's birthday party.
Dad, meet him. 10 minutes only.
Sorry baby. Dad was in Paris at the time.
- No. - I'm sorry, sir.
I just got an email. Prince Morroco is coming to London.
To meet you on your birthday.
Five minutes?
- Okay. It's only 5 minutes. - Thank you.
Thank you. Okay, I'll see you later.
- Bye. - Bye-bye
And dad, please don't change the position of this table.
Okay. Thank you.
- Hey! Change that table. - Sir. Miracle sir.
I got a confirmation call from the Spanish minister.
We got the NOC, sir.
Don't switch tables.
Dad, our case will be heard.
Today Krishna Murthy is going to court.
I will interrogate him.
I will meet Krishna Murthy for the first time.
We will definitely win this case.
I'll be back, dad
Where are you going?
To make my brother's deception a reality.
What?
I want to meet Krishna Murthy.
Hey! Abhi..
Hey, Sweety has stopped crying. Maybe he's right.
Irate Paki Cricket supporters injure Indian workers.
What's this boss? The boss has an important meeting with Krishna Murthy.
Is it important to do all this?
Nothing.
When I remember Krishna Murthy's deception against my father ..
Maybe I'll kill him if I see him.
That's why I want to let go of that emotion here.
Now, I'm calm.
- Let's go see Krishna Murthy. - Okay, boss.
There is a man who has deceived my father.
He made the father of a liar in front of everyone.
Abhi..
Hold on, you come by yourself.
Hey! Thanks for this painting.
Beautiful clothes.
You look charming.
Be careful when talking to dad. He's smarter than you.
Just a second.
Good luck for next year.
Forgive me.
Ayah. Abhi..
Forgive me, sir. - Yes.
Prince Morroco will arrive in another 10 minutes.
Dad, give me 5 minutes.
Beautiful.
Do you like butterflies?
You also like butterflies.
I really love my son.
I also really love your son.
You may be smart.
But that was before you entered this room.
Not after you came in. - Exactly.
I want you to think I'm a normal guy
Just kidding.
Gula?
2 cubes.
If you're smart enough ..
You won't waste 2 minutes of the 5 minutes I gave you.
If you're really smart.
You will not determine your child's life in just 5 minutes.
Mr. Krishna Murthy Kautilya.
Krishna Murthy Kautilya.
Remember that name.
We will discuss later.
Time to play.
And this game.
Will determine if you will be in my son's life or not.
I have never lost in this game.
And I never played a game that I would lose.
I will play to win.
I would play if I knew I would win.
Okey.
On these two balls.
One has gold, and the other has silver.
Select one.
If you choose the color gold ..
My child is yours.
This is my choice.
Give your telethon a second.
Do you know why you always do this game?
You divide everyone into 3 categories.
That doesn't make sense.
Clever people.
A very wise person.
Same like me.
First. Foolish people.
Because you pushed this ball forward.
He will choose the ball because he remembers it is a golden ball.
But the gold in this ball...
And he will lose.
Clever people.
Because you pushed this ball forward ..
You want him to know there's gold in this ball.
He will definitely pick this ball.
But the gold is in the ball.
And he will lose.
The last. A very wise person.
Because you pushed this ball forward.
Then he will remember there is gold. on another ball because you guessed ..
..he will pick this ball. And he thought ..
..he will take another ball.
Gold is in this ball.
He will still lose.
The moment you push this ball forward
You proved me. a very wise person.
But you know how I think.
I would think like a smarter person than me.
It means..
Wiser than a very wise person ..
My choice is this ball.
Gold.
It means..
I think that determines who I will exist in your son's life.
This is my logical explanation and I know you won't understand.
That's why I recorded it.
Watch when you're free.
Okay.
I excuse myself first.
Thank you for this coffee.
I ask you to remind me. Is he huh?
Krishna Murthy Kautilya.
There was only one man who called me by that name.
Ramesh Chandra Prasad or known as Subramanyam.
Your father.
How is she
I remember my enemies more than my friends.
After a few years you came for revenge, that means ..
..you have a strong motive.
In three meetings, you've trapped my son.
You must not have much time.
Probably ..
It was your father's last request.
Is he lying in bed?
How long will he live?
6 months?
3 months?
A month?
It must only be a month.
What did your father tell you?
Did he tell me he cheated or he was cheated?
As far as I know in this world there is no deception ..
Dealing with smart people is called fraud.
It's flying.
I'm just dealing with your dad.
You remember it was a scam and you wanted revenge.
I don't know what you're all thinking.
When someone succeeds they say he is a criminal.
I don't know about anyone else.
I'm not a criminal.
I'm just in business.
Indeed I cheated and I succeeded.
We should enjoy it too.
It is not easy to cheat.
You need different genes.
For example you.
You came to deceive my son.
But what happened was that you fell in love.
Butterflies 25 kror. Beautiful.
You gave a very expensive gift, that means ..
..you plan to deceive me and make my son bait.
This is my bank account balance.
35,000 kr.
Income for 30 years.
In 30 days.
You will make it empty.
- Dungu. - I'm sorry sir.
I just got the information. Prince Morroco has arrived.
Your time is up.
People are willing to wait a year to see me for 2 minutes.
But I gave you 5 minutes.
You go and tell me that you can meet Krishna Murthy for 5 minutes.
Berambus.
Guards.
- Get him out. - Wait for a while.
Sir, where is your birthday supposed to be celebrated?
From Paris.
Why did you celebrate it in London?
To meet Prince Morroco.
Aeed Milad Sheik.
Happy Birthday.
I speak in Moroccan.
I am the Prince of Morocco you have been waiting for.
So..
I didn't come because you wanted to see me.
I want to see you, that's why you're here.
And I still have 1 hour left.
Actually, I don't need to see you.
You know why I want to see you.
I want to see how you are before you die.
Otherwise it's hard to recognize you after that.
Your birthday present.
This is the November 1st newspaper.
"Krishna Murthy's empire is collapsing!"
"Krishna Murthy muflis."
This is the news of the next day.
"Krishna Murthy escaped."
Here's the news the next day "Krishna Murthy changed his identity."
Exactly in a month.
That means ..
Nov. 1, 6 p.m.
You will only have this 1 pound.
One more..
There are still 58 minutes left.
You probably won't have any more free time.
Make a plan to run away from me.
Sir. Do you want to take a break?
No.
35000 kr.
To your surprise, it might have added another 3 billion.
What do we want to do now?
Easy.
Hack his account.
Is the boss kidding?
To hack it, we need an account number.
..passwords, IBan codes BIC codes and more.
Kate.
Write down the details. - All right, boss.
Bank UDS.
Account number 234, no, no.
80081234
Spell Code - 235386
Kod IBan - CH37 RFXL 376349
Kod BIC - RJSPCH 2M
- Yes, great boss. - Great.
This is enough to hack his account.
Yes, boss. This is enough.
We can hack his account.
There is a small problem, to hack his account we need to have an account in the bank.
But to open an account there you need 2 kror.
And we don't have a pound.
You've invested all the money we have on the painting.
Wasting gave the painting to Krishna Murthy.
He has no taste.
He doesn't know the true beauty of the painting.
..can be seen if exposed to sunlight.
For him, it is enough to give him an imitation painting.
We don't need to waste money.
- JD. - Sir.
Hang the painting there.
Now is the time to rest.
Hello, sir. - Bill for Mr. Ramesh Chandra Prasad.
The report, sir. 10,000 pounds.
I'm sorry, sir. Your card has been declined.
What?
Can you try again? - Okay.
No. Can not. I am sorry. Your card has been declined.
How much did you put into the account?
I do not know.
Abang.
He bought a painting.
Did you buy a painting?
You bought 24 kror and bought a painting for Krishna Murthy's son.
Brother, don't be depressed. I'll take care of the money.
That's not your money alone. That's money from the three of us.
He used to trick us, and we lived on the streets.
Now we will live on the streets because we want to deceive him.
There is no difference. Now we have to start again by begging.
There's no point in telling you all this.
That's wrong dad. He can die peacefully, but he wants revenge.
He should have got a clearer picture.
Brother? - Yes!
- Brother will explain to him. - Brother ..
Brother, don't do that. Abang ..
I lied to my father.
I tricked dad about everything.
About filing a case against Krishna Murthy in court, it is all a hoax.
I told my father all that so that he would be happy.
He is not the Krishna Murthy that my father thought.
He's in power and we can't touch him.
This is reality, please try to understand.
Because my father wanted revenge, he bought a painting worth 24 kror for the girl.
We are doomed.
Dad raised us with difficulty.
But father destroyed us.
This is not right, father.
It doesn't matter if I've been to school riding a Ferrari.
The range rover I bought with my efforts was more important.
Dad, I also have a family.
I also have to take care of them.
Call my brother when my father is gone.
Abang will complete the last uparaca.
Because of the older son's brother.
Sorry dad.
How much have you replied to Krishna Murthy?
Satpal Singh told my father everything.
Dad heard you found him.
Tell me how long you should live.
Dad will try to keep breathing and living.
I did not want to die until I saw the fall of Krishna Murthy.
You go.
Abhi..
What about Divya?
Father's grudge is true..
That's why I found my love.
That's the main framework. Connect it.
Kate.. - Bos.
Do you accept? - Yes.
Infectious. Data launched. Access successful.
Accept. - Accept..
Kate, we only have 5 minutes.
- Otherwise the system will 'reboot'. - Reception is complete.
Reception complete.
Waiting for the password, Kate.
Hurry up, we don't have time. - Good boss. Is looking for.
Password accepted. A password is provided.
Trace it. - Tracking him.
Oops, I can't access the password.
Why Kate? Do something.
Access denied.
What is it, Kate?
I like your confidence.
So your plan is to hack my account and steal my money.
Proceed.
I like the confidence you have in me.
That's why you're depressed because I've come here
That's right.
Remember, we will discuss it later.
JD..
Don't stop them if they want to come to our office.
Let them try.
This is my access card.
With it you can enter any room, anytime in my office.
No need to bother to get into my office.
Let me show you something.
This is a connection device via satellite.
It can be connected to any server.
Each time you log into my account, it will create a new password.
And the password is only for 30 seconds.
Want to hack this device ..
Impossible.
I told you to remember something.
I came here feeling depressed.
I didn't come here because of you.
But for my daughter.
Each girl will go through 2 phases.
Before falling in love, and after falling in love.
Before falling in love, father was his hero.
After falling in love his father was a villain.
And me too ..
Not blessing your love.
But don't you think he needs to know why I disagree?
That's why I brought him along.
Divya .. - Want to play a game?
Next time, don't ask anyone to play this game.
You will understand if you play it yourself.
Select one.
If you choose the right, you will be a hero in your child's life.
Otherwise, you will be a criminal forever.
This is my choice.
Play it.
- Giri. - Sir.
Choose this.
Silver sir.
You lose.
I'm at the club. Bring two tshirts. Important.
One for you. And one for me.
- It's time for you to stop. - I want more.
That's enough Divya. - Thank you.
Boss, tshirt for the boss.
- You brought a tshirt for you. - I don't need it, boss.
Seriously, you have to stop.
Everything will be okay. Divya, please.
Forgive me.
To the edge.
Divya, I'm sorry.
I don't know if this is a way to apologize or not.
..because this emotion is so new to me.
Divya..
Divya, your father ..
True, I want to cheat on your father but I really love you.
Love and revenge are 2 different emotions.
..don't mix it like a cocktail
We will say we love if we love someone, as well as revenge.
I was unlucky because I had to do both at the same time. Do you understand?
Berambus.
Divya..
He told me to bring two, but I only brought one.
This is so bad, you know?
Divya..?
Divya, listen.
Okay, I'm sorry. I have the solution.
We forget what happened.
We start all over again.
Love me once again.
Divya, please.
Throw it away.
Throw.
Look here, Divya ..
Just flip.
Apologize to the bowl.
What?
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Can the bowl be repaired?
No.
This time I will win in this game.
Divya..
Divya please. Listen to me.
For the sake of the weary eastern horizon, will the sun never rise again?
For the sake of a lone star, won't the moon appear again?
For the sake of an unshakable beach, won't the waves storm again?
I ask that you love me..
Love me once again.
Love me once again.
Love me once again.
Love me one more time, baby.
Whether it's a dream or a cry.
Don't you see it again in your eyes?
Whether it's sadness or joy.
Don't you feel it again in your heart?
Look at me once more, smile at me once more.
You did the same thing over and over until now.
You're showing the same anger you once showed.
Like that, can't you love me one more time?
Love me once again.
Love me once again.
I apologize with all my heart.
I'm sorry just this once.
This error will not happen again. Love me for the second time.
I will come again. I'll see you again.
I will be introduced to you once again.
I will give my heart to you again.
Love me like it's your habit.
Love me once again.
Love me once again.
Love me once again.
Love me one more time, baby.
Love me once again.
Today the boss is an hour and a half late.
Sorry. - Excuse me, boss?
We only have 20 days left.
I can't stand the pressure, I feel like I just want to stop.
Divya could no longer be persuaded.
One ‘double shot’ cappuccino. I'm having a headache.
Lately, many bosses have been drinking 'double shot'.
It's all because of Divya.
That's right.
I can't forget him.
I'm used to him being there.
Yes ..
Now..
How will Krishna Murthy handle such a situation?
Will she feel guilty if her love fails.
He won't taste anything. He's stupid.
- He'll just put it aside. - So we do the same thing.
Hey, you tell me.
Tell me something to forget Divya.
Divya just wasted the boss, apart from the 'double shot' she didn't know anything.
No..
We should just save the love for Divya, don't bother right away.
Tell me something that will raise my anger at Krishna Murthy.
Why do you laugh when you get slapped?
I know boss, the emotion is not from here.
another from there.
I have news, boss.
If I told the boss, of course the boss would upset Krishna Murthy.
This emotion is not from here, but from there.
Krishna Murthy bought oil and natural gas wells in Spain.
It actually belongs to Kapil Sinha.
He said there were butterflies that were rarely found and bought the project at a cheap price.
If the project is started, he will be on the Forbes list.
So our target is no longer 35,000 crore but lakh crore.
If we can stop the project, Krishna Murthy will be destroyed.
Dad, what's all this?
It's okay, ma'am.
They think their air and water will be polluted if we dig for natural gas here.
Islanders objected to the project.
So, what will happen?
Nothing baby.
lanya under the law of the Department of the Environment of the Government of Spain.
In three or four days they will give dad a certificate of discharge.
We can keep working.
Taxi.
Welcome to Spain.
Divya, you?
Is this all your plan?
If you want to see our boss, you can just call him.
Why kidnap anyway?
We just landed, they kidnapped us.
You haven't just landed now ..
But 3 days before.
Did you hear what I said?
You came to Spain three days ago.
As soon as you arrive, you go to the Spanish state library.
Collect all the articles about dad's gas land.
..that is a 20 -year -old eco zone area.
From there you go to the Ministry of Environment and make a complaint.
You incited the people in the area.
..and make them protest this oil and natural gas project.
I know why you did all this.
In 2 days the Environment Committee will be here.
If the Committee does not issue a certificate of clearance, the project will be stalled.
So my dad will lose in this game.
He will lose all his possessions.
This is your plan, isn't it?
And this plan you call an operation ..
LEAD.
Lead (Lead)
L means Library
E means Minister of Environment.
A means excited.
And D, I still don't know.
I need to know.
Otherwise, you will continue to be here.
D means Divya.
I didn't come here because of your father, Divya.
I came for you.
Don't gossip.
LEAD.
How does Divya know our plans?
I have no doubt he's the boss.
He's a good guy, boss.
- Actually I think .. - You shut up.
We don't understand the language of the boss. He doesn't understand our language either.
Want me to talk, boss?
You want to say what we think, right?
Bunch.
The boss who told Divya, right boss? Because of love?
I want some juice, boss.
From now on, you all can't know anything about my plans.
- Sorry boss. - Go out!
What? What do you think?
You can't think of anything.
Finish it. Finish it right.
Now talk.
What does D mean?
What are you going to do to my father?
D means Divya.
Finished.
Are you done?
Nah.
Finish all this. Finish it.
- Okay. What does ISRO mean? - Indian Space Research Organization.
-NASA? - National Auronotic Space Administration
Who is the President of Britain?
Britain has no President. They have a Prime Minister.
Think before you ask questions.
Oh, so you're thinking in between the time intervals of my question?
No way.
Let me know.
D means what
D means Divya.
Ready.
I want to bathe.
Where is the bathroom?
What?
I have some questions.
Do you want me to answer from the bathroom?
No problem, you can answer while you take a shower.
Sachin Tendulkar.
What?
That's the answer to your next question.
How do you know I want to ask that question?
I know.
Anyone 2 feet away from me I would know their frequency.
What does that mean?
I know what they're thinking.
So talk.
The answer to my next question?
Belgium.
Talk now.
Answer the next question.
Britain.
Speak up. Answer the next question.
Frequency is not close enough. A little close.
Close again.
Close again.
Close again.
Amir Khan 

How can...
It's hard to believe.
I don't believe it myself.
You left a question paper in the bathroom.
- Divya. - What?
D means Divya.
What?
I have emotions left behind.
I want to take a shower now.
This is the right time.
Actually if you're too close to me ..
When I gave Amir Khan's answer ..
I feel like I want to kiss you.
You know me right?
Whatever the emotion, I will try to resolve it immediately.
If I don't make it and just keep that emotion in me..
I will probably do it on other people.
So if you give me that kiss again ..
I will go.
No way.
Why not possible?
What's the matter you can't kiss me?
After all, you don't love me.
No.
Will you feel emotional or romantic if I kiss you?
- Then let me know. - I don't feel that way.
So?
So there is no problem if I want to take my kiss again.
That's all. Are you ready?
Forget it.
You might get emotional if I kiss you.
Kiss Me. Kiss!
In fact..
I want to hug you before I kiss you.
Let me be filled with that emotion as well.
I will not taste anything ..
Did you see that?
You don't feel anything.
Because you don't love me.
Because this is my emotion.
Look, even now you don't feel anything.
But why is your breath heavy?
Are you mad at me?
Emotions?
How do we know if it's emotional or angry?
We'll find out if we test this hair.
Do you know one thing?
When girls start to get emotional. estrogen levels in the body increase.
If we test this...
We will know whether it is emotion or anger.
We test it in the lab.
Go take a shower.
I will wait.
Actually Divya, there is another emotion.
Hi good afternoon. - Good evening.
Good evening. - Hi..
In fact..
This is a hair sample and..
I want to check this girl's estrogen level.
Yes, I can, but I need his signature.
You need a signature here.
Thank you very much, Divya.
Because come to the lab with me.
If this test proves you have no feelings for me ..
I will never see you again.
- Here he is. - Thanks very much.
Why did you bring me here?
Abhi, do you remember this place?
This is not the third place you have visited in Spain.
This is fourth place.
Do you know what D is?
Dock.
Three days ago you came to the pier.
You met an animal smuggler.
So generally, as soon as the Spanish Committee arrives tomorrow.
You're going to drop it on the gas project.
Your plan is to stop the project.
What you don't know is ..
The committee will not come tomorrow.
They came today.
In fact, they have already left.
They have moved from the hotel.
They were on their way to the gas project site.
So this is my operation.
I didn’t even come to the lab to know about my feelings.
I just want to distract you.
I have no feelings for you.
Anyway ..
In half an hour the Committee will issue a certificate of discharge.
You only have 30 minutes.
Do what you can.
Abhi..
I really want to see you depressed.
Good luck.
Hello JD. - Yes, ma'am.
For safety, you better follow Abhi.
Hi all.
Glad to see you.
This NOC was signed by the Spanish Environment Committee
All Kay Gas Company affairs will be handled.
I am proud to appoint my daughter, Divyanka as CEO of Kay Gas Ltd.
Congratulations.
Oh JD. - Yes, ma'am.
Tie guarantees Abhi to come out.
Now he can't do anything to us.
But Abhi has been released.
Why?
It's not an endangered rat, it's just a normal rat.
lanya is always found in Spain, that's why
He was released because it was not a crime.
What kind?
Possible..
D does not mean pier.
Is she madam?
JD you follow me. - Okay ma'am.
Dr. Robinson. - Yes.
Can't check the girl's estrogen level with a hair sample.
What?
lanya gossip. Medically impossible.
I still haven't received the report. Can you give it to me?
Good.
This is a DNA report..
Yes.
The young man came one day for a DNA test.
With a sample of the blood sample that was brought.
And match it with your DNA sample.
Can you tell me whose blood sample it is?
Sir.
Hey, ayah.
Divya, why did you suddenly leave the party?
Dad, I want to go to jail.
Dad, Abhi distracts us.
He went to jail and he found someone.
He brought a blood sample to... - Divya.
You are the son of Krishna Murthy. Don't forget that.
You look down on his wisdom.
Dad, let me finish it.
Okay, come back quickly.
Okay, Bye-bye. Stop here.
JD, take this. - Good ma'am.

- Okay. - Thank you.

Hello, sir. They wouldn't let me in.
Rosa..
Is he not with you?
Why is this?
He wants to meet with a prisoner.
Want me to follow you? - All right, come on.
Okay, thank you.
What is your name?
What is your relationship with Abhi?
Why did he find you?
What do you two want to do to my father?
If anything happened to my father, I would not let anyone go.
I do not know.
He came to see me and asked me to hand him this envelope.
Come Divya, mother angel.
Father. - That's dad.
Thank you.
- Tandas. - Let me take him.
I'm sorry ma'am.
I want to check your bag.
Hello.
What are you doing?
I dont know anything.
Krishna?
Krishna?
Mother?
D for dreams.
Your dream.
You want to know how I know your dreams, right?
Because it's not a dream, it's a reality.
reality, forever it's like a dream chasing.
You once said, once it breaks it won't be restored.
But if what's broken is put back...
Only then do you know how beautiful it is.
This is for you.
Your estrogen levels are high.
Hi Baby, take it easy, because of you, take it easy.
In my heart, slowly, the cylinder began, bursting.
Oh my god, slow down, because of you, slow down.
On my body, slowly, Petrol marks are placed.
Your knife is like a smile that cuts all my sleep.
You threw away all my shyness.
I love you, I love you, this love attack is so exciting.
I love you, I love you, this love attack is so exciting.
If you become my main source of energy, the 'kissometer' inside me just explodes
If you become my main source of energy- the 'kissometer' inside me just exploded
If you hold me tight, the 'heartmeter' inside of me just explodes.
Your shadow gives me my shadow makes me go crazy.
Your speed becomes cyanide and drives the world crazy.
I love you, I love you, this love attack is so exciting.
I love you, I love you, this love attack is so exciting.
If you're away from me, we shiver like an ice bucket challenge.
If you and I get close, we'll fall apart like a jug of juicing.
Your love is like a plane crashing down on me.
Your words are like a kite that takes me high.
I love you, I love you, this love attack is so exciting.
I love you, I love you, this love attack is so exciting.
Please wait in the next room
Go out.
The war has begun.
In one round there are 100 people.
The first person has a sword.
The first person killed the second person.
He gave the third person the sword.
The third killed the fourth.
And give the sword to the fifth man.
That's how the murder went on.
Out of 100 people only one remained.
And that person is the one who...
73rd person.
0.2 seconds.
You answered in a short time that means ..
You are Ramesh Chandra Prasad!
I don't recognize you Subramaniam.
But I can't forget Kautilya.
Kautilya!
I haven't heard that sound in a long time.
I miss him.
If people haven't seen him for a long time, he will ask how are you.
But I don't need to ask you either.
When I look at you like this, I feel so sorry.
So there is nothing wrong if your child is hurt.
I feel sorry when I know your future.
It's a pity when your child isn't with you.
Yes you are right.
My daughter.
Remember that. We will discuss it later.
In this game, you are sure your son will win right?
If he succeeds in making you come see me ..
So to beat you, that's not a big deal for my son.
You have a strong desire to survive, right?
I live only to see the destruction of your life.
You should live because ..
You should see your whole family destroyed. Then you can die.
That's why I brought the best doctors from London.
You deserve to live to lose.
Didn't I tell you to remember something?
My child.
I have never lost.
That's why there's no need to kill other people.
But if the situation can make me lose ..
To win, I am willing to kill.
When your eldest son gets the news of your death ..
..he will rush to the hospital.
And my game began.
The butterfly effect.
Abhi, when did it happen?
What happen?
You gave a message saying dad was gone.
Me?
I didn't even message my brother.
- Are you drunk - No.
Today is the last day you have to defeat Krishna Murthy?
Still ego right?
Sweety's three -hour drive hasn't eaten yet.
I had an important meeting but I ran here.
Is this the right time?
Don't call my brother again. Never call.
If your father dies, don't call.
Brother listen to me .. - Enough!
We're done!
Listen to me brother ..
Forgive me. This is for you.
For me? - Yes.
Hello.
Remember the date again? 1 September.
You only have 2 hours left to beat me.
In the meantime, what say we play the game?
Before playing, I want to tell you the shocking news.
In Africa, there is an endangered species of scorpion named ..
Whatever it sounds like, the sting is very poisonous.
..and if you get hit you will die in 6 hours.
Actually I have two tails.
One is missing. Do you see?
You've already found it.
So you only have 30 minutes.
Don't worry, I won't kill anyone.
I will just win.
So I'll give you a clue.
Find and save yourself.
Do you have trouble breathing?
It seems that the poison is already effective. That's just the first rank.
The second stage, your knees will be weak.
The third stage, your vision will be blurred.
The fourth stage, remember this, we will discuss it later.
Is there a drug called VX06ZFM?
You won't get the antidote at the pharmacy.
Can you check it again?
He will deny it.
No. There is no such medicine.
That's my brother's car number.
Do you know who's after you?
The most dangerous medical drug mafia.
You know what's in your hand? Synthetic drugs.
It's worth millions of pounds.
The box will save you and they will kill you for the box.
does it look the same? There is only one antidote.
You are wiser than the wisest of them.
Find the right medicine, and save yourself.
Cepatlah Abhi..
Brother, do you use saline? - Yes.
My brother went near the saline bottle.
On the bag there is a number circled with a red pen.
Why is this?
Tell me that number.
105 000 2526
What number did he ask you?
3041
I told you to remember something, right?
Don't you remember?
He ranks fourth. Your brain stopped working.
Your IQ is 0.
Now you are a fool.
You leave the box open in the train and release the carbon dioxide.
You called your second brother to ask for a number.
Now the three of you are nearing death.
You should live for your father, Abhi ..
You should continue to live for your father, .Abhi ..
Lari Abhi, lari..
Give me the box.
Come on, let's go.
Abang ..
I'm sorry, you have food for my child, milk.
Thank you..
My child, hungry. Any bread?
1050002526
In this game if you win, you still lose.
You will be arrested for drug trafficking and imprisoned.
For 10 years.
Game over.
May I have your name?
Abhiram.
Date of birth?
May 28, 1989
And you have a lawyer to represent you today?
No.
I don't think I have a lawyer.
There, officer.
I am Vamsi. Advocate Abhi.
Good afternoon Sergeant. This is a bail document.
Can I have your ID?
Brother, wait a minute.
Where did you get the money for bail?
There is no money in the account.
Brother sells brother's car.
What is all this, brother ..?
That's my brother's favorite car.
It's just a Range rover.
When I was little, I went to school in a Ferrari.
It's not as important as Dad.
Let's go. Krishna Murthy doesn't have much time.
Just one more hour.
Sir, they're at the mall.
Where is he?
He went to the lord's salon.
Salon? What do they do?
They massage the head at the salon.
Head massage?
Are they crazy?
I can't tie it properly.
I'm there for my brother.
Sir, they bought new clothes.
Only 30 minutes left but are they shopping?
Do you follow them or do you follow other people?
Sir, I'm following them.
Why is your line busy?
Sir, they go to our office now.
Our office?
JD..
The boys have come to class. Do not disturb for 10 minutes.
Head massage, shopping ..
New suit.
- Looks cool. - Thank you sir.
You understand your physical condition very well.
Your defeat must be beautiful.
On the run you really need a new suit.
Your father also wore a suit while running away.
Nice. Follow the example of your father. Only 5 minutes left.
It's tomorrow's newspaper.
"Krishna Murthy's empire collapsed."
This is today's newspaper. "Krishna Murthy escaped."
It's the next day's news.
"Krishna Murthy changed his identity."
Take this and show it to your father.
Before dying, he should die happily.
Save this.
There must be some use.
I know you have no money.
Funerals should be made on a massive scale.
And enjoy a medical ‘manicure’ too.
And enjoy the 'medical manicure too.
Go out.
Sir, my brother wants to take a selfie with you.
Come on brother ..
Brother ... - Yes, brother.
Game begin.
- Brother. - Yes.
Beg. - Thank you.
Time for a game.
Now I want to tell you a scam.
If you believe it is deception then it will be deception.
What is he?
This is a kick check.
Because ...
Your bank balance is empty.
Check if necessary.
I am serious.
You are right.
Not 35.
It's 40.
And the difference is 5000 kror.
Three.
Two..
One..
Boom!
What happened to my account?
Wait a minute sir, let me check.
The lord who gave permission.
When do I give permission?
What are you doing?
Sorry to inform, your account balance is empty.
How?
It's easy sir.
You remember it was a hoax, and it came true.
This is a satellite device that generates passwords.
How can you hack it?
That's right sir.
It's hard to hack it.
But it's easy to type.
I do not understand.
Paintings bought with money from my brother's efforts ..
I installed a small camera.
So the moment you look at the password and type it ..
My assistant saw it and also typed in the password.
We succeeded.
His fingers are very fast.
That's why I chose him.
I can understand ..
Why do you doubt when all this happens?
Easy sir.
Our favorite theory.
The butterfly effect.
All this happens because of the position in this room.
If this table was there all this would not happen.
Father.
The position of the furniture in this room causes negative things to happen.
What if it is arranged differently.
JD where is 42 degrees northeast?
If the table is here, the sun will shine there.
Real beauty will be visible if it is exposed to sunlight.
Put the painting there.
Because the painting is placed there then our work becomes easier.
While you were eavesdropping on my conversation ..
I can see what you're doing.
Your device.
Great game.
You win.
But I didn't lose.
Natural oil and gas. Kay Group Company.
The largest coal area in Europe.
Each share is worth 1 lakh.
25,000 members.
Millions of lakhs ..
Unlimited amount of oil storage.
So is the value of the stock.
The money I lost, I can get it in a month.
Now go.
- Hello? Hello? - Speak up.
Sir.
I am Giri from Spain.
Sir, the gas at the mine has run out.
it doesn't burn.
Gas, what kind ..?
How can it run out?
Do you remember it's a gas tank that can be empty?
lanya lombong!
It's a gas tank. Very large barrel.
They put it 10km away, sir.
From there they installed a large pipe to connect it.
They make us believe that there is gas here.
We have been deceived sir.
Turn off the gas.
The owner from Kapil Sinha..
..is a friend of my father, Sathpal Singh.
Do you know who they are?
KMC Company Employees.
For people who fail like us..
I have set up a company.
Company name..
KMC
it means ..
Krishna Murthy Scam Company.
I will explain about this company for 2 minutes.
The same emotion in all of us ..
Krishna Murthy.
Everyone is here, including my father.
Has been deceived by Krishna Murthy.
Krishna Murthy is the reason our family is homeless.
My goal is to make him empty. That's my goal.
That is our company.
You remember this game started 30 days ago.
But I started the game against you 10 years ago.
My dad told and gave us everything we needed.
But I got to know what my dad wanted before that again.
What did you do?
Nothing baby ..
What he could not tell others, he wrote in his diary.
I'm sorry, Krishna Murthy.
I didn't do all this because I pissed you off.
I did all this because of my love for my father.
You have nothing now.
All the investors in your company already know your situation now.
You have been completely besieged.
You have no choice but to run away.
Abang ..
This is a special gift for you.
It must be very useful for you.
It's a surprise.
Game over.
There he is.
This is a special gift for you.
It must be very useful for you.
I am sorry. The situation is very critical.
We've tried.
Father..
Father..
Father..
It's over dad.
The work my father told me to do is done.
I threw Krishna Murthy to the side of the road, father.
She's fine.
I came to tell my father.
But why is dad like this?
Hey, don't cry. I'll kill you later.
I'm not dead, I'm still alive.
If someone cries, I kill him.
Hey! Wipe tears.
Father..
Dad, can you hear me?
Dad, can you hear me?
Dad said dad would breathe and breathe and dad would live.
20 years dad lived just for this, dad.
It's dad's fault.
What you did is wrong.
Father..
Listen to me, and please don't die.
At the very least, live a little longer.
Listen to what I'm saying, dad.
After that it's up to you, I won't stop you.
I've tried hard dad.
Dad, please.
Just a moment, listen to what I have to say, father ..
Dad, get up.
Wake up dad.
Dad, get up.
Wake up dad.
Dad for a moment. Bring a fast tv.
In an unbelievable event ..
Kay Gas claims ..
Gas mines in Spain are a scam.
The millionaire is finding it increasingly difficult to control the anger of the holder ..
..stocks, investors. K Group board members, members of the public.
Kay Group chairman Mr Krishna Murthy is currently being hunted by London police.
- Krishna Murthy .. - Hey you ..
Your name?
Subramaniam.
Let's go.
Every grief you face.
All obstacles are overcome.
Father..
My cradle ..
My beloved father.
My dear father..
My dear father..
My dear father..
My pray..
My life..
I remember I had to express my emotions at the same time.
But..
I don't want to express these sad emotions.
We have to hide some emotions in our lives.
So that I will never forget my father.
Meaning ..
This pain should be with me forever.
My beloved father..
I, Abhiram ..
