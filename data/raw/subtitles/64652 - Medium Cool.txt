Better call an ambulance.
- 5251, Chicago.
- 5251.
Better send an ambulance
out to the Eisenhower...
in front of
the MacKenzie turnoff.
Got a wreck. We got coverage.
We'll send it in with the bike man.
- Ten-four.
- Okay.
5251, clear.
Now, that's his public posture,
but he's the one who's right there...
with his eyes glued to the screen
when the blood starts running--
And he's the one who says,
"Ooh, isn't it horrible?.
Isn't it horrible?.
Let me see some more."
There are a lot of people
who buy The New York Times.
What I mean to say
is that it happens--
It has happened always,
whether it was a photographer...
or a journalist or a cameraman.
When you are in the middle
of something happening, you--
It is a risk
of the profession.
What's the difference between a person
who types something and a typewriter?.
The typewriter doesn't really care
about what's being typed.
But a typewriter's a machine,
and you're not a machine.
Actually, I'm kind of an elongation
of a tape recorder.
I've made films on all kinds
of social problems.
The big bombs were the ones
where we went into detail...
and showed
why something happened.
Nobody wants to take the time. They'd
rather see 30 seconds of somebody...
getting their skull cracked, turn off
the TV and say, "Let me have a beer."
But Hollywood, the news med--
Well, our position
is one to-- to record.
The dynamics that are
happening in society--
We don't deal
with the static things.
We deal with the violence.
We deal with--
Who wants to see somebody sitting,
to see somebody lying down...
somebody talking peace,
unless they're talking loud?.
The cameraman
makes the choice himself.
He's out
to get the blood and guts.
I believe that.
The other night on television...
there was a fellow in Gary--
in the ghetto.
If there's something else that maybe
is nice, that could fill the news...
he'll take the stabbing, even if
he's had 27 minutes of stabbing before.
They're someplace safe,
away from it. They deplore it...
but they deplore it
like all good people.
All good people deplore problems
at a distance, like Thomas Jefferson.
He loved the common man,
but at a distance.
This is exactly what happened.
Five cameramen have been killed,
one in Germany.
He was beat to death by a mob,
literally beat to death-- for UPI.
Know the excuse?. The crowd thought
he was taking pictures for the police.
They had a couple of fellas
in a civil rights protest...
that were chained together,
and I was taking pictures.
Cops said, "Don't you think
you'd better load the camera?'
I says, "I'm not out of film."
They said, "Load it anyway.
We wanna move these guys."
And he starts pushing the lens.
I says, "The next time you push me,
I'll fall down and start crying."
He walked away.
The 1 20 Angineaux lens,
and yanking back and forth...
yelling "Black Power" at me,
and I'm just shaking to death...
with a $1,200 lens on the camera.
I am in the middle.
I got no place to hide.
I'm carrying a 40-pound camera,
trying to get pictures of it.
The rioterwants to beat me up, thinks
I'm trying to identify him for police.
The policeman wants to elbow me
out of the way...
and I'm being gentle about it because
he doesn't want the sergeant to see...
he picked up some guy by his neck
and threw him in the backseat of a car.
Then the editor says,
"I want the pictures.
My audience doesn't care
what brought this on."
You have to feed your family.
You need the money.
Ifyou don't bring them back,
you're not going to have a job.
Forget that. I've got a job to do,
and I'm interested in it.
The point I resent very much is the fact
that wherever I go, I'm beat up.
Shoot into those troops!.
Shoot 'em!
Shoot the shit out of'em!
Get 'em!
You guys are shot!
What kind of country is this?.
What's wrong?.
We're people! Why do you
have soldiers here with bayonets?.
We got a captive. Hold on.
That was an unprovoked attack
that was retaliatory--
Not me. Not me.
This man has an obsolete weapon.
Make love, not war.
They stabbed one of our guys
in the belly.
I am Brigadier General
Richard T. Dunn...
commanding general of the
emergency operation headquarters...
of the Illinois Army
National Guard.
The emergency operation
headquarters...
is one which
was established last winter...
for the purpose ofplanning
and controlling operations...
in the event
of civil disturbances.
Over.
Out in the street,
their bayonets are fixed...
and they know it's for real
in a real riot in the city.
And here we know
it's more or less--
It's a war game, more or less.
How's it going so far?
I couldn't tellyou.
I'm the enemy.
We love you guys.
We have women foryou, beer.
Come on!
- Sing it, now.
- Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is marching on

- Now!
It is what our forefathers fought for--
the free choice ofpeople!
Y eah!
This country is changing.
It is no longer
for all the people.
- It is for some ofthe people.
- Y eah!
- We see a war we do not want.
- Y eah!
We see an apathy towards
love and brotherhood.
Y eah!
- Bring out the mayor.
- We want the mayor!
- Hold on.
- We want the mayor!
We want the mayor!
We'll bring thejudge
out to talk to you.
We want the mayor!
We don't want a flunky!
We want the mayor!
My friends,
I've stood before you many times.
Tell it to 'em, Mayor!
You elected me mayor ofthis town
for the last 20 years.
- No, we didn 't!
- Tell it to 'em!
We've given you everything
that we thought you needed.
I've let you use our swimming pool
every 4th ofJuly.
We want it every day ofthe year!
We've operated--
We've operated the liquor store
with a minimum ofprofit.
Sock it to 'em, baby!
Sock it to 'em.
I understand that
you have some problems.
- You have avoided our problems!
- I understand that you have--
I understand that
you have some complaints.
We shall overcome.
We shall overcome.
We shall overcome
Some day
Yeah
Get the guys with the cameras.
Four, three, two, one.

Richard starts back.
And cue announce.
And keep on coming.

Roll tape to record.

Fade in.
You want to move
over here, please?.
Let's go. Time is money.
Let's go.
Gus, is the El too loud for you?.
No, we can live with it.
Who here
is old enough to vote?.
I took my physical last week.
Physical to vote?.
- Why are you working for Kennedy?.
- He's the best.
- He's got long hair.
- He's against the war.
- What are you doing here?.
- She's my friend.
He's an idealist. He's for anyone
who hasn't got a chance.
- Who are you for?.
- I don't like him because of Oswald...
and Dallas and all that.
What does that have
to do with it?.
I think he should have
looked into it.
There's a lot of serious questions
that haven't been answered.
In the Saturday Evening Post
there was a statement...
that the CIA knew about
Lee Harvey Oswald's trip to Mexico...
only two months
before John Kennedy--
May I help you?
Damn it. It looks
like I'm a prime target.
First the hubcaps,
now my radio antenna.
Rotten kids.
What's the difference?. Channel Eight's
got more where these came from.
That's not the point.
What?.
- Where do you want to go?.
- How about a movie?.
Come on. Go after her!
Attagirl!
In the crotch! Atta baby!
In the crotch!
Kill her!

Kick her in the back!

You're just a chicken!
Go to work. Go to work.
Go! Go! Go!

That's right.
All right.
Deuces are wild, Robert.
Whoops.
All right.
Show him what to do.
Now, deuces are wild, Robert.
They count as anything
you want 'em to.
Hold 'em. Hold 'em.
Take this one.
Throw the rest away.

- Four?.
- How many you want?.

You mean four.

Two treys.

You throwed down
my three nines down, didn't you?.
No, he got 'em.
I didn't get 'em.
They're in the deck.
He threw 'em down.
Boy, it's hot.
You got anything to drink?.
Miss Horton,

- There's plenty ofwater in the sink.
- I don't want any water.
I want a Coke or something.
Let's go get a Coke, Robert.
We'll see you there.

- To get a Coke.
Get a Coke?.

Nobody.

You're pretty dirty.
You've been working them birds.
You'd better go wash up
before we eat supper.
Well, go on.
Go on, now. Get.
We thank Thee, Lord,
for this food.
Bless it to the nourishment
of our bodies. In Thy name we pray.
Amen.
"The racing pigeon,

Roll it up.
This may be the last time
May be the last time
but I don 't know
Well, it may be the last time
you march on the capitol
Well, it may be the last time
you march on Congress

Appalachia.
You see the si gn?.
- Could we get a drink of water first?.
- T o hell with the water.
Let's find this guy.
They're behind the Mexicans,
ain't they?.
I heard they were behind
the San Francisco contingent.
- This is in this direction here.
- I thought it was a blue tent.
I don't know how these people
listen to this crap.
I don't know how long
this is gonna keep going.
- Well, where is it?.
- Let's go this way.
I would hope, now that
the California primary is finished...
now that these primaries are over...
that we could now concentrate
on having a dialogue...
or a debate, I hope,
between the vice president and myself...
of what direction
we want to go in.
Mayor Yorty hasjust
sent me a message...
that we've been here
too long already.
- We love you, Bob.
- My thanks to all ofyou...
and now it's on to Chicago,
and let's win there.
We want Bobby!
Oh, no
I don 't believe it
You say that you think
you know the meaning oflove
You say love is all we need
You say with your love
You could change all ofthe fools
all ofthe hate
I thinkyou're probably
out to lunch
You guys here
to cover the funeral?.
Yeah, that's what we're here for.
I didn't hear you
come in last night.
You score?.
You left the TV set on.
You know, you can meet a lot of
interesting people in a cocktail lounge.
You know that for every man in D.C.,
there are four and a halfwomen?.
It's a beautiful city, huh?.
Wow. Beautiful.
Boy, this air-conditioning
really gets you.
Look at these guys.
Couple of hours,
they're all set up.
Twenty, twenty-five camera positions--
like nothing.
They've had experience
since we did J.F.K. in '63.
Hello, ladies.
What are your plans
for the summer--
this, which will be
a very political summer...
and possibly a very hot one.
Oh, well, now,
let's not get into politics.
Well, we always go up
to our place...
up in Ontario, up in Canada.
It's a place called Desbras.
That's D-E-S. It's French.
It's not like a girl's name.
And, well, about this time ofyear,
we always start looking forward...
to getting away from the city
and the crowds and the heat.
It's very primitive up there.
And I think sometimes
it's good for the soul...
to get away from civilization,
don't you think so?.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Is your mother home?.
- Yes. No.
- No?. Is she working?.
- Yes.
What time will she be home?.
- At 1 2:00.
- I see.
- Now, how long have you lived here?.
- I don't know.
- You don't know?.
- No.
Could you tell me where you lived
before you moved here?.
- Yes.
- Where?.
- West Virginia.
- I see.
Now, how many rooms do you have?.
- No-- yeah. Four.
- Four rooms.
- Do you have a TV set?.
- Yes.
- Do you have a stereo?.
- Yes.
And how many brothers
and sisters do you have?.
- None.
- You're the only child?.
- Yes.
- And how old are you?.
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen. Really?.
- And do you go to church?.
- Yes.
That's a good boy.
- Now, what is your father's name?.
- Buddy.
- What?.
- Buddy.
- Does he live here at home with you?.
- No.
Could you tell me
where I could find him?.
At Vietnam.
Let's go see
what damage we done up here.
- Look at the holes there.
- Golly!
Look around and see
ifyou can find another.
Hell, I got something here.
Come here.
I ain't gonna waste this, though.
Drink this.
Come on.
- You want to shoot it?.
- Uh-uh.
It ain't gonna hurt you.
Just put a shell in like that.
- It's safe. It won't hurt you at all.
- I don't want to shoot it.
Draw it back.
Knock it off of there.
That's all you got to do.
Come on. Let's go.
Come on.
Let's go look at pigeons.
Nothing's missing. I looked.
You out of shape, pal?.
What's in the basket?.
Dinner.
Why don'tyou admit it?
Go on.Just say it.
You're a bastard.
Admit it to me.
Admit it to yourself.
You're a rotten,
egotistical, selfish...
punchy cameraman.
Well?.
Well?. Well?.
Look at this here. Look.
How do you like it?.
Gus wired it up for me.
Look back there.
Fiber optics. Great, huh?.
See the TV?. Lights.
- Look at that.
- John.
Do you remember
when we saw Mondo Cane?
- We didn't see Mondo Cane.
- Well, I saw it.
I saw it, too, but I don't
remember seeing it with you.
Well, anyway,
that's not the point.
What's the point?.
Well, you remember that scene...
on an island,
where they tested an atom bomb?.
Yeah.
Well, there were
these big turtles...
you know, tortoises, who,
at a certain time in their lives...
would walk to the sea
to lay their eggs.
And they found that
the radiation thing...
threw the turtles'
sense of direction...
so instead of heading to the sea,
they went inland and died.
Oh, I'm crying.
Damn it!
Look, somebody
took those movies, right?.
I mean, do you think
did they or didn't they...
after they took those movies--
Do you think-- Did they reach down
and turn those turtles around...
or did they put them in a jeep
and drive them back?.
How the hell do I know what they did?.
Those were Italian cameramen.
I give up. I surrender.
No calories.
I'd rather
keep my kidneys for a while.
"Research physicians at the Istituto
del Salvador Muni in Rome...
reveal today the results of tests...
involving a new device to be worn
by expectant mothers...
during the entire course
of their pregnancy.
This device consists
of a steel and plastic cylinder...
which can be controlled
to create a partial vacuum...
around the mother's abdomen, reducing
atmospheric pressure on the fetus.
This pressure--
which is at sea level
1 4.7 pounds per square inch--
can be reduced by as much as 50%.
It was Dr. Giacobo Marciani...
director of
the hospital's research institute...
who first made public the results
of the test involving the new device.
Although it is anticipated
that the price...
in the early stages
of development, at least...
will be prohibited--

official comment
on the new device...
has not yet been forthcoming
from the Vatican."
Don't!
You're crazy!
No! Give me my sheet back! John!
Give me that!
I got you! You bastard!
Son of a bitch!
Let go of me, you fuck!
Help! No, not on the floor!
Jesus, you!
Help! Put me down! Help!
You bastard!
Let go of me, you prick!
Naughty, naughty.
I got neighbors.
- Son of a bitch!
- I got neighbors. Be quiet.
Catch you in the act.
They'll bust your arms. I like you.
Me too.
I'm gonna knock the shit
out ofyou.
Ouch!
There he goes.
One good deed a year.
I heard that.
- You dropped your newspaper.
- Who are you?.
"Horton.
4444 North Clifton."
I think this belongs
to your little brother.
I don't have a brother.
It belongs to my son.
Mr. Horton go for green beans?.
- Man.
- Not on the car.
Not on the car.
Come on. Get off the car.
Come on. Off the car.
Come on.
Get out of there.
Come on.
Come on. Out of the car.
This is an official car.
Come on.
- All those kids out there yours?.
- No. They belong to my neighbors.
- Are you from the mountains?.
- West Virginia.
- Just spent three weeks there.
- You did?.
We sure starve a lot
when the stamps run out.
Trouble is, you can't
get no "tobaccy" on stamps.
So you know about the stamps.
No, not really. I did this documentary.
Those words are on a tape.
Hello, Marian, this is Gus.
Page Katselas on number 51 2.
Have him report
to the wagon immediately.
Ten-four. Ten-four.
I could've let the bird go.
He would've flown back...
but I don't know how he would've
carried the basket.
It might've flown back
to West Virginia.
Harold spends all his time
trying to retrain him.
- How long you been up here?.
- Not too long.
- John, call the office.
- You got a telephone around here?.
In the hall.
Katselas here.
Yeah, but he's right outsi--
He did, huh?. Yeah, all right.
Anything else?.
All right. Thankyou.
You tell Harold the bad guy from
the parking lot brought his bird back.
- You tell him. Hear?.
- I will.
You mind turning this off?.
We're gonna make sound.
Would you shut this off?.
- Shut it off!
- All right.
Where was the money really located?.
Was it stuffed in the seat?.
It was in an envelope
on the floor.
What kind of envelope?.
What kind of an envelope was it?.
Ask him.
He's counting the money there.
He's counting the money.
How much money is it?.
- How much money is it?.
- Don't ask him.
I want to know from you.
How much money did you have?.
How much did you count?.
Did you count the money?.
- $1 0,000.
- You sure it was $1 0,000?.
It wasn't 9,000?. Wasn't 1 1,000?.
9,000?. $1 0,000, right?.
It was 9,000. I put 1,000 of mine
to make it 1 0,000.
What you gonna do?.
Get funny now?.
Gonna start putting me on?.
Let's not play games with each other.
I'm here to find out why you
turned in $1 0,000. Where did you get it?.
Aren't you thankful
I did turn in $1 0,000?.
Maybe not. I'm a policeman.
I'm just here to find out the facts.
Just tell her we coverthe news.
We do not manufacture violence.
Talk to her, okay?.
Mrs. Harris, I'm re-- Well?.
Remember the shot of the cabby
who turned the money in?.
- Forget it.
- There's a story there, Carlin.
A lot of people are interested.
I think it'll go on the Sunday reports.
No. I got a convention
coming up, a war...
I got baseball,
a nervous city...
plus I got chickenshit cameramen
that are afraid...
to go into the ghetto
without police protection.
No. Stay out
of those neighborhoods...
until I send you in there.
- I want film and lab.
- They got film.
- I want film and lab.
- Would you please stop bothering me?.
Mr. Evans's office on line six.
Write up a voucher.
Yes, sir. Good morning.
Hey, TV man.
Are we gonna be on TV?.
We wanna be on TV.
- TV, that's for us.
- Hey, TV man! What's happening?.
...slaughtered Philadelphia 9-0.
And finally, it was the Mets
walloping the Pirates.
- Locked?.
- Yeah.
-You know you're two blocks away?.
-I had some trouble in there last ni ght.
Thought we'd keep the equipment safe.
White bread on sandwiches
is not too cool.
- Come on, now.
- No. That's out of it. O-U-T. Out.
I don't think we have any other kind,
but I'll take a look-see.
Frank, I dug your name
in the paper.
You're somewhat of a celebrity now.
Want to fill me in?.
Well, I'm not
really a celebrity...
but, yeah, I found the bread,
and I turned it in.
- You turned it in.
- Uh-huh.
Were you acting as a Negro
or a black man?.
I'm concerned about this.
What do you mean, was I acting
as a Negro or black man?.
Ifyou were acting as a black man,
you would've kept the money.
Ifyou were acting as a Negro,
you turned it in.
You're my man.
You're my man and everything.
- How much money was that?.
- $1 0,000.
$1 0,000?. You kidding?.
Dig, now, look. You know--
Do you realize
how much ammunition and guns...
$1 0,000 would've bought?.
Well, I'm not quite there yet.
But I'm talking about,
you got to be alive to be honest.
- Whatyou doing around here, man?
- Just buying some cigarettes.
You ain't got no right coming here
to buy no cigarettes.
Guys like you get shot all up,
you know?.
-Yeah.
-Don't come here for cigarettes.
You know what I mean?.
We have a visitor.
- Frank Baker live here?.
- Frank Baker live here?.
- Frank Baker, cabdriver?.
- Frank Baker, cabdriver?.
- Does he live here?.
- Does he live here?.
- Yeah. Does he live here?.
- Does he live here?.
There's no Frank cabdriver here.
You don't know him?. He's a cabdriver.
I did a story on him. I'm a reporter.
- What's his name again?.
- Frank Baker.
- Frank Baker.
- Come on. You're putting the guy on.
This is the guy
who put me on television.
- How you doing?.
- Very well. I don't want to bust in.
I just wondered
ifyou got five minutes to talk.
- Let's do it over a drink.
- Good.
You know, Chicago cops...
are getting
funnier-looking every day.
- I'm not a cop. I'm a soundman.
- Bet you got credentials too.
The FBI supplies
the best credentials.
We know
that one of the best ways...
for spying on black people
is to impersonate TV men.
We're talking to Frank
about doing a story.
- Yeah?. What's that?.
- That's my Pageboy.
- Your Pageboy?.
- Yeah.
Hey, Richard,
come and dig this cat's Pageboy.
Now, what do you do
with "my Pageboy"?.
Well, I don't do anything.
It just hangs there.
If they want me to go someplace
or do something, they call me on it.
You mean,
they give you orders on this.
Yeah.
Man, you mean to tell me they talk
to you, and you can't talk back?.
He means he's a receiver
and not a sender.
Looks like they're
calling you now.
What, you a white flunky
or something?.
Wrong. You got a bad idea about--
I forgot something downstairs.
I'll meet you in the car.
All right.
Coming back.
He's coming back.
There he goes.
There he goes.
A honky flunky.
Look, man,
I've been on television...
I've been in the newspapers,
and it's made my life total confusion.
I find $1 0,000 in a cab.
I'm boob enough to turn it in...
and I get my butt kicked
by everybody in the world.
- No, man.
- That's just it, Frank.
It's a human interest story.
People identify.
- It'll be constructive.
- Are you coming, Frank?.
I'll give you a call, and
we'll have another talk about it.
Thankyou.
Excuse me, TV man, you wanted
someone for an interview, right?.
I haven't got time
right now, dear. I gotta run.
But I wanted to talk to you.
See, I'm a black actress.
- Listen, honey-- I haven't got time--
- Don't "honey" me.
I'm a black actress.
I demand respect. I'm not looking for--
- You call the station.
- No. You said you wanted somebody.
You want to hear-- know what's
going on, what black people are doing?.
- I'm not interested.
- Wait, wait.
- Don't "honey" me.
- You got to start respecting our women.
I have no disrespect in mind.
I gotta leave. I don't have time.
I want to talk to you
about what I'd like to do.
You people are always busy
putting your kind of people on.
I want to talk to you
about what I want.
- Listen, dear.
- I told you about that "dear."
- I'm trying to be very respectful.
- We demand--
- You demand what?.
- Demand respect.
- Handle it.
- I'll try.
- Don't call me "honey."
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
-This is the guy that came by the house.
-I know the guy.
So don't give him a bad time.
Leave him alone.
He's all right.
- Come on, baby.
- He's a jive--
Wait a minute.
I want to talk to you. Come in.
Let me askyou something.
Are you being friendly?.
Am I being friendly?.
I just saved your life.
- If I got to be afraid--
- You understand I just saved your life?.
If I got to be afraid foryour argument
to work, you got no argument.
I want you to understand
I saved your life.
You came down here to do some sort
of jive interview.
You did that. Came down here with
1 5 minutes of a black sensibility...
and so you don't understand that.
You came down here
to shoot 1 5 minutes...
ofwhat has taken 300 years
to develop.
- Grief, you know?.
- I'm not interested in grief--
All we're trying to explain to you
is that you don't understand.
I do something.
I do it well. That's my job.
You don't do it black enough. You can't,
because you're not black. We are.
When you come and say you've come
to do something of human interest...
it makes a person wonder whether
you're going to do something...
of interest to other humans, or whether
you consider the person human...
in whom you're interested.
You have
to understand that too.
You can't just walk in
out ofyour arrogance...
and expect things
to be like they are...
because when you walked in,
you brought La Salle Street with you...
City Hall and all
the mass communications media.
And you are the exploiters.
You're the ones who distort...
and ridicule and emasculate us,
and that ain't cool.
You don't want to know, man.
You don't know the people.
You don't show the people.
Here's some cat
who's down and out, you dig?.
He's nobody,
so he says to his old man...
"I'm nobody. I'm gonna die,
and ain't nobody
gonna know I lived," dig?.
So the cat finds a brick and
throws it through Charlie's window...
or he takes a gun
and he shoots.
Then the cat lives, man.
He really lives, dig?.
A hundred million people
see the cat on the tube.
They say,
"The former invisible man lives."
Everybody knows about his wife
and kids-- everything, you dig?.
'Cause the tube is life, man. Life.
You make him an Emmy, man.
You make him the TV star of the hour...
on the 6:00, the 1 0:00
and the 1 2:00 news.
'Cause what the cat is saying
is truth, man.
Why don't you find out
what really is?.
Why you always got to wait
till somebody gets killed?.
'Cause somebody is gonna get killed.
Is that thing loaded?.
As a matter of fact,
they call it a shotgun.
It looks about 1 2-gauge.
- Let's go over here.
- Okay.
There's a good background.
Very good.
- We can't shoot here.
- What do you mean?.
Too noisy.
Those gunshots will wipe us out.
It's always too noisy, isn't it?.
Let's go back over here.
- Good for you?.
- Yeah, fine.
- Pepsi machine. Good enough?.
- Fine.
Excuse me.
- What do I do now?.
- Just speak in a normal tone ofvoice.
Rolling here. Rolling.
Well, there's been
about a 46% increase...
in pistol registration
since last year's riot.
We're getting our business
from people...
who want to
protect their families and homes.
- Can you hold on a minute?.
- Excuse me.
- The damn thing's stuck.
- Point that down.
I've only got one head.
There we go. See?. This release.
There. Okay?.
- Thankyou.
- There you go.
- Not bad.
- You ready again?.
You want to start again?.
Well, I don't know
what you're looking for.
If a person
has a driver's license...
he has to know how to drive.
If a person gets a gun,
he has to know how to use it.
How he uses it or what he uses it for
is a personal right.
Sorry.
- Dick, let me have a dime.
- Sure, John.
There you go.
I asked him where he was.
He said, "I was on vacation."
Hey, loverboy.
Dede's looking foryou.
- Looking for me?.
- Johnny.
- There might be a little problem.
- What is it?.
Carlin came around yesterday
kind of mad.
Tell me something new.
Johnny, you know the outtakes
for that footage?.
- You know, the draft-card burners?.
- Yeah.
Did you give that
to the light show kids?.
For Christ's sakes, don't be cute.
What the hell did he say?.
He didn't say anything
definite really.
He just complained about you
being out when he needed you...
and screwing around,
shooting stupid interviews.
What the hell is up?.
Don't tell me what you think.
Just tell me what kind
of shit's flying around.
Jesus, let go.
I'll tell you.
Well, for about a year now...
the station's been letting
the cops and the FBI...
study our footage.
You're putting me on.
You're kidding me. What am I, a fink?.
How can I go out
and cover a story?.
It's a wonder more cameras
haven't been smashed.
I want to know why nobody told me
what the hell's been going on...
because you can bet
in the streets, they know.
You should've told me, Dede.
- Just a sec, will you?.
- Is he here?. Where is he?.
I want to see him.
He won't be in this morning.
This is foryou.
Where the hell is he?.
Why won't he be in?.
What the hell is this crap?.
I don't know what day
it plays. Wha--
That was a business call.
Accounting.
Did you get a severance notice
for John Katselas?.
Just a minute.
Yes, I have it here.
Who's calling?
I'd tell them to
stuff their lousy job in a minute.
Well, you know that. I would.
I would.
As far as I'm concerned,
I'm with you, John.
I'll tell the bastards,
"IfJohn goes, then I walkwith him."
Well, I gotta get moving.
Take it easy, Gus.
Remember me?.
Yeah.
Yeah, I almost didn't
recognize you in that outfit.
I work over there at Motorola.
Well...
it's been good seeing you.
How's the pigeon boy doing?.
Real good.Just fine.
- You always eat here?.
- It's pretty bad, isn't it?.
Most times I bring my own.
Where you headed?.
Did you finish your salad?.
You want some of mine?.
Sure?.
What's the matter?.
Maybe it's just that
he's not used to company, huh?.
What'd you do back home?.
I was a schoolteacher.
You were?.
Why aren't you teaching here?.
Things are very different up here.
Down home I taught five grades
in one room for one thing.
Wow.
Like the little red schoolhouse.
Kind of. But...
see, they don't recognize me
as a teacher up here.
The education that I had down home
isn't good enough for them...
for me to teach here, so I can't.
But I'll tell you,
I don't think I'd want to anyway.
I wouldn't want to teach
in the schools in this neighborhood.
- Why not?.
- They don't teach you nothing.
It's a Chicago school.
They got to teach you something.
They don't.
They run a television in there.
Well, they use TV these days.
They use educational--
Yeah, but not that kind ofTV.
You watch anything you want.
They don't try--
When you ask them to--
that you want to do some work...
they say,
"No, you do what I tell you."
- They let you watch TV, is that it?.
- Yeah, that's all.
- They don't do nothing else.
- Don't you like TV?.
Yeah, but--
You're probably doing
what you like.
- Where you from?.
- Right here. Chicago.
C.Y.O. welterweight boxer, 1 958.
You ever boxed?. Or do you
just wrestle when you fight?.
People down here use sticks,
rocks...
guns, and everything
down here in here.
- Nah, you don't use rocks, do you?.
- Yeah.
I don't. They do.
- Only dirty fighters use rocks.
- And guns and sticks.
You got a gun?.
Play gun?.
That's good.
I shot a gun when I was eight--
I mean, ten years old.
- Where?.
- West Virginia.
I'll take him with me
to C.Y.O. maybe...
and let him hit the bag.
Can I watch TV?.
Help me put the plates in the sink,
and then you can go watch TV.
I'll give you a hand here.
Is your bird okay?.
The other day, I thought you were
stealing something off my car.
I don't steal!
Anyway, what's so great
about your shitty car?.
I brought your bird back, didn't I?.
Anyway, it's not my car.
Beverly Hillbillies,
normally scheduled forthis time...
will not be seen tonight.
Instead, we bringyou the third part
ofa network special...
on John F. Kennedy,
Martin L uther King...
and Robert Kennedy.
Why'd they fire you?.
Can you get another job?.
Can you get welfare?.
I mean, unemployment?.
Do I look worried?.
Too many questions.
Why they canned me?.
I'm not sure I know the answer.
I started a story about a cabdriver
who found all that cash...
somebody lost and,
for unknown reasons, wouldn't claim.
Why?.
There's only one kind of money
a guy would be afraid to claim.
I had some idea maybe
there was a connection...
between guns, vigilante groups...
maybe getting ready
for a blowup this summer, you know?.
Then I got sort of sidetracked--
interested, so to speak.
But nobody said anything about this.
My director just told
my union local...
I had taken company film
without authorization.
You see,
it gets pretty complicated.
People rarely say
the real reasons for things.
Big corporations never do.
Just politics...
plain bureaucratic politics.
I guess it's the season up here.
Anyway, we only been
in Chicago a little while...
not even long enough
for me to vote.
Come on. Tell me how you managed to
teach five grades in one classroom.
I didn't manage.
One thing I did was--
Well, I just had three
in the third grade...
so I put one boy up to fourth...
and a boy and girl back to second.
That way I only had four grades.
Is that the new math?.
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows by the throne ofGod
Shall we gather at the river
Where bright Angel's feet have trod
With these Christians at the river
That flows by the throne of God
Yes, we shall gather at the river
The beautiful, beautiful river
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows by the throne of God
Yes, we shall gather at the river
The beautiful, beautiful river
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows by the throne of God
Well, I don 't know
what will happen now.
We've got some difficult
days ahead...
but it doesn 't really matter
with me now...
because I've been
to the mountaintop.
I don 't mind.
Like anybody,
I would like to live a long life.
L ongevity has its place...
but I'm not concerned
about that now.
Ijust want to do God's will.
And He's allowed me
to go up to the mountain.
- Jesus, I love to shoot film.
- And I've looked over...
and I've seen...
the promised land.
I may not get there with you...
but I want you to know tonight...
that we, as a people...
will get to the promised land.
Do you feel it?.
X rays, is that what it is?.
Does it grow hair?.
Is it vitamins?.
Can you feel violence?.
I don't know what to think.
It seems like no man's life
is worth anything anymore.
You see...
the media's got a script now...
by the numbers.
Flags at half-mast.
Trips canceled.
Ball games called off.
Schools closed.
Flags at half-mast.
Memorial meetings.
Memorial marches.
Moments of silence.
A widow cries,
and then she says brave words.
- More moments of silence...
- Standing by...
- in our Washington studio is...
- then the funeral procession.
a foremost expert on urban violence
on the contemporary scene.
A lot of experts...
saying how sick our society is,
how sick we all are.
The script is a national drain-off.
People say, "Yeah, yeah,
we're guilty. We're bad."
'Cause a lot of people are afraid.
They're afraid...
the Negroes are going to tear up
their stores, burn neighborhoods...
so they have this nationwide...
coast-to-coast network special
called "Mourn the Martyr."
Nobody's really
on the hook, you see?.
Traditionally, religion
has supplied the moral backstop.
When the script is finished
and Tuesday comes around...
or Saturday and...
National Drain-Off Week is over...
everybody goes pretty much
back to normal.
Normal this, normal that.
You know, normal.
We will be able
to speed up that day...
when all ofGod's children--
black men and white men...
Jews and gentiles...
Protestants and Catholics--
will be able to join hands...
and sing in the words
ofthe old Negro spiritual--
Free at last! Free at last!
Thank God Almighty,
we are free at last!
Goose bumps.
It reminds me
of church down home...
sitting there with Clovis...
and Grandma and Buddy.

In a moment, Contempt.
Here.
Don't want you to get wet.
I won't.
Come on, boy. Listen.
You know...
there's a lot of things that you
don't understand about womenfolks...
I want to talk to you about it,
ya hear?.
A man has got to be boss
of his home.
There ain't no two bosses in
the family because it ain't right.
- You understand that?.
- Yeah.
The thing I'm trying to show you is
that women don't understand a man.
Your home is your castle.
I don't care how bad
orwhere you live or what it is.
That's your castle, and that woman
was made foryou and belongs to you.
You don't belong to her,
but she belongs to you.
You twain become one flesh,
and that flesh is you.
She belongs to you, you understand?.
There's a lot of good womenfolks
in the world, don't get me wrong.
I mean, the majority of them,
they get high ideas...
Iike they want to go out
on their own.
They want to take over things.
- That's right. Yeah.
- Is that what you mean?.
But don't you never let them, son.
Come here.
- Wow! Somebody made this.
- You see it?.
Yeah, I made it. Look at this.
Wow!
That's a shower. You take
your clothes off over here...
then you jump in there.
What'd your daddy do
in West Virginia?.
Coal miner.
Why isn't he coal mining now?.
Coal mine shut down, I reckon.
We moved to Chicago.
He left,
and we ain't seen him since.
Just took off. I don't know.
We'll be good friends, okay?.
Bye.
Hey, champ. How you doing?.
You see, the object of this one...
is speed and power...
so...
you work on both.
You see...
really, the object is...
to knock the other guy's
brains out, and then you win.
Roll numberthree, numberthree.

National Democratic Convention,
August 1968.
Hey, how goes my boy,
Johnny the Greek?.
- All ri ght. Good.
- Good, good.
You look like you're doing
all right these days.
I saw you in the film
with Norman Mailer.
- What kind of a guy is he?.
- He's out of sight.
I mean, Mailer is wild.
He's crazy.
But the thing about Mailer is that
he cuts through the bullshit.
I mean, Mailer is a force.
He's a heavyweight.
Excuse me. May I make up
your room, please?.
Sure.
Listen, you don't have

And a gypsy on my own
I'll stay a week and get the grass
and take a bus back home
I'm reallyjust a phony
But forgive me 'cause I'm stoned
Every town must have a place

Psychedelic dungeons
Popping up on every street

San Francisco
How I love ya, how I love ya
How I love ya, how I love ya
Frisco
How I love ya, how I love ya

Psychedelic dungeons
Popping up on every street
Go to
San Francisco
First I'll buy some beads
And then perhaps a leather band
to go around my head
Some feathers and bells
And a book oflndian lore
I will ask the chamber of commerce
how to get to Haight Street
And smoke an awful lot ofdope
I will wander around barefoot
I will have a psychedelic gleam
in my eye at all times
I will love everyone
I will love the police
As they kick the shit out ofme
on the street
I can't. Harold's in there.
Please don't.
Don't. Please.
Harold, you up here?.
I asked his friends.
I told you...
I asked everybody
in the whole neighborhood.
I've been up all night long
looking for him.
Please, please, can't you send
somebody to help me find him?.
- You people--

Look, lady, we can't help.

I can't spare a man.
They usually come back, lady.

Is there any rule under which
Mayor Daley can be compelled...

A friend ofmine
from El Paso was with me.
Somebody threw something.
He said, "Didyou see that?
It was a cap or something. "
I said, "No. "
Some cop says, "What'dyou throw?
What are you doing here?"
He said, "I'm from El Paso, Texas. "
Then he pushed him into the crowd.
They're trying to
keep them contained...
so they can beat them up later.
- That's right.
- Then this girl passed through--
The policemen are grabbing
and beating everybody in sight.
A line ofpolicemen has cut off
the very front ofthe Hilton.
- There's mayhem in the streets.
- The victim was identified...
as former Channel 8 News
cameraman,John Katselas.
Katselas was taken
to Michael Reese Hospital...
where he's reported
to be in critical condition.
Cause ofthe accident
is under investigation.
A woman companion, not yet
identified, was dead on arrival.
People were being clubbed--
and I mean in Technicolor 3-D--
and they were crying and screaming.
I don 't know that
I've seen any bloodyet...
but I've seen
some liquid on the ground.
People were standing around crying.
What's your reaction to this girl
with the McCarthy pin?
I have no comment.
Girls, girls, boys, people of every
description are being grabbed...
and dragged into paddy wagons.
What didyou say?
And they're chasing people,
particularly people...
with anarchist flags
or anything like that.
You can see crowds
running in all directions...
and plenty ofthings
are being thrown.
Police have just grabbed somebody...
and are beating him over the head.
The whole crowd across the street
isyelling, "Sieg heil."
Another melee
is taking place in the park...
right in front ofthe nation.
Right in front ofthe entire nation,
this is happening.
NBC- TV is on the roof of
the Haymarket Cocktails/Restaurant--
part ofthe Statler Hilton--
seeing these people being dragged
into the police wagon.
The whole world is watching!
The whole world is watching!
I'm a successful businessman. I've
been saying, like everybody else...
"These kids are a bunch ofbums. "
Then I finally found out
when I got down here...
that, goddamn it,
the kids are right.
- What made you find out?
- I got gassed.
I came down here, and I got gassed.
Andyou kids, go, man, go!
The police just grabbed somebody...
and are beating him over the head...
and are trying to throw him...
into the paddy wagon.
A scoop, made ofpolice, simply...
flies out and-- flies out--
Move! Move!
I'm being made to move.
The cameraman, everybody's
being made to move now.
Move! Move! Everybody move!
We're being thrown up
against the wall.
Let's go!
Ijust got out ofbeing
smashed against the wall...
by the skin ofmy teeth...
by showing my press badge
to a kindly policeman.
People are being smashed up
against the wall...
and are being hit...
by the police with their clubs.
And those are real night sticks...
and people are really being hit.
