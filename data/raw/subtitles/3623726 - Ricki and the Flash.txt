I love you, Ricki!

- RICKI: Heh-heh-heh.
Thanks, everybody.
Thank you, my sweet Daniel.
- I adore you.
- RICKI: Aw.
Good evening, Tarzana!
[CROWD CHEERING]

- RICKI: That was Tom Petty.
"American Girl" from 197...
What was it, Greg?
- '77.
- Yeah.
'77. Wow.
And, you know,
I am proud to be an American girl...
born in the best country in the world.
[ALL CHEERING]
- I know you're proud too, Walt.
- Yes, ma'am.
Yes, sir. Too bad things aren't being run
very well these days.
[GUITAR PLAYS HARSH NOTE]
Anyway, I'm Ricki Rendazzo...
and I'd like to take this minute
to introduce my band, the Flash.
[CROWD CHEERING]
We've been the house band here
at The Salt Well since 2008.
Yeah, that was the year
we elected you-know-who.
No offense, Billy.
Ha-ha-ha. Whoa!
Yeah, we joke around.
Anyway, speaking of Billy...
he's the man on keys.
The great Billy Lambert.
[PLAYING LIVELY MELODY]
- And we got Buster Frye on bass.
- MAN 1: Buster.
- Mr. Joey Sweeney on the drums.
- MAN 2: Ow!
Newly single, ladies.
- WOMAN 1: Call me, Joe.
- RICKI: And finally...
[STRUMS NOTE]
my right hand man, Mr. Greg Sandoval...
- and his sweet Gibson SG.
- WOMAN 2: Yeah.
MAN 3: Whoo!
GREG: And, you know, uh...
I've been told it's not good
to date someone in the band...
but honestly, I don't think
it's hurting our sound, right?
- We're not really dating, Greg.
- GREG: Oh.
Excuse me, is that not
the correct terminology?
Are we hooking up
like my kid says, right?
MAN 4: Yes.
WOMAN 3: Yeah, yeah.
Well, we've been spending
some time together, yeah.
I spend time with Buster.
I think you and I are different.
Shit, I hope so. Shit.
Okay, I think this is a conversation
for backstage.
So let's just round it up, okay?
We learned a tune
since our last gig at The Salt Well.
Because some of you have asked
for more of today's hits.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- And we aim to please. Okay.
- MAN 5: Whoo!

- Oh. Thank you, darling.
- Yes, of course.
[SIGHS]
Hey, Danny, I'm sorry
I couldn't talk before the gig.
- Vocal rest.

Vocal rest? She thinks this
is Madison Square Garden. Ha-ha-ha.
- Hey, I...
- JOE: Great set, man.
- I take things seriously, that's all.
- I know. I love that about you.
[SIGHS]
I'm sorry that I, um...
Sorry about what I said onstage.
That was just some fun banter. Heh, heh.
You know, the crowd loves that drama
and tension. Yeah?
- Good one.
- Thanks, boy.
That was just, uh...
Anyway, that was what made
Fleetwood Mac really popular.
- Okay.

[CELL PHONE VIBRATING]
If she moved with me,
she wouldn't need that kind of thing.
It's probably my manager.

TROY: Good morning to you.
RICKI: Hey.
It's ringing up. Okay.
That's the way it goes. One.
- Okay, that's 447.74.
- Ouch.
I guess that's why they call it
"total paycheck."
Well, that actually is truly
my total paycheck. Heh, heh.
Four forty-seven, seventy-four.
That's about what I make in a week. Heh.
- How about that?
- Ooh.
And you'd like $150 cash back.
MAN: Yes, please.

There you go. There's your receipt.
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much, sir.

[SCANNER BEEPS]

You actually picked up.
I was expecting...
maybe you'd gotten, you know,
another new phone number.
I'm sorry. I don't have...
I can't figure out how to set up
the message box thing.
You know me. Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
What's the problem, Pete?
It's Julie. Max left her.
Where'd he go?
"Where'd he go?"
He left her. He's divorcing her.
He met someone new.
How is Julie?
Well, that's really why I'm calling you.
She's not well.
She's absolutely unhinged.
She's been here at the house now
for a few days.
She hasn't changed her clothes,
she hasn't showered.
Uh, she's a wreck. I'm worried.
Okay.
How is your wife handling all this?
Maureen is in Seattle
visiting her father.
- He is failing.
- Oh, right.
He has Alzheimer's.
No, it's ALS.
Yeah, that's short
for Alzheimer's, right?
No, it's not.
Okay, so how can I help?
Well, um...
you could be there for your daughter.

[MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON RADIO]
And you're here to see...?
The Brummels. Pete Brummel.
Can I see some ID?
- What?
- ID, ma'am.
[ZIPPER UNZIPS]
Here you go.
Thank you.
This says "Linda."
Yeah, that's my given name, but Pete
knows that I prefer to go by Ricki...
- so I'm sure he'll probably...
- Here you are.
Linda Brummel.
[DOG HOWLING AND BARKING IN DISTANCE]
Oh.
[WHISPERS] I don't have any money.
Let me.
Here. I'll get those.
RICKI [IN NORMAL VOICE]:
Hey, who is this?
Is this Ralphie?
No, that's Sigma.
Ralphie passed away a few years ago.
- Excess bloat.
- Aw.
Well, then we're new to each other, huh?
How was your flight?
It was fine, but travel has really changed
since we took the kids to Disney World.
That was 1988.
Yeah. No, I just mean, you know...
I remember when flying was a treat.
People got dressed up even.
Now I see these young girls in the airport
in their jammy bottoms.
Yeah. Well, I can see
you still put in the effort.
Thanks, Pete.
This is some place.
This is like a mansion.
Thanks.
Yeah, well, double-height entry...
and Maureen had to have Palladian
windows, so we put those in.
Very classical.
Yeah. I feel like Jefferson
at Monticello.
- I'll go tell Julie you're here.
- Heh, heh.
Okay. I'll just have a look around.
PETE: Okay. Julie?
Oh, my God.
Look at this place.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
[CHUCKLES]
Mm. My, my, my.
Wow.
Man.
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
Uh, Julie's pretty tired.
But she's glad you're here...
and looks forward to seeing you
in the morning.
JULIE: Wrong. No, no, no.
Julie is not looking forward to shit!
Hey, Ju-jee.
JULIE: Nice of you to grace us
with your presence.
Couldn't make the wedding, but here
you are right in time for the divorce.
Okay. Nobody wanted me at that wedding.
Do you have a gig or do you always
dress like a hooker from Night Court?
[CHUCKLES]
Going through a separation,
it can be a crazy time.
I'm not crazy, Dad.
I've actually never felt such clarity.
Well, there's actually a book
called Crazy Time.
- Oh, shut up, Pete!
- Honey, listen.
This whole thing is not a big deal.
- I read something in Parade magazine.
- No big deal?
A lot of women your age...
- having starter marriages and...
- JULIE: This was not a "starter" marriage.
I was gonna marry Max,
stay with him, have kids...
and actually raise them to adulthood.
Oh, okay. Julie, just take it easy.
Why are you defending her?
- She is your Max.
- PETE: What?
- JULIE: She walked out on you...
- Hey, no.
- ...just like Max walked out on me.
- But I was never unfaithful, Julie.
Ju-jee...
[FOOTSTEPS RECEDING]
[DOOR SLAMS]
[LOUD MUSIC THUMPING OVER SPEAKERS]
So, um...
- We'll try again in the morning.
- Yeah, of course.
I'll, uh, give you a ride to the hotel.
Oh...
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.
I... I'm so sorry.
[RICKI SIGHS]
I could hardly afford the plane ticket,
you know?
And, uh...
- Well, you know, I lost my car.
- Yeah.
- I'm filing for chapter 11.
- I know.
So I just thought since you and Maureen
built this big, new house...
- that it wouldn't be a problem.
- It's not a problem, space-wise.
It's, uh...
It's just...
I don't know, a boundary thing.
- But it's fine.
- Mm.
Hope Maureen doesn't mind.
No, Mo's very chill.
I'm the one that tends to get worked up
about certain things.
Maybe Julie gets that from you.
[SIGHS]
- The bathroom is en suite.
- Oh.
Okay.
So, um, welcome.
Sigma, come.
Come.
- I trained her myself.
- Heh-heh-heh.
Okay, well...
- Welcome.
- Okay.
Good night, Linda.
Good night, Pete.

Linda.
- Linda!
- Huh?
I was a real bitch last night, huh?
Well, it was late. Heh.
My therapist has me on Effexor,
and we need to titrate down a little bit...
because it's made me volatile,
anorgasmic.
You're having orgasms?
Anorgasmic. "An" means "not."
- It's Latin.
- Oh, I...
Yeah, I know. I knew that.
I just didn't hear you.
- What time is it?
- It's almost 10.
[PHONE CHIMING]
Blowing up here, Mom.
Who's Greg?
He's the lead guitarist in The Flash.
The Flash?
My band, The Flash.
I sent you the Facebook page
a long time ago, remember?
Give me the phone.
- He calls you "babe."
- Yeah, that's an L.A. thing.
Uh-huh. He also makes copious use
of the smiley face emoji.
As well as the cat
with the hearts for eyes.
- How long has Greg been getting it in?
- Hey, let's go to Krupke's.
[COUGHING]
I need a doughnut.
[CAR DOOR CLOSES]
Uh, I don't have any money.
You have a credit card?
Yeah, but it's linked to Max's account.
Oh, that's not a problem.

[RICKI CLEARS THROAT]
You know, it's hard to find a good cruller
in California. Heh, heh.
I guess you got to give up a lot
of special things to become a rock star.
Crullers were the least of it.
Yeah, Linda, that was the subtext.
Listen, honey, I came out here
because I wanted to help you.
I know you're in shock right now, right?
And I know you're probably feeling lost.
I tried to kill myself.
You... You...
Hm. Dad didn't mention that.
Oh. Really?
Three Fridays ago, Max told me that
he was in love with a girl named Nicole...
who works in traffic.
- Julie...
- I thought for a while about what to do...
and ultimately, I decided...
to take a bunch of sleeping pills.
I had them on hand
because I'm an insomniac.
Like me.
And millions of other Americans, yeah.
What are you doing?
I can't believe... I can't believe
you tried to kill yourself.
[VOICE BREAKING]
Julie, you... You're precious.
Listen, a lot of horrible things
have happened to me since you left.
- [IN NORMAL VOICE] Oh... Don't.
- This is just the incident you know about.
Excuse me.
- Could you guys take this outside?
- What, are you listening in?
That is so Midwestern.
Excuse me.
Hey, you can't raise kids
in a bubble, man.
I can enjoy my time with my kid
when it's my weekend.
Your weekend? Maybe you should've
tried to stick it out with her mother...
instead of leaving
the second that your boner wilted.
[CHUCKLING]
Let's go, Journey. Come on.
JULIE: Journey?
- Ugh.
- Aw.
That's sweet.
I like that name.
Oh, you would.
It's a great band.
MAN [ON TV]: He lays this one
right down the center of the fairway.
- JULIE: Unh!
- Oh.
You went to Krupke's. I was wondering
where you went. You bring one for me?
Nope.
She's eating.
[WHISPERING] Our child attempted
suicide and you didn't tell me?
I didn't... I didn't even find out
till the day after, okay?
And I was little more concerned with Julie
than Ricki.
- You should've called and told me.
- I did. That's why you're here.
I didn't realize that she was suicidal.
I thought she was just depressed
because of Max leaving.
Depressed? No, I could've managed that.
No, I'm...
Julie's always been a moody kid.
I wouldn't have even bothered
to call you.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Well, why not?
Because, Linda,
you don't really give a damn.
Yes, I do!
You shut me out of this family.
I shut you out?
- Yup.
- You came back here from California...
if you recall...
with a chip on your shoulder.
You were shut down.
- Well, I did come back.
- Well...
- You had moved on.
- I had to move on.
I wanted the kids to have a mother
who was there!
- It was my dream, man.
- And stupid me.
- I thought we were your dream.
- I can't have two dreams?
- No. In fact, Linda, you can't.
- Hey, you guys are fighting.
It's like the '80s all over again.
Too bad Adam and Josh aren't here
to relive the trauma.
- Oh, good grief. Oh.
- That's enough.
Speaking of, uh, Josh and Adam, um...
I let both the boys know
that you came into town.
Oh, g...
- Do they wanna see me?
- Josh does.
Adam doesn't.
In fact,
they're up for dinner this evening.
Josh is gonna bring his girlfriend, Emily.
They've gotten pretty close.
- Mm. Is Adam bringing anybody?
- PETE: I...
I don't think so.
Well, I'll have all my kids in one room.
- What a treat.
- PETE: Yeah.
It should be really enjoyable.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
GREG: Hey, here's Ricki.
Oh, tell her we love her.
I gotta be careful with the L word.
She's gun shy.
DANIEL: Oh, you'll get there.
- Hey, babe.
- So, uh, my daughter, Julie...
she apparently, uh...
She tried to kill herself
with sleeping pills.
Oh, man.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Whoa.
How is she?
Oh, no, no, she's okay. She's okay.
- But, uh...
- I don't know what to say.
I mean, you know my son, Derek,
freaked out on acid...
- but it was an accident.
- [VOICE BREAKING] I blame myself.
No way.
Blame that punk that cheated on her.
You got on the plane to Indiana
to be by her side. You're a great mom.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Oh...
I'm seeing my boys tonight.
Oh, that's great.
Enjoy it, okay?
I'm scared. I'm just...
- They're all grown up now.
- No.
No, you grow them, you know them.
They're the same kids whose diapers
you changed way back when.
[CHUCKLING]
Enjoy it.
- MABEL: Mr. Brummel, it's nice to see you.
- PETE: Hi, Mabel. Nice to see you.
- Thanks for squeezing us in.
- Anytime.
- Your party is waiting. Yup, follow me.
- Oh, okay.
Five minutes late.
[CHATTERING]
Yeah. So now we have to...
Here she comes.
Oh, boy.
Josh. Hey.
- Hi, Mom.
- RICKI: Aw.
Josh.
- JOSH: This is my girlfriend, Emily.
- Hi.
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you, Linda.
- Yeah.
- Hey, hey. That's Ricki Rendazzo.
You're in the presence of greatness.
Don't forget.
Heh. Adam.
You look so handsome, sweetie.
Oh, thanks, Mom.
PETE: Why don't you take that seat?
We can flank them.
- Good to see you. Sorry we're late.
- Yeah, you are.
Nice to see you're so punctual.
It's okay.
Can I get you some drinks?
Would you like another martini?
Yeah. Why not? Keep them coming.
- I'll just have water.
- Me too, water.
With Scotch.
So, um...
How is Maureen's father doing?
PETE: Oh, not well at all.
No, the disease is progressing
more rapidly than they'd anticipated.
So you've met Maureen?
EMILY: Yeah, of course.
Lots of times. Heh, heh.
Mo's great.
- Yeah.
- EMILY: Yeah, she's...
Emily and I have been together
for almost two years.
- She's met the whole family.
- PETE: Yup.
- Yeah.
- Em, why aren't you wearing your ring?
Your engagement ring.
You two are engaged?
Yes.
- JULIE: Yup.
- Yeah.
Josh got Emily
this conflict-free diamond.
He proposed at the lake.
We were all there.
It was beyond gay.
- It was lovely. It was lovely.
- RICKI: I'm happy for you.
So happy for you, honey.
- Thank you.
- Why didn't you tell me?
Well, we, uh, wanted to keep
things quiet for a while...
- so we could enjoy the news privately.
- RICKI: Oh.
But Julie said everybody
was at the proposal.
Did this just happen?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- JULIE: No. No, it was...
- No. It was July 4th.
- EMILY: Yeah.
JULIE: So that was months.
Months ago.
We all know you're going through
something, but you're cray-cray.
JOSH: We were planning on
telling you tonight in person.
Because I hadn't met you and...
Why don't you be honest and tell Mom
that you don't want her at the wedding?
WAITER: Would you be interested
in hearing our appetizer specials?
- Yes.
- No.
We're practically eloping, Mom.
Yeah, it's gonna be very small,
very green.
Not gonna be a big, formal wedding
like the one Julie had.
- Thanks for referencing that.
- Yeah, well, thanks for this.
I'm still having Ambien shits
from my suicide attempt.
- You wanna talk about my wedding?
- It's okay. Go ahead.
You know, it won't hurt my feelings
if you decide to elope.
Your dad and I eloped.
- It was great.
- Yes, it was.
Yeah. So, anyway,
this is wonderful, wonderful news.
- Thank you.
- RICKI: Wonderful.
Hey, Adam, when are you gonna
settle down and get married?
Who wants some appetizers?
- Mom, I'm gay, as you know.
- You used to love the carpaccio.
And unfortunately...
many of my fellow gay men
still can't get married.
Well, I didn't mean to a man
necessarily.
- Who would I marry, then?
- Well, I thought you were bisexual.
That was my cover story in college,
like, 10 years ago.
I'm really sorry that you didn't stay
updated on my sexuality...
but then again, you didn't stay updated
on much of anything. Am I right?
Okay. Okay. Now that I know that you
decided to say you're completely gay...
- "Decided"? You are such a homophobe.
- I won't ask about it again.
This is what she does. She costumes
herself as this edgy rocker...
who's cooler than the other PTA moms...
when in fact,
she voted for George W. Bush twice.
I support our troops.
And I'm the one
with the questionable lifestyle.
Huh? Meanwhile, she's running around
calling herself Ricki.
Well, that's a name, not a lifestyle.
I was born gay.
I was born Ricki.
[JULIE LAUGHS]
Touché.
This shit-show is making my day.
Is this whole thing a plea for attention
as per usual...
or are you actually a psychotic bitch?
Hey, don't you dare call your sister
psychotic!
[CHATTERING STOPS]
Oh, my God, she's parenting.
Someone get a camera.
Just cool it. This...
Let's... Look.
It's a very rare occasion
that we all get together like this.
Your mother's here, right?
I mean, I know...
I know we've always had...
some, you know,
issues and personality conflicts...
- but what family hasn't?
- Yeah.
PETE: But we are a family, still.
You know, let's... We can put
all that crap behind us, can't we?
And just appreciate the proximity.
I mean, at this moment,
the Brummel family and family-to-be...
is proximal.
That's special in itself, isn't it?
EMILY: Thank you.
I would get a bottle of champagne
for the whole table.
[JOSH & EMILY CHUCKLE]
- JOSH: No, but that's...
- But I just filed for bankruptcy.
WOMAN 1 [ON TV]:
Describe to me how it makes you...
WOMAN 2 & MAN [IN UNISON]: Well, doc...
And thank you for asking.
It's not that I feel unbreakable
or even impenetrable.
It's just...
WOMAN 1: What is it? Come on, Angelo.
This is a major breakthrough here.
[RICKI GASPS]
WOMAN [ON TV]: There is a wonderful,
old Italian joke about a poor man...
You're still here?
Hey.
[TV POWERS OFF]
What are we gonna do today?
I have therapy at noon...
so I gotta go wash my dick...
or I'll get another lecture
in personal care.
Why don't you skip therapy?
Just today.
Call in sick.
I am sick.
That's why I'm in therapy.
I mean, how often am I here? Heh.
Never?
[DANCE MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
JULIE: Honestly.
It's just a shampoo and trim.
You have really good hair.
You should, like, brush it.
She has my hair.
JULIE: Ow! Unh!
Not more than half an inch.
I can feel how much you're cutting.
RICKI:
Why are we so attached to our hair?
Someday you're gonna find a gray hair,
and I don't mean on your head.

about your steel wool, Mom.

You look very nice.
Well... How?
[RICKI SIGHS]
I just made a suggestion, you know?
- She listens to me.
- Huh.
I was a bit of a jerk yesterday.
I'm sorry about that.
The market had... The...
Things have been really stressful
at the company.
Yeah, well, you work very hard.
I admire that.
- You do?
- Yeah.
You used to call me
an uptight workaholic.
Yeah, honey.
- I used to call you a lot of things.
- Heh, heh.
But I changed, Pete.
I have.
I see that.
I mean, I've been trying to get her
to change her clothes for days.

and she's on some meds
and she's been going to therapy as well.
I don't like her to miss a session.
Oh. I don't think one's that big a deal.
I also understand
you gave her some marijuana.
No. Pete did.
It's Pete's marijuana.

Yeah, we did smoke some. It's a plant.
Okay.
I just think that maybe it's not great
for you to be here now.
You're always welcome in our home.
And I know Pete thought
it would do Julie some good to see you...
but I think what she needs right now
is normalcy.
Well, I got her out of those pajamas
and I got her hair done.
And I think she's doing a lot better
since I arrived.
Linda, hey, come on, please.
Please, don't be offended.
I'm just looking out for my kid.
Your kid?
Yeah, she's your kid too, of course.
But, Linda, come on.
Let's... Let's be real.
You haven't lived with her
since she was a little girl.
I was there
for the teen years and college.
She went to college in Milwaukee!
Yeah, and who do you think
drove her ass there?
Who do you think helped her
put together her dorm furniture?
Or paid her bail
when she got that DUI...
or went to the mother-daughter tea
at that God-awful white sorority, huh?
Who do you think's
been doing all the mom stuff?
Look, Linda, I respect you
as the woman who gave her life.
But after you went to L.A.,
Christmas visits didn't cut it.
There was a hole in this family
and I filled it.
No, no, no.
I tried to come out here to see them more,
but you always made it so difficult.
"Oh, this isn't a good time
because we're doing SAT prep."
Or, "Joshy has an away game."
Or... Yes, yes, you did.
You alienated my children from me,
Maureen. You poisoned the relationship!
Are you serious right now?
Yeah, I am. Yeah.
Really?
You know all those birthday and
Mother's Day gifts you got from the kids?
I paid for those.
I sent them. I'm the one who made sure
they didn't forget about you...
though they had reason to.
You should be kissing my feet right now.
Bullshit!
Well...
- I didn't want it to go like this.
- Well, that's how it's going.
Do you need help

- For free?
- Yes.
- I probably shouldn't.
- I think me and my small-batch whiskey...
are gonna go try and find
the little boy's room. You okay?
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Yeah?
OMA: Linda.
- Linda. Ha-ha-ha.
- RICKI: Oh, hi.
Oma.
- How are you?
- Oh.
Oh, I like you, you know?
Even though you ran off on my son.
- Oh. I always liked you too, Oma.
- Ha, ha. Between you and me...
I don't like Peter's new wife.
Peter and Maureen are happy.
Maybe now. It's only been a few weeks.
- No, it's been many, many years.
- Oh?
I've been looking for you.
Why don't we go find our seat, okay?
Jeff. Will you show Oma to her seat?
Thanks. Jeff will take you.
- RICKI: Take care.
- Hi, Oma.
Come on, let's go sit down.
- Hi.
- Uh, hi.
Hi.
I'm very busy right now, so I...
Yeah, sure. Big... Huge day for you.
But we'll, uh... Yeah.
[PLAYING SOFT TUNE]
MAUREEN: Oma, are you comfortable?
- Thanks. Thank you.
- JEFF [WHISPERING]: That's her.
That's Linda.
She's not even sitting with the family.
OFFICIANT:
So here we are, gathered here.
This big tree over us
and the roots beneath us.
I can't think of a better place to do this
than out here in Mother Nature.
And now we can open
the wedding ceremony.
[HARP PLAYING SOFT TUNE]
BODHI [SOFTLY]: Go ahead.
[MUSIC STOPS]
Oh. Don't. Don't. Don't run away.
Walk on.
[HARP CONTINUES PLAYING SOFT TUNE]
[SIGHS]
Mom. I'm so glad you're here.
I didn't know if you were gonna make it.
- Yeah. Greg pawned his Gibson SG.
- JOSH: Oh.
- Hi, Josh.
- JOSH: Hey.
- Wow. Heh.
- RICKI: Yeah.
Well, we got your RSVPs so late.
We couldn't really move things around
with the hall...
so, um, I hope you guys
don't mind sitting with Emily's cousins...
- and, like, our harpist. Heh, heh.
- Ha-ha-ha.
No, not at all.
We'd love to learn some harp licks.
[ALL LAUGHING]
Okay, bye.
Yeah, bye.
It really means a lot to me
that you came, Mom.
MAN: Hi, we're the Bremen Quintet.
Congratulations, Josh and Emily.
Bye.
[BAND PLAYING SOFT ROCK MUSIC]
- Congratulations.
- Hi.
So whatever table we're at,
that's the cool table...
- okay?
- Oh, yeah.
Ooh. There's Adam.
He's a sharp dresser.
- Come on, go say hi.
- Mm...
Come on.
RICKI: Adam.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey.
- Um, Desmond, this is my mother, Linda.
- DESMOND: A pleasure.
- RICKI: Hi.
- I see where Adam gets his cheekbones.
[RICKI & ADAM LAUGH]
We are seeing each other.
Oh, that's... That's wonderful.
Thanks.
Adam, I'm so glad you met someone.
Particularly someone so handsome.
- This is Greg, my boyfriend.
- Adam.
- Hello.
- GREG: Desmond, hey.
- Nice to meet you. Oh, groovy tie, Greg.
- GREG: Heh-heh-heh.
You're probably too young for this,
but have you heard of Bruce Lee?
Of course I've heard of Bruce Lee.
He's the man.
Yeah, you look just like him.
- Thanks.
- Not at all.
Not even a little.
You're not even Chinese.
Bruce Lee wasn't Chinese.
He was born in San Francisco.
- DESMOND: Mm-hm.
- RICKI: Huh. Oh.
Hope you have a nice time
and enjoy your vegan meal.
Ha-ha-ha. Thank you.
I'm a team member at Total Foods.
- Oh, I love Total Foods.
- RICKI: Ha-ha-ha.
All you boys do. Ha-ha-ha.
Okay, she has got to be
heavily medicated.
I like her.
[DRUMROLL]
WOMAN: Cut.
JOSH: Yeah!
[CROWD CHEERING]
Here we go.
CROWD: Aw.
[CROWD CHEERING]
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
[BAND PLAYING SOFT ROCK MUSIC]
And how did you meet the groom?
Oh. Caesarean section.
JOSH: Budapest, actually.
Yeah. It's gonna be, like,
I don't know...
- We need to... We need to go.
- Okay.
All right, folks.
[CHATTERING]
- Pete, it... It's time.
- PETE: Oh.
Your toast.
Hm. Well, um...
Good luck.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
Well...
[GLASS CLINKING]
All right, speech.
RICKI: Thanks.
Hello, everybody. Ahem.
Yeah. Hi.
I'm, uh...
I'm Rick... I'm, heh, Linda Brummel,
mother of the groom.
And I remember some of you
from years ago.
And it's nice to see...
Nice to see you again.
Um, yeah, at first I didn't know...
[MICROPHONE FEEDS BACK]
Whoo. Heh, heh.
What to give Josh and Emily,
you know, as a gift.
Not only because I don't have
any money, heh, heh, but...
But, ahem, also because there's so much
I haven't given them.
I was never a traditional mom, right?
Ha-ha-ha.
Um, so I won't be
a traditional mother-in-law.
I hope. Ha-ha-ha.
So I realized the only thing I have to give
Josh and Emily is the only thing I...
I have to give anyone.
I was never much of a housekeeper...
or a cook. Ha, ha. Right? Ha-ha-ha.
But I am a musician, you know?
That's all I am.
And that's what I have to give,
so I would like to give all I have to my...
My son and his beautiful wife...
[SIGHS]
right now.
Boys, you can come out.
[CROWD MURMURING]
Oh. I wanna thank
my children's other mother...
for everything.
- Oh, God.
- WOMAN: What happened?
[AMP FEEDING BACK]
It's okay.
Josh, who are they?
I think that's The Flash.
[GREG STRUMS GUITAR]
I usually have a way cooler guitar.
[DRUMS PLAY RIMSHOT]
This is a tune by Bruce Springsteen.
And this is for Josh and Emily.
JOE: One, two.
