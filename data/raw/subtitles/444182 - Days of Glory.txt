"NATIVES"
ALGERIA - 1943
We must rid France
of the German occupation
Come along! Come with me!
We must wash the French flag
with our blood!
Come with me, men!
We must liberate France
and sort out this situation!
Come, you men!
We must liberate France.
Saïd!
Come back!
Be reasonable.
Come back inside.
- Your grandfather never came back.
- Don't worry about me, Mother.
I want to help France.
I can't stay here.
I prefer the worst poverty
to losing you.
You have endured much worse.
Please, let me go.
It will be all right, Mother.
Pray for me.
Get in.
Move it!
Long live France!
Climb in.
MOROCCO - 1943
To the left...
Left!
I know that you Aït Tserouchen,
the mountain men.
are the French army's best fighters,
better than the other Berbers.
And you'll prove it!
Listen carefully now.
We permit raids in enemy territory
for food.
But hands off the women
or you'll be shot.
In France. No raids at all.
We show discipline!
It's our home, our motherland!
To the left...
Left!
Yassir, they make us march like mules.
Let's go back home.
Serve France with pride,
and France will be of service to you.
Why did you get us enlisted?
For the money...
so you can be married.
Forward...
March!
The Sergeant communicates
with his men...
SÉTIF, ALGERIA - 1943
through verbal orders...
and through signals...
through verbal orders
and through signals...
used simultaneously.
We're the men of Africa.
Come here from afar
We've come from the colonies
To save the fatherland
We've left behind
Our families and homes
And our hearts are full
Of invincible fervour
For we wish to bear high and proud
The cherished flag of sweet France
Should someone try to part us
We're here to die at her feet
Drums roll to mark our love
For our country and land
We've come from afar to die
We're the men of Africa
At ease!
Company...
Halt!
Left turn!
Don't salute me here.
They always pick officers as targets.
Corporal Abdelkader, 2nd Company,
7th Algerian Infantry Regiment,
reporting. Sir!
What can your lads do?
No idea. Sir. They're my first group.
You got your rank how?
I passed the exam. Sir.
I took mine with the Boche.
Corporal Leroux reporting, sir.
You can go.
Praise be to God.
Take this German rifle.
The best.
You'll be the marksman.
Take it.
Hit the deck!
Don't blame him, Sergeant.
They're still green.
I have the power
of life and death over you!
Starting with you.
Yes...
Sergeant.
The Germans are dug in up there.
At ease.
Tomorrow, our mission
is to climb up to the Boche.
to flush them out.
We have to do it.
It's a light infantry job.
You'll lead the men.
Any trouble, take out a cigarette.
Before you light it,
it'll be over.
Yes, Sergeant.
- It reassures the lads behind.
- Yes, Sergeant.
Hitting a soldier isn't allowed.
I know the Sergeant from Tunisia.
He's a good man.
He knows his job.
Where are you from Saïd?
From total poverty.
Listen, in that uniform...
you are just like me.
You're like all of us.
We're the same family.
The army means equality.
Wait a while.
You'll get your share of bullets tomorrow.
Corporal...
Are you afraid?
Enough talk.
Tomorrow, you'll know...
if you're soldiers or not.
Your coffee, Sarge.
Thank you, Ali.
Careful. it's hot.
We'll be in for it tomorrow.
Yes, tomorrow we have a party.
God willing.
O Merciful Compassionate
Lord of the Worlds,
Merciful. Compassionate King
of Judgement Day.
You alone we worship
and seek help from.
Guide us along the right path...
Merciful. Compassionate King
of Judgement Day.
You alone we worship,
it is You whom we beseech,
Guide us along the right path...
God is great.
I declare that no God but Allah...
...and Mohammed is his Prophet.
Move forward!
Abdelkader, move!
Abdelkader!
Corporal!
What do we do?
Shut up!
Move!
We'll die if we stay here.
Messaoud!
Ahmed!
Saïd!
Let's go!
Colonel, the artillery!
Battery number 5.
938-991
Battery number 5.
Position 938-991.
- Copy.
- 903-940.
Battery number 4.
Position 903-940.
Bearing 1400, order 340.
Charge 5. Loaded.
First gun, ready!
Second gun, ready!
Attention... Fire!
Stay down! That's our side.
Larbi? Larbi!
Don't be afraid, my little friend...
we're not going to die today.
Forward, Messaoud, over there!
Move forward! Keep going!
Sergeant!
Stay behind me!
Ali, are you hurt?
Keep going!
Come out of there!
Open his mouth.
Stop!
What are you doing?!
We're soldiers, not savages.
Fuck you!
Scum!
We're pulling out!
Long live France!
Colonel...
How many casualties?
How many dead?
It's a magnificent victory.
For the first time
since the 1940 defeat...
our army has defeated the Germans.
France has regained glory
and the Allies' trust.
Write that.
A photo Colonel?
Write what I said.
Let's go.
Lower...
That's it!
Yes?
At ease.
What do you want?
I come to say thank you.
You save my life, Sergeant.
You want to thank me?
Make some coffee.
You can replace Ali.
If I'm pleased,
I'll promote you to First Class.
Well? What did he say?
Are we going home?
- Soon, God willing.
- Is it true?
Thank you, my friend.
Where's my chocolate?
- Here.
- Thank you.
No tomatoes for you.
- Why?
- They're not for you. Move!
What do you mean?
Let go of him!
You're cooking while he fights.
Yes, Sergeant.
Move it.
Why aren't the tomatoes for everyone?
He's right.
We want tomatoes too!
He's right!
Shut your mouths!
You're not happy?
No one will have any now...
Sergeant.
They're ready to die for us
but any injustice will cause mutiny.
You know the natives, Martinez...
Avoid that term, sir.
- The Muslims...
- That's just as bad.
So what do I call them?
The men, sir. The men.
What's going on here?
Captain,
we fight alongside
our French brothers in arms.
On the same terrain,
against the same enemy.
We must share the tomatoes too.
German bullets
don't pick and choose, sir.
Sergeant. When we have tomatoes
let everyone have them.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
My boys... My dear boys!
The dream for which
so many have died
is coming true at last!
Your wounds and suffering,
all the pain
and bloodshed,
are the price to pay
to be on this journey
We shall soon see France again!
The motherland!
We are going home!
PROVENCE - AUGUST 1944
Smell it.
- It's not like at home.
- No.
French soil, is better.
Look!
Long live France!
Do you speak French?
Yes, I understand it.
- What's your name?
- Messaoud.
And what's your name?
Irène.
The sergeant says,
"Go up the mountain."
I was scared
but I go up the mountain.
I go up the mountain,
I run and run.
Messaoud to my right,
Abdelkader to my left.
I'm not scared then.
But Germany shoots at us.
Left, right, everywhere it shoots.
Messaoud says,
"Lie down in the hole."
I don't speak.
The sergeant looks at me.
I look at the sergeant.
I know what he wants.
I take the grenade, pull the pin
and throw it at Germany.
All of Germany, they die.
I free a country, it's my country.
Even if I never saw it before.
It's my country.
Your country is all you like?
God willing, we'll beat Germany.
Thank you very much.
Look.
Iron Cross. German.
Very beautiful.
Dangerous soldier...
Take this.
Good quality.
Iron Cross.
Unlucky
Why unlucky?
I didn't know you.
Sorry.
Good night.
Why are you scared?
The Germans won't be back.
You wiped them out.
It's not that.
But...
In my country,
we don't go with French women.
Leave it!
Don't touch it!
It's a sin!
I swear in God's name.
Aren't you ashamed?
Why. Yassir?
Is it God's?
- Don't touch it.
- All right.
Look...
Their God suffered a lot.
A lot
Tell me, Yassir...
When I was little,
the French soldiers
killed our whole family.
Did they massacre them?
What did they call it?
They called it...
Pacification.
Pacification?
- Corporal, can you read?
- Yes.
I can't read.
I never went to school.
You can learn.
Listen, Saïd...
Corporal, come here!
It's a military handbook, Sergeant
"The Infantry NCO's Handbook"
You want to be a Colonel?
A Sergeant first, Sergeant.
Let me read you a passage.
"In theory,
"no soldier should return home
illiterate from the army.
"Classes are obligatory for all men
"upon their enlistment."
Yet none of these African troops
can read or write.
Saïd...
You want to learn to read?
It's too late, Sergeant.
And to read what?
Get me a clean shirt.
You'll come back?
Yes, I promise I come back
You wait for me?
Yes.
RHONE VALLEY - OCTOBER 1944
I never loved a girl like this.
I want to marry her,
have kids and make a family.
You sure work fast.
Marseilles is paradise.
Here, Corporal,
they respect me. I'm not a wog.
I swear!
I make my life in France.
You'll always be a wog.
Shut it!
Ever slept in sheets before?
Saïd!
Saïd! Get in!
Get in.
Aïcha!
Me and Mother 1903
What is this shit?
Only you French guys get leave?
- We've fought since Marseilles.
- Us, Italy.
We're off to Paris.
You need to get back to Wogland.
This wog says fuck you.
You miss home, your family?
Why speak Arabic?
Me too. I like to go leave
to see my mother.
- Any mail for me?
- There's none for you.
Look again. It's not normal.
I wrote three times.
Messaoud Souni.
- Or maybe I'm listed as dead.
- I said no.
- Private!
- There's nothing for you.
Here's Aïcha!
How is she?
Has Sergeant Martinez
rejected you?
Marrying a Moroccan?
Why are you hassling me?
Go to your Marseilles girl...
A Yank is probably fucking her now.
It doesn't matter.
Want to know why?
You're the one I want,
Aïcha
Our beautiful Aïcha.
She takes care of us.
- As God is my witness...
- Saïd calm down!
If you ever call me Aïcha again...
If any of you...
No problem, my brother.
- Everyone has understood.
- Stop it!
Leave him be. Calm down..
If anyone calls me Aïcha.
I'll kill him.
Let go of him.
- I'm not a child!
- Let go of him.
Let go of him!
You're mad!
Are you soldiers,
idiots, or what?!
Shame on you!
Get out of here!
Get out now!
Quickly!
And don't do that again!
Listen to me, you.
You're not a slave.
There are no slaves here!
No one here has bothered with me.
Except the Sergeant!
Learn your book by heart
to become a Colonel!
Who's becoming a Colonel?
This donkey? This mule?!
Why can't they become Colonels?
Why not him? And even him?
Why not!
So try...
It's over!
Get to your bunks!
Do it!
I want no more trouble!
THE VOSGES - NOVEMBER 1944
Yes, it looks ugly!
It'll be worse in there!
It'll be tougher than Italy.
But I have faith in you.
I have faith in you
to liberate the motherland.
The French people have placed
their fate in our hands.
and are watching us
with eyes full of hope.
We have to be up there by dark!
And, even dead, we shall be!
Even dead!
Is it Omar, Sergeant?
Sergeant...
I've taken the position.
I'm here, Sergeant.
I'm the boss around here!
I ordered you to regroup,
not to head off on your own!
I give the orders.
I got you all this far!
We've lost Omar!
Go to say we've taken the enemy position
and request orders.
Yes, Sergeant.
Sergeant?
I have news for you Saïd.
You're promoted Private First Class.
You're transferred to HQ.
Take your pack and go there.
I don't want to be First Class, Sarge.
I'm fine like I am now.
I was kidding!
Learn to fend for yourself.
I might die one day.
You're not going to die, Sarge.
You not say that, ever.
You're going to be alive
to become Captain, God willing.
Captain is too much paperwork.
Are French girls all like this?
She says she's with you for life
and then forgets you.
Is that how it is here?
When you get promoted,
pick a rich, pretty one.
She is beautiful...
Look at the photo
and tell me what you think.
The truth.
Is she serious or not serious?
- What is her name?
- Irène.
Irène's a pretty name.
We have to see this war through.
We'll return with honour.
Irène will be proud of you.
Listen to this.
"After the war,
I return to Marseilles, Irène.
"I send you kisses. I think of you...
"...day and night, Messaoud."
- Pretty, huh?
- It's like a song.
CENSORED
They're not idiots, Captain.
They've been away from home 20 months,
they're freezing here...
I know, Sergeant!
- The French get leave.
- No ships!
There were ships to bring them here,
but none to send them on leave?
We'd like to see our families,
like the mainland French.
It's unfair.
And the French get promotion
before anyone from North Africa!
You're doing good work.
I'll put you up for promotion.
I don't want it.
My men deserve it as much as me.
Corporal Abdelkader, for instance.
Don't sleep.
Wake up! Get up!
God rest his soul.
What is it?
What does it say?
Read it.
"Muslim soldier,
"know that you can cross
to the German side
"where you will be warmly welcomed
"and your life saved.
"Your leaders send you to die
in place of the French.
"Muslim soldier,
"you weren't born into slavery.
"Germany will give you
your freedom.
"The day of independence
has come for Africa."
What would you do without us,
Abdelkader?
You have something in mind?
Out with it,
man to man.
De Gaulle said
we're fighting for liberty.
I'm fighting with France
against Nazism.
Come out of your holes!
We have leave!
Come out!
There is leave! We're going home!
It is finished. It is finished.
These aren't to go home in.
This evening, there will be dancers!
She hasn't replied to my letters.
Be patient, soldier.
There's a war on.
The mail hasn't arrived.
It has.
There was none for me.
Leroux! Martinez!
Martinez, you're promoted to
Staff Sergeant. Congratulations!
Thank you, Captain.
And you are Sergeant now, Leroux.
Congratulations.
Try to find stripes.
Well done, Leroux.
Thank you, Staff Sergeant.
Messaoud!
The girls will go wild for you
in those boots!
Do you like your coat, Corporal?
Yes, I suppose.
God keep you.
Amen.
Saïd!
He wears me out!
I have to go.
Here I am!
Sit yourself down.
Whisky.
Like in America.
Excuse me, Sarge, it burns!
Just a second...
Have a cigar.
- Is it for me?
- Of course it's for you.
You know,
I don't usually smoke cigars,
but I will now.
I like you, Saïd.
Me too, Sarge.
I like you too.
You deserve to be First Class.
The whole unit does.
But Staff can't see that.
They can't tell, they don't know us.
We'll liberate the country
and go home.
But, Sarge...
Here too is our home.
It's France.
We're fighting for her,
for the motherland.
Here is our home and I know
you're like us too...
An Arab.
What did you just say?
I see photo of your mother
in the shirt.
It's incredible.
Put the photo of your mother
next to photo of my mother,
they look like sisters.
You searched my things,
you bastard!
Shit-stirring scum!
Never talk about this again
or I'll kill you.
Get lost!
Fall in! Attention!
At ease!
What is this shit?!
Sit down!
I'm taking my leave!
With her potatoes
And mouldy beans
France is our mother
She feeds us
Listen!
Listen to me, my brothers!
When I enlisted,
I listened to De Gaulle.
He said France was fighting
for freedom around the world.
I thought the war would give us
the rights of our French brothers.
We're all fighting against Hitler.
for liberty,
equality and fraternity.
It's about time they gave us
some of that liberty,
that equality
and, above all, that fraternity!
We're changing
the destiny of France!
Things must change for us too!
Stand aside!
You're asking for it!
You keep stirring up shit!
The French reward themselves,
then you white Africans,
and we Natives are forgotten.
There are quotas.
Quotas?
Why didn't you tell us?
You can't understand,
so shut up and step down!
Why can't I understand?
A wog has less of a brain than you?
Wogs aren't capable of leadership.
That day will come, Sergeant.
Pardon me...
"Staff" Sergeant.
What are you doing here?
I tried to get to Marseilles.
The French get leave,
we get nothing. Is that normal?
Is it normal?
You tried to desert.
Are you crazy?
I have to see her.
Why are you here, Corporal?
I had a fight with Martinez,
the Staff Sergeant.
Got a Gauloise?
They're at the front.
Their position is secret.
Write to him.
I already have, several times.
There's been no reply.
Tell me...
Is he dead?
Give me his name. We'll find out.
Messaoud Souni.
He's with the 7th
Algerian Infantry.
If we hear anything,
we'll let you know.
Thank you.
Colonel, we must be firm
with the Muslims.
Punish this Corporal as a warning.
Rambert, tell me something...
Yes, Colonel?
Before joining De Gaulle
at the last minute,
what were you in Vichy?
- Martinez.
- Yes, sir.
You know the Muslims.
What do we do with him?
He's loyal to France, Colonel.
All my men are patriots.
Corporal, you risk
a court-martial!
- There is injustice, Colonel.
- Silence!
We must strive together
towards one goal: our victory.
France needs us, all of us.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Yes, Colonel.
In Alsace, the 35th US Division
has broken through.
They're under attack and require
reinforcements and ammunition.
We must hold this bridgehead
until the offensive
a few days from now.
Captain Durieux needs brave men,
men of experience.
It's a very dangerous mission.
I volunteer, Colonel.
Corporal,
I give you my word of honour,
that the rewards for yourself
and all the brave men
who contribute to
this historic exploit
will be worthy of the feat.
You will be the first
to reach Alsace.
All of France will watch
and remember you.
I shall fight with
my body and soul, Colonel,
as I have always done.
Corporal Abdelkader.
He's a man of his word.
There's no time to lose.
Get your unit's ammunition.
Captain...
Private Messaoud is in jail.
We need our marksman.
I'll see to it.
Thank you, Captain.
Tell the men to keep quiet.
Quiet!
We're nearing the German lines.
Keep quiet and control the mules.
Larbi?!
Why?
Why? My God? Why?!
The Captain and Leroux are dead.
We've lost five men too.
You're in charge now.
It is your decision.
Either you help the Americans
hold the line...
or you turn back.
Fetch the mule,
we're going on!
We've lost the ammunition!
- He's right.
- Silence!
We'll be the first French troops
in Alsace.
If we manage to hold...
the American positions, believe me...
we'll get what we deserve.
You'll get nothing!
Haven't you realised yet?
I've just given
my brother for France.
Enough!
Enough!
Corporal, be reasonable!
Be reasonable!
You want to kill each other?!
Enough have died already!
Corporal, pull yourself together!
Our comrades are dead!
Thanks to God, we are alive!
Corporal, God bless your family.
He's right.
- There's no point any more.
- What's wrong with you?
You want to be a Sergeant?
Too late!
You don't understand anything!
We're doing our duty
be going to Alsace!
Even if we pay 10 or
100 times this price.
We shall pay!
And they'll know us for it.
What's wrong with you?
Listen, Yassir...
You want to go home
with nothing?
We see it through to the end.
Your brother, God rest him,
won't have died for nothing.
Saïd, please go...
Bring back the mule.
Don't argue anymore.
It's over now. Go quickly.
Come here...
Come, my beautiful...
Come...
Don't make this difficult.
I'm tired...
Be good.
I can't run after you...
For the love of God!
Yassir, round the back!
The French!
You're alone?
Where are the others?
We'll defend the position, Staff Sergeant.
We'll hold it
until the Army arrives.
I would have done the same...
...Corporal.
I have to go see to the men.
I hope that you die.
Sergeant...
Staff Sergeant!
You'd never know
there was a war on..
What are we doing here?
After the war,
you will stay in the army,
You'll rise up the ranks and
become a Sergeant.
I don't want to be a Sergeant!
Some have the right to it,
others don't.
God forgets me for the moment.
Have you ever given
an order to anyone?
Never.
Tell me honestly
Will we survive this?
Listen, Saïd...
We've always survived...
together.
Did you forget that?
We are in God's hands.
Thank you, Madame.
Enjoy your meal, gentlemen.
Thank you, Madame.
Who can live in this cold?
The French!
Can I fetch milk
for the children?
Does she give a lot of milk?
Two or three buckets.
Want to try?
Sure...
You're never afraid?
Sometimes I am.
But tonight I'm not afraid.
Lord God...
I declare that there is
no God but Allah...
- I'll get Martinez.
- Wait, Saïd.
Listen to me...
Messaoud is dead.
Be careful, my brother.
Wait...
Yassir!
Cover us!
1, 2...
Go!
Sarge, get up!
Get up!
Come on!
Yassir!
Cover me, I'm coming!
Get out! Hurry!
Come on, let's go!
Move yourself!
Get up! Get up!
Get up for pity's sake!
Brothers...
I'm with you!
Don't shoot!
Okay.
Don't stop! Keep going!
Forward!
Colonel...
Colonel!
- Stop!
- Let me see the Colonel.
- What?
- Let me speak to him.
- See your Sergeant.
- He's dead. Captain too.
So where's your unit?
I don't have one.
They're all dead.
Sergeant!
You needed a Corporal?
Here's one.
Get your pack and follow us.
Look over here!
The French forces free Alsace.
This way!
Smile!
60 years later
In 1959, a law was passed to freeze
the pensions of soldiers
from former French colonies
about to become independent.
In 2002, after endless hearings,
the French government was
ordered by Europe
to pay the pensions in full.
But successive governments
have refused to pay.
