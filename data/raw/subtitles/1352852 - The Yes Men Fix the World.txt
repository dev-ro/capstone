[traffic rumbling]
- Are you ready?
- [inhales sharply]
[whimpers]
I'm extremely happy to be here,
because today is a very historic 
 occasion for all of us at Dow,
and I am grateful—
let's walk that way.
I am grateful.
- You're extremely pleased to be here.
- I'm extremely pleased to be here, yes.
Extremely pleased to be here, Steve.
- This is my friend Andy.
- Hi. 
- ^IBonjour, monsieur.^I
- And my name is Mike.
Today I'm holding the camera.
- Is it okay if?
- Yes, sure.
It's a good thing to announce.
- Exactly.
- Andy is about to go 
 on live television
in front of 300 million people.
They're going to think that he represents
one of the largest companies 
in the world,
which he doesn't.
And that's why he looks so nervous.
- Should I typically just look 
right into the camera?
Okay.
[sighs]
- Andy's about to tell a really big lie,
which, unfortunately, 
is going to wipe $2 billion
off one company's stock price.
- [sighs nervously]
- But before I tell you this story...
- One minute.
- I guess I should tell you how 
 we got ourselves into this situation.

[applause]
[laughter]
- Now what?
What we do is pass ourselves off
as representatives 
of big corporations we don't like.
We make fake websites,
then wait for people to accidentally 
invite us to conferences.
- My name is Fred. 
I'm from Halliburton.
My name is Hanniford Schmidt.
I'm with the World Trade Organization. 
I'm from Arizona.

Oborloo Hochmanks.
- Hundreds of oil and gas executives 
were duped today.
- Louisiana officials were taken 
for a ride by the Yes Men.
- ^ILes Yes Men.^I
- The Yes Men, 
anti-globalization activists
that travel the world pulling pranks 
at corporate events.
- A bunch of lefty protesters.
- World-renowned troublemakers.
- Sick, twisted, cruel.
- And what they do is really 
to take absurd ideas,
and they present these ideas 
in all seriousness.
[laughter]
- The group has done this 
many times before.
They have a track record 
of getting away with it.
So how did this happen?
Equity International says the imposters—
- At home in our underground headquarters,
it was time to start planning 
 our next mission.
- The battle raged on.
Tens of thousands of Iraqis have died.
- Worries are growing among top government 
 and business leaders
about the surge of food riots.
- Markets continue to shake.
Unemployment is up.
-The oil companies reported
the highest profits 
 in the history of the world.
- But with so many things going wrong, 
 who should we go after next?
We got our answer 
 when a text message arrived.
[glass shattering]
Dow Chemical had just bought 
 Union Carbide,
a company that became infamous 
 in the 1980s.
You remember the 1980s:
Challenger,
Chernobyl,
Bhopal.
Bhopal?
In 1984, when Union Carbide's 
 pesticide plant at Bhopal exploded,
at least 5,000 people died within weeks,
and 100,000 thousand more 
 remained sick for life.
It was the biggest industrial disaster 
 in history.
But Union Carbide settled 
 with the Indian government
for $470 million,
meaning most of the victims 
 got less than $1,000 each.
- Now, I just want to say to shareholders 
 of Union Carbide
that I am confident that the victims
can be fairly and equitably compensated  
 without a material adverse effect
on the financial condition 
 of Union Carbide Corporation.
- There was little adverse effect 
 on the shareholders,
but in Bhopal, 
 people continued to suffer.
When Dow announced 
 it would buy Union Carbide,
there was finally hope for justice.
Dow said it would compensate victims 
 of Carbide's past negligence
and promptly paid over $2 billion...
to 14 asbestos plaintiffs in Texas.
Dow could do for Bhopal 
 what they'd done for Texas.
But we knew they wouldn't.
So we decided to do it for them.
We set up a fake Dow Chemical website, 
 dowethics.com,
and we waited and waited...
and waited.
Then one day, we got our chance.
- You have mail.
- We'd just been invited to a conference 
 on international finance.
Some of the biggest banks 
 in the world would be there.
These were the kind of banks 
 who help companies
like Union Carbide and Dow 
 do what they do.
A company might say,
"We're gonna build a shoddy plant 
 in an underdeveloped country
"with a corrupt legal system.
"The plant might explode, 
 and people might die,
but we'll make a lot of money."
And the bank comes back 
 and says, "Great!
Sounds like a plan."
What could we possibly do 
 to show bankers
what was wrong with this logic?
So right now, I'm painting Gilda, 
 the Gilded Skeleton,
actually the golden skeleton 
 that we're going to use
in the Dow Chemical Lecture in London
at a financial services conference 
 in just a few short days.
The only good skeleton 
 is a gold skeleton.
In case Gilda didn't scare them enough, 
 we had a backup plan.
We rented a theatrical 
 pyrotechnics unit here
so that we can make 
 a big puff of smoke.
bang!
Oh, my God.
We're on our way to a conference,
and Erastus Hamm 
 is going to be speaking
at the conference 
 as Dow Chemical Company.
Our plan was to have Dow demonstrate 
 for the first time ever
exactly how they calculate 
 the cash value of human life.
Would this make the bankers think twice?
It was time to find out.
- Thank you very much.
On May 1st,
we are releasing the beta version 
 of Acceptable Risk,
the world's first market-smart 
 risk calculator,
to help you find out instantly
what risks are 
 or are not acceptable
from a bottom-line 
 business perspective.
Will Project X be just another 
 skeleton in the closet,
something your company 
 comes to regret?
Or will it be 
 a golden skeleton?
A complex case is IBM's sale
of technology 
 to World War II Germany
for use in identifying 
 certain populations.
This was very bad, of course.
But no one can deny they were profitable,
and although the issue remains 
 a skeleton in the closet,
in retrospect, 
 it is quite clearly golden.
You may have heard the joke.
How many Americans does it take
to screw in a lightbulb?
12, 1 to climb the ladder 
 and 11 to file the lawsuit.
[laughter]
What about Indians?
Oh, just one.
We would, of course,
never wish to imply that an Indian life 
 is worth more or less than another.
I myself believe 
 in the sanctity of all life.
But the market has its own logic,
and if we're willing to live with it,
we must make the most 
 of the choices it makes.
Because if there's one thing
that we at Dow 
 want you to remember today,
it's that the only good skeleton 
 is a gold skeleton.
[small explosion]
Ooh!
[applause]
Surprise.
[laughs]
This is Gilda.
She's the mascot 
 for the Dow Acceptable Risk program.
Gilda is here to basically tell you 
 that if you have a skeleton in the closet,
it may not be just a skeleton.
It could very well be 
 a golden skeleton as well.
And as you move into a future
of ever increasing complexity 
 and ever increasing opportunities,
Dow Acceptable Risk
can assure you that your touch 
 will be the Midas one.
- Achoo!
- And I'd like to finish 
 with a little poem.
I'd rather be handsome than homely.
I'd rather be youthful than old.
If I can't have a bushel of silver, 
 I'll do with a barrel of gold.
So thank you very much.
We hope you come up 
 and get a closer look.
[applause]
Thank you. 
 - Thanks a lot.
- Oh, thank you for having us.
- Thank you very much.
Here's a keychain.
Thank you very much. 
 Absolutely.
Unfortunately I don't have 
 a card anymore.
I've ran out of them, so—
- Oh, wonderful, yes, you were one 
 of the earlier speakers, thanks.
- Yes, so it's a pleasure. 
 - Thank you very much.
- It was definitely very interesting.
- Is it applicable— 
 is your model applicable to anything?
I mean, Is it applicable— 
 can we use it in risk management?
- Oh, absolutely. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I'll have our risk management 
 guys take a look at it,
because we do a lot 
 of interesting things.
- Wonderful. 
 Well, this is interesting.
- Thanks a lot. 
 - Thank you.
Okay, take care.
- Yes, hello. 
 - Hello, sorry.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- That's right.
- [laughs]
Yeah, yeah, well, yeah.
[laughter]
- Is that right?
- Well, that's pretty much— 
 yeah, that's exactly what I said.
I mean—it's— 
 did you find that not—
- Okay.
- Refreshing?
We'd meant to be shocking, 
 not refreshingly honest.
To us, 
 this was about as refreshing
as the Kool-Aid in Jonestown.
- The mass suicide and murder 
 of more than 900 Americans
took cyanide-laced fruit punch 
 from their spiritual father
and then lay down to die.
- That's the thing about cults.
What's shocking to outsiders 
 seems normal to insiders.
Is this why unfettered greed 
 seemed normal to bankers?
And if so, 
 who was the cult leader here?
This is Milton Friedman.
We were told that he was the world's 
 most influential economist.
- Did government play a role in this?
Very little.
Only by keeping the road clear 
 for human greed and self-interest
to promote the welfare 
 of the consumer.
- In this book, Friedman used 
 the word "freedom" 374 times.
But by "freedom," he didn't mean this.
He meant this:
the freedom of corporations to profit 
 no matter the risk to people
and without interference from government.
- Dr. Milton Friedman,
a scientist, a careful thinker, 
 and a great teacher...
- A hero of freedom, Milton Friedman.
- I sought out Dr. Friedman 
 and had the great pleasure and privilege
of meeting him 
 and his economist wife, Rose.
And we've all become friends, 
 and now I call him Milton.
- If we wanted to understand 
 the bankers' mind-set,
we needed to find the guru of greed.
There was only one problem.
[bell tolls]
But though Friedman 
 had now ascended,
his followers carried the flame.
- Okay, so we should go in there.
Oh, great. 
 Thank you.
- Uncle Milty, I call him.
- These guys belong 
 to free-market think tanks,
which have spent billions 
 of corporate dollars
trying to make us all believe
that if we just let corporations 
 do what they want,
everything will work out great.
- We're kind of on a quest.
We want to fix the world.
And we want to know how to do it.
- Private property, rule of law,
and a market unrestricted 
 by government regulation and control.
- When we see companies demonized, 
 we should work against that.
When we see 
 the free-market system castigated,
we must work against that.
- More wealth leads to greater efficiency
and greater innovation 
 and basically all good things.
- Wealth. 
 - Money.
- Privatization. 
 - Wealth.
- Money. 
 - Individualist freedom.
- Privatization. 
 - Free markets.
- Ownership. 
 - And a great deal of money.
- Capitalism and freedom.
- Wealth and prosperity.
- # Alleluia! #
- We were getting the message.
And so were millions of others.
These guys spread Friedman's 
 free-market gospel
by any means that they can,
like speaking to Congress,
viral videos,
and guest spots 
 on Sunday morning talk shows.
They claim to have derailed 
 the Kyoto Protocol
and to have helped destroy regulation  
 around housing,
banking, energy, 
 and the environment.
They agree to meet pretty much anyone 
 with a camera, even us.
- # Alleluia, alleluia! #
- You see there's 
 a blue screen behind you.
What would you like 
 to be put in front of?
- A planet Earth.
- Oh cool, a blue screen.
- I'd say the Jefferson monument.
- How about Jefferson Memorial?
That's—it's more— 
 - It's already taken.
- Oh, it is taken? 
 - Somebody asked for that already.
- I'm sure you have 
 a good backdrop of Washington.
- Don't put me in front 
 of anything in Washington.
- I hate Washington.
- Put up a scene in outer space 
 or something, you know.
- I would say a world 
 in which man is treated
as an end in himself rather than a tool
to be manipulated 
 by those with political power.
- How can we represent that?
Is there a single image
or a series of images?
- I think that the images are of men...
just the prosperity of free men
following what their hearts 
 and desires lead them to.
- I think we can find that. 
 - Okay, sounds good.
- Now that we had 
 our new friends at ease,
it was time to ask them 
 the really tough questions.
- What would you say to people 
 who harp on
the Bhopal catastrophe 
 or other tragedies?
- Bhopal is an interesting example.
But that facility had created 
 educational opportunities
for an Indian emerging 
 technocratic class.
It had created value-added 
 and tax base for the community,
and something like 3,000 people died.
That's a tragedy,
but there are always risks 
 of going into the future.
- "There are always risks 
 of going into the future"?
For thousands of people in Bhopal, 
 there was no future.
At least the Jonestown suicide cult 
 killed only themselves.
The free marketeers seemed willing 
 to put everyone else at risk.
Back at home...
- You have new mail.
- We had mail.
Turned out our Dow site 
 was the gift that kept on giving.
This time, 
 it wasn't a mere conference.
We'd hit the jackpot.
The BBC, perhaps the world's 
 most respected news organization,
was doing a big broadcast 
 about Bhopal,
and they wanted to know whether Dow 
 might finally clean up their mess.
The interview, they said, 
 would be broadcast to 300 million people.
This was what we'd been waiting for.
To the BBC's great surprise,
Dow emailed back to say 
 they would be delighted
to speak publicly 
 about the catastrophe.
As for us, 300 million people 
 was about a million times bigger
than any other audience we'd ever had.
We were scared.
So we asked the BBC if instead 
 of coming to their headquarters in London,
we could meet them in neutral territory,  
 the original land of revolution.
^I[La Marseillaise ^Iplays]
[cheers and applause]
- [laughing]
- Are you a little nervous?
- I'm so nervous!
Oh, God, it's like going to the guillotine.
I think it's right near
where they used to have the guillotine, 
 too, in Paris, the office.
Mm.
Yeah.
I think it's the biggest thing 
 we've ever done, this.
I haven't combed my hair 
 in, like, 20 years, yeah.
Really.
Like, I think I used to do it 
 this way.
All right!
We're off.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
When we acquired Union Carbide 
 three years ago,
we knew what we were getting,
and today we are prepared 
 to do the obvious.
Let's see.
Don't film too much 
 when we get there, I think.
Hi. 
 - ^IBonjour, monsieur.^I
- ^IBonjour.^I
- And you're watching ^IBBC World.^I
Our main headlines.
The world's worst industrial accident 
 is being remembered in India today.
It's 20 years since deadly gas
leaked from the Union Carbide 
 chemical plant in the city of Bhopal.
At least 18,000 deaths 
 are attributed to the leak,
and many local people say 
 that contamination
has never been properly cleared up.
- Yeah.
Should I typically just look 
 right into the camera?
Okay.
- The factory still exists here,
and that's been a real problem 
 for the people living here locally.
I mean, the site, I've been to it,
and it's full of toxic waste.
People who are living in these houses,  
 they've all got a story to tell...
- One minute.
- About that day 20 years ago.
Many of them lost members 
 of their family,
and they say that they're 
 continuing to suffer
because of the tragedy.
And they're saying somebody 
 needs to answer for this.
Legally what they're saying
is that they want 
 to pursue the company
to try and clean up the site.
But whether the company 
 will accept liability seems doubtful.
- Well, joining us live from Paris 
 now is Jude Finisterra.
He's a spokesman for Dow Chemicals, 
 which took over Union Carbide.
Good morning to you.
A day of commemoration in Bhopal.
Do you now accept
responsibility 
 for what happened?
- Steve, yes.
Today is a great day 
 for all of us at Dow
and I think for millions of people 
 around the world as well.
It's 20 years since the disaster.
And today I am very, very happy 
 to announce that for the first time,
Dow is accepting full responsibility 
 for the Bhopal catastrophe.
We have a $12 billion plan
to finally at long last 
 fully compensate the victims,
including the 120,000 
 who may need medical care
for their entire lives,
and to fully and swiftly remediate 
 the Bhopal plant site.
Now, when we acquired 
 Union Carbide three years ago,
we knew what we were getting.
And it's worth $12 billion, 
 $12 billion.
We have resolved to liquidate 
 Union Carbide,
this nightmare for the world 
 and this headache for Dow,
and use the $12 billion
to adequately compensate the victims.
- Jude, that's good news
that you have finally 
 accepted responsibility.
Some people would say too late.
It's three years, 
 almost four years on.
- When we acquired Union Carbide,
we did settle their liabilities 
 in the United States immediately.
And we are now, three years later, 
 prepared to do the same in India.
We should have done it three years ago.
We are doing it now.
And I would also like to say 
 that this is no small matter, Steve.
This is the first time in history
that a publicly owned company 
 of anything near the size of Dow
has performed an action
which is significantly against 
 its bottom line
simply because it's the right thing to do.
And our shareholders may take 
 a bit of a hit, Steve.
But I think that 
 if they're anything like me,
they will be ecstatic to be part 
 of such a historic occasion
of doing right 
 by those that we've wronged.
- Just to reiterate what Jude Finisterra,
the spokesman for Dow Chemicals, 
 has just said,
he says Dow Chemicals
now fully accept responsibility 
 for the events in Bhopal.
- Great.
- That's it? 
 - Well done.
- Great! 
 Now they wanted—
- Now you do...
together: Radio.
- I can tell you one thing.
We're not going out of business.
We will continue to make profit.
We will simply make 
 slightly less profit than normal.
But we are doing the right thing.
We're comparing here, though, 
 the value of money
to the value of human life, 
 and there is no comparison.
- Exactly.
I mean, how often 
 does Dow get to—you know?
I wouldn't want to be 
 a Dow spokesperson otherwise.
Good.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I'm going to have a serious 
 nervous breakdown now.
"Dow accepts responsibility for Bhopal,"
dash, dash, "Spokesman."
- Where is that?
- In Reuters.
"Congratulations, your appearance...
Everyone here at BBC cheered."
It's over an hour, 
 and it's still headline news.
Hello, this is Jude.
Who has said that?
Perhaps they're not in communication 
 with the Dow—
with the Dow leadership.
[phone ringing]
Hello?
Yes, this is Jude Finisterra.
Sure.
Right.
Sure.
Right.
Let me just—
yes, could I ask you to either— 
 to hold for a moment?
Okay, thank you.
Well, I wouldn't say it's a hoax.
It's an honest representation 
 of what Dow should be doing.
- This morning a false statement 
 was carried by BBC World
regarding responsibility 
 for the Bhopal tragedy.
The individual who made this statement 
 identified himself
as a Dow spokesperson 
 named Jude Finisterra.
Dow confirms that there was no basis 
 whatsoever for this report.
- Well, earlier today we carried 
 an interview
with someone purporting to be 
 from Dow Chemical,
a company which subsequently bought 
 the plant from Union Carbide.
This interview was inaccurate
and part of an elaborate deception.
- Take a look at this. 
 Like, look at this.
This is the top of Google News.
"Dow said on Friday 
 there was no basis whatsoever
"in the ^IBBC World Report^I
saying that it had accepted responsibility  
 for India's Bhopal disaster."
That's a funny sentence.
- The hoax was an elaborate one 
 involving a fake website.
- Dow Chemicals was quick to issue
a series of statements denying 
 all knowledge of a Jude Finisterra.
- Also, tonight, 
 backtracking because of this man.
- We're going back 
 to the BBC television studio right now
that we were at this morning, 
 because they want to talk to us.
We thought, "Well, okay.
What do they want to know?"
Well, let's go see.
- Yeah.
Hi.
Sorry.
[laughing]
- It didn't occur to us at all.
We got contacted by you guys.
- Yeah, I did hear that.
Has it gone back up?
- I'm sure it has.
- Well, the prank, 
 which briefly knocked
3% percent off Dow's shares 
 comes 20 years to the day
after the chemical leak 
 from the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal.
Today's unlikely corporate humiliation 
 of a U.S. chemical giant
was all about reminding 
 the world that Bhopal remains
an unhealed sore.
Well, earlier I spoke 
 to Andy Bichlbaum,
and I asked him what he did 
 when he got an email from the BBC
asking him for an interview.
- Essentially, Dow has been 
 promulgating a hoax
by which they've convinced people 
 that they can't do anything about Bhopal,
that they cannot accept responsibility.
And we wanted to prove 
 that that was not accurate.
- I mean, it is nevertheless 
 a pretty cruel trick to play
on the people of Bhopal.
- Well, we—
- Did you think about the people of Bhopal  
 when you decided to peddle this stunt?
- Yes, yes, we did, and—
- Well, that surely 
 is the tragedy of today.
You spring upon them the actual hoax 
 that they actually suddenly believe
that they have got 
 a payout from Dow,
and then, you know, 
 an hour or two later,
they find it's untrue.
- Let's put this in contrast.
I mean, we may have given people 
 two hours of false hope.
Dow has given them 
 20 years of suffering.
I mean, this is— 
 this is what we're faced with.
- Are you expecting the next knock 
 at the door to be Dow's lawyer?
- No idea what Dow will do.
- Dow's lawyers didn't call,
and millions of people learned 
 for the first time
that 20 years on, 
 Bhopal was never cleaned up.
But the media also reported
that many of the victims 
 in Bhopal cried tears of joy
upon hearing the news 
 and were then bitterly disappointed.
Had we actually upset the people 
 we'd meant to help?
There was only one way to find out.
Here we are.
We're in India.
Hey.
And this is Bhopal.
Bhopal is a big city.
There's over a million people here.
Unfortunately,
we heard from a lot of news reports 
 that the victims here in Bhopal
were extremely upset
because we had raised false hopes
about them actually getting 
 some compensation after 21 years.
What do you think they'll do?
- Well, I don't know.
I mean, what's the local custom here? 
 I mean—
[people shouting]
[shouting, gagging noises]
[excited chatter]
- We're here at the Sambhavna Clinic.
And this place was set up 
 by a bunch of people
to help treat the gas victims
of the worst industrial accident 
 in history.
- So patients come in from here.
This is a form basically
where we determine their history 
 of gas exposure
by how far they were living,
or were they sleeping 
 in a tent that night?
And then their severity grade 
 is determined.
These are some 
 of the disabled children.
And every system of the body 
 has been affected,
you know, the muscular, 
 skeleton, the nervous system.
40% of the women coming here 
 under 40 have menopause.
Yeah.
This is Sathyu.
- Hello.
Hey.
Oh, my God.
[laughter]
Hey.
We got the news that Dow 
 was willing to pay $12 billion.
And at first, we just felt the news 
 was too good to be true...
- Uh-huh.
- And Dow was too bad 
 for the news to be true.
- Yeah.
But still we thought, 
 "Maybe it is true.
Maybe they have just seen sense in this."
- Yeah.
- I mean, for about an hour 
 we were under that impression.
- Yeah. 
 Did people cry with joy?
- Yeah, I cried. 
 - Oh, no.
- Lots of people cried.
- Were you kind of angry at first, though,  
 when you heard it was a hoax?
- No, I wasn't angry.
- Wow.
Do you think it was worth it?
- Totally worth it. 
 - Okay.
- We are saying, 
 "No more Bhopals."
What people have gone through here,
no one else in the world 
 should go through this.
- I think we're in Shivajinagar.
And it's been a little bit of a— 
 a bit of a—
well, a bit of a—
[laughs]
a maze getting here.
What would you call it?
- We got lost.
That's what it's called.
We were trying to meet up 
 with a journalist to interview,
and we got lost.
Oh, here he is. 
 - Here he is.
- Oh, my God.
- Rajkumar Keswani 
 broke the disaster story.
In fact, he broke it years 
 before it actually happened.
So you had already predicted 
 how many times
that the disaster would happen 
 before it happened?
- When you heard it was a hoax, 
 the thing that we did,
were you, like— 
 what did you think of it at first?
- I thought it was a wonderful thing to do.
We were put into a situation
which we never thought of 
 that would actually happen.
So it is just like being in the heaven,
because I'm sure I'm not going 
 to be in the heaven.
So if one—
I'm expecting hell.
And suddenly, someone puts me 
 for a while in the heaven.
So I said, "Okay, thanks."
[laughter]
[kids chattering]
- Hi.
- 20 years since the disaster,
the poisons left behind at the plant 
 were still leaching into the groundwater.
- Communities that you see in red
have not gotten a single drop 
 of clean water.
- Oh, really? 
 - Yeah.
- Until now? 
 - Until now.
Eight communities are getting 
 about 12% of the requirement.
But this is contaminated water.
Some of them use to drink,
cook, wash clothes.
[kids chattering]
- Dow could clean up their mess, 
 but they didn't.
Instead, they spent 
 tens of millions of dollars
on an ad campaign 
 to clean up their image.
- For each of us, 
 there is a moment of discovery.
And just then, 
 in the flash of a synapse,
we learn that life is elemental.
And in the dazzling brilliance 
 of this knowledge,
we may overlook the element 
 not listed on the chart,
its importance so obvious, 
 its presence is simply understood.
The missing element 
 is the human element.
And when we add it to the equation, 
 the chemistry changes.
The human element 
 is the element of change.
The human element.
Nothing is more fundamental, 
 nothing more elemental.
- This is Kevin Finn.
He trades bonds.
- This is what I do.
sit here and just 
 look at this screen for, you know,
12 and 14 hours a day.
It's very romantic, actually.
- More than anyone else we knew,
we thought Kevin could explain why Dow 
 wouldn't do anything to fix Bhopal.
He told us what happened 
 when Andy went on the BBC.
- I got a call from my clerk 
 in the middle of the night.
Dow Chemical 
 made some announcement
that the stockholders 
 of Dow Chemical didn't like
because Dow's stock went down.
The S&P 500 futures went down.
You know, I had to go roll out of bed.
My clerk's, like, freaking out, 
 because my position's going against me.
My friend tells me 
 he thinks it's, you know,
some global conspiracy of traders 
 to try to screw us,
and, you know, 
 finds out it's two jokers.
- The effect of our big announcement 
 on the BBC
was that Dow's stock lost 
 over $2 billion in 23 minutes.
- This tells me all the news 
 that's happening in the world.
So on December 3rd,
if I was sitting here watching this, 
 it would say, you know,
"Dow Chemical decides to settle 
 with the Bhopal people."
And people that own Dow Chemical 
 would be like, "Ahh!
Sold!"
- Everybody we talked to about that 
 was really happy that Dow
was doing the right thing.
- Sure, sure, okay.
I mean, I'm not saying 
 that they shouldn't be.
I'm just saying that,
sure it seems like a good thing, 
 unless, I guess,
you're a Dow Chemical stockholder, 
 and you're expecting the $20 billion
to go towards a dividend 
 to come back to you
or to come to buy 
 some new chemical plant,
and it's going to these people 
 that, at least at this point,
aren't able to get any money.
I mean, you could see how that would— 
 how they could be upset about that, right?
- We were confused.
As kids, we learned that it was bad 
 to do something bad,
and if you did something good, 
 you got a reward.
Yet when we announced 
 Dow would do something great,
the market gave Dow a spanking.
So how could we get companies 
 to do the right thing?
We needed to change 
 the rules of the market.
But that meant regulation, 
 and regulation meant government.
The only problem was,
government was drinking 
 Friedman's free-market Kool-Aid.
- Free markets are working 
 miracle after miracle of economic growth.
- Open markets and rule-based trade 
 are the best engines we know of.
- But when the governments step back
and let the free enterprise system 
 do its work,
then the better we did, 
 the more robust our economy grew,
the better I did, 
 and the better my business grew.
- For the last 30 years, 
 the leaders of most powerful countries
did whatever 
 the free marketeers recommended.
And what they recommended was simple.
- The solution is not to have government 
 intervene or regulate in some way.
- In fact, most problems 
 will solve themselves if ignored
and let free people working 
 in free markets address them.
- Following advice like this,
governments around the world
got rid of a whole bunch of regulations 
 meant to protect people,
like in banking.
- I'm confident that the degree of harm 
 or spillover effect,
whatever subprime mortgages go bad, 
 that the market will devise ways
to minimize and diffuse 
 the negative effects.
- Their faith in the market 
 was unshakeable.
But we all know 
 what happened next.
- Now with the world's 
 largest insurance company, AIG,
on the brink of collapse,
it could mean devastation 
 way beyond Wall Street.
- What other disasters weren't coming?
- Global warming is silly.
It's not a serious issue.
Warmer is healthier, 
 and warmer is more pleasant,
and that's why states like Arizona 
 keep gaining population rapidly.
- Well, there are benefits 
 to global warming.
Cold-related deaths 
 will actually decrease considerably.
- Just like with the subprime mortgages,
our free-market friends 
 were doing all they could
to stop government 
 from intervening.
Except here, the stakes were higher.
- I think it's quite possible 
 that if it weren't for groups like ours,
that the United States might very well be 
 in the Kyoto Protocol by now.
- And if you've seen the ads 
 that we ran about a year ago,
which we produced in-house 
 on this global warming
where our central contention is,
"Carbon dioxide: 
 They call it pollution.
We call it life."
- There's something 
 in these pictures you can't see.
It's what we breathe out 
 and plants breathe in.
Carbon dioxide: 
 They call it pollution.
We call it life.
- We got lots of hate mail.
Two senators this past fall 
 sent a letter to ExxonMobil,
calling on it to stop funding CEI.
- So Exxon was secretly paying think tanks  
 to tell us we shouldn't regulate Exxon.
[glass shatters]
Public outrage forced Exxon to stop.
- In fact, ExxonMobil 
 didn't fund us at all this past year.
- That was great.
But Exxon had other ways 
 to influence policy,
like this guy, Lee Raymond.
He's a trustee of one of the key 
 free-market think tanks.
He also used to be Exxon's CEO.
And the year he left that job,
he became an official adviser 
 to the U.S. government on energy matters.
This was scary.
If we let the free-market cult 
 keep running the world,
there wouldn't be a world left to fix.
We had to do something.
So when we heard about a huge 
 oil conference up in Canada,
we decided to go.
Posing as a big PR agency,
we offered them Lee Raymond, 
 Exxon's ex-CEO, as keynote speaker.
They jumped at the chance.
But what they didn't know 
 is that on the day of the talk,
Raymond would be suddenly unavailable,
and an assistant would step in 
 to replace him.
- Okay. 
 - Yeah.
- "This keynote speech 
 will attract substantial media coverage
"and will be one 
 of the major highlights
of GO-EXPO."
- What would we do 
 to shake this audience up?
It would have to be more shocking 
 than anything we'd done before.
[building clarinet music]
- If there's one thing that's 
 gonna be abundant in the world to come,
what with climate change 
 and all that, it's people, dead people.
This is a pilot program to use that fuel.
It's called "Vivoleum," 
 and here we are making Vivoleum.
- As Lee Raymond's assistant, 
 Andy would announce Vivoleum,
Exxon's new biofuel to be made 
 from the victims of climate change.
And he'd even hand out a sample.
- So it started out, 
 we made one Reggie.
And then we cast 
 a bunch of Reggies in wax.
That's human hair right there.
- This is a lot of experimenting 
 to figure out
how to make a candle smell 
 like human flesh.
Ow!
I lost a Reggie.
- Quick. 
 - Ow!
- We wanted to make sure 
 that the oilmen knew
what the candles 
 they'd be holding were made of.
So we'd show them a tribute video 
 to Reggie Watts,
a terminally ill Exxon janitor 
 who had volunteered to be turned into fuel.
- I think I'd like to be a candle.
I think a candle would be fun, 
 because you can—
there's just so many uses for a candle.
- There are 6 billion people 
 on this Earth today.
We're probably using the energies, 
 maybe, of a billion of those at best.
- They had me test 
 a Hellfire missile once.
That was pretty cool.
- We simply haven't found 
 the miracle fuel yet
to replace petroleum,
but we'll eventually get there 
 if government gets out of the way.
- We had his miracle fuel.
And our grandfathers were turning over 
 in their mass graves.
[dramatic music]
- ^ICTV News ^Iwith Barb Higgins 
 and Darrel Janz.
- Good evening.
A bizarre situation today 
 at the GO-EXPO Energy Conference
at Stampede Park.
- Organizers and hundreds
of Alberta Oil and Gas executives 
 got duped.
- They'd been promised a major 
 announcement from a major player
in the energy industry.
Attendees paid 50 bucks a head 
 to hear this speech
from the National Petroleum Council,
a group that advises the White House 
 on oil and gas matters.
- Welcome to GO-EXPO's 
 keynote luncheon.
- Please welcome S.K. Wolf.
[applause]
- First, I need to say
how wonderful it is to see
on all the faces here today 
 the childlike exuberance
of a great industry in full flower.
And why not?
Without oil, at least 
 4 billion people would starve,
and starving would become 
 the new black.
But I'm not here today 
 to pat us all on the back.
I'm here to speak of Plan Bs.
- As Andy began outlining Exxon's 
 tough solution to climate change,
ten volunteers passed out 
 300 human flesh candles.
This vigil would be like no other.
- Who first had the idea to use 
 the oil of a recently living animal
to light his or her house?
Even today, Shetland islanders 
 cut the heads off their puffins
and put wicks in the stumps 
 to make candles.
We at Exxon firmly believe 
 that a free market will,
if left to its own devices,
always find solutions to the dilemmas 
 that humanity faces.
We're calling 
 our new technology Vivoleum.
- As Andy began to describe 
 Exxon's new biofuel,
the candles were lit.
A strange odor rose into the air.
- What you see here 
 is an artist's rendition
of an advanced, large-scale plant.
The Vivoleum feedstock 
 is renewable and unprecious
and responds to the need 
 of a shrinking market with greater supply.
The dance of capital appears 
 in full flower.
- Finally, it was time 
 to introduce Reggie Watts,
the dying Exxon janitor who had 
 volunteered to be turned into fuel.
- And now we begin the tribute video 
 to Reggie Watts.
- Worked in Maintenance for a while, 
 moved up to Maintenance II,
started doing cleanup, 
 toxic spill cleanup.
[bell tolls]
After I heard from the doctor 
 that I was going to die,
I felt like I had something to live for.
- I think I'd like to be a candle.
There's just so many uses for a candle.
I mean, you know,
like, if you want something romantic.
And that'd be nice to know 
 I was a candle on a table
you know, when people, 
 they first met each other on a date.
I think that would be great. 
 I'd love that.
That'd be a hoot.
- This is a funerary observance.
I mean, this guy died.
- Switch this off before I do. 
 - This man died!
- It's people.
It really is.
[people chattering]
- Thank you very much, gentlemen.
Thank you very much.
- I'm very sorry, 
 but we've been cut off.
Apparently, we're not allowed 
 to have a funerary observance
for a man who's died 
 to make a product possible.
And I'm being—
Are you allowed to do that to me?
[scattered applause]
- The remaining 20 is just, 
 you know, binders, bonders,
to keep it together.
We have to think—
- Excuse me, sir.
- Wow. 
 - Boy, oh, boy.
[indistinct chatter]
- Now. 
 Thank you.
- Hey. 
 - Shut it down.
- Don't touch my camera. 
 - Shut it down, now.
- Had we actually made 
 the oil people
think about what they were doing?
It was hard to tell.
And there wasn't much time left 
 to figure it out.
Big oil was already 
 destroying the planet
and not just by speeding up 
 climate change.
- This house right here, 
 it used to be on this side.
- No way.
- Yeah, it was over here,
but it moved over there.
You know, I could only take it, 
 like, two or three days a week
coming down here to work.
And this year for hunting season, 
 I mean, I didn't kill nothing.
I just wasn't in the mood to kill.
I mean, after seeing everything else 
 that was dead,
I just wasn't in the mood.
I mean, you know, 
 not that I'm a big killer,
but I like killing stuff.
- Yeah.
[laughter]
- It's really just amazing 
 when you go downriver.
Some of the ponds that we used to fish in  
 are now almost like a bay.
- For decades, the government 
 had ignored scientists' warnings
and let industry carve up the wetlands 
 that protected New Orleans from storms.
- About a million acres of land 
 has disappeared since 1930.
It was done canal by canal, 
 oil field by oil field,
port by port, 
 parcel by parcel.
It was, if you will, 
 death by a thousand cuts.
The governing mind-set, 
 culturally and legally, was,
if there's an impact, 
 we'll deal with it later.
And in some ways, you know, 
 this is a preview
of what the rest of this country 
 and the rest of the world
have in store for them.
[wind howling]
- When Katrina hit, the wetlands 
 weren't there to diminish its force,
and the levees didn't stand a chance.
So the real culprit for the destruction 
 of New Orleans wasn't just a big hurricane
but greed dressed up as progress.
- What produced this tremendous 
 improvement in technology?
It was self-interest 
 or, if your prefer, greed,
the greed of producers 
 who wanted to produce something
that they can make a dollar on.
- Greed had caused the biggest 
 catastrophe ever to hit the U.S.
And now the government 
 was handing out billions of dollars
in rebuilding contracts;
in other words, 
 letting greed solve the problem.
- There has been this idea
that it is government's responsibility 
 to replan the construction of New Orleans.
It's better to leave it to the market.
- We wanted to take a closer look
at how the market was fixing 
 the U.S. Gulf Coast.
- We're on our way to 
 the Gulf Coast Reconstruction Conference
at the Washington Convention Center.
We're going to talk to a number of people  
 who are busy reconstructing New Orleans.
[horn honks]
Ahh, watch out.
- # We're on the move #
- There are many silver linings 
 to this horrendous disaster,
and with it has come 
 an incredible opportunity.
- I'm optimistic when I see 
 a room full of folks
who want to take advantage 
 of the opportunities,
and that's a good thing 
 from our perspective.
It's a great thing.
- Well, you know, 
 it's like the Israelis say, you know.
Once in a while, 
 a good crisis is not bad.
You come up with new things.
- We were seeing a lot of new things.
But wasn't this supposed to be 
 about Gulf Coast reconstruction?
- We're especially interested 
 in Gulf Coast reconstruction,
and is this—does this 
 have anything to do with that?
- This is for bomb detonation 
 and ammunition storage.
- Perimeter and physical security, 
 mainly anti-ram road blockers.
- This particular unit can be used 
 in military applications.
- Wow, so it's a real, like, 
 catastrophe toilet, basically.
- All this stuff would be great 
 for the people of New Orleans
if they were gonna fight a war.
Where was the stuff 
 about helping people?
Ah, here it was.
The pavilion from Central Asia.
- Kyrgyz people are ready 
 to help the people
of Louisiana, Mississippi, 
 and Alabama
by erecting yurts there for them 
 as a temporary shelter.
[men singing in Kyrgyz]
- And here is the yurt.
- Oh, my God. 
 - This is it.
You can cover it up. 
 You can build a fire.
You can open it up.
And if there's a flood,
you can take it up 
 in less than an hour.
They're interested 
 in sending one free of charge
to Louisiana as a test 
 if you're interested, so—yep.
- The yurt was the only solution 
 here about helping people,
but the government reps 
 didn't seem very interested.
There's no money in yurts.
We decided we could outdo everyone 
 at this conference
and beat the free market 
 at its own game.
- # We're on the move #
- We would invent the ultimate 
 disaster technology,
a device so sophisticated
it could protect anyone 
 from pretty much anything.
But it would cost so much
that only the richest businessmen 
 could afford it.
- They kind of just flatten out. 
 - Yeah.
- The only question was: 
 what company would make such a thing?
- You've got to think Halliburton.
- # For they are the ones who do 
 the research to make the mud #
# To build the tool #
# To run in the well #
# To make the test #
# To log the zone #
# To set the packer #
# Cement the pipe and fire the gun #
# To perforate #
# To pump the gel that carries the sand #
# That props the frac #
# Completes the well #
# To produce the crude 
 that runs the world #
# For all the people all over the Earth #
# Who live in the house that oil built #
- Halliburton has been the world leader
in extracting profit 
 from every kind of disaster.
They made billions 
 off the first Gulf War and its sequel
and hundreds of millions off Katrina, 
 all paid for by the U.S. government,
whose vice president 
 was once their own CEO.
[men singing cheerfully]
- If anyone could make a killing 
 from total disaster,
Halliburton would be the one.
This morning, 
 we got up really early,
drove up to the very fancy hotel 
 which shall remain nameless
because they threatened us 
 if we use the material with their name.
But you know, what's it called, 
 basically, the hotel?
- Ritz-Carlton. 
 - Ritz-Carlton.
That one.
- How are you doing?
- I'm Northrop Goody.
I'm here with Halliburton, 
 with Fred Wolf.
I'm just helping demo a product, so...
Would either one of you mind 
 helping us demo the suits?
We have three of them.
So you have to actually 
 step into it, pull it on.
It's kind of like a coverall. 
 - All right, I'll wear it.
- You'll wear it? 
 - I'll wear it.
- All right, great! 
 - No problem.
- You're a good sport.
You're a really good sport. 
 - No problem.
- The Catastrophic Loss Conference
was for insurance people.
They knew numbers.
And we were about to show them 
 some pretty simple math.
[typewriter clacking]
With Gilda, we'd tried scary.
With Reggie, we'd tried gross.
Now we would go for ridiculous.
- We really appreciate being invited 
 to speak on this panel.
A lot of you work 
 with the insurance industry, of course.
Insurance has become 
 extremely worried
about some grave new dangers 
 to people
that we're seeing 
 in the world around us today.
I'm of course talking 
 about climate change
and the disasters that it brings.
But I can personally guarantee you 
 that level heads
will always be able 
 to turn lemons into lemonade.
Consider the Black Plague.
This was an unspeakably rotten event, 
 of course,
in which 1/3 of Europe's population 
 died in great agony.
No one of course would wish 
 such a thing on any civilization.
Yet without it,
without the Black Plague,
the old business models of Europe 
 would never have been overturned
by the entrepreneurs 
 of the Renaissance.
And what would the world be 
 without ^IThe Mona Lisa?^I
Or closer to home, 
 how about ^IThe Great Deluge?^I
This world-ending disaster, literally, 
 was surely seen as a terrible catastrophe
by Noah's contemporaries 
 and perhaps by Noah himself.
Yet Noah was ready to seize the day, 
 and at the end of that day,
not only was there a whole new world,
but Noah found himself 
 with a monopoly of the animals.
For those of us in positions 
 of responsibility, however,
who might have to 
 take charge in a crisis,
even more innovative solutions 
 are necessary.
I'd like now to introduce 
 my colleague here,
Dr. Northrop Goody,
who's the head of our Emergency 
 Products Development unit at Halliburton.
And Dr. Goody will be showing 
 some mock-ups
of some items 
 that his unit has developed.
[applause]
- We want something that's going 
 to be able to save a human being
no matter what Mother Nature 
 throws at him.
And so this is the answer.
This is the Halliburton Survivaball.
Its three easy steps for deployment:
suiting up, inflating, 
 and of course, launching—
launching out of a building.
And we have an artist's rendition
of what it might be like in Houston 
 when we launch our Survivaballs.
In the event of extreme catastrophe, 
 there might be a scarcity of resources.
In this case, 
 we've got a Survivaball here
that's going up and extracting resources,  
 in this case, from an animal.
And you don't want to be exposed 
 to the elements,
but you still want to be able 
 to extract resources from,
for example, a cow.
They're going to be able 
 to go underwater,
rated at 50 feet.
They can be used in any condition.
It doesn't matter whether
you're in a landslide 
 in California
or even in the Arctic.
Of course, any other conditions, 
 whether it's tsunamis or tornadoes,
the Survivaball is designed 
 to withstand.
But the best part of the Survivaball 
 is that people need people.
And so our biggest inspiration
for the way that a community 
 should work with Survivaballs
comes from biology.
As some of you probably know,
amoebas gather together 
 and actually form another body.
They aggregate.
And so these one-celled organisms 
 come together as a single body.
For example, here's a raft formation 
 of Survivaballs
in the ocean floating, 
 communicating, exchanging nutrients,
differentiating function.
Last of all,
this is, literally, 
 thousands of Survivaballs
dancing through the streets.
[applause]
- And we'll be happy 
 to take any questions.
So if there are any more technical ones 
 for Northrop here, or general ones.
- Yeah.
- If you could demonstrate 
 the turtle position, please,
that would be great.
Basically, if you duck down—
- Yeah, visor, heads-up display, 
 the whole thing.
- Yeah.
- Well, that's right.
- Hi.
Northrop.
- Gary. How are you?
- Well, it does. 
 That's it.
- Much more so than, you know, Katrina.
- Yeah, yeah, well, I mean—
We'd done all we could 
 to show these people
what sucked about letting greed 
 run our future.
- Oh, dear.
- But instead of freaking out,
they just took our business cards.
- Wonderful.
And if you want take 
 one of mine here.
- Our effort had been a failure.
- It's not very well articulated, really.
- And come to think of it,
all of our efforts 
 had been failures.
[bright orchestral music]
But, you know, 
 a Yes Man never gives up.
We knew we could do it.
All we needed 
 was a whole new approach.
Maybe making fun of stupid ideas 
 was a stupid idea.
We had to get smart,
because the people 
 with the really stupid ideas
were very, very smart.
For Friedman and his followers,
disaster was not just 
 a chance to get rich
but an opportunity to push through 
 all kinds of unpopular policies
like privatizing public schools,
shutting down public hospitals,
and kicking people out of their homes.
This is the Lafitte Housing Project.
It survived Katrina intact.
That was lucky 
 for the thousands of residents
who wanted to come home and rebuild.
So what did the government do?
They decided to tear it down.
- The disaster for us 
 started after the storm...
- Uh-huh.
- When people found out 
 that you were going to be marooned
in a strange foreign city 
 wanting to come home,
and the government 
 was going to take your home away.
- This was ours before the storm.
When storms happen everywhere else, 
 people get a chance to go back home.
This is home to us.
Why they gonna take away 
 our pride and joy?
They don't know what people 
 going through.
- It's a whole city 
 that sort of washed away.
Now you got to rebuild the whole thing.
So part of what this was is,
if you ever had an idea that you 
 couldn't get through before the storm,
well, the storm meant 
 that everything was,
you know, tossed salad.
So if this idea had been roundly rejected  
 by the city and by voters and whatever,
now's your chance to sneak on in.
- When residents tried 
 to come home after Katrina,
they found themselves 
 locked out by HUD,
the U.S. Government's Department 
 of Housing and Urban Development.
- The federal government 
 came up with a program
to dismantle public housing 
 and privatize it,
and that's what we're doing.
And so you've got to develop 
 a nice community
so that the poor 
 have an opportunity to live
in an environment 
 where people work,
that they're part 
 of the American Dream.
And you'll get a number of folks 
 that are not used to the type of lifestyle
that we all live where trash 
 is thrown on the ground
or cursing off of the balcony.
- The idea really 
 is to provide role models,
essentially, for poor folks, right?
- Absolutely. 
 - Mm-hmm.
- On the BBC, we'd tried to show 
 that companies could behave differently.
And we'd learned that they couldn't
until government made rules 
 to control them.
Yet even here in New Orleans, 
 where help was most needed,
government was also drinking 
 the free-market Kool-Aid.
- I believe in a market-driven process.
Economics, 
 capitalism is gonna take over,
and the marketplace 
 is poised to respond.
- So the government 
 didn't believe in government.
We knew what we had to do.
We would become the government,
and we would find out what would happen 
 if government did the right thing.
- We are preparing to go
to the Gulf Coast 
 Reconstruction Conference
at the Pontchartrain Center 
 in Kenner near the airport.
- You shouldn't drive.
- Okay.
So it's almost like we should be saying, 
 "We are facing a state of emergency."
I'm going to speak as HUD,
as the Deputy Assistant 
 of the Secretary of HUD,
who couldn't make it, 
 and CNN is going to be covering it live.
- This conference was taking place
on the first anniversary 
 of Katrina.
A thousand contractors who were 
 rebuilding New Orleans would be there.
What's that?
- Oh, my God.
Mayor Ray Nagin coming
is a bit more 
 than we expected would happen.
When we'd hatched our scheme,
we'd told this guy, 
 the conference organizer,
that we represented Alphonso Jackson, 
 the head of HUD.
When the mayor and governor 
 found out that Jackson would be there,
they had to be there too.
Once again, the keynote speaker 
 wouldn't show up,
but his assistant would.
Would the mayor notice 
 that something was wrong?
And what would 
 the contractors think
of HUD's radical new approach 
 to public housing,
an approach that could cost them money 
 and even put some of them out of a job?
- Please join me in welcoming 
 Mayor Ray Nagin of New Orleans.
[applause]
And please also join me 
 in welcoming Rene Oswin,
the Assistant Deputy Secretary 
 of the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development.
[applause]
- So it's an honor to share the stage
with our two partners in recovery, 
 with Rene Oswin, representing HUD,
who's definitely one of 
 our most important partners
in this rebuilding effort,
and Mayor Nagin of New Orleans, 
 whose challenges are enormous.
- And I also want to stop and thank Rene, 
 who's here from HUD.
HUD has been an incredible, 
 incredible partner with us.
We are on the verge of doing 
 some really unique things,
some things that we 
 could have never tackled
in the city of New Orleans,
and now we are poised 
 and positioned
to enhance public housing 
 in the city of New Orleans.
You know, there's lots 
 of information out there.
There's lots of misinformation 
 out there, you know, and—
but I have a fundamental belief
that truth and lie cannot stay 
 in the same place at the same time.
It reminds me of a story I once heard.
Truth and Lie went swimming one day 
 in Lake Pontchartrain.
They went skinny-dipping, 
 so they laid their clothes on the banks,
and they were out there 
 having a really good time.
But then Lie all of a sudden 
 jumped out the water,
put Truth's clothes on,
and started running down Esplanade— 
 Elysian Fields Avenue.
Truth got out the water,
started running after Lie.
So ladies and gentlemen, 
 what you had was
a well-dressed Lie 
 being chased by naked Truth.
[applause]
- That's quite a tough act to follow.
Nothing like that to make you 
 feel a bit naked, eh?
[laughter]
Dear friends, it is with the greatest joy  
 that I announce to you today
a brand-new department 
 of Housing and Urban Development.
Everything is going to change 
 about the way we work,
and the change is gonna start 
 right here today in New Orleans.
Until last week, 
 our M.O. here at HUD
was to tear down public housing 
 whenever we could.
Like many folks in Washington,
we felt that the projects 
 caused crime and unemployment.
We were wrong.
When we tore down St. Thomas
and replaced it 
 with mixed-income flats,
only 1 of 27 former residents 
 ever made it back,
and the rest have faced many problems, 
 in some cases, even homelessness.
It just didn't work.
We won't make that error again.
This afternoon, we will begin
to reopen all public housing projects 
 in New Orleans
and allow these Americans 
 to be part of their city once again.
[applause]
But opening doors—
[applause]
But opening doors won't be enough.
As you know, the main reason 
 New Orleans was so vulnerable to Katrina
was the destruction of the wetlands.
I am very, very, very pleased 
 to announce that Exxon and Shell
have agreed to finance 
 wetlands rebuilding
from part of the $60 billion 
 in profits this year.
As J. Stephen Simon,
Exxon Vice President, writes,
"ExxonMobil is earmarking $8.6 billion
"from revenues our company 
 has made in this region
"so as to assure
"that ExxonMobil 
 never again has a hand
in destroying a large American city."
[applause]
Ladies and gentlemen,
we will rebuild not just New Orleans.
We will rebuild the American Dream.
Please come join us 
 at the Lafitte Housing Complex
for a ribbon-cutting ceremony 
 immediately after the plenary session.
This is what we're all here for, 
 so let's make it happen.
Let's bring New Orleans back.
[applause]
- I thought it was very uplifting.
This has been a big problem.
A lot of people want to come home, 
 and they have been unable to do so.
So I thought it was 
 a very positive message.
- Very encouraging.
And what's really encouraging 
 in particular
is not only getting people back home 
 and helping them rebuild,
but the recognition that 
 we have to deal with Mother Nature,
and that Exxon is going to make 
 some significant contribution
to restore wetlands is— 
 it's very encouraging.
[applause]
- This was encouraging.
When the contractors heard 
 that the government
was gonna do the right thing,
even though it might cost them 
 some business, they cheered.
Friedman was wrong.
Greed alone didn't rule the world.
- Hi.
- My name's Steve Strader, WWL. 
 You mind if I talk to you over here?
- Absolutely. 
 - Do you have a card?
- Oh, not today.
- And this time, 
 we'd gotten away with it.
Or so we thought.
- The city and the state both say 
 they've not heard anything about this.
This announcement 
 comes as a surprise
to the governor's office 
 and the mayor's office.
Why would HUD do this without 
 consulting the city and the state?
- Well, it's such a—
we haven't done this 
 without consulting with them.
- You have no cards? 
 You say you're new to the agency?
- I have a card, 
 but it's back at the office.
I'll get it to you.
- Where is your PR team?
- I'm right here. Hi. 
 - There.
- Hi, you're with HUD? 
 Do you have a card?
- There's an entire HUD 
 housing project there left unfinished.
Yeah.
- There are some saying 
 that this is a farce,
that you're not truly with HUD,
and that this is not 
 an actual announcement.
- Well, they can say whatever they want.
Who are these people?
- Where is your office?
- In Washington. 
 - Where in Washington?
- He just joined the agency from France.
- From France?
- Yeah, he's been a special attaché
to the Department of the Interior 
 in France.
Why are you so skeptical?
- I just heard the speech, 
 and I have a newscast very shortly.
I need to confirm if it was 
 a real speech from HUD or not.
The governor and the mayor 
 knew nothing of it.
They were shocked.
We desperately need to know 
 if this is real or not.
He's standing right here,
the man who just apparently 
 committed this hoax on your department.
Okay, I'm on the phone with HUD right now,  
 and they say you're a liar.
- Okay, well, they can say 
 whatever they want.
I mean—
- I'm sorry?
- They can say whatever they'd like.
- "They can say whatever they'd like."
But you work for them, 
 don't you, as a deputy secretary?
- That's right.
Now that you've been discovered,
do you want to explain to me 
 why you did it?
I mean, if you're trying to make a point,
why don't you come over here 
 and tell me why you did this?
All right, all right, man. 
 I'll call you in a few minutes.
But it is a hoax, 
 a massive hoax perpetrated today.
You just pulled off a heck of a hoax.
- Thank you.
I mean, I would say that, you know,
HUD is pulling off a hoax by pretending
that tearing down affordable housing 
 is what's gonna solve it.
I mean, that's what they've 
 been doing until now.
This is a time when all of these people 
 are clamoring to get back in.
They want to get back into their housing,
and they deserve to be there.
It's crazy.
- And worth lying to all these people 
 to try to make your point.
Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
Actually telling the truth.
This is actually truth-telling where  
 normally there would only be lies.
How difficult would it be to remediate 
 what you see here today
and make it inhabitable, 
 say, next week?
- Just take off the covers here.
- Oh, yeah. 
 That's a good start, yeah?
- Absolutely.
- Finally, we will be reopening 
 public housing for the residents,
for the workforce 
 that's going to move back in
and again rebuild New Orleans.
- Sick, twisted, cruel.
Those are all words used 
 to describe the prank
on Louisiana officials 
 and about a thousand contractors
in New Orleans today.
- I'm Deputy Assistant Secretary to—
of the assistant, essentially, 
 of Secretary Alphonso Jackson.
- Rene Oswin can't get his title right
or his relationship to HUD Secretary 
 Alphonso Jackson.
- Yay!
- After taking the mayor for a ride,
these contractors followed him
to a makeshift ribbon-cutting 
 at the Lafitte Housing Project.
- Mr. Oswin, you're not even 
 on the directory of HUD.
You're not even listed.
You don't even have a phone number.
- It's come to that, has it?
It's come to that.
Well, thanks for being the one 
 to break the news.
- HANO, The Housing Authority 
 of New Orleans
says this is simply a cruel, cruel joke,
trying to give people 
 some kind of fake hope
that they were going to be able 
 to move back.
- But I guess it's just to call their hand.
It's just to call their hand.
I respect this hoax,
because maybe it'll take a hoax 
 like this to bring 'em out here
to see what we going through.
So if the hoax what it be, 
 a hoax is what we got.
And I ain't mad.
I'm going to have me some barbecue.
[cheerful laughter]
- I think what you guys exposed
is the fact that HUD 
 could do these great things
if they wanted to.
Secondly, you got the attention 
 of the residents,
so now they're gonna begin to ask,
"Well, why aren't you doing these things?"
And number three, you are creating 
 a controversy to feed off,
to organize, and to build 
 the struggle to the next level.
So in my opinion, 
 everything y'all did was excellent.
- It had all been worthwhile.
We were on top of the world.
But then reality began to sink in.
[water bubbling]
We'd made a splash, 
 but we hadn't fixed the world.
The free market 
 was still destroying New Orleans.
All over the world, 
 people were losing their homes.
Climate change kept getting worse.
And in Bhopal, 
 people continued to suffer.
We really did need to fix the world,
but it was gonna take more
than two guys with cheap suits 
 and fake websites.
It would take millions of us.
[people shouting]
But even as old regimes 
 were swept away,
we knew that real change 
 wouldn't come easy.
After all, the free market cult 
 was still here.
- Wealth. 
 - Money.
- Privatization. 
 - Wealth.
- Money. 
 - Free markets.
- Privatization. 
 - Ownership.
- A great deal of money.
Now, we can afford that.
- Remember these guys?
They're not going away.
And neither would we.
We needed a really ambitious plan,
because all we ever read 
 in the newspapers was how we needed
to put everything back on track, 
 back to how it was before it fell apart.
But how it was was the problem.
We needed to show 
 what real change could look like.
So together with a whole lot of friends,
we would blanket Manhattan 
 with 100,000 copies
of our very own newspaper.
We'd call it ^IThe New York Times,^I
except our ^INew York Times^I 
 would be a little bit different.
Ours would be set 
 six months in the future.
It would show what could happen 
 if we set our imagination free.
- Things have gotten pretty bad,
and I think it's hard for people to imagine 
 the world working another way.
So we're trying to, 
 as realistically as possible,
present this world as it could be.
- They just brought in the proof
of ^IThe New York Times,^I 
 and it looks un-[...]-believable.
- Really good.
- The obvious question, 
 how the heck did you do it?
Andy, you want to start?
How long were you working on this thing,  
 and how many of you?
- Well, there were a lot of us.
It wasn't just the Yes Men.
It was a large group of people.
We were just one of many groups.
It was an idea that sparked 
 a lot of people's imaginations.
They wanted to see this happen,
and that's sort of the message 
 of the paper as well,
is that, great, we elected Obama, 
 and that's fantastic.
But now the real work begins.
- The idea was to put out something 
 that was optimistic,
that says we can do all these things.
Why not?
We created this system 
 that we have now,
so why not create 
 a good one instead?
- Wow. 
 - Very good.
Here, let me tie you up. 
 This is the big day.
7:00 a.m. 
 Rush hour.
This is the time 
 to get the papers out there.
- Morning.
Free ^ITimes.^I
Special issue.
Special issue.
- Free ^INew York Times.^I
- Special edition 
 of ^IThe New York Times.^I
- Free ^INew York Times.^I
- Is this real?
- It's fake, right?
- Who publishes this?
- Can I grab another one please?
What?
- What?
- Free ^INew York Times.^I
- "National Health Insurance Act passes."
- "The PATRIOT Act repealed."
- "Maximum wage law succeeds."
Good luck with that one.
- This is too good to be true.
But it's not impossible.
- It's a dream newspaper.
Right?
It's like you wake up 
 and all the things that you wanted
became the news.
- The war is over!
- Our fake news was a hit.
But would the real news pick it up?
- You don't work 
 for ^IThe New York Times.^I
Who is that you work for 
 handing this out?
- A guy named John, John Smith.
Yeah. 
 - John who?
- John Smith?
- It's ^IThe New York Times^I special edition.
Is there anything wrong with it?
- Yeah, 
 it's not ^IThe New York Times.^I
- Read all about it.
^IThe New York Times^I 
 declares the war in Iraq is over.
- Some commuters got their hands 
 on what looks like
a special edition 
 of ^IThe New York Times.^I
As you might have guessed, 
 though, it's a fake.
- [speaking German]
- [speaking French]
- We printed a paper with the headlines 
 that we'd like to see.
So if these are the headlines 
 that people were so excited
to read this morning, 
 let's make them happen.
- I think we're going to have 
 to exercise some muscles
we either don't have 
 or that have atrophied or something,
a civic muscle, a thrifty muscle, 
 a generous muscle.
- We've got to take back our government,
march into City Hall, and say, 
 "Here, we've got the solutions."
- We can think of the different ways
that we can contribute 
 to a movement that says
business as usual is unacceptable,
because people are being hurt,
and we're not gonna play the role, 
 the subservient,
routine role that we usually play.
- Let's go.
- We're going. 
 We're going.
- Come on.
[people cheering]
- Make change happen.
Put, you know, put your effort on the line 
 to make something happen.
And that's what kind of we did here, 
 and, you know,
it's what—yeah, it's kind of— 
 yeah, oh, boy.
- And if a few people at the top 
 can make the bad news happen,
then why can't all of us at the bottom
get together and make 
 the good news happen for a change?
I mean, for real.
[thoughtful music]
[joyful instrumental music]
