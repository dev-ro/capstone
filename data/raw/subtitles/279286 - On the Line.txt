KEVIN SINGING: Aw, one, two

TEEN SINGING:

KEVIN:
Princes, princes who adore you
-Just go ahead now
-One has--
TEEN:

This one said
he wants to buy you rockets
Ain't in his head
Marry him or marry me
KEVIN: It aII started
because of a girI at a party.
KEVIN SINGING: I ain't got
no future or famiIy tree
KEVIN: Spring, 1 99 4.
That was our band--Gr anite.
We were aII about the rock.
I mean, we were hardcore.

Just go ahead now
And if you want

Just go ahead now
And if you Iike to taIk

Just go ahead now
Go ahead now
-CROWD: Gr anitel Gr anitel
-[Feedback]
CROWD: Granite! Granite!
KEVIN:
And this was the moment.
My big chance to impress
the girI of my dreams.
-Kev, l got a great idea.
-What?
Why don't we just sing
the ballad that l wrote...
dedicate it to her...
and then when it's over,
just ask her out.
What are you, stupid?
She's right there.
AII right,
Iet's do the baIIad.
l can do this.
GIRL: Gr anitel
GUlTARlST:
Yeah, Kevin, you can do it.
-Come on, Kevin.
-Don't be such a wuss.
-Come on, just do it.
-Kevin.
KEVIN: I didn't do it.
I just froze.
Come on, Kevin,
don't be a tulip!
KEVIN:
My heart started pounding.
-My pits started sweating.
-CROWD: Aw...
I feIt naked up there.
-Kevin.
-Kevin!
[Laughter]
What is it?
[Thud]
I can't beIieve it, man.
That story gets funnier
every time I hear it.
Yeah.
Thanks for the support.
Man, come on.
You know what your probIem is?
l think it's
a lack of self-confidence.
l mean, l know you go out
on dates and everything...
but l think when you find
the girl of your dreams...
you can't seaI the deaI,
you know?
Pick the fruit, spit the wad.
-You know what l'm saying?
-No, l don't.
BO Y: I think what your friend
is trying to say...
is that you're suffering
from a cIassic psychosomatic...
communicative anxiety disorder.
BasicaIIy, you meet
the right girI, you choke.
That's what l was saying.
Dude, you got to relax.
Watch me work.
French fry?
[Bell rings]
FKR.
How can l direct your call?
HoId, pIease.
Yeah.
Have it under controI?
Good morning, Margie.
FKR.
How can l direct your call?
-Hold, please.
-OK.
-Hey, baby
-Hey, baby
-Yeah, baby
-Yeah, baby
-Hey, baby
-Hey, baby
-Yeah, baby
-Yeah, baby
Oops.
[Women chattering and laughing]
Hey, Nathan, how's it going?
l got to spend another
one of my remaining days...
in this purgatory.
l got cataracts
the size of cantaloupes...
and l haven't had
a decent bowel movement...
since
the Reagan administration.
OK.
[Baseball game on TV]
So, are you ever going to
tell me about that baseball?
No.
[Mechanical whir]
[Machine beeping]
Come on, Lucille.
Don't die on me now.
Daddy knows you're tired...
but daddy aIso knows
you got another few in you.
Yes, you do.
Do you really think that works?
Sometimes,
but when it doesn't...
you give her
a little love tap.
[Clunk]
[Machine whirs]
Uhh.
Good morning, Jackie.
JACKIE: Good morning.
Uh, Gibbons?
l need you in here, please.
HIGGINS: You've done
exceIIent work here...
and now Iet me
ask you a question.
What does Reebok stand for?
Um, I beIieve the Reebok
is a type of African gazeIIe.
[Loud whirring]
No. Reebok stands
for credibility and prestige.
We are going global.
Wheatgrass?
l'll pass.
Reebok wants us to do...
their female 'tweens
footwear campaign.
-'Tweens?
-'Tweens, Gibbons--
for females between their
adolescence and teen years.
Get with it, Gibbons.
Ohh. Jackie,
could you come in here, please?
Mr. Higgins, this is such
a great opportunity for me.
l don't know what to say.
Well, then don't say anything.
l might change my mind.
You wanted to see me?
Yes. How's the Reebok campaign
coming along?
Excellent, sir.
l haven't completed the concept
yet, but l'm close.
Well, you just got
a little bit closer.
Gibbons here
is joining the creative team.
Hmm.
KEVIN: OK, Reebok.
All right.
We have two baby chickens...
and they're both wearing
Reeboks.
One is going, ''Ree.''
The other is going, ''Bok.''
Reebok, Reebok.
That's moronic, moronic.
-[Sighs]
-[Squeaks]
-l got it.
-lmagine my excitement.
Wait. OK. Picture this.
You have girls at a party,
girls on the soccer field...
girls at a concert...
all wearing Reebok.
And the tag line?
For girls who choose to move.
MAN SINGING: Yeah, baby
What do you think?
l think the wheatgrass...
has finally gone
to Higgins's head...
for putting you on the team.
You liked it that much?
Look, l've worked
at this office for five years.
l've got seniority on you.
This should be my account.
You don't like me very much,
do you?
Brilliant deduction, Scooby.
Now let's get back to work and
come up with some good ideas.
AL GREEN SINGING:
Hey, didn't go for that
It's a natur aI fact
Now I wanna come back
Won't you show me
where it's at
KEVIN SINGING: Where it's at
I'm so tired of being aIone
I'm so tired of on my own
Won't you heIp me, girI
Just as soon as you can
AL GREEN:
Yeah, I guess you know
That I Iove you so
Sorry.
AL GREEN:
You don't want me no more
[Turns off music]
ABBEY: I Can't Next to You.
KEVIN: Excuse me?
I'm So Tired of Being AIone
is a great AI Green song...
but l Can't Get Next to You...
seems a little more appropriate
right now.
And why's that?
Because
l can't get next to you.
Oh.
ABBEY: Ahem. Thanks.
Ahem.
l enjoyed your performance.
Thanks.
Al Green
helps me clear my head.
lt's a mental thing.
Yikes.
l hear he's playing at
the Opera House in two weeks.
Maybe he's looking
for an opening act.
You like the Reverend?
[Laughs] My mom was listening
to Love and Happiness...
when she was in labor with me.
l think he's...
definitely in my soul. Ha ha.
So...
what do you do besides approach
strange men on the ''L''?
l go to school--grad school.
-What do you study?
-Archeology.
Archeology.
What do you do...
besides serenade
strange people on the ''L''?
Oh, wait. Wait, wait.
Let me guess.
You are an ad man.
Now, how did you do that?
lt's stitched on your bag.
[Laughs]
Have you done anything
l might've seen?
l don't know. Uh...
l had a hand in the Pop Secret
popcorn campaign.
[Sings]
Butter makes it better, baby
That's it. That's me.
l actually wrote that.
So now when l go to Wrigley
and root for the Cubbies...
l can look up at the big
Pop Secret billboard...
and think of you.
-You're a Cubs fan?
-Heck, yeah. Born and raised.
All right, all right.
Um, so, tell me.
Tell me your best and worst
Cub moment.
-Best--whenever they win.
-Of course.
Worst--game five
in the '84 playoffs.
BOTH: The ground ball
went through Durham's legs.
That is the worst moment
of my life.
Horrible.
l was so depressed.
l didn't even go to school
the next day.
l cried.
OK, most guys
wouldn't admit that.
Yeah. l don't know why
l just told you that.
DRIVER: Next stop, Adams--
Adams and Wabash.
That's my stop.
[Laughs]
Mine, too.
After you.
Thank you.
So, tell me something that
you would only tell a stranger.
Uh...whoo.
l like to make paper airplanes.
My dad's a pilot.
Really?
Oh, wait.
Do you have a piece of paper?
Yeah, sure.
What, am l going to get
a little demonstration?
Uh-huh. A little demonstration.
Thank you.
That's very impressive.
Thank you.
lt's my own design.
Ah.
All right,
this is my favorite spot.
-So, you've done this before?
-Many times.
-You ready?
-l guess.
Here we go.
Strong takeoff. Smooth flight.
Excellent paper airplane.
ABBEY: Thank you.
Ohl Ha ha hal
KEVIN: But I think your
Ianding needs a IittIe work.
Yeah, a little.
Definitely.
All right, don't think
you're getting off so easy.
-lt's your turn.
-l don't know. Um...
Let's see. Uhh.
OK. You're totally
going to think l'm lame...
but l can name
all the presidents in order.
Washington, Adams,
Jefferson, Madison...
Monroe, Adams,
Jackson, Van Buren...
Harrison, TyIer, PoIk,
TayIor, FiIImore...
Pierce, Buchanan,
LincoIn, Johnson, Gr ant...
Hayes, Garfield, Arthur,
Cleveland, Harrison...
BOTH:
McKinley, Roosevelt, Taft...
Wilson, Harding, Coolidge,
Hoover, Roosevelt, Truman...
Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson...
Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan,
Bush, Clinton, Bush.
-Wow.
-Ha ha!
OK, l think we're the only
two people in the world...
who can do that
at the same time.
l think you may be right.
[Laughs] OK, that's amazing.
Um, l got to catch
the connecting train.
Right. Um...
Well, listen,
it was a pleasure...
commuting with you.
Yeah, it really was.
Well...
bye.
Ha ha!
Come on
Love is Iike a bomb, baby,
come on, get it on
Livin' Iike a Iover

Break it up
Pour some sugar on me
Ooh, in the name of Iove
Yo, man, come on,
tell me what happened.
You're sitting on the train.
She stands up.
Doors open. She's about to
get off, but she stops, right?
Did you say something to her?
l said it was a pleasure
commuting with her.
''lt was a pleasure
commuting with you?''
I'm hot
Oh, that's great.
You couldn't say, like--
[Coughs] From my head
OK, fine. l tanked.
-Again?
-Man, you need some help.
Yeah.
[Feedback]
[Crowd cheers, whistles]
Yeah!
MAN:
Come onl Owl Whool Man.
-What's up, guys?
-Hey, that was hot, man.
lt was great.
lt was fantastic.
lt stunk. l can't freakin'
believe these guys.
Man, I mean,
the band was just awfuI.
Dude, it wasn't that bad.
Come on, l was in the band.
You.
You should've never--
Don't even start this, man.
You should've never
quit the band.
Gentlemen,
this is the oldest argument.
lt was a high school band.
No, it wasn't.
You know what it was.
Yeah. lt was the best
high school band ever!
BOTH: Granite! Granite!
Granite! Granite!
Gimme some! Gimme some!
Gimme some! Gimme some!
The chicks were hot, man.
They were great.
Yeah. Oh, my gosh.
ls that Brady freakin' Frances?
You didn't know he wrote
a coIumn for the Post?
-No.
-Ooh, that's right. l forgot.
You just skip
right to the Family Circus.
Hey, Family Circus
is a good comic.
lt's, like, one square,
and then you're done with it.
-Brady Frances--
-No, Brady Frances--
the guy that Kevin
swooped in on his girl...
back in high school prom time,
you remember?
Oh, my goodness. That was
a freakin' classic, man.
lt was a calamity
is what it was.
That's not exactly
what happened.
-Aw, man.
-That was seven years ago.
l got another set, guys,
to do, so...
-Hey, play something good.
-OK.
Hey, look, man, let's face it.
You're twenty-four years old.
lt's not the first time
you ever choked with a chick.
You know what l'm saying?
You got a problem.
Yeah, but this is different.
l mean,
this girl was incredible.
Yeah?
You know, it's embarrassing
when everyone knows you...
as the guy that always chokes.
Hey, man, come on.
Not everybody knows that.
Two more, please.
[Playing guitar]
Kevin, this one's for you.
Kevin sits siIentIy stiII
In the dead of the day
Huh?
Wonderin'
if he finds that girI
That just waIked away
Hmm...
Was it something he said
or something he did
Did the words
not come out right
He didn't try
to get the digits
He didn't try
But I guess
that's why they say
Kevin cr apped out on his own
[Pats back]
Uh...now everybody knows.
But his friends
wouId've heIped him aII aIong
That poor bonehead
Aw, man, you can
track her down, you know.
-How?
-l don't know. Lojack.
You could ride the train
every day looking for her.
You could put up posters
all over town. l don't know.
Yeah. ''Single white male
seeks commuter on train...
to share intimate secrets.''
Yeah, bud, that's kind of cool,
but l was thinking more like...
''Dog who loses bone
seeks train tramp.''
[Barks]
Brain damage.
[Door opens]
[Door closes]
-Hey, you. You're back.
-Hey.
So, how was your weekend
in Chicago, hmm?
Mmm. lt was fine.
Wait, wait, wait.
Sit.
You just spent the weekend with
your boyfriend of 3 years...
who you haven't seen
in over a month.
That deserves a ''phenomenal''
or at least an ''exceptional''...
but definitely not
just a ''fine.'' What is up?
l found a great apartment
in Lakeview.
lt's right by Wrigley...
and l can move in
right after graduation.
But l thought that...
that you and Paul
were going to move in together.
[Sighs]
l don't know, Sam.
Everything is so different.
[Laughs]
What?
l met a guy on the train.
You met a guy on the train?
Yes. He was so cute,
and he was so nice.
And he totally listened to me.
Uhh.
We connected more
in five minutes...
than l have with Paul
over the past year.
Ha ha!
Abbey. Ha ha!
Well, you already know
Jackie...
so let me introduce the new
member of my creative team...
Kevin Gibbons.
And may I say that my team
has come up with a campaign...
that I feeI you wiII aII agree
has universaI appeaI.
So, without any further ado...
allow me to present...
[Sighs]
And the tag line is...
''Reebok--step into the future.''
[Crickets chirping]
[Gulp]
[Whispering]
-lt's a little, uh, cold.
-Hmm?
We were hoping
for something more lively...
with a little more depth.
-Huh.
-Actually--
Actually, we totally agree.
That's why l--we came up
with something so fabulous.
Did we?
Well, l don't like surprises,
you know.
Mmm.
Let me present to you...
what we beIieve wiII be
Reebok's new campaign.
Ahem.
GirIs at a party...
girls at school,
girls at a concert...
girIs at a soccer fieId--
aII wearing Reeboks.
The tagline?
''For girls who choose to move.''
-But that's--
-That's great.
When can you have it by?
Uh, Kevin here could
make copies of the mock-ups...
and messenger them
over to you...
by the end of the business
day, couIdn't you, Kevin?
Sure.
HIGGINS:
WonderfuI, wonderfuI.
PhenomenaI work, Jackie.
l didn't say anything.
l didn't say anything.
l know why.
l know why. lt's because
l'm afraid to take a chance.
Because l'm afraid
to take a chance.
[Sighs]
[Copy machine whirring]
l'm sitting on the sidelines
all my life.
Why am l so scared?
Always afraid to take a chance.
MAN SINGING: I'm Iayin' it
on the Iine to show you
I'II never Iet you go
On the Iine for your Iove
There's nothing I want more
Another dead-end street

[Video game beeping]
WOMAN: Chicago DaiIy Post.
May I heIp you?
Br ady Fr ances's desk.
[Video game music playing]
Brady, my office.
This is your next story.
lt's a compelling
human interest piece.
But, sir,
l want to do hard news.
Uh-huh. And l want
a clear nasal passage.
We can't always get
what we want.
[Snorts]
Uhh. You know...
l put you in personals because
most people are miserable...
and l think you can relate,
Brady.
The kid's name
is Kevin Gibbons.
-Kevin Gibbons?
-We checked it out.
Huh. l can't. l know him.
So?
Look, you don't understand.
l have a history with this guy.
[School bell rings]
Dude, l'm telling you...
you ask out a girl
like Kayla Sanders...
and you're setting yourself
up for rejection...
humiIiation, aIienation.
BRAD Y: Don't worry.
I've got determination.
Hey, Kayla.
Brady Frances.
We're in French class together.
l'm the one
that always gets nosebleeds.
Would you like to go
to the prom with me?
Hold on a second.
-Hey, Kevin.
-Hi.
Would you like to go
to the prom with me?
Sure. l'd love to.
Sorry.
l'm already going to the prom
with Kevin Gibbons.
[Softly] No.
Kevin Gibbons.
[School bell rings]
[Sighs]
Let me get this straight.
You harbor animosity
towards this Kevin...
because some girl
wanted to go to the prom...
with him instead of you?
Well--
Spellbinding pity,
but the story's still yours.
[Sighs] Yes, sir.
Hey, hey, and Brady...
Now get out of here
and don't mess this one up.
Jenna, yeah.
l changed my 1 2:00 lunch.
[Sighs]
lt's payback time.
[Telephone rings]
Hey, dude,
you don't look so good.
-Really?
-Yeah.
[Ring]
Really.
You usually look better.
What, can you not hear
the phone?
-[Ring]
-Jaundice?
-Kind of. Kind of yellow.
-Where's the phone?
Is my Adam's appIe
aII pathetic?
Hello?
WOMAN: HeIIo, Kevin, it's me,
the girI from the ''L'' Tr ain.
lt's you. Wow.
l didn't think you'd call.
-Of course l called.
-How are you?
That's the chick
from the train.
BOTH: ls that the chick
from the train?
Dude, is that the chick
from the--
[Whispering]
Shut up.
Oh, yeah, it's got to be.
So, uh, can we meet up?
Chugga, chugga, choo, choo.
How about Goody's diner?
BOTH: Choo, choo!
1 :00?
All right.
BOTH:
Chugga, chugga, choo, choo!
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
BOTH: Yeah! Ow! Whoo!
WOMAN SINGING: This is my one
chance to be a rock star
Come on and caII me
This is my image,
these are my dances
[Exhales]
ABBEY: Hi.
[Classical music playing]
What?
No, no, no.
The sucker's going to split
in a matter of days.
Yeah. No.
Now is not the time to sell.
OK.
[Sighs] Work.
You know, you didn't have
to come up this weekend.
That's OK. Hey, come on.
It's my turn.
Besides, I got some work done
on the tr ain.
[Sitar music playing]
l don't mean to be rude,
but why are you here?
When l saw your poster,
l just knew l had to meet you.
l could tell
that we would have...
a cosmic connection.
You sensed that from a poster?
Yes.
How's school?
Oh, hectic,
with finals next week.
Well, soon, you'll be
back home in Chicago...
we'll be together,
and you can relax.
Actually, l was thinking
l want to volunteer...
for the Field Museum
when l get back.
Abbey...
l appreciate, you know,
your fossil hobby, but--
Paul...
it's not just a hobby.
-You're a water sign.
-No.
[Jewelry jingles]
Oh. Uh-huh.
-Virgo.
-Uh-uh.
Oh. You see, Kevin...
astrology is actually
chock-full of--Shoot!
What?
Pork.
Get this away from me.
lt's OK. lt's OK.
Listen, pork happens.
-Don't patronize me.
-Excuse me?
What do you take me for,
some kind of freak?
You did call me out of the blue
from a poster.
Well, that's because
l thought we had a connection--
a cosmic connection, Kevin.
And l thought maybe you'd be
different, but you're not.
You're all the same--
all of you.
And l don't have to take this.
l'm from Oregon.
What are you looking at?
Ow! What did l do?
[Door closes]
PAUL: I'm going to have
to caII you Iater, OK?
Yeah.
[Sighs]
So, where were we?
-We were talking about us.
-We were?
-No, but l think we should.
-Well, Abbey--
Paul, the only time
you got excited today...
is when your phone rang.
l'm beginning to feel
like three's a crowd.
Well, l think l've got a way
of making it up to you.
What's that I see?
Yes, we have a smiIe.
Ha!
Al Green at the Opera House?
Just you and me. We're going
to have a great time.
[Cell phone rings,
cash register rings]
Yeah?
[Breaks wind]
ERIC: Oh, man.
You wash your grimy butt...
in my tub again, you're
going to have to pay rent.
Well, excuse me.
l mean, l got to frickin'
take a shower.
Mine's busted at my apartment,
and l got a gig tonight...
so l don't want to smell
like B.O.
That's why that record contract
has remained so elusive.
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, nice shot.
-You're a philistine.
-[Breaks wind]
You're a flatulent philistine.
ERIC:
Get out of here, man.
Mick! Mick! Mick! Mick!
Mick! Mick! Mick! Mick!
Welcome back to TRL, you guys.
Times Square, New York City
is off the hook...
because this man
has entered the studio.
-Hey, Rod.
-Yeah.
-Your hero's on TV.
-No way!
HOS T:
I have great news for you.
You have made TRL history.
The video for Every Cloud
has a Silver Lining--
twenty-six straight weeks
at number one.
You broke your own record,
dude.
You broke your own record!
That has to feel amazing.
How does it feel?
You know,
the Mick won the record...
but the Mick lost the record
at the same time.
So unfortunately, there has
to be a winner and loser.
ln this case, the Mick is both,
so the Mick feels conflicted.
HOS T:
Either way it goes, you win.
Dude, l can't believe this guy.
What is wrong with
the music industry today, huh?
l graduated from the school
of hard knocks, you know...
but that's what keeps
the Mick so grounded.
He is not about the love.
He's not about the passion.
Dude, l'm about the love.
-And the passion.
-And the odor.
Manl
But the Mick's
going to show his mad love...
for Chi-town later this week.
HOS T: Oh, he's going home.
He's going home!
That's right.
Give it up for Mick on TRL!
-Hey, at least he has a degree.
-Uhh! This guy's a tool.
l am--l am--l am...
[Telephone rings]
l got it.
[Ring]
Yo, it's the ''E'' to the ''R''
to the ''l'' to the ''C''...
ln the place to be.
That's me. What--what?
Brady freakin' Frances?
-Brady Frances?
-From the paper?
Yo, what up, kid?
Oh, man, I'm chiIIin'--
just cooIin' as the other side
of the piIIow...
you know what l'm saying?
BRAD Y:
Uh, I don't get it.
No, like when you wake up
late at night, and you--
Forget it, dude.
What you want? For reaI?
Yeah, yeah, man.
Hang on a second.
Yo, he wants to interview you
for the paper.
He got one of those posters...
and he wants to talk about
the girl from the train.
[Laughs] No way.
Way. Just chill for a second.
Think about this.
lf you get your name in print,
and people start seeing you...
as some guy
who's going to take a risk...
you're not going
to be known...
as the guy who can't
seal the deal anymore, right?
l'm not doing an interview.
Kev, come on. l think it would
be a great PR move for you.
lt'll help you find her.
-OK.
-Cool.

HlGGlNS: Ha ha ha ha!
[Laughing]
Gibbons. Oh ho ho!
Oh, Gibbons...
why don't you just offer
a reward?
Like with a lost puppy?
Ha ha ha! Oh!
Oh, son, it's so sad.
You've gotten it
all bass-ackwards.
Look, first
you get the power...
then you get the money...
and then you buy the love.
Oh. Gibbons, pIease.
Don't be a dummy.
[Phone beeps]
WOMAN:
Reebok's on the Iine.
Could you ask them to hold,
please?
Focus on the job at hand.
Money makes the world

money is the root of all evil--
WOMAN:
Doesn't have any.
Hello?
WOMAN: Are you taIking to
the young man from the tr ain?
Yes.
WOMAN: We'd Iike him
to head up the creative team.
-Really?
-Really?
WOMAN: Reebok can use peopIe

Yo, what's up, fellas?
What's up? Man,
No-Action Jackson over here...
keeps talking about
the girl from the train.
Man, are you serious? Would you
cut it out already, dude?
You're like the poster boy for
the romantically challenged.
Hey, yo, this guy needs a date.
Hey, anybody read
the newspaper today?
This is the guy
from the train...
who put up that poster
trying to find that girl.
-Would you shut up?
-Oh, that's so romantic.
-l have a daughter.
-Oh, yeah? Does she eat meat?
ANNOUNCER: Now batting...
l don't know
why l tell you guys anything.
ANNOUNCER: Fred McGriff.
Listen,
l don't even understand this.
l mean, it's like
maybe you thought her up...
in your mind
or some stuff like that.
lt's like you think
she's, like, Julia Roberts...
but in reality,
she's like Dr. Ruth.
As usual, Rod,
l have no clue what you mean.
Hey, you really think
this babe is going to call you?
l don't know. l just wish
l knew where she was.
ANNOUNCER: The Cubs have had
3 opportunities to score...
in as many at-bats today.
And TeIemacho jumps ahead
of him two quick strikes.
Ha ha! Now, l can't believe
Brady hooked you up...
with that article
in the paper...
considering you dissed
and dismissed his ass...
back in high school.
Don't you have some work to do?
ANNOUNCER: And here's
Sammy Sosa in the fourth.
Sammy hit into a 6-4-3
inning-ending doubIe pIay...

The Cubs have had
3 opportunities to score...
Oh! Oh!
-Ho ho!
-Ooh, that's got to hurt.
PLAYER: I can't beIieve
he's hit that guy three times.
Damn! That's the third time
this season l hit this guy.

WOMAN: You want nuts

Yeah, sure, whatever.
[Sighs]
Hmm.
You think she'll call him?
-Ha! You think l care?
-You should care.
You're writing
the follow-up article on him.
l hope she does call.
He seems sweet.
Kevin Gibbons is a gimp.
He's making
a complete idiot of himself.
l mean,
l can't even believe...
people are taking
the article seriously.
What do you have
against this guy?
Nothing. l just don't see
what the big deal is.
Well, he took a chance.
He went for something.
l think--l think women
like that. lt's romantic.

That's for using my towel

Oh, my gosh, dude.
What is this?
-lt's a hot dog.
-Thanks, man.
No problem.
-Sure it's done?
-Safe!
So, Kev,
l bet you're wondering why...
we asked you out
to play barbecue ball...
this fine, cold day in Chicago.
-'Cause l brought the food?
-No!
Well, yeah, kind of,
but also because...
l came up with
this really brilliant idea.
Actually, it's more like
a proposition for you.
Why am l afraid to hear this?
l don't know. Me and the guys
were just thinking that...
you could do all these babes,
like, a big, huge favor...
and let us take them out.
And how is that possibly
a good idea?
First off...
there are just way too many
calls for you to handle solo...
and secondly...
Rod?
What was number two?
Oh!
We screen the girls...
and we help you find
''the girl.''
-Yes!
-Yeah.
And if, perchance, you know...
we were to make
some kind of connection...
with one
of these fine young Iadies...
well, so much the better.
Yeah! We all win big.
Wienie.
-Cha-ching.
-That's not a bad idea.
l can't believe
l didn't think of that.
Rod, yeah!
l told you he'd go for it.
-l gave you a couple days.
-Absolutely not, guys.
Game's over. See you later.
Um...l say he's coming around.
That went pretty well.
FKR.
Gibbons!
-Uh, Mr. Higgins.
-Ahh.
-Listen, l'm not quite--
-You don't go ginkgo, do you?
-Ginko?
-Biloba, Gibbons.
You lack
an abundance of energy.
There's a certain overall
malaise about you, Gibbons.
l just think that a smoothie
with a shot of ginkgo in it...
would remedy that.
Well...l prefer coffee.
Well, it's your colon, Gibbons.
I hate to bring this up...
Wha--
Look, this proposal
is due in three days...
and l can't have you
half-hearting it.
-We'll have it done, sir.
-Good!
-[Telephone rings]
-Excuse me.
Kevin Gibbons.
How can l help you?
What up, kid?
Yo, Iook, brother, I am
begging you to reconsider.
No. l'm gonna have
to call you back, OK?
Come on, Kev.
Help us help you!
Man, wouId you stop being
so seIfish for a sec...
and think about the team here?
Gibbons, this campaign
is very important to us.
Your job depends on it.
Do we understand each other?
-All you gotta do is say yes!
-Yes. Yes.
Dude, are--are you sure
that's cool?
-Are you sure?

Yes!
Good.

CONDUC TOR: Next stop, Madison.

-This cannot be happening.
-Done! Thank you.
What is your problem, man?
You gave us the green light.
What? Green light?
What are you talking about?
You said yes on the phone

We could stand here all night

-Shh! Shh!

Yes? Oui, madame.
Vous etes fr ancaise?
Yeah, yeah,

Patch it through now.
Go.
Hello, this is Kevin.
-Hello?
-Hello?
Hello? [Beep]
That sounded like a dude.
-That was strange.
-What?
Why are you reading this?
l don't know.
l thought you'd appreciate
that l'm into your articles.
Look at this.
All these pathetic women
want to meet this guy.
People are lonely.
[Kiss]
Anyway, l think the notion
of someone finding true love...
is--is beautiful!
And l hope she calls him.
What is your obsession
with this guy?
[Sighs]
l'm obsessed?
Well, you do understand...
that the whole notion of love
is merely a myth.
lt was invented by corporations
to turn a profit.
-Love doesn't exist.
-That's romantic.
-Romance doesn't exist.
-l feel sorry for you.
What, you think he's romantic?
That loser's just putting up
posters to meet more girls.
-You're just jealous!
-[Door slams]
lf you like him so much,
why don't you call him?
Sweetie?
[Cell phone rings]
Yo, who dis?
Kevin?
Uh-huh.
That's my name.
Ask me again,
l'm gonna tell you the same.
Hi, it's me--
the girl from the train.
So, you know,
when we hookin' up?
Uh, tomorrow night, l'm free.
Tomorrow? Sunday?
Um, yeah, cool.
How's Cafe de Love?
-7:30?
-Yeah. That sounds good.
Yeah.
l'll be there with bells on.

[Coughs]
[Sniffs]
[Squirt, squirt]
-[Squirt] Oh!
-[Thud]
Well, being that
l'm a pop star, you know...
it's easy to find guys.
lt's just not easy
finding the right guys...
so when l saw your poster,
l knew you'd be different...
you know?
Not the player type.
Has anybody ever told you...
that you have the face
of a de Kooning woman?
l'm pierced in 49 different
places on my body.
ERIC: Enough of this taIk,
aII right?
You and me take a waIk.
Yeah.
Like tonight, we'll head back
to your pad...
where we can get glad.
[Groaning]
Ow!
Wuss.
Mommy.
Ah! You stole my poster!
Hi, Kevin.
Brandi, she's sweet as candy!
Yeah, you the finest sista.
Can l kiss ya?
Fool!
That's the last time...
She's into me.
Hi. l'm Julie.
Hi. l'm...Kevin.

Uh--Oh!
Oh, yeah, babyl
Oh, come on, come to Papa.
Come on, come here.
That's it.
Yeah, I won't bite.
I promise.
That's it. Come here.
Cheers, baby. l'm Kevin.
No, you're not.
Are you saying
l'm not who l say l am?
Yeah. That's exactly
what l'm saying.
Hey, what's the problem?
l knew you sounded different
on the phone.
Hey, wait a second.
Come back here. Come on.
lf you don't like this place,
we can go somewhere else.
Hey, come on! You should
at least try an appetizer!
Look, l'm not him,
you're not her.
What difference does it make?
Come on!
Look,
l don't know who you are...
but if you don't leave me alone
l'll call the cops.
Hey, honey, come here.
What part of
''l'll call the cops''...
didn't you understand?
Like the whole thing.
You're her.
You're the one from the train.
Yeah, you are fine!
Um, uh, Washington,
Lincoln, Donny Reagan...
Martin Sheen,
Mr. Miyagi, BiIIy JoeI...
l'm a friend of Kevin's.
Does he know you're doing this?
Yes. You wouldn't believe
how many ladies have called.
We could start
a booming business!
Wait a second.
That's not a bad idea.
Like--Aw!
Yeah, OK, fine. So, then,
l'll just call you later?
[Snoring]
[Slam]
Uhh!
[Keys jingle]
So?
l don't think it was him.
What do you mean?
l think his friends
are answering the calls...
and taking the girls out.
Yes! l knew it!
Now l can expose him
for the fraud he is!
Heh heh! Kevin Gibbons.
His butt is mine!
[Sighs]
You know what l mean.
[Clack]
What the heck happened to you?

Gibbons,
we need to have a little talk.
Mr. Higgins, the proposal,
it's coming along great.
Oh, yes, about that.
Please.
How can l put this delicately?
Reebok wants you
off the campaign.
What?
Mm-hmm. Yes.
Apparently they read...
that last article about you
in the paper...
you know, about how
you said you wanted to find...
the one girI
so that you couId date...
every desper ate woman
in the Windy City...
which l think was masterful--
masterful, Gibbons.
But Reebok,
they got cold feet...
no pun intended.
How can an article have
anything to do with my work?
Ah! Well, Gibbons,
clients are funny that way.
They said they didn't want
someone on their team...
who would say one thing
and do another.
It's an image thing for them.
But l don't understand.
Gibbons, l'm sick about this,
but my hands are tied.
Sorry.
[Giggles]
You might want to start
practicing with the mail cart.
[Giggles]
So, l take it
it was a fruitful evening?
ERIC: Oh, yeah, dude.
Those little birdies
didn't stand a chance.
l was like,
bam, bam, bam-bam-bam!
Ha ha! [Blows]
You know what I'm sayin'?
How 'bout you?
Well, let's
just say that, uh...
my action cup runneth over.
Ha ha! Action cup!
That's a metaphor, right?
RAND Y: Yeah.
ERIC: Ha hal
That's a good one.
-Oh!
-Hey!
-Good morning.
-How you doing?
Why so crestfallen, young man?
l don't want to talk about it.
At this table,
we kiss and we tell.
Yeah, and then we tell
some more, so come on!
l think l injured my date.
Ha ha! Come on, dude!
Don't be so cocky!
No, l'm serious.
She's jacked up.
-What is she, a car?
-lsn't that a good thing, dude?
No.
-So, what--what's up?
-Yeah?
All right,
l'll tell you what happened.
We're on a date...
-met her at the bar...
-Nice.
Brought her to my apartment.
And all of a sudden
she points to me...
and she says to me,
''l want to hear you play...
one of the songs
that you wrote.''
-Ha ha ha!
-Yeah!
So l thought that was
friggin' great, right?
So l was like, ''Sure!''
So there l am.
So I start jammin'.
I'm jammin'.
I'm singin', I'm goin',
I'm groovin', I'm rockin'...
I'm roIIin'. I'm just goin'
absoIuteIy cr azy.
You know that signature move
when l kick that amp?
RAND Y: Oh, yeahl
That's when it happened.
-Yes!
-Yes!
-What?
-What?
[Playing music]
[Thwack]
ERIC:
Dude, you broke her nose?
-[Crash]
-And her ankle.
-Ha ha ha!
-Ha ha ha!
Yo, she got rocked!
But it's not funny.
Um, so, guys...
have we decided
what we're gonna do...
um, you know, if the real girl
actually calls?
Well, if she hasn't
called by now--
And obviously,
if she does happen to call...
the right thing to do is
close up shop, end of story.
Anything else
would be unconscionable.
l saw her last night.
[Chokes]
-What?
-She was my 7:30.
Have you told Kevin about this?
-Not yet.
-Well, you need to tell him!
Well, yeah, but
what about our operation, man?
l mean...
All right. Fine.
-Today!
-Fine!
Dang it! ldiotic machine!
l swear l will unplug you and
throw you down all flights...
of these stairs
in this buiIding.
-Problems?
-No!
l just have
our biggest clients waiting...
and the machine's
taking a coffee break.
-Where's Nathan?
-Who cares?
l have two minutes
before the Reebok meeting...
and if l don't get
these copies made...
my whole proposal
turns to crud.
OK. All right. l can do this.
Hold on. Let me take a look.
l don't have time for this,
Kevin.
Come on, Lucille.
Don't die on me now.
Listen,
Daddy knows you're tired...
but Daddy knows you got
a few more Ieft in you.
Yes, you do! Yes, you do!
What are you doing?
ls this gonna work?
Sometimes, but if it doesn't...
-[Kick]
-[Machine starts]
[Knocks twice]
Give her a little love tap.
[Sirens and traffic]
[Talking]
Hey!
Hello? lt's me!
Hey!
-You what?
-l saw her.
Where? When?
l mean, you did?
-Yep.
-Well, what happened?
She blew me off.
Oh, man! That is bad!
You know, it doesn't
surprise me, though.
After all the articles
in the paper...
but the thing
I don't understand--
why didn't she call
in the first place?
Kev...
she did call.
What?
Yeah. Um...
we sort of went out on a date.
KEVlN: Wait a minute.
She called, you took her out...
and you didn't tell me?
Well, l--No, l just did.
Whoa, man!
Hey, it's not like l tried...
to kiss her or anything.
Kev, come on!
-Let's talk about thi--
-Uhh!
Ow! Uhh!
Oh! Uhh! Aw!
Kevin, come back here, man!
We're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it
anymore
-You guys--
-What?
Take five.
MUSICIAN: Come on, dude.
SECOND MUSICIAN: I thought
it sounded aII right.
THIRD MUSICIAN: I think
it sounded pretty good.
Listen, Kev, what
we did was inconsiderate...
selfish, stupid, classless.
l mean--
you can stop me anytime.
l mean--
Keep goin'.
l guess we just acted
like jackasses, man.
Just wanted to say l'm sorry.
l appreciate the apology...
but the damage
is already done, so...
Do you know why l wanted
to become a musician?
Hmm. Girls, money, fame.
No. The music, man.
lt's the music.
l mean, when l'm
up there on that stage...
everything is just right
and the world's perfect...
until they start booing me.
You never know who might
listen to your song...
and actually like it.
l guess me dreaming...
and thinking about
writing my songs...
it's kind of like that girl...
that you met on the train,
you know?
You know, you want
something so bad it hurts.
l just admire
your passion, Kev.
You inspired me
to write this...
and, uh...
l figure if you could
put yourself on the line...
to find that girl,
l can do the same.
Write my original song.
Good luck with that.
Cool.

this one up, huh, fellas?
We? What do you mean, we?
lt was your idea.
Hey, come on!
l didn't force you...
to go on
any of those dates, OK?
Yo, listen. Kevin said
that it wasn't a good idea.
[Both argue]
Gentlemen, please.
Guys, come on. Listen to us.
This is stupid.
We're being petty.
We have to step back,
and we have to Iook...
at the bigger picture here,
all right?
We all messed Kevin over.
All right. There's
a bit of truth in that...
but you know what? Now we
gotta make things right, right?
Good!
How are we gonna do that?
l got an idea.
[Crash]
Whoa!
Look. l'm gonna
start right here...
and jump, zip, lock,
l'm gonna ride this.
Now, Randy, l want you

People, we're looking

RAND Y: Yeah, she's the one.

Has anybody seen this girl?
MAN SINGING:

But everywhere you are
Hello. Here you go.
BeautifuI hair, pretty eyes
Do you know her?
Have you seen this girl?

Have you seen this girl?
Anybody seen this girl?
Has anybody seen this woman?
Hello, we need some help here.
This is really important.
We're looking

Heyl Hey, we need your heIp,
peopIel
Hey, has any one of you
ever been in love? Huh?
Has anyone ever met someone
they thought was their destiny?
WeII, my friend
Kevin Gibbons did.
l wasn't there for him then,
but l am here now.
Me and my friends, you know,
we took advantage of Kevin...
and his situation.
-He didn't even know it.
-Yeah.
We went behind his back.
We messed him over.
So come on, people...
take a Iook at this fIier,
pIease.
ERIC: And I Ieave you

Love may not make
the world go 'round...
but it's what makes
the ride worthwhile.
MAN SINGING:

Every time I Iook around
I need you now
Every time I Iook around
I need you now
Every time I Iook around

Hey, Margie,
have you seen Nathan?
Didn't you hear?
He had a heart attack
last night...
right after the Cubbies lost.
Hi, um, l'm looking
for a patient.
-His name is--
-[Crash]
NATHAN: If you think
this food tastes so good...
then you eat itl
Uh, never mind.
So, Eric Young doubles
for an RBl...
in the top of the ninth.
Bottom of the ninth,
Wood ''K''s the side.
Set 'em up, sit 'em down.
You know,
this isn't the first time...
my Cubbies
have put me through this.
Ulcer during the '69 playoffs.
Hypertension
when they lost in '84.
And you should have seen the way
my hemorrhoids flared up...
when they went down in '89.
But that team
also gives me a reason to live.
So, did it ever work out
between you...
and that nice girl
from the train?
l wanted it to, but l don't
think it's gonna happen.
August 29, 1 989.
My beloved Cubs...
were down by nine runs
to the Astros in the sixth...
but did they give up?
No, sir.
They fought tooth and nail,
and they won in extra innings.
l'll never give up
on my Cubbies.
Maybe you shouldn't give up
on that girl, either.
So...
you gonna tell me
what that's all about?
Ernie Banks's dinger.
Caught it the day l met my wife.
l want you to have it.
Thanks, Nathan.
Now, you're not gonna
kiss me, are ya?
Heh!
Go ahead.
Go find that girl.
JACKIE: Reebok signed off
on the account.
That's great.
And l finally got promoted
to senior exec.
Congratulations.
Look, Kevin,
l know l'm a hard case...
but you're just gonna
have to deal with it...
when you design the account.
l'm back on the account?
Reebok needs
your talent and passion...
especially after l told them
that it was your idea.
l knew there was a soft side
in there somewhere.
Maybe, but this is strictly
a business decision.
Sure. l understand.
That's a final copy of the ad.
You may want to take a look
at it before it goes up.
lt's gonna be billboards
all over the city.
Oh, l hope that you find that
girl you've been looking for.
KEVIN: Jackie...
thanks.
Yeah.
