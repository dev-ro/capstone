The incredible legends
of the abominable Dr. Phibes
began a few
short years ago.
All of them,
unfortunately, true.
It was here in London's
fashionable Maldene Square
Whence Phibes
ventured out
To work
his diabolical revenge
Against those responsible
for the death of
his beloved wife Victoria
And the destruction
of his own face,
Making it necessary
to talk
through
an ingenious mechanism
In his neck.
My wife existed
only 6 minutes
on the operating table.
You murdered her.
When the acid reaches him,
he will have a face
like mine.
Oh!
The brilliant minds
of Scotland Yard were baffled
as the murders continued,
each more fiendish
than the last.
And in his soundproof
basement of his mansion,
none could hear
his flamboyant songs
of triumph and revenge
played on his organ and by his
ingenious clockwork musicians.
We have got
to find Phibes.
Only by a stroke
of amazing luck
Did the police seek out
Maldene Square.
But the fiendish Dr. Phibes
Was prepared
for such an emergency,
And building
his face anew,
He entered the crypt
where he had enshrined
his beloved wife--
Incredibly maintained--
Neither alive,
nor completely dead.
And there,
Phibes placed himself
in suspended life,
like her,
until it would be time
For Phibes to rise again.
Gad!
It's as if he disappeared
off the face of the earth.
Phibes
lay in darkness 3 years.
Until the moon, coming into
proper conjunction
with the eternal planets,
shone upon the golden moon
of the crypt,
pulsing with a fantastic
life of its own.
Lifeblood then flowed
back into Phibes.
Great wheels and motors
sprung into motion,
And dr. Phibes once more
walked upon the earth.
Victoria,
For 3 years,
I have rested beside you.
Tonight, the glorious moon
Has risen
to the exact position
Which last occurred
2,000 years ago,
Signaling the opening
of this crypt
And the beginning
of our greatest adventure.
We shall embark
to the land of Egypt,
Where years ago,
in a mountain
overlooking the valley
of the pharaohs,
I did prepare for us
a wondrous shrine,
unknown by any living man.
There, my beloved,
awaits the key
to resurrection for you
and eternal life
for both of us.
And once again,
I call on you,
Vulnavia.
Come one more time,
my trusted aide.
Join me and my beloved,
for we have work to do
to bring her back to life.
Thank you, my dear,
for answering my call.
Upstairs in my safe
is a most precious map
of papyrus--
The way
to a pharaoh's tomb,
beneath which flows,
each 2,000 years,
the River of Life.
We must make haste
and find the river
at its flood.
Let us go upstairs
and prepare
for our journey.
No, no!
While I slept
in sweet oblivion,
Who dared destroy
my house?
The safe.
The safe.
Could it still
be here?
There.
What fiend has taken it?
Only one who seeks
eternal life as I do--
Biederbeck.
The papyrus--
And yet,
paradoxically worthless.
Yes, Ambrose, worthless.
For without my knowledge or my
interpretation of the translation,
It has no value
or significance.
3 years it took me
to come upon
This grand
and final realization.
It was the one...
the one piece I'd searched
for my whole life.
May I, Biederbeck?
Ah.
Ah,
So this is
the papyrus
That I’ve read
so much about.
I've made
no secret of it.
It seems that
when they demolished
An old house
in Maldene Square
It came into the hands
of a dealer
Who contacted me,
Knowing of
My interest.
This seems to be
Almost a matter of
life and death to you.
You're a strange man.
Acclaimed as one of
the most brilliant minds
In the western
Hemisphere,
And yet you seem
obsessed with--
Yes?
With the spiritual, the mythical aspect
of life.
of course
I'm obsessed with life,
And somewhere in Egypt,
that obsession will be answered.
This--
This is all hypothesis.
5 years ago, I toured
the whole area.
Indeed, Ambrose...
And nothing.
I remember looking down
upon the whole valley.
That, my friend,
was your greatest mistake.
You looked down.
did it never occur
to you to look up?
The sky?
Exactly.
That's where
the answer lies--
In the stars,
the moon.
The sky is the key.
While you look down,
I look up.
The rings around Saturn--
When were they discovered?
The beginning
of the 18th century.
Exactly...
And yet,
look here.
See?
Plainly marked,
and that map
is 5,000 years old.
Yes.
And this...
Only a fragment,
but what significance.
It's a page
from the logbook
of a Phoenician
trading ship.
Notice the positioning
of the stars.
A chart far more
sophisticated
Than we allowed
for in our calculations.
And finally,
This--
The temple
of Ibisis.
that's where
We're going.
What do you hope to find?
If there's treasure--
gold, Ambrose-- it's yours.
I'm seeking
something more.
What more do you want?
I like to think
he wants me.
I can tell by your face
you've forgotten.
We're dining
with princess Rica.
I'm sorry.
I'll go up
and change.
Make Ambrose
a drink, will you?
When are you two
going to...
Get married?
You'd better ask
Darius that.
Well, perhaps
after this trip.
You know, sometimes
it's like...
As if he's going
to Egypt for my benefit.
Every day he grows
More preoccupied
With something.
I only wish I knew
What it was.
Oh, Ambrose,
I don't want to go.
I thought
You wanted to go.
Oh, no, darling, I wasn't
talking about tonight.
Don't worry.
Well, are we ready?
Well, here we go, then.
Huh.
Come along, my dear.
Well, at least the meal
should be interesting.
Oh, you'd get
a good claret, anyhow.
Darius, we can't keep
the princess waiting.
Blue blood, you know.
We will return at twelve.
Huh! Huh!
Hah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Huh! Oh!
Hyah!
Hyah!
so, once more,
I have been forced to kill
For you, Victoria.
Only that you may
live again,
For here where
mystic lines converge...
We'll find the door
That separates
the living
From the dead.
I see.
Uh, has he
any known relatives
In this country, sir?
It would seem
most unlikely.
Mmm. Well,
may I ask--
How long has he been
in your employment?
These questions are academic,
Inspector.
- The papyrus--
- That may be--
Don't interrupt me.
It damn well is so.
The papyrus is missing,
And that's all that
I'm concerned about,
Not this prolonged
post mortem.
Now, now, let's just
get our priorities right.
A man has been senselessly killed--
Murdered.
All right, so he has,
But I have been
senselessly robbed.
Curious as that may seem
to your police mentality,
The latter is all that I care about,
do you understand?
Find the papyrus,
and doubtless,
That will lead you
to the killer,
But find the
papyrus first.
You've got 24 hours to
complete your investigation.
This papyrus--
Who exactly would know that
it was in your possession?
Any interested party. I made no secret
of its purchase,
But it would be of interest to
a few international scholars--
All, I assure you,
completely above suspicion.
No, Trout, what you are
looking for is a common thief
who was surprised.
A man who pierces the skull of
another man with a golden snake?
That's not a common thief, sir.
With respect.
With respect?
Just what, then,
are you suggesting?
That it was
a calculated act.
By a man who knows
the true value of the papyrus?
Yes, sir.
No force in
all the world
Can stop us now,
For in a mountain range
Where pharaohs
once reside,
A palace I have built
beneath the stone,
And there we'll wait
Until the great
appointed tide
reveals a secret door
through which we'll find
new life.
and now,
bon voyage to all of us.
With you, Victoria,
safe in
your sealed abode,
we drive to Southampton,
then the channel,
then the open sea.
Come, Vulnavia,
we sail.
Ah, sweet Victoria,
what happy times
of years ago I think of now.
It won't be long,
my love,
Before we've reached
our goal...
And moving, breathing,
you in my arms again
and I in yours.
In Egypt,
I shall find the key--
The key
to the elixir of life.
"June 1st,
at sea, bound for Egypt.
"I’m taking 3 drops
of my elixir of life.
"the vials are almost empty.
"if I fail in Egypt,
I am doomed."
"awaken, o sick one,
"thou hast slept.
"thy have lifted thine head
towards the horizon.
"appear,
"thou art justified
against those
"that sought
to do thee harm."
One of my favorite
passages
From the Book of the Dead...
All relating
to the Divine Incarnation.
Of the phenomenon
of rebirth.
Singularly appropriate,
Ambrose.
Our voyage
has now begun, Vulnavia.
Though brief,
the time aboard this ship
will seem too long,
I know,
So eager are we
to arrive in Egypt
And complete
the preparations
I began
long years ago.
Here...
In the mountain,
Marked on this papyrus,
Beyond corridors,
Which led once to a pharaoh's
hidden tomb,
Awaits the key
to resurrection
and to life.
I shall decipher it.
Nothing...
Nothing will stop me now.
I must tell Victoria,
Hidden safe below
away from curious eyes.
We have but 3 short weeks
Until that glorious day.
How would you pinpoint
the most important part
of the globe?
Rocks erode
and fall.
The sand changes
daily, hourly.
Rivers flood, twist,
form new courses.
Topographically, the world
is in a perpetual flux,
But the sky...
The sky remains
the one constant factor.
What are all these theories
of yours leading up to?
Not my theories alone,
Ambrose.
Ancient civilizations
Knew about this,
Capitalized on it.
To what end?
The return of
the life force, Ambrose.
as I say, they're not my theories.
They're 3,000 years old.
Let me show you another fascinating aspect
of this affair.
where's the model
of the mountain?
In the hold.
Then it can wait.
I'll tell you tomorrow.
Biederbeck,
I won't be able to sleep.
I must know tonight.
I'll go and get it.
Have you discussed this
with anybody else?
Of course not.
And, Ambrose,
I forbid you to tell anyone of
this conversation.
Probably one of these.
Ah.
Let's see now.
Ah, no.
No, that's not it.
Ha, ha!
Not quite the kind
of model i'm looking for.
It might just be
stored in here, sir.
Ha, ha!
Empty,
I suppose.
Pity.
Ah, that looks
more like it.
Yes. Well, thank you
very much, officer.
I mustn't keep you
from your duties.
I could
quite easily just--
Oh, I can manage
by myself.
Well,
As you say, sir.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night to you, sir.
What the hell?
Come in.
Mr. Biederbeck?
Yes, captain.
I am sorry to be
the bearer of bad news.
I have made 2 sweeps
of the area
And found no trace
of your friend.
Very well, then.
That's that.
I'm afraid that we must
face up to the fact that...
Well, time is running out,
Mr. Biederbeck.
And no doubt you'll resume
your normal course.
Oh, god.
Heavens, no.
Naturally, I intend
to use my every power
To find him.
We shall continue to search
until dawn if necessary.
But you said yourself
there's no hope.
It's been 2 hours.
This delay
is intolerable.
Please bring your ship
around, captain.
I would remind you, Sir,
That the navigation
of this ship
Is my responsibility.
I shall, of course,
bear your suggestion in mind.
Was he a good swimmer?
I have no idea, captain.
I suppose he never...
How can I put this?
I suppose he never
touched the bottle.
then how the hell did he get
in there in the first place?
the blighter
must've drunk his way in.
I come back
from leave,
And the first thing I find
on my desk is this!
Oh? What's that,
Then, sir?
"the Gloucester
Squirt murder.
"the Gloucester
Square murder."
I can hardly read
your writing, for a start.
"on arrival, I discovered
the man's body surrounded by..."
Balls.
Look here, Trout...
On the snooker
table, sir.
What?
Oh.
"balls on
the snooker table."
"cause of death was apparently
By a small gold...
"snake
"which entered the man's left
Ear at great speed,
"and having pierced the skull,
reappeared through the right."
In one ear and
out the other, sir.
"Death, it would appear,
was instantaneous."
Oh, brilliant.
Why was his employer,
the principal witness,
allowed to leave
the country?
It was
a delicate matter,
And I was dealing
with a difficult man.
You're dealing with an even
more difficult one.
Do you know
what time it is?
Uh, it's just after
1:00, sir.
I've been waiting for you
since 9:00.
I was called out
last night, sir.
Where?
What was it called?
uh, Forley.
Never heard of it.
It's in the mouth of
Southampton water, sir.
A man's body had
been washed up.
Fallen overboard?
In a sense, yes.
Men fall overboard
frequently.
That's what
the locals are for.
That's what I complain
about here!
This one was inside
a bottle.
He what?
He was inside a bottle.
Glass, it was,
About 7 feet long.
Corked?
To Egypt and our
arrival here.
My compliments
to you,
Vulnavia.
You have done wonders
with the local fish.
But we must not dally.
While Victoria
safely sleeps,
We must hasten
to the caves within
And learn what time has wrought
since last I ventured there.
See, Vulnavia.
Not a thing
has been disturbed.
Some minor decorating,
some touching up,
And it will seem
like home.
Lights!
Music,
Vulnavia!
A song of
celebration.
Unveil the band.
We're looking
for a madman.
Well, you've bloody well
found one.
Do you realize that this
is Saturday afternoon?
We'd have a little talk
with you in private,
As you're
the shipping agent.
We appreciate
you coming along
at such short
notice, mr...
Lombardo, and I didn't have
much option, did I,
With a ruddy police car
rolling up outside my club?
Frightful intrusion.
And, as I say,
on a Saturday afternoon.
Well, it is a rather
delicate matter, sir.
Hmm?
We've, um...
We've found the body.
Well, I didn't know
you mislaid one. Whose?
Ambrose's.
The man who
fell off the...
Ah, him.
Yes, sir.
If it's about
insurance,
It's much too early
for me to commit.
Well, it seemed pretty obvious
that he was, uh, pissed.
We are loath--
I beg your pardon.
Loath to involve anybody
else at this juncture.
But we have a strong reason
to believe that he was murdered.
Murdered?
Killed.
Yeah, I got that.
Shoved the old boy
off, eh?
Did you know
the gentleman?
Not intimately, but I
knew him professionally.
He was always going on cruises
to the Middle East.
He was an archaeologist,
Digging around
in the dirt.
Like you chaps.
Right.
This may seem a rather
obvious question,
But on this
passenger list,
Was there anyone you would
describe as at all--
How shall I
put it-- odd?
The whole ruddy lot of them. No.
That's a slight exaggeration.
No. I wouldn't say
exceptionally odd.
Oddish.
Well...
Is that it?
For the time being.
Thank you.
If you should have
second thoughts
about the smallest thing,
We'd like
to hear from you.
You can rely on me.
I'll think about it.
We do have a lot of
eccentric people,
as I’ve said,
on these tours.
It takes all sorts,
doesn't it?
I must tell you,
there was a woman--
Oh, well, tell the story
another time.
Whatever they ask for,
we try to keep them happy.
We get chaps wanting pianos
in their suites.
It helps the whole
thing along.
Moonlight sonata
And all that.
Yes. We are grateful to you
for coming along.
On this last trip, a fellow wanted
an organ.
Well, I’ll be off.
Would you say
that again, sir?
Well, I’ll be off.
No, no, no.
Before that.
The organ,
you mean?
Yes, yes.
I don't think. He was probably
an organist.
I remember
the girl stipulated
that it be
a cinema organ.
Girl?
The girl who did
the booking.
Was her employer's
name Phibes?
Phibes?
No, Smith.
We get
a lot of Smiths.
Smith.
Thank god for that.
Thank you again,
Mr. Lombardo.
This girl who did--
Don't waste his time!
We've got jobs to do.
Did you see the man at all?
No, I didn't see
the man.
Only the girl.
She was a very beautiful girl,
Very tall.
You'd have
liked her.
There was something
strange about her.
I suppose she was
probably an entertainer.
Of course.
There's the answer.
Fellow's on the boards.
Wanted a bit of practice.
Anything else
with him?
Organ music. Bound to go
down well with those Arabs.
Clockwork
musicians.
Life-size clockwork
musicians.
That isn't
all they took.
I've got all the details
over at my office.
I'd like to come along
and take a glance.
You didn't see
the man?
No, I didn't see
the man.
I saw the girl.
She did the whole lot.
She did the paying--
Did she pay
by check?
No, no, no.
Cash.
Return fare?
No. Single.
Single?
One-way?
Maybe he won't
come back.
Oh, it's Phibes
all right, sir,
And he always
comes back.
You know
the saying, Trout.
Build a better
mousetrap,
and the world will beat
a path to your door.
Every time we've built
a better mousetrap
Phibes has built
a better mouse.
What the hell
is that?
Nothing to do
with me, sir.
Are you sure it's
not one of your...
What do you mean,
one of mine?
Oh.
Very sorry. I must've
dropped right off.
May we ask
why you're here?
I've come to see
Mr. Waverley.
Would you like
me to go, sir?
I'm Waverley.
Oh, isn't that nice?
Such a sweet man
showed me in.
I'm an Ambrose,
you know.
Ambrose?
You're--
Cousin of the late Harry.
We were very sorry
about that.
It--it must've been
a great shock.
Not all that close,
I'm afraid.
We kept in touch
occasionally.
I thought he was
a mysterious old bird.
Can you tell us anything
that might be of any help,
Miss, uh...
Ambrose.
Did anybody bear him
a grudge or anything?
Well, it's hardly likely,
is it?
I mean, he spent most of his
time leaping round the world.
It's possible,
I suppose, though.
Hmm.
Just before you came in,
I took the liberty
Of looking at this map.
That's not where they're
going at all, you know.
Who?
Biederbeck and that lot.
Now...
Here.
This is much more likely.
Where is everybody?
Mr. Biederbeck,
I'm Hackett.
I imagine
The others
Will be--
The instructions were
for everyone to wait
until I arrived
at the base camp--
Hmm.
Well?
Uh, Stewart and Baker
couldn't wait.
They've gone off to explore
the mountain.
They've gone off
to do what?
They were
getting impatient.
And Shavers?
Oh, he's around.
Hackett.
Well, come on.
Come on where?
I'm sorry, stay here
and rest.
Damn it, Hackett, no man should go
near that mountain alone.
Nobody really knows
what's in there.
Sleep on,
my sweet Victoria,
For regal claws
of sacred birds
Guard well
your place of rest.
For those poor fools
that dare intrude,
the penalty
is death.
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah! Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Did you have
a good dinner?
Do you realize
what this is?
A secret room,
hidden from view,
so long as
it is flooded,
but now as the moon rises
towards a zenith,
the waters
have receded,
And they flow
underground,
Perhaps into the hidden
river of life itself.
Somewhere through
there, Vulnavia,
awaits our answer.
What pharaoh
of what forgotten dynasty
rested here
before he drifted
on the bosom of what stream
beneath these stones
to find eternal life?
A secret compartment
beneath the sarcophagus
large enough to hold
Victoria.
What other secrets
lie within?
A key--
An actual key.
How ironic
and how clever.
When I find the lock
it fits,
I'll have the answer.
Shavers, Baker,
where are you?
Straight ahead,
Biederbeck.
What do you think
you're doing?
Oh...
Well, it's just
a preliminary sortie, sir.
On whose authority?
We didn't realize
we needed permission.
When you're older
and more experienced,
Maybe you'll learn to have
respect for authority.
You might want to remember
that you're a member of my team,
Working for me.
Is this
your mountain, sir?
I regard it as such, yes.
Are we to take that
literally, sir?
Take it
however you wish,
but understand that
I give the orders.
Any explorations will be
Planned and led by me.
Understood?
Fine, Biederbeck,
but, you know, we're not
exactly amateurs here.
If discoveries
are to be made,
It'll require
individual effort
and a certain amount
of intellectual freedom.
Hackett, there are
no prima donnas here.
Discoveries will be made by
the team, under my directions.
Well, then, perhaps you'll be so kind
as to enlighten us.
Just where is all this
leading to?
In good time.
Not now, Diana.
It's usual for all information
to be pooled, sir.
I have no doubts--
It's rather urgent.
What is it, Diana?
I have a little
discovery of my own
that I think
you ought to see.
You mustn't let
this upset you.
Upset me?
A man has just been killed.
We're
in the desert,
Not taking tea
in Mayfair.
Curious as it
may seem,
You don't have
to remind me of that.
I've drunk lots of
tea in Mayfair
Without finding dead
bodies at my feet.
Would you just
trust me?
Trust?
Yes, trust.
How far is that
going to get me or us?
How can I?
You don't trust me.
What's that
supposed to mean?
It's not supposed
to mean anything.
It seems clear. You don't trust me,
and you won't tell me.
Your attitude
has changed.
Suddenly, human life means
nothing to you anymore.
Have I said that?
No, but I just have.
You're so
callous now.
Is that what
you really think?
Do you honestly care what
I really think? Do you?
Of course I do.
It's just that I--
- What is it?
- I can'texplain it.
What's holding
you back?
I mean, it's that,
isn't it?
Why does that big mountain
have so much hold
over you?
I mean, just what is it
that goes on in there?
How lovely she looks,
my darling,
on her way to her last
brief sleep before awakening.
She shall rest
where none can find her.
I am protecting you,
Victoria,
from those
who would discover us.
I shall eliminate them all,
one by one.
Yes...
Even Biederbeck himself
If need be, my beloved.
In this secret compartment
made by artisans
millenniums ago,
You shall rest like
the princess you are.
For when the moon
next comes full,
The waters of the Nile
and the tides
within the seas
will somehow meet,
And life will flow
within your veins
and love within our hearts.
Uh, we've got enough trouble
around here
without you
dreaming up more.
That kind of trouble
I can take anytime.
Yes, well...
She belongs
to Biederbeck.
Damn you.
Yes, for some
more than others.
Since you have nothing
better to do this evening,
Maybe you'll unload
the other truck.
Uh, what--
What truck?
Hackett's truck.
Get a good night's
sleep.
You still haven't told me
what you expect to find.
Tomorrow.
Now, Darius.
I'd like to know now.
Tomorrow.
Ah!
What the hell's going on?
You're mad!
You're bloody mad!
For god's sake, man!
"if music be
the food of love...
"play on."
ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Give me excess a bit.
No.
Here, with a loaf of
bread beneath the bar,
A book of verse,
A glass of beer...
That's--that's
Omar Khayya'm, sir.
Yes.
You know, I'm
a bit apprehensive
about finding
the others, sir.
Do you think you
know where we are?
Trout, I don't think,
I know.
I don't think
you know, either.
Keep your place,
Trout.
Sorry, sir.
Now then...
Cairo is, um...
Over there.
And by the same token,
the Red Sea is over there.
And that direction,
Trout...
Yes?
England.
Yeah. Yeah,
quite so, sir,
But how do we find
this mountain range
Where Biederbeck and
Phibes are going?
There are times, Trout,
when I worry about you.
All we have to do
is to ask someone.
Out here, sir?
Why not?
Bound to be somebody.
Ah, there!
There's somebody!
Where, sir?
Um, 3 dunes east.
Hop to it, man!
Start the tank!
Hackett, I need you!
What's this about?
Why are we taking the truck?
I've sent Baker and
the arab workmen up there.
Why are we taking
the truck?
We broke through
a wall.
Found a gold sarcophagus.
Already, underground
waters have begun to rise.
Somewhere within
this maze of tunnels
a new river will crest,
along which we will glide,
through gates,
which will be revealed
to us, Vulnavia.
The gates which
can be unlocked
only with
the silver key.
Come. I must
tell Victoria.
Those devils!
To take from me
the two treasures of my life!
I shall get them back!
Who tries to stop me
will die!
It certainly is
a remarkable find.
How he knew it was
there beats me.
He went straight
to it.
I think it calls
for a celebration.
Um, champagne?
Yes!
Shall I pour
some for Darius?
Yes, I think so.
A key.
Why a key?
Oh, I don't know.
Something's biting him.
Who is this, then?
Darius.
Stewart's back.
Don't let him
go away.
I'll be out
in a moment.
He's not going
anywhere.
Please, you
must come now.
I suppose
we'd better take him down.
Why?
I don't understand.
Whose mind could conceive of
such a bizarre way to kill?
A man called
Phibes, sir.
Dr. Anton Phibes.
They have taken you
from me, my sweet Victoria,
But fear not,
for I shall recover you,
And they will suffer
for this outrage
with their lives!
So, with Stewart, he's now
killed 4 men.
Recently, sir.
If you go further back--
Trout.
Yes, but why? What possible reason
could he have?
Well, Biederbeck?
The papyrus.
If he stole it, it means we have
the same goal,
The same
purpose.
Oh, that's impossible.
Impossible?
Impossible or not,
we must all get back to
civilization at once.
yeah, especially
the young lady.
Yes, I'm afraid
you're right.
Baker, first thing
tomorrow,
I want you to take
Diana out of here.
The rest can
follow later.
And your good self, Sir?
There's one thing more
I must do before I leave.
If you value your life--
That's precisely
why I'm staying.
Remarkable man.
I hardly know him,
But I've never met anyone
more completely dedicated.
That poor girl...
What she must've gone through
in the past few days.
Why the hell did
he bring her out?
Curiously enough,
Waverley,
I think she's the reason
he came in the first place.
Listen--
I'm listening.
You're my whole life.
Everything.
Please, darling,
if nothing else,
you must know that.
I'm beginning to wonder if
I know anything about you.
I can't tell you
any more.
Not that
you'd understand.
The mountain must be
the key to it all, sir.
Possibly, Trout,
but it's all purely academic.
We only got as far as
an inner chamber,
But it looked
as though
There's a maze of tunnels
under that mountain.
Every move I make,
everything.
This whole affair concerns
our future together.
Well, if it's
anything like now,
It's going to be
pretty awful.
It won't be.
I promise you.
It's just that...
What? What were you
going to say?
Say it.
It's just these
next few hours
Are of desperate
importance to me.
This expedition isn't
really the reason
we came out here, is it?
I mean, there's
something else.
We could search
the mountain.
Search it?
One needs a warrant
to make a search.
You should
know that.
Yes, sir, but
in this place--
You can't charge into
somebody else's  mountain.
This isn't
Hyde Park.
Baker.
I want you to sleep
in the sarcophagus tonight.
Be sure you're packed
and ready to leave
in the morning
with Diana.
Ha. What is it
Shakespeare says?
"thus unconscious
doth make
"strange bedfellows
of us all."
Don't worry, Trout.
You know what
I'm dying for?
What, sir?
A nice, big,
Warm...
What?
Glass of milk.
Would you like me
to go and get one?
No, that's
all right, Trout.
Dear girl,
man the machine.
What's going on?
Oh! Ouch!
Ah!
Ah!
Let me out!
Ah!
At least we're sure
of one thing.
Hmm?
Nothing much can happen
on a night like this.
Yeah.
Ah!
Victoria...
Those who have tried
to take you from me
So have they paid
the terrible price.
This water, placid now,
is but a calm deception,
for beneath this mountain
when moon and water
reconcile
the secret river of life
Will be revealed.
The key!
Where is the key?
What's the matter?
Where's Baker?
Baker.
Poor Devil.
Quite.
He's taken
the sarcophagus.
But I still
have the key.
That storm
last night...
Phibes must have
used that as cover.
Used it? He probably
summoned it.
The arabs are gone.
I don't blame them!
It's the obvious
thing to do!
I found the truck abandoned
up by the mountain.
And the sarcophagus?
Well, that's gone.
Just as I expected.
But what were
they doing there?
Who drove the truck up there
in the first place?
Where's Baker?
He had a bad night, sir.
Come along, Biederbeck.
I'm still staying.
Now look here, sir.
I have a responsibility.
I appreciate you
have a moral responsibility,
But as far as I am concerned,
no actual jurisdiction.
I am staying here!
No one's ever got
the better of Phibes.
To our certain
knowledge,
He's already
killed 15 men!
You can't hope
to win!
Don't speak of hope
to me, Trout.
I mean to win.
Hackett, with Baker gone, you'll have
to take Diana out of here.
If you'll excuse me,
I'd like a word with her.
Darling, would you
come with me?
Hackett, put her suitcase
in the truck.
Come along, Trout.
Strike camp.
We ought to get
these tents down, too,
and be on our way.
What about Baker?
Should we dispose
of his body?
Don't know
about his body,
But I think we should
bury his head.
Listen.
It's the Scottish
Fusiliers!
My god. It makes you
proud to be British.
Out here?
How marvelous.
It's probably
some desert patrol.
Britannia's cloak
covers a large
section of the globe.
We must tell them
about the others.
I mean, that way
they'll be safe.
Yes, that's
true enough.
But I mustn't
leave you.
Oh, I'll go with you,
Mr. Hackett.
What?
Uh, no. No,
But you're absolutely right.
A platoon
of that lot
will put Phibes
in his place.
Uh, don't go anywhere.
Ah!
Hackett.
He has nothing
to say, sir.
Where's Diana?
My god,
Phibes must have her!
you haven't
got a chance!
He'll chop you down
like the others
I'm not like
the rest of them!
Phibes may put the fear
of god in you, but not me!
Now, stay out
of my way!
oh, dear,
dear, dear.
He really is being
a trifle heavy-handed.
He's being
bloody offensive!
If it wasn't for
miss Trowbridge in there--
Come on!
Biederbeck! Wait!
After him.
Yes, sir.
Phibes!
So we meet at last,
Biederbeck.
Where is she?
Waiting...
As we all
must wait.
Don't play your foul games
with me, Phibes.
If ever a man deserves
to die, it's you.
You cannot threaten the dead
with death, my friend,
Only with life.
Eternal Life.
So that's it.
The key.
My key.
No. I've searched
for years.
The temple of Ibisis,
the river of life...
It's mine, Phibes.
Then your beloved will die,
For only the key
can save her now.
You lie.
The key controls the gates,
nothing more.
The key controls
the gates and much more!
The life of your Diana
And you have only
3 minutes to use it.
Now...
Save your Diana.
Diana!
Diana!
Observe,
my sweet Victoria,
That as the sacred
waters drain away,
the final revelation
is before us...
The gates to eternity.
Go, Vulnavia,
And let our victim know
the full measure
of our wrath.
What an amazing thing.
Don't do that, Trout.
Sir?
The fellow's toenail.
What we really need,
sir, is a ram.
Yes.
You have so little time,
Biederbeck.
What kind of fiend
are you?
The kind that wins,
my friend.
It is a pity, in a way.
We have so much
in common.
You flatter yourself.
I think not.
For years, I have had
one terrible obsession...
To find the river of life
once used by the
pharaohs of Egypt.
It lies beyond
those gates.
A river
that gives new life...
Again and again and again!
Why do you think
I came here?
You have all the life
you need.
No more, Phibes.
The elixir that gave me youth
for 100 years is gone.
This vial has sustained
me for many years.
Suspended time and age,
but no more!
How long?
How many years?
Too long
to remember.
Too long to throw it
all away now!
I, too, have searched,
Biederbeck,
But not for myself.
For my Victoria.
I offer you the same goal--
The life of your beloved.
But hurry!
When the bough breaks,
my friend...
It could be a trick.
Why should I trust
you of all people?
Not me.
The ancient artisans
who built these chambers.
When those gates
are unlocked,
the waters from Diana's pool
will drain out
and she will be free.
Save her. Don't be a fool.
Soon it will be too late!
For whom?
For us all...
Especially Diana!
Every second brings her closer
to a terrible death.
Can you pay that price,
Biederbeck?
The key!
The devil take you,
Phibes.
The devil take me?
Not for some 
considerable time, I trust.
Now, if Biederbeck
went through there,
And he was running
pretty fast--
I'll be blowed.
And then...
Wait a minute.
Phibes must be out first.
Otherwise,
we would have...
Yes, I think--
I think I've got it.
Don't worry.
We'll get her out.
Phibes has finally failed, eh?
No. He's won.
Come on, Trout.
Come, Vulnavia.
Your work is done.
Join us on the other side.
What's that?
Nothing.
Phibes! Wait!
Phibes!
Phibes!
Phibes, I beg you!
Let me come with you!
Phibes, for once have mercy!
Don't worry, darling.
It's not the end of the world.
# Somewhere over the rainbow
# bluebirds fly
# birds fly over the rainbow
# why, then, oh, why can't I?
