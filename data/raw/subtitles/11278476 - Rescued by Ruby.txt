Ruby!
Hot dog!
Ruby, come get it.
Hot dog!
Oh! Good girl! Good girl.
Good girl. Oh, Ruby!
Oh!
And you have a date with a family.
Oh!
Somewhere in you is an adoptable dog.
I know. I know.
All right. Good girl. Come on.
Oh my gosh! We've got skunk soap.
Perfect. Thank you. Come on, Ruby.
- She knows a family's picking her up.
- She doesn't want to leave us.
No, no, no, she doesn't want to leave you.
Well, I'd take her home,
but my husband would leave me.
All right, come on.
This is serious now.
You've been here six months. Yeah.
You cannot blow this chance.
You've been to seven homes already.
Darn dog!
Ruby!
Get out of there, Ruby!
Ruby!
It's time to clean up your act, sweetie.
All right? Come on, stinky.
Let's get you going.
Ah!
Come on!
Let's hope this placement sticks.
All right.
- Oh, I washed that.
- I just picked a piece of onion off it.
Oh.
Yum, yum, yum.
Come sit with us. I don't even let
my third graders eat while standing.
I failed third grade. And fourth.
- You're exaggerating.
- Oh, you'd have failed me.
Never. You would be my favorite.
Teacher's pet.
Bye.
Careful today.
Always.
- Say "Bye, Dada."
- Bye-bye, Dada.
That boat's
in a good spot there.
All right now. That's clear.
- Head down current there.
- Let's go. Seek!
Morning.
Morning.
- It's the K9 unit.
- Yeah.
Searching for drugs
tossed out of a vehicle last night.
That's some of Matt Zarella's team
down there. Best of the best.
Like a Navy SEAL Special Ops team.
300 million olfactory receptors
in their noses,
compared to six million in people.
Their sense of smell's
100,000 times more acute than ours.
If we can sense a teaspoon of sugar
in a cup of coffee,
a dog can detect a teaspoon of sugar...
In two Olympic-size pools
filled with water.
Yeah.
Uh, Daniel O'Neil. Rhode Island
state trooper, Wickford Barracks.
Seamus Brady.
Retired maintenance, Scituate Barracks.
- Well, it's good to meet you.
- Mm.
Look. Found.
Bring it in.
Smooth. Good job!
Excellent work.
I'm gonna be one of those guys
with one of those dogs.
I gotta, uh... Good to meet you, Mr. Brady.
Bring it in. Let's go, team.
Weather continues to be unseasonably warm.
Not even May, but keep an eye out
for stranded motorists,
carry extra water
for overheating radiators.
No matter the heat, hats stay on.
I'm talking to you, Two Towers.
- You got it, Sarge.
- You got it, Sarge.
And of special interest to O'Neil.
It's that time of year.
Tryouts for the K9 academy
are coming up May 15.
Right on, my brother.
Eighth time trying to get in
is gonna be the charm.
Be safe, everyone.
Sarge. Uh, this year's my last chance.
The applicants have to be under 30,
and I'm 29.
I'll write the letter of rec again,
but I'm not the one
standing in the way of you trying out.
It's Zarella. His K9 unit, his academy.
Come on.
Come on. She'll come.
Come on, Ruby.
Okay, go on. Go. Go on, sweetie.
Go on. Go.
There you go.
That's nice, right? There you go.
- Oh.
- Aw. She got away.
Oh! Okay, okay, okay. Okay!
Go on. Go on.
Go!
Go on.
Good.
Ah, there you go.
Come.
There you go.
That's nice, right? There you go.
I don't wanna see her back here.
I'll have no choice.
Thanks.
Excuse me, sir. How many juice boxes
have you had this afternoon?
All right.
License and registration, please.
Mom!
Hey, I was... I was just kidding.
Sir, I know you think
I don't have the right stuff to...
No. The right temperament.
No, no, no, no. Don't presume
to know what he knows or thinks.
Daniel O'Neil.
Like clockwork.
Sir.
All right, sit down.
Sir, I know you think
I don't have the right temperament,
that I'm easily distracted,
maybe not much of a reader,
but for the job I think intuitive skills
and people skills are more important
than being speedy with paperwork.
Plus, I love dogs.
I'm ready for this.
I'd really like to try out, sir.
Aren't you qualified
in a bunch of other trooper specialties?
Yes, sir. I am.
Hostage negotiating, EVOC training,
peer-to-peer counseling,
honor guard, boat team, dive team.
But K9 is my dream. You know that, sir.
I mean, I think you know that, sir.
Sorry, sir. I don't mean to presume
to know what you know or think.
- I'm a fan.
- Thanks.
But also a truth-teller.
K9 team requires calm
and focus.
You're all over the place.
You can't even sit still.
- Who knows where your mind is.
- It's here, sir.
I appreciate the candor
and the persistence, but I don't see it.
You do this
because you care about people, sir.
The same as me.
You want justice.
You want endings to stories.
Sometimes happy endings.
Sometimes just closure.
The department has no money for new dogs.
The German shepherds we use
come from Czech Republic or Germany
and cost over $10,000 each.
I know how much you want this.
How long you've waited.
I'm a short guy.
I barely made the height requirement.
I had to work twice as hard
to get to the same place as everyone else.
I'm used to working ten times harder.
Sir.
Danny.
Catch.
We don't have $10,000.
With one kid here and another on the way,
we have our hands full.
- Say what you just said again.
- I'm pregnant.
That's great news!
That's great!
Oh, Mel! Oh.
Ma?
K9 dogs live with their officer partners
24/7, right?
It's no trouble at all. They're trained.
You wouldn't have to lift a finger.
I'm thinking now maybe
it's not the right time for the K9 thing.
Remember how we were building the deck
when I was carrying Finn,
and you promised a quiet pregnancy
if it happened again?
It's... It's not the right time for K9 unit.
It's the only time, Mel.
It's a... It's a step up, a raise.
We'll finally be able
to pay off college loans,
save for our kids,
maybe get a bigger house someday.
- So what's the plan?
- I'll get back to you.
- All right. Love you.
- I love you too.
Hey. Down. Down.
She doesn't listen. She's too high-strung.
She chews. She digs. She steals food.
She never sleeps. She barked all night.
She's not even housebroken.
I know people who train dogs.
I could get you some names.
- I'll pay for it.
- We're not keeping her.
Maybe you have a kitten?
That dog looks like Ruby, right?
But it's not. It's a new dog.
She's had so many chances.
We can't keep unadoptable dogs.
- She'll be put down tonight.
- Rick, no.
Ruby's never had a real home.
She thinks this is home. We are her home.
When somebody takes her,
she thinks she's just visiting,
like going to the vet
and we're gonna pick her up.
You know how these dogs are.
Their family drops them off here,
and day after day they just wait,
expecting their person
to come and get them.
They'll wait and wait.
Sometimes they wait a very long time.
It's heartbreaking.
Ruby just knows how to get back home.
It can take a while before someone
as loyal and loving as a dog
can commit to someone new.
Nobody's given Ruby that chance.
- Pat, come on.
- One more day.
I've got people I can call. Please.
You have until the end of the day.
But the vet comes at seven.
No, I wish we could
help you. We can't take any more dogs.
Thank you.
I just thought I'd give you another try.
Sorry.
Hi, honey.
Whoa. Can you just
take Moonlight, please? Thank you.
You can't do this to me. No.
No. We got four kids.
And a rescue for each one.
Plus George, and Billie,
and Barney, and Moonlight.
- You're killing me.
- Okay.
All right, here we go.
All teams, these three.
- Up!
- Good.
Hey.
Hey. Pull up a stool.
What? All right.
Lot better than sitting home watching TV.
- A beer?
- Root beer.
Finest sarsaparilla
with notes of ginger and clove.
Yeah.
Uh, you wouldn't know anyone with
a German shepherd to give away, would you?
Nope.
I, uh, I need one
to try out for the K9 unit.
Don't tell Zarella you heard this from me,
but you don't need a German shepherd.
Not technically.
I've seen it before, up in Mass.
See, what you're needing
is a young, good-sized dog
who's curious,
and agile, and has spirit.
And costs nothing.
Shoot.
Hi. Um...
I'm looking for a German shepherd.
You lost one, or are you hoping to adopt?
Um, adopt. Adopt. Sorry.
Contact info here.
Oh.
Um, okay.
Uh...
We don't get many purebreds.
Could be a year or more.
Um...
All right. Know what?
Thank you. I'm sorry, but...
We got a lot of great dogs.
I mean, let me take you out back.
Take a look. You never know.
Yeah, all right. Thank you.
No name tag?
Oh, yeah. That's so weird.
- This one just gets to me.
- How old?
A little more than a year.
- Smart?
- Half Border collie.
There's one named Chaser on YouTube
that knows the names of 1,000 objects.
- You think he could be a K9 dog?
- She could be anything.
I know, I know.
Come here. Fetch it. Fetch it.
Ruby, right here. Fetch it.
Bring it to me.
Ruby. Ruby. Ruby.
Come here! Come here! Come here!
Bring it to me.
Bring it here. Bring it here.
Good girl. Come here. Bring it to me.
Good girl. All right, ready?
Ruby. Ready? Good girl. I know. I know.
You ready? Come on, come on, come on.
Come on.
Oh, Ruby. Ruby. Ruby!
Come here.
Come here, Ruby. Bring it to me.
Here. Here. Good girl.
Thank you. Thank you.
Good girl. Thank you.
She's special.
So, are there forms to fill out?
Or... how does this work?
So she's fixed.
She's had her shots.
Anything else you'd like
to ask about her? Like, her history?
Uh...
I think, uh, you know,
what I see is what I get.
She was a street dog.
Used to scrapping to survive.
All right. Cool.
She's gonna be the first shelter dog
to make the K9 unit.
Um...
Okay.
She's a handful.
Uh, you know, I like a challenge.
- That's for you.
- Thank you kindly.
Know what? This is for you.
Oh! Thanks.
- Some food here.
- Okay. Thank you.
There's goodness in you, okay?
Don't be afraid to let it show.
Here we go.
- Oh. Wow! Okay...
- Yep.
- Anything else?
- Nope, that's it.
I'm just kidding. All right.
- All right.
- All right.
Thank you. Have a good one.
- Thank you.
- Get the door for you.
- There you go. All right.
- Hold on.
- See ya.
- Shall we go home? Yeah, come on.
- She's going with him. That's a good sign.
- Yeah, it's good.
I'd fall apart if I got
that attached to every animal here.
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.
All right, Ruby. You ready?
All right. Hold on.
- Hi.
- A dog.
- Yeah.
- Oh, wow.
You wanted to know the plan.
This is the plan.
Hey, no!
Ruby?
Ruby, hey.
Ruby, no.
Okay, Ruby. No. Out... Outside.
Uh-uh. Outside.
I'm sorry, honey.
Has Zarella ever taken
a shelter dog in the K9 unit?
Not yet, no.
Ruby, come on. Come on. Hey!
All right. Come on. Come on.
Ah! Ruby did that.
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh no, honey. No. Not near there.
Yeah, we're gonna be
doing this for a while, aren't we?
Yeah, Dad's tired, so...
Where you going, bud?
- Where you going?
- Read the book.
You want... The book's right here.
Different book? You need
to pick a different book? All right.
Hey, Ruby. Ah!
All right, just... just hold that. Hang on.
Okay, Ruby, come on. Good girl.
- Wait. No.
- No, no, no. No!
No!
- Hey! No, no, no, no, no.
- Ruby. Ruby.
Ruby.
Hey! Come here. No. Yeah.
- Scoot. Yeah. Good girl.
- What are you doing?
She's like a foster kid.
She needs structure and stability.
You read this?
- Skimmed it, yeah.
- Uh-huh.
I'm so happy about the baby.
Me too. But not about the dog.
Look, she's clever.
She has raw talent.
No! Off! Get off!
Ruby. Yeah, okay. All right.
Come on. Come on.
- I just need to bond with her.
- I know. Maybe just bond out there.
Yeah, all right.
Yeah. Ruby.
Come on. Come on.
Yeah. Hold on.
Come on. No.
- Off, off, off!
- I'm sorry, Mel.
Come on, Ruby. Please. Come on, let's go.
Yeah.
Okay, Ruby. Your water.
Okay.
Come on.
All right.
She'll come around, all right?
She'll come around.
He's sleeping with her?
Hey, O'Neil! Tell your dog to shut up.
Happy Saturday.
Your wife's gonna love that.
Hi. Morning...
He's lost his monkey.
It's probably out there somewhere.
Monks.
Wow.
The last 18.5 hours
have felt like an eternity.
Mm.
Mel.
That's amazing. Mel!
Honey, I... I can't. It's too much.
No, yeah, I'm gonna take her
to an obedience class this morning.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
Yeah. I just need to, um,
find one and sign her up.
Perfect. Perfect.
Keep them close.
Stop.
Wonderful.
- Okay.
- All right, come on.
Come on. We're going to the library first.
We're going to the library.
Oh boy.
Sorry. I'm late.
Come in. Come in.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Sorry!
Your dog is aggressive.
It needs socialization.
Yeah.
She doesn't need a class.
She needs medication.
Ruby! Sorry! Sorry!
Jeez. Unbelievable!
Ruby. Ruby.
Hey. You see those dogs out there?
Ruby, you see those dogs out there?
That could be you.
I thought you'd be grateful
to have a family, a great job.
Purpose in life.
Excellent. Go ahead and reward him.
I thought I was good with animals.
I thought we had a connection.
Getting out? You gonna join me?
Uh...
No, we're, uh...
We're heading back to the shelter.
She's impossible.
You know, she doesn't listen.
She destroys everything.
You're giving up on her.
Uh...
Who's gonna believe in her if you don't?
Who believes in you?
I've been lucky that way.
Well, maybe that dog
deserves some of your luck.
If you'll try,
I'll give you my all.
Ruby, you see this basket?
All my eggs are in it.
Oh boy.
Where's your leash? Here it is.
Come on.
Wait, Ruby, Ruby.
Hold on. Hold on, hold on.
I'm sorry, Mel. I couldn't
take her back to the shelter. I...
She loves it here.
She wants to be our dog.
I know she does.
You do?
- I realized something.
- What?
She reminds me of you.
Of me?
- I'm nothing like her.
- You are.
You're always busy, always enthusiastic,
going a mile a minute.
Maybe all she needs is routine.
Unconditional love.
And a crate.
Thank you.
Monks.
She needs to be a family dog first
and a K9 dog second.
- She can be both.
- Okay.
Welcome to our family.
I don't know if I can take it.
It's heartbreaking.
These sites say I've to be the alpha male,
but there are two approaches to training.
Positive with rewards,
or negative with punishment.
Mmm.
Hmm.
The positive one only. Ever.
And make sure Ruby knows what you want.
Don't be sad, Ruby. Don't be sad.
- Don't be sad, Ruby.
- I... I can't.
You didn't want to pee, huh? Come on.
Did she go?
Um...
She did.
Just now.
I think she's claiming this as her home.
- Oh, is that what she's doing?
- I believe so.
- Thank you.
- Welcome.
You're embarrassing me.
And you're embarrassing yourself.
But you don't even care.
See, Ruby? We do this outside.
Huh? Wanna give it a try?
Go ahead.
All right, what do you think?
Yeah. Smell that?
Good dog!
Good girl! Yeah, you did it!
I can't believe that worked.
All right, sit.
Sit.
Okay, all right. One thing at a time.
You want this? Want your stick?
Yeah. You want your stick?
Which one of you jokers took my panini?
- Hey.
- Hey.
I'd like you to see something.
It's off the kitchen video camera.
Okay.
You owe me a meatball panini, O'Neil.
Yes, Sarge.
Ruby, come on. No. Come on.
All right, stay. Stay.
Stay.
Ruby. Ruby.
Be the solution.
Not the problem.
Please, Ruby.
At this point,
we're just trying to condition your dog.
Click means reward.
So what you do now is reward your dog
for doing what you want.
Right? Yes.
It's saying, "Yes, I like what you did."
"Good dog."
Soon your dog will be able to perform
the commands without the click at all.
Sit.
Sit, please.
Sit, Ruby.
Sit.
Sit down.
Ruby, sit down.
Sit down!
Sit.
Maybe I'm deaf.
Or maybe I'm pretending to be deaf.
Mel. Can you hear this?
- 'Cause it's not working.
- Maybe it's the reward.
Hmm.
Here we go again.
Hi. Do you remember me?
I... I took Ruby home.
She's not responding to clicker training,
and I... I was hoping for some advice.
- You're not bringing her back?
- No.
Raw hot dog.
She will do anything for raw hot dog.
I... I should have told you.
Raw hot dog? All right, good.
Uh, yeah.
That's all I needed to know, so thank you.
Thanks.
The taller the hat, the closer to God.
Sit.
Good girl! Good girl!
Good girl. Okay.
All right, ready? Okay. Let's do it again.
Come on. Come on! Sit!
Sit.
Oh my God! Good girl!
Oh my God, you're so good.
You're so smart.
All right, come on. Come on.
One more time.
Good girl.
Yep, stay right there.
Come on.
Okay.
Come on.
Go get it!
Pick it up.
Good girl.
All right!
Come here. Come on. Go get it.
Okay...
Oh my God.
Home.
Ruby, you need an off switch.
I could hire you out to the power company.
I could hire you both out.
- Ruby ready for tomorrow?
- She has to be.
Can she sit and stay?
- Everything but.
- Uh-oh.
Just like you.
- I'm sitting. I'm staying.
- But you're about to go do something.
I left the hose running.
- Are you nervous?
- Hmm?
Maybe just get up.
All right. Come here, Rubes.
Yeah. Good girl.
She loves that.
- I couldn't sleep either.
- Yeah.
I have faith in you.
You need to have faith in yourself.
Thank you.
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Okay. Hey. Good.
Sit. Sit. Good.
Morning.
Welcome to the tryouts
for this year's K9 academy.
Who do we have there?
Um... Ruby.
Welcome, Ruby.
All right, dogs in the pen
while we get started inside.
Now, you're not trying out
for the K9 unit today.
You're trying out for my class,
which may or may not
qualify you to be a K9 unit officer.
If you are accepted,
these will be six weeks
of rigorous training.
Then you must pass
a final exam for certification,
which certifies you to work
in a K9 unit here or in another state.
A final point.
Your dog must have the right temperament.
So must you.
Search and rescue requires
calm focus and special compassion.
You will deal with people
who are missing loved ones
who might not return.
Ask yourself now,
is this work for you?
Those of you who are sure,
come on outside. Let's see how you do.
Boden, come on up.
Platz.
Fuss.
Schnell! Schnell! Schnell!
Ha!
Rather good, Renny.
Good boy, Renn.
Up!
- O'Neil, you're up.
- Okay. Let's go, Ruby. Come on.
Ruby, sit.
Down.
Heel.
Good girl. Good girl.
- Good girl.
- Yay, Ruby!
Come on.
Good girl. Good girl.
Come on. Come on. Yep, yep, yep.
Good girl! Come on.
All right.
Good Ruby. Come on, up!
Good job! Come on, come on!
Up!
Good girl!
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Sit.
Tell her to stay.
When I tell you to stay,
you cannot move, no matter what.
Stay!
Pace out ten feet. Do not turn around.
I had to drop off Finn at my mom's.
What'd I miss?
They're passing.
She still has to stay for five minutes
with Daniel ten feet away.
Oh boy.
Stay. Please stay.
- Five minutes.
- Yay!
Good girl! Good girl!
Yeah, good girl. All right, come on.
Now we test all teams
for drive and a good nose.
Search and rescue is...
Hey, Ruby! Sorry about that.
...serious work for us.
- Hot dogs?
- This is not good.
At least it's not a panini.
- No, hey
- But for K9s,
- each mission is a game.
- Stop. Stop.
- Food is what motivates dogs.
- Stop, stop. Down.
That and pleasing you.
Hey. Stop. Stop.
Just one piece.
Treats are for a job well done.
Not for bribing your dog to behave.
Okay. I know this
will be new to all of you.
I have hidden a human tooth.
Considerate it cadaver material.
It's an exercise
in searching for a dead body.
Today, I want each of you
to scent train your K9
to seek and find that tooth.
Me first? A single tooth?
All right.
You're gonna teach her to do this
using a unique command.
- "Look for it."
- Okay.
Stop. Stop it, Ruby.
Ruby, come on. Ruby, stop.
Your dog's not using her thinking brain.
She's not focused.
- We'll come back to you. Back in line.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Peter, your dog's had
some minimal search training.
Let's show by example.
- Tell him to search.
- Okay.
Look for it. Look for it.
- How does he know what he's looking for?
- It takes time.
But eventually he will learn
to associate that particular command
with finding cadaver material,
once you click and reward him.
- Ruby!
- Control that K9!
Yeah. Ruby.
Deepen your voice.
Be commanding.
Ruby!
Sorry.
Hey, hey. Come here. Come here.
Ruby.
Ruby.
Ruby!
Ruby!
That's a hell of a bark.
Okay, I want you to tell your dogs
to search for him.
He's a moving target. Let's go.
Ruby! Ruby!
Ruby!
Okay.
Oh boy.
Ruby.
Hey, no! No, no, no, no. Hey.
Ruby, put it down.
Put the stick down!
- Ruby.
- Good job, everyone.
- Go ahead and reward.
- Ruby.
- Put it down.
- What's she playing with there?
Um...
Oh! Retreat! Retreat!
Run! Run!
Hey. Ruby.
Come here.
Ow. Ow!
Ow. Come on. Come on.
It's not Ruby's fault.
She's not bred for this work.
She's half Border collie,
one of the smartest breeds.
She hasn't had all the advantages.
She's all over the place.
She's not focusing on the tasks at hand.
We're not in the class, right?
- Did everybody else qualify?
- You're good at so many other things.
- You gotta be realistic.
- I am.
Sorry.
So what next?
I'm sorry, Mel.
I wanted this for both of us.
For all of us.
A better life.
You know I have a thing for superheroes?
You wanna be one?
Dogs have their noses.
I always thought if I had
a partner with a superpower,
it would cover for my weaknesses.
In trooper academy, you made up
for dyslexia and hyperactivity
with all-nighters and books on tape.
Bigger guys than you
hit you hard in the boxing ring.
You would not drop.
Then you shattered your kneecap
just before that mandatory race,
and you hobbled
the entire two miles in pain.
I came in last.
You finished.
Maybe it's not in the plan.
I can't see a path forward from here.
And sheer willpower's not gonna work.
I could push myself but not Ruby.
Yeah.
A-ticka-ticka-ticka. A-ticka-ticka.
Come here...
I know. I know.
House.
I come bearing gifts.
- Are we having a barbecue?
- You chose a dog just like you.
Yeah, you've said that. More than once.
You say you hated school.
You didn't want to sit at your desk.
- You wanted to run around, not read.
- Reading's not my thing.
Teachers underestimated you,
but you have always been smart.
No... You didn't get to the point
where you get to the point.
You would've done better homeschooled.
Didn't really have that back then.
Homeschooling would have
appreciated your differences,
your energy, your passions.
Encouraging your strengths
instead of focusing on your weaknesses,
with lessons tailored to you.
Be right back, buddy.
Your mother's a genius.
Hi, little man. Oh!
Maybe K9 school's not for Ruby.
Maybe what she needs
is one-on-one learning
with a teacher who respects
her unique, special abilities.
More fun, less work,
more quiet figuring things out,
less yelling, right? No bullies.
There's more than one way to pass
that final exam for K9 certification.
Right. I'll use all my vacation days.
Starting tomorrow.
Baby!
Uh...
Doubt there's an audiobook
for this, though.
I'll be your audiobook.
Hey. A-ha.
- Hi, kid.
- Hey.
What is all this stuff?
K9 dogs have to get used
to seeing gruesome stuff.
- Oh, I get it.
- Come on.
Good!
Find it.
Good. Good girl!
You found the phone.
- Good!
- Whoo!
She sure has come a long way. Huh?
Hey! We're rich!
Whoa! That real?
Yeah.
- From my dentist.
- Explain this one more time.
For a missing person, you wouldn't
give Ruby something of theirs to sniff?
No. She's learning
to seek human scent only.
So she'll know what to search for
based on the command I give her.
It could be something touched by a person,
or it could be a person, dead or alive.
Hey, Daniel. We figured
Ruby could use some socializing.
Our dogs could use it as well.
Ah.
Nice.
Told ya.
They're all talking about it.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
- Gansett?
- Thank you.
- Free burgers, Danny boy.
- That's right.
Free beer!
- You nervous about tomorrow?
- No.
- Liar.
- Yep.
- You want me to come?
- No.
If we fail,
I won't be able to look at you.
Okay.
"The K9 certification exam
is given once a year."
"It requires handler and K9
to seek three specific items
along an outdoor course in 30 minutes."
Okay, just this once.
Good girl, Ruby.
The past six weeks have been a journey.
Look who's here. Daniel O'Neil.
Nowhere in your book
does it say we have to take your class,
only pass your final test.
- Yeah. Come on. Let 'em try.
- They've worked hard, earned the right.
I was just gonna say...
It's nice to see you back, Daniel O'Neil.
This is how it will work.
Each team will get 30 minutes
to find three things.
Cell phone,
firearm, human remains.
First up, Peter and Kohl.
- Could we go first?
- You got a plane to catch?
I'm... I'm just anxious.
They can go. It's fine.
Okay. First up, Daniel and Ruby.
Come on.
Test starts out here,
finishes inside.
Your time starts now.
Okay, seek. Come on. Seek.
She has it.
First object. Cell phone.
- Good job. Keep going.
- Seek!
She has it.
Second object.
Firearm.
That is two objects
in less than two minutes. Extraordinary.
- Now we head inside.
- Ruby, come on.
Your dogs can relax
until we get back outside.
- Where are they?
- Inside.
- That's not in the manual.
- I know, right?
But they did really good so far.
Zarella's always got
a trick or two up his sleeve.
All right, Ruby. Okay. All right.
Final item.
Human remains.
Right. Now you go on.
Look for it!
Whoa!
What the heck?
- It's a big place.
- We blocked off some wings.
Come on, Ruby.
What's she telling you?
- There are no remains here.
- Are you sure?
You get one wrong, I can't pass you.
Uh, if she says it's not here,
it's not here.
Well, I guess maybe not everyone's
gonna pass today.
But you and Ruby did.
In record time.
It was a negative search.
Sometimes you're gonna be sent for things
that end up not being there.
Congratulations!
Good girl. Thank you.
- You've done good.
- Good girl.
Both of you.
We passed!
Oh!
- We passed!
- Yes!
- Well done.
- That was great.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Hey, Ruby.
Great, Daniel.
- Congrats.
- Thanks. Thank you.
- Great. Good job.
- O'Neil.
I want you to come work for me.
Provisionally.
We gotta see if Ruby's as good
in the real world as she was today.
I'd be honored, sir.
The vest is for her.
Yeah.
Stay ready,
and you won't have to get ready.
Hey, how about that, huh?
How about that?
Good girl.
Ta-da.
Mel, it's too early to party.
I'm provisional.
Be grateful.
- We should've invited Zarella.
- No.
I'll take that.
Good dog. Come on.
Good, Ruby.
Find them! Find them!
Good girl!
Good job, Ruby.
Rube, here we go. Here we go, Ruby.
All right. Yeah, turn, turn.
Turning.
Look who's here.
Yeah.
Hey, did you know if humans disappeared,
the planet would be better off?
But if ants disappeared,
the whole thing
would come apart at the seams.
You're not listening.
Sam, everything's the same,
except for my uniform.
The senior K9 teams
are seizing cash from drug dealers
and apprehending suspects. And...
I've been sitting on my hands for...
months. The leaves have changed.
Being the junior team
means you wait your turn.
- You scared of him?
- I am.
Me too.
Who's that?
That's Zarella.
There's a search down city.
The senior teams are on other calls.
- Text me when you find the stash.
- No. It's not stolen stuff.
It's a murder victim.
I gotta go. Ruby.
All right.
We gotta get this right.
You good to go?
Yeah? All right, thank you.
Don't let me down.
Police have a suspect in custody.
There's a missing person
presumed dead here.
Right.
Show 'em what you can do.
Look for it!
I think she found something.
What you got?
Nothing.
Yeah.
It's clean.
You gotta make the call. Officially.
No body.
What...
All right, Ruby.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
You just blew it, Ruby.
You blew it!
Zarella's gonna call
and release me from his unit.
I'm so sorry.
No, I'm the stupid jerk
Zarella always thought.
A guy who doesn't know
his own limitations or his dog's.
- I'm sorry, Mel.
- I don't care if you're in the K9 unit.
We can manage without the extra money.
I married you, not your job.
My husband has his own superpowers.
His big heart.
His boundless energy.
His ability to hyper-focus on things.
How he forgives.
How he never gives up.
How he trusts
in something bigger than himself.
I'm keeping this one.
Saving the world isn't the goal, love.
Stop.
Go.
Ruby.
Ruby.
Ruby, come here, girl.
Ruby.
Ruby!
I'm such an idiot.
She's gone, Mel. It's my fault.
I pushed her. I stressed her.
Then I blamed her for not performing.
I didn't think she could do it,
and then she didn't.
I mean, so what if she's not a K9 dog?
She's still a great dog.
She's our dog. All of ours.
I know.
I'm gonna find her.
Ruby!
Ruby!
Come here. Ruby!
Come on.
Commander, sir.
We found the body.
We got a tip from a neighbor.
Buried under the deck,
covered in three inches of cement.
It's a miracle Ruby even caught the scent.
You made the wrong call.
- You should have trusted your K9.
- I...
Ah.
Ruby!
Ruby!
Ruby!
Hi. Have you seen this dog?
Ruby.
Hmm, no.
- Okay.
- Sorry.
Thank you.
- Bye.
- Thank you.
- Mama.
- Yeah, I know.
Ruby!
Ruby!
I've got you a hot dog, Ruby.
Hot dog.
Ball Park Frank all the way from Fenway.
Fenway.
Ruby!
Ruby.
Uh, Ruby's run away.
Has she come back here?
No. I'm sorry.
Okay...
All right. Thank you.
Uh...
- Uh, sir, I...
- Dan, there's a boy missing.
Bring Ruby and meet the unit.
I'll text you the address.
- Dan!
- Ruby's not here. She ran.
Well, go get her!
You're no K9 unit without a partner.
Sir.
Uh...
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
Yeah, get in. Get in.
- I'll take you where you need to go.
- Yeah.
- Which way?
- Go! Go!
Which way? Where are we going?
I lost my driver's license. Weak eyes.
I need to try that Uber thing.
Where's Ruby?
I, uh, wish I knew.
I've been looking all day.
Dogs don't leave a good thing.
I messed up.
I didn't trust her.
I... I let pressure get to me.
I did to her what people do to me.
Underestimate me, count me out.
- That's why I work harder.
- To prove 'em wrong.
Yeah, you know, to...
To show I measure up.
I'm not the stupid hyperactive kid
who couldn't read.
- And have you proved it?
- Yeah.
I mean to yourself.
Sure.
Turn your blinker on.
Pull over at Katt's here.
I'm thinking you're the one who's lost,
not Ruby.
Ruby, where are you?
Come back!
You didn't let me down. I let you down.
I'm the one who's gotta change.
I have to trust.
Really trust.
My God.
Ruby?
I'm sorry.
There's a missing boy in Glocester.
It's on the news.
Zarella called.
Whole team's mobilized.
I didn't believe in her.
Do you know why?
I don't believe in myself.
Hey.
Hey, Danny.
Grinnell's called a meeting.
- You gotta get in here.
- Okay. Thanks.
Glocester boy was hiking yesterday
with his mother in familiar woods.
He took a shortcut home alone
and never showed.
Zarella's K9 unit has been searching.
O'Neil. Find your K9.
And when you do, put a GPS tracker on her.
Be safe, everyone.
Ruby?
Ruby! Hey!
Oh.
I never should have thought
you couldn't do it.
I never should have doubted you. Or us.
Let's get you home, all right? Come on.
Ruby, no.
You wanna go?
Let's go to the search.
Eat 'em all.
Mel. Mel, hey.
She's back. She's back. I got her.
We're heading to the search.
Let's go. Let's go. Good girl.
O'Neil.
You ready? You don't look ready.
- Reporting for duty, sir.
- Can I count on you?
Never more than now, sir.
Call everyone back.
Set up a perimeter.
I need everyone out of those woods.
I got my best K9 here ready to go.
All right, I want Ruby to pick up
the most concentrated scent.
It should be the boy's,
not one of our guys'.
You need a coffee?
- No.
- All right.
All right. Here's where we are here.
All of this here is nature preserve.
Dense woods,
granite outcroppings, a thousand acres.
They started off here, the boy's home.
That's the house right behind us.
They went around and across the pond here.
That's when Michael went off on his own,
presumably to head back home.
Best hope is he got lost.
The terrain is extremely dangerous.
Lots of widow-makers.
My other teams
are tired, hungry.
They're exhausted.
He's got very worried parents.
I want good news for them.
I know you can do it.
Find him!
Don't let one emergency become two!
- Here, take my hat.
- Okay. Thank you.
- No one's out there?
- Just you and the boy. Good luck.
- Good luck, buddy!
- Thanks.
What? What?
Good girl, Ruby! Good girl!
All right.
Good girl, Ruby. Good girl.
We have him. We have him down a cliff.
We have him.
Boy's location?
Boy's condition?
Daniel.
He's out of range.
Michael!
Michael, I'm coming.
Michael!
Michael!
Good girl! Good girl, Ruby.
Good, Ruby.
Good girl, Ruby. Good dog.
Good dog.
All right, come on. Michael.
Michael, can you hear me?
Good girl. Good girl.
Michael?
Hey, Michael, can you hear me?
We got you, bud. We got you.
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.
Hey. Hey, Michael. Hi.
Michael, I'm Daniel O'Neil.
This is Ruby, my K9 partner.
- Cold.
- You're cold? Here.
Here, you're cold. Here you go, bud.
Here you go. All right.
There you go.
Are you hurt anywhere?
- My... My leg.
- Your leg?
- This one?
- Ah!
Yeah? That hurts? All right.
Hang on, bud. We got you.
Okay? Just stay with me.
This is 223. We have him.
Forty-one degrees, 54, 42.4 north.
Seventy-one degrees, 42, 49.2 west.
Good girl. All right, stay with me, bud.
We have him. Grave condition. Send medics.
They can't hear me.
Hear that barking.
Shut up! Everyone stop talking!
Listen.
That's Ruby.
Follow me!
Let's go. Hurry up.
Let's go! Let's go!
Right, keep barking, Ruby. Keep barking.
This way.
Careful through the water.
Please keep barking.
Just hang with me, bud.
- Daniel!
- Hey!
- O'Neil, we're here.
- He's alive.
Hypothermic, possible concussion.
Broken leg, internal injuries.
- Let's go. We'll get him out.
- All right.
We're gonna
get you out of here, buddy.
Yeah. Just stay with me, okay?
Hang in there.
Good girl. Good girl.
Good girl. Good girl. Good girl.
Oh, thank God.
The boy's gonna need crutches for a while,
but he's fine.
- Thank you.
- Well done, son.
Thank you for giving me a chance.
You got it.
- Couldn't be prouder.
- Thank you.
We got a very grateful mother here
who wants to say hello.
Oh, I...
Wait.
You're the lady from the shelter.
You found my son?
That wasn't me.
It was Ruby.
- She led the way.
- Ruby.
- Go ahead, girl.
- Oh, Ruby.
Who's a good girl!
Oh, I knew there was goodness in you.
You all know each other?
She was supposed to be put down,
and then he came along.
You've saved a life, you know?
And then she saved your son's.
- Wow.
- Now there's a wink from above.
- Mrs. Inman?
- Oh, I think they're calling you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Trooper O'Neil.
You're official.
Promoted to full status K9 unit.
- Thank you.
- Told you he'd come through for you.
You did.
But you had him help me?
He's my best scout.
Scout?
Matt's always been rooting for you.
All right, Ruby. Come on.
- Thank you, officer.
- Sure. Have a good morning.
Thank you.
Hey, Mel. What are you...
Aw.
Wow, Daniel.
Unbelievable, man. Great work.
- Thank you.
- Well done, Dan.
- Here's your hat.
- Oh! Thanks for the hat.
Anytime.
- Incredible work. Incredible search.
- Thank you.
- Well done.
- Thank you so much.
I...
What?
I'm just happy.
