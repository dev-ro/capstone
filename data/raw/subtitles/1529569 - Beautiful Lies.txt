No, i know it won't suit me.
Trust me.
i know i'm right.
You'll look better without the fringe.
No, mademoiselle.
Emilie.
i've always had it.
i'll leave it, but shorter.
Leave it.
Look...
Look.
That lights up your whole face.
A face needs a good frame
or no one looks at it.
Good.
Sylvia!
Sheer Hair, Paulette speaking.
With.
Without.
With.
Without.
Maybe a bit shorter
would be better.
Your nose
will look narrower too.
i'd rather get a nose-job.
You won't notice it.
We just need...
to shorten it a little...
here.
There you go.
The eyebrows are visible now,
like the shape of your face.
She cut my fringe.
it looks lovely.
The bitch.
You're out of your mind!
i didn't mean to.
Emilie...
i live for the joy of watching you.
My eyes are my heart,
my eyes are my lungs.
if i close them when you pass,
my whole body cries out for air.
Emilie, you pass me at times
without knowing...
You cannot imagine my nervousness,
my love,
my gaze.
i hate the people who step between us
then love them when they move
and i see you again.
Emilie...
you brush past me
and, each time, i feel such joy.
Emilie, you brush past me
and, each time,
i suffer.
Too much love and not enough courage
make me a ghost.
My fine prose
makes an ugly anonymous letter.
Like a blank cheque,
it has no value.
Allow me to send it
without expectations
but hoping that the joy of being loved
will transport you.
You're beautiful, perplexing,
never disappointing.
i'll never possess you.
i'm inconsolable.
All the same, Emilie,
please accept my sincere, feverish
and anonymous feelings.
BEAUTiFUL LiES
Your mail.
Thanks, Paulette.
Hello, Jean.
Everything ok?
Yes. And you?
i'm fine.
Are the sauna tiles here?
Yes, i can start on them Monday.
Will you meet the deadline?
Yes.
The bank's on our backs.
it makes Sylvia so tense and touchy.
it'll be ready.
i'll go now.
You're not disturbing me.
Tell me, are you busy this Sunday?
This Sunday?
No, i have nothing on.
i'm free.
i was thinking
maybe you could use the time
to work on the sauna.
On Sunday?
Only if you can...
i could make noise.
Wonderful.
Sorry.
Could you...
Of course.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Lovely to see you.
Stay a little longer, Mum, please.
How long?
Half an hour?
1 5 minutes?
it's good to get out a bit.
i'm not sick.
A present for you.
Thank you, dear.
it's...
a colourful little muslin top
with cashmere motifs...
Blue, yellow...
Green...
That's nice.
For your birthday, i got you a cruise.
You pick the theme.
The Med on the trail of Ulysses.
Jordan on the trail of Jesus.
Or the Arctic
on the trail of the polar bear.
Thanks, but no thanks.
i'm fine at home...
on the trail of my couch.
You could see places, meet people...
Excuse me.
i'm really sorry to bother you.
This is silly
but could i borrow your magazine
for a second?
it may sound odd but that's
my husband's piece on the cover.
"False indolence".
Not a nice name, so he changed it
to "Maddy, Naked".
i'm Maddy.
it's a bit embarrassing.
i'd like to read this...
Me too.
i can pay you for it.
No, there's a newsstand
down at the harbour.
i'll rent it!
Will 20 euros for 5 minutes do?
30 euros? Please...
Emilie!
Your dad's made the cover
of "Art Presse" at last!
Get off my back.
What?
You were like a madwoman!
i wasn't.
You scared that poor guy.
i didn't. He gave it to me.
You terrified him.
You were there, drooling...
He did it to get rid of you.
Don't ethaggerate.
You're lisping?
The tea burned my tongue.
You're losing your mind.
Forget Dad.
He won't be back after 4 years.
Says who?
He's stopped loving you.
No, he's just met a 20-year-old girl.
You're crazy.
Where's my top?
i forgot it. Sorry. i'll get it.
Mum!
Look at yourself. it's spring.
You're in sweatpants.
But you're so beautiful.
if you just made a tiny effort...
if you...
Sorry to shame you.
You don't.
You'd like me to meet someone
who'll make me happy, take me out.
a good man...
He doesn't have to be good.
But i just can't.
Mum...
i don't want to love someone else.
Understand?
i just want to be sad.
i want to be sad, at home!
That's all!
Emilie...
Maddy...
i live for the joy of watching you.
My eyes are my heart,
my eyes are my lungs.
if i close them when you pass,
my whole body cries out for air.
Maddy, you pass me at times
without knowing...
Maddy...
i live for the joy of watching you.
My eyes are my heart,
my eyes are my lungs.
if i close them when you pass,
my whole body cries out for air.
Maddy, you brush past me
and, each time, i suffer.
Too much love
and not enough courage...
Hello.
my top.
i went And got it back.
i didn't think you'd come.
i wanted to Get out.
You're beautiful, perplexing,
never disappointing.
i'll never possess you.
i'm inconsolable.
So you're fluent in Korean.
And Japanese.
Were you yelling in Korean or Japanese?
Chinese.
Why didn't you put that in your CV?
Head of...
What was it?
Translations, Asian department.
Why not?
i didn't think it matched
what you wanted.
How many people worked for you
at ENESCO?
UNESCO?
Yes, UNESCO, that's what i said.
How many?
Did you study a lot to get there?
So why work here when you could be
translating important stuff?
i was fired.
Why, if i may ask?
i had a breakdown.
in talks between italy and China,
i hit the italian ambassador...
and burst into tears.
you speak italian too?
Yes.
And then?
i decided to move down here.
i saw your ad in the window:
"Maintenance and Painting".
Those words made me feel better.
"Maintenance and Painting"?
Yes, it was exactly what i wanted.
To do simple things
in an easy job
with no responsibilities.
it's a job with no responsibilities?
i didn't mean that.
You're in charge of maintenance,
the safety and health of our clients.
And staff.
Of course.
You're wiring the whole sauna.
you know about electricity?
Yes.
You're worrying me.
i've always loved doing odd jobs.
Odd jobs?!
i need to know if i can trust you.
you can.
i'm not so sure. You lied to me.
i tried to keep it quiet.
it's a new salon.
You've taken a loan.
Seeing those girls steal got me mad.
You can go.
How much do i owe you?
45 euros, please.
Everything all right?
Perfect, thank you.
Really?
Paulette...
Know what would be good
with the customers?
Try to be a little more light-hearted
and funny with them.
Make them laugh.
Laugh?
Well, if someone's waiting,
instead of "Who's next?",
you can say, "Next victim!"
Next victim?
With the right tone.
Or something else.
All right.
Sheer Hair...
Paulette, it's Emilie.
Could you put Sylvia on?
Sylvia, it's Emilie.
it's Emilie.
it's Emilie!
Sylvia, it's me.
Everything ok?
Could you ask Jean not to leave
his boxes in the entrance?
And the towels aren't folded properly.
Listen, this has been going on
for 5 days now.
if you want something,
you can ask him yourself.
i can't do it.
What?
Ask him things.
But he works for you!
Now i know he studied 1 50 years,
i feel he's judging me.
Like Fran?ois. That's why i left him.
i know guys like him.
They look at you,
say nothing and you feel stupid.
This animated sequence will show us
what happens when this lady
ingests sugar.
After a meal,
sugar levels in the blood rise.
The sugar is represented
by these tiny crystals.
Shit!
i was doing housework.
i forgot our date.
You spied on me?
Not at all.
i just looked in at the window.
What's wrong?
All our chats begin like that.
Has something happened?
Still nothing.
Expecting a letter?
i'm ashamed.
What have you done?
i've had a letter.
An anonymous letter.
Threats?
No.
God, you had me worried!
A love letter.
Really beautiful.
inspired...
Moving...
A simple declaration
expecting nothing in return.
That's incredible.
i wanted to meet the writer.
Not for his love.
For his awkwardness...
His fragility...
it was like receiving a letter
from the 1 8th century,
from italy or Germany.
That's wonderful.
it's pathetic.
Why pathetic? it's wonderful.
An angel wrote to you.
An idler!
i've been waiting 5 days.
For another letter?
Why?
What do you mean, why?
if you had such a moving letter,
wouldn't you expect another?
Not necessarily.
Wouldn't you want to know who wrote it,
what he looked like?
Why seek more?
i just want to meet him.
it's not possible!
Got his photo? Know his name? No!
So think positive!
Sorry, but that's hard.
This letter has given you
a new taste for life.
it's an unexpected gift
and you make it a burden.
We have nothing in common.
i wonder if i was adopted.
No, don't worry, i remember it.
On being born,
you already had that critical look.
You prefer to be disappointed
and stay sad like before.
i'll leave you to your housework.
have you talked to Your mum?
Hi, Dad.
You're younger by the day.
Drop the car for a skateboard.
You told her?
Estelle wants to marry
before the baby arrives.
She's conservative for her age.
Tell your mum i want a divorce
or i will.
i'll do it. Just be patient!
You said that last week.
i'm preparing her.
Not for bad news.
i can!
How? By getting her drunk?
i'm trying to give her
self-confidence.
My marble statues never managed to.
She's too fragile right now, i swear.
it'll kill her to find out.
if she can't accept it after 4 years,
she never will.
For pity's sake, Dad...
Wait. i can help her.
You can't change someone.
you can.
We have nothing in common.
So i'm told!
You'd like everything to heal.
But some wounds just never vanish.
They can't heal.
if she hadn't been your refuge
when you were lonely or drunk,
she'd have healed sooner.
You're so perfect.
i'll call Maddy next week.
How are you?
i'm ok.
Paulette!
i told Sylvia to ask Jean
to fold the towels.
Ask if he did it.
Ask Jean?
No, Sylvia!
if she folded the towels?
No, if she asked Jean to do it.
it hasn't been done.
Why didn't Jean do it if she asked?
Do you want me to fold the towels?
Ask Jean if she asked him
and why he didn't if she did!
What did she say?
i don't know, ma'am.
You have to help me.
Sylvia.
Call me Sylvia.
Who?
Maddy, my Maddy...
i'm far away
but i'm...
here.
That's good.
Maddy,
i'm far away
but i'm here.
He wrote so what's the problem?
What?
it's a bit upsetting.
What do you mean?
i don't know. it's all gone.
Look.
it's good. What's the problem?
You can see. it's dull.
No feeling, no inspiration.
it's laboured, fake...
Understand?
it's useless.
it's frigid!
can a letter be frigid?
This one is.
You're too harsh.
There's some wonderful stuff here.
i love this warm wind
carrying him to you.
There's no feeling, no beauty.
Why would He write it then?
No idea.
Maybe he's distancing himself.
He wouldn't write this if he were!
Look...
"Your hair in the radiant sun
"and your blue blouse
like a radiant sky..."
The repetition is no big deal.
Sun, wind, it's a weather forecast!
Come on.
Maybe the poor guy's just tired.
Maybe he has a hard life
with people pissing him off.
Know how i knew your dad
no longer loved me?
From the way he drew me.
i knew before he did.
it's the same here.
He doesn't love me anymore.
it's sad.
i loved waiting for the mail,
trembling in the garden...
That's how it is.
Why say that?
Maybe he saw me somewhere
and was disappointed.
You're not disappointing!
Look at the bags under my eyes,
my skin.
Maybe he found me less pretty.
Too old.
Or he sobered up.
That's how it is anyhow.
Maddy...
Your proud and arrogant breasts...
Your bosom...
Your bosom... Proud and arrogant...
May i disturb you for a second?
Come in.
i'm wondering if there's a problem.
A problem where?
Between you...
and me.
No, no problem.
You have a problem with me?
No, none at all.
i meant where you're concerned.
You don't speak to me
and i sense irritation.
You sense irritation?
Exactly.
i even sense it right now.
Very strongly.
You're right.
you sensed correctly.
i thought so.
This may sound absurd,
but now i know you were at Harvard,
i can't talk to you.
i make you uneasy?
Yes.
i'm sorry.
Me too.
i just can't ask you anything.
You're wrong.
You're right and i'm wrong,
but that's how it is.
That's not what i meant.
i don't know what you mean.
i just can't work with you.
You make me uncomfortable, see.
i keep wondering
if i'm making grammatical mistakes.
Have i made any? Some? Any?
Well, have i?
A few.
Tiny ones.
Common ones made in speech.
You'll finish the month.
is that correct?
Perfectly correct.
Maddy, your proud, arrogant breasts...
Mum...
Mum... Maddy!
Your vibrant body
seems to shine
with a fresh glow.
Your slender hips...
and your supple gait...
A drink...
For God's sake, a drink.
A promise...
of sensuality...
and indolence.
Are you ok?
Yes, i got here early
to finish some paperwork.
That's good.
You know, social security, VAT...
We're late.
You have a paperclip...
No, there.
i must have dozed off.
i've been thinking.
i guess i'm too stressed,
too edgy.
i pressure you too much.
No, not at all.
i do. That's why...
you drank a bit last night.
A little.
i need to be more confident.
i'm mad at myself
but i'm worried.
Shit!Jean...
You'll be pleased,
the towels are all neat.
i fired him.
What?
i gave him a month's notice.
What for?
We're partners.
You could have asked me first!
He could sue us if he wanted.
He doesn't care about money.
We'll never find another like him!
i daren't look at him.
Hide me.
Step to the left.
He's looking over here.
No, my left!
Hide me.
My left...
My left, dammit!
Shit, i feel bad.
How long till the end of the month?
27 days.
i don't believe it.
Send him on an errand. Just today.
Until i get over it. Please.
For supplies, the mail...
Anything.
Shit!
it's hot...
i think it could be more feminine.
Want to change the colour?
Let's get you shampooed then.
Get a robe.
i saw him!
What?
The letter guy. My secret lover.
i saw him!
What do you mean?
Why are you barefoot in your nightie?
Listen to me, dammit!
He dropped his letter off.
i saw him and followed him here.
There he is.
There.
Behind you.
He works here.
The letter...
He delivered it by hand?
What a jerk!
Why?
What?
Why say that?
Because...
Because it's risky.
You always post an anonymous letter.
From another town at times.
Good, he's not an expert.
He's coming over.
Near the perfumes. See him?
He's very young.
Sure it's him?
Sure i'm sure.
He works for you!
i bet he noticed me here.
Maybe He posted it for someone.
Who?
i don't know. A customer,
a member of staff...
you think so?
i'm just trying to think fast.
i'll ask him!
Don't!
it's the best way.
Not in here.
i'll be discreet.
You're crazy!
Why doesn't he sign?
He's probably scared.
Of his feelings, himself, you...
What?
Mum, he's a very shy young man
for whom i have a lot of esteem.
if it's him, be careful.
Don't force things.
You'd hurt him.
A lot.
You're scaring me...
You can be so slow sometimes!
i could give him a sign from afar
to show him he risks nothing.
What kind of sign?
Hold on, Mum... Look at you.
You're barefoot and you're in...
i don't know.
You want to approach him like that?
No, you're right.
You look like you escaped
from an asylum.
He doesn't know. Use that.
Tame him gently. From afar.
Be reassuring, seductive...
Reassuring, you're right.
i look awful.
Thank God i have you.
You said it.
i'll be going.
Look, it's touching.
What is?
He's struggling not to look at me.
Moving, isn't it?
Very.
Fuck...
i'm in the shit.
Maddy, your proud and arrogant breasts
haunt my dreams.
Your shoulders like arrows
stuck in your graceful neck,
your slender hips and supple gait
are a promise of sensuality
indolence and wonder.
Your eyes speak of fire and storms
and your graceful body
seems to cry out
to be carried off
into the stormy skies of passion...
i have heartburn.
Hold on a second.
Take two to halt it.
i need some too.
Not having lunch?
i told Jean you'd see him.
i want him back. We need him.
Still here?
i didn't think...
i'm waiting for Ms Marti.
She's with Ms Dandrieux, in her office.
She's my daughter.
Ms Dandrieux.
She's my daughter.
i'm Emilie's mother.
Yes, i know.
Of course.
You know.
Of course.
i came to see her.
My daughter.
i wanted to ask her something.
All right.
i was here earlier
but i forgot to ask her
so i've come back
to ask her. Now.
So...
i'll wait.
Me too.
it's wiser...
Right?
Then again,
if you wait too long,
sometimes
you let things pass you by...
Opportunities...
i love this cream.
it's so light.
So fluid!
i recommended it.
i found it in an old perfumery
in the Peloponnesus
where i'd isolated myself
to write a little...
To meditate.
Do you know Greece?
A poet wrote some beautiful lines:
"What magical essence,
"prepared by the ancient Greek magi
of Syria,
"what essence could one discover
"that would return
our tiny room to me?"
Beautiful, hmm?
Yes, but frightening.
Exactly! You're so right.
You just said a very pretty thing.
Of course...
Mum...
i forgot you were coming.
That's all right.
Jean kindly kept me company.
Thank you, Jean.
You're welcome.
i'll put this back.
Excuse me.
Come on, let's do that massage.
i promised her a foot massage
because i massage feet very well.
What are you doing?
You told me to charm him from afar.
Call this from afar?
i can't from my couch.
You left 3 minutes ago
and i find you with your tits
in his face!
i've read his letter now.
i'm disturbing you...
a little.
i don't mind.
Ms Marti told me
you wanted to see me.
Should i wait?
Maybe we can talk later.
No, come in!
Ms Marti told me
i was no longer fired.
You were fired?
He was fired?
A little.
May i ask why?
i don't need to explain to you!
i'll go...
i was going to tell you later
but you're welcome to stay.
You're no longer fired.
Of course i'd like to stay.
i'm sorry.
i was unfair.
i'm sure you had your reasons.
What reasons?
i won't disturb you any longer.
i'd glad you're staying.
Very kind, ma'am.
Maddy.
i'm sorry?
You can say "Maddy" too.
i can't, ma'am.
Really, i...
i understand, Jean.
Right.
i'll leave you.
He's so young!
So fragile.
i understand now.
He'll slowly emerge from his shell.
He's dying to.
Some details don't lie.
He undid his top shirt button
before coming in.
i'll go now.
Wait, take my shoes.
you look a bit crazy.
True.
i have another pair.
Goodbye, Emilie.
i'm in the shit...
i'm in deep shit.
Jean...
i know who you are.
i want who you are.
Emilie...
i found your note in my pocket
when i left the salon
with those simple, direct words
that so resemble you:
"i know who you are,
i want who you are."
Emilie, and so you knew.
So you love me.
it's Emilie.
Yes. Emilie, your boss.
Good evening.
Everything ok?
Yes, fine.
May i come up?
To my place?
Well, yes.
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
Can you let me in?
Second floor.
Shit...
Sorry, it's a bit late.
Not at all.
i was working out.
Come in, please.
Listen, Jean.
i need to tell you something important.
it can't wait.
After, it will be too late.
i understand.
if you wait, you let things go by.
Exactly.
it's about my mother.
it's a bit complicated.
A few weeks ago,
i had an odd letter.
Meaning?
An anonymous love letter.
Written by an old person, i think.
Why say that?
The style was outdated.
i think the writer has difficulty moving.
i see.
Why?
An intuition.
it's someone who observes from afar.
i think it's Mr Pastor.
The old man always watching next door.
Sylvia thinks he masturbates
watching us.
So i give him a little wave every day.
if it makes him happy...
That's kind of you.
Anyhow...
My mother's not well.
She isn't?
She's never got over
my father leaving her.
i've tried everything.
She's declining,
losing her confidence, her aura.
Brilliant...
Sorry?
How fond people can get.
My future stepmother, younger than me,
is pregnant.
That's good.
No, it's terrible.
Sorry. i'll be right back.
My father is a coward,
so i have to break it to my mother.
it could kill her.
True, when things come as a shock...
i tried to prepare her,
give her strength
and confidence, see?
Of course.
i sent her the letter.
What?
The anonymous letter.
i copied it and sent it to her.
And the trouble is...
my mother believes you wrote it.
Me?
Why me?
She saw you drop it off.
At her place.
Excuse me. i'll be right back.
i can't tell her i copied it out
and wrote the next two letters!
You kept on writing?
The letter revived her.
She needed others to help her.
it's getting late. i'm beat.
Tell me the rest tomorrow.
Right now, i need...
Jean...
i was wondering if...
if you could... would...
if you would...
Both work.
Be the writer. For a while.
Sorry?
The letter.
Let her think it was you.
Me?
And take her out.
For dinner, to a movie.
Nothing compromising.
Look at her with shining eyes.
For a while.
i can't do shining eyes to order.
Nor the rest.
i'll pay you.
Pay me?
By the hour.
With expenses for dinner
and the cinema.
What?
is this why i'm not fired anymore?
So you could ask me this?
Not at all.
Sorry, i can't.
Jean... it's partly your fault.
You didn't mail the letter.
Yes, it's all my fault.
But i won't do it.
You understand? i won't do it.
Don't be ironic.
it's your fault.
You were asked to mail a letter.
No need to study at Wembley for that!
Berkeley.
Wembley's a stadium.
i hate you.
i'd like to go to bed now.
Go ahead.
i suppose i'm fired again?
Absolutely!
Effective tomorrow. Goodbye.
Maddy...
i charmed you like a coward
hidden behind my keyboard
and now i abandon you like a coward.
The mirror before me
reflects a cowardly and gutless man.
An eternal student with a dull life,
hidden behind his books,
terrified by reality and, moreover,
physically unprepossessing.
The world is full of brave,
charming,
virile men
who deserve you more than i do.
Farewell.
i'll free you and flee.
i don't deserve your forgiveness.
i just ask you to be happy,
for you can be.
And you must be.
You had no right!
i charmed you like a coward,
hidden behind my keyboard,
and now i abandon you like a coward.
The mirror before me
reflects a cowardly and gutless man...
Next victim.
Where are you going?
To talk to your mother.
No. Please don't.
She'll never forgive me.
i'm so sorry. i screwed up.
it wasn't against you,
it was for her.
i couldn't tell.
i'm not like that!
Of course you are!
Facing you now, i hate myself.
i'm glad to hear it.
Let's go.
This is mine.
God knows why it's here,
but it's mine!
Let me explain!
Leave me alone!
it's all a stupid misunderstanding.
That helps a lot.
i'd like to be alone!
Maddy.
See, you can do it.
Listen to me, please.
Maddy, we need to talk.
My husband.
i have to answer this.
Are you sure?
Of course.
Marc? Yes, just a second.
i'll see someone out.
just go.
i can wait.
i don't want you to!
Yes, i'm listening.
Of course.
Really?
How many months?
isn't it a bit sudden?
All right.
Goodbye, Marc.
And good luck.
Yes, goodbye.
i'd like you to go now.
Really.
Don't cry, please.
Life is a bitch!
Don't cry anymore, Maddy.
Your mother wants to talk to you.
Tell her...
Tell her i'm sick.
No, that i've left for the day.
She just wants her hair done.
She seems excited.
What do you mean, excited?
i don't know... Crazy, happy.
Talk to her.
That's wonderful.
it's just that...
i'd never have imagined it.
Yes, it's beautiful,
it's very beautiful.
Really?
That's wonderful.
i have to go now.
Yes, it's wonderful.
Sure i'll make you beautiful.
Sure.
Seen my bag?
A big black plastic bag.
Haven't seen one.
it was here, with my things in it.
i swear.
i haven't seen it.
all my things were in it.
i swear.
Shit!
i don't believe it!
i suppose i'm hired again?
if you wish, of course.
Seen my bag?
it had things i'm fond of in it.
Maybe Maria threw them out.
They were in a bin bag?
i wanted to thank you.
i did it for her, not for you.
But i can thank you anyway.
When i realized what you had done...
That gesture,
that kind hand without knowing her,
without wanting to...
Just to soothe her.
i saw how crazy my request was.
it's a bit late.
Maria doesn't work today.
i know what you did with my bag.
You're really...
i'm sorry.
For everything.
i don't hurt people.
i'm not stern, harsh...
in actual fact, you are.
it was to help her.
Loathsome people have great excuses.
Like you, i suppose.
Just be nice to her tonight.
You're having dinner?
i insist on refunding you.
i may not go.
Listening to you, i want to flee.
Don't make her pay for my mistakes.
i'll do as i want!
Please.
i'll do as i want!
And then,
he laid his hand on my head,
like you now,
and said beautiful words,
soothing words.
Such as?
About your father, say.
He was so shrewd.
He said if my love was a burden,
i had to stop loving him.
That's the ultimate gesture:
to stop loving someone
out of love for them.
Feeling better now?
He put his hand on your head,
said that and you're cured?
Maybe he'll change water
into wine later.
Or champagne!
i hope so, Mum.
i hope so.
i'm not going.
Stop calling me.
You're stressing me out!
No, he's not here yet.
No, i'm not drinking.
You can tell when people drink now?
i'll call when he gets here, ok.
No, i'll call.
A vodka, please.
Make that two.
i was worried but i knew you'd come.
My glass.
i'm sorry.
Forgive me.
Excuse me... Two more.
So...
Tell me.
What?
Why, one evening,
do you pick up a pen
to write so beautifully
to a total stranger.
i rarely go to the salon.
Once or twice perhaps.
And so briefly.
it's not easy.
Try.
For God's sake, what's she doing?
i remember as if it were yesterday...
i hadn't been at the salon long.
You came to see your daughter.
i was at reception
and heard your conversation.
it was a Tuesday.
March 1 7th.
She was wearing a black blouse
and you, a beige coat.
She put a green scarf
around your neck.
You didn't want it.
it wasn't your style.
But she said you dressed like that
when she was a little girl.
You were full of audacity and fantasy.
You replied,
"To charm your father.
"i did all i could
to seem eccentric to him."
She looked at you
and she told you
you were magnificent all the same.
When you left,
the scarf was on the coat stand.
i still have it.
There.
That's when i fell in love.
That's beautiful.
You could answer, dammit!
After all i've done for you!
i'm not asking much.
is it going well?
Or are you slumped over some bar?
Shit!
Thank you, Maddy,
for a lovely evening.
Thank you, Jean.
Good night.
Shit...
About time!
Sorry, it wasn't easy.
i wasn't alone.
Well?
How did it go?
Oh, sweetheart...
it was a wonderful moment.
We laughed,
we drank...
So i hear.
He kissed me.
Without warning.
He left his shell and...
On the hood of a car!
Surprising for such a reserved guy.
i make him happy.
And that...
That's wonderful.
i can help him.
He doesn't have much self-confidence.
Your father was the same.
But now
after chatting and listening
for just a few hours,
he seems to be...
illuminated.
Mum, don't get carried away, ok.
Give me a good reason not to!
Shit!
Can't think of one.
it was such a marvellous moment...
Mum, i'm tired.
Let's talk tomorrow.
i only liked his first letter...
You said that?
it made him smile.
Anyhow,
i was trying to remember the end
but then
he corrected me
and recited the whole end.
What do you mean?
He recited it to you?
He knew the final words by heart.
Of the letter?
He knew them?
He was so moved.
He closed his eyes
and he said,
"You're beautiful, perplexing
"never disappointing.
"i'll never possess you,
"i'm inconsolable."
Mum...
i have to go now.
i feel wiped out.
Robin...
Hi, Jean.
Jean...
Hello.
i thought you must have...
left us once again.
Not at all.
Believe it or not,
given urgent requirements,
the company has rehired me.
With new tasks and higher pay.
What do you do now?
Nothing.
Shit...
Here.
thank you.
You're welcome.
Sorry.
May i have a word?
Jean's here, blind drunk.
He's been hired to do nothing?
He's here?
is it true?
i rehired him, yes.
We haven't clearly defined
his new role yet.
Really?
He just gave me two bills.
One for dinner for two
and one for booze.
What does he do? Drink and eat?
Don't be hard on him.
He has problems.
i'm being hard on you, not him!
Look,
i turned down a top salon for you.
if this goes on, i'm pulling out.
Buy back my shares.
i can't afford to!
i know. So stop screwing up!
i'll talk to him.
i'm sorry.
it'd be easier if we'd opened a bar.
Can i have a word?
Maybe i can fit you in later.
Just before my nap.
Are you crazy?
You can't act like this.
i think i can.
You're not like this.
i know.
i adapt.
What is it you want?
i don't know.
it's hard to know
when you can ask for anything.
You know what?
Tell me.
What interests me now is seeing
how far i can go.
Not much further.
Really?
Let's make it easy.
By 3, change pavements.
One...
Two...
What is it?
You're a martyr
because you dined with my mother?
But she's happy, she sings.
You've saved her.
People give blood to save others.
Or a kidney.
You gave 3 hours
and a lousy kiss!
How can anyone be this crazy?
You want a medal now?
Sweetheart!
Why are you here?
Make me pretty for dinner...
At home.
You can't keep coming here.
He works here!
i'm a customer.
Paulette can do me.
Does He know?
What?
That dinner's at your place.
Yes.
Whose idea?
Mine.
Give him room to breathe.
Why?
He just can't say no.
You'll scare him off.
You can't understand.
Paulette's busy.
i'll go to Body Center.
They do free tanning too.
Just warning you.
When i'm unhappy, you pester me.
Now you destroy me.
What are you after?
i don't want you to suffer.
Have you seen him? Look at me.
He's 20 years younger.
i'm bound to suffer.
i'll enjoy it now.
Stop this, you're killing me.
i'm sorry, Mum.
Ask Paulette to do you.
She never has lunch.
She'll be glad to.
thank you.
Goodbye.
is this the key to open the till?
The boss said this is my advance.
Jean just took 600 euros.
You're kidding?
One of his new privileges?
Where is he?
No idea.
i don't know
what you two are playing at.
i'm going for lunch.
When i get back,
i want this sorted out or...
i'm leaving.
Jean!
i need a word.
Me too.
Got another? Feathers make me sneeze.
it's important.
i'm out to lunch.
Please.
Could you put the 600 euros back?
No way.
i've decided that's my new rate.
200 euros to do dinner,
400 for the night.
You cost a bomb!
Are you worth it?
Ask her.
No need.
i'm going to see her.
To tell her.
Enough of this.
The cost is too high?
i hate what she's becoming.
And i hate what you're becoming.
Someone...
unpleasant, curt, cynical...
When you're the opposite.
You're...
i'm?
Someone nice,
kind,
and concerned.
Sincere, generous...
Discreet...
Dignified, handsome...
Handsome?
Yes, you're handsome.
My mother saw that first.
She can see the beauty in people.
And inspire them.
That's why she's spent her life
as a muse while i do
hair and make-up.
So you're free for the evening.
Unless, of course,
you want to go.
i'll take that money back then.
Of course.
Here you are.
What will you tell her?
The truth.
That it's all my fault.
That i asked you to play a part,
that you never wrote those letters.
That i wrote them all.
Except the first one, of course.
That remains something...
sent to me by a stranger.
Even if, apparently,
you know it by heart.
i won't be able to keep you.
i realize that.
it's terrible.
You'll find a replacement.
A good electrician
is so hard to find nowadays.
i'm no genius.
Even an average one.
it's impossible.
True.
Especially this cheap.
i truly hope you make it.
The salon deserves it.
i've been thinking
but see no other solution.
Goodbye, Jean.
Goodbye, Emilie.
Stop off to see Sylvia on Friday
for your compensation.
There's no need.
i'm leaving tomorrow.
So soon?
it's for the best.
Are you going far?
i don't know.
Paris maybe.
Good luck then.
i'm sorry for all the harm
i may have done you.
if you pass by here
ever again,
come in and see us.
i'll do that.
We can forget the waxing, if you want.
it doesn't seem so urgent now.
Why let me tell you if you knew?
The traitor's view is interesting.
How could i inspire such mediocrity?
You were sad.
Now i'm humiliated.
Your father was right.
He always said,
"Emilie is loving and generous
"but two-faced.
"She'd break your leg
to make you dance her way."
Nastiness doesn't suit you.
i've become that way.
Thanks to you two.
it's not his fault.
i forced him.
He's upstanding,
he's impartial.
impartial?
it was hard for him.
it was...
Please go now.
Go!
Get out!
What's up?
The candles are melting.
Sorry?
Our dinner. Remember?
Never on time.
Hurry! i've worked so hard on it.
i've done sea bass. Do you like it?
i forgot the champagne.
if you can find a bottle...
Emilie, it's Jean.
My third call. i suppose
you'd rather not speak to me.
i'm going to tell your mother
what you couldn't.
Leaving you was hard.
Losing you is terrible.
Goodbye. For good.
For a second,
i was afraid
you were making me suffer.
You won't, will you?
No, Maddy.
Good.
You seem tired.
A tough day.
Yes, Emilie said it was very busy.
you saw her?
She brought Me chocolates.
And...
And some perfume.
Like it?
She left an envelope for you.
She gave you this envelope?
Like that. Without a message?
No, nothing.
You seem to be out of sorts.
if i can help, tell me.
i can't stand seeing you so sad.
Sadness in people like you,
good, honest people,
always seems so scandalous.
it's nothing. it'll pass.
Really?
i'm going to tell your mother
what you couldn't.
Leaving you was hard.
Losing you is terrible.
Goodbye. For good.
Why don't you touch me?
Afraid i'll be shocked?
Just my arm.
That's not a caress,
that's a comfort.
Sop teasing me.
Why? i love teasing you.
Another vodka. Fancy one?
i fancy everything.
Tonight, i'll stop being nice.
You're irresistible like this.
Like what?
Like this.
With four vodkas under my belt.
i'm flattered.
Like this, with your hair tousled...
your shirt slightly undone...
your rapid breathing...
i'm leaving.
i have a translating job.
With Samsung.
For their manuals.
Thrilling...
i leave tomorrow.
We have countless hours ahead of us.
What is it?
How can someone like you
have a daughter like her?
She's so...
Don't criticize her, please.
You...
You're so free...
Don't praise me, please.
i'll stop talking then.
is Emilie here?
Tell her i stopped by.
i haven't been able to reach her
for weeks now.
is she well?
She's ok.
i told Sylvia
to tell her i missed her.
Did she do that?
i don't know.
Could you tell her i'm well.
Tell her that if i'm happy now,
it's thanks to her.
Tell her anger brought me back to life.
That the anger has gone
and that life goes on.
She's gone.
What did she say?
That she's well.
And that if she's happy now,
it's thanks to you.
Anger brought her back to life
but the anger has gone
and life goes on.
Maddy, it's me.
i'd love you to be there
at my opening.
Emilie has promised to come too.
Take care.
Jean...
i needed a long time
before daring to write to you
and to tell you
how much i miss you.
i don't have your words.
i realize that already.
i only have the fear of losing you.
i love this fear and cling to it
for it alone gives me the strength
to tell you
that i'll be in Paris on Saturday
at the Bonnard Gallery.
i'll wait until the evening,
hoping that you'll let me reveal
my sincere, feverish
and anonymous feelings.
Did you write this?
Who else?
Really?
Truth counts in a relationship.
it's fundamental.
i work with Mr isaac.
He's an artist
and feels you embody
the very image of vitality.
He would like to work with you.
Would you agree?
Rise up.
Show joy.
Fly with joy.
Smile.
Smile and fly.
Back down now.
Gently.
Very good.
