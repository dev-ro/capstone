Looking at the farside with hope
I have no regret.
I will go over all barriers
and express my life in a song,
feeling proud of myself.
I'm all alone, but I don't bend any rule.
I'm with energy,
hoping for break through.
I am what I am.
singing my song,
letting the world to know all about me
Give me a hand here.
How is he?
Get him out of the water first.
Gator! Gator!
Gator's dead.
We're in Hong Kong.
When we were at sea with San Po.
We had everything.
Now, we're washed up here like driftwood.
Who did all this to us?
Dragon Ma
I'll rip you into pieces.
Right, let's all make a solemn oath.
We're all agreed, Dragon Ma must die.
Good morning, Mr Chun.
This way.
Morning.
Please sit inside.
The usual?
Yes.
Yes, thank you.
The bill.
Bill, please.
They're prepared to go to jail.
Their families will be compensated.
The bill please.
And the reporters?
They're upstairs.
We're ready when you are.
Let's order some food.
The stuff's upstairs, I'll get it for you.
Please wait here.
Help yourself.
OK.
Don't move! This is a stick up!
Don't move!
No!
My money!
Don't move!
Don't move!
It's time to leave.
Go and check.
Police, hold it!
Sir!
Take them away.
Yes, sir...
Go check out the shop.
Mr Chun.
Chan Jim.
We're reporters.
You're everywhere.
We'll take a photo.
Come on.
Not for me.
You caught the men so easily.
Were you acting on a tip off?
No, I was just on my beat as usual.
Mr Chun, do you mind being called
Lightening Chun?
To tell the truth I'm very flattered.
What are you charging them with?
Robbery and assaulting an officer.
Let's take a photo. Stand closer.
Grab his neck.
Sir! The shop owner is dead.
They should be charged with murder.
I agree with you.
What?
Bring them back.
We just did what you told us!
We didn't murder him!
Lock them up!
Stop there.
I only got $300! You promised...
No...
You!
They were escaping. Take away the bodies!
Yes, sir...
Mr Chun, over here.
May I have an explanation?
We all knew that Chun has been
staging his arrests.
Now the public's aware of it, too.
If you hadn't pushed him so much
he wouldn't have had to falsify his arrests.
You gave him three districts!
Chun is the only Chinese policeman
who can carry a gun.
I knew that would happen.
I'm against them carrying weapons.
Are you against paying them, too?
The situation should dictate which
officer carries a weapon
not the officer's nationality.
And they should be paid the same, too.
We'll address that another time.
Let's concentrate on Chun here.
He's responsible for three districts.
It's not easy to sack him.
We'll ease him out slowly
starting with Sai Wan district.
But who'll replace him?
I have a man in mind.
The man who carried out Project A
so successfully.
Start!
Turn Around!
Left.
Attention!
Take them back!
Yes, sir...
Fall in.
Sir, but I'm not qualified.
No one knows that and it's worth a try.
It'll be a change of scenery for you.
Yes, sir...
Go.
This is for your outstanding service.
Congratulations!
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
We'd also like to relieve you
of some pressure.
That's not necessary.
We don't want our top officer overburdened.
Yes.
So we're handing over one of
your districts to a new man.
We've received some new guns.
Your gun's been in service a long time.
I want to have it checked.
See if you need a new one.
Yes, sir...
Reporting for duty, sir.
Dragon, now you're Chun's assistant
in Sai Wan district.
These are your official orders.
Thank you, sir.
From now on, you and Chun
will work together.
If you've got any questions, ask him.
Yes, sir
It's an honour to work with you.
Welcome, I'm quite sure you'll be
a valuable addition to the district.
Let me know if you need anything.
Thank you sir.
Chun, you may have lost one district
but the Commissioner
will see you gain another.
Really?
Tai Hou Wan, a developing area.
I see. I see.
The corrupt Manchurian Government
has made our country poor.
We have become an inferior race.
If we want to save China, we have to
have the right attitude.
To enjoy a decent standard of living
we have to overthrow the Government.
Dr Sun set up the ''Revive China Society''
to support the revolution.
China cannot be saved by speeches alone we need action.
We need weapons and the money to buy them.
Police.
Thank you for listening.
Would you like to buy a flower?
Let's go.
Maggie!
Regina!
Stop here.
Where have you been?
Were you looking for me?
Not really. Where are you going?
Sai Wan.
Hop in.
Ok.
My cousin, Carina
my classmate, Regina.
Haven't seen you before.
She's just arrived from the mainland.
Really?
I'm having a party next week.
You're invited.
Is it your birthday party?
They're always such fun.
Carina, please come too!
Will you come?
What will I wear?
She'll lend you something.
Sure.
Support the revolution and buy a flower.
No, thank you.
Can I have one?
If he wants to save China, give me one, too.
OK.
Good idea. I'll have one, too.
Thank you, sirs.
You're right. I'll have one, too.
How much?
Sir, the revolution will succeed
if everyone was like you.
Yes.
Thank you.
Where do you usually sell these?
Wherever there are people to buy them.
Come on, eat.
What is it?
The police, hide the boxes.
You're spreading rumours disturbing the peace
and racketeering, right?
You have no proof.
The flowers you have are the proof.
And look at the flowers you sold.
You men are my witnesses.
Did this woman sell you the flowers?
No.
What's that?! What the hell are you doing
with flowers in your jackets?
We're pen pals meeting for the first time
and as we don't know each other
the girls said they'd hold baskets
and we said we'd wear a rose.
We didn't see you there! You should
hold them higher.
Come on, sit down.
You look much prettier than your
handwriting.
Let me introduce everyone
Mr A. I'm Mr B.
Mr C. Mr D. Sit down.
Sit.
Is it an offence to meet pen pals?
I must admit you won this time.
Watch out. Don't let me catch you
selling flowers.
And we're not used to making
idle threats either.
Some tea, miss?
I hate those who oppress us on behalf of
their foreign masters.
Right. They think they're wonderful
under that uniform.
They're morons. Don't you agree?
Not really.
There are cops who are honest
and hardworking.
I've never met any.
Yes, you have!
We're all policemen. We've never
oppressed anyone.
So all of you are policemen.
Excuse us.
Miss, China depends on patriots like you.
Don't forget your money boxes.
Dragon, if they weren't so beautiful
do you think you'd have helped them?
Cheque, waiter.
Yes, sir.
Those policemen were really kind.
If it wasn't for them, we'd have been
in trouble.
There aren't any good policemen.
How many did you sell?
Quite a few.
It's your lucky day.
And you?
Not much.
Help!
Help!
Come back!
So it's you again.
What's happened?
They tried to rob those ladies.
Come on, make way.
Really? What ladies?
Make way. Come on.
Don't block our way. Move along.
Strange, where did they go?
Officer, what's up?
Nothing.
Bring them back to the station!
You can tell me what this is all about.
I'd like to see the man in charge.
He's talking.
Sir
What?
We work for Tiger.
That's right.
Still, that's no excuse.
That's right.
But we didn't rob those ladies.
Really? How did you know they were ladies?
Be quiet! Who asked you?
Look, is Sergeant Chi here?
Sergeant Chi?
You lost. Do I place the same bet again?
Make it a dollar.
Really?
Yeah. Wait, they want to see Sergeant Chi.
This way.
Right, you lot, sign here.
You shouldn't be messing things up like that!
We didn't, sir.
Bullshit.
201, show these two out.
Get out of here.
Can I speak now?
What do you want to say? Go ahead.
I want to see your superior.
Why?
I want to report some police irregularities.
Ok.
All right. Shang, take them
to the back room.
Wait! One at a time.
You come with me.
Sung!
Coming.
So where is he?
Our superior is right here.
Now what's this about police
irregularities?
You can tell him.
You didn't expect your little show
earlier today would go unpunished?
I'm going to teach you a lesson.
No, help me.
Don't. Don't do that.
Don't.
Don't.
Don't do that. Stay right there. I'm the
new superintendent for Sai Wan.
Here's my appointment.
Superintendent, a terrible mistake.
If police officers believe
they can use their power
for personal attacks
and use their position to protect criminals...
that's also a mistake.
Sir, you mustn't believe that.
I just saw it with my own eyes.
Who do you think you are?
If this is the way it's going to bethen I'm quitting.
Right, you can do all our jobs.
So you've never made a mistake?
You really want everyone here to quit?
All right, I quit!
What has got into you boys?
He's saying it's for your own good.
Please, don't take any notice of them.
If every officer does his duty
then I'll ignore what happened.
It's dawn now.
Attention!
Welcome, Superintendent Ma!
A little welcome present for you, sir.
From all the boys?
Yes, sir.
So Sai Wan is a good place to make money.
Just to show our appreciation.
But there's one constable who refused to
show his appreciation.
Who's that?
Constable Ho, he's still out on the beat.
Send him in when he returns.
Yes, sir. Let me know if you need anything.
All right.
Sir, that's a lovely flower you have.
Thank you.
Look. He's been on the wanted list
for three years!
He's the suspect for many recent cases.
He still lives in Sai Wan.
He's down as a suspect here.
So why haven't they arrested him?
Maybe they didn't want to.
Superintendent. Constable Ho, sir.
You didn't contribute. Why?
As I don't take bribes.
I couldn't afford to.
So the others take bribes, then?
I didn't say that.
If you don't wise up, you won't stay in
your job long.
My job is to serve the people and
uphold the law.
I'd rather quit than accept bribes.
You sound like an honest man.
Tell me about all these unsolved
cases where no one's been arrested.
Tiger Au's the kingpin around here.
I'd love to arrest him.
But I don't have the power.
He's got lots of guards.
These criminals are his men.
So where does he hang around?
He runs most of the illegal businesses
in Sai Wan.
He's usually at Po Luk Hotel.
Tell the other officers to come in
early tomorrow.
Yes, sir
Attention!
All right, as long as each of you
does your duty
I'll be happy.
I don't need envelopes.
Would you like to live near a brothel?
Or see your own children gamble
or smoke opium
knowing the damage they do to the family?
You wouldn't like it and neither
would Sai Wan residents.
But brothels, gambling and opium dens
exist everywhere
and you all know who owns them.
It is our duty to protect this community
and I intend to do it.
Therefore starting today
we're going to clean it up.
Yes, sir...
Attention!
Let's go.
Superintendent, if you've enough men
I'll stay here.
Can I have a day off?
Why?
Can I have a day off, too?
Tell me why. One by one.
My wife's pregnant.
My sister's pregnant.
What a coincidence!
My sister is his wife.
My wife is his sister.
Yeah.
Sir, can I resign now?
For what reason?
I'm the only child in my family.
So I'd rather not go.
You go yourself.
Me, too.
For what I'm paid, it isn't worth the risk so I quit.
I quit, too.
Me, as well.
I quit, too.
All right, operation cancelled.
Dismissed.
But Dragon...
Come on.
Now you see why I'm so fed up.
They never want to do any real work.
They made Dragon cancel his plan.
What do you mean?
There are good reasons for that.
Maybe he wants someone
to check Tiger out first.
No. He's testing the men to see
who's brave and who's a coward.
Now he knows he can't trust anyone.
Am I right?
He's right. We've been with Dragon
so long now
we know how his mind works.
Oh, really? Right now it's not working.
Are you kidding?!
If this operation fails, we'll have to
leave this place.
He's right. We can't fail or
we're finished.
Mars, I want you to take a note
to the marines.
Yes.
You're asking for a transfer back?!
We'll go and arrest Tiger tonight.
Yes, sir.
Well, it's been ages since we were
all together.
To your health.
Tiger, I hear you have a small job
for us.
That's right. I just met Chun.
His Sai Wan district has been given to
some new upstart.
We'll wait for Mars here.
You go check the place out.
Thank you.
We've changed clothes
why are they staring?
Your hat's on backwards.
How about now?
That will do.
What's this for?
Here.
Forget that. Let's get something
to eat first.
Tiger, if we've lost Chun's protection
who'll look after our interests?
Since he's asking for a favour
we have to help him no matter what.
As soon as this new guy
shows his face around these parts
we'll fix him permanently.
Why wait for him to come out?
Go fix him at the station.
Who is he anyway? Is he some kind of
monster or what?
Mars, over here.
I spoke to Ying.
She said the marines were
off training somewhere.
Is the operation still on?
We'll do it on our own.
We can't back down now.
Not much happening.
What did you say his name was?
Dragon Ma.
Dragon Ma?
Remember the one that killed
the pirates?
Which one of you is Tiger?
I am.
In that case, you're coming down
to the station.
To the station? Who are you?
Superintendent Dragon Ma.
You're wanted in connection
with 3 murders. 4 robberies.
one case of arson and 3 of assault.
This is the warrant.
I did all those things?
Let me see that.
Sorry, I missed.
Dragon, are we leaving?
Stop the music.
Stop it.
All right, we're police officers.
If you've no business here, out!
Time to go.
Come on, everybody.
Come on.
Dragon Ma.
Nice of you to drop by.
I wanted to meet you.
You must be after me.
Those two Causeway Bay murders I did both of them.
You'd better arrest me, too, because
I'm going to kill a policeman soon.
Dragon Ma, didn't anyone tell you?
You're dead.
One day I'll die for sure like
everybody else.
In the meantime, you're under arrest.
Dragon!
Dragon! The third unit are outside
awaiting orders.
Dragon!
The other two units are all in position.
All ready.
No one told me about this.
What?
Don't just stand there. Get them in here.
Go.
Yes.
I'll tell them to charge.
They're all ready.
Forget it. No more bluffing
we're all alone.
You've got courage.
You shouldn't be worried about
arresting anyone
You should be more worried about
getting out of here alive
The doors.
Right.
Steady.
Steady.
Get out of here!
Steady.
What do we do now?
Now...
Get them!
Look out!
The back!
Bastard! Let me teach you a good lesson.
Arrest me?!
You'd need more lives than a cat
to arrest me.
You four kneel down.
Go get him!
Had enough yet?
Don't forget my name is Wong.
Forward!
Upright!
Spread out!
Dragon, are you all right?
Upright!
Dragon, what a surprise! I see you're
hard at work.
Yes, sir...
How's it going?
They were resisting arrest.
Really? I see, take them away.
Hold it.
What? Are we pirates? Are we smugglers?
This is dry land, you can't
arrest us here!
I realise that, sir.
But I suspect there are pirates
in this hotel.
Superintendent, please carry on I wouldn't want to interrupt you.
Yes, sir.
Lock them up.
Yes, sir.
Round them up, take them back to the base
and question them to see if they are pirates.
Yes, sir...
You. You. Round them up.
Take them back to the base!
Fall in.
Yes, sir...
Right. Go.
Quick.
Take them away.
Are you all right?
You could have come quicker.
Move it.
Come on.
Thank you. I owe you one.
They were out at sea.
They came as soon as they got
the message.
Dragon Ma! If it wasn't...
Shut up!
Hold it!
Release these two.
If you two manage to walk out of
this place
you can go free.
Right, leave us.
Lock them up!
You're still the same.
Sorry, sir.
If police work was that easy
I'd have taken your job long ago.
I know, sir.
Just remember, you're still one of us.
We must go fishing again.
Yes, sir...
Dragon, Father says things are
very different on land
especially here.
You have to be careful.
Take them back to the station.
Yes, sir...
Move it! Go on!
How was it?
It's Dragon Ma for sure.
Yes.
Let's kill him!
Let's do it.
How?
They've got an entire army out there.
The police were looking for pirates.
Right?
See? They've already got wind
of our plan.
What do we do now?
We can go to bed early.
Where do we sleep?
Where do we sleep?
We can't kill him now, so we'll
find a hotel.
We have to wait.
You're here.
Yes.
Cigarette?
No, thanks.
Chun, are you taking those files?
I was going to.
But I'll need them when I'm back.
Really?
When will you be back?
I believe it will be soon.
Not everyone can sit in this chair.
You're right, sir.
Find a place to store them.
He'll be back soon.
Right.
Sergeant, could you...?
Dragon Ma! I've always wanted to arrest
these gangsters
and now you've done it.
This is terrific.
It's the right choice to choose you.
Thanks.
Shut up!
What do you mean?
Lock them up.
You've changed your tune.
Take them away.
Chun!
Shut up!
Do you hear me?! Take them away!
Do you hear me?! Take them away!
Upright!
Put Tiger in the security block.
Yes, sir...
267. 357
Sir
Put Wong here in cell two.
Yes, sir...
282, take some men and seal off
the hotel.
Yes, sir...
Sergeant Ching.
Sir
Lock up the rest of this rabble
and take their statements.
Yes, sir...
The rest start working on the wanted criminals.
Understood?
Yes, sir...
Get to work.
Yes, sir...
Get going!
You've been working very hard.
Take a break.
Thank you sir
Sir, you put your feet up.
I'll make you a nice cup of coffee.
These files, where do I put them?
Idiot! Put them away.
Dragon, the Commissioner is extremely
pleased with the way the raid went.
Thank you sir
Don't thank me.
And we can't give you any medals yet.
Remember, don't get carried away.
No. I won't, sir.
I'm here to make sure you don't.
Yes, sir...
Keep your eyes peeled at the
Commissioner's daughter's party.
I'll be on the alert.
That's not good enough.
You must anticipate Chun's every move
to cause trouble.
If anything goes wrong, you'll be blamed.
Thanks for the advice, sir.
You'd better get something smart
to wear.
You and your men need new clothes.
This ought to cover things.
Thank you, sir
This rat won't even feed one of us.
Where are you going?
To rob a shop.
I want to eat proper food, not rats.
We've got nothing to lose.
That's true.
But we've come to kill Ma.
If we go out, we'll be arrested
in a matter of minutes.
then we'll never avenge the death
of our captain.
Shall I make rat soup?
I haven't eaten meat soup for ages.
Guys, I've talked to Chun.
I've agreed to steal a necklace
at the birthday party.
I don't get it.
We're not doing this for Chun.
We are doing this for the revolution.
He'll pay good money and we can
use it for weapons.
Does Chun know your background?
He knows I smuggle weapons.
But he thinks I'm a thief.
That's great. I think we should
give it a try.
By the way, before I left Canton
Dr Sun gave me a warning.
After the murder of the
governor of Canton
the dowager empress sent secret agents
to arrest us.
Tell Maggie and Carina to be careful
selling flowers.
Dismissed.
Come with me.
I found it.
What did you find?
Fish and lobster.
Really?
It's a lobster's shell.
Only the shell.
Well, that's ok.
What did you find out?
Normally...they're spread out
all over the city.
It's hard to know where they are.
But Carina's often seen around here
when she sells flowers.
We could start with her.
This time we must liquidate all of them.
Yes, sir...
It's beautiful!
I feel stupid dressed like this.
Don't be silly.
But I do.
We'll change inside.
It's Mr B.
The invitation's for one person only.
It says here one person.
But can't she come with me, please?
Sure. I don't think that will be
a problem.
Maggie. You finally turned up.
You're late.
We've been waiting you for long.
Come on!
Why are you late?
You go first.
Make it quick.
Come on, let's find you some dresses.
That gentleman wouldn't let my cousin in
without an invitation.
And who are you?
We're policemen. We're here for security.
And what's your name?
This is Dragon Ma.
Dragon, I forgot to give her
the invitation.
may she come in?
Of course.
Thanks
Thank you!
Come on.
Sorry.
Don't worry.
Tell Mars to keep an eye on them.
Yes, sir...
Who are they?
The man's called Man. I don't know
the woman's name.
Beware of strangers.
Thank you.
She's very pretty. Do you know
who she is?
I've no idea, sir.
So no one can introduce me then?
I'll introduce her to you, sir.
She's not a friend of yours?
Are you ready?
Go ahead.
This way.
This way. The necklace is in the
office behind the painting.
Breathe in. That should do it.
Nearly.
This dress is very tight.
They're all like that.
Get the back.
Don't move.
That's ok.
What do you think?
Lovely!
So you were brought up in Shanghai
but you don't have an accent.
Maybe I don't, but you don't have to
have athlete's foot to be an athlete.
Sorry.
Please.
Miss, you're really witty.
I like meeting people like you.
He says that to all the ladies.
Don't listen to him.
Your Excellency has found a
rare pearl indeed.
You look wonderful in this dress.
Better stay alert
Daddy, do I look pretty?
Absolutely lovely, my dear.
And what about the dress?
But I was talking about the dress.
Let me have the first dance. Come on.
Music.
Miss, may I have the pleasure
of this dance?
Go on. It'll be fun.
May I have this dance?
Daddy, are you happy?
Of course. You're very
beautiful tonight.
Why aren't you looking at me?
Where do you live?
James' Street.
It's a dangerous town, you must
be careful.
With policemen like you to catch
all the criminals, I feel quite safe.
Do you think Hong Kong is a
dangerous place to live?
Dangerous? Not really.
What do you do all day long?
Sit in my office and drink coffee.
When I leave the dance floor.
go upstairs with Carina
to distract the security guards.
Don't worry. We know what to do.
How can you say it's not dangerous
with all the crime?
If there wasn't any crime there wouldn't be any police.
Perhaps we could take tea together.
Excuse me, did you have garlic
for lunch?
The Commissioner's office is opposite
his daughter's bedroom.
I'll climb up outside.
Wait for me in her room.
Ok.
In my spare time, I go shopping
I go to theatre or I paint pictures.
You paint? I love painting.
What is it?
I've torn the dress.
What's up?
Let's go and fix it.
Excuse me.
Nobody has changed partners with us.
Don't you like my company?
Of course. But I have to use the ladies.
All right, let me show you where it is.
Thanks.
Right, let me fix it for you.
I can't see. Stop that.
It's really hot.
It's not.
You're right, open the window.
I'll do it.
The invitations are real.
but where did they get them from?
He's not dancing, do you think...
Tell me which one you like.
It's lovely.
Which one?
Be quiet.
What is it?
Nothing, you have a lovely figure.
Really? Thanks a lot.
What's going on, Carina?
Nothing.
Which one shall I wear?
Go!
I am sorry, I am so sorry.
Please.
Daddy, I was thinking about this one
for the cake. Is this pretty?
Why don't you ask my friend Miss Pak?
You look pretty in anything.
Thank you.
I liked the one you wore earlier.
Then maybe I'll put it back on.
These girls...
Sorry, sir
Have you seen...
I've seen nothing
but you've seen my daughter undressed.
Being in charge of security doesn't
mean you can charge in anywhere.
Out!
Sorry, sir.
Out!
Yes, sir...
He's out of his mind!
All right now, ladies.
Don't take too long.
My bedroom's here.
What does your bedroom look like?
Quick. They're waiting for me
for the cake.
Go.
Your room is huge!
I find it much too big since
my wife's death.
Please.
This is beautiful!
It's just a normal office for a
colonial service man.
I only own the paintings
all the rest belong to the Government.
So you can't give me a souvenir?
I just bought them. So they're
not framed.
May I see them?
If you'd like to, sure.
Of course. I bought this in London.
I liked it very much when I saw it.
I like it very much, too!
I'm sure you'll like the other one.
Let me get it for you.
Besides being a collector
do you paint?
Yes, I do. I paint sometimes.
But I'll be embarrassed to
show them to people.
And you? What do you like to paint most?
Chinese landscapes mostly.
Really? I love Chinese landscapes.
But I don't know much about them.
I have two more somewhere, but I can't
remember where I put them.
They're not here.
They might still be in the box.
Don't worry if you can't find them.
We've got time, the cake's not ready yet.
They're not here. Strange.
Maybe they haven't arrived yet.
Don't move!
Hold it!
What's going on?
What's going on?
Thief, sir.
What?
What are you doing?
There's been a theft!
Damn!
What a lovely cake!
It's so big.
It's beautiful.
I'm sorry.
What?
Don't move.
Sorry, everyone.
You are under arrest.
Why?
Me?
What? Dragon!
You can't deny it.
I saw you stealing something
in the study.
Somebody's stolen the necklace
I bought for Regina's birthday.
He's the one.
You're accusing me of stealing?
And the evidence?
You better search him.
He has a number of accomplices
I doubt he still has it on him.
Dragon, if you make accusations
you'd better be able to back them up.
Ladies and gentlemen, we don't like this
any more than you.
But to prove your innocence
I'm sure you won't mind a search
by one of my officers.
You want to search me?
If you're innocent, you won't mind.
Needless to say, you'll start with me.
However, to be fair
I think we should start with Mr Ma.
All right.
Chun, can you search him?
Chief, it's better if you do it.
Right, if you wish.
It's part of the diamond necklace.
Where did you get this?
Someone must have set him up.
Mr Ma really is a wonderful actor.
Ladies and gentlemen
this was all part of the
evening's entertainment.
However Mr Ma is such a good actor
he fooled everyone person.
I just hope everyone enjoyed it.
Daddy!
A surprise.
You almost scared me to death.
Let's have the cake.
You really arranged everything, sir?
Of course not. Where's the necklace?
I've no idea, sir.
Then what is this doing in your pocket?
I demand an explanation!
So it wasn't a game?
Did it look like a game to you?
No, I suppose it didn't. What now?
I should be asking that.
You're the policeman.
Yes, sir...
Arrest him.
But, sir...
Shut up! It's an order.
I expect you to get to the bottom
of this and quickly.
Yes, sir...
Take him away.
You have to make a wish.
All right.
Did you set Dragon up with
the necklace that night?
I don't know much about that.
but he's innocent.
He's a nice person.
We had to do it for the good
of the country, don't forget.
Hot dumplings!
Do you want some dumpling?
All right.
What do you want in them?
Carina.
Carina.
Carina. Where are you?
Carina.
Maggie, what's the matter?
My cousin has disappeared.
What?
She just disappeared in the thin air!
Suddenly disappeared?
She won't talk, but I found this.
Go to this address, see if
you find the others.
Yes, sir...
You must avoid the police.
Yes, sir...
You're in big trouble if the
Chief finds out.
Not if we find the necklace.
Why do you think Carina's involved?
She and Man were dancing all evening.
Sir! I have a release order here.
I'm allowed to take him out.
Is this your first day?
You've forgotten the handcuffs.
Sorry.
I'll keep this with me for safety.
Thank you sir
What's up?
We don't have to show everybody.
Let's go and see the warden.
Yes, sir...
All I want is for the prisoner to be
taken down the road towards the sea.
After that, you'll never
need to work again.
It's really that simple?
It's that simple.
It's a deal.
Anyone here?
With any luck, she'll be back by now.
Be quiet!
Carina. Carina!
Carina.
Oh, no. I can't find her anywhere.
I wonder who kidnapped her.
Sometimes it's better not to know.
It's her!
You two again.
Right.
Any news of Carina?
She's not back yet. And you?
We're still working on it.
Hold on, I'll finish changing.
Who is it?
Dragon and his man.
It's about the necklace.
I'd better hide.
Any ideas?
It's linked to the necklace case.
That's right.
That's right.
Are you involved?
That's what the Commissioner
told us to say.
Does your cousin know a Mr Man?
No, she doesn't.
Sit down, please.
We're like brothers.
Yeah.
Do you need to go the bathroom?
No.
But you said you needed to.
When?
Yeah, I did say that.
Where's the bathroom?
The bathroom?! Over there.
Thanks.
I only have one bathroom.
We always go together.
Yeah, since we were kids.
Thanks.
All clear?
They're in the bathroom.
All right. I'm leaving now.
Good morning.
Excuse me, I'm just getting changed.
Chief Inspector Tung is here!
What's he doing here?
Keep him talking, I'll be in the back.
Chief Inspector Tung?
Chief Inspector Tung
For you
Thanks.
Can I help you with anything?
I was just passing by.
And the flowers?
I confiscated them from a hawker.
I must say you've got a
very pleasant place here
so bright and airy
and beautifully decorated.
Oh, yes, your two officers are right...
My two officers what?
My two officers are what?
Where are your officers?
They're all downstairs waiting for me.
I'll patrol around this area everyday.
Just in case.
What is it?
Are you all right?
Indigestion.
It's hiccups. I have a cure.
Does it work?
It's a very ancient remedy.
You're cured. It always works.
Are you better now?
Yes. I am.
If you have hiccups again you know what to do.
I was wondering...
Why don't we put them in a vase?
Yeah? Sure!
Let me help you.
Where's the water tap?
Behind you.
Normally
I close this window when I'm cooking.
Are you cooking now?
No, I'm not cooking now, I may
as well leave it open.
You've got a problem here but I can fix it.
Thanks.
Don't move!
It won't hurt, it's just a little water.
Stand back or you'll get wet.
It won't take too long.
I'll go and get a towel.
All right, the coast is clear.
I'm sorry. I fixed it but I got all wet.
Thank you. Wow...
Oh, it's nothing.
I was chief of waterworks before.
My uniform's wet.
I'll hang it up for you.
Thanks.
Enough heroics.
You're still here?!
There are lots of police downstairs.
Keys.
Quick! Hurry!
Maggie!
Where are you?
Finished!
Where will I put them?
In the living room.
Can you hang this out to dry
and lend me a shirt?
What's up?
It won't open.
Let me.
The humid weather makes the wood expand.
Hold this.
Try this side.
That's ok now.
I hope this will do.
It will have to.
Thank you.
I'll iron your jacket.
No, it can't be ironed. It must be
hang dried.
It's all right. I'm patient. I can wait.
That's what it was!
They're...
They're handcuffs. We use them
on prisoners.
When you arrest a criminal, you put
this end on his arm
and you put this end on your own arm so he can't escape.
When there are two thieves and one runs off.
then...
Lock him here and go find another one.
When you return, will he still be here?
He can't move, can't he?
I left my keys in my jacket.
I'll get them.
That must be your cousin.
It's Chun!
Really? Tell him I'm not here.
No! He's here to see me.
Tell him you're not here.
He's already seen me!
Why did I handcuff myself?
I must hide.
I need a hiding place.
I'm just changing.
Go over there.
All right, quickly.
Go that way!
This way.
Ow! That hurts!
Quick!
Where will I hide?
Under the bed.
All right.
This one here, it's safer.
All right, the sofa first.
You must get under the bed first.
All right, whatever you say.
Come on, hurry.
Don't move.
Sorry, I was just changing.
It's ok.
Chun, is this your beat now?
Yes, it is. Nice place you have here.
So, do you have any complaints
about the district?
Yes, a lot.
Really? What are they?
Well, it's becoming dangerous
around here.
Just last night...
Forget it.
Please, sit down.
Thanks.
I'll go and make some tea.
Thank you.
Oh, no. I've no hot water.
I'll get some drinks from the shop.
Don't worry.
Chun, do you visit everybody
as part of your police duties?
Yes, of course.
I'd better go.
Good idea.
Bye! Take care, Chun.
Don't forget if you're ever in the area
feel free to drop by.
Me?
You guys I mean...
If Chun's gone, I'd better go, too.
What are you doing?
I thought I'd give you a goodbye kiss.
No, you don't!
That was wonderful.
Hurry up now, or you'll be late.
You've had your kiss, now go.
When are you going?
Now. I promised to meet
some of my officers.
Well. OK?
No. There are two men up there.
Another two?
How did they all get in my house?
What now?
Come on, this way.
Where are the damn keys?
Who are the bravest cops in history?
The Hong Kong Police!
You should see the way we catch thieves!
Rain and hail and heat and typhoon
Nothing stops us, because we're
the toughest cops ever!
And who are the greatest people
in all Hong Kong?
It's our policemen
They don't need to catch any robbers
Because they're the crooks
They take bribes and get rehousing
Don't move!
Keep on! Keep on!
And Mr Tung, why do you
have a moustache?
Because I'm proud of myself
Who are you?
Let's get him!
What are you doing here?
Are you alone?
Go on, beat him up.
Stab him. Stab his heart.
Stab his thigh. Kick his ass.
Talk!
Keep on! Keep on!
Stop...
He's going to die! Is he dead?
Still breathing.
Tell us or I'll blow your head off.
Hold it! I've got two hostages.
Move and I'll shoot them both dead.
We have a hostage, too.
Choy, are you OK?
Sure, he might live.
OK, we'll exchange a hostage but no funny business.
Move it!
Choy, are you hurt?
Don't move an inch.
Are you Ok my dear Carina?
Go find the keys for me.
I was really worried about you.
I work for the dowager empress.
So what are you doing here, then?
I'm here to arrest rebels.
The Hong Kong police can't touch us.
We have different laws here.
And our laws apply to everyone
in Hong Kong, including you.
Will he obey the law though?
Lock him up along with this one here.
Send them back to Manchuria.
I can't find them, sir.
I know, let's shoot the lock off.
What if you hurt me?
Be accurate!
Lock them up first.
Go find them!
What about me? Look at me.
Be careful, sir.
Don't worry about me
just get Ma back to the prison.
I'll change my signature next time.
Upright!
Chief, your hand.
My hand's holding important evidence
which proves they're thieves.
Where are your keys? Open it.
Yes, sir.
I have the cuffs, but not the keys.
All right, I'll take them in.
Dragon, you're not free yet, you
have to be back in prison by sunset.
I'll take him back.
I can do that for you, sir.
Come on, let's go.
Move it.
You know what to do.
Yes, sir.
Out of the way! Stand back.
Dragon, you know the rules, don't you?
Yes, sir.
Sir.
can you take off the cuffs? I won't run away.
I don't have my keys with me.
Dragon Ma, you're a dead man!
Who are you?
We're victims of your heroism.
We'll kill you today.
I've nothing to do with this.
Get lost, then.
What about me?!
Good luck.
This is for Captain San po.
Yes.
My keys! My keys!
Stop there.
Do you know who he is?
I'm a superintendent.
We don't give a shit!
Hey, up here.
What?
I said up there.
I didn't hear you.
Come on, we've got to work together.
Higher.
Out of the way!
Not that way.
We're police!
Help, we're being attacked.
This way, come on.
We've got to jump.
Quick!
Stop!
Quick!
This way.
Open up. Open up.
What's happening?
Over here.
Over here, officer.
Over here.
Why did you hit me?
Try this.
Well...
Come on.
Go!
You are dead!
There's no way!
This way, come on.
Come on.
You almost got me killed!
This way.
You! Tell me who you are
or I'll kill you.
Help!
That hurts!
It's them.
They're officers!
Upright!
Get the men inside, hurry!
Police!
Kill!
There's many of them!
Run!
The bread!
Forget it!
But it's bread!
Bread?
They've gone.
Everyone back to the station.
What?! Go after them!
Where are you from, sir?
Shandong.
In all Shandong, there's no one...
...as tall as me?
No, as clumsy as you.
What's that?
Sorry sir
Let's go.
Once you're back in Canton you'd better keep a low profile.
There are spies everywhere.
I'll be careful.
I don't have much time.
Please give this to Maggie.
I hope when we meet again it will be in victory.
Sure.
Goodbye
Goodbye
It's Chun!
Hey, Superintendent.
Warden.
Nice to see you here.
Are you OK?
He almost got me killed.
Where are you going?
Back to my office.
Great, you can take him back to jail.
Have you got the keys?
Go find the others.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Goodbye, Dragon.
Goodbye.
Waiter, a cup of tea.
Yes, sir.
This isn't the way to the prison.
It's a short cut to another place.
Where?
Hell.
What?
Release me!
What are you trying to do?
Quick!
What's going on?
We'll say he fell in the water
if they ask.
Yes.
He doesn't look too good.
He's hungry.
How do you know?
Aren't you hungry?!
We all are.
His head's real hot.
He's got a fever.
This is all Dragon Ma's fault.
It's not Ma's fault.
it's all our own fault.
If I'd found us all proper jobs when
we landed instead of looking for Ma
we'd never have ended up like this.
You should have said that
from the start.
But he killed many of our brothers.
It's his job, he's a policeman
like it's our job
to kill people.
Why didn't you say that before?
Yeah!
Who cares? Let's see what's wrong
with him first.
Are you all right?
I'm hot and cold.
The hot and cold thing!
What?!
We've got to get some medicine.
Come on.
Thank you for letting my men go.
Is there anything else I can do?
I came here to capture some assassins.
Is our Government offering any help?
There's a reward of 5.000 taels
for each of them.
Chun, that will be brilliant.
It was you who saved my life.
If we didn't do what Chun asked.
you wouldn't have gone to jail.
We owed you one.
Why did you set me up?
We needed money to buy weapons so we did a deal with Chun.
Then we realised we'd helped him
set up a good cop.
Where's the necklace?
It's in the Commissioner's study inside one of his books.
You did save my life.
I guess I'll let it go this time.
Are you going?
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone
your secret.
That'll only help our revolution.
But you still worry us.
Really?
You still want to be a cop?
What else can I do?
Join us, the revolution.
If we had comrades like you
we'd have a better chance.
I won't join you.
Are you still angry about what we did?
You've got to bend the rules to
achieve a noble goal.
We're even prepared to sacrifice
our lives for the revolution.
That's exactly why I can't join.
There's no way I can bend the rules.
However noble the cause, I can't change.
As far as I'm concerned. I couldn't
break the law to achieve any goal.
However, I do admire you.
I think one day you'll succeed.
I understand that to overthrow the
Government, lots of people must die.
But I won't ask people to do that
because I don't know what will be
left once the sacrifices are over.
So I'll remain a policeman.
I think every life is precious and
I want everyone to have a happy life.
A country of 400,000,000 people
is made up of individuals.
If they hate their lives
how can they love their country?
I see what you mean.
I'll remember your words.
We're both working
for the people but in different ways.
So being a policeman is noble after all.
But they won't let any good policemen
exist in a colonial region.
They'll destroy you
I'm here to fight those people.
Take care.
Goodbye.
Uncle Koon, she only left me a letter.
Why did she leave in such a hurry?
Maybe it was urgent.
Thank you. I'm going. Goodbye.
OK, I'll go.
Give me that axe.
Let's hope this works.
Be nice.
Excuse me, brother.
I need some medicine, and
can I pay later?
Sorry, we don't do that here.
But a life is at stake.
We're not a charity.
If everybody was like you
we'd soon be out of business.
Give it to him.
Right.
But I'd like to know who you are
and what I did to offend you.
Perhaps I arrested your friends
by mistake before.
Wan, I'm going. You can put it on my slate.
My friend.
My friend.
What's wrong with your friend?
The hot and cold thing.
What?
It's probably typhoid.
Yes.
Keep quiet!
Uncle Koon, run!
Now you have a warrant no one will stop you.
This way please, sir.
Move along. This is police work.
Let's go.
Here he is.
Did you get it?
Yeah, look. I saw Dragon Ma, too.
Did you kill him?
No, he paid for the medicine.
They're all upstairs.
Uncle Koon, you first. See you later.
Keep it.
Come on.
It's Dragon Ma.
Why is he still alive?
Here, take this.
Be careful.
Mr Chun, is something wrong?
No, it's just an arrest.
But we heard gunshots.
None of your business, carry on.
Yes, sir...
Go.
Go on!
Yes, sir...
Move along.
Dragon Ma, you are lucky.
I think this is what you're looking for.
Chun, why the hell are doing this?
I'll tell you, you have your
conditions and I have mine.
Thank you.
This is the one.
Yan Kit, why did you betray us?
You bastard!
So what? I'm merely carrying out
my duty to arrest rebels.
What do you want?
Chun.
Yes, sir.
Your reward.
Thank you, sir.
And the others?
I'll take them back with me.
The boxes are ready, sir.
Damn you, Chun!
You were saying?
Do you know what you're doing?
What are you suggesting?
You won't get away with this.
Don't worry, I will get away with it.
What have you got against me?
You were against me from the start.
I've nothing against you personally
but you keep interfering.
And you had my men arrested.
The longer I let you live
the more problems you'll cause me.
I was just doing my job as a policeman.
You're a good cop, I'm a bad cop, so
we're never going to see eye to eye.
It's either you or me.
Do you understand?
That's enough. I'm not interested in
listening to your stories.
That's right. You'd better leave
before the night market starts.
But I don't want that man around.
Of course, I intend taking care
of him after you leave.
Get on with it.
Let's do it
Help!
Maggie.
Shut up!
She knows nothing.
Forget her. I have something
special in mind for you.
Take him away.
Yes, sir. Move!
Move!
Stop that!
Go!
Throw him in there.
Go help the others.
Yes, sir.
Yan kit, switch it on.
Don't think you can get out of there.
It's impossible.
This batch of soy sauce will be delicious.
Our company is famous for its sauce
and it's for export only.
Your flesh and blood will be in every bottle
all to be shipped overseas.
Isn't that wonderful?
Well?
You're doing fine.
Let's see how long you can keep it up.
I think we need to add a little oil.
A little more there.
He's escaped!
After him!
Run!
Get the notebook.
Come on, hurry.
Use the stairwell!
What's up?
It's a dead end.
Come on, this way.
Hurry! This way.
Quick!
Quick!
Come on!
Don't let them escape!
You'll have to climb down.
It's all right. Don't be afraid.
No.
Take the basket.
Come on.
Hold on.
Just do like I do. I'll go first.
I'll catch you on the ground.
Go on, jump!
You're safe. You can get off me.
Quick!
This way.
Come on.
Quick, but be careful.
Quick
Quick! Help her.
Help!
Try to find a foothold. Hurry up.
Give me your hand.
Come.
Don't come any closer.
Hold on tight!
Jump, I'll catch you.
No. Wait a minute, I'll get a board.
Go on, jump!
Let go! Come on!
Take the notebook.
You keep that. I can't make it.
Take the notebook and leave here.
We can't escape.
Go.
Keep an eye on those two.
Yes
Block the exit.
Dragon Ma?!
Give us the notebook.
I've eaten it.
Give it back and we'll let you go.
If I'd wanted to go, I'd be gone.
Enough talk!
We'll give you one more chance.
No thanks. I don't need any more.
Get him!
It's fits me.
Get going.
How do I look?
Get going.
Come.
Luck is on my side.
Really?
Get the notebook.
Have you got it?
What are you doing?
Why did you hit him?
Get him!
You go that way.
Go back!
Go and block his exit.
Yes, sir.
Dragon Ma is not our friend.
But if you lay a finger on him we won't be very happy.
Hit him!
Hit!
Don't worry, I'll handle this.
Chief. Mr Chun has the situation covered.
Hold it!
It's the warden.
Bastards!
Come with me.
Excuse me, I have an appointment.
Out of the way!
Hold it. Chun!
Here's your money.
Don't pull the rope or the whole thing
will come down.
Look out, it's falling.
Get out of the way!
Make sure Dragon's all right.
Thank you, Mercial Goddess.
He's all right!
Chun's under there!
Let my men go free.
Why?
I'm a representative of
the Ching Government.
My men were acting in self defence.
They must be allowed to leave.
What did you say?
What? Who are you?
You...
You hear what he said?
Not a thing.
What again?
He got accent.
That's just what I thought.
Dragon, are you all right?
Yes, sir.
You're finished!
Let them go.
Thank you.
No need, I owe you one.
Dragon, what's going on here?
Dragon Ma.
Do you remember why we came here?
Yes, we do.
Kill.
He's dead. Let's go.
Dragon, who are they?
Just some friends.
You didn't introduce us.
That's because I don't know them.
Dismissed!
Yes, sir...
Dismissed!
