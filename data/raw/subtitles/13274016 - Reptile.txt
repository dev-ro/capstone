Did they say if they have kids?
[woman] I didn't ask.
Shit!
[man sighs]
[woman] Will, what is this?
Ehh, it's probably a rat.
Whatever it is, it's long gone.
The pool's a fucking mess.
Looks like a swamp.
[tense music playing]
- [distant church bell tolling]
- [chuckles]
- Stop.
- What's wrong?
[Will sighs]
You know, you used to love
to fool around in the nice ones.
["Angel of the Morning" resumes]
Is this one above my pay grade?
[woman] I'm in the middle
of a dark tunnel,
and my car dies on me.
So, I'm sitting there alone
and looking for a flashlight,
but then I hear a train coming towards me,
but I can't see it.
So, I started feeling for the keys to turn
the battery on and flash the lights,
but they were gone.
And I could hear the train
speeding towards me,
and I went to get out, but I couldn't.
- I couldn't move. I just froze.
- And then what?
[woman] That's it.
What do you think it means?
[sighs] Maybe you're afraid
of getting caught.

[woman] Hi.
This is Summer Elswick of Grady Real...
[phone clicks]
[Will] What's the secret to survival?
And how did we survive
when so many others didn't?
- Mm-hm?
- I'll tell you the secret.
But first, I'm going to need you
to do something for me.
- I hate the beard.
- Of course you do.
It just doesn't look good.
I need you to take everything
you know about your business,
set it aside.
Good. Again.
[Will on loudspeaker] Advertising?
Set it aside.
We say to ourselves,
when it takes six months to find a buyer,
"Oh, well, it must have been
a marketing problem,"
but it is not a marketing problem.
The problem
is us.
As a matter of fact,
there's a lot of... [whispers] ...assholes
in this business.
[audience laughing]
And the good news
is that that is good news for you.
[gray-haired woman] I never wanted
to be the one to show places.
Made me too nervous.
So Bill, Will's father,
God rest his soul, uh, insisted.
He says, "Camille, you've got to."
Remember that, honey?
Thank you, dear.
Uh, so anyway, there was
this fellow standing outside...

♪ This can't be true, girl... ♪
[man 1] She loves everything French.
- French dressing, French...
- [woman] Men.
[man 1] French men, French kissing...
- Look who decided to show up.
- [man 1] How's my favorite niece?
Hey.
- Fashionably late.
- No, Wally, we started late.
- [man 1] What happened?
- [man 2] Cut myself.
Kitchen accident.
- Six stitches, right there.
- Bullshit. Judy stabbed him.
[all laughing]
[whispers] You deserved it.
- [man 1] Look at them.
- Young love.
[man 1] Hey, they're calling.
You guys drinking, come on.
- [woman]...traveling for two weeks.
- See anything you like, Vic?
- I can't fucking read this.
- I got you, baby.
I'm gonna have the escargot...
Hey, Wally. I knew Oklahoma
could boot scoot,
but I didn't know
he could speak French. [chuckles]
Judy, here we go. Malta, Croatia.
- Oh yes.
- [woman] We end in Scarborough Castle...
- I'll take the spaghetti, please.
- No, give him the duck.
- [man 3] I'll take the duck.
- Good boy.
- [woman] It's supposed to be haunted.
- [Judy] Are you afraid?
- [woman] No, I'm excited.
- Now, look at Allen's face.
That's the face of a man who's about
to spend more money on one dinner
for four guys he doesn't even like,
than he has on Deena, his kids,
birthdays, Christmas, vacations...
- Did I miss anything else?
- [man 3] No, you got everything.
- [cell phone vibrates]
- [Allen] Excuse me.
Gotta get this. Excuse me.
That's the bank!
[all laughing]
- Tell 'em the Jesse James story.
- Come on, you do it better than I do.
Tell 'em! Tell 'em.
[groans]
[all laughing]
Once upon a time,
Jesse James and his gang robbed a train.
And he held everyone at gunpoint.
He says, "All right,
give us all your money or we kill
the women and rape all the men."
One of the guys with his hands up says,
"I'm sorry, don't you mean
kill the men and rape all the women?"
And then a gay guy in the back says,
"Excuse me, I think Mr. James
knows how to rob a train."
[all laughing]
- [Deena] More wine? Anyone? Anyone?
- [Wally] We need more.
Tell us about this trip.
- [Deena] It's two weeks.
- [tense music playing]
[Deena] We end up at this castle
in Scarborough, England.
It's supposed to be haunted.
We stay there for three nights.
- [Wally] He's not gonna like that.
- [laughter]
[Deena] He doesn't know
it's supposed to be haunted.

Standby 7-2, West 21st Street, #3.
Can you keep a secret?
[indistinct radio chatter]
Sure.
I'm sick.

I got MS.
I just found out last week.
Don't worry, I'm not gonna die on you.

Jesus Christ.
Get those people across the street.
And no press.
I don't want anyone talking to them.
Cleary, what do we got?
We got a dead realtor.
- You already pull the case number?
- [Cleary] Yeah. 19H-012.
[ominous music playing]
[Allen]...and the eaves above the attic.
Lot of nooks and crannies in a place
like this. You've been all over, right?
Is there any back staircase?
That kind of stuff?
Uh-huh? Look in the basement?
What's in the basement?
Uh-huh?
Look in the backyard.
There's sheds and things out there.
I need you to look very carefully
in those kind of places.
[conversation fades out]
[rummaging]
[officers chattering faintly]
So the killer forgot something.
She was stabbed so hard
it got jammed in her pelvis.
Oh.
That's mine.
What's your name, man?
[male officer] Um, Joe.
Joe, when you walk through that door,
there's a jury of 12 watching you.
You understand?
Yes, sir.
[tense music playing]
[woman] I heard a car pull up.
And I looked up and saw a man
walking towards the front door.
Hang on, Brenda. Where were you?
I was in that house right there.
I was outside smoking a cigarette.
Do you live there?
No, I'm the caregiver there.
[male detective]
So you hear the car pull up,
you look this way,
then what happened?
I saw a man walk into the house.
- [man] Just do your job!
- You ever seen that man before?
- [officer] Settle down.
- [Brenda] No.
- About how old do you think he was?
- [Brenda] I don't know.
- What'd he look like?
- [Brenda] I couldn't tell.
He was wearing a hoodie.
I'll tell you what though.
He walked sort of funny.
- What do you mean?
- [Brenda] Like he had a limp.
[music fades]
Hi, Will.
Tom. Scarborough Homicide.
Everything is being recorded.
Before we start, I wanna say that
I'm very sorry about what happened, Will.
How long were you and Summer together?
About a year and a half.
How would you describe your relationship?
Normal.
Uh...
Ups and downs.
Like any relationship, I guess.
[Tom] Hm.
When was the last time you saw her?
Uh, I saw her this morning.
Did you notice anything strange about her?
No.
Well, we... had an argument
last night.
What about?
Doesn't even matter now. I had this thing.
Um, she never showed up.
Do you know
who she was meeting at the house?
[Will hesitates] I don't know.
I don't know their name. She...
She never told me.
[Tom] Huh.
[pen scratching]
I was going to marry her.
I told my mom.
The day I met her.
[inhales sharply] I said...
I said, "I'm going to marry her."
Why didn't you?
Well, she's technically still married.
I know that sounds weird,
but they were separated.
What's her husband's name?
Sam Gifford.
Will, would you be willing to take
a polygraph down the road?
[pen scratching]
Yeah.
Good.
[ominous music playing]
[officer] Open.
Lift your arm.
[shutter clicks]
[Tom] What about the poly?
[Allen] Good luck with that.
Come on, I just want to hook him up to it,
see what he says.
- You don't even have to plug it in.
- You guys did that in Philly?
From time to time, yeah.
Not against the law.
He's got no scratches, nothing under
his nails, no signs of struggle.
Tom, let him go home.
He's cooperating with us.
All we got is a grandmother in Milwaukee
we're trying to get ahold of.
Did we find her phone yet?
[Cleary] No, but we got a ping order.
We've been calling. Nothing.
Okay.

What happened?
They fucked up.
[Tom] I see.
- Hi, Peter.
- [Peter] Hey, Tom.
Uh, our bad. [chuckles]
We made a mistake, but, uh, don't worry.
It's going to come out of our end.
We'll, uh, get it fixed.
[ominous music playing]
[man] You think Nichols
should be our lead?
[Allen] Yeah. Why?
His past may bring
the wrong kind of attention.
He doesn't have a past. He's clean.
If anything, he's got
more experience handling homicide
than anyone in our department.
Okay.
[man exhales]
Good morning.
I'm Chief Marty Graeber.
This is Captain Robert Allen.
We're here to talk about
the murder that occurred last evening.
I do want to remind you all
this is an ongoing investigation,
so there's not going to be
a lot of we can talk about,
but we'll do the best we can.
But I do want to emphasize that
our detectives have been
working through the night.
They will not rest
until we find out who did this.
I want to make that very clear.
[snoring softly]
[Marty] Our men and women are
some of the best in law enforcement
anywhere in the country.
- So with that...
- [whispers] I just wanna air it out.
I love you.
[male voice]
Heard of knives getting stuck before.
First time I've ever seen it.
We had to cut into the bone
and pull it out. That's how hard it hit.
Thirty-three and a half
stab wounds in total.
Semen in her vaginal cavity,
wrists were bound by rope.
Checked with the lab,
there weren't any fingerprints anywhere.
No bruises sustained below the waist.
No sign of forced sexual contact.
Well, we still can't rule out rape, home?
No, that's right.
We can't.
We also recovered blond hair
that doesn't belong to the victim.
Let me see that.
Can I show you something strange?
See this on the edge of her left palm?
It's not blood.
It's paint.
It's called calcimine.
They used it in old houses.
They don't make it anymore.
Found traces of it in the rug.
[Tom] What are these from?
Bruises. Probably a defensive wound.
What happened to your hand?
Kitchen accident.
[keyboard clacking]
- [Allen] Fuck me.
- What is it? Dark blue? Purple?
[Vic] What color
did the neighbor say it was?
The neighbor never saw the car.
This is the only angle we got?
[Tom] Yeah.
It's a Buick LeSabre.
[Vic] Yep. Buick LeSabre, 1990.
Excuse me, sir. Zoom in.
Is it missing a hubcap?
[keyboard clacking]
[Tom] Right there, huh?
[Allen] It's a good catch.
[ominous music playing]
[riffling sound]
Who is that?
Summer and her ex-husband.
Uh-huh.
Can I borrow this?
Sure, take whatever you want.
I can't stay here.
[Tom] I understand.
You mind?
No.
[drawer clicks]
[fabric rustling]
[music fades]
[rattling]
She had only one computer?
Uh, yeah, just the laptop.
She always took it with her.
[ominous music playing]
Mr. Grady.
Do you know if Summer had life insurance?
No, I don't know.
Okay.
It's easy to find out.
[pills rattling]
Thank you.
[whispers] I love this kitchen.

[muttering]
Yeah. I don't know him.
[Tom] Okay.
Do you know
if she had any secret admirers?
No.
[tense string music builds]
[music fades]
[approaching footsteps]
[Cleary] She's got no life insurance.
Check this out.
- [Tom] What am I watching?
- Sam Gifford. The ex-husband.
He's on file for a bunch of dope stuff.
Apparently he collects
human hair for his art.
He ain't afraid.
[chuckles]
A beauty school dropout, huh?
[intense, dramatic music playing]
[birdsong]
[man] Excuse me.
[Cleary] Oh.
Hey. Sorry.
[Tom] Afternoon.
We're with the Scarborough
Police Department.
And we're looking for Sam Gifford.
[man] Okay. That's me.
[Tom] We'd like to talk to you
about Summer Elswick.
Do you mind if we talk up front?
[ominous music playing]
Is she okay?
Well, uh... not really.
[Sam] What happened?
She was attacked by someone
and she was stabbed.
Is she dead?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Sam.
I'd like to ask you some questions.
Okay?
Yeah.
When was the last time you saw her?
[Sam murmurs]
Couple of months ago.
Where were you Saturday?
Uh, I was, uh... [clears throat]
...fishing.
- Fishing up north near Jackson Lake.
- And who'd you go with?
I went alone.
- Like what time?
- [Sam] Maybe, um...
nine a.m.?
[Cleary] What time d'you get back?
I got home last night.
- Is that your truck?
- [Sam] Yeah, it is.
[Tom] Did you drive up in it?
- I did.
- [Tom] Okay.
What's that on your hand?
[inhales sharply]
- It's paint.
- [Cleary] Oh yeah?
Can I... Mind if I see it?
Am I a suspect?
Well, Mr. Gifford, right now everyone
is a suspect. You understand.
- We're just trying to do our job.
- Yeah, I understand.
Um, if you guys aren't going to
read me my rights, we're done here.
And if you are,
I want a lawyer. Thank you.
[Tom] Wait!
- We're just trying to gather information.
- [Sam] Have a nice day.
[Tom] William, Oklahoma, Mary, 755.
I need all the LPR northbound
and southbound on I-35.
Yeah. You got it buddy. Thank you.
By the way,
why does Wally call you Oklahoma?
[engine turns over]
'Cause I can cut a rug, baby.

[square dance caller]
Sides face, grand square.
50% of female victims

[Judy squeals]
[square dance caller] Four ladies chain.
Promenade.
Multiple stab wounds?
I mean, that's a crime of passion.
And if the husband's a drug user,
you can bump that up to 90%.
- Baby, I'm concentrating.
- [snickers, laughs]
[square dance caller] Allemande left,
and a right-and-left grand.
Keep the corner.
[country music playing]
There you go. There you go.
- [Deena] Wally, what are you giving us?
- He's promoting himself.
- Here you go.
- [Allen] His side business.
It even has a logo.
Now, please tell your uncle,
it's called capitalism.
And he could learn a thing or two.
[Vic's wife] What is this,
"Active Duty Security Consulting"?
What's up with the bulldog?
Because when we bite, we never let go.
- [all oohing]
- [chuckles]
Come on, Wally, be honest.
This ain't your logo.
This is definitely your mugshot.
[all laughing]
Did you hear that?
At least they got my good side.
[Allen] Do you have to be
walked twice a day?
- [all laughing]
- [music fades]
How long have you been with your lady?
Too long. Six years.
Why don't you marry her?
[Cleary] No fucking way.
[chuckles]
How old are you, man?
Forty-five.
Coming up to that big five-oh.
You don't want to end up old and alone.
That's a real bitch.
I came into this world alone,
I'll go through it alone,
and I'm going to die alone.
So fuck it.
Okay, tough guy.
She sold half a dozen houses,
no commissions.
That'd piss me off.
[tense music playing]
[Tom] According to her records,
she didn't get commissions
on six of her sales.
Is that right?
Well, it's... it's a little more
complicated than that.
Her commissions went into
the purchase of an investment property.
That way she didn't have to pay taxes.
It's a townhouse on McKinley.
About how much money we talking about?
Uh, I think about 70 grand.
We don't touch it.
It goes to the family.
Who owns 1502 Whitcomb, by the way?
I own it.
That's good to know.
One less phone call we have to make.
[Cleary] Seventy grand.
She never got a divorce.
That's a motive for the ex.
[Tom] Maybe.
- [Deena] Let's see it.
- [Judy] Eighteen grand.
Oh, that's a lot of money.
[Judy sighs] It's an investment
if we ever want to sell it, but...
That's awful. Who would do that?
In Philly, when Tommy's partner
was being investigated,
we were dealing with
all kinds of crazy shit.
Tommy was sleeping
with a gun under his pillow.
I was convinced
he was gonna blow my tits off.
- Where's my money?
- Jesus Christ! What the fuck?
[Judy] The cops under investigation
thought Tommy was gonna talk.
They used to carve,
like with a rock or something,
they used to carve this shit
into the windshield of my car,
like, "Cheese-eater.
Admit the rat in you."
That must have been hell.
[Judy] Ugh, you have no idea.
That's why we had to leave.
- [Wally] It's Paul's birthday. Sign it.
- Jesus. You're fucking crazy.
He's gonna love it.
Not the right tit. That's for Allen.
Tommy was so depressed
he wouldn't come out of the bedroom.
It knocked the life out of us.
Never again.
If it wasn't for my uncle and Deena,
who knows where we'd be.
So how's Mr. Detective Cleary doing?
Well, aside from never wearing a tie...
he's doing pretty good.
Good. Because I taught him
everything he knows.
Not everything I know.
Everything he knows.
[laughs]
Oh, man, those eggs are good...
[Judy] Uncle Allen had a scare.
What do you mean?
He was in the hot tub
and he couldn't get out. He couldn't move.
Deena had to pull him out all by herself.
How is he now?
He's fine.
[TV continues in background]
- Deena should've called us.
- I know.
[sighs] She's worried that
it's only going to get worse now.
[doorbell chimes]
[doorbell chimes]
[doorbell chimes]
[Will] Jesus Christ.
Yes?
[man] Yes, sorry to bother you.
I think I accidentally got
some of your mail.
Thank you.
Oh wait, that's... This is mine.
I don't... This one was open already.
This is mine, that's yours.
That's yours. That's yours.
All the rest are yours.
Okay. All right, thank you.
You don't remember me?
No, I'm sorry.
[man] Well, I guess, uh...
I wouldn't remember me either.
You know, if I were you.
Is your mother home?
Your mother would remember me.
[ominous music playing]
I just wanted to give you
my condolences. That's it.
- Move your fucking foot!
- No problem.
[lock clicks]
[footsteps on staircase]
What the fuck?
[Cleary] Her phone pinged in Limerick
at 19:40 the night before she was killed.
- [Tom] Where the fuck is Limerick?
- About 45 minutes east.
She sold a property there.
Why would she go back?
[Cleary] To show it.
No.
She sold it 14 months ago.
[tense music playing]
[hinge creaking]
[floorboard creaks]
[Tom picks up item]
[tense music swells]
[door hinge creaking]
Can I help you?
And, uh, who's been painting it?
Church members volunteer.
I'm the caretaker. I just watch the place.
Okay.
So...
have you seen her before?
I... I don't recognize her.
- No?
- Mm-mm.
[clicks laptop keyboard]
How about that car?
No, I haven't seen it.
Okay, well, one more.
How about this gentleman?
[murmurs] No, I haven't seen him.
- Okay, well... oh for three.
- [chuckles]
[Tom] At least we know
where the paint came from.
[Cleary] Yeah.
And the hair came back. It's a wig.
[Tom] What about the number
that called her?
[Cleary] It's a burner.
It only dialed one number. Summer's.
It was activated
the day before the murder.
The day she received the initial call.
It was used to make six calls to Summer.
After the murder, nothing.
[liquid sloshing]
Get me the video from the store.
Yeah, we tried.
They wiped it.
Oh great. So we got a wig and shit.
[Judy] I'd call that grape purple.
Okay. We got a purple Buick.
It's not a Buick.
This is the car I drove in college.
It's a Chrysler Imperial from the '90s.
You see that slit right there?
That's a window.
My dad got me one.
Everyone thought I was a narc.
Here, let me show you.
Is that the car
you lost your virginity in?
- No. It was a different car.
- [Tom] Hm.
- And it was in high school.
- Oh, that's right.
You were 14. That's gross.
You're gross.
You lost your virginity to a prostitute.
Look, you see the eyelids
right there on the headlights?
They open and close.
- ["Oogum Boogum Song" ringtone sounds]
- Oh. Unknown caller.
Who could that be? Your hooker?
Hello?
[ignition clicks]
You got this August 26th?
Uh, let me check the invoice.
No. Received May 26th.
Is this the original paint?
[dealer] Uh, yes, it is. Factory paint.
Okay, thank you.
- [dealer] Anything you need, let me know.
- [Cleary] Yeah.
- What year is this Silverado?
- [dealer] 2020.
- How many miles?
- [dealer] Thirty thousand.
Cleary. Come check it out.
[Cleary strains]
[car seat whirring]
[chuckling]
It's nice, huh?
Yeah.
Fifty K.
You can afford that?
Hell yeah.
Really?
You're forgetting one thing.
What's that?
The overtime, baby.
Milk it.
[laughs]
- Does it have rear video?
- [dealer] Yes, sir. Rear and front.
[woman] She was precious.
[Will] She was.
Thank you.
And I'm so glad that I could be here.
Me too.
Thank you, son.
[tense music playing]
[music intensifies]
[Will] Hey.
Hey, stop!
[music fades]
[thunder clapping]
[man on video] The Chrysler Imperial and
the New Yorker Fifth Avenue that shares...
...are the biggest Chryslers you can buy.
[video stops]
[Tom] My condolences, Will.
Thank you.
Um, can I talk to you for a second?
Of course.
[sighs]
A few nights ago,
this guy we know
showed up at my mother's house.
He was acting strange and...
Strange in what way?
He tried to force himself
inside the house.
- How?
- I went to close the door.
- [Tom] Uh-huh?
- He puts his foot in the door.
Okay.
What's his name?
[Will sighs]
Eli Phillips.
How do you know him?
We bought a piece of land to develop.
This is when my dad ran the company.
It was a farm. A family farm.
We gave them a fair price.
They still didn't want to sell.
I guess they really didn't have a choice.
Anyway, after we bought it,
the father committed suicide.
And the son blamed it on us.
He's tried to hack into
our server a few times.
Our IT guy keeps blocking him.
I understand.
But, uh, there's not much we can do.
Unless he shows up again.
And if he does,
you call me.
Anytime.
Thanks.
[car door shuts]
I've been abused,
harassed, tortured, bullied...
[Cleary] He was at Whitcomb.
[Eli] The police aren't gonna do anything...
These are the people Summer called
in the last three months.
[Tom] Good.
The FBI has a record that she called them
and wanted to report narcotics activity.
Apparently, they gave her
the number for the DEA.
They say she never called.
[Tom] Uh-huh.
Hey, Smith. Not bad for a rookie.
[Smith] Thanks, boss.
[ominous music playing]
[knocking]
[Eli] Fuck off!
[door rattling]
You know...
[Tom] Eli Phillips?
I'm Detective Tom Nichols.
This is my partner Dan Cleary.
Got a minute to chat?
About what?
Summer Elswick.
Summer... [murmurs]
Yeah, sure. No problem.
Just give me one second.
Let me put some clothes on.
[door rattling]
Hey, how you doing?
You have any weapons on you?
[Eli] No.
Okay. You mind turning around?
Just turn around.
Just put your arms out. Yep.
There you go.
Anything, uh, sharp in your pockets
that might surprise me?
[Eli] No.
Hey, you know what? We have
the same birthday, me and you.
- No shit.
- [Eli] Yep.
Geminis, right?
Gemini?
May 26?
Yeah.
We're like, uh, twins. [chuckles]
Saw you outside of Whitcomb
the other night.
Yeah. 'Cause I was there.
Yeah? What were you doing there?
I heard about it.
[Cleary] Yeah? So how'd you hear about it?
Uh, police scanner.
It's a little hobby of mine.
[chuckling]
I can tell you who did it,
if you guys want me to.
Okay, who's that?
Will Grady.
Funny, he just told us you showed up at
his mother's and threatened both of them.
He said... that I... Well, that's a lie.
I didn't threaten anybody.
- Yeah, they're both lying, both liars.
- [Tom] Anyway.
If you go back, it's gonna be
considered intimidation of a witness,
and you're gonna be arrested.
- I didn't threaten...
- No. Listen to me.
You're gonna be arrested. You understand?
You know, I know who you are.
I read an article about you, uh,
and your partner.
Corzano?
Convicted for drugs,
gambling, uh, bribery.
You didn't know that?
You known him six years?
You didn't know anything about it?
That sounds like a lie to me.
Why were you really
at Whitcomb the night she was killed?
Because I wanted to see Will Grady
in, uh...
in handcuffs.
- [Eli sniffles]
- [Tom] Why?
Because he's the devil. That's why.
He's a crook.
They're all crooks.
Like your partner. [sniffles]
Did you have anything
to do with Summer's death?
No.
Good. You mind
if we take a sample of your DNA?
[Eli] No.
- Cool. Let's do it now.
- [Eli] You mean here? Now?
[Tom and Cleary] Yeah.
I meant, no, I don't... I don't...
Uh, wouldn't like that right now.
- I don't like needles.
- It's not needles. It's a Q-tip.
- [Eli] Oh, they're doing Q-tips now.
- It's just a swab.
- Should I talk to a lawyer?
- No, you don't need to talk to a lawyer.
Call me when you make up your mind. Okay?
Stay away from the Gradys.
And take it easy with that hat.
You don't want to get hurt.
[Eli] I respect the police.
[tense music playing]
[Marty] What do we know about the husband?
We got his license plate up at
Jackson Lake at the time of the murder.
You got his car there.
You don't have him.
She called the FBI to report narcotics.
Do we have a record of her calling us?
- [approaching footsteps]
- No, sir. We checked.
Who do we like for the DNA?
- [Marty] Oh, come on...
- Jesus.
[all chuckling]
I got the boyfriend for 20.
Come on, Nichols. Who do you got?
- Look at Allen. A steady rolling man.
- [all chuckle]
All right, I'll go with
Will Grady, the boyfriend.
Ah, okay. Safe bet.
What about you, Vic? Who do you got?
Let me ask you guys a question.
When you interviewed the Eli guy,
did he have a blond wig on by any chance?
[all laughing]
Nah, I'll take Eli.
- [Allen] Okay.
- Nichols' twin.
I'm going with the fisherman.
The ex-husband.
- Here you go.
- All right.
Sir?
Uh, I'll pass.
Remind me again why we never
put out an APB on the Chrysler?
- Well, we just got a verification.
- Okay, then let's do it.
- Okay.
- [Allen] Hold up.
There are 8,000 Chryslers in the county.
We're going to start a wild goose chase,
get everybody scared.
We're going to be getting
the DNA any moment.
We don't get the gift,
then we go after the Chrysler.
Okay. Okay. All right.
Okay, here we go. [clears throat]
- Thank you.
- [Marty] Thank you so much.
- Make some space.
- Move that.
Deena's just getting drinks.
[Marty] Okay. Here we go.
[Allen] One beer
is not gonna kill the old man.
- [Marty] Who wants pepperoni and sausage?
- Gimme one of those.
Let me ask you something.
Does that look like a bite mark to you?
- [Allen] That's good.
- [Cleary] All right. That looks good.
- [Marty] Who wants cheese? Anybody?
- [Allen] Thank you.
- [Marty] Anybody? Anybody?
- [Cleary] I got one. Thank you.
Hey, we're still doing that walk-through
with the boyfriend, right?
Yeah. When do you want to do it?
The sooner, the better.
[country music playing on PA]
[door opens]
Can you turn the recorder off, please?
[ominous music playing]
Have you talked to Sam Gifford yet?
[Tom] Yes, we have.
Did he tell you
they were still seeing each other?
[Tom] No.
Well, they were.
[Tom] How do you know that?
I was there.
You were where?
They used to fool around
in some of the houses.
[Cleary] Wait.
Last time we talked,
you said you didn't know the ex-husband,
and now you do.
Why are you telling us now?
My ex didn't want me talking to you guys.
Why is that?
Him and Sam work together.
[Cleary] What kind of work does he do?
He sells heroin and coke.
Was Summer involved with drugs?
No.
[car alarm chirps]
- You think I can change my bet?
- [snickers]
- I'm not wearing a tie.
- You have to.
Everybody will be wearing one.

- And stopped right where you are.
- [cell phone clicks]
Uh, I noticed her shoes right here.
Is that unusual?
[Will] Not really.
You want to protect the floor.
[Tom] Hm.
Um, so, I, uh...
I called out for her.
Um, no answer.
I try her phone, nothing.
And then what?
[intense, dramatic stinger]
[breathing shakily]
I, uh...
I kneeled down
to, uh...
to try to give her, uh, CPR.
[Will clears throat]
[coughs] I'm sorry.

- I think you know.
- You'll have to come with us.
- [Cleary] Relax. Come on.
Let's go get your clothes.
All right? Come on.
- [Sam] What? Why?
- We got a hit on your DNA.
- Yeah, we were sleeping together.
- Okay, good.
You can tell us all about it

Don't mention nothing about the limp.
Nothing about the Chrysler.
Nothing about the fact

They're washing their hands.
You don't have to wash yours.
But I don't want you being upset
over a guy who tried to kill you.

[Marty] Yeah, I'll make sure of it.
Yeah, it'll be good. All right.
See you.
You pissed clean.
Now we just got to get you

Oh, thanks.

That's what happened.
I still feel bad though.
I lied.

sleeping with her ex.
We all get fleeced.
I was married.
And my husband told his mistress
I was his roommate.

[woman] You were raised by your mom?

[Tom] Oh, no. I was raised by my father.

[woman] And your mother?
I don't know my mother.
[woman] I'm sorry to hear that.
[Tom] That's all right.
So, as you know, this session is just
a requirement so you can get back to work.
[Tom] Sounds good.
[woman] How have you been feeling?
[Tom] Fine.
[woman] How are you sleeping?
[Tom] Pretty good now.
{\an8}But you know,
for years I've had this dream.
{\an8}It's a recurring dream where I'm in
someone's house and there's people there.
{\an8}It's like a party or something.
{\an8}And then these bad guys come in,
and they start shooting at everyone.
{\an8}And every time I get my gun out...
{\an8}I can't pull the trigger.
{\an8}It's a real nightmare.
[woman] That's a very common dream
among law enforcement.
[Tom] Really?
Well, you know what's happened?
{\an8}Since the shooting,
{\an8}I've had that same dream,

I know when she's bluffing.

- No, deal me out. Deal me out.
You gotta take care of yourself.
Take care of your family.
Look at Allen.
He's sick. I'm not supposed
to say nothin', but look at him.
Shit happens.
You gotta think about your future.

All you gotta do is stand outside

It's nothing.
Just something for you to think about.
That's a nice watch, Wally.
Keep it.
I dunno.
[Wally] I want you to have it.
I don't give a fuck.
It's a Rolex. It's just a watch.
It's your watch, Wally. I don't want it.
Thank you.

Wally, if he doesn't want it,
I'll take it.

I'll make sure one of 'em

It's a big house. Nobody's gonna find out.
Look, I had a long talk with Graeber,
and we're going to recommend you
for the Medal of Valor.
I don't want a medal for killing someone.
You're not getting it for killing Gifford.
You're getting it
for saving Cleary's life.
[sighs]
Been doing some soul-searching.
Took your advice.
Oh yeah?
Yeah.
What's that?
No more Mr. Tough Guy.
Getting married.
Congratulations.
- That's awesome.
- Thanks.
Yeah, we haven't set a date yet, but, uh...
be honored if you'd be my best man.
Best man, huh?
That's a lot of work, Dan.

- Okay, okay, uh... How about an usher?

An usher. Yeah.
We can do that.

[Tom] That's a bite.
It was the dentals that got Ted Bundy.
[man] I'm pretty sure you're right.
This looks like a human bite to me.
So what do you want me to do?
You tell me. You're the expert.
Get me the dentals of this Gifford guy
and maybe we can rule him out.
Who confirmed that this is a human bite?
A forensic odontologist friend of mine
I used in Philly.
Uh-huh?
How do we know those weren't
there from a few days before?
Well, unless her hands were tied
in that position two days before,
that was done at Whitcomb.
So?
What do you want to do?
I want to get
Sam Gifford's dental impressions.
See if they match.
You really want to do that?
I feel it's the right thing to do.

gonna stay home for the night.
- Is Allen okay?
- Yeah.
Is that Peter over there? Our contractor?
Oh yeah.
[Judy chuckles]
What's he doing here?
- I might have told him about it.
- Okay.
That was a lot more fun than I remembered.
Haven't done that since I was a kid.
- [Judy] Hey.
- Hey. How are you?
I saw the owner of Zuzu's.
Should I tell her about my bags?
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Go on. Yeah.
How's that, uh...
that new kitchen treating you?
You find her attractive?
Which one? [chuckles]
How far would you go?
Excuse me?
No, are you willing to die for it?
[tense music playing]
I... I don't know what
we're talking about here, Tom.
You don't know what the fuck
I'm talking about?
- [Peter] No. Absolutely no idea.
- Holy shit. You're fucking cute.
I'm warning you, man.
Don't let me fucking catch you.
How'd it go?
Done. Should we hit the floor?
Uh, I'm okay.
Peter, want to go?
No, I'm going to sit this one out.
No?
Okay.
You and me, babe. How 'bout it?
[Judy] No. He was more scared than I was.
[Allen] Did he say why he was there?
He said he knew Tom.
And he tried to leave,
so I fired a warning shot.
[cell phone chimes]
[Jimmy] Hey, Tom.
Got the phone records you wanted.
You know, uh, the only weird thing I see
is that this Rudi Rakoczy guy
called this 3586 number 17 times
the day Summer Elswick was killed.
Anyway, food for thought.
Just found that interesting.
[Tom, under breath] 809-122-3586.

Charming.

[Will] You give me back
what you took from the office,
and I won't press charges.
Wait a minute. Let me get this straight.
I give you what I took from your office,

- [Will] Very good.

How's your mom doing?
She still kicking?
No, she's... she's dead, Will.

Hello?
Hello?
[Jimmy] Here's what I got.
That 3586 phone number I flagged for you.
It belongs to a property trust.
No shit.
What else you got?
All I see is that it's listed under W6.
I talked to Deena, and they can
get the stem cell in the Bahamas,
but it's expensive
and their insurance won't cover it.
Well, they can afford it.
Right?
Yeah.
[light piano music playing]
Is everything okay?
Yeah, everything's okay.
- I think we're finished here.
- Babe, you didn't even eat.
I'm not hungry. We'll take this to go.
[waiter] Would you like any dessert?
Um...
- No.
- We'll just have the check, please.
Thank you.
Oh my God. Look who's here.
Who?
[Judy] Will Grady.
[tense music playing]
[Judy] Is that his girlfriend?
[tense music fades]
[Judy] That was fast.
Guess people grieve differently.
[glasses clinking]
So they're covering all the closing costs.
They were eager.
You should've heard this guy
with the other broker.
He was an animal.
Didn't know you had it in you.
Well, I learned from the best.
- You got your card?
- [Judy] Yeah.
- Okay, I'm gonna go say hello.
- [Judy] Okay.
[ominous music playing]
Thank you.
[ominous music fades]
[light piano music resumes]
[inaudible]
- [Judy] Everything okay?
- Everything is fine.
[ominous music playing]
Hey.
You're early.
- You found it good?
- [Tom] Yeah, yeah.
Oh. It's the first time I've ever
shown a house at gunpoint.
- You're not afraid of guns, are you?
- Not if they're in the right hands.
Oh good.
[Will] Come on in.
So this was a formal living room,
but I think it'd make a great study
or an office.
And in here,
you've got more of your family room.
Could put a TV up there,
and there's great outdoor space as well.
Through here, got your kitchen.
Now, I think it looks a little dated,
but, uh, you know, you can replace
these countertops with, uh,
granite or some type of marble.
If your wife loves to cook,
I mean, I think she'll love this.
This is my favorite room in the house.
I mean, you could have a kids' playroom
or, you know, a man cave.
[music fades]
Wanna see the upstairs?
Let's start this way.
Right through to the master.
This is a relic
from the previous owner. [chuckles]
[cell phone keyboard clicking]
[Will] It's a street-facing view.
You know, it's a good room,
but I'd rip out the carpets
and start fresh.
[cell phone vibrating]
You gonna answer that?
- [gunshot]
- [Tom groans]

Fuck.

[Tom] Nothing. Go back to sleep.
[Judy] Are you ready, babe?
I'm ready.
[rock music playing]
- [Judy] Happy birthday.
- There they are!
There she is. Hey, beautiful. [kissing]
- Hey, Tommy.
- [Tom] Happy birthday.
Listen, I need to talk to you
about something, just you and me.
- Perfect. Me too.
- Okay?
- All right.
- [Tom] Okay.
[Deena] Mahalo!
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
- One for you.

[Wally] Tom.
Why are you avoiding me?
I'm not avoiding you.
I've been here the whole fucking time.
You haven't even said hello.
Hello, Wally.
Come on. Give me a hug.
- I'll see you later, all right?
- Okay.
[Allen] How you feeling?
[Tom] Good.
What'd you want to talk to me about?
Uh...
[tense music playing]
You go first.
[Allen] Well,
it's happening.
What's happening?
It's been confirmed.
You're getting the medal.
[Wally] Hey, you're up here?
[Allen] Come on up.
We just got some great news.
Perfect timing.
[Wally] What's up?
[Allen] Well, it's just been confirmed.
Tommy's getting the Medal of Valor.
Congratulations.
[Wally] Good for you.
[Allen] It's the second-highest honor.
Only one higher is the Medal of Honor.
That one you got to die for.
I mean, come on, shall we have a drink?
This deserves a drink.

Just like the one at Whitcomb.
Yeah, I'm storing it for someone.
[Tom] For who?
Tommy... [chuckles]

You and Judy have a good thing here.
Let it go.

How much further do you have

Three minutes.
[policeman] I'll need to follow you home.
Thank you.
By the way, congratulations on your medal.
Much deserved, sir.
[ominous music swells]
Are you gonna tell me
what the fuck is going on?
Why don't you ask your uncle
what the fuck is going on?
What are you talking about?
[Tom] White Fish is Wally and Will Grady.
Wally plants the dope,
and the houses get seized.
Then White Fish buys them.
Summer was the broker.
On paper, she made 70 grand,
but she didn't see a penny.
She didn't know anything about it.
[Judy] So they killed
that girl over money?
[Tom] No.
She was gonna talk.
You gotta tell Allen.
What are you telling me right now?
He's in on it.
What?
He's either one of them
or he's helping them.
What do you mean?
The Chrysler we've been looking for?
It's sitting in his garage right now,
as we speak.
The Chrysler.
[Tom] Yeah.
[car passes by]
[car drives off]
I know.
It's crazy.
There's only one thing I love
almost as much as I love you.
And that's being a cop.
["Oogum Boogum Song" ringtone sounds]

This thing does not love me.

- [Tom] It's him.
- [cell phone vibrating]

Yeah.
I'm gonna need you to pack a bag.
We're not sleeping here tonight.
- Hello.
- [Allen] Hi, Tom.
You got a second?
[Tom] Yeah.
Listen, I want us to talk about the thing.
There's an explanation.
It... It's not what you think.
[Tom] Okay.
What do you say to coming over to
the house tomorrow morning so we can talk?
[Tom] What time?
[Allen] Nine a.m.?
- Sounds good.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
It's gonna be fine.
He's kept his mouth shut before.
He'll do it again.
[tense music playing]
[Marty] And you think Summer knew
that our department
was involved in all this shit?
Yes, sir. I do.
I think that's why she called the FBI
and not us.
When you asked Allen about the car,
what did he say?
He said he was keeping it for someone.
Did he say who?
[exhales sharply]
Tom, I've known him for 40 years.
This is crazy.
You tell anyone about this?
No, sir.
