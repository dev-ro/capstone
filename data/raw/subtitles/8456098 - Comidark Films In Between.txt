Brother Aytac, we're officially out
of Istanbul. This is really happening.
I don't know.
You know, Brother Nevzat brought
fishing rods and everything.
Just say you're leaving and leave.
Why is he so afraid?
They're under the thumb. Can't even take
a dump without their wives' permission.
Is this what marriage is? That's it?
Don't talk to me about marriage.
I have gamophobia.
Take a look.
Is there something wrong with it?
-Seems fine.
-No, Ibo.
It's quite all right.
Why are we doing it this week? Damn.
I can't even get into the pool
or drink booze in this condition.
How am I going to enjoy it there now?
I thought it was going to be next week.
I'm sure getting
into the pool won't be a problem.
Dude, have you ever had a hair implant?
You don't know shit.
What are you saying? Alcohol and sex
are prohibited in the first three days.
Why would you get a hair implant
if sex is out of the picture?
People don't get a hair transplant
for sexual purposes, dipshit.
The prick won't take a dump.
I took him to a private restroom,
and he still refused. Take him.
Give it here, brother.
Sandwiches with roast meat and cheese.
Anyone?
Roast meat? Come on, man.
We're trying to detox.
Come on, brother.
Detox with four guys? Yeah, right.
They're on a getaway.
THE GETAWAY
Brother Nevzat, did they say
the spa was included?
Dude, do you know what spa means?
You know, the hot pool and the thing...
-What thing?
-A massage, for example.
Massage is included of course.
And a healthy diet with vitamin C.
They even have ozone therapy.
Purifies the blood.
-That's the first day. Then what?
-Then sex all day every day!
Good God. Pull over. I'm leaving.
Ibo, just take it easy.
-Do you know what the kid said?
-What?
That all those popular businessmen
go here and purify themselves.
Which businessman?
Why would they disclose their names,
you dumb fuck?
Privacy is important.
Privacy means
there's all sorts of action there.
-Why did you bring the dog?
-What else could I do?
You know the situation.
How could I refuse to take it with me?
-Yes, my love.
-Ibo, where are you?
About to reach Bursa.
-I'll call you when we get there.
-All right, do that.
-Okay, sweetheart. Love you!
-All right.
What was your excuse?
I said we were going fishing.
Business meeting.
-Stop breathing on my back, you prick.
-Come here.
Brother Nevzat, what does Lucky mean?
It means fucking peace.
A peace-fucker?
No, come on. Lucky means...
Isn't it in English?
-Sure, it is.
-It means fortunate.
-As in luck.
-Fortunate.
My fortunate boy.
Fortunate.
It'll be okay, brother. I'm telling you,
our whole world is going to change.
Did Brother Rahmi get his aroma therapy?
Yes. Mr. Ethem will be checking out today.
Nice.
Let's go.
My Alpay.
Brother Suheyl,
throwing balls is prohibited.
All right, darling.
Hey, is that the way to use the fridge?
It's all right, Mr. Alpay.
It has a 25-year guarantee.
Really? Even I don't have that much.
Nice grass.
-Who's he?
-Mehmet. Delivering unprocessed eggs.
Right! Mehmet, this is not how it works.
This is wrong. What the hell?
They shine like diamonds.
Put some shit on them.
What can I do?
It's how the chickens do it.
Wrong. I sell them as organic eggs.
I sell them for 40 liras.
They shouldn't shine. Smear some shit on.
-What should I do? Shit on them?
-If that's what it takes!
Good Lord!
I'll take a shit when I need a shit!
What the hell?
-Yes, we'll do that.
-Okay, we'll take them away.
Dear Brother Ethem.
I'll say just one word... paradise.
Come on, now.
Please don't forget about us.
You always have a place to stay here.
Istanbul is boring anyway,
same guys everywhere.
Right? Get your red blood cells tested
back in Istanbul.
-You'll see the difference.
-I will.
Did they give you the olive oil?
They did.
Alpay, this will be my second home
in Komluk.
-Safe travels.
-Thank you.
Come on.
Even the way he walks has changed.
Come on.
Come here.
My Alpay.
-My Brother Nevzat, welcome.
-Thank you.
Here we are. You know we assembled
all the air-conditioners here?
-Come on, now.
-Mr. Ibrahim.
-Welcome.
-Thank you.
Sensual Spa, founded in 1999.
I assure you we don't call our guests
"guests" here.
-What do you call them?
-Snowflakes.
Bring the cold towels at once.
The little boy is here too.
-Yeah.
-Whose?
-Mine.
-It doesn't look like you.
-Told you.
-Well, I couldn't leave him behind.
That's okay. Welcome, come on.
-Okay.
-Let's go.
This is the place to go
to escape the city.
I mean, I don't think body and soul
are two different vessels.
We offer a whole new world
and encourage both to reign
in the same vessel. Let me see some IDs.
Give it here, Melis.
Let me hand you the brochures. Sensual.
Here. Come here, honey.
Whoa! Mr. Alpay. Is this tequila?
Cinnabar. Rich in antioxidants.
Dear brother. I got a hair implant.
Would this be harmful?
You did? Where is it?
Here.
I wouldn't notice if you hadn't said.
I thought it was original.
-So, shall we find our rooms?
-We have some procedures first.
We'll check your blood, vitamin C and all.
Darling!
Brother Nevzat.
Like this! Beautiful.
Bring some vitamin C right now.
After you.
Go on.
Vitamin C, yes.
Bring it here.
I brought cash for the payment.
How would you like to do it, brother?
Don't mention it. That's not urgent.
Let's get you some vitamin C first.
Honey, some for Mr. Nevzat, too.
Okay, then.
We have to send this group away
by tomorrow midday
-because we have other guests arriving.
-Okay.
Where are these girls, Brother Nevzat?
Are they dead? Where are they?
Sit tight. We just got here, man.
Be patient.
-Are you going to drink that?
-No, get me some ayran.
It feels really good.
Mr. Alpay, we drank these.
Brother Aytac, what did you want?
Get me some ayran with salt please.
That'd be too rich in sodium.
We can't serve you ayran.
They can't.
Serve them little portions of everything.
And tell them the solarium is closed.
-Okay.
-Out of order.
What do you think about the welcome?
It's awesome from the start.
-It's great, right?
-Right from the beginning.
It's paradise.
Leave it already!
Follow me, please.
So, what now? Are we going
to get suited up and meet back here?
There are robes in the rooms,
wear them and meet me here.
Brother Nevzat.
-Won't you ask?
-Just be patient.
What is it, brother?
Mr. Alpay, I was wondering if we could...
With the ladies...
What do you mean?
I mean, is it possible to get together
with the ladies tonight?
Fuck, Neco. What a degenerate man you are.
How could you say that to him?
How could you treat him like a pimp?
They will be here around 11:00 p.m.
Head to your room and do what you need
to do. Therapy will start soon.
You'll be soft like silk.
Awaken the kundalini.
Like this. Root chakra is very important.
Right on the head. Yes.
Don't make it too limp.
Just the right tone of pink.
Yes, awakening it.
I thought we were going
to get some action tonight.
Yes, but wait and see, I guess.
What do you think, Ibrahim?
We are refreshed, my Nevzat.
We should come here more often,
but things are busy, you know.
Each getaway costs me dearly.
I have to renew the kitchen cabinets
as soon as I get back home.
Farewell to another 15 grand.
Just wait, brother. You'll forget
about everything tonight.
What? What's going on tonight?
Stop it!
Hello. I'm fine, sweetheart. You?
Well, the weather is good for now,
but it gets cloudy sometimes.
We're just getting started.
I swear to God,
it breaks my heart to see him like that.
-Lucky is here. Running around.
-Poor guy.
Mr. Ibrahim.
I have two different wigs here.
See, this one and this one.
What fucking wig? Why would I need that?
It's not a fucking wig.
You can use it daily. Just asking...
Guys, Lucky is missing.
-What do you mean?
-He must be somewhere here.
Lucky!
-Lucky!
-My boy!
Don't worry, Brother Nevzat.
He's probably somewhere here.
-Where is he, then? Where?
-Lucky!
Come on.
He shits all over the place.
Sir, the good boy is here.
So, we have to charge extra
for tonight's detox.
They will be here around eleven.
-Tonight's detox?
-They asked for girls to fuck.
What the hell, guys? Are you insane?
Come on, Brother Ibrahim. It's okay.
You brought me here talking
about spa and shit but here we are...
-Let's not darken the mood.
-All right, Ibo. Just go to the solarium.
Solarium is out of order, though.
-You shouldn't have got that implant.
-Cut the crap!
Why not schedule this for next week?
So, you'd join us with the girls
if you had the chance, huh?
Leave me out of it. I'll go to sleep.
I already lied to my wife.
Why did you trick me?
Talking about spa, detox and shit.
That's why you made up the lie
about fishing, right?
You could have mentioned spa.
Why didn't you?
And you said it was a business meeting.
Why did you lie?
If you'd mentioned spa, your wife
would have been suspicious.
For God's sake. Aytac, are you with us?
-Of course, I'm with you.
-You don't have a phobia or anything?
I don't think there is a phobia for that.
If there is one then he must face it.
Look, we're here to relieve some stress
just for two days.
Nobody has to know about it.
It's a private get-together.
It's done and gone. Drink up!
Drink up? Get the fuck out of here!
You should've scheduled it for next week!
-Why is he so angry?
-It's about the hair, man.
Whatever, guys. Enjoy your detox.
Mr. Kaya, here is your kephir.
Forget about the kephir.
Fix me a gin and tonic.
-But it's intoxicating.
-Fuck the toxins, fix me some gin!
-Yes, sweetheart.
-What's up? What are you doing?
Everything's fine.
I have a dinner with the dealers tomorrow.
-Will you stay there for the night?
-Huh? No, I'll head out tomorrow.
Love you!
-Safe travels.
-Okay.
-What's going on?
-It's nothing. I'll leave it here.
Listen to me, Lucky.
You sit here quietly, okay?
Forget about everything you hear and see.
Good boy.
Door's open, come in!
Brother Nevzat, they're in the lobby.
The girls are here!
Wait, take a photo of me and Lucky
to send my wife before we head down.
Evening delight with Lucky.
Come here, good boy.
-Who's a good boy?
-But I have to tell you something.
I might need Lucky's leash tonight.
All right, all right. Come on.
Let's go.
Go back! Sit down there!
We're kind of regulars here.
We always visit with friends.
Do you play tennis?
I do. Left my racket at home, though.
He got a hair implant.
Brother Nevzat.
Ladies and gents, what a nice evening.
Ertan Ikinci is the name.
-Ertan?
-Yes.
Brother, I just...
I just called you Nevzat.
Okay, we get it. It's about privacy.
Well, I won't bother, then.
Let me sit between you.
-My name is Neco. Have a nice evening.
-Brother Ibrahim.
You know I said my name was Fahri.
Let me rephrase it to Aytac.
Fuck this organization you set up.
Then you must be Ibrahim.
Ibrahim. Yes, honey.
Write my name all over the place. Ibrahim!
-Brother Ibrahim.
-Brother Ibrahim.
-Where are you going? Stay.
-Here is a melatonin cocktail.
Get the fuck out of here!
-He's a little tense.
-It's because of the hair.
-Is there a dog?
-No, of course not. Go on.
You filthy...
Would you like to get lost?
Get tossed? To where?
Brother Nevzat.
-Brother Nevzat!
-Who is it?
It's me, open up.
What do you want?
You know, we talked about Lucky's leash.
What leash, dude?
Are you a pervert or what? Go away!
Damn!
He wore it himself.
Alpay.
Upstairs.
What the fuck?
Hey, good morning. I woke up at 6.30 a.m.
All because of oxygen!
Don't tell me, dude.
Just leave me alone, for God's sake.
-Good morning, Brother Ibrahim.
-Morning.
Isn't Nevzat awake yet?
He must be sleeping.
Where's Brother Nevzat?
Isn't he having breakfast?
Go and check his room.
Brother Nevzat.
Brother Nevzat.
-So, did you get a good sleep?
-I did.
Lucky, open the door.
The dog is in the back. In the garden.
Thank you.
Guys, I think he's in the back.
I'll take a look.
Shut your face hole.
Did he leave you here?
Come on, now. Brother Nevzat!
Come on, boy. Come.
Brother Nevzat. We're waiting for you
to have breakfast.
Where is he?
Brother Nevzat.
Where's your dad, boy? Huh?
Where is he? Come on.
Brother Nevzat isn't around.
He left the dog out.
-What do you mean?
-He's not around.
-Brother Nevzat!
-Brother Nevzat!
-Nevzat!
-Brother Nevzat.
-Where the hell is he?
-I don't know.
Excuse me.
Could you please unlock the door?
Nevzat!
-Did he take a dump here?
-It must be Lucky's.
Brother Nevzat!
-Nope.
-Not in the bathroom.
Oh, the gray-haired gentleman.
I saw him when it was still dark.
He went out early.
-What the fuck did you do last night?
-Nothing, man.
I got an early night.
-Wait!
-Where the hell is this guy?
-He must have gone for a walk.
-So early, at this hour?
Nevzat!
Lucky.
Shut up already! Come here.
Who's he? Is he the guy from the spa?
Huh?
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
This is when the photons are most intense.
The sun rays are horizontal.
So, did you get a good rest?
Mr. Alpay, have you seen Nevzat?
-He didn't come down for breakfast.
-No.
-Let him bark. Let him run around.
-He won't shut up.
I'm calling him, but he doesn't answer.
Brother Nevzat!
What the hell are you doing?
People are asleep.
-Neco, don't let the dog get lost.
-I've got it, brother.
-Let him run around.
-Where the hell is he?
Lucky! Damn!
Lucky.
I own all of this land. I'll build
a waterpark and a thermal park here.
Without cutting a single tree down.
Looks good, right?
Lucky! You filthy beast!
Lucky! Shut up already!
Why are you so loud? Come here.
Come to me.
Come here now. Why are you running away,
you dipshit?
It's okay, Lucky.
Brother Aytac!
That has nothing to do
with my operation, I swear to God.
What the fuck is that?
Let's not get closer.
-Gendarme! I'll call the gendarme.
-Wait! You can't. Wait.
Do you have signal? Nope.
What the fuck is that?
Nevzat?
Nevzat! It's Nevzat. Nevzat!
Brother Ibrahim, if you got me high
on something I swear I'll kick your ass.
Guys, this is wrong. It's my property.
Let's call the gendarme now.
They might end up interrogating all of us.
We'll end up as witnesses.
-We won't.
-Can we please move on?
-Brother Aytac, let's get away from here.
-What?
-We'll end up as witnesses.
-No, we won't.
I... told my wife I was going to
Bursa for a business meeting.
You should've said spa.
You brought me into this mess because
of your sexual desires, you fuckers!
-Are you talking to me like that?
-Don't you pimp women?
-Brother Ibrahim, come on.
-What the hell are you talking about?
We're right under the ship!
Call the gendarme.
Call them and explain it to them.
-Should I call the gendarme?
-Do it.
The whole world will be here
within five minutes!
-Brother Ibrahim.
-We'll save Nevzat.
-Brother, listen.
-We'll save him.
-Don't touch me!
-Brother, please.
-We'll save Nevzat from there.
-Don't go under the ship, just in case.
-Aytac!
-Brother Ibrahim...
Come here. Is that a hatch?
Huh?
Huh.
There is a hatch.
What the fuck are you doing?
Ladder. Do you have a ladder
back at the hotel?
A ladder?
-Take back your words.
-What?
-Take back what you said.
-Okay, Brother Ibrahim. Calm down.
-What the hell are you saying?
-Take it back.
-Mr. Alpay, please. Calm down.
-Just apologize.
Come on, get yourself together.
Let's get away from here, for God's sake.
Just apologize and be done with it.
Brother Ibrahim, please.
Something bad might happen.
Let's get away.
Aytac, find that ladder. Go on.
Hey, Assista! Turn on the TV.
-Nobody knows. Good.
-For now.
Mr. Alpay, these gentleman mentioned
ladders and such.
Yeah...
Are you for real?
All right. Let's go.
Guys, I won't go into the ship
if something bad happens.
I have astraphobia.
What? I haven't even watched E.T.
What lousy luck is this?
Why would they take Nevzat?
There's nobody around, right?
Just move on!
Look, if something bad happens, I don't
know any of you. You checked out already.
What the hell is your problem?
Gendarme.
Let's not do this, please.
The army has taken over.
What do you think, Brother Ibrahim?
Dude, I have to go and talk to them.
You are forcing me
to do stupid things here.
What about Nevzat?
I'll go ahead and mention Nevzat
to the gendarme. Right.
Brother Alpay, okay. I apologize.
Please don't mention us. We're not here.
Okay? Alpay!
Guys, I'm telling you. We'll be fucked.
My wife thinks I'm in Bursa
for a business meeting.
Brother Ibrahim, why do you include us
in your lies?
What are we going to say when we get back?
I won't say anything.
Do not come closer. Stay away, brother.
Good morning. What's going on?
Is there a curfew?
-This place is restricted.
-I heard someone mentioned a spaceship.
Sir, we can't disclose any information.
We're just waiting.
We should've made the move
and saved Nevzat in the first place.
Yes, but how?
There was even a hatch.
-I wonder why they came to Earth.
-Who?
-The aliens.
-Why did they come here?
Why did we come here? You dumb fucks.
What will we say
when we get back to Istanbul?
How will we respond
when Nevzat's wife asks about him?
They have our records everywhere.
We even gave in our IDs at the hotel.
And I told the girls my real name.
All right, brother. Let's wait then.
We can't leave. We can't go anywhere.
-I was out for a morning run...
-Thank you, have a nice day.
Thank you.
No, they know nothing.
It's just the army securing the location.
But this will be a great attraction
for tourists.
Tourism will be booming here next year.
-We have to get Nevzat.
-Are you for real, brother?
Yes.
Everything is on TV.
Okay. No... I was out running.
Okay, I'll be there.
I'll come to the hotel. All right, okay.
What the hell are you doing?
Brother Nevzat didn't answer the phone.
Let's go to the hotel. Nothing to do here.
-Go on.
-Come on, brother.
Brother! What the hell is this?
Don't play with
what you don't understand, dude.
That stuff is everywhere.
The dog just won't shut up.
I can hear groaning.
Nevzat!
Komluk is on total lockdown.
Nobody comes in or leaves.
-The American Secretary of Defense...
-Move.
Come on, keep moving.
Take him upstairs, to my room.
-Mr. Alpay!
-It's fine. Just a minor accident.
Upstairs. Get me some towels!
-Is there a clear image of the ship?
-Upstairs!
I'll kindly ask my cameraman friend here,
maybe he can show you a tiny part of it,
because we're not allowed
to go any closer.
Serious precautions have been taken here.
There will be some comments
from the Americans, here they come.
Ms. Jaclyn, care to comment?
Are you sure these are organic eggs?
Are you fooling us, Alpay?
Go on.
-On the bed.
-Here, come on.
Stop!
He's all wet. Put him on the floor.
-Put him down. Slowly.
-Nevzat.
-Nevzat?
-Here, take it.
Lucky, my boy...
-Brother Nevzat?
-Go on, wipe it.
The whole world is watching Komluk.
The airports around the place
are at full capacity.
-Lucky, my boy. Where's Lucky?
-He's here.
We've made the necessary contact
with the security forces and...
Brother, look. Thank God
we found Brother Nevzat.
Or things would've blown up. Look at this.
Nevzat.
-Look, Lucky's here.
-What happened?
What happened?
I finished the first round
with the lady...
then my head started spinning.
I went down to get some fresh air
and have a glass of water.
I went out and... Shadows, lights
and voices summoned me.
-Lucky!
-He's fine, he's here.
It's okay, brother.
Come on. Let's leave this place, Aytac.
-What the hell?
-Okay, it's all right.
That's... Probably avocado.
He ate some yesterday, right?
Brother Ibrahim.
The lights in his eyes are gone,
did you notice that?
Are we sure he's really Brother Nevzat?
You know, with aliens around...
-What the fuck are you saying?
-Guys, go on. Just leave already.
Look, I don't even expect you
to make the payment.
Just leave my hotel please.
Come on, Brother Nevzat.
Brother Ibrahim.
-What?
-Come here for a second.
Look.
-What the fuck is that?
-How should I know?
-I told you. They put something in him.
-Is it some kind of a chip?
Nevzat, are you okay?
Are you able to stand?
Fine, fine.
Brother Nevzat. Come on.
Let's get dressed.
-Let's get dressed and leave, come on.
-Should we take him like this?
He can't go anywhere like this.
-Lower your head.
-Does it move?
It does.
Nevzat, I'm pulling it out.
Let me know if it hurts, okay?
I'm pulling it out.
-Applying pressure. It's okay.
-Are you okay?
We're playing with the unknown.
Something bad might happen.
What's going to happen, for fuck's sake?
You brought us into this mess.
Why didn't you schedule it for next week?
I've had enough of your whining.
We've been informed that an element
called Californium
was found around the spaceship.
Let me say that again,
a precious element called Californium
was found around the ship in Komluk.
Just one gram of this precious element,
Californium,
is said to be worth 27 million dollars
on the market.
According to the latest news
we've received,
around the ship in Komluk...
Mr. Alpay, I'd like to ask you one thing.
Why do you keep the thing
we pulled out from Nevzat?
-Why the fuck do you care?
-No way.
Why do you act like you own it?
We found it.
-Really?
-Just hold on for a second.
Go and bring Brother Nevzat's clothes.
Come on.
Okay, brother.
-And the phone! Bring the phone, Neco.
-Okay, brother.
Here I am.
-Open it.
-Okay, I got it.
-Here.
-Lucky, just sit.
Shut up, Lucky.
Come on, put it on.
-The legs.
-All right.
What's wrong?
His balls are gone.
-How come?
-Gone.
They're just not there.
I mean his crotch is just...
Is there an incision or what?
No, nothing like that.
-There is nothing there.
-Poor Nevzat.
The aliens must've done it.
What if that happened way before,
Brother Ibrahim?
What do you mean?
Has anyone seen his balls before?
-Why are you looking at me?
-I don't know.
How should I know what happened before?
Maybe we should ask him...
-He noticed!
-Nevzat!
-Brother!
-It's all right.
-Brother, it's okay.
-Your voice echoes in the hotel!
...the security forces here
have taken serious precautions.
The uncertainty of the situation
keeps the curiosity burning.
-Brother, calm down.
-What happened to us, my Alpay?
I deserved this, Ibo.
I deserved this, Neco.
Don't say that, brother. Please.
It's okay. We'll figure it out.
What's going on?
Nevzat, are you okay?
I'm fine, my sweetheart.
I'm fishing here.
Where's Lucky? Show me Lucky.
Is it the end of the world, Nevzat?
Show me my boy.
Lucky is around, honey.
He's somewhere here.
The signal is weak, sweetheart.
I'm losing your image.
I'll call you back, okay.
The whole world is watching...
-Where is Lucky?
-...the ship.
Are they friendly
or do they pose a threat?
A small dog has just crossed the barriers
running towards the spaceship.
The dog is running towards the ship.
And the dog stops right under the ship.
Folks, the dog just got teleported
to the spaceship.
I can't believe my eyes...
What kind of a curse do you have?
Why is this happening?
Don't answer. It's probably the wife.
She must've seen it on TV.
Guys.
Guys, I can't go back home without finding
Lucky first. That'd be my death sentence.
And nobody is going anywhere, understood?
Nobody.
Nevzat, come on, brother. For God's sake.
Look, you got us into this mess
talking about spas and shit.
We already rescued you.
Forget about the dog, brother. Come on.
-I can't go back without finding Lucky.
-Brother Nevzat, are you mad?
Aliens stole your balls
yet you still worry about Lucky.
Look, dipshit. I'm 58 years old.
What could I do with those balls
at this age anyway?
Look, the aliens are on my land.
I haven't even talked to the authorities.
The news mentioned elements and millions
of dollars. Just leave my hotel. Please!
We'll save Lucky.
And you will help me.
If you won't, then I will tell on
all of you! All of you!
What is there to tell on me anyway?
I'm not married.
Shut the fuck up! Don't you jerk off
in the workplace with soft soap?
You. You just stole two radio players
from the depot, right?
-Come on...
-Come on?
If I start talking about Antalya, Side
and the tractor... You know the rest.
Is that a classy thing to say?
This is not Brother Nevzat.
Aliens must've copied him.
We have to rescue Lucky no matter...
Brother?
-Are you okay?
-Nevzat?
Come on.
-What the hell is that?
-Californium.
27 million dollars for a gram.
-We can split it four ways.
-Four ways, why?
Whoever helps me rescue Lucky
from the ship...
can take his share from me.
Stop being so immature, Nevzat.
What the hell are you doing?
Rescuing from the ship?
How will we get into that ship anyway?
Just wait. Forget about the ship.
I'll get some laxatives.
-Come on, brother. Take a seat.
-Come here.
Koray, get me some laxatives.
Something purgative.
It's estimated that there may be
approximately half a ton
of this precious element in that ship.
No fucking way!
Forget about the laxative. Forget it!
The extraterrestrial lifeforms,
that have been around
for thousands of years, once they are...
Gentleman, we can't abandon that good boy,
Lucky, on the ship. We just can't.
That's it. Brother Neco,
go to the front desk, get your IDs.
I'll delete every record you have here.
You just stay put.
I'll go out and explore, okay?
I'll find a way to get into that ship.
That's it. Please just stay put.
That's the spirit.
Fine.
Will Ilber Ortayli be on live TV?
No, the authorities are still silent.
Okay, we are here.
-He just said some nonsense.
-Let me check the details.
Clear the way! Make way!
You'll say the ship is ours.
-There's a girl in charge, from NASA.
-Is she hot?
How can you still ask that? Considering
the mess we're in because of--
Wait, will we say the ship is ours?
What about the aliens?
You are the aliens.
But once we're in the ship,
you'll take the dog and leave.
You won't touch anything else.
That's the only condition.
How will we split the Californium
from Nevzat?
We'll wait for him to take a shit.
We can't do this in broad daylight.
We'll wait for it to get dark.
The girl works alone.
A general is in charge.
The girl is emotional.
It's easy to fool her if you move
at the right time and right angle.
We can have a smooth operation.
-What do you say, Ibo?
-Fuck, with this condition I have...
-Neco, you'll have this.
-Show me how it works later.
-I'll call you two times.
-Okay.
So, how will we become the aliens, bro?
Humor me.
That's easy.
From regional to national.
From national to universal.
Now, I need someone brave
to nail this on the back of my neck.
Hit it.
Okay.
All right, guys. This is the first part.
This felt feels uncomfortably warm.
Is it touching my head?
No, Brother Ibrahim. Nothing is wrong.
It's fine.
I have a phobia of felt, though.
Just cut the crap.
Neco, do you have the phone?
Come on.
What is it, brother?
Sir, these Americans have done nothing.
They've been here for hours.
Okay, we get it. The land is yours.
And you run in the mornings.
Just don't keep us busy. Move away.
Don't be mad, sir.
I'm just angry at the Americans.
-Are you from Tokat, bro?
-No, bro. Please go away.
Okay, that's all right.
I mean, no need to...
-Please go away.
-I just said...
I just said Americans failed to intervene.
That's all.
Why did he give this thing to me anyway?
Tell her. They are in my head.
They are here.
Aliens abducted me.
Look at my head. They are in my head.
Jaclyn Corrado! I will only talk to her.
They are uneasy. Turn the lights off!
Right, brother!
He's calling.
-Come on.
-Move, move.
The president?
Give my best to him.
We are coming from planet Lombus.
There are enough elements
to solve the energy problems
of the whole Earth.
Everyone should move two kilometers away
so that it won't harm anyone.
That's right.
I'm fucking cabbaged here.
They said two kilometers, nobody moved.
They want me.
-The girl is from NASA, right?
-She is. She's really something.
She's in charge of everything.
-Where is the hatch?
-There it is, look.
Lucky! We're here, my boy.
Why would you bring the dog anyway?
-Come on, brother. Neco.
-Here, take it.
Well?
Who goes first?
Don't be so afraid.
Lucky!
Lucky! Come here, my boy!
Come here. Come to Daddy.
Lucky. My boy!
My boy!
What the hell?
Do you remember the price
of a gram of this thing?
There's a lot of it here!
-Let's take it.
-Hold your horses, chief. No taking.
-What do you mean "no taking"?
-We talked about this. No taking.
-What did we talk about?
-You can't take anything but the dog.
That's all right, brother. We got Lucky.
Let's get away from here.
-One second, Nevzat. This is not okay.
-What do you mean it's not?
What did we discuss at the hotel?
Take the dog and leave.
You have nothing else here. You're done.
-Alpay, you can't have it all yourself.
-What do you mean, buddy?
-I say you can't.
-Weren't you begging at the hotel?
-I helped you get in the ship.
-What happened there stays there.
Enough with this nonsense, brother.
Let's get the hell out.
Brother Nevzat.
-It's yours.
-Well, you can take that.
Stop, don't remind me of it.
-Let's take it.
-Too late. It can't be stitched back on.
My name is Thorga.
I come from the Verox Galaxy,
from the Council of Health.
First of all, welcome aboard.
Brother, I can take him down.
-Together!
-I can take him down.
The young ones. The young attack first.
Allow me to adapt myself
to communicate with you.
Brother Nevzat, should I stab him?
No, don't. Wait, wait.
Neco, on three.
Your fear manipulates your actions.
Please don't.
-Three!
-You son of a...
God!
Why are you acting like this?
Violence is not the answer.
Look, I got rid of the cancer cells
within your friend's testicle.
He can have a healthy life
for another 50 years.
And I cleaned the parasites
on your little dog's body.
I came here in peace.
Hear me out before attacking me.
Fundamentally, we are all brothers. What's
the reason for this prejudice and fear?
The ignorance!
-What the fuck did you do?
-It's a registered gun anyway.
I mean...
The hatch closed.
-It won't open!
-Isn't there a lever or something?
Just press some buttons here.
Lucky!
Brother, something has started up.
-Hold on, guys!
-Hold on!
What the fuck is going on?
Brother Nevzat!
Hold on! It's really moving!
It's fucking moving!
It stopped.
It fucking stopped.
You and your fucking actions, bastard!
Bastard? I only sell a lifestyle here.
THE END
Guys, my hair! It's growing!
Why didn't you schedule it for next week?
