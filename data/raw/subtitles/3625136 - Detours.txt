- My husband likes dicks.
- Pricks.
- Cocks.
- Dongs.
- Balls.
And I'm the last idiot
on Earth to know it.
- Well, the sad thing is he
was the next-to-last person.
And I'm sure there
are a few people
in Peoria who don't know yet.
- Oh, I feel so much better now.
- You're really ready
to move on from acting?
- Definitely.
- You okay?
- My husband dumped
me for a guy.
My mom and died and my dad's
barely left the house since.
I think I'm remarkably
upbeat considering.
- You need to get laid.
Yes.
- I've only been
separated for a month.
- But how long has it
been since you've had sex?
A year?
- 13 months and five days.
My birthday.
- Got it.
Well, I'll help you
find someone really hot.
Or at least straight
and seduceable.
- Straight?
That's the baseline now?
Straight.
Are you gonna come visit
me when I move to Florida?
- No way.
- Oh.
Oh my gosh.
- Don't
knock everything down.
- I'm getting a
little excited here.
* Go back to bed
* And start again
* This day's a bust
* I'd rather lust
* Last night's events
* Weigh on my head
- Dad?
You still have that shirt?
- You know your mom
gave this to me.
Right before she died.
- Yeah, well, there's more
tomato sauce than cotton.
- Let's eat.
- It's on the table.
Have you been out at all?
- Went to the
supermarket yesterday.
- That's not what I meant, Dad.
- Have you and Kevin agreed
on terms of the divorce?
- Not quite.
- When do you start the new job?
- Two weeks.
- Nervous?
- No.
Can I make a pot of coffee?
- Sure.
No.
- What the hell, Dad?
- That's your mother.
- You said you were going to
scatter them at
the jersey shore.
- She hated that TV show.
- Well, she doesn't have to
watch it anymore, does she?
- Did you bring any
of Kevin's cookies?
- He still won't
give me the recipe.
- Well, your mom gave it to him.
They were close.
- Yeah, well I should at
least get it in the divorce.
- You don't bake.
Mmm.
Want one?
- Dad, you need to
scatter the ashes.
- I will.
- Dad, her shawl is still on
her chair in the living room.
Florida.
She used to talk about
moving there some day.
- That was my idea,
to avoid state taxes.
- Come with me.
- What?
- Drive to Florida with me.
I could use another
driver, and you could use
to get out of here for a while.
We can scatter the
ashes on a beach.
- I can't.
- You can.
Think of it as a vacation,
like the old days, you and me.
You can bring your video camera.
Mom always wanted
to see Savannah.
- I won't go.
- What about that guy?
The one on the corner
in the blue shirt?
He's kinda cute.
- Stop, I'm not interested.
- Bullshit, you're
just depressed, and
you need to get laid.
- Well, divorce is depressing.
And I don't know what
to do about my dad,
he won't come with me.
- What about that
one over there?
Seriously.
Hm, hm?
- Okay, yeah, he is kinda cute.
- Did you talk to Kevin yet?
- Yeah.
We were having a
nice conversation,
and then when I asked him about
my mom's cookie recipe,
he absolutely refused.
- Well, that's how it starts.
That's' why you need a
good divorce attorney.
- For cookies, Megan?
Any lawyer's gonna laugh
me out of his office.
- Well, first thing we do,
let's kill all the lawyers.
You know what you should do,
you should call my friend, Sam.
This kind of thing is
right up his alley.
Serious.
- Have you handled
many divorces?
- Oh yeah, at least 1100.
I'll give you an exact number.
Oh this is,
case 1451.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
I should be a lot wealthier.
Well,
let's take a moment to meditate
as we ask for divine
guidance and peace
in our forthcoming endeavors.
- Yes, definitely,
peace and guidance.
- Alrighty then.
Let's rip his balls off.
- I'd like to keep it
as amicable as possible.
- Well, I got a phone
call from his lawyer.
- And?
- And he says he won't
give you the recipe
unless you give him
some of the ashes.
- Wow, what a fucker.
Sorry.
- It's okay.
- Hey,
this Jennifer Giraldi,
please leave a message
after the beep, thanks.
- Jenny, it's Dad.
I'll go to Florida with you.
Just tell me when
you're leaving.
- Dad, are you ready?
I know.
No self-respecting thief
- Would steal a TV from
under the American flag.
Oh.
- What's up?
- Gotta get your mother.
Hey.
- Oh, no.
- Good morning, my dear.
We will arrive at
your destination of
2475 Breezeway Blvd,
in St. Petersburg, Florida
in 17 hours and 50 minutes.
- Thanks, Joe.
- Sure, but that
estimate is drive time only,
and doesn't include time
lost for essential activities
such as eating,
sleeping or arguing
about your relationship
with your mother.
- Is he always like this?
Can he see us?
- It's a demo model that one
of Megan's clients developed.
I can't imagine ever going
back to a simpler one.
- My DAAD is
currently .9575.
- DAAD, Destinations Achieved
plus Attractive Detours
expressed as a ratio
to total trips.
One would be perfect,
but Joe is damn good.
- Joe.
- What, Dan?
- Where are your maps?
- I don't have any.
- How is that possible?
- I've got Joe and I've got
a smart phone with a map app.
- I'm getting my maps.
If there's traffic, we
can take the turnpike
south up there, to the right.
- By the way,
traffic this morning
is expected to be clear.
It's good to get
out, isn't it Dan?
- Say goodbye to
Kevin this morning?
- I said goodbye to Kevin when I
caught him in bed
with another guy.
- Ooo.
- I'm gonna miss his cookies.
- Mom's cookies.
- Speed up by three miles
per hour, you can take
the parkway south
instead of the turnpike.
We can catch the 3:45 ferry.
- I prefer the Delaware
Memorial Bridge.
- Take the bridge.
That's a terrific metaphor.
- I think,
- Dad, please.
I'll stop at the next rest area,
and we can get some lunch, okay?
- Next area
is in 10.2 miles.
- I used to have a client
right off exit five over here.
There's a diner nearby.
Can't we just go there?
- Dad, I don't know.
- You'll love it,
the food is great.
- My TITTE ratio is
gonna take a hit on this.
- TITTE?
- Time Traveled to Eat.
It's one of his best metrics.
- Cross this street
to the right lane,
and make the next right.
- When's the last
time you were here?
- Seems like
just yesterday.
- Joe, where's
the nearest diner?
- Make the
next legal u-turn.
And Dan, think
about your tendency
to over-complicate things.
- When's the last
time you went out
other than to the supermarket?
- I've never been social.
You know I like numbers
more than people.
- Have you ever thought
about joining a club?
Maybe try online dating?
- Jennifer, stop.
I can take care of myself.
- I know, I'm just
worried is all.
You're still young.
- Not really.
- Well, you're not old.
- Whatever.
Jen, I wanted to
tell you something
about your mother's ashes.
They're not,
- What?
Oh shit, did they give
you the wrong ashes?
- No, nothing like
that, it's just
I gave some of them away.
- To Kevin, Dad?
- No.
Remember Mary Lou Williams?
She asked if she could have
some of the ashes, I said okay.
- What did she do with them?
- She sprinkled
them on the roses.
- That's
sweet.
- And they all died.
- {Jennifer] Wanna
drive for a while?
- Maybe later.
It's a shame things didn't
work out with Kevin.
- Yep.
- Nice guy.
Your mom and I both always
knew he was homosexual.
- We say gay these days, Dad.
- So, it's like the
African-American, n-word thing.
- Mmhmm, mmhmm.
- The night of the wedding,
your mother, she says to me,
"That Kevin, he's
such a nice boy.
"But he's never going to
make our Jenny happy."
- I got it.
Okay, Dad?
I'm the only person
in the entire world
that didn't see that
he was gay, I got it.
He likes cock.
- Language, please.
- Sorry, Dad.
- How much longer
'til Washington?
- We should hit the
northern tip of the Beltway
in about two hours, why?
- Just hoping to miss
rush hour, no such luck.
- We'd have to get
there at, like,
3:00 in the morning to
miss traffic I think.
- Yeah, traffic
on the Beltway,
it moves slower than a
bill through Congress.
I'll do my best to
avoid the gridlock that,
well, DC's known for.
- Thanks, Joe.
Oh, that's my phone, it's in
my purse, can you grab it?
- It says Tom McKennon,
do you have to take it?
- Swipe it, swipe it.
Swipe it.
- Swipe it.
- Hey, Tom.
- Jennifer, I just
wanted to check in and be sure
you're on your way to
join us in sunny Florida.
- Speeding south on
Route 95 as we speak.
- You'll be here for the
fundraiser next week, right?
- Definitely.
- Looking forward to working
with my new assistant director.
- I am too, Tom,
thanks for calling.
- Bye for now.
- Bye-bye.
Can you just put it in my purse?
- Ah, welcome to Delaware.
- I still remember your
fifth grade project.
You were so cute.
Cutting out the
state from that map,
putting it on the
cover of your report.
- I should have picked a square
state, like North Dakota.
- I never knew why
you picked Delaware.
- This might be
a good time to address
those unresolved issues you
have with this tiny state.
- All I really remember
is that Mom kept calling
to say she'd be home
soon to help me write it.
Buy she wasn't.
- Yes, she was.
- No, Dad, she wasn't.
- I'm sure she wanted to be.
- Not as much as she
wanted to sell her books.
- It's not easy being
a best-selling author.
You can write the best
books in the world, but
you still gotta get
people to buy them.
- About as easy
to get her to come
to one of my plays,
I guess, then, huh?
- And how does
that make you feel?
- I was even jealous
of the people
that got to interview her.
- Grace, you don't mind
if I call you Grace, do you?
Of course not, I'm Barbara.
- I know, dear,
your editor told me.
- Not now, dear.
- You're a real hero of mine.
Is it true you wrote a column
for the same weekly
newspaper as me?
- For many years, yes.
- Wow.
So, where did you get the
idea for A Cook's Tales,
combining short
stories and cooking?
- Well, I used to tell
stories to my daughter
while I was cooking,
keep her entertained.
Writing them down, it just
seemed like the next step.
- Hi, sweetie, what's your name?
- I'm Jennifer.
- Do you wanna be a
writer like your mom, dear?
- Nope.
I wanna be an actor.
- Jennifer, please
wait with your father
while I get done
with this nice lady.
- I loved the book.
- Thank you.
- Pull over.
Pull over, pull over!
- Dad?
- Jennifer, this is Sue.
She's gotta pick up her
son at the preschool,
and it closes in 20 minutes.
Sue, this is my
daughter, Jennifer.
She's getting divorced because
she just found out
her husband's gay.
- Dad.
- Will you stop calling me that?
You know who I am.
- Nice to meet you both.
I really appreciate your help.
- Climb on in.
- Is there room?
- Sure.
- Hello.
- I haven't finalized
the adoption,
and if I leave him unattended,
- That could jeopardize
the final approval.
Go to the next exit, and bear
right at the fork in the road.
- He is good.
Thank you.
Sorry.
- Bye.
- You guys are a life saver.
- No problem, glad
we could help.
- Well, that wasn't bad, like
10 minutes out of the way?
- You know, it would
have been only eight minutes
if you'd have listened to me.
Do you have control issues, Dan?
- I used to never eat like this,
but since I've been on
my own, I can't stop.
- Perhaps it's
a replacement for sex.
- Joe.
We should probably
find a motel somewhere.
- Two miles ahead.
* Caving in
* It's never gonna be here
- Jen?
I'm bursting.
- Alright, take this.
- What you looking for?
- I got this over a year ago,
and I've only used
it a few times.
Now it's really like one of
our trips when I was a kid.
Check it out.
Okay, so you've got self
timer, which is phenomenal.
I don't think your
old one had that.
USB, red eye, flash
level, and if you go here,
look, something called
zebra, I never figured out
what that meant, so do that.
And then, you can film in
black and white, sepia.
- In 20 feet turn left.
In 40 feet turn left.
In 40 feet turn left.
- Joe, cut it out, do you
need me to reboot you?
- Sorry, folks.
It won't happen again.
- That's yours, do
you want me to get it?
- Yeah.
Swipe it.
- Hi Jenny.
- Hey lady.
- How's Route 95?
Did you meet any
fuckable guys yet?
- Megan stop.
I'm with my dad and he's
got you on speaker phone.
- Hi Megan.
- Hi, Mr G.
I'm sure your dad
would agree with me
about you getting banged, right?
- Well, no, she just
- Megan, I told you, I'm
not ready for that yet.
- Uh-huh, you told me.
I totally believe you.
- Okay, goodbye Megan.
- Bye.
- What about you, Dan?
Are you ready to get banged?
- Oh, I love this song.
- What do you think?
- Definitely.
I miss these.
- Really, Dad?
Why don't you tell them
that, and ask for the recipe,
and I'll learn how to bake?
- What does America mean to you?
- History.
War.
All different types of food.
- Can I ask you
what America means to you?
- Sorry, not today.
- Ooo, there's fireworks.
Pull over.
Well, I guess not.
- I love that the
sign gives us choices
between Atlanta, North
Carolina, and Miami.
- Right?
Houston, Juarez, Machu Pichu.
- Hey Joe, are there any good
alternatives for Route 95?
Something maybe a
little more scenic?
- Interstate 40 East
angles south toward the coast.
It ends in Wilmington,
North Carolina,
and connects there
to Route 17 South,
which is quite near
the Atlantic Ocean.
- Perfect.
* Feeling's right
* Only took a spark
to start this fire.
* You're the only
drug who gets me high
* Can't get enough
* You're my pick me
up when I feel blue
* When I'm on the rocks,
you pull me through
- Thanks again, Dad, for
paying off my student loans.
You could have used
the money to retire.
- Glad something good came
from the insurance settlement.
I still don't
understand your new job.
- I'm going to be the
assistant director
of a regional theater
in St. Petersburg.
- I know that's your title.
But what is it
you're going to do?
- I'll help choose the plays.
Some new, some touring
out of New York.
Work on fundraising.
Increasing the audience.
All sorts of things?
- Is that good?
- Yeah, Dad.
It's very good.
- So, no more acting?
All that preparation, auditions?
I guess I just don't
understand why you didn't get
an MBA if you were
tired of acting.
- I wanted to come
at theater from
a different angle, Dad, okay?
And this job gives
me that chance.
- When you were a kid,
I was always so proud, 'cause
I thought you were like me.
- You never told me that.
- Oh, sure I did.
- No, you didn't.
- Well, now I think
you're like your mom.
- Yeah, I don't think so.
- Yeah, I think so.
You're creative like
she was, I'm not.
- Can I ask you something?
How come you and Mom
never had a baby after me?
- We tried, but it wasn't
as easy as we expected.
- Did she have trouble
getting pregnant again?
- We had a baby before you.
Stillborn.
A boy.
- Mom never told me that.
- And then she had
a miscarriage after.
She hated to talk about it.
- Why?
- I think it made her
feel like a bad parent.
- Dad,
I'm sorry that you may miss
out on being a grandfather.
- Did you and Kevin
talk about having kids?
- By the time I
was ready to try,
he was ready to go.
- You don't owe me
grandchildren, Jenny.
- I know.
I know.
But I could adopt, as
a single mom, maybe.
In a few years.
- You could, indeed.
- Recalculating.
- Where are we?
- Recalculating.
- I don't know.
He's been recalculating
for 15 minutes.
- Recalculating.
- Okay, yeah, Joe,
I know, but why?
Where are we?
Recal-recal-cal-cal-cal-calculating.
- Okay, guys, I think we
could all use a break.
- I can drive a few more hours.
We can keep going if you want.
Your way, absolutely.
Reminds me of summer
vacations when you were a kid.
- I always wondered
when Mom would show up.
- That isn't fair.
- It's the truth.
You said yesterday
she'd be here tomorrow.
- I know, honey.
- That's today.
You're too smart for me.
- So,
when is she coming?
- I
don't know, honey.
- That's not
the way it was.
- Jenny.
Hi.
- Look, Dad taught
me to blow bubbles.
- Ah.
I brought the
manuscript with me.
- Do you know how to
blow bubbles, mommy?
- No, honey, Daddy tried
to teach me, but I can't.
Just show what
you're doing, huh?
- Listen, I loved Mom, but
work was most important to her,
and it always came first.
- She loved you very much.
- Writing always seemed
to come so easily to Mom.
- Ten by Grace took her
five years to write.
Her other books each took
her a couple of years apiece.
- I hate that her sales
went up after she died.
- I know.
- I remember that
column she used to write
for the local weekly.
- Nearly News.
- Yeah, right, Nearly News.
She wrote that every
week for 27 years.
- Why didn't she stop once
her books were successful?
- Loyalty.
Mark McGuiness, the
editor, paid her
when nobody else would
even look at her writing.
And,
- And?
- There was something else
going on between them.
- How did I not know that?
Are you sure?
- You were just a kid.
I walked in on them.
- I had no idea.
Dad, how could she?
Why?
- A million reasons.
No reason.
- But you didn't leave.
- No.
- How can you be so calm?
- That was a long time ago.
- I'm sorry, Dad.
- Thanks.
You know what would
be great right now?
A latte with cinnamon
and whipped cream.
- You think we're
gonna find something
like that on this road?
- For a latte, turn
left in zero point six miles.
- I dunno.
- Listen to Joe.
- You are approaching
your destination on the left.
- They walked in.
A good-looking man, dark,
followed by a gorgeous brunette.
Tall, penetrating eyes.
Everything about her said
trouble.
I'm sorry, I'm a writer.
I like to practice my
narrational skills.
- I'm Dan.
Would we have read anything
that you've written?
- Sorry, no, I'm not
published as yet.
- Ah, well.
- But doesn't stop
me from trying.
- No, you have to keep trying.
My mom was a writer.
Her first book was a
collection of short stories
called Ten by Grace, but
she wasn't successful until
- Woah.
You're Grace Giraldi's daughter?
- I am.
- Oh my God.
A Cook's Tales is
my favorite book.
She was phenomenal.
See that?
I drove 75 miles to a reading
at a bookstore to see her.
She passed too soon.
We all lost an awful
lot when we lost her.
- Thanks, Joe.
- Sorry.
Listen, I'm so happy
to meet you both.
Can I get you something?
Coffee, desert?
- Thank you, yes, a small
coffee with milk for me, please.
- Certainly.
- Could you get me a latte with
whipped cream and cinnamon?
- You must think me
a provincial, sir.
Indeed I can.
- Hey, Uncle Joe,
the cookies are ready
if you want to try one.
- Cookies?
- Red
velvet chocolate chip.
- I am in Heaven.
Can I buy the whole batch?
- Really?
- Not for nothing, pal,
but I have never seen
anybody react to cookies in
this manner in this place.
But you're indeed welcome.
Give me a paper bag.
* I remember when I first
came home without you
* I remember how it seemed
* That was way before you
taught me how to doubt you
* That was when I still believed
* But oh, the loss of innocence
* That debt I owe to you
* You taught me
how to trust again
* And then not too untrue
* And I don't blame
the circumstance
* For tearin' us apart
* 'Cause I'm quite sure
it all comes back to you
* It's my responsibility
* To find the happy way
* And when you said
you'd help me, I agreed
- You're not
gonna be coming
to any more Mets games with me.
- We can check out
the Tampa Bay Rays.
- They use the designated
hitter in that league.
- So?
- It's not real baseball.
- That's ridiculous.
- I'm a traditionalist.
- They've been better
than the Mets for years.
Plus, we can check
out the Buccaneers.
- Football should be played
in miserable weather.
- Oh, damn it.
- What?
- Do you
hear that knocking?
- Yeah.
- My mechanic
told me he'd fixed that.
That is so annoying.
Shit.
- Get out!
- Dad, are you okay?
Did you hit your head?
- I'm okay.
That night.
When I got the call.
My worst fears.
I always worried when she
went on those book tours.
I should have been with her.
- Dad, you couldn't
have done anything.
- She was in her car.
Alone.
- I can smell that that thing's
not driving anywhere today.
- I know.
- See, there was this alligator.
- If you could give
us any kind of help,
we'd really appreciate it.
- I can get one of
my guys to tow it.
- Your guys?
- I run an auto repair shop.
Just a couple of
miles from here.
- That's great, yeah.
What should I do with the keys?
- Leave 'em under the seat.
I can drive you all to
a motel if you like.
Rates aren't bad
this time of year.
- Yes, thank you,
we appreciate it.
Oh, Dad.
Thank you so much.
I don't know how to repay you.
- Call me tomorrow.
Will Jackson's Garage?
I thought it was yours.
- Oh, it is.
That's my ex's name.
I started the place
when were still married.
- Thank you.
- Forgot your coffee.
- Ah, jeez.
Thank you so much.
- You hungry?
- Starving.
I'm dying for a shower,
but I'm just gonna have
to put on the same
dirty clothes.
I'm gonna try to get our bags.
- How?
- It's not that far,
Dad, we can totally walk.
- Maybe it's a cellphone number.
- I can see my car.
I want my damn clothes.
Oh, dad, this is kind of loose.
Maybe I can jimmy it.
- I don't think
that's a good idea.
- I'm not gonna steal anything.
- I dunno, Jenny.
- Dad, I did this
like a hundred times
at my apartment in New York.
- Stop right there,
or I'll shoot.
What the heck are you doing?
- I want clean clothes.
- Good Lord, girl.
You could have just walked
next door and knocked,
I would have let you in.
- Annie, I'm sorry, I didn't
know that was your house.
- Car wash and dry
cleaners are mine, too.
In case you were thinking of
breaking into one of them.
- I told her it
wasn't a good idea.
- You run them all by yourself?
- With my partner.
- Hi.
I'm Darlene.
- Why don't you folks come
over for some sweet tea?
Then I'll give you all a
ride back to the motel.
- Oh, we don't want
to put you out.
- What if I put a shot of
vodka in that sweet tea?
- I know I smell, and
I look like shit, but
I feel a whole lot better now.
- Good.
- Can I
ask you a question?
- Sure.
- Do you and Annie
have any problems here?
- Problems?
Doesn't everybody?
- No, I mean, as
a lesbian couple.
- Ah.
- I know I'm being
awfully direct, so,
I'll blame the vodka.
- Okay.
- Listen, I'm not
just being nosy.
My soon-to-be ex-husband
grew up in a town
a lot like this one, and he
finally came out of the closet.
- And ended the marriage.
- Met his dad at the wedding.
- Yeah, his family
is not amused.
- I don't really think
of myself as gay.
I just love Annie.
And folks see what
they wanna see.
- What do you mean?
- We don't kiss or
hold hands in public.
So folks can think
what they want.
They hear us damned
on Sunday, and they
like us fine the
rest of the week.
- What am I missin'?
- Life.
Love.
The usual shit.
* Someday I will make you mine
* Someday we will be just fine
* And you will love me
like you never loved before
* You will love me and
I'll never want for more
* And I will never
break your heart
* We will never fall apart
* And we won't have to hide
the wounds beneath our clothes
* We won't have to, 'cause
there's nothing we won't know
* They won't break us down
* They won't break us down
* Things will come around
* Thins will come around
* Everything will be alright
- You go for a run?
- I just finished.
Any word on the car?
- She said to call
this afternoon.
Feels good, right?
- Sweetness.
- I'll meet you back.
* We could even move
into a small, small town
* And we can teach our kids
the good things that we know
- What can I get you, honey?
- Hi, could I please
get an eggwhite omelette
with seven grain bread
and olive oil on the side?
- You want what, honey?
- Scrambled eggs and toast.
- Coffee?
- Cafe au lait?
- A what?
- Coffee with milk.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Oh.
Megan.
- Hey.
I just have a minute, but I
wanted to give you a heads up.
- Uh-oh, what happened?
- Nothing bad.
Bob O'Connor saw your selfie
and called to get your number.
He left my firm late last year,
and opened up an office
in South Carolina.
- Woman, does anyone
every stay at your firm?
- I did.
- Yeah, that's because
you made partner by 30.
- True.
Listen, he's had a thing
for you since you got drunk
at my Christmas
party two years ago.
- I did not.
- Oh, yes you did, Senorita.
I gave him your number.
Bye.
- Wait, wait, what, Megan?
Oh.
Hello?
Do you want me to
get you something to
eat before I go out?
What's wrong?
- That noise, I thought.
- What?
- It was one of those
devices women use when.
- A vibrator?
Dad, I've been brushing
my teeth twice a day,
and that's what you thought.
- Any news on the car?
- Annie said it will
be ready tomorrow.
I don't even wanna think
about what it's gonna cost.
- I can give you
money if you need it.
- No, Dad, thanks.
You sure you're okay
with being alone tonight?
- I'm just gonna relax.
- Okay.
- This place is pretty good
for Italian food in the south.
I mean, it's not Little
Italy, but it's okay.
- It's hard to ruin
spaghetti and meatballs.
- That's true.
- How did you end up
in South Carolina?
- I grew up here.
- Oh, sorry.
Wow, you don't sound southern.
- Why, Miss Jennifer,
I do declare.
Is that more of what
you were looking for?
- Yep.
- No, I was born in New York.
My dad was working in
the garment business,
and he got transferred
down here when I was eight.
- So, you go both ways?
- I guess I was just
looking for a slower rhythm.
And this town just fit.
- Yeah.
Me too.
Ready, for a slower pace I mean.
Did Megan tell you
I'm moving to Florida?
- Yeah.
She would have enjoyed
our conversation.
- We had a conversation?
- You made it clear
that you had a husband.
- Well,
we're definitely done.
- Well, that's great.
I mean, I'm so terribly sorry.
- I'm
suddenly not all that hungry.
- I'll lose my deposit.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Are you new in town?
I don't think I've
seen you here before.
- No.
I mean, yes.
I'm here with my daughter
on the way to Florida.
Be here a couple of days.
- Welcome.
I'm Beth.
- Thanks, I'm Dan.
- Hope you're
enjoying Myrtle Beach.
- I like it a lot.
- Would you like to dance?
- I dunno.
Rock and roll is more my style.
- Me too.
Might be fun.
- Let's give it a try.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
* You're the drug
that gets me high
* I can't get enough
* You're my pick me
up when I feel blue
- Would you like to sit?
- No.
* I'm looking for your love
* Following around here
* Sort of in this time last year
* I'm still looking
for your love
* Lovin' you made me be
* The best version of me
* Even more than your kiss
* I think that's what I miss
* So, I'm still
lookin' for your love
* Even more than your kiss
* I think that's what I miss
* I'm still lookin'
for your love
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Is anything wrong?
- Nothing really.
My dad just didn't
get back to me.
Morning.
- If you give me a minute,
I'll drive you to your motel.
- It's okay.
Hey Dad.
Shit.
Yes, I'll hold.
- Jennifer.
- Son of a bitch.
- Beth, this is my
daughter, Jennifer.
- Oh, it is so nice to meet you.
- Likewise.
- Beth and I met
at the roadhouse.
She told me how
to country prance.
I haven't had so
much fun in years.
- Sure.
- Your dad is a natural.
- Beth is a math teacher,
isn't that great?
- Like, crazy?
- That's wonderful.
- I'm sorry I didn't call, but
we were having so much fun,
I just lost all track of time.
- Beth, it's nice to meet
you, but would you mind
if I had a moment
with my dad, please.
- Sure, yes.
Call me.
- You are not my boss.
Doesn't look like you were
sitting up all night worrying.
- Yeah, well at least I
sent you a text message.
You just didn't come home.
I'm sorry, Dad.
Did you hear me?
I said I'm sorry.
- I heard you.
- I do think you should
have called, alright?
You'd want the same from me, but
I shouldn't have yelled.
- You've been bugging
me about dating,
and I do, and now
you have a fit.
- Dad, that wasn't a date,
that wasn't getting out,
that was a one night stand.
- If I see her
again, it won't be.
- I just wish you'd called.
- You too.
- I sent you a text message.
- I didn't get it.
- Because you left
your cell phone here.
- Does everybody in
this world have to have
their cell phone in
their face all the time?
- So?
How was it with Beth?
The good news is
the car is ready.
Hey, Joe.
Joe?
- There go my
performance ratings.
- We know it's not your fault.
- We don't have to
stop in Savannah.
- Yeah we do, even if
it's just for a few hours.
Buckle, oh you did.
Well done, Dad.
- I hope you
both used protection.
- Joe.
- You too, Dan.
It's not just pregnancy
you gotta worry about.
Check out the pamphlet
in the glove compartment.
Sorry about the public
service announcement.
- Spanish moss is even
creepier in person.
I mean, not creepy in a bad way,
but not like anything
I've ever seen.
Mom would have loved it.
So, Dad, this is
Sherman's headquarters.
Green Meldrim Mansion.
The owner offered the use
of the house to Sherman.
It's so pretty.
We've got time to
walk a bit more.
- Need a drink.
It's hot in here.
- Mmhmm.
- Where's the bartender?
- What can I get ya?
- Whatever you've got on
tap would be great, thanks.
What's going on with you?
- Should have brought your
mom here when she was alive.
- Thanks.
- Hey, beautiful.
I got something
better for you to do
than drink with this old guy.
Now, you hear me?
I'll take you down
to Chinatown, girl.
What the?
- You had that coming
for a long time, Jimmy.
- Let's go.
- Hey, beautiful.
Oh, I have always
wanted to do that,
but I can't believe
I actually did.
- Careful, next one's
liable to hit back.
- He called you old man.
- Eh, I could have taken him.
Have any more water?
- No,
sorry, Dad, I forgot
to refill it this morning.
- Lemonade.
- Oh, Dad.
- Pull over.
- Good morning.
Welcome to Gourmet Lemonade.
What can I get for you today?
- Aren't you a little old to
be running a lemonade stand?
- Well, sir, the economy
is in a sustained downturn,
with limited upswing
in employment,
so I figured I would
start my own business.
I got an inspiration for
this awesome startup,
but with my student loans,
this all I could capitalize.
- How much for a small?
- Well, these cups are all made
from 100% recycled material.
The lemons are organic,
and I garnish each beverage
with just a touch
of mint and basil.
- How much?
- Well, that small's $2.75,
but for just one dollar more,
you could get a large.
- Kind of expensive, but
okay, I'll take the large.
- Okay, great.
Thank you.
Smell that.
Okay, there you go.
Oh, I'm sorry, I only have
lids for the small cups.
- Why didn't you say so?
- Sorry.
- Tell you what.
I'll take two small
cups, and split
the large up into those,
and then cover them.
- Oh, I'm sorry, I
actually can't do that.
- Why not?
- It'll compromise
my inventory control.
- But it's just you, what
difference will it make?
- Sir, I have big plans
for this business.
I'm aiming for an
IPO in a few years.
Oh, I'm sorry, that's
an accounting term,
you wouldn't understand.
- I am an accountant.
Look, I'll take a big
sip out of the large,
and pour the rest
into the small.
- I'm sorry, that's
against the rules.
Actually, I can't do that.
- I hope you get audited.
Start the car!
- Wait, stop!
Thief!
- Floor it.
- Hey, hey!
- Half my age, he
couldn't catch me.
Ha!
Want some?
It's great.
- No.
You earned that.
- We don't have to scatter
your mom's ashes right away.
- Oh no, we're doing
that together, Dad.
- You wanna drive
straight through?
- Let's
just take our time.
* Beaten path leading nowhere
* To a one way street from here
* The lost can
still be found again
* In this land where
time stands still
- I'm really sorry
this is taking so long.
- Take your time.
Where are you from?
- Queen.
NYC.
We moved here because
my parents thought
that this might be a better
place to run a motel.
Less competition, you know?
That was my dad,
he talks like that.
- Oh, if you need an accountant.
- Dad, please, relax.
- Oh, do you know what
I really want to be?
Not an accountant.
I kinda wanna be a rapper.
- That's cool.
- I know.
My parent's don't
really think so, though.
Do you wanna see,
okay.
* Three, two one.
* Check it.
* My parents don't approve
of my choice of career
* I be good in the hood,
but instead I be here
* Jackson Heights is where
I hail from, born and raised
* I'm so proud of my roots,
the ladies call my name
* Rajiv
* And what
- Nice.
- Thanks.
- Do you wanna rap
professionally?
- Yes.
And I think that would be
a viable career option.
But I decided, instead,
to be a good son
and stay here and help my
parents run the business.
So.
We got it.
Here is your receipt.
- Great.
- And these are your keys.
- Shit, someone stole my car.
- I doubt that.
- What?
- Nobody would steal
your car, honey.
- Then where the hell is it?
It was parked right here.
- Here?
- Yes.
- We stayed right there.
- Ma'am, this area belongs
to the other motel.
The White Sand spaces
are over there.
Your car was probably towed.
You can call this number.
- My mother was in that car.
- You left your mother
in the car overnight?
- No, no, no, her ashes.
- We're scattering
them in Florida.
- They were in a coffee
can in the backseat.
- I'm sorry for
your loss, folks.
Let me see what I can do.
Just give this to the
guy at the tow lot,
and he'll have the
car ready for you.
- $25, seriously?
- Yeah, we do take
credit cards, ma'am.
- You're sure the decimal
points not in the wrong place,
like $250, $2,500?
Thank you.
Thank you.
- No worries, ma'am.
- I figured we'd go to the end
of the pier and do it there.
Okay?
- Perfect.
Thanks for finding this.
- I spent an afternoon exploring
when I came out
for the interview.
He texted again,
asking for her ashes.
- Can I help you folks.
- We were just,
- We were just scattering
my wife's ashes, officer.
Why, is there a problem?
- That's not permitted
on public land
anywhere in the
start of Florida.
- But they're biodegradable.
- It's the law.
Make no mistake, I will give you
a summons if I catch
you doing that.
- Yes, sir.
We won't sir.
- You are allowed to
scatter ashes at sea.
As long as you're three
nautical miles out.
- Okay, thank you.
- Sorry for your loss.
- Well, that sucks.
- We have arrived.
- {Jennifer] Yep.
- Looks nice.
Have the key?
It's nice.
- It's
depressing.
- You can always
buy new furniture.
- Thanks, Dad.
I really appreciate
you schlepping
all the way down here with me.
- Now I can get a
flight out of here.
- No you're not.
You're gonna stay and
help me scatter her ashes.
- Show me what you're wearing
to this Florida fundraiser.
- What?
You really wanna see?
Okay.
Okay.
I'm not totally sure
about this dress.
- You look perfect.
- Thanks, Dad.
- Try this on.
- It's Mom's shawl.
- Got it at a flea market.
- Okay, Joe.
Just a short drive today,
and with a little luck,
this will be our daily commute.
- All of my St. Petersburg
maps have been updated
to ensure the best possible
routes and detours.
I recommend keeping
a bathing suit
in the trunk of the car.
You never know when a beach
opportunity might show up.
And you look great in
a bathing suit, Jen.
- Joe?
Thanks for getting
us here safely.
You did great.
- Oh, you're welcome.
And you know, Dan, I'm
actually gonna miss you.
- Jennifer, I am so sorry
to keep you waiting.
- It's great to see you.
- You too.
- Dad, this is my new
boss, Tom McKennon.
He's the director
of the theater.
- Dan Giraldi,
great to meet you.
- It's good to meet you, too.
- Nice theater.
- You know, it
was built in 1921.
Over a hundred
productions since then.
- I'm done with acting.
- Do you know anyone
who can rent us a boat
to take us out three
nautical miles?
- So, this is it?
- Think so.
- Can I just have
a moment with her?
Wait.
I wanna give some to Kevin.
- You're sure?
- Yeah.
- Ready?
Grace,
I love you.
I really do.
I'll see you around.
- I wish we could have spent
more time together, Mom.
I think we're a lot more
alike than we ever knew.
I love you.
- I have a need.
- Megan.
How's my favorite
hotshot lawyer?
- Hi, Mr. G, I'm good.
How's Jen doing?
- She's okay.
A little nervous.
But her boss is a great guy.
And the weather is wonderful.
- I bought a plane
ticket to visit her in January.
- You're a good friend.
- She'd do
the same for me.
She's done more than that.
You doin' okay?
- Yeah.
I wasn't, but now I am.
- I'm glad.
Take care.
- You too.
- Okay, bye.
- You know, it's
usually the older folks
that move down here from Jersey.
- Yeah.
- Kinda funny, your daughter
moves down here and not you.
- Guess so.
Hey, slow down just a little.
You ever been in there?
- My sister lives there.
- Nice?
- It's beautiful,
it's right on the bay.
- What's so funny?
- There's a lot
of women in there.
You know, divorced
widows most of them.
There's not a lot of men.
* I pulled out at leavin' time
* Uncertain of
which way to turn.
- This is Special Police
Officer Jimmy Beaver.
Jimmy Beaver to Beaver, Jr.
Come in, Beaver, Jr.
- Cut.
- I'd like a chocolate malt
and a small fries, please.
Thank you.
I love her.
If they love you,
they come back.
She's not coming back.
This man is the most
attractive man I've ever seen.
I got nothin', I got nothin'.
Nothin'.
- Cut.
- Who wants a ticket?
No worries.
I don't have any worries.
About anything
* Down the road
* Yeah, leavin'
behind all my regrets
* There's no for
sure if a detour
* Will get you want to go
* Maybe gettin' off
track can be the only way
* Back home
* I've always followed
the road most traveled
* Afraid of going on my own
* But I'm high on this
feeling, hands on the wheel
* And flyin' through
the great unknown
* Tomorrow's sky is blue
* Around every
corner, there's hope
* I can't wait to see what's
waitin' for me down the road
* Down the road
* A brighter day up ahead
* Down the road
* Yeah, leavin'
behind all my regrets
* There's no for
sure if a detour
* Can get you where you wanna go
* Maybe gettin' off track
can be the only way back home
* Down the road
* A brighter day up ahead
* Down the road
* Yeah, leavin'
behind all my regrets
* There's no for

where you wanna go
* Maybe gettin' off track
can be the only way back home
* Maybe gettin' off track
can be the only way back
* Home
