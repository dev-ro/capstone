This will be the last of them now,
Francie.
ls Dad home, Mom? can we go now?
Not so loud, Keeley, do you want to
wake your Papa up?
Gosh, Francie, ain't you through
with them old dishes yet?
She'll only be a minute.
My, l wish he was as anxious to get
going on school mornings as he is on
Saturdays.
Papa was late last night.
Yeah l was dead asleep when he come
in, l guess.
He said if people didn't like to
make speeches so much at dinners,
waiters could spend more time with
their families.
Oh, it wasn't much of a job, l guess.
Them club dinners don't tip much.
ls that all, Mama?
Yes, yes. Go on, l'll dry 'em.
Don't look like you got much there
this week.
One of these days Mrs. Gabish
is going to throw away that
old wash boiler of hers.
Carney will pay us plenty for the
copper bottom off of that.
He won't pay you any more than he
have to.
You watch him on that weighing now.
Yes'm.
Oh, parents ought to have a day
thas like
Saturday is for kids. Go on.
Maybe if l start in the lower hall
and scrub my way up today
ill make something
special out of it for me.
Keep an eye on him, Francie.
Come on!
- Yes, Mama!
They done good today. Come on.
Man throws cigarette
package in gutter,
Francie blocks boy
from diving for it.
Neeley!
All right, pickers!
Come on!
Now look, stand on the same
side as him when he weighs
it so's he can reach it.
And don't forget to stand there
after he pays you.
You forgot that last time.
And a penny's a penny ain't it?
Well, l guess l know what it is.
Well all right then.
Three cents!
Look, that stuff's worth more than
that!
Shut up! l say what things are worth
around here!
Who's next?
Oh, hello little girl! Come on.
Shut up! Shut up!
You done fine.
Nine cents. Three, five, nine...
There you are. An extra penny
because you're a nice little girl.
Thas better. Gosh! l wish Carney
liked to pinch boys.
Nine and my pinching penny.
Thirty nine.
ls a pen setter!
- Ah! No! lt ain't so!
Let me! ...Twenty six!...
A pen wiper.
Something you want, little girl?
l'm merely looking, thank you.
l have a right. l have money.
Step on a crack...
break your mother's back...
Here she comes, Jesus!
Neeley! Neeley, we gotta go home!
Beat it!
Mama said.
- Mama said.
l'll beat you!
Oh, no you won't!
Heaven's sake! ls it that late
already?
Well, l guess l 'll just let these
stairs go'til later.
Four cents, Mom!
Well, thas pretty good. Dump the
bucket, Keeley.
Mama, can l...
No. Dump the bucket and bring it...
Today's the day for the insurance
collector and l sure don't want him
to catch me looking like this.
Hot, ain't it?
Yeah. But Christmas will be here
before you know it.
Got enough troubles without worrying
about that.
How's your sister today, Henry?
Poorly, thank you.
Well, hello, Flossie dear.
Hello, Mrs. Nolan, don't you notice
something?
well, you look like you was feeling
better, much better,
don't she Francie?
No, l don't! l don't!
Heat up the coffee while
l fix supper.
Right there.
Mom!
Yes, Neeley?
Mom, if there was a rule about
something,
that doesn't mean you couldn't do
something else once in a while...
Neeley, you cannot have any of those
pennies to buy an ice cream cone.
They go in the bank the same as
usual. Bring them in here, Neeley.
Half of everything we get goes into
that bank.
Thas the way it is and thas the
way is going to be.
Now put them in there.
Gosh, l bet we got about a hundred
dollars in that old bank by now.
Nine's more like it.
Mama! Mama! They're cutting the tree.
Oh, thas too bad.
That was kind of pretty there with
the bird sitting in it sometimes.
Papa loved that tree.
Aw, quit mooning over it. lt got in
the way of the washing.
Tree ain't gonna put no pennies in
the bank.
Mr. Barker. Get out the good cup
and saucer and give it a wipe.
And Francie,
you can stay in the room if you want
to while Mr. Barker is here.
How do you do, Mr. Barker?
How do you do, Francie?
Mommy is temporarily detained but
will join you directly.
Hello, Neeley.
- Hello.
l might fancy you get manners right
out of the book.
And company or no company,
Mrs. Nolan always looks the lady.
You should see some of my people.
Even ladies with husbands that work
steady.
Won't you go. into the parlor and
have a cup of coffee?
That l will. And your hospitality is
very kind, Mrs. Nolan.
Well, old man Gentry is off to jail
again.
Oh, thas too bad.
But she's keeping up his insurance,
just the same.
And here's ours. Ten cents for me,
ten cents for Mr. Nolan,
a nickel for each of the
children.
And you'll never regret it, Mrs.
Nolan.
A fine funeral for every member of
the family, heaven forbid.
And now your weekly receipts,
Mrs. Nolan.
Now, there's one party, not very far
from here, l wouldn't like to say who
that didn't get any receipts
this week.
And naming no names, l will say that
is a family that the angel of
death has marked on his invitation
list, heaven forbid.
Henny says his sister's got one foot
in the grave.
Neeley!
lll mean problems for you, most
likely. And thank you, Francie.
Well, thas what people get,
wasting good money to give her
dresses instead of insurance.
Dresses thall last longer than she
will.
All depends on what folks thinks is
important.
But Papa says that...
- Thas right, Mr. Barker,
it all depends on what folks
thinks is important.
Oh, and how is Mr. Nolan? ls he
working or not working?
Some tell me one thing, some another.
Of course, l don't listen.
Mr. Nolan being a singing waiter,
Mr. Barker,
and what you might call an
artist, his work don't come steady
like other people.
But l'm sure you'll remember when
you talk to folks
that the Nolans have always paid
their insurance on the dot.
Oh, you surely don't think l go
around spreading gossip
about my clients, Mrs. Nolan
Oh, sure not. And how's my mother,
Mr. Barker?
ln the prime, Mrs. Nolan,
as fine as can be.
And she says to tell you she'll be
over...
oh, over tonight same as usual.
And, l trust you're pleased with the
news about your sister?
Well, just what news do you mean, Mr.
Barker?
Oh, well she must be saving it to
surprise with tonight
when the family's all here together.
l'd take it kindly if you told me
what you mean.
Well, l trot around, same as usual,
to collect her weekly dime
and what do you think happens?
Sell, sir, she gives me two dimes.
Yes, sir, she's done it again.
She's got herself a brand new
husband.
Oh, no.
Well, now, l suppose you mean about
her still being married.
l don't mind saying, l had the same
thought myself.
But, l'm sure it must be all right.
She must have made some arrangement.
l'm quite sure she did, Mr. Barker.
l'm sure that anything...
Does she call this one Bill too?
You children run along now and do
the marketing.
Go on, take some money
from the cup...
Oh, but Mom, l want to hear about...
Take the money from the cup and get
a five cent soup bone off of Haslin.
Don't get the chopped meat off him,
though.
He grinds it behind closed doors,
and heaven only knows.
Go to Werner's for the meat.
Ask for round steak, chopped,
ten cents worth.
And don't let him give it to you off
the plate.
And ask him to chop it in.
And then just at the last ask for a
piece of suet to fry it with.
But he won't always do that, Mama.
Tell him your Mama said.
And then go for the bread.
ls Saturday, Mama, and...
All right, ask for a nice pie,
not too crushed. Now, go on.
But, Mama, we know Aunt
Sissy's been married before!
Thas not...
- Sure. l can remember two Uncle Bills.
Thas nothing for you to talk about.
Now run along now and get things
done.
You got no right, Mr. Barker,
to be carrying tales about
my sister as though.
there were something wrong.
She may be funny some ways, but she
wouldn't do nothing wrong.
So, l'd like it if you didn't talk
to people like it was.
Strike nee dead if l'd ever think of
mentioning it to anyone but you...
Yeah, sure, l know.
Well, you might as well go on now
and tell me what you do know.
No point in my being the only one
that don't hear it.
Well...
Ten cents worth of round steak, do
you want it ground?
No, thank you.
- You sure?
lt wasn't twenty minutes ago l
ground that whole plate full fresh.
No, thank you.
Oh, l forgot, now. My Mama wants it
ground.
You don't tell me.
And she said to chop that in with it.
She did?
And a piece of suet to fry it with
Mama said.
Sweet jumping chrystophers.
You know? Mama thinks we don't know
anything.
Yeah, she acts like we were kids or
something.
l bet she has a fight with Aunt
Sissy tonight.
ls got something to do with men
liking Aunt Sissy too much.
Well, Papa says we oughta make
everybody like us.
l guess maybe ladies shouldn't.
Maybe Aunt Sissy wouldn't have
changed husbands too much if any of
her babies would have lived.
She's crazy about babies.
Look who's talking about babies.
A lot you know.
l know as much as you do.
You don't know nothing.
You think you're so smart.
Boys make me sick.
Well what do you think girls make
people?
Here she comes!
Six loaves!
And a pie, not too crushed.
Breaïs fine.
l wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't
more than three days old.
ls that all, Mom? Can we go now?
Yes, you're free.
Where's the fire?
There's a scout for the Brooklyns
tomorrow.
They're looking for a catcher.
Where are you going?
Oh, no place much.
Well, don't go dream-walking,
crossing the street.
T... U... Burton:
"Anatomy of Melancholy".
Burton: "Anatomy of Melancholy"
Burton's "Anatomy of Melancholy"?
Are you sure you want this?
Yes, ma'am.
Don't you think is a trifle over
your head?
Yes, ma'am.
Then why did you select it?
Well, l've read all the authors
beginning with "A",
and all the "Bs" down to Burton.
ls next.
You mean you're trying to read your
way straight through the library?
Yes, ma'am.
But, a book like this, you'll only
be confused.
Please, l want to read clear through
the alphabet.
l want to know everything in the
world.
Well, all right. Only, do something
for me, won't you?
Take another book too. Here:
"When Knighthood Was in
Flower". Just for fun. ls Saturday.
l'll have a headache thinking about
you wrestling with
"The Anatomy of Melancholy"
all weekend.
Will you?
Yes, ma'am.
A little more to the left,
Mr. Crackenbach.
You think l want to see me clothes
hanging with your wash up there!
Don't you forget to fix mine,
Mr. Crackenbach!
Maybe you'd like to come up here and
fix it yourselves.
And thas just what you'll be doing
if you don't shut up!
Mr. Crackenbachl...
...a wheelbarrow, through streets
broad and narrow, crying cockles
and mussels alive alive oh.
l won! l won!
Well, now, l wouldn't be too sure
about that if l was you.
But l did. l got it open before you
finished and thas the rule.
But l came up one flight two steps
at a time before l remembered.
Don't that make a difference?
No, sir. The rules say that
And in a manner of speaking, you
never did stop me at all,
because my heart kept right
on singing.
Papa, you're joking.
Well, l guess l'll let you get away
with it this time, Prima Donna.
And where's your beautiful Mama?
Finishing the hall.
She must be on the top floor or
she'd have heard you.
Well, in that case, why aren't you
getting busy?
Why aren't you laying out my
clothes?
Oh, Papa, you always make fun. You
know you haven't any more clothes.
Haven't any more clothes, huh?
Whas this?
A tie.
- And this?
A dickie.
- And this?
An apron.
- Well, them's clothes, ain't they?
And you'd better be getting that
apron ironed too.
Oh, Papa, you've got a job for
tonight?
You see the palm of that hand?
Thas right where l got the world
tonight.
Where's the job, Papa?
Klompers. A big wedding party.
And you know something, Prima Donna?
There'll be plenty of tips.
singing or waiting?
- Both.
Oh, maybe tonighll be it. Maybe
tonight he'll be there.
The impresario.
And he'll hear you sing, and he'll
put you on the stage!
And why not? Ain't l the Brooklyn
Thrush?
Oh, Papa!
And now you'd better be getting my
apron ironed.
Have it in a jiffy, Papa. The
coffee's on.
Thas my Prima Donna. Early one
morning, l heard a maiden singing.
Ear... Pst! Pst!
Oh, Papa, l can't sing.
Come on, now, you're holding up the
singing!
"Oh, don't deceive me, oh, don't you
leave me."
And better singing l never did hear.
l love to iron for you, Papa.
You know, something?
A day like this is just like
somebody gave you a present.
Everything just right.
l wonder what people did before they
invented coffee.
Oh, this sure could be a fine world,
if...
Hey, you know something, Prima
Donna?
You're going to make somebody a
mighty fine wife, some day.
Oh, Papa.
And mighty pretty, too. That is, if
your nose doesn't grow crooked.
Could it really? Honest?
Oh, no! ls the prettiest nose in
all Brooklyn.
Oh, Papa, it isn't.
- who says it isn't?
You just tell me who said it and
l'll take care of 'em.
Papa, you're crazy!
And you know something else?
You're not going to be ironing like
this when that impresario
comes along.
Things are going to be different
around here, you wait and see!
Yes, Papa.
Hey, whas the wish you wish the
most when our ship comes sailing in?
Well, it already came true.
What is it? Come on and tell me.
Well, l wished that when you came
home today, you wouldn't be sick.
Oh, who told you to call it "sick"
baby?
Ah, you shouldn't waste your wishes
on things like that!
You should be saving 'em, for a silk
dress or something.
Haven't you got a better wish than
that?
Well...
- Come on!
Well, l hope Mama won't be too mad
with Aunt Sissy.
What about Aunt Sissy?
She's gone and got herself another
husband. Again!
No! Oh, oh, no! Gee, if there isn't
a woman for you!
Hey, what did -what did your Manna
say?
Well, she didn't like it.
- l can imagine that.
Couldn't you say something to her?
Not to be too mad to Aunt Sissy?
That l could, Prima Donna, and that
l will.
Oh, thank you, Papa.
Now, haven't you got just one little
wish for yourself? Just one wish?
Just for you.
Well... Did you see it, Papa?
- What?
Out the window. Our tree. They've
killed it!
Well, would you look at that now?
They didn't have any right to kill
it, did they, Papa?
Oh now, wait a minute. They didn't
kill it.
Why they couldn't kill that tree.
Honest?
Oh, why sure, baby.
Don't tell me that tree's gonna lay
down and die that easy.
Look at that tree, see where is
coming from?
Right up out of the cement.
Didn't nobody plant it.
lt didn't ask the cement could it
grow.
lt just couldn't help growing so
much it
pushed that old cement right
out of the way.
Why, when you're busting with
something like that,
can't anybody help it.
Like... Like that little old bird
right up there. Listen to him.
He didn't ask anybody could he sing,
and he certainly didn't take
any lessons.
He's so full of singing, is just
got to bust out someplace.
Why they could cut that old tree
right down to the ground
and a root would push up
someplace else in the cement.
You wait till Spring, Prima Donna
and you'll see.
Well, this ain't winning the family
bread, huh?
Come on, ain't you got one nice
little wish just for yourself?
No, Papa. l just...
- Just what?
l just love you so much, Papa.
Well, what do you know.
Listen, if l make a lot of tips
tonight, you know what l'm gonna do?
What Papa?
l'm gonna put two bucks on the nose
of a horse l know is running Monday.
And l'll win ten. Then l'll put it
on another horse.
And if l use my head, and l'm lucky,
l'll run it up to five hundred bucks.
Then you know what l'm gonna do?
- What Papa?
l'm gonna take you on a trip. Just
you and me, on a regular train.
Maybe we'll go down south and see
the cotton.
You know, down where then cotton
blossoms blow?
"Way down upon the Swannee River...
Far, far away..." You're a nice girl,
baby.
come on, we'll go up and tell your
Mama the news about my job.
Anybody seen Johnny Nolan's wife?
Johnny? You all right?
And why not?
Ain't l married to the most
beautiful lady in all Williamsburg
Brooklyn?
Well, you're shouting so that
they'll hear you over to Manhattan.
Now, don't you get fresh with me
tonight, Mrs. Nolan.
lt happens l'm working. Klomper's.
Big wedding party.
Well, l thought you looked kinda
extra dressy.
l guess you won't get home until the
sun comes up.
The later the better.
The more tips, the more fine silk
stockings for my wife's pretty legs.
Oh, silk stocking's is just what l
need.
Now, just wait a minute, Mrs. Nolan.
Ain't you gonna give me a kiss for
luck?
oh, the whole house is looking.
Sure, l know they's looking, but who
cares.
This is the finest job l've had in
months.
Maybe l'll get more from tonight.
Well, you'd better get on with it.
Good jobs don't wait.
But the job's no good without your
kissing me.
Well, you still got away with you,
Johnny Nolan.
Now go on, get out of here.
Before you know it,
the folks at that wedding
will be an old married couple.
Before you know it, l won't go at
all.
There's ain't the only wedding that
counts.
Take your hat arid get out of here
before someone else cops that job.
Our, ah, Francie tells me that
Sissy's gone and done it again.
Well, maybe he's a nice fella.
Don't be too hard on her, huh?
They was all nice fellas. Beat it?
now, Johnny.
Well, thas just a sample, madam.
lf you like my stock, drop me a card
and l'll be back again.
Good evening!
Well, would you look at our
beautiful princess tonight
in a brand-new gown.
ls made out of silk.
Silk? Oh, don't you tell me that.
This dress is made out of flower
petals and birïs wings
and a little old piece of cloud.
Anybody can tell that. Oh, good
evening, Mr. Spencer.
Working tonight, Johnny?
Yeah, big wedding party. Oh, good
evening Miss Lizzie, Miss Maggie.
You're looking fine today,
indeed you are.
Thank you, ladies. Here comes the
Bride. HereGood evening, ladies.
Good evening!
Allow me, Princess.
Hi, Mr. Ching.
Hello.
Was did Mom say about Aunt Sissy?
Now don't worry about it,
everything's going to be all right.
Your Aunt Sissy's a fine woman,
Francie. Look at them things!...
There's no use talking. Some day l'm
gonna buy you them skates.
Mama says not to be too late, Papa.
Look, God invented time and when he
invents something,
there's always plenty of it.
There's your car, Papa.
Boy, look at them knives!
Mama says time is money.
Well, l guess he wasn't worrying
much about money right then.
There's your car, Papa.
Well, l might as well catch it.
Supper's ready.
Y Hey, am l hungry!
And when weren't you hungry?
- Mama?
Yes, Francie.
- what does white mean?
Oh, just white, l guess. What do you
mean, what does it mean?
Neeley, sit down at your place.
Well, why do girls always wear it
when they're married,
and when they're confirmed
and when they graduate?
Why does it always have to be white?
Just one of those things somebody
started. Lots of things like that.
Will l have a white dress when l
graduate?
We'll see. Neeley will probably have
to have shoes by that time.
But, Mama!
Well, talk to him about it.
lf you can get him to quit coming
through the soles of his shoes...
Just because he's a boy.
All right, Mama, l will gladly do
without so my little brother can be
happy with new shoes.
Little brother my eye...
That will do. Francie, you read too
much.
Hey, Aunt Sissy!
- What did you bring us?
l brought myself chickapeas, isn't
that enough?
Oh, and a couple of magazines from
the dentist.
Whas he need 'em for, or me
either?
l can't read like my educated little
niece here.
Hello, Katie, my darling.
Good evening, sissy.
Well, you look fine, Katie.
Yeah, l look fine.
Who spilled the beans. Oh, l forgot,
it was old Barker's day here.
Where's Johnny? l was kinda counting
on him to be in my corner.
Oh, sure. You and Johnny.
Oh, look, Katie.
l didn't tell you because l wanted
to bring Bill around.
But, l couldn't. He's home sleeping.
He's a milk man, you see.
Ah, listen. You're gonna wish me
happiness, ain't you?
Naturally, l'm going to wish you
happiness this time too.
Oh, golly, why can't you skip to the
part where you forgive me?
You're going to before you're
through.
You know l'll get around you in the
end.
Why can't you just be human now and
get it over with? Huh?
Oh, there ain't no one like you to
get around
a person in the whole world.
Unless is Johnny. You're in time
for pie. Go on now and sit down.
Well, thas more like it. Thas my
kid sister talking.
Just coffee for me.
l gotta get home soon and fix
breakfast for Bill.
Breakfast? At night?
- Yeah. Ain't it a riot?
We sleep all day long with the
shades pulled down
to keep out the sun.
And the window shut to keep out the
noise. ls fun.
You don't live like nobody else.
No, you sure don't.
Easy on the whip kid. Now, wait til
you meet my Bill.
You and him will be...
Wouldn't you marry nobody if they
wasn't named Bill, Aunt Sis?
She might not remember them if they
wasn't.
Oh, Bill's got some other names.
Steve, l think it is.
But l always like Bill.
A good man's name with no stuck up
about it.
Oh, you'll be crazy about him, Katie.
Yeah? But the question is, how will
him and you get along?
Oh, is wrong, Sissy, l mean, the
others...
The others was wrong.
Whas right about keeping on with a
guy you don't love each other any more?
But it ain't as easy as that!
l think Aunt Sissy's right about
when love is dead.
Now look what you started.
lt ain't nothing to talk about in
front of them.
Every time you come here you fill
their heads with...
Go on downstairs for a while kids.
Your Mama's got a spanking up her
sleeve and
she ain't gonna feel
right until somebody gets it.
Might as well get it over with...
oh, you don't want to frown like
that, snuggle puff.
The fellas don't go for that at all.
All right, kid, les have it. The
works.
l'm a disgrace.
You don't know what to do with me.
You can hardly face the neighbors
with what they must be saying.
l'm old enough to know better.
Go on, get it all off your chest, then
we can make up and forget about it.
Thas right. Talk your way out of
it. You probably will, too.
Whad Mama have to say?
Well, you know Mama,
she don't say much.
Oh, sure, l know Mama.
Says that you're bad, only where the
men are concerned but
she's good in her heart.
oh, but that ain't it, Sissy.
People got a right to talk, and the
kids are bound to hear,
and it ain't right for them.
And you can get in trouble.
You ain't real sure what happened.
And there's laws about things like
that...
Katie, so help me, this time is
for keeps.
l ain't even gonna look at another
guy.
And as for the last one, he can't be
alive,
or l would have heard from him.
l've been pretty good.
Seven years is a long time to wait
around not being married.
They said all you had to wait was
seven years. And l waited.
Well, for the life of me, l don't
know what you're trying to talk
yourself into, but l got a feeling
it ain't right.
All l know, is it can't be wrong or
l wouldn't feel like l do about it.
l'm dumb, sure, but l know this much:
lf l feel bad about something,
is wrong.
lf l feel good, is right. You
wouldn't get it, Katie.
You've got all the breaks
l've never had.
You got the kids, you've got a kid
you're clear overboard about.
You're lucky.
Yeah, and where does crazy over
somebody get you?
lt don't put no pennies in the bank.
lt don't buy no clothes for the kids
to go to school in.
Maybe you got it better not sticking
to one guy.
l wish sometimes
l wasn't so crazy over him.
Hey, Katie.
l won't have the kids taking after
him either.
Him and those dreamy ways of his l
used to think were so fine.
Not if l got to cut it right out of
their hearts!
ls what are you saying?
l don't know.
Yes you do, you're saying plenty.
Whas happened between you and
Johnny?
l don't know what l'm saying. l E
don't know whas come over me.
Well, look, hon, is time we found
out.
Sure, we got something to talk about
now.
l don't want to talk...
Ah-ah! You're the kid sister, you
listen now.
You was awful crazy about Johnny.
Don't tell me, l seen ya.
lt was like every woman wants to be
with a guy.
All right. Maybe Johnny didn't turn
out just like you figured.
Sure, he drinks and all, and you're
the one who's had to make most of
the living but, but, everybody's got
something.
And you wasn't crazy about Johnny
because he was going be a banker,
it was on account of...
Well, on account of how he laughed
and how you felt walking down
the street holding on to him and
having other women look at you.
Aced the way he could, the way he
could talk about things.
And the way he has of saying hello
to everybody, like...
like he was giving
away something.
Thas what you was crazy about,
and that ain't changed!
l don't know.
Them things couldn't change in
Johnny, even if he tried.
He's just different kinda, he always
was.
But he ain't changed.
lf there's been any changing hon,
maybe is you.
You still got all he was crazy over,
ain't you?
Yeah.
Then thank your lucky stars for what
you got, Katie Nlolan,
and take the rest along with it.
And you got a lot, you can take it
from me.
And don't think you haven't.
Well, l mighta known, starting out
to take you apart,
l'd wind up with
you making me over.
Nice going.
Don't stir yourself, pal. Thank you.
Gotta go inside, Alfred.
How'd you come out, Aunt Sis?
No decision, it was a draw. Your
mom's bark is worse than her bite.
Look, tell me something.
When Papa's home, l bet, l bet him
and Mama laugh a plenty, don't they?
You know, like they always did?
Sure. Pop can snake anybody laugh
when he wants to.
Except when he's drunk.
Sick, Neeley! Mama said to call it.
Okay, sick then.
Look, hon, l'll tell you what you
can do for me.
Do all the laughing you can.
You know, keeps everybody healthy.
Okay.
Laughter is the singing of the
angels.
You're a funny kid. Head full of all
them things. Kinda like your pop.
She tells lies like Pop too.
He does not tell lies!
Well, l don't know what you call
them.
Time out! Had enough battling to
last me for today.
Where'd you get the skates?
Oh, they aren't ours. Papa said he'd
get us some though.
Oh, he didn't mean it, he just said
that.
He did too mean it, Neeley, Nolan,
and
Easy now! Kinda like your pop,
don't you hon?
He does mean it, doesn't he, Aunt
Sissy:?
Sure he means it. He means it,
every word.
But, well you know,
sometimes things happen.
But it kinda ain't his fault.
l tell you what.
Les make up like Johnny gave you
them skates like he said.
And they're yours.
Ain't gonna hurt nobody.
Oh, Aunt Sissy
No sense in those things standing
around, nobody using them. Come on...
Here we go. Easy now.
ls that fun?
Can l put them on next, Aunt Sissy?
Sure you can.
Mom! Mom! Mom! You come back here!
You bring back my daughter's skates!
You was the one that put them kids
up to it!
Easy now, nobody's hurt, we only
borrowed them.
She's not going off with them, Effie.
Don't you dare take up with that
woman, like that you...
You poor little guy, do you have to
put up with that all the time?
Hey, Officer! Come on over here,
now this woman here she tried to...
Easy, easy... Take it easy.
Oh, l'm sure glad you came along,
handsome,
you look like you could
whip a bunch of women into line.
Well, thas fine, but now suppose
somebody tells me
what all the excitemens about.
Look, she tried to steal my little
girl's skates.
She tried to grab her...
We only borrowed them for just a
minute, honest.
Thas right.
There wasn't nobody using them and a
little fun and frolic
on a Saturday never hurt nobody.
Bet you know all about that don't
you?
lf you think you're gonna get out of
it, making eyes at the law...
l don't know what the worlïs coming
to!
Get back a little bit, buddy, huh?
This lady is my sister, she didn't
mean any harm.
l'm quite sure she didn't.
Ah, well... As far as l can see
there's been no harm done.
Now, just break it up, run along, go
to your homes.
Go on, you too. Go on, buddy, run
along.
Ah, now suppose l see you women to
your home.
Thanks, handsome.
My sister's always trying to be
funny, officer.
She don't mean nothing by it.
l'd like you to know, this is the
first time that of my of my family
ever got in trouble in the street.
...And l'll see to it that it don't
happen again.
l guess l know a lady when
l see one ma'am.
l'm glad l've been of service to you,
ma'am.
He sure take a shine to you, Katie.
Go on, who'd look at me.
He would.
Funny, sometimes you kinda forget
you are a woman.
He wasn't going to arrest us, Mama.
Aunt Sissy talked him out of it, and
we got to skate on them anyway,
didn't we, Aunt Sissy?
You go inside and tell Sheila and
her Mama you're sorry.
Do l have to, Mama?
l don't like to say to you what l'm
going to, Sissy.
Oh, golly, are we going to start
that again?
You're the only sister l got.
l don't care what people say about
you for myself.
But l got the kids to think about,
and if l don't think about them,
nobody will. You're...
Well, you're bad for them,
Sissy.
What are you trying to say, kid?
l don't want you to come around here
no more.
My minïs made up so don't try to
change
it with any of that
soft talk of yours.
Well, l won't Kate,
not if you mean it.
But les keep on talking about you.
Sofs one thing, but harïs another.
All right, it ain't nice to be hard.
But my kids is gonna be somebody if
l gotta turn into granite
rock to make 'em.
Oh, l wish you hadn't said that, kid.
...Bye, Katie.

Okay, thas the end of the page.
Troylis: And dreaming night will
hide our dreams no longer.
l would not from thee.
Cressida; Night hath been too brief.
Troylis: be shrew the witch with
venomous..."
Oh, that ain't even English!
lt is too. Shakespeare wrote the
best English of anybody.
All right, you tell me what it means,
you're so smart.
l didn't say l know what it means. l
said l liked it.
Thall do.
okay, but l bet you don't know what
it means either.
Maybe not, but l do know is good
for you.
"...be shrew the witch with venomous
white..."
She don't know what it means, Mom
don't know what it means,
Grandma can't even read, and gosh
knows, l don't know what it...
Mama, l can't read if he...
Just wasting time every night
reading stuff
nobody knows what is all about.
Now listen.
Your Aunt Sissy brought that bible
all the way from Sheepshead Bay.
And your Papa blew in all his tips
one time on that Shakespeare,
cause Grandma said they was the
greatest books and you should read
from them every night. So,
you ain't gonna waste 'em.
l don't know, sometimes it does seem
kind of foolish.
But it might get you somewhere.
Might even get you a job someday.
Who can tell?
This reading will not stop.
l say this thing.
To this new land, your grandfather
and l came, very long ago now.
Because we heard that here is
something very good.
Hard we worked. Very hard.
But we could not find this thing.
For a long time, l do not understand.
And then l know.
When l am old, l know.
ln that old country, a child can
rise no higher
than his father's state.
But here, in this place, each one is
free to go
as far as he's good to
make of himself.
This way, the child can be better
than their parent
and this is the true way
that things grow better.
And this has to do something with
the learning,
which is here free to all people.
l who am old, missed these things.
My children missed these things.
But my children's children shall not
miss it.
This reading shall not stop.
And you, Katie, it is not only for
the job that this is good,
but for the true things
inside of us.
You don't think well about this.
Nor about what you do with your
sister.
You have forgotten to think with
your heart.
There is a coldness growing in you,
Katie.
"Be shrew the witch with
venomous white she stays,
as tediously as hell, but flies the
grasps of love..."
"ln Dublin's fair city, where girls
are so pretty,
l first set my eyes
on Miss Molly Malone.
And she'll wheel a wheel barrow,
through streets broad and narrow,
crying cockles and mussels alive
alive oh.
Alive alive oh, alive, alive oh,
crying cockles and mussels...
ls all right, Mama, l don't think
he's sick.
Alive alive oh, alive alive oh...
Papa!
well, what do you know, if it ain't
my beauty.
Hey, what are you doing up this
time of night?
Oh, l just made up my mind to wait
up for you.
l guess l ain't used to the hours
anymore.
No, leave it, is nice.
Go on. Francie, coffee.
ls it something to eat, Papa?
And what else would be coming from a
grand banquet?
l got some fresh rolls,
a whole half a broiled
lobster from the shores of Maryland,
fried oysters, caviar from far off
sunny Russia,
and cheese from the mountain
passages of la belle France.
What do you know about the mountain
passages of France?
ls it better coming from there,
Papa?
Oh, is supposed to be mighty good.
but coming home like this,
l know thas good.
Well, les eat it. No reason we
shouldn't have a party of our own.
l'm hungry.
ls that all you got to say to your
Papa?
Hello, Pop.
His stomach's like the lrish Sea. No
bottom to it.
Mama, your wedding comb.
Well, ain't this a kind of wedding
party?
You bet it is. l wish l coulda
swiped some champagne.
Oh, no l don't. Coffee's better.
But, look who's telling me l don't
know about those mountain
passages of France.
Oh, that.
Yeah, that. lmagine you forgetting.
Well, l didn't forget, not exactly.
Only it was a long time ago.
What do you think of a Mama that
forgets
where she went on her honeymoon?
Did you really go there, Mama?
of course not, your Papa's joking.
Sure we did. Or just the same as. We
spent our honeymoon in a school.
lt was as big as a palace.
We just worked there nights, the two
of us, cleaning.
lt was right here in Brooklyn before
you was born.
That ain't what you told you then.
You mean to say that when we was
having our supper there alone,
and l used to pull down them maps
and take the teacher's pointer
and pick out the places we'd pretend
we was that night.
You mean to say we really wasn't
there?
You mean you forgot that sunny
France was where we liked the best?
And all the laughing we used to do
there?
You're going to sit right down and
tell me we really wasn't there?
Well, l guess we was kind of at that.
And you're going to tell me l don't
know about them
mountain passages of France.
Katie Nolan, l'm ashamed of you.
Wasn't there nobody in the school
but you, Papa?
No, sir, we had the whole place to
ourselves...
or he'll have you believing
you was in France, too.
No, Papa, talk some more.
Whas this here stuff?
Caviar. That comes all the way from
Russia. Them's fish eggs.
Fish eggs!
Yeah.
l never could get it why they like
it myself,
except that is hard to get
and costs a lot.
And that makes it good, Papa?
What about the Russians? lt ain't
hard for them to get.
Do they like it?
Well, can you tie that? Now, ain't
we got the smartest kids?
Papa, talk some more.
Tell us all about the party, and
don't leave out anything.
Oh, that can wait. Here... how's
that?
Three dollars. Thera's good wages.
And good tips, too.
Papa, start. Was there music, and
did they dance?
Aw, your mother's got no time for
all that.
You could tell me. You used to.
Well, it was kind of nice. Klompers,
their best room.
And all fixed up with white flowers.
There was flowers on the table,
flowers on the chandelier,
and even on the floor.
And here was a great big horseshoe
table,
with lots of people all around.
And right in front, a great big
wedding cake,
it must have been three feet tall.
Why didn't you bring home some of
that?
Was the bride pretty?
Well, she was maybe not so young,
but the...
Oh, sure, she was beautiful, in a
blue dress and all and she had
diamonds on her fingers and in her
ears, and she glittered sort of.
And when she walked, her dress
swished, kind of.
And the champagne just flowed like
water.
The smell of it got all mixed up
with the flowers.
And the powder the ladies wore.
And it made a wonderful new perfume
that oh,
made you feel good just
to smell it.
Did you sing for 'em Papa?
Oh, l was coming to that.
l got three encores for my "Wild
lrish Rose" and everybody clapped
And then l sang "lrish Eyes are
Smiling" four times.
Oh, it musve been awful nice.
lt was all right, and when it come
time for them to cut the cake, the
band played "Kiss me Again", she put
her arms around him and boy
did he look scared.
What was he scared of, Papa?
Huh?
You kids ask too many questions.
You heard the story, now go on and
go to bed.
lt must be three o'clock.
l got a belly ache.
Well, lay on your right side.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Neeley.
Good night, Francie.
Francie's kind of mad at me,
because, well,
Sissy made a scene
on the street today,
and l asked her to stay a...
way.
Papa, wasthere an impresario there?
No, not tonight, Prima Donna. But you
got no call to be mad at your mama.
She's always got a good reason for
what she does.
Good night, Mama.
Oh, good night, Francie.
Johnny, tell me what else happened
at the party?
Well, it was nice, just like l told
you. Awful nice.
Johnny, do you think, l mean,
have l changed a lot?
Changed? Why she couldn't hold a
candle to you. She ain't so hot.
l just said that for the kids. No
sir.
No, thas not what r mean. What l
mean is, am l getting hard, you know.
Oh, now where did you grab onto an
idea like that? Hard?
l don't know!
l don't want to be, but well,
there's the kids and all,
and l want to do whas right for
them and may be some times l am
Now, will you stop talking like that.
Now, you're prettier than you ever
was.
l almost told that to the whole
bunch down at the party tonight.
l almost said, you ought to see my
bride
thas waiting home
for me at tonight.
And you was waiting, Katie.
That was nice, awful nice.
lt was just like it used to be.
You told about the party awful nice
tonight, Johnny.
l should have. Waited up more
often, l guess.
Aw, it ain't your fault, working
hard like you do.
You know something?
l wish l coulïve got you the rest
of that set when when we was married.
The guy said it came all the way
from Spain.
What else was in that set, Johnny?
You ain't told me in an awful long
time.
Two little side combs and a locket
on a chain.
And a bracelet you said?
Oh, there's no use talking.
Some day l'm going to look that guy
up and get you the rest of that set.
Oh, thas nice Johnny, but l don't
need...
No, there's no buts about it,
l mean it.
Things are gonna be different around
here.
You ain't gonna be working hard like
you -like you are now.
l don't mind the work, Johnny.
No, air. l ain't gonna stand for it.
Look at then pretty hands.
They ain't got no business being in
the water all the time.
l'm gonna change a lot of things
around here.
l'm gonna cut out the drinking too.
And just to prove it to you,
here's my tip money.
No, keep your tips, Johnny. Take all
a man's money, it ain't right.
And l'm gonna keep on 'em down at
the union headquarters
and make 'em get me some jobs.
Yes, six, tonighs the beginning of
something new.
Oh, you believe me, don't you,
Katie?
Yeah, Johnny, yeah, sure l do.
And l'll be singing all over
Brooklyn, and maybe Manhattan too.
Have you heard Johnny Nolan sing,
they'll say.
And then maybe some day, maybe...
Oh, Johnny, stop it! Stop it! Stop
talking!...
You ain't got a chance.
Who are we trying to kid.
Yeah, sure, you're right.
Who am l trying to kid.
l didn't want to hurt you, Johnny.
But, is the truth and l can't
change it.
Yeah. And l could tell you something
else.
All that baloney about them encores
tonight.
ls just because they was a little
drunk and feeling good.
l wasn't so much.
Thas right, l'll never be able to
change it.
Sure you're right,
who am l trying to kid?
Neeley Nolan, you stop that!
Oh, l don't want to wear no old tie!
Mama said.
All right, now, break it up! Break
it up! Run along!
Papa! Les hurry, Papa.
All right now, lad, where do you
live?
l'll take him home, he's my father.
Hey, wait, wait a minute, honey.
l expect you'd better be running
along to school, hadn't you?
l'll look after him for you.
Now, don't you worry. He ain't in
any trouble.
l'll take good care of him. Here, is
this the house?
No, next one. Second floor back.
And if you talk to him, he's always
all right.
Sure, sure, l know, now don't you
fret. You just run along. Huh?
All right, lad, come on.
We'll make it.
Alive alive oh, alive alive oh...
Oh, l didn't expect to find you here,
ma'am. ls there anything l can do?
He's my husband,
l can take care of him.
ls all right, Johnny, l'll get you
a nice cup of coffee.
A nice cup of coffee... a nice cup of
coffee.
Oh, l just wanted to say,
ma'am that the gentleman
wasn't making no trouble.
He just needed a little help.
Here, drink it Johnny.
lsn't there anything that l can do?
lf you wasn't you on the beat,
Mr. McShane,
you'd know that Johnny
never makes any trouble.
And you'd know that the whole Nolan
family doesn't need anybody's help.
l'd thank you, Mr. McShane,
if you'd mind your own business.
Oh, sure, Mrs. Nolan.
Beauty is truth through beauty that
is all ye know on earth and all
ye need to know.
Now, class,
Beauty is truth through beauty that
is all
ye know on Earth and all
ye need to know.
Now who knows the name of the meter?
...Frances Nolan?
Yes, but...
You can't know but...
l only meant to say, l was thinking
about the words, what they mean,
and l wondered...
You don't have to know the words,
Frances, just the meter.
But if beauty is truth and thas
all ye need, l mean, all you need to
know, then that means that is the
most important thing.
And if a man, i mean if somebody,
spent all his time trying to be that.
well is hard to put...
but no matter what else he did, then.
Then what, Frances?
Then it would be all right.
Wouldn't it?
l'm afraid l don't understand, a
thing you're saying, Frances.
And we're late now with our
arithmetic.
Class will get their arithmetic...
Pop, why don't the Katz and Jamma
kids talk plain English?
ls supposed to make it funny.
l guess.
Francie, you've been staring out
that window over half an hour,
can't you make up your mind
to do something?
What shall l do?
Well, you used to like to do your
homework Sundays.
Oh, l don't know. l don't like
school as much as l used to.
Now you're getting some sense.
School is the same this year as it
was last.
Mama, you know that big market on
Clancy Street, down the hill?
You can't play there, if thas what
you mean,
that neighborhooïs expensive.
Well, l meant, l mean, well the
other day l passed that
way on my way home.
And well, Mom, you know whas just
a couple blocks
away from that market?
Another market, l guess,
and am l supposed to guess whas
two blocks away from there?
Francie why don't you say what you
mean.
l didn't mean anything l guess.
Neeley, sometimes l think you make
these holes on purpose.
Papa?
Yes, baby?
You know what l read in a magazine
once?
What was it, Francie.
Well, it said that walking was a
good thing.
lt said people would look and feel a
lot better if they did more of it.
Walking put rose petals in your
cheeks, it said.
Then l ought to be a raving beauty
with all them stairs.
That isn't what it meant. lt meant,
well, like on a Sunday.
People would feel a lot better if
they got out and took a walk or
something, instead of just sitting
around.
Francie, l want you to stop talking
around about things like that.
lf you got something to say, just
say it right out. Plain.
l wasn't going to say anything.
l was just talking about walking.
Well, there's been so much talking
about walking, l think l'll take one.
You want to go along, Prima Donna?
Oh, yes, Papa. Sure, Papa.
Must be pretty special this place
you walk to thas two blocks away
from the market.
This way, Papa.
ls this it?
Yes, Papa.
The school? l don't understand.
lt must be just as nice inside,
don't you think?
The teachers and all and...
Well, what are you driving at, baby?
Bend down, Papa. l wish l could go
tot that school, Papa.
Oh, well, l don't know, baby. ld
be awful nice, but they got rules.
You gotta go to the school where you
live.
Oh, l know, l didn't really.
Oh, now, wait a minute. Maybe
there's a way.
ls a free country, ain't it?
School days, school days Hey, maybe
we could move near here.
Well, now, whoa now, whoa.
Sometime soon, as soon as our ship
comes in, Prima Donna, you'll see.
Oh, only by that time l'll
Oh, you want to go there awful bad
don't you baby?
Then we're going to find a way!
Honest?
Well, now, l gotta turn this over a
little.
Les do some more walking, maybe
is good for thinking too.
school days, school days... Hey,
that ain't a bad little house.
How'd you like to live there?
ls got a nice little porch.
l don't like yellow houses.
Well, with another coat of paint.
0h, Papa. Thas it.
Yes, sir. Thas it.
lf we only could.
Well, why can't we?
Our luck's bound to change, and the
first thing we'll do is buy this
little house when...
Some day.
Look, as long as we're gonna buy
that house some day, ah,
why don't we maybe borrow it for now,
like ah...
We'll make out is ours, then your
address would be...
98 Hibbert Avenue. Starting right
now.
Then you see? They gotta transfer
you from your old school.
How do you mean, Papa?
Yes, sir, thas it.
We can say you came here to live
with your aunt, your rich old aunt.
She's lonesome and she's gonna leave
you all her money.
Oh, Papa, could we really?
Sure we could. ls nobody's
business.
Mmm... Sometimes l forget to water
the geraniums, and, ahhhh...
you ought to hear Auntie scold me.
Ah, but you gotta put up with all
her crochets,
after all, you're her heir.
That little room up there, that
could be mine, couldn't it?
Or, ah, look Prima Donna, after all,
you know,
this ain't exactly according
to the rules.
You mean, is wrong?
No, sir, not by a jug full it ain't
wrong.
Look, the house is here, we're here
and the school's here.
Now, we wasn't all thrown together
for no reason but,
we gotta keep it kind of a secret.
You know, you can't tell nobody, and
you gotta be extra good to make up
for it.
Oh, l will. Look, there goes Auntie
now, l think.
Looks like you got an uncle too.
Now, l'm gonna show you a way to
your new school through a beautiful
little park, and l know right where
it is.
And you can see the seasons change
when you go.
Bend down, Papa. My cup runneth over.
ls dishonest, thas what it is.
You're setting the child an awful
bad example.
Papa said if it doesn't hurt anybody,
and if is not dishonest
in your heart...
You two and your fancy words.
How do you spell transfer, Francie?
T-R-A-N-S-F-E-R.
l'd rather be shot than do this
arithmetic.
lll come to you, Sonny.
And another thing, we kept Francie
out of here so she and Neeley could
be in the same class and you could
look after him.
And here, just the year when they're
getting ready to graduate,
you go and...
l tell you, is against the law and
you're making her live a lie and
l won't have you doing it.
l'm going to do this for her, Katie.
Maybe is my fault, or not, but
there ain't much l can give her.
Well, ill make an awful long walk
for your mornings.
l don't mind getting up early.
And ill be much harder on your
shoes and you won't have dresses '
like the other children.
l promise to wash down my dress
every single night.
How do you spell "appreciate".
Francie?
A-P-P...
Wait a minute.
R-E-C-l-A-T-E.
Well, if the principal swallows that
story, and l don't think he will,
l'll see what l can do about making
over that checked dress
of mine for you.
Why not, my school's over-crowded as
it is.
This is Frances Nolan, class.
l'm sure you'll all make her
welcome to our school.
Now, that will be your desk, Frances.
Run along, Sonny. l ain't gonna
spill a penny.
Well, l guess we got everything.
Neeley, our new fire escape leads
clear up onto the roof.
Whoever lives on the top floor has
got dibs on the roof.
ain't doing so well, eh, Mrs. Nolan?
Just moving near the sun. As soon as
we heard Mrs. Waters was vacating,
we made up our minds.
l've been waiting to see you, Mrs.
Nolan.
There's something l've got to ask
you, a favor l...
l'd better show you.
Hey, look at this thing.
Oh boy, we're sure to get out with a
lot less running up and down that.
We won't let anybody but us up there.
ls in here. The late Mr. Waters
gave it to me as a wedding present.
lt won't go down the stairs, and
they want fifteen dollars to move it,
lowering it out the window.
Do you mind my leaving it, Mrs.
Nolan?
lt don't take up much room and some
day when l get the fifteen dollars,
l'll send back for it.
Why, sure l don't mind, Mrs. Waters.
Can you play it?
No. Neither one of us could.
lf it ain't too much trouble, you
could dust it off once in a while,
and keep the kitchen door open a
little so it won't get cold or damp.
l sure will.
- Thank you.
And l hope it won't be long before
you can send back for it.
Have you got the curtains?
Yes, they're coming.
ls it a... ls that a...
Yeah, we kept a baby in it about 40
years ago.
Well, l was just wondering, if, if,
if you don't need it, id make a
nice handy little wash basket and
l'd be happy to give you a quarter
for it.
Why sure. My Edgar's kids is even
too old.
Excuse me for asking, Mrs. Nolan,
but it won't really make a
handy wash basket.
Please don't say nothing, l ain't
told nobody yet.
lt ain't always easy when you're
poor. But ill be a blessing to you.
Yeah, sure. Sure it will.
But there must be.
l tell you there ain't.
Good bye, Mrs. Nolan. Good bye.
Good bye, and thank you very much.
Don't forget, we're supposed to give
him a beer, or the price of one.
Well, l'm done.
l can't thank you enough, Charlie.
Always glad to do my customers a
favor, of course.
Well, we are real grateful.
lt ain't exactly as if l was in the
regular moving business.
We'll be taking ice from you, same
as usual, once a week.
Well, good bye.
Good bye, Charlie. And thanks.
He worked awful hard, Mama.
We moved up to this flat 'to save
money,
and we're not gonna start by
throwing dimes away.
No sir, there ain't a bathtub
anywhere. l looked all over.
There's the tub, young man.
Every Wednesday and Saturday, same
as always.
ls Mr. Barker.
Well, seems like the Nolans have...
have come up in the world.
Yes, we're so very, very fond of the
sunshine.
"ln Dublin's fair city, where girls
are so pretty,
Run and catch him before he goes to
the old place.
Mr. Nolan happened to be working
when we found we could make the move.
Yeah. Smaller than your old flat,
ain't it?
l'm sorry l can't ask you to sit,
Mr. Barker,
l ain't even got the coffee
on yet.
But l got my insurance money handy.
Suppose you're too busy to listen to
a bit of news, about your sister.
She, ah, she's gonna have a baby.
Please tell my sister she shouldn't
make herself such a stranger here.
l shall be very happy to render your
message. Your receipts, Mrs. Nolan.
Be sure to, now, Mr. Barker.
Good day to you, Mr. Nolan. Well,
l'm not one to spoil a family party.
l'll be on my way.
Surprise, Papa. Welcome to your new
home.
Yeah, it is kind of a surprise, all
right.
Did you move up here because it was
cheaper, or because l
We have to save where we can,
somebody's got to.
l don't mind the extra stairs.
We can still see the tree.
Pop, top floor tenant, the roof is
theirs.
And l ain't gonna let anybody up
there except Kenny Gaddis, because,
Hey, does Pop know?
Flossie Gaddis died last night.
Oh, the poor baby.
lt was nice that her Mama got her
all those pretty dresses.
Only now the poor thing will have to
lie in Potter's Field.
But, she did have the dresses.
You better show your Papa the piano.
Yeah, you better show me the piano,
Prima Donna.
The lady that was here left it.
ls got a nice tone.
ls all right.
Hey, now that we got it, maybe you
can take some lessons. Naa...
Maxwelton Braes are bonny
where early forms the dew.
And was there that Annie Lorrie gave
me a promise true.
Gave me a promise true, which ne'er
forget will be,
and for Bonny Annie Lorrie,
l would lay me down and dee.
l ain't never heard you sing that
before. ls pretty.
Maxwelton Braes are bonny, where
early forms the dew.
And was there that Annie Lorrie gave

Gave me a promise true,
which ne'er forget will be,
and for Bonny Annie Lorrie,
l would lay me down and dee.
Well, this is the beginning of a
vacation we've all looked forward to.
And l'm sure we'll enjoy our
holidays more, knowing we've helped
some unfortunate family who would
have had no Christmas dinner without
this basket.
And so a Merry...
Oh, one last thing, this extra pie,
Miss Schilling brought in.
ls little, and a bit crushed, but,
anybody want it?
My, what well fed boys and girls.
All right, class.
Miss McDonald?
Yes, Frances?
l just remembered. l know a very
unfortunate family.
They live in a, in a hovel. They
have two children.
Little golden-haired twins. And
they're all starving.
The pie will probably save their
lives.
Well, then you should take the pie
by all means.
You can come and get it when class
is dismissed.
Which is right now.
And Merry Christmas to you all.
That was a very fine Christmas
spirit, Frances.
But it seems like such a tiny pie to
save so many lives.
Oh, it won't seem small to them,
Miss McDonald.
Even a little pie can look awful big
if you haven't had much to eat
for days and days.
l'll have to tell them to eat slowly,
because they eat very fast on an
empty stomach they'll, they'll...
lt isn't true, is all a lie.
l wanted it for myself.
l'll stay after school, l'll do
anything, but don't send a note home.
l'm not going to punish you child,
for being hungry
or having an imagination.
You know, thas something very few
people have.
ls very precious.
But it can also be dangerous unless
we learn how to use it.
Our everyday lives are real and true,
but all the stories in the world,
all the music, came out of
someone's imagination.
So, if we tell the truth, and write
the lies,
then they aren't lies
anymore, they become stories.
Like some of the very nice
compositions you've written, Frances.
Like the one about
my father taking me
to see the cotton fields
down south?
We didn't really go.
l rather imagined you didn't.
But don't you think it would be
still better
if you would write about the things
you really know about
and then add to them with
your imagination.
Even stories shouldn't be
just, well, pipe dreams.
Pipe dreamers can be very lovable
people but they don't help anybody.
But they don't help anybody. Now,
think about it a little.
And have a Merry Christmas.
And enjoy your pie.
Yes, Miss McDonald.
Thank you, Miss McDonald.
For Goïs sakes. Where've you been?
You were supposed to meet me...
Neeley, l'm going to be a writer.
All right, but les eat the pie.
Come on, we gotta see about our
Christmas tree.
Oh, golly, lis still there,
isn't it?
Yeah, is still here.
He ain't got much time
left to sell it.
Go on, beat it. You know l ain't
gonna throw 'em til midnight.
What do you want to do, block the
sidewalk?
Keep customers out?
Ah, you don't own the sidewalk!
How about this one, madam?
No, that one's too big.
l want a small one.
l got just what you want,
come over here, lady.
Well, now, thas more like it.
Thas the size.
ls awful big to get thrown at you.
Why does he have to throw 'em at us,
anyway?
Why can't he can't just give 'em to
us, if he can't sell 'em?
lf he just gave 'em away,
everybody'd wait.
They'd never sell any of 'em.
lt smells good.
There she goes!
Hey, l'll do it again!
l stumbled!
Go on! Beat it! Who's next?
Come on, give me a chance, l'm next.
All right. Here she goes.
Got it, didn't l?
All right, take it. Go home. Now,
who wants to try this one?
Who's man enough for this big one
right here?
l can take anything you got,
mister. Let her fly...
l'm next! Thas my tree!
Go on, you're too small! Go home!
Me and my brother, we ain't too
small together.
Spunky huh?
All right, but if one of you drop,
you're not gonna get the tree.
There she goes!
Okay, you got it coming. Go ahead.
Oh, quit worrying about 'em, Katie,
they'll be home pretty quick!
They ain't old enough to be out this
late.
Johnny should made 'em tell what
they was up to.
No telling whas likely to happen
if Francie gets a notion in her head.
They'll be all right!
Well, l guess we'd better get on
home. We'll see them tomorrow.
No, don't go!
Hey, Pop! Hey, Mom! Hey, Mom!
Look!
Holy smoke! Will you look at what
they went and done!
They're trying to make it Christmas.
Help 'em, kid.
We got it first!
Well, sure, l was only wondering if
you couldn't use a little help, huh?
Come on, come on, come on.
Well, how would you rustle them
together...
Look at my face!
Nobody around here ever saw a tree
like that!
Well, look at my face, if you don't
believe me.
Oh, and l see you got the law on
your side.
Merry Christmas, Mr. Nolan, and it
looks like you're going to have one.
Well, the same to you, Mr. McShane,
and thanks.
Merry Christmas, Mr. Nolan.
Merry Christmas, Miss Maggie.
lsn't this a wonderful Christmas,
papa?
Oh, it is now, Prima Donna. lmagine,
us, having a tree like that.
And the nicest kids in the world.
Merry Christmas, everybody!
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas, Neeley!...
Silent night, holy night, all is
calm, all is bright...
He ain't any older than they are.
Round yon virgin, mother and child,
Holy lnfant so tender and mild,
Sleep in Heavenly peace, Sleep in
heavenly peace.
Silent night, holy night...
Here... Put it up higher, Bill!
Steve's the name.
Thas better, Bill.
Oh, les see, you know it!
Look at all the fun you can have
scratching.
Thank you, Mama.
You know you hate 'era!
They're just fine, Mama!
l got something for you too, Mama.
Johnny, it was real nice of your
friend Mr. McGarrity
to send over those candy
canes for the kids.
Yeah.
Here, l made these candle for today.
You got to light it now, is time.
Merry Christmas, Mama,
from me and Neeley.
Oh! Oh, is pretty. What is it?
Rose water and glycerine. You rub it
on your hands.
This is for you, Papa, from me and
Neeley.
My! l'll quite the thing, won't l?
l think is silly, but Francie said
Papa's always talking about
what nice hands you got.
lt cost a dime but we had a seltzer
bottle top in the junk.
Are... ah...
ls a watch fob. ls made out of
shoe laces.
l wove it on a spool with nails.
Well, if that ain't about the nicest
thing l ever did see.
Maybe is kind of silly, you not
having a watch and all...
Well, now madam, we're all out of
mushrooms under glass,
but l can tell you the time.
Thas the nicest present l ever did
get, Prima Donna.
And, ah, thank you too, son.
You're welcome. l guess the shoe
laces was mine.
lt was silly.
There ain't nothing silly on
Christmas.
l, ah... l got a little present here.
Like l was saying, l got...
Merry Christmas, Miss Francie.
Come on, we're in here.
ls Mr. McShane.
l hope l'm not intruding.
Merry Christmas, Mr. McShane.
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas. l was just ah
Hello, handsome.
Oh, Mrs. Edwards.
l was just passing and l happened to
see the light still burning.
And l was thinking l'd like
to have a hand in
decorating that fine
Christmas tree.
...l see someone's already provided.
Well, we can always use more of 'em,
Mr. McShane. Thank you kindly.
Won't you come in and have a cup of
coffee with us?
Oh, thanks, no. Ah, this evening's
for families.
And, l got to be getting home now,
so, l'll say goodbye and...
and Merry Christmas to everybody.
Thank you, Mr. McShane, good night.
That was mighty nice of him.
Mr. McShane's a fine man.
He's l think sometimes a lonely man.
Well, like l was saying, l... l got
something here.
l mean, l got a present for somebody
that ain't exactly here.
Grandma helped me pick it out. ls
for... you know who.
Oh, Bill, is beautiful.
Look everybody.
Oh, Bill, darling, l've never been
so happy.
l'm going to get some coffee.
Katie?
Yeah.
l'm glad for you.
l don't know. l'm scared, l guess.
You got no call to be. Look how
swell them two are.
Told Johnny yet? Well, maybe
you oughta, it might help him.
Yeah. You better take the coffee in.
You're a fine girl, Katie. l never
said any different.
Thas for nothing, Johnny. Except
for being a nice guy.
Coffee everybody!
Well, l guess thas about all.
Johnny, l gotta tell you something.
Maybe it ain't the right time, and
maybe it is.
The reason l moved us up here, we're
gonna have a baby, Johnny,
thas why l've been scrimping
so much and trying so hard to say.
well, thas...! . Well, l'm awful
glad, Katie, if you are.
There's a lot we've got to think
about, Johnny.
Oh, l know, but we'll make out.
Maybe things will be different.
And we'll have one to grow up with
all over again.
l got things all figured out.
l ought to be able to work until,
well anyway, April.
And then Francie'll have to leave
school
and take out her working papers.
She's young, but with what she can
make, we ought to be able to make out
Oh, but we can't do that, Katie
l don't like it any better than you
do, Johnny, but l thought
and l thought, and there
ain't no other way.
And Johnny, you got to help with
something. She listens to you.
You gotta quit getting her so all
excited about her school.
Why can't it be Neeley? He's the boy,
and he don't care like she does.
Well, maybe thas why.
Maybe ill do her good to get out
in the world and learn something,
learn how to take care of herself,
learn something practical
while she's young.
She's gotta learn some day.
Well, well, there must be another
way. Oh, l don't know.
l'll try and swing anything. l'll do
anything.
We can't count on that, Johnny...
Don't look at me like that, Johnny,
it ain't my fault!
Oh, it ain't your fault either,
l guess. l don't know.
Anyway, one member of the Nolan
family will get to graduate,
and she come close.
Thas something.
You'd better put out the light and
les get some rest.
Oh, l thought you'd be asleep, Prima
Donna.
Ah-ah. l've been thinking. l might
be going to be a writer.
l've just about decided.
l knew you when you was going to be
a lady fireman.
Don't joke, Papa. l'm serious.
All right, l baby.
All l meant was, maybe is better
not to get your heart set...
on just one thing, in case
something happens.
She said, Miss McDonald, l mean, she
said maybe l could be.
She said l have imagination.
Do you think l have, Papa?
Oh, sure you have, baby.
Those compositions of yours are sure
fine, but...
She said l'd have to work hard.
She said imagination
wasn't any good if
you were just a pipe
dreamer about it.
You didn't help anybody that way.
Not even yourself, she said.
Yeah, l see. A pipe dreamer.
l'm not putting it good like she did.
l wish you could have heard her.
She was wonderful.
For ever and ever l'll be glad you
helped me go to that school, Papa.
You kind of like that school, don't
you, baby?
Yes, oh yes. And she said lots more.
l've been trying to remember.
She said, even if you have
imagination;
is better to write about
the things you know about
so they'll be true, and...
and the way things are only.
Only what, baby?
Papa, the people in the hall when we
brought up the tree,
the look on their faces
all friendly and nice.
Why can't people be like that all
the time? Not just on Christmas?
Well, l guess is because...
Well, l don't know.
Maybe is because Christmas is like
people really
are and the other part ain't true.
And with that imagination of yours,
if you think about it hard enough,
you know, like it ought to be.
But when you get to thinking.
Papa, the people in stories, they
don't just live happily ever after,
do they?
No, baby, but...
But the trouble is...
it doesn't feel good when
you think about things like that.
l mean, like they really are.
You better stick out your tongue,
Prima Donna.
Oh, is just like l thought. You've
got a bad case.
A very bad case.
Case of what, Papa?
A very bad case of growing up.
Thas all it is.
Oh it ain't fun some times, but,
don't you be afraid.
l don't want you should ever be
afraid.
You're so nice, Papa.
l guess is better if you don't
just stay young all your life.
lll be much nicer growing up.
Yeah. And you get to see things
like they really are.
Good night, baby.
Good night, Papa. l'm sleepy now.
Thas fine, baby. Just fine.
Ain't you coming to bed, Johnny?
No, l'm going to take a little walk.
Don't start drinking,
not tonight, Johnny.
l won't, Katie, l won't.
Well, did he go out on a job,
do you know?
lf he did, he didn't get it through
us.
Thank you.
Oh, how are you, Mrs. Nolan,
and a Happy New Year to you.
Same to you, Mr. McGarrity.
l just came to.
well, l happened to be passing by
and l thought l'd run in and thank
you for the candy canes you sent us.
lt was nice of you.
Oh, thas all right. lt wasn't much.
Well, it was nice of you. Good night,
Mr. McGarrity.
Good night, Mrs. Nolan. Mrs. Nolan,
Johnny ain't here.
He ain't been here since before
Christmas.
Oh, l'm afraid is bad news l'm
bringing you, Mrs. Nolan.
Our station just got a report that
Mr. Nolan was found
over in Manhattan, very sick.
He's been taken to a hospital.
See that Neeley gets to school on
time in the morning.
There's an apple for your lunches.
The report says that he just
collapsed,
right in the doorway of
an employment agency.
And he'd just been going out on a
job, as sand hog in a tunnel, they said.
And he hadn't been drinking, ma'am.
He'd been waiting there a long time
for the job.
He was just sick.
We did everything we could.
Yeah, sure, l know.
What are you writing down that he
died from, Doctor?
Acute alcoholism and pneumonia.
One led to the other.
l don't want you to write down that
he died like that.
Put just the pneumonia.
l can't do that.
Pneumonia was the direct cause of
death, but the alcoholism was...
Look, he's dead.
l've got two nice kids that are going
to grow up to amount to something.
Why do you have to make it hard by
saying that their father
died from the drink when thas
only a little piece of the truth?
He wasn't drinking, they said so.
He was out looking for work.
Why can't you put that down?
Cause of death: pneumonia.
Everlasting rest and happiness,
through the infinite merits
of Jesus Christ.
Oh, God,
great and omnipotent judge of the
living and the dead,
if all whom we are to appear
after this short life,
to render an account of our worth,
let our hearts we pray to be deeply
wounded at the sight of this death,
and while we consign the body of the
deceased to the earth,
let us be mindful of our own frailties
and mortality,
that walking always in thy fear and
in the ways of thy commandments,
we may after our departure from this world,
experience
a merciful judgement and rejoice
in everlasting happiness.
Through Christ our lord.
All them people, and the flowers.
Some of them from people l never
heard of even.
Who'd have thought, that many folks.
l mean they was carrying on like
they was his family, or...
or... l don't know.
Yeah, he took the time to make a lot
of people love him all right.
ls hard to figure out so many of
them showing up.
And they was feeling something.
l mean, there was no reason for them
to put on.
He was nobody big, he was just a...
Katie, don't talk about it no more,
kid.
Francis!
Les leave her be, Katie. She
maybe wants to be by herself.
She's taking on kind of funny, she
ain't even cried.
l'd like my father's shaving cup.
That one, "Nolan".
Oh, you're the little girl. Yes,
l'll clean it up for you.
He was a fine man.
Tell your Mama that l,
his barber, said this.
Francis...
What?
Francis, do you know where you're
going?
No place.
Francis?
Yes, Mama?
lt was nice of the neighbors to send
over all that food,
don't you want something?
No, Mama.
l wanted to talk to you, Francie.
l want things to go on,
reading and all. l want to do...
Well, l gotta be Mama and Papa both
to you now, Francie.
Yes, Mama. ls that all, Mama?
Well, you gotta go right now,
Francie.
l'll be back. Honest l will.
Mom, l guess l'm a little hungry.
Look, he can't be dead. He can't.
They don't understand.
Maybe you could let me have a baby
some day, and it could be a boy,
so it could be just like him.
ld have to be me.
Nobody else loved him like l do.
Maybe you could do that for me. And
if you could, he wouldn't even die.
l hope you don't think l'm forward
coming in like this, Mrs. Nolan.
How are you, Francie?
l'm well, thank you.
Have a chair. Francie, see if Mr.
McGarrity won't have some coffee.
Not for me, thank you.
l figured l'd ought to come.
l suppose you know how Johnny
and l done business.
He used to give me money to keep
and then draw against it.
l got to looking around.
And... what do you think?
l had pretty near 5 bucks
in his box.
Ando so l figured
it belongs to you.
ld more likely be
that he owed you.
But thank you very much.
l just thought...
- We'll make out.
There's something else, then.
Maybe you wouldn't mind if...
if Francie and Neeley
come down and work for me,
afternoons like. l mean,
after school and Saturdays.
Maybe it isn't just the place
you'd favour them working,
but l'd keep an eye on them.
And l could pay them
2 dollars a week a piece.
l'd take it
as a real favour, Madame.
You're an awful bad liar.
But you're a very good man.
l'm ashamed l didn't know before.
No, it isn't that, Madame.
Johnny was...
Well, l don't know. Johnny...
Johnny always talked
about his family like...
like folks ought to,
only they don't.
And whenever he talked about it
he always made you
feel better,
or you wanted to laugh.
laugh. Like that sea shell l had
there.
He was always... he was always
listening to it and...
and telling you what it was saying.
He was always giving things like
that to people.
He was a fine man, Mrs. Nolan.
l'd a glad to let the children work
for you, Mr. McCarrity.
And the four dollars a week will
keep us until the baby comes.
And Francie won't have to quit
school, she can keep on,
and they can both...
Well, is a deal, then.
And you tell them to come through
the family entrance tomorrow after
school and ah...
ls that all right with you, Francie?
Yes.
Well, ah, well is settled then,
and good day to you, Mrs. Nolan.
And thank you again, Mr. McGarrity.
Francie?
Yes, Mama?
l'm glad you can keep on with your
school.
l was hoping something like this
would happen but l didn't want to
say anything until the time come.
But your Papa and l talked it all
over and there were reasons
and there just wasn't any other way.
lt doesn't matter. Papa saved one
from it.
Hi-ya, kid.
Well, they're sure taking chances l
wouldn't, leaving you handling meat.
Where's France.
Hello, kid. How are you lamb? Look,
you gotta do something for me.
This was in the paper and l cut it
out.
You got to read it to me.
Whas the matter, hon?
Nothing, l'm all right, Aunt Sissy.
No, you ain't. You ain't been since...
Look, don't you think you better
spill it to your Aunt Sissy?
What is it you want me to read to
you, Aunt Sissy?
Well, we'll get that out of the way
first. Look, here it is.
Likely you don't remember him, but
is my last husband, Bill.
The one l thought was dead,
but he ain't.
He's got his picture in there and l
want to know what it says.
Maybe it says where he lives so's l
can write to him about getting a
divorce or something.
l got the best husband in all the
world now,
and l don't want this here one
bobbing up and making no trouble.
He's a fireman someplace. l can tell
that from his clothes.
He was just starting out in the
fireman business...
lt says he's a hero. He saved some
people in a fire.
Does it say where?
The ninth precinct. Manhattan.
Manhattan, huh? Couldn't make the
grade in Brooklyn, l guess.
l want you to write to him, Francie.
Write this: "Dear Bill...
This says his name is Roland Polasky.
Thas right. l remember. Make it
"Dear Mr. Polasky.
Being's as now l'm married to
somebody else, l want you to see
about getting a real legal divorce.
Because l thought you was dead but
you ain't.
And because you got the money now on
account of the reward.
Yours very truly, Sissy." Something
like that.
But Aunt Sissy, he must have already
done that.
Because it says here he's married
again.
lt does?
"On the human interest side of the
story,
Mrs. Polasky had returned home only
the day before from the hospital,
after presenting Mr. Polasky with
a brand new son,
the fourth child of the marriage.
So, if he got a divorce that long
ago, you don't have to.
Then my being married to Bill, this
one l mean, is all legal?
Well, now, if that ain't a load off
my chest.
You know something, l think l'll
give Bill Polasky a wedding present.
But Aunt Sissy, you can't. He's been
married for years.
Four kids, huh? Must be a sickly
woman, this Mrs. Polasky,
going to the hospital just
to have a baby.
Oh, no, lots of people go there now
to have babies. ls better.
Sure enough? You know something?
l'm gonna cash in my funeral policy
and have my baby at a hospital.
And when my baby is born, and lives,
l want you to write that R. Polasky
and announce it.
Boy do l feel better.
And now, chickapea, we'll talk about
you.
Can't your Aunt Sissy help you any?
l'm all right.
No, you aren't honey.
Not all shut up like that, l know
how you feel,
but you can't keep hanging on to it.
l'm ail right. l don't want to talk
about it.
All right, baby. All right. But l'll
tell you what.
You can do something for me.
Look, your Mama feels awful bad too.
She needs you.
Why don't you talk to her about it.
She doesn't need me.
No she doesn't.
She's got Neeley!
Why wasn't it Neeley she was going
to make quit school.
He never cared about it.
She doesn't love me like Papa did.
And she didn't love him, either. Not
really.
She hurt him, l saw her. And he
never hurt anybody.
l'm gonna finish this grade because
he gave it to me
and then l'll work for her.
But she can't be Papa to me, she
can't ever!
Don't feel like that, baby, don't.
Leave me alone. l'm all right.
Please go away and leave me alone.
All right, chickapea, all right.
Ah, Mr. Sterns...
Yes, sir.
Francie...
Yes, Mama?
l want to talk to you, Francie.
Yes, Mama?
lt isn't going to be long now, for
me, l mean, for my baby.
We can't come to a hospital.
There isn't even going to be enough
money for a woman to come and help.
l'm going to need you, Francie.
Don't ever be far away.
Neeley's, well, a boy ain't much
good at a time like this.
l'm counting on you, Francie.
You won't forget that, will you?
All right, Mama. l'll remember.
Which one of you is Mr. Steven
Edwards?
Thas me.
Well, there are three in your family
now.
You are the father of a pretty fine
boy.
ls he alive?
- Very much so.
He was a little reluctant about it
at first, l had to rouse him with a
little oxygen, now he's mad at me,
you ought to hear him.
l've got to see him.
Well, neither one of them are quite
up to a visit just now,
in a little while.
The learning. The learning that
saved that baby.
Thas fine, Bill.
Where are you going, Uncle Bill?
l'm going out and get some
strawberry ice cream
and a rattle for my son.
And whas more, my name ain't Bill.
ls Steve, do you hear that? l'm a
Papa and my name's Steve.
And is Uncle Steve, too. Steve,
Steve...
So, we have a man in the family.
Quick as we see she's all right,
you go on up to McGarrity's and
see if you can do my work, too.
l'm going to finish the scrubbing
for her.
She oughtn't do any more.
She wasn't feeling good this morning.
Mama!
Mama!
ln here, Frances.
You all right, Mama?
Give Neeley a nickel to go after
Grandma and Sissy.
He can walk home after.
Get me a nightgown in that bottom
drawer.
Hurry, don't stand there staring.
ls she going to die?
Of course not, is the baby. You
heard what Mama said, and hurry.
And don't forget stopping at
McGarrity's on the way back.
We can't lose the work. She only
wants me now. Mama!
What is it?
Oh, l'll be there in a minute.
You're taking real good care of me,
Francie.
Am l, Mama?
Umm. Tastes good.
Can l get you a glass of water,
Mama?
When l want something,
l'll ask for it.
Yes, Mama.
Don't just stand there and throw
questions at me, l'm too tired.
You'd better have some coffee too.
Mama, even if Neeley is a boy,
wouldn't you rather have him here?
He's always such a comfort to you.
No, is you thas a comfort now.
What time is it?
l don't know, Mama.
Get the clock.
one minute to Mama.
Are you sure it isn't slow?
No, Mama.
Maybe is fast, then.
l'll look at the jeweler's clock out
the parlor window.
That candle's pretty, like Christmas.
That was the night l told him.
ls nice having a visit from my
daughter.
l didn't want for you to have to
grow up so soon.
l didn't want for you to have to
quit school.
l tried to tell him that.
He didn't mind about the baby, but
he never forgived me
for wanting you to quit school.
l told him and he just went out. You
never forgived me, either.
Please don't, Mama.
He would have bought you dolls
instead of milk.
l don't know, maybe you would have
been happier. l don't know.
l never woulïve thought of giving
you that school, like he did.
And all them fine compositions of
yours. l never read one of 'em.
l shoulda had time. Johnny did.
But l couldn't do no different.
l don't know how l could do any
different.
What time is it?
One minute after four, Mama.
Rinse a cloth out in cold water,
wipe my face.
Don't let her die, please!
Mama, what if the baby comes before
Grandma and Aunt Sissy get here?
You can see l couldn't do no
different, can't you?
Neeley, he don't like school.
lf he'd quit, he'd never go back
again.
But you, no matter what happens,
you'd find a way to go back,
you'd fight to go back.
You can see that, can't you?
l... Yes, Mama.
Read me something, Francie.
- Yes, Mama.
Read me one of your compositions.
l ain't never read any of your
compositions.
ls on my conscience.
l tore all those up.
No, you didn't. Not all of'em.
Can't l read you Shakespeare? ls
much better.
Read "Twas on a Night Like This".
l'd like to have something pretty on
my mind. Sit by the candle.
"The moon shines bright,
in such a night as this,
when the sweet wind did
gently kiss the trees..."
Say, did you ever find out who
Troylis was and Cressida?
Yes, Mama, Troylis was...
Some other day when l got time. Read
me one of your compositions now.
You won't like them, Mama.
You thought about them, and you
worked on them,
and you got good marks on them.
Get 'em, l said.
Sit here. Go on.
ls called, "The Man People Loved".
Please don't make me do this, Mama.
Read it.
"Perhaps many people might have said
of him that he was a failure.
lt is true that he had no gift for
making money,
but he had a gift for laughter,
and for making people love him.
He had the gift of making you feel
proud to walk down the street with him
He had nothing to give but himself.
But of this he gave generously, like
a king.
Like a king. Thas like it was.
Walking down the street with him,
you always felt like that.
Did you, Mama.
You were real smart to write it down
like that, Francie.
Thas like it was. Francie, l miss
him so much!
lf the baby's a boy, we'll call him
Johnny. Where's Sissy?
Neeley's been gone a long time. Wipe
my face.
No, don't let go of my hand.
lf is a girl, we'll call her Annie
Lorrie.
Remember that tune he played? You
ought to have piano lessons.
l'll see if l can manage.
You won't forget to dust the piano,
will you Francie?
Who'll cry for me like that if l
died?
l never did a wrong thing in my life,
but it ain't enough.
Oh! Sissy, l didn't mean to be hard,
like you said!
lf Johnny were here, he could go to
your graduation, and l'd go to
Neeley's, but l, l can't tear myself
into two pieces.
How am l going to do both? Oh!
Where are you, Francie!
l'm here, Mama!
Oh, you're such a comfort to me.
l'm so tired. Leave me sleep now.
You'd better start some water
boiling,
she's going to be needing it.
We'll call you if there's anything
we need.
l thought you were never coming,
Sissy.
Come on, you quit worrying, now.
The baby is here and the Mama is
doing good. She's asleep.
A small baby sister it is.
Annie Lorrie. Papa would have liked
that.
Where's Grandma?
l've got her in a front seat so she
won't miss a thing.
lsn't your classroom around here
somewhere?
Yes, but...
How about giving me a peek?
Wouldn't hurt me none seeing a
little more places like that.
Hey, Francie, you forgot your
flowers.
They aren't mine, l'm not carrying
flowers today.
Some of the girls, their family
sends them flowers.
They're on your desk, lamb. Better
go see.
Oh well, l have to get my things,
anyway.
"To Francie on graduation day, love
from Papa."
He gave me the money to buy them way
before Christmas.
To make sure he had it, he said.
Then he wrote out the card.
Come on, Kid.
Let it go, baby, there ain't a soul
around here. Let it go.
Frances Nolan.
Well, sir, l don't think Grandma
said one word the whole time.
And from the looks of her when l put
her on the street car, she'll
probably ride clear out to Coney
lsland and never know the difference.
Heaven knows what she would have
been like
if she'd got to both graduations.
Looks to me like it was a pretty
fine day. How's your soda, Francie?
Pineapple's not as good as chocolate.
Then whad you order it for?
Because l'm up to the "Ps". Next
time l'll try raspberry next.
There's something to that idea. Try
everything once.
Sissy!
And a dime for you, my boy. This is
a special occasion. Thank you.
He don't know how special it is.
Two diplomas in the Nolan family all
in one day.
Mama, l've got a nickel if you want
to leave it. People do.
ls going to be all right, Francie.
And you know something, these ain't
gonna be the last diplomas, either.
l don't know how we're gonna work it,
but we're gonna find
some way for you and...
Hi, Neeley, how ya doing?
Okay, l got out of jail.
Say, wasn't that you l saw working
behind that bat the other day?
Well, yeah, but...
Hey, you were pretty good.
You know what?
l can come out and give you some
pointers some time.
Honest?
Sure l will. That is, if your mom
don't mind.
Naw, she don't mind. You mean it?
Sure. Well, l'll see you on the lot.
Maybe you better ask your ma, you
know,
l don't want to do anything
she wouldn't want me to.
Naw, she won't care.
Maybe you'd better ask her yourself,
just to make sure.
l'm Neeley's aunt, this is his ma,
but thas his sister.
Whas-your name, big boy?
Hershel Knudsen.
Mr. Knudsen, l'd like for you to
meet my niece, Miss Francie Nolan.
Pleased to meet you.
Hello.
Nice night if it don't rain. Sit
down, Hershel.
Ah, doing anything tomorrow
afternoon, Miss Nolan?
ls Saturday.
l don't know. Why?
Well, there's a swell picture. "Pill
Hard". Maybe you'd like to go.
Who with?
Me.
Oh. Well, l might be busy. l'll let
you know.
Well, l'll come around and see.
Hey, l thought we was going to play
ball tomorrow.
Well, we can do that anytime. Sure,
there's lots of time.
Ah, come on, Hersh.
Well, l'll be seeing you, Miss Nolan.
Hey, mushy!
l'm proud of you, chickapea. You
handled him just fine.
lt was the hair that done it.
Well, l hate to bust this party up,
but them babies gotta be fed.
Steve'll be needing a little
something too.
Three hours with the both of them.
Thirty out of fifty.
Keep the change.
Thank you.
Why, Katie Nolan.
l don't care.
There's times when feeling good and
things like that is important.
l don't care.
will you carry my flowers for me,
Mama?
Ah, ya missed it, Steve.
Ah, hello, handsome.
Ah, l'm begging your pardon, Mrs.
Nolan. l just happened to drop in.
And your brother in law here seemed
to be needing a little help.
And the baby didn't seem to mind, so
l hope l'm not intruding.
Well, not at all, Mr. McShane.
You sit right down. We're going home.
Come along, Steve.
l'll take her, Mr. McShane.
Oh, l'd like it if you'd leave her.
Her and me has got to be good
friends.
Well, l wish you didn't have to
hurry.
Gotta get this family of mine home.
Steve's got to deliver milk to a lot
of those babies
that like that bottled kind.
...Hmm. You don't want frown like
that, Kate.
The fellas don't like that at all.
Good bye, kids. So long, Mac.
Oh, so long, Mrs. Edwards.
Thank you, Aunt Sissy.
Bye, Mac.
Mr. Edwards, good bye.
Well... Well, l will take the
baby from you, Mr. McShane.
Mrs. Nolan, likely you've been
wondering why l came here tonight.
Well, let your wondering be over
because
l came here on a personal matter.
Mama, should l go...
No, no. Don't be leaving, children.
My conversation will be concerning
you as well as your mother.
Mrs. Nolan, l feel
that there's no disrespect in
my speaking my mind at this time.
And l feel that a decent time has
elapsed since the passing of
Mrs. McShane, God rest her soul.
Oh, l didn't know, Mr. McShane,
l'm sorry.
Well, l said nothing, Mrs. Nolan,
because it was near the time
of your own bereavement.
And l didn't wish to...
Well, l know that is barely six
months since your own husband too,
left this world, rest his soul.
But, when you feel, a decent
interval has elapsed,
l'm asking to keep company with you,
Catherine Nolan,
with the object of a wedding,
when a decent time has elapsed.
And for my part, l'll be glad to
keep company with you, Mr. McShane,
not for the help you can give us,
because
we know we can manage some way,
but,
because you're a good man,
Mr. McShane.
Ah, and there's ah, there's one more
thing. Their father was a fine man.
And l'd have no wish to be trying
take his place.
lt would be more my intention to be
like a real good friend.
As the eldest, would you be
approving?
Yes, Mr. McShane.
l was thinking, it wouldn't be right
for me to ask the two eldest to
take my name.
But the little one, the one who has
never looked on her father.
Could you be thinking of letting me
legally adopt her?
lf that time comes. The child shall
have your name.
And now l'm wondering if
l could smoke my pipe.
You could have smoked any time,
Mr. McShane.
l didn't want to take any privileges
before l was entitled to them.
Help me put her to bed, Neeley.
- Why?
Fix the blankets.
l'll be heating up the coffee now.
will you join me in a cup,
Mr. McShane?
Oh, thank you, Catherine, l will.
Annie Lorrie McShane.
Yeah.
She'll never have the hard times we
had, will she?
She'll never have the fun, either.
We did have fun, when we were young,
didn't we?
Yeah.
Remember the olden days when we
collected junk?
Poor Lorrie.
Neeley, look at the tree, is
growing again, just like Papa said.
l feel kind of sad, like we're
saying good bye to something.
Yeah.
Neeley, am l good looking?
oh, whas eating you?
No, honest, Neeley. l want to know.
You'll pass.
You're sweet, Neeley.
Oh, cut the mush.
