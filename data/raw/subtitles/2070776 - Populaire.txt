The key to being a good
secretary is discretion.
You must be indispensible,
but without being pushy.
An employer must see you're
capable, right off the bat.
Wearing glasses is essential.
- But I don't have vision problems.
- So ?
Neither do I.
I wear non-prescription.
Glasses give the appearence of being
at once serious and unobtrusive.
As for the rest, you've got it all.
Natural make up,
a sober coiffure that stays in place,
moderate use of perfume.
A mild soap is also very good
if you don't have perfume.
- It's all in your bearing.
- And your forbearance!
So, what's he like?
Really not bad.
What's your name again, my dear?
Rose Pamphyle, with a "Y".
I'm from Saint-Fraimbault.
What brings you here,
Rose Pamphyle-with-a-"Y"?
Saint-Fraimbault is not next door.
So far I've worked for 
my father, in his drug store.
- It's the number one store in the village.
- It's important to be number one.
I've done enough time in sales.
Opportunities are are back home.
Specially if you want to be a secretary.
All the girls want to be secretaries.
It's the latest fad.
To be a secretary, 
is to be modern.
To meet lots of people, tour the world,
and work for great men.
If you worked for me you
would only get to tour Lisieux.
Pretty good for starters.
Reality is much less chic
than what the papers say.
Not all bosses have incredible adventures
and neither do their secretaries.
- You may as well go back home.
- I need this job Mr. Echard.
The only thing I can do well is type.
Typing is the minimum
requirement for a secretary.
It's not against the law
to use ten fingers.
So?
How did it go?
The looked at me like I was dressed
for a costume ball, Francoise.
I bet you were the prettiest one.
They took me on!
They hired me!
Just for one week. To try me out.
Secretary!
Do you realize what this...?!
- When do you start?
- Tomorrow.
Tomorrow we make your
 engagement official.
Help me label this stuff before you leave.
Sure, Mr. Jean.
I won't marry Maurice, papa.
The best catch in town,
and she's having none of it.
Maurice can make her happy,
I just don't get it.
Well, it's just to tell you
 the estimate is done ...
the estimate and...
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Mr Echard,
I don't know if I should ask this,
but do you think you could
 avoid smoking at work?
There'd have to be a law
forbidding me, my dear.
This machine was made for a woman
not for an elefant.
I was saying,
I've already done the estimate
We have to face the obvious,
Bob, we have a problem.
You French see problems everywhere.
Make everything climb to the sky.
We didn' rebuild half the city
after the war to eventually
replace it with New York.
- People need their landmarks.
- The sky's my limit.
Your wheels are bigger than
your office. When are you
going to move out of there?
You don't think I'll leave you
in peace so easily, Echard.
My Buick and you,
are all I need to be happy.
I'll meet you there,
Rose is running late.
Ah, your new recruit?
- Listen.
- What is she like?
- She's only been here 3 days.
- Oh, yeah.
Her ...?
I'm sure you didn't hire her
for her professional qualities.
# Joyeux anniversaire #
# Joyeux anniversaire #
# Happy birthday to you, Louis #
# Happy birthday to you #
Every year we have a surprise
 party, and what's worse is,
 every year you're surprised.
- Bravo!
- Joe, Simone, come here!
Bravo, you were perfect.
What about me, don't I get
encouragement from the jury?
You already know Marie, 
you're perfect. I've been telling
you since primary school!
Wait!
Make a wish.
I already have all I need.
Papa, tell us again
how you and mama met.
You know that story by heart.
When I came from America
to liberate France...
You, and thousands of other soldiers.
First, the Marines took
 the Normandy beaches.
- Which they couldn't do
 without our help.
- Anyway...
I had to land behind enemy lines.
But, the barn he crashed into was your...?
- Grampa's!
Perhaps, but it was me...
who married your mother.
She was the prettiest girl around.
And still is.
Echard and Sons Agency!
Absolutely, Sir.
Mr. Echard sees clients
in the mornings.
Thursday, 10 o'clock?
Yes. You are Mr...?
...Constant.
Certainly.
Of course.
Mr. Constant Thursday, 10:.
Certainly!
I've made a note.
Good day, Mr Constant.
It's not a "D", but a "T" on the end.
I don't know if that's legible.
Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Blaiseau!
May I present Miss Pamphyle,
my new secretary.
- Miss.
- If you'll follow me.
It won't be necessary,
we won't be long.
No problem with your account,
 I hope.
No, you must accept this.
1949! No, I couldn't.
Don't be a meathead, I've known
you since you were this high.
A lady as young as yourself
could not have known me
when I was that high.
Shall I see you out?
Cigarette?
Rose...
I've watched you for a week now.
I'm not too sure you're happy here.
I bought a stenography manual
yesterday, Mr Echard.
- Forget it, it's a no go.
- I'll get the hang of it. You'll see...
You'll be wasting your time.
Not at all!
I've mastered
telephone technique... sort of.
I just doubt that your
future is here with me.
Unless...
you agree to do a little something.
Anything you want.
It's been on my mind
since I first saw you.
It doesn't concern work
 strictly speaking,
but I'm sure it'll
make you happy, my dear.
And me too.
Rose!
You misunderstood me!
It's YOU who misunderstood ME,
if you think it's so easy
 to get me in bed.
Mrs. Darnien...
You're crackers !
I'd have to be an idiot
to make advances to you !
You think you're so clever
 in your fancy clothes?
You leave me cold, Mr. Echard.
- The feeling's mutual.
- Suits me !
Here's where I want you,
 not in my bed.
REGIONAL 
SPEED TYPING CHAMPIONSHIP
Is this really all you want
 me to do, to keep my job?
Participate in a contest?
Not participate...
win.
I thought this was
 a friendly match.
No such thing as FRIENDLY,
to a real athlete, Taylor.
Athlete? Where?
I see an insurance salesman.
You see, before you, the trainer
of the next Champion of Lower Normady
in Speed Typing.
Echard, when you hire a secretary,
you get to know her, and you marry her.
You don't enter her in contests
With no training and
already she goes like bazes.
- I can't pass up such a gift.
- Sleep with her.
It'll do her more good
than a medal.
A trainer doesn't sleep
with his athlete, Taylor.
It guarantees under-performance.
She isn't cut out for
high level competition.
Wanna bet?
Alright, you're on.
I'll beat you this time.
Rose is a little animal --
wild and skittish.
All she needs to burst forth
is someone to take care of her.
Kindness will be 
your undoing, Echard.
In round one she'll have to
type at least 360 strokes a minute.
The whole competition takes
as much effort as running 5Km.
Punching keys, 
I could do that too !
- Oh, yeah? 
Go tell the jury.
- Jury?
Every mis-stroke counts,
whether inverted or omitted.
For every extra word...
every line spacing error,
they deduct 100 strokes.
Only 16 qualify in 10 minute rounds,
then 8, then 4...
The last two face off
for 5 minutes.
I'd like to see YOU do that !
- They're sensational!
- "They're sensational!"
Go, Paulette,
type faster than your shadow!
Pau-lette Marti-no! 
Queen of the steno!
The national title's up for grabs
after the regional.
What's the world record?
- 512 strokes a minute.
- 512 strokes a minute.
- Held by an American.
- Why didn't you say so!
She's lousy at everything, but
when she types, she's fast,
powerful, focused. You'll see.
Ladies, please,
May I have your attention.
Everybody in position.
Attention! Hands above your keyboards.
358 strokes! Two goddamn characters,
and we'd have qualified.
If you typed with 10 fingers like them,
it could have been possible.
Don't worry !
This is not a sport for clumsy girls.
Stop. Stop, please.
I'll continue on foot.
You should have got angry at
the typewriter. Now, it's too late.
I could have opened it by myself.
I may be clumsy, but I'm not infirm!
Never enter her in a
sharpshooting contest.
We'd all end up dead.
You always reek of tobacco,
Miss Pamphyle.
No doubt, you feel you're above
the rules of our establishment?
This is a boarding house
for serious young ladies!
Decidedly... 
I've upset you, my dear.
Stop calling me "my dear", 
I have a name like everybody.
One set-back isn't necessarily
a bad thing.
For you.
Tomorrow you'll find another
racehorse for a pastime.
I'll go back to
Saint-Hicksville-on-the-Sea,
and marry the son 
of a gas station attendant.
The whole village will laugh at me
for being unable to keep a job for a week.
I've always been a laughing stock.
No one's forcing you to go
back to Saint-Hicksville-on-the...
...Saint-Fraimbault.
I might have that choice
if I were a man.
I'm not good at anything.
Maybe you're only good at typing.
Being good at one thing,
in this world, is enough.
Enough to look like a dope.
I'd like you to participate
in the next competition.
I'd like YOU to leave me alone.
I'll train you.
I'll take care of everything.
I'll put you up at my house.
- With you?
- Yeah.
It would be...
more...
practical.
And...
You...
You'd hire me for good if I accept.
You were a horrible secretary.
Your office work will be like extra training.
You'll open in the mornings and I'll close up.
You'll go to work by bicycle.
I'll come by car a little later,
same thing at the end of the day.
People mustn't know you live with me.
They'll gossip
Come on.
Come on.
Holy cow !
It's like being in "Gone With the Wind"!
My father had this built.
Odd that you have the same
 tastes as your father.
No time to fix it up to suit
 my style, that's all.
We'll train here every
evening and week-ends.
I don't expect you to lug it to work
every morning. I'll buy another.
However...
it wouldn't hurt
to work on your biceps.
Come, I'll show you your room.
Never mind those old trinkets.
You must have been some athlete !
I didn't have the stuff
of champions.
Perhaps.
But you were sporty.
If you need me,
my room's upstairs,
at the end of the hall.
Don't worry I won't jump you.
It's a very old house,
270
the stairs creak at every step,
you'd hear me coming
from miles away.
I want you to type one book
a month until the competition,
twelve in all.
"Literary Dactylography",
will help you to grasp
difficult constructions,
and precise styles,
you'll be able to anticipate
the ends of phrases
from any text, in no time.
No need to understand everything.
It's very simple.
Each finger corresponds to one colour;
and each colour to a group of letters.
Left middle finger, colored yellow,
types the apostrophe, and letters E, D, C.
Right ring finger, colored red,
types O, L, and the colon.
I can read !
I can understand everything.
Even complicated phrases.
You'll grasp them more easily
if you fan them out, Rose.
Don't forget to double them up.
You can pull them from the roller
faster, without tearing.
No need to watch over me,
I'm a big girl.
There are buses leaving for
Saint-Fraimbault every day.
Mister Echard?
Yes, my dear?
I've destroyed 
Mrs. Maurelle's policy...
and I think I killed the shredder.
Handle it yourself,
you're a big girl.
Shit !
You alright?
Yes, I think so.
Does this hurt?
If I press here,
feel anything? If I press there...
Why not insure my fingers,
while you're at it?
Come on, I'll take you.
If Flaubert took as long as you
to write "Madame Bovary"
he'd have died before she did.
Do you think demoralizing me
will get you better results?
You're still too touchy
to win anything.
The story behind this bottle involves
a painter and an old farmer.
In 1950, I was estimating
storm damage at a little farm.
You want me to practise or not?
The farm was in a bad state.
A tree had fallen
right on the chicken coop,
and made a big hole in the roof.
Mr Echard, I can't type
 if you speak to me.
You must be able to
 remain focused
no matter what is going on
around you.
To plug the hole,
Picard, the farmer...
had used an old painting.
I removed it,
dried it,
and guess what I uncovered?
A Van Gogh!
When I showed the painting to Picard,
he said he got it from his grandmother,
that he'd never heard of this Mr Van Gogh,
and all he was interested in was,
if the insurance would cover the damage.
I convinced Picard to 
put the painting up for auction,
now he's as rich as Croesus,
and has furnished my cellar
with this eccellent cru from 1934.
Your clients always 
offer you wine, it seems.
It's a miracle you're not an alcoholic.
Nobody said the training was finished.
No disrespect, Mr Echard,
 but you're stupid.
I know.
I should have kept the painting.
You're stupid to play the tough guy with me,
since you're the kindest person I know.
You don't know many people.
Latest fashion in Paris.
- Ah!
Au revoir.
Time's up!
Next!
Mademoiselle?
If you're looking for the matching panties,
- lI'm wearing them.
- No, it's not at all...
Rose, you left this in the machine and...
Keep it, if you like it so much.
Thanks, but I have a whole collection.
Add that to your collection.
Now I understand why
I can't find any files
since you've been working for me.
I was just in the middle of
 rearranging.
I'd be finished
if I didn't have to spend
all my evenings
with "Madame Bovary".
Who do you think is the most beautiful?
They're stars...
They wouldn't be interested
in an insurance man.
Just pretend.
I'm sure you like curvaceous women,
like everybody.
The others must seem too
classic, too dated.
My type is more like, that one.
What film's she been in?
Nothing, it's my mother.
She's very beautiful.
I know I don't resemble her at all.
I took after my father.
If he weren't so narrow-minded,
we'd be the best friends in the world.
Men and women are very
different creatures, that's all!
Rose!
Rose?
I can't do it!
My fingers hurt!
My back hurts
I ache everywhere...
Are you completely mad?
You gave me a fright!
A man who cooks!
Now that's modern!
Type.
New paragraph.
If you sit up straight,
you won't ache anymore.
Not supple enough,
that's your problem...
Not at all, I'm very supple.
- Extremely supple, even!
- Oh yeah?
Yellow, then red, then green...
You think I'm really going to
 give her piano lessons?
I've already got plenty to do,
between the children and the house!
It'd just be for a few months...
Let's go!
Stay and eat,
Bob won't be long.
Rose needs to practise.
It's been a pleasure to meet you.
Kids, do you want to see
a magic trick?
Yeah Louis!
Yes, please Louis!
Keep your eye on the knife!
Louis don't!
Stop it!
I'll stop only...
if you promise to give her lessons!
It's no big deal if I don't learn
to play the piano Mr Echard!
Stop it, you'll cut off a finger!
Promise!
You traumatized
those poor kids
You could 'thank' me.
For doubling my hours of training
with piano lessons?
Thanks a lot!
Anyway, Mrs. Taylor is very beautiful.
Is she your mistress?
Rose, she's my best friend's wife!
You've known her longer than him!
Yes, you're right.
Marie and me, we had a liaison.
When we were five!
You looked at her like she
was your mistress.
Bind it tighter 
and stop spouting nonsesnse!
I don't want to hurt you.
Alright by me.
It seems you're a man...
who knows what it really means to suffer?
You've been to war, after all.
I may have suffered,
but not as much as others.
Not as much as who?
Aren't you fed up
asking me questions?
Not a chance, considering
the length of your answers!
You want me to trust you but
you're unable to do the same.
In '43 I led a small
Resistance group,
Incredibile guys!
I'd known them since always.
Barthelemy, Piero and Roger,
the Blaiseau boys.
Two weeks before Liberation
our camp was attacked,
They shot at us,
I heard them fall one after the other.
The last one I saw was Roger.
I took off.
I ran for hours, 
until I realised no one
was chasing me anymore.
I may have been 
of some use in my life...
but I've never saved anyone's life.
If you continue like that...
The blood won't be able to circulate
they'll end up having to amputate.
That'll teach you to show off
in front of someone else's wife.
Do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si, do, re, mi,
fa, sol, la, si, do, re, mi, fa...
Z, U, R, T, space.
- Y, U, I, O, P...
- Fa, sol, la...
- A, Z, E, R, T...
- Do, re, mi, Fa, sol...
Load.
Unload.
Faster!
First in the qualifying heat...
Pamphyle!
Faster!
First in the last 8: Pamphyle!
First in the quarter-final:
Pamphyle!
"...apparait l'aurore"...
New paragraph.
Faster!
First in the semi-finals:
Pamphyle!
Faster!
I can't go faster than the typewriter!
Pamphyle, Pamphyle!
Faster! Faster!
Ladies and gentlemen...
We are proud to present...
with 491 strokes a minute...
the new speed typing champion...
of Lower Normandy...
Rose Pamphyle!
Monsieur Jean, Rose is in the news!
She's famous!
ROSE PAMPHYLE:
THE CHARMED FINGERS
OF A NORMANDY GIRL
Being famous is not a profession!
It's 435 francs, madame Bourges.
I always knew you had 
something extra! A true virtuosa!
I'd love to come to Paris
to cheer you on...
but my husband doesn't want to.
The French championship !
It must be amazing !
I lost my voice from...
shouting your name
from the grandstands.
I hadn't seen her like that
since our honeymoon!
Ladies and gentlemen, 
I'd like to be able to work in peace!
For the most beautiful Rose of them all!
Oh, that's just great!
Thank you!
Feel like a going for a good time
with me this evening?
We have to celebrate this victory!
It's just that...
I have to train!
She needs to increase her speed
and especially improve her endurance.
'She' doesn't doubt that...
Perhaps but meanwhile she's still well
below the record for France.
Perhaps it might help 'her' if her
trainer gave her the exact scores!
She should trust her trainer more.
And you should speak a little more
politely to your secretary!
- She's a champion, now!
- Yes.
That's good, Rose.
Great, even.
Louis must be proud of you.
He never congratulates me...
He's convinced you'll go far!
But he's a nervous type.
He's so scared to lose face
in front of Bob!
Yes.
Right. After all,
it's all about THEM!
Rose...
You know how men are.
I was hoping they weren't all like that.
You're an odd thing.
What type of man are you hoping for?
One who considers me his equal.
Yes.
- What else?
- Well...
Definitely older than me
but who doesn't act like a kid.
A man with his eye on the future.
A demanding man...
but not completely sure of himself.
It's a lot more fun to have
 someone you can torment.
I've nothing against smokers,
but I'd rather he smoked less.
Who do you mean?
No-one.
No-one in particular.
You haven't lived here for months,
who would leave a message?
My father.
He doesn't know my address and...
I'll be sure to tell him about
your new lifestyle, if he calls.
You think the 
neighborhood doesn't know 
what's going on 
between Echard and you?
What did you do after work?
I left early. 
You seemed odd, all day.
Well... odder than usual.
I'm tired, that's all.
You remembered...
Thank you, Mr Echard.
Happy birthday, my dear.
What powerful lungs!
See? I was right to make you run.
I made it myself.
Eh...
It's original!
Look.
Go ahead.
Type something.
I wouldn't see anything,
 it's stupid.
Au contraire.
Thanks to this you'll learn
to type without looking at the keys.
You'll have one hell of an edge
over your competitors.
You really don't understand
 anything about women.
You're just a spoiled child!
It took me hours to make this blind,
and I did it for you!
No! You did it for Bob, for Marie,
for the whole world,
 but not for me!
We should have more
 evenings like this.
I don't feel like talking.
No problem, buddy.
I got lots of stuff to tell you.
- The other day...
- It's just that Rose...
Has the impression I'm using her.
But I'm doing all this for her.
So she gets the recognition
she deserves.
She doesn't realize
what a gift she has.
She's making incredible
 progress, I swear.
Look who's there...
Been a while since you've
been around, treasure.
Welcome home Echard...
Bottoms up!
[ALL MY APOLOGIES]
Come in.
I think it's time
to take a break.
It'll do us good... both of us
Christmas is coming.
Take a vacation,
spend time with your family.
Who'll help you trim
the tree if I'm gone?
My parents, brothers and  wives
will be here for the holidays.
- There won't be enough bedrooms.
- I'll sleep in the salon.
Just tell your parents
I'm the housekeeper.
Rose.
- I don't want to go back to my father.
- More's the reason.
It's the ideal occasion to make peace.
Sweet dreams, my dear.
Rose!
Who'd have thought to see you here?
You father's spending
Christmas eve at Maurice's.
Do you want me to ask 
someone to give you a lift?
I'm not sure Maurice 
would be happy to see me.
Papa kept it all this time?
Yes. He never stops saying how he
should have never ordered that gadget.
Gotta run, now. I'm making
 dinner for everybody.
I'm very happy to see you!
And SO proud of you...
Do you realize what a life you have?
You have everything 
a modern girl can dream of.
I "have everything a modern
girl can dream of", mom.
It's hard enough just being a girl.
My only talent 
is being able to type fast.
At first I liked it,
it allowed me to stop thinking.
You feel less out of place 
when you think of nothing.
It does one good.
But it doesn't last.
It's not something you can share...
with anyone.
This makes me feel even more strange.
People don't really see me.
They find me too odd to love.
Even papa.
Even Louis.
Still, it's not so hard to see
that I'm a person like anyone else.
You understood that.
Why only you, dammit?
Sorry to wash up here unannounced.
I really didn't know where to go.
You're not spending Christmas
 with Louis?
No, he asked to sleep
elsewhere to night.
What a boor!
He rarely sees his family...
Mr. Taylor is right.
I thought I'd go to the boarding house
but my bicycle has a flat.
I'm not sure I'd make it to
downtown Lisieux in this weather.
Dear, car keys, please.
Helping clients paint their picket fences?
Why not work for free?
To stay in business you can't
just "lend a helping hand".
It's important to have grateful clients.
Grateful...
For a job well done.
Not for grandstanding.
I prefer a small office,
to be closer to the people.
Ah, the people, the people... 
These 'people' must not have
 much respect for you, then?
- Expecting someone, dear?
- No.
Ah, Marie!
What a nice surpiese!
- Where's Bob?
- Good evening, all.
How about the kids?
They send a big kiss.
Anyway they're waiting for me.
I just came to drop off this lady.
Will you tell them,
 or shall I?
Fine, may I present Rose Pamphyle...
Louis' fiancée.
- When were you going to tell us?
- You big dope!
- It's all completely...
- Rude!
A fiancé should welcome
his fiancée at the station.
- Papa!
- He's so shy!
- Mom!
- So, Merry Christmas, gotta run.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Marie.
Rose! Oh!
- Come in.
- Don't stand in the hall.
- Enchanté.
- Come in, come...
Arent you cagey, eh?
How long have you been
seeing each other?
- About a year.
- Not long.
It's about a year that I've
been working at the office.
But Louis took months
to declare his intentions.
No doubt, he thought
he was too old for me.
I never said that.
Well, I'm ten years younger
 than your father, dear.
As you can see
it's lasted over 40 years.
As long as there's love,
 age matters little.
When's the wedding?
We're not that far yet.
I'd rather take our time.
That's all you ever do, is take your time.
You'll regret it 
if the Americans land again.
If one of them is faster
 than you and marries me.
You should stop drinking, dear.
You may have regrets
of your own, tomorrow.
Are these the bottles
 from the Van Gogh?
Eh ! Let's drink to the
fortune lost by my idiot son.
George!
Only he could sidestep
such a windfall. A Van Gogh...
And this good-for-nothing son
took over the office.
If Leonard or Lucien
had taken charge...
Here we go again...
I swear business would
be more prosperous.
No wonder Leonard or Lucien
didn't take over the office.
- They knew what to expect from you.
- Hey you...
Your son is a brillant man.
He would surely show it
if you didn't always criticise him.
"important to be number one" What idiocy!
You got some gall!
It's nice to see a woman in love.
- Welcome among us.
- Welcome.
Cheers!
# Tango... 
berce mon coeur jusqu'au jour.
[Tango des illusions]
Jacqueline Boyer
Hold on, dear.
First thing I'll do 
before the honeymoon...
...is change the decor.
- I'll give that Marie an earful!
- Go on.
It's not so terrible
being engaged for one evening.
You don't know what 
you're saying, you're...
Hmm, TU ! 
We're getting familiar, now!
Nice, huh?
I'll sleep on the canapé.
We're not married yet.
Louis!
Yes?
I'm gonna fight like crazy
 for the championship.
MY father will eat his hat
he'll be so proud of you.
I'd bet against her
without hesitating.
The real question is
will you have the guts Louis?
Double or nothing?
Where is she?
Who?
Your fiancée.
No need to be so smug.
It was so stupid of you
not to bring her.
- I love that girl.
- You're not alone.
It took days
for my mother to calm down.
She's crazy about Rose.
- My word, you're jealous !
- Not at all.
You'd like to keep her just
for yourself, wouldn't you?
Rose is free, to hear you tell it
you'd think we were lovers.
Ah, see?
I was sure
nothing happened yet.
You placed bets on me?
- She likes you, Louis.
- And you like her.
Will you stop trying
to decide for me!
If I'd listened to you a year ago,
she'd have gone back home!
Rose mustn't think of anything
but the championship.
I can lay the world
at her feet, dammit!
You're so proud that the only
woman good enough for you
must be a world champion.
No-one will ever be
good enough for you, Louis.
You should stop reading
all those psychology books.
They don't agree with you.
Poor kid!
Has no chance of becoming
 champion of France...
..and on top of that,
she'll end up an old maid.
Double.
# [ I Love Paris in the Springtime ] #
I look like a nobody...
...I can't go to the
championships dressed like this.
Ah, there'll be worse
than you, I assure you.
Look at this, it's flat.
- Hang on, here's just what you need !
- I can carry on alone.
We'll meet at 8, 
at the hotel, at the latest.
Don't get lost.
- Bye.
Rose, are you gonna wear
that dress, or sew it?
All done.
I'm coming.
Rose, you are...
Ridiculous? I know...
No...
Well... you're...
You're not the same person...
I'm still the same.
The dress is different.
It doesn't seem
too practical for typing.
Fine...
To bed.
See you tomorrow.
You can't do this to me.
I don't have the right to
unsettle you on the eve of..
the most important competition
of your life. Yes.
What makes you think
it'd be my first time?
It's alright Louis. This is 1959.
It's been ages since girls
waited til after marriage.. 
to experience these things.
Alright...
That's one less thing
I need to teach you.
I can do better.
Mademoiselle Leprince-Ringuet,
you're defending your title
of French Champion
for the third time.
And what's more, within the
walls of the House of Japy.
All the major, preferred clients of 
the brand, were specially invited here.
- Are you nervous?
- Do I look nervous?
It's because Annie's the best
 that we sponsor her.
My father, Edmond Japy, has created
a ball bearing carriage,
especially for her.
Ball bearings, Mr Japy?
Yes, you see, 
the stems of adjacent keys
tended to jam in the old machines,
so we started by conceiving
the AZERTY keyboard,
in such a way that the most
contiguous letters in our language...
Simply put, with ball bearings,
you just graze the carriage and... shoom!
No harm done if we leave now
no one would notice.
No, you stay and
you show them what you can do.
Do you think you'll beat your own record
of 500 strokes a minute?
A champion does not think...
she does!
Oh la la! She has all eyes on her.
I'm just a poor dope from nowhere.
It's your greatest asset,
the element of surprise.
One last one, please!
No, not here, my dear.
Monsieur Japy! Over here, over here!
That's it, Gilbert. Monsieur Japy!
One last one.
We're almost done.
Please one last photo.
Mademoiselle, hello.
Which region?
Lower Normandy.
That's her, look!
- Annie!
- Annie! Annie!
Allez, Annie! Bravo!
- Go Annie.
- Go, Annie! Allez!
- Bravo Annie!
- Go Annie!
- Bravo!
Mesdemoiselles!
Hands above your keyboards.
Qualified for the quarter-finals, are:
Leprince-Ringuet, well in the lead,
followed by Leyrac, Cortie, Hubert,
Portes, Meyer, Legendre and Pamphyle.
Qualified for the semifinals, are:
Leprince-Ringuet,
followed at a distance by Leyrac,
Meyer and Pamphyle.
Bravo!
Silence, please.
Right then, Mademoiselle
Leprince-Ringuet will face
Mademoiselle Pamphyle in the final.
Mesdemoiselles,
hands above your keyboards.
Mesdames et Messieurs, 
we're witnessing a rare event:
both our finalists have exactly
the same number of strokes,
that is 498 strokes per minute.
In order to decide
between the finalists,
the jury has decided to have
a 5 minute tie-breaker.
Good, so...
5 minutes.
Everything's on the line for 5 minutes!
Give it all you've got Rose.
 Hear me? All you've got!
I can't take any more.
This is the moment for which
 we worked so hard.
It's good enough
just to have gotten this far.
- I'm fine with it.
- I'm NOT fine with it.
You've been limp since the
start of the compétition!
You wanna disappoint me
in the final too?
I lied to you, Rose,
the 500 strokes a minute
of Leprince-Ringuet,
you passed that quite 
a while ago during training.
You hate me, huh?
That's the whole point.
Make it happen!
Beat it, Gilbert! 
Let me refocus.
Alright refocus, dear, refocus.
Mesdemoiselles,
hands above your keyboards.
Ah, here's the man who beat
my two-time French champion.
It wasn't me who won.
Edmond Japy, pleased to meet you.
- Louis Echard.
- Yes, I know.
Don't make that face.
It's a happy moment, no?
I'll be happy when Rose
is world champion.
Ah, yes. But France
has never beat America.
You really think you're
the man for this situation?
Are you saying it's you, maybe?
Wait...
If you hadn't angered her before,
she would have missed the boat.
Now that you lied to her
about her scores,
you have no more cards 
left to play in New York.
She has two months left
to beat the Americans.
And you know those people will
make any sacrifice for their champions.
I thought I could say the same about you.
Over here, please!
Louis?
Louis?
I love you.
Why are you hiding?
A journalist from the Paris Match
wants to know everything about us.
Maybe you can tell him all the
nice things you think about me.
Watch out, 
Japy offered me a contract!
- Perfect.
- What?!... Perfect?
- You don't think I accepted?!
- It's the chance of a lifetime.
- They have the means to make you win.
- You talk like them!
You can become a star,
tour the world, meet tons of people.
I couldn't care less!
Leave Saint-Fraimbault
and Lisieux once and for all!
- You don't need me anymore, Rose.
- It's you, that I want.
Your place is here.
Accept who you are, dammit!
I love you!
I don't.
You're lying.
You've proved you can lie.
Without the championships,
we would have never 
ended up in the same bed.
You're lying.
You needed it, to win.
I thought you were better than that.
We all make mistakes in our youth.
- Morning.
- Morning.
How much for the typwriter
in the window?
My daughter just has to have it.
Do you realize, papa,
it's the one Rose Pamphyle...
..placed her fingers on 
for the very first time!
Your daughter is great!
A true fount of inspiration!
So?
How much?
Me, Rose Pamphyle,
whether I'm beating a record
or just typing a letter,
I'm always ahead!
And I do it on...
"la Populaire" from Japy.
It's light, modern... 
and it's 'rose'!
La POPULAIRE
Thunder in the air!
On sale in department stores
and the best stationers.
A 'rose' colored machine for Rose...
what an imagination!
# [ Les secretaires Cha Cha Cha ] #
Jack Ary
# Cha cha cha... de la secretaire.
She is surrounded by famous artists.
- #... tac tac tac...
as well as some well meaning kids
who want to dabble in poetry
when they're clearly suited ​​only
for manufacturing cardboard.
- So, Madame Tessier,
- Mademoiselle.
- You knew Rose Pamphyle?
- Yes, yes.
She stayed here when she
first arrived in Lisieux.
A very proper girl !
# Qui fait tac tac tac
aux bouts des doigt.
# Cha cha cha... del la secretaere.
Tac, tac, tac....
France wants to know all about you,
how does it feel to be
the fastest girl in the land?
I honestly think, that speed
is a sign of progress.
One day the world will be
full of keyboards, you'll see.
Everything is speeding up
and not just in sports.
You really think that
speed typing is a sport?
# Voilà le pas des secretaires.
# Dansons le cha cha cha.
- Please.
- Thanks.
# Cha cha cha... de la secretaire.
# Cha cha cha... qui fait tac tac
tac aux bout des doigts.
# Cha cha cha... de la secretaire.
# Voilà le pas des secretaires.
- # Dansons le cha cha cha.
- Welcome back.
La señorita Rose Pamphyle!
Tango... 
berce mon coeur jusqu'au jour.
Why so sullen? C'mere.
Go away.
You managed to discourage even me, treasure.
How many calls will it take you, 
to twig that he'll never pick up?
Your smiles may deceive
all of France, but not me.
If your Louis was too stupid
to see beyond, it's his problem.
You don't know him.
Any man who passes you up
is an imbecile.
Sleep well, Miss Pamphyle?
More fanmail, it never ends.
Everybody loves you,
it's incredible.
[Happy belated birthday]
Papa
The keys are impossible,
and the keyboard too small!
The keyboard's fine.
It's you who's no longer
up to it.
The record set by Susan Hunter
is 512 strokes a minute.
You've never gone past 508.
I don't think you know
who you're up against.
In ten years, Hunter won
5 world championships
and beat her own record
 each time.
I'm sure I can do more than
508 strokes, Mme Shorofsky.
You're lying.
I never lie.
There's really nothing
to celebrate Mr. Japy.
You haven't seen the latest
sales figures of the "Populaire".
Come now, run along ! 
You've made her work for hours.
That's enough.
For you.
Go on, scoot!
There !
What a killjoy!
Is it really necessary to
kiss all the typing champions?
Yes it's a sort of tradition.
And when they lose, you leave them,
standing at the bottom of the podium.
Still part of the tradition?
I knew you weren't stupid.
I've read some books.
Don't stop.
Here you are.
Not a moment too soon.
Bob's worried sick about you.
Aren't you fed up hiding behind him
to tell me what 'you' feel?
What happened to you?
- The last time I saw you like this...
- You'd just dumped me.
Funny you remember, you always
pretended it was no big deal.
You'd say I did the same.
What did Bob have that I didn't?
- You're completely drunk.
- I'm completely sober.
What did he have that I didn't?
Answer!
He proposed that two of us share one life.
Not you.
You left to defend the country,
without promises.
You could have married me before liberation.
And offer you widowhood
 as a wedding gift?
You didn't die in combat, Louis.
Let yourself live, for God's sake.
And you let yourself live,
shut away in this house?
I don't need to prove anything to myself.
I made choices.
You never had that kind of courage.
Every time you embrace Bob,
every time you hold your children
in your arms, you should thank me.
Thank you for what?
I was crazy about you.
And you ...
You preferred the best ...
supporting role.
In Paris, when Rose won ...
she climbed the podium with such joy ...
with that immense smile.
You had that same smile,
the day I saw you with Bob.
I thought I could do
never make her as happy.
I smiled because I felt loved.
I'm scared to death.
Everyone is afraid, Louis.
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the thirty-ninth annual
typewriting championship of the world.
At the Archer theater,
right here in downtown New York City.
We are approaching the quarter-final.
This event is
beyond compare, Gaston.
Absolutely. The organizers
 spent months
composing texts of 
equivalent difficulty
and the same number of characters.
That don't deal with
politics, or religion,
nothing which might offend
or upset the contestants.
We can say without a doubt
that Italy is eliminated.
Look at Hong 
Chi-ling's mastery!
England is tiring,
will she go the distance?
Hunter is dominating
the competition.
And she's still
the favorite this year.
Ladies and gentlemen,
only four countries remain in the semifinals.
The Federal Republic of 
Germany,
France,
the Republic of Korea, and...
the United States of America!
Vai, Rose!
Ladies a gentlemen.
May I have your attention?
The International
Speed Typing Federation
is proud to announce
in the final...
is the United Statesof America...
versus France!
It'll be France head to head
against United States in the final!
What's with the eyes?
You look like Bambi.
Where do you think you're going?
Backstage.
I need to focus.
If you leave now, they'll
realize you're ill at ease.
Ladies and gentlemen,
silence please!
Ladies!
Hands over the keyboards.
They're off!
Only three 5-minute rounds...
separate us from the crowning
of the World Champion, 1959!
Ladies and gentlemen...
the winner of the first round of the final is...
Rose... Pamphyle!
- With 510 strokes a minute.
- Yes! Yes!
Susan Hunter...
just behind
with 509 strokes a minute!
Susan! Susan!
Susan! Susan!
Susan! Susan!
Silence, please.
Ladies,
Hands over the keyboards.
And I thought the French were
only good in the kitchen !
[MY APOLOGIES]
Not bad.
Just in time for the second round.
Well, go on!
Run to your champion
and try to get her back.
If I were you,
I'd probably do the same.
It makes me think...
How will she react to seeing you?
She may fall into your arms...
But she may also reject you.
She'd have every reason to.
Either way, I'd be surprised
if she remained focused.
She'll lose.
So then, all those hours of training,
all those sacrifices,
for what?
So you can destroy everything
 you always dreamed of?
Susan Hunter...
maintains her world record
of 512 strokes a minute!
Rose Pamphyle,
with 506 strokes a minute!
It's incredible!
Pamphyle left the stage!
We'll never let you near her,
you two bit insurer.
You can't give up. Not now.
What do you intend to do,
with this old machine?
It'll slow you down even more.
The old machine's fine.
You started off too fast.
It's always been your problem.
I thought it was yours.
What are they saying? (Was sagen sie?)
No idea. (Keine ahnung)
For some time I've realized ...
I'm only happy when I can help someone.
I let you believe
that you needed my help...
But the minute I saw you
I knew it was me who couldn't do
without you.
Because you make me happy.
It's a declaration of love!
I love you.
Ti amo
Te quiero.
S' agapo.
Ich liebe dich.
If you stay one more minute,
You'll be diqualified.
Any advice before I go back?
Crush her, my dear.
What are you doing?
You can't change machines in the
middle of a world championship!
Look here, if you don't immediately
switch back to "la Populaire"
you'll have to repay every
cent I spent on you!
I already earned you double.
If you won't do it for my father,
do it for me.
That kiss wasn't so special, Gilbert.
Ladies and gentlemen, silence please!
Don't disappoint me, kid.
I bet on you this time!
Ladies...
Hands over the keyboards.
- Last lap for Pamphyle.
- Anything's possible, Gaston.
Pamphyle is sure to trumph,
within easy reach of victory!
Go, go!
Pamphyle seems possessed
by her machine!
Rather, she is possessing
her machine, you mean.
Allez, allez!
Only 40 seconds
to the end of the round.
My God! My God, no!
Pamphyle can no longer type.
What a catastrophy!
You can do it!
- She's faster than the machine.
- I know.
You may think I'm crazy, but the only way
for the machine to keep up with her
is to assemble all the letters
on a single support.
On a mechanism not much bigger
than...
a golfball! It's a golfball!
Let me fix this.
I'll sell it. We split 50 - 50.
Gentlemen,
I have something I think you're
going to be vry interested in.
Immagine a golfball with all
the letters of the keyboard on it.
Great performance, my dear.
Ladies and gentlemen
may I have your attention please!
The International
Speed Typing Federation
is proud to announce...
The International Speed Typing
Federation is proud to announce..

With 515 strokes a minute
smashing the world record,
the winner...

Rose Pamphyle!
Incredible!
Rose Pamphyle is the
the world champion of 1959.

Why the hell d'you come to me?
America for business,
