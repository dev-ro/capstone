- Alice thought for herself.-
Inspired by Alice in the World of the Wonders, Lewis Carroll
… Alice thought for herself: now we will see a film…
… done for children…
… perhaps.
But you do not forget…
… that you must…
… close the eyes…
… because otherwise…
… you will not see anything.
Oh Dear! Oh Dear! I am going to be late!
- the white rabbit said.-
I am going to be late too much!
- the white rabbit said.-
Please, gentleman!
Oh dear, what late is becoming!
- the white rabbit said.-
Oh Dear! Oh Dear!
- the white rabbit said.-
Oh! Will cut my the head!
- the white rabbit said.-

This is going very far.
- Alice said herself.-
Oh! The queen will be furious!
- the white rabbit said.-
Be careful, gentleman!
Wait me, gentleman!
Mary Ann, what you are doing here?
Bring me  other scissors.
- the white rabbit said.-
This time not Mary Ann
I do not speak with you
Leave me alone.
- the white rabbit said at last.
Good heavens!
Repeated the white rabbit.
Mary, Mary!
- the White Rabbit shouted
Mary Ann! Mary Ann!
Mary! Mary! Where is the scissor?
- the White Rabbit asked.-
- the white rabbit screamed.-
If I cannot enter from the door, I will enter from the window
- the white rabbit said.-
Now surely that I am late.
- the white rabbit said.-
Can you climb, Bill?
Climb to the ceiling Bill!
Poor animals.
Bill, look with that loose roofing tile!
Be careful, Bill.
Shut up animals
Why they put all responsibility on Bill?
- Alice thought by herself.-
Bill! Low by the chimney.
- the animals shouted -
I hope not to have forgotten as a kick occurs.
- Alice said herself.-
There is she! Catch her!
- the animals said.-
Nothing of treats this time!
- Alice thought for herself.-
Who are you?
- the caterpillar said.-
and… who are you?
Why?
- the caterpillar asked.-
Get in! I have something important to say!
- the caterpillar said.-
Keep away from that badly genius!
- the caterpillar said.-
Is that all?
No!
- the caterpillar said.-
One side will let you grow, another side will make you shrink.
“One side… the other side…   of what”
Of the fungus.
- the caterpillar said.-
Leave me alone now, so that I can sleep.
- the caterpillar said weakly.-
It works well...  But not as much as I hoped
- thought Alice at the same time.-
Enter…
an invitation for Alice from Queen.
- the lacayo-fish said.-

- the lacayo-toad repeated.-
Alice? Alice? But that one is me.
- said Alice at the same time.-

In what looks like a crow to a writing-desk?
