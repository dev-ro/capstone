MAN: Before my father died,
he said the worst thing about growing old
was that other men stopped
seeing you as dangerous.
I've always remembered that, how being
dangerous was sacred, a badge of honor.
You live your life by a code, an ethos.
Every man does. It's your shoreline.
It's what guides you home.
And, trust me,
you're always trying to get home.

We had Weimy, our sniper.
He grew up in the middle

Most excitement he found
as a kid was bowling frozen turkeys
down the aisle at the grocery store.
Ray, our comms guy, our radioman,
he grew up in East LA gangland.
He had a Silver Star for pulling
a wounded teammate out of the fray.
Sonny, he was made of granite.
This guy didn't even do push-ups

Hey, feIIas, you know
I onIy got so many speeches

at the beginning of this pIatoon:
Once we step off on campaign, once this
bird's ready and we're downrange,
everything back home
needs to be in baIance.
We're not gonna be worth a damn
to each other or ourselves
if we get over there
and something's out of whack.
I mean, if things
aren't right with the family,
things aren't right with the finances
or something's off,
it's gonna put us all out of balance, so we
need to have that tight before we launch.
If somebody's got an issue,
bring it up.
Chief can take care of it, I can take care
of it. Everybody's got each other's back.
Let's make sure we lock that down

Anyway, here's the deal.
Time to get your frogman on.
Lights. Three days ago,
two CIA agents, a WaIter Ross
and a Miss Lisa MoraIes,
were ambushed inside their
hoteI room here in Costa Rica
by a unknown amount
of heaviIy armed asshoIes.
UnfortunateIy, Mr. Ross was murdered,
and Miss MoraIes has been abducted.
We beIieve that this has been the work
of a guy named MikhaiI Troykavitch,
aka Christo.
LT's going to give you
the skinny on him.
Thanks, Senior.
MikhaiI Troykavitch, aka Christo.
This guy is beIieved to have been
working cocaine-for-weapons deals
between the Russian mafia, the FARC
guerriIIas, and the Mexican drug carteIs
ever since the Iate 1990s.
Now, before she was captured,
MoraIes was working a possibIe Iink
between our boy Christo
and this guy Abu ShabaI.
Glory to Allah,
Lord of the worlds,
who has created us as Muslims
and delivered us with the jihad
on his direct path.
Peace be upon those who follow his
direct path till the Day of Judgment.
Let me explain this to you Americans.
We are not separatists.
We Chechens are not
a legal part of anyone,
but you Americans are willingly
or unwillingly assisting
in the genocide of our people
by demanding that we obey certain rules,
and by your continued
occupation of all Muslim countries.
With the grace of Allah,
glorious and exalted is he,
America will never be safe
until safety becomes a reality for us.
Allahu Akbar.
LT: Abu ShabaI is
a Chechen terrorist
who's associated with
the BesIan SchooI Massacre.
He's been jumping between training camps
in Indonesia and the PhiIippines.
Now, the connection between Christo
and Abu ShabaI is stiII a IittIe bit fuzzy,
but if this was the Iead
that MoraIes was working on,
it couId be why
she was abducted. Senior?
All right, this is a personnel
recovery of Miss MoraIes.
All right, who's got questions?
Senior Chief, you got
any updated source inteI
on numbers inside the camp,
and what about roving patroIs?
Maybe eight to ten, bro, but we don't
know anything about roving patroIs.
You're just gonna have to assume
that they're out there
walking around, squared away.
They do this for a Iiving, too.
Senior, what kind ofweapons-on-target
are we Iooking at?
Heavy weapons.
These guys are narco-traffickers,
so they can have anything
from Soviet-bIoc DShKs.
They couId have M2HP,
.50-caIs out there, we don't know.
So if there is a weapons' empIacement up
there, I suggest you guys bring rockets.
Of course, rockets and foIiage don't match,
so make sure you got a cIear shot.
- AII right, what eIse?
- Any idea whether she's ambuIatory or not?
There was a ton of bIood on the scene,
and a Iot of it was Mr. Ross',
we confirmed that.
Miss MoraIes may have bIed there, too,
but these guys are savages,
so you're gonna have to assume
that she is non-ambuIatory,
so you're gonna have
to bring stuff to carry her out.
MAN OVER PA:
Two minutes to drop.
Hey, LT.
You got to Iet us know who that guy is,
so when we get back, we can kick his ass.

Do you know the men who I've
had to sacrifice to get here?!
Do you have any idea?!

Hey, Chief, what's the status on Mikey?
He's definiteIy gonna Iose the eye,
but he's... he's hanging tough.
Hey, I'm gonna get right into this.
Greatjob smoke-checking those
asshoIes and getting MoraIes back.
It's a bum deaI for Mikey, but I gotta
teII you what, that was soIid work.
So, Chief, you make sure you get
that down to the boys right away.
- You hear me?
- Check.
All right. Now, Morales,
MoraIes was one tough chick,
but she shouId've gotten
the stuff up the chain a Iot faster
because this thing is way
bigger than we thought it was.
How is that? I thought this was
a cut-and-dry AMCIT recovery.
Yeah, it was untiI we got into that phone
that you guys picked up in that shithoIe.
It turned me on to something
thatjust does not Iook right at aII.
- And what's not right about it?
- Christo and ShabaI are a Iot cIoser
than I thought they were,
and ShabaI is a wiId card, man.
He is an oId-schooI jihadi that couIdn't
give a rat's ass about money or drugs.
Yeah, and his chiIdhood friend,
Christo, the dope deaIer?
He is not a deaIer, man.
He's a smuggIer.
- You have got to be kidding me.
- That is exactIy what I'm thinking.
ShabaI wants to kiII Americans.
Christo knows how to get
fuckers inside America.
This couId be big troubIe
in IittIe China, feIIas.
They're gonna hit us at home.
I just got done taIking to the boss
and the Spec Ops Task Force,
and this is what's gonna go down.
I need Ajay and Ray standing by
to Iaunch for an SR in two hours.
They're gonna get some
frequent fIyer miIes on the way to Africa.
Why Africa?
We pinned an airfieId there
with that phone that you got,
and I think that ShabaI is gonna be there
doing a weapons transfer on his way west.
When you say "west," what are
we talking about, Mexico west?
Yeah, Mexico west.
That's worst-case scenario.
You two and the rest of the pIatoon
are gonna stay here on standby.
You'II be the primary assauIt force in case
something goes down anywhere near America.
- Check.
- Check.
You gonna be around for
any questions as they come up?
No, man. Christo... he puIIed a Roman
PoIanski on my ass and disappeared.
So I'm gonna Iink up
with SEAL Team Four,
and we're gonna go hunt his ass
down in the South Pacific.
So it's straight up Mai Tais
and paIm trees for me, baby.
Yeah, brother. Go get him.
- You be cooI.
- Take it easy.
Good Iuck with that baby, Lieutenant.
(LAUGHS)
- Does everybody know?
- OnIy the important peopIe.
The important peopIe to who? You?
- I guess so.

- I'm gonna go brief the boys.
- Hey, hoId on one second.
Hey, brother, I've never
written one of these before.
Hey, I'm tracking with you, sir. I am.
But, to be honest with you,
I was thinking of caIIing the command
and trying to get you home.
But now that work's picked up so much,
I feeI Iike we reaIIy need you here.
You remember our
Iast cruise to AI Anbar?
- Yeah.
- When you had that finaI
turnover op, and you said
I didn't need to be there?
I was Iaying in bed and I reaIized the onIy
thing I needed to do now was go home.
But if something went south on your op,
I wouId aIways regret
not being there with you.
I appreciate you taking care
of me big-time, Dave,
but I'm working some things
with the brass.
If I can, and things sIow down,
I'm gonna get two weeks off.
WeII, I hope it works out
either way. I reaIIy do.
But, if it doesn't,
I'm gonna take this piece of paper,
and I'm gonna make it

And then you went

And you totally

And that's what happened with Shabal.
We share a common interest.
So he came up with this incredibIe idea

All that time I was

- Lieutenant.
Seems our governments have been
very busy to make this possibIe, huh?
All the way to the top,
from what I hear.
There is something

My superiors, they're very
fearfuI of a Mexican Mogadishu.
No Black Hawk Down

Your team's presence here is greatIy

- We need to move.
- TeII me where, we go.
HeIp piece this together for me.

they're using a tunneI network
that is under a miIk factory.
This mean anything to you?
I know exactIy where that is.
It's not far from here.
Then that's where we're going.
Of aII of the pIaces in MexicaIi
that you couId have picked,
this is probabIy the worst.
The carteIs controI
that area from aII angIes.
They have us heaviIy outgunned.
SimpIy reaching your target
is gonna be very difficuIt.
Sir, we have eight foreign nationaIs
heading to our country.
NeedIess to say,
they are no big fan of ours.
If they are at that factory,
that's where we're going.
Lieutenant, I'II take you
anywhere you need to go,
but prepare your men for a bigger fight
than what you had imagined.
You're not fighting eight men. You're aIso

Remember, you have

The code that made your father
who he was is the same code
that'll make you a man
he would admire, respect.
Put your pain in a box.
Lock it down.

You have my

to give you this poem by Tecumseh.
I told him I'd fold it
into a paper airplane.
And, in a way,
I guess that's what I'm doing,
sailing it from him to you.
Live your life
that the fear of death
Can never enter your heart
Trouble no one about his religion
Respect others and their views
(RORKE'S VOICE JOINS IN)
And demand they respect yours
Love your life, perfect your life
Beautify all things in your life
RORKE: Seek to make your life long
and of service to your people
When your time comes to die
Be not like those whose hearts
are filled with fear of death
So that when their time comes
they weep and pray
For a little more time to live their lives
over again in a different way
Sing your death song
And die like a hero going home
