Sebastian.
Sebastian, let's try and focus.
What can I possibly say?
I'm a fool.
- You're not a fool.
- Yes, I am.
I can't feel sorry for myself
because I'm a poor little rich boy.
It's not your fault.
Adolescence is a difficult time.
And without great parenting,
things can go awry.
But you have to
rise above their mistakes.
Here.
- Autographed copy! Can I keep this?
- It's yours.
You have to stop
being so hard on yourself.
What's in the past is over.
You're right.
It's hard to believe
there was once a time...
...when the only thing
I could think about was sex.
- It's no way to go through life.
- I know.
I mean, take yourself, for example.
You're an attractive woman.
You have killer legs.
I would love to photograph them.
That was the old me.
I'm cured now.
I'm so proud of you.
Same time next week?
Didn't I tell you?
I'm going on my book tour.
I'll be back in a month.
Why?
Because other people
need my help too.
You're gonna do just fine.
I hope so.
If you need anything at all,
don't hesitate to call my service.
I could use a hug.
Alrighty.
There you go.
Yes?
- Your daughter on one.
- Tell her to hold.
- This her?
- That's my Marci.
- She seems nice.
- She's great.
Straight-A student,
exceptionally rounded young woman.
She's attending Princeton this fall.
Now this is exactly
the type of girl I should be with.
She's a little out of your league.
- No offense.
- Oh, well.
Take good care of yourself.
Thank you for everything.
Schmuck.
- Yes?
- Your daughter's still holding.
Hi, honey.
- You kept me on hold?
- I'm sorry.
Is something wrong?
He told me he loved me.
And I believed him.
I'm so stupid.
Now, darling, it's all right.
Just calm down, take a deep breath,
step out of the circle.
Would you cut your
psychobabble bullshit, Mom?
There's pictures of me
on the Internet.
What kind of pictures?
- Nudie pictures! What do you think?
- Slut, slut, slut...
How could you be so stupid?!
He was just so charming.
And all he did was say
how I had killer legs...
...and how he wanted
to photograph them.
And things just got
completely out of hand.
You are a slut, you are a slut,
you are a slut...
Mom? Are you there?
Mom?
Mother!
Sebastian. Sebastian!
You're gonna pay for this,
you little shit! Do you hear me?
You sicko pervert!
What's her problem?
Looks like somebody's
in need of some therapy.
You won't get away with this.
Get away from me!
So, what's your name?
- Clorissa.
- Clorissa.
- God, you're beautiful.
- Thank you.
- I'm gonna take you to lunch.
- Okay.
Sir, there's no parking.
You can't park, sir!
I can't tell you how happy we are...
...that Cecile will be attending
Manchester with you.
You've always been an inspiration
to Beau and I on raising her.
We hope she can rise to the high
standards which you've set for her.
I'll do my best.
- What was that?
- I was thanking her.
Vietnamese is a beautiful language,
don't you think?
Kathryn's one of
the most popular girls at school.
Listen to whatever she has to say,
and you'll go far.
How do you do it?
Where do you get your strength?
I know this sounds corny...
...but whenever I feel
the temptation of peer pressure...
...I turn to God and he helps me
through the problem.
That's beautiful.
What are the boys like?
Cecile, is that all you can think of?
You must forgive her.
She's never been in
a coeducational atmosphere before.
It's perfectly understandable.
Most boys that matriculate at
Manchester are upstanding gentlemen.
However, there are
the occasional few bad apples.
Like your stepbrother, Sebastian.
He wasn't expelled for what he did
to the school nurse?
I hear she's recovering quite well.
Nice to see you again, Mrs. Caldwell.
You remember my daughter?
My, what an adorable shirt
you're wearing!
Thanks.
My father took me to Australia.
How are things down under?
- Blossoming, I hope.
- Sebastian!
I'm so sorry.
I think we'll be going now.
Thank you for your help.
I'll call you
and we can plan your curriculum.
Okay, thanks.
It was nice meeting you.
Let's go, Cecile. Now.
Keep your legs together.
This isn't Jamaica.
I didn't know it was Asshole Day
at the Valmont house.
Just taking the poor girl
under my wing.
- The parental units called.
- Lovely.
How is your gold-digging whore
of a mother enjoying Bali?
She suspects that your impotent,
alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
Good.
What's wrong with you today?
Therapy not going well?
It was fine.
Clorissa. "Call me!"
I'm sick of sleeping with
these insipid Manhattan debutantes.
Nothing shocks them anymore.
You can relax.
I have a mission for you.
What?
Remember Court Reynolds?
Son of Garret Reynolds?
You mean the Nazi who dumped you
over Fourth of July weekend?
I went to great lengths
to please Court.
Huge sacrifices were made
on my part to keep him happy.
- Sorry.
- In any event...
...my feelings were hurt when I learned
that Court had fallen for someone else.
You don't mean...?
None other than Cecile Caldwell.
So that's what this is all about.
Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer.
When I get through with Cecile,
she'll be New York's premier tramp.
And poor Court's little princess
will be damaged goods.
Why go through Cecile?
Why not just attack Court?
If an attack is made on Court,
it could be traced back to me.
And I can't allow that to happen.
Everybody loves me,
and I intend to keep it that way.
I see your point.
Why should I care?
I need you to seduce Cecile.
She's quite cute, you know.
Young, supple breasts.
A tight, firm ass.
Uncharted pooty.
Be her Captain Picard, Valmont.
Boldly go...
...where no man has gone before.
I can't.
Why not?
Come on, Kathryn.
It's too easy.
Go get one of
your moron friends to do it.
I have a reputation to uphold.
Diddling the therapist's daughter
is a challenge?
She was overcharging.
This is a challenge.
I know how to alleviate
menstrual cramps.
Shut up and turn to page 64.
"Why I Plan to Wait"...
...by Annette Hargrove,
Kansas City, Kansas.
Jesus Christ! Is she for real?
She's daddy's little angel.
A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
Let's see.
Boring, boring, boring.
"I love my parents."
Boring, boring, boring.
"Making a mature decision."
Here.
She has a boyfriend named Trevor.
"Going out for a year.
Trevor understands."
Trevor's a fag.
Too bad for you,
she lives in Kansas.
The virgin's father has accepted
the headmaster position at our school.
She's staying with my aunt
while her parents sell their house.
Can you imagine what this will do
for my reputation?
Screwing the new headmaster's
daughter before school starts.
She'll be my greatest victory.
You don't stand a chance.
Even this is out of your league.
Care to wager on that?
I'll think about it.
Oh, well. Duty calls.
Dr. Greenbaum and her daughter
should make for an exciting entry.
Gee, your journal.
Could you be more queer?
Could you be more desperate
to read it?
Oh, Sebastian?
Could you come here for a second?
About that little wager of yours?
Count me in.
What are the terms?
If I win...
...then that hot little car
of yours is mine.
And if I win?
I'll give you what
you've been obsessing about...
...ever since our parents got married.
Be more specific.
In English...
...I'll fuck your brains out.
What makes you think
I'd go for that bet?
That's a 1956 Jaguar roadster.
Because I'm the only person
you can't have, and it kills you.
No way.
You can put it anywhere.
You got yourself a bet, baby.
Happy hunting, Sebastian.
Your home is beautiful,
Mrs. Rosemond.
Thank you, Annette. It's been
in my family for over 100 years.
Does your family ride much?
My grandpa used to breed horses
on his farm.
Really?
What was that?
Sebastian must be home.
Pull!
Sebastian.
Fuck me!
- Aunt Helen!
- Sweet pea.
God, I've missed you!
I've been looking all over for you.
I missed you too.
I want you to meet Annette.
Annette Hargrove, this is Sebastian.
- Well, well.
- Hello.
She'll be staying with me
for a few weeks.
I guess that makes two of us.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
Aunt Helen, why don't you whip us up
some of that iced tea of yours?
I'll tend to Annette.
All right.
You two don't get into any trouble.
- We won't.
- We won't.
Come on.
Quickly. Lots to see.
- I read your manifesto.
- You did?
I must say,
I found it rather appalling.
That's a first.
Most people praised me for it.
Most people are sheep.
Who are you to criticize
something you've never experienced?
I wasn't criticizing anything.
I believe people shouldn't experience
the act of love until they're in love.
People our age aren't mature enough
to experience those emotions.
Are you a lesbian?
No.
I didn't mean to offend you.
I just picked up on a lesbian vibe.
I wouldn't expect a man of your
experience to understand my beliefs.
What's that supposed to mean?
I've been very well-informed
of your reputation.
What have you heard?
That you promise girls the world
to get them in bed.
Who told you this?
A friend wrote me.
That's a little tacky.
Why are you so surprised?
Isn't it the truth?
If you say so.
That's good.
Now let's try the G-major scale.
Once again.
And remember, the third note is sharp.
I suck! I suck!
Relax, okay?
Take a deep breath.
You're concentrating too much
on bowing. Just let it flow.
Here, let me help you.
Now close your eyes.
Mai-Lee, be careful!
We've had this discussion.
My apologies.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
Your playing was beautiful.
This is Ronald Clifford.
He'll be giving me
music lessons this summer.
Nice to meet you.
Likewise, I'm sure.
Ronald is attending pre-Juilliard.
He's composing his first opera.
It's based on
Dr. Martin Luther King's life.
Dr. King is my favorite.
Well, I guess our hour is up.
Same time tomorrow?
Bye.
Unbelievable.
- Some fag, no offense...
- None taken.
...wrote a letter to this chick
describing my lascivious tactics.
Any ideas who it is?
If I knew who it was, that person would
be in a momentous amount of pain.
- Where's the little girl from?
- Kansas.
Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
- Greg McConnell.
- The football stud?
He's from Kansas City.
I think he might be your rat.
It would make sense.
McConnell hates me.
I fingered his girlfriend
at homecoming last year.
I don't think
that bothered him so much.
What do you mean?
Let's just say Greg likes to tackle
the tight ends on and off the field.
Are you shitting me?
I shit you not.
He used to sneak into
my dorm room drunk every month.
We'd go at it for a while.
As soon as he'd come,
he'd start freaking out.
"What are you doing?
I'm not a fag.
If you tell anybody,
I'm gonna kick your ass!"
The only reason
I let him keep up the charade...
...is because the man's got a mouth
like a Hoover.
Shit! Too bad he's
in Kansas this summer.
Not anymore.
The football team started practice.
He's back in the dorm.
He already called me
for a pillow-kissing session.
Good for you.
Could you arrange a get-together
with him tonight on my behalf?
I do believe Spartacus is showing
on television tonight.
Outstanding.
But don't think this one's
not gonna cost you.
Just make sure
your front door is unlocked.
Shall we say, the stroke of midnight?
No pun intended.
The stroke of midnight it is.
So then I take out my dick.
And I shove it right in her face.
And I stand there like,
"What the hell is this?
Grandma with the birthday present?
Suck it, dumb bitch!"
The Gregster!
Yes, the Gregster!
Yes.
- Hey.
- Gregory?
Hi, Blaine.
Rumor has it that you went on a date
with Court Reynolds.
I hear he's very nice.
He's all right.
He kept talking about
a bulimic head case...
...he dumped
over the Fourth of July.
- Really? "Bulimic head case."
- Yeah.
What a loser she must be!
Sorry.
Anyhow, Court's invited me to
the Hamptons for Labor Day weekend.
That's great!
You think so?
I don't know.
I guess I'm just scared.
Of what?
Boys. I've never even gone
to first base with a guy.
Haven't you ever practiced on
one of your girlfriends?
No. That's gross.
It's not gross.
How else do you think girls learn?
Okay, face me.
Now close your eyes
and wet your lips.
Are you for real?
You wanna learn or not?
I guess.
See? That wasn't so scary.
It was nothing.
Okay, let's try it again.
This time, I'm gonna stick
my tongue in your mouth.
And when I do that, I want you
to massage my tongue with yours.
And that's what first base is.
Okay.
Eyes closed.
Not bad.
That was cool.
Maybe you should try it
on your friend Ronald some time.
What are you saying?
Come on, Cecile.
It's obvious.
He's crazy about you.
He sends me letters, you know.
Love letters.
That's so romantic.
Have you responded?
- No.
- Well, don't you like him?
I do like him.
I think about him all the time.
What if my mother found out?
She would kill me.
You hid the letters, right?
In an antique dollhouse in my room.
Okay. I want you to bring copies
of the letters to me.
Why?
Because one thing I'm great at
is love letters.
With my help, Ronald will be eating
out of the palm of your hand.
Maybe we could even arrange a
get-together for you two at my house.
You'd do that for me?
Of course, silly.
We're friends, right?
Best friends.
Do you wanna have a sleepover?
Hello?
Excuse me.
What a pleasant surprise!
You aware this music is playing
in every room?
It's not, just yours.
I thought you'd be pleased.
So, what are you doing in your room?
Reading.
Anything interesting?
Yes. Actually, it's quite intriguing.
For you.
Something to start
the new school year with.
- You didn't have to do this.
- You hate it. It's lame.
No, I love it.
You just didn't have to do it.
Can you pry yourself away
and join me for a swim?
I know it's late, being 10:00,
but we are reasonably young.
I suppose your proposal
was only mildly insulting.
So maybe I'll consider it.
Give me a minute.
- Fuck her yet?
- I'm working on it.
Loser.
- Blow me.
- Call me later?
Okay.
Sebastian?
Would you turn around
so I can put on my bathing suit?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
So embarrassing.
It amazes me someone as charming
as you can be so manipulative.
We're not gonna start
this letter nonsense again?
What was my favorite part?
Right.
"Even more treacherous
than he is attractive...
...he has never uttered a single word
without some dishonorable intention.
Every woman he's successfully
pursued has regretted it.
Stay away from him."
Have the decency of telling me
who's badmouthing me...
...so I might have the opportunity
to confront them.
Not a chance.
You're right, you know.
About what?
About what you said today.
I've done some things
I'm not proud of.
Look, I wasn't trying
to give you a hard time.
I mean, I look at you
with all your morals and values...
...and you seem to be happy
in your choices.
I envy you.
No bullshit.
Really?
Seriously.
And you've got
everything going for you.
You're smart, you're beautiful,
you're determined.
You're everything I'd want
in a girlfriend.
You know I'm seeing someone.
Oh, yes, the infamous Trevor.
It's funny how you haven't
mentioned him until now.
He's backpacking through Europe.
He's great.
I really miss him.
I care.
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
- Honestly?
- Honestly.
"You're smart, you're beautiful.
Determined"?
Listing my qualities
won't get you anywhere with me.
The best you can hope for
is my friendship.
You're really walking
a fine line at that.
Good night, sweet pea.
Baby!
"Baby"?
Right on time.
Shit!
- Give me my fucking underwear!
- All right, don't get so huffy.
What do we have here?
Look, this is the first time
I've ever done anything like this.
- I was just...
- Really drunk and blah-blah-blah.
Please don't tell anyone.
This could ruin my whole career, man.
Your career?
What about your family?
Imagine the humiliation
your father will feel...
...when he finds out
his pride and joy's a fudge-packer.
I'll do anything.
Let's just forget
about this whole thing.
No.
Can't help you there.
After all, it's you who's
badmouthing me to Annette Hargrove.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
You're the only one who knows her.
The truth will save you.
I never said a word to her about you.
I promise.
Come to think of it,
he's probably telling you the truth.
He can barely write a grocery list,
let alone a letter.
What was I thinking?
All right.
I believe you.
Your secret's safe with me.
Actually...
...there is something
you can do for me.
So, what else do you know
about Sebastian?
He's smart as hell, you know?
He's really dedicated
to achieving his goals.
Always gives 110 percent.
He's always watching my back.
He's got a bad rap...
...but it's mostly bullshit.
I don't know. I've been hearing
awful things about him.
Oh, yeah? From who?
I can't really say.
I'm sworn to secrecy.
How long have we known each other?
- Forever.
- Exactly.
Now, it's my job
to look out for you, right?
You're like a sister to me.
Besides, do I look like
some kind of gossip queen to you?
It's me. Greg. The Gregster.
I'm serious.
- You promise not to tell anybody?
- Annette...
...I swear to you on my mama's life.
That nosy bitch!
Are you sure?
Positive, man.
She said, "Mrs. Caldwell."
They met at orientation.
Okay, next.
Did you do everything I asked?
- Yeah.
- Did she buy it?
I'm pretty sure.
"Pretty" sure or "sure" sure?
She bought it.
She tried to outdo me with
a one-handed cartwheel...
...which is stupid,
because I told her I could do this...
...for a really long time.
My best friends,
Sue, Kelly and Frances...
You see what I mean...?
- You okay?
- Yeah.
You won't believe what I found out...
- Shit, it's my mom! Gotta go.
- I should go too.
I'll see you tomorrow?
Absolutely.
Goodbye.
Peace out.
"Peace out"?
Moron!
What's wrong?
Are you ready for this?
I've discovered that Mrs. Caldwell
sent the letter to Annette...
...urging her to stay away from me.
- Interesting.
- Yes, it is.
I now plan to devote all my energies
to destroying the douche bag.
The plot thickens.
It appears that Cecile
has fallen for her music teacher.
I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
Unfortunately,
our Don Juan is moving...
...with the speed
of a Special Olympic hurdler.
What's your plan of attack?
I rat Cecile out to Mommy.
Mommy goes ballistic
and ends the relationship. Boo-hoo.
But who will they turn to for help?
Cecile is planning on going away
with Court next week.
I'll need you to speed up
her sexual awakening.
I'm at your service.
Thank you.
That feels good.
Sis, you're so tense.
I know.
I hate it when things
don't go my way.
It makes me so horny.
I hate it too.
Seems like things
are looking up for you.
It appears so.
Any luck with your girl?
Moving along quite well.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Any day now.
Well, let me know when you do.
Until then...
...down, boy.
Come on!
- Hello.
- Hi, it's Sebastian.
- Hi.
- I didn't wake you, did I?
- No, not at all.
- Good.
Did I leave my glasses there?
I don't think so.
All right.
I guess I'll see you around.
Is that really why you're calling?
No.
I called you because
I missed talking to you.
A moment of honesty.
Don't get used to it.
I'm not liking it too much.
What are you doing tomorrow?
I'm going out with you.
That's ridiculous.
I got your message
and came as quick as I could.
- I didn't keep you from something?
- Not at all. What's wrong?
- It's Cecile.
- What about her?
You promise you won't say anything?
You have my word.
It isn't drugs, is it?
It's worse.
I think there's something going on
between Cecile and her music teacher.
Ronald? That's crazy.
I know. She's so young
and he's so...
Black!
Brown sugar. No sugar.
He's been sending her love letters
that she hides under her dollhouse.
I questioned whether or not
to tell you...
...but this could destroy
her reputation at Manchester.
I hope I was right to tell you.
I'd hate to see Cecile
ruin things with Court.
I can't thank you enough.
You will be discreet about this?
Absolutely.
Who the hell do you think you are?
Excuse me?
I'm paying you to give cello lessons,
not to pervert my child.
Mrs. Caldwell, I think
you're misunderstanding.
You care to explain this?
Where did you find those?
Margarita found them while cleaning.
- Now, you go to your room.
- Mom.
Now!
How dare you treat me
with such disrespect!
I got you off the streets.
This is how you repay me?
Got me off the streets?
I live at 59th and Park.
Whatever!
Never set foot in this house again!
And you are never
to see my daughter again.
Is that understood?
First of all...
...I never touched your daughter.
And second, I would think...
...someone of your stature
could look beyond racial lines.
Don't give me any of
that racist crap!
My husband and I gave money
to Colin Powell.
I guess that puts me in my place.
Thank you for your hospitality,
Mrs. Caldwell.
It was a true awakening.
The black man is gone!
The black man is gone!
Yes, sir, the black man is gone!
I never knew she had these feelings.
You're a lucky guy.
So, what do I do?
You should tell her you love her.
Are you kidding me?
Mrs. Caldwell will have me shot
if I go near her.
She doesn't have her own phone.
I don't know her e-mail address.
Ronald, e-mail is for geeks
and pedophiles.
Be romantic.
Write her another letter.
How will I get it to her?
- We'll make sure she gets it.
- We'll make sure she gets it.
Why are you doing this for me?
Because...
Because we wanna see Cecile happy.
And we know...
...that you'd make her happy.
You'd make any girl happy.
You guys mind
if I have some privacy?
Use my room.
It's right across the hall.
Make yourself at home.
- Who are you calling?
- Cecile.
What are you doing?
Before we do this, I want you
aware of the damage we'll cause.
I'm aware.
Are you really?
We've done some pretty
fucked-up shit before, but this...
You do realize
we're destroying an innocent girl?
Court Reynolds is going down.
If you won't help...
...somebody else will.
You amaze me.
Eat me, Sebastian.
It's all right for guys
to fuck everyone...
...but when I do it, I get dumped
for innocent little twits like Cecile.
God forbid I exude
confidence and enjoy sex.
Do you think I relish
acting like Mary Sunshine 24/7...
...so I can be considered a lady?
I'm the Marcia-fucking-Brady
of the Upper East Side...
...and sometimes
I wanna kill myself.
There's your psychoanalysis,
Dr. Freud.
Now, tell me...
...are you in or are you out?
Call her.
Hello?
Cecile, it's Kathryn.
Okay, stop crying.
Stop crying.
You know what?
Hold on for Sebastian.
Cecile, stop crying.
I need you to listen to me
very carefully.
I have a letter from Ronald.
He asked me to give it to you.
I can't bring it to you,
since your mother despises me.
Here's what we're gonna do.
Finished.
This sure doesn't taste
like an iced tea.
It's from Long Island.
- How's the letter?
- It's excellent.
You think he'll like it?
Oh, my God, he'll love it.
Are you kidding?
What are you doing?
Just taking your photo.
You know, you could be a model.
Really?
It's too bad you're not sexy.
I can be sexy.
All right, show me sexy.
That's very sexy.
Make yourself more comfortable.
No, no, no. Come here.
Now, that's sexy.
- Cecile.
- What?
You know what would be
super-duper sexy?
If you lost all the clothes.
I don't think so.
I'm sorry.
That was out of line.
I think I should go home now.
I'll call your mom
and have her pick you up.
My mom? You can't call my mom.
Oh, wow.
She doesn't know you're here.
In fact, you're probably grounded.
- I think I should call her anyway.
- No, please!
Please. I'll do anything!
Just don't call my mom.
All I wanna do is give you a kiss.
Just a kiss?
I swear.
What are you doing?
You promised to let me kiss you.
But then why...?
I don't wanna kiss you here.
I wanna kiss you there.
A promise is a promise.
That tickles.
Cecile, are you up yet?
You're going to be late for the...
Cecile.
I need a hug.
Cecile.
Yeah?
Jesus Christ!
Where have you been?
- Shopping?
- Well, hurry up!
You're to be at
Mrs. Rosemond's before brunch.
She's important to the school.
And I want you to look
your best, all right? Okay, go.
Afternoon, ladies.
I didn't know you'd be here.
I wasn't planning on it,
but being such a lovely day...
...why waste it in the city?
Good point.
Anyone for tennis?
Excuse me.
That was rude.
She's very strange.
What am I going to do?
Is something wrong?
That was Mrs. Collins.
They need volunteers
at the retirement home.
But I have theater tickets.
That's terrible.
I have a thought.
Why don't you two fill in for me?
- I'd love to.
- You two are the best.
Thank you.
So sweet of you.
Can't help it.
Stop it.
Isn't he beautiful?
It's so wonderful when young people
come by to help out.
Most of our patients
don't have family nearby.
Here we are. Mr. Gottlieb?
We have a visitor for you.
No, I've got somebody special
for you, baby. Come on.
Did I ever tell you the time
when my late husband...?
- Yes, you already did, Mrs. Sugarman.
- I did?
Right after we played backgammon.
We played backgammon?
- You beat me three times.
- I did?
Then I fucked your daughter.
Excuse me?
I said, "Would you care
for some water?"
No, thank you.
Come in.
Hi, how's it going in here?
We played backgammon.
And I won three times.
- I did! I did!
- You go on with your bad self!
Isn't it wonderful?
See, I told you she was special.
Oh, my, that was fun.
It's weird.
I actually feel good about myself.
Mrs. Sugarman's cool.
- Come on.
- What?
- Mrs. Sugarman's cool?
- She is.
- You must think I'm a real idiot.
- No, I don't.
You had a good time
with that old lady?
I did.
We played three games
of backgammon.
I was bored out of my mind.
I hate doing charity.
It's okay.
It doesn't make you a bad person.
- Yes, it does.
- No, it doesn't.
I can't win with you.
It's not about winning.
You know what your problem is?
You take yourself way too seriously.
- I do not.
- Yes, you do.
You should lighten up.
I am lightened.
Can we drop this?
Fine.
What are you doing?
Stop it! It's distracting.
Cut it out!
Stop that.
- Are you smiling?
- No.
No?
Will you stop?
It's okay. You can laugh.
I promise I won't tell anybody.
Who is it?
Kathryn.
- Are you okay?
- No.
Calm down.
Tell me what's wrong.
Something awful happened last night.
What do you mean?
I don't think you wanna know.
You have to tell me.
It involves your brother.
He took advantage of me.
Why didn't you do something?
I don't know.
Let me get this straight.
You came to our house last night,
and he forced intercourse on you?
Not exactly.
- He made you give him a blowjob?
- No.
Well, what, then?
He took down my pants
and wrote the alphabet...
...but he was writing it
with his tongue.
He went down on you?
If that's what you call it.
- Did you like it?
- No.
- No?
- Well...
I don't know. It was weird.
I mean, at first, it felt icky
and then it was sort of okay.
Then I started getting really hot.
And then I started shaking and...
I don't know. It was weird.
It just felt like an explosion!
But a good one.
Cecile, you had an orgasm.
I did?
You're becoming a woman.
I'm so proud of you.
I am?
Cecile.
Listen.
Now that you're on your way,
it would be stupid to stop.
Think of Sebastian as a tutor.
Let him instruct you.
But I don't love him.
I love Ronald.
So? Don't you wanna
make Ronald happy?
Practice makes perfect.
My advice is to sleep with
as many people as possible.
But that would make me a slut.
Wouldn't it?
Cecile, everybody does it.
It's just that nobody talks about it.
So it's like a secret society.
That's one way of looking at it.
Fucking idiot.
Cool.
Secret society, secret society.
Am I supposed to feel this sore?
For the first time, yes.
It'll pass.
I like it better when I'm on top.
Cecile.
This is what I like
to call "quiet time."
It's when we reflect
on the things we've just done.
Sorry.
Something's the matter?
You think?
Is it me?
No, you were fine.
It's that Annette girl.
You love her, don't you?
It's okay.
I don't love you either.
I love Ronald.
- I'm getting out of here.
- Where are you going?
I'm taking a shower.
- Want any company?
- No.
- Want a blowjob?
- Good night, Cecile.
Prude.
Who are you spying on?
- That her?
- Yeah.
Oh, no, she's crying.
Little baby's upset
by the big, bad book.
Shut up.
What's up your ass?
Nothing.
She's really getting to you,
isn't she?
If you must know, yes.
I don't know what to do.
I can't stand that
"holier than thou" bullshit...
...yet I'm completely
infatuated with her.
She made me laugh.
So that's why you're losing our bet?
I'm not losing our bet.
It's just taking a little longer
than I expected.
Do you mind if I take
my new car for a ride?
Kathryn, the only thing you're
gonna be riding is me.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some work to do.
I'm sorry about that.
I am too.
I'm not sorry.
I don't take it back.
I thought we were just
gonna be friends.
I can't handle it.
I can't keep my feelings
bottled up like you.
Can you honestly tell me
that you feel nothing for me?
Yeah, I have feelings for you.
Then what's wrong?
It's not like you have a husband.
Unless you're married to Jesus.
That's not fair!
Why can't we be together?
You wanna know why?
Yes, I wanna know why.
I don't trust myself with you.
Come in.
Hi.
I just came to say goodbye.
Where are you going?
Back to the city. I may go to the south
of France for the end of the summer.
I can't take your games anymore.
What games?
Come off it.
You're hot one minute,
you're cold the next.
You make me feel inadequate.
If that's how you feel,
then it's best that you leave.
Good for you.
Sebastian, I don't want us
to part on bad terms.
Well, I'm afraid you don't have
a choice in the matter.
You're a hypocrite.
I don't associate with hypocrites.
How am I a hypocrite?
You spend all your time
preaching about "waiting for love."
Well, here it is.
Right in front of you.
And you're gonna
turn your back on it.
So I guess we're just fucked.
I'll move on.
But you will spend
the rest of your life...
...knowing that you've turned
your back on love.
And that makes you a hypocrite.
Have a nice life.
Wait.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Get it together, you pussy.
Morning.
So how'd it go last night?
With who?
I know how it went with Cecile.
She won't shut up about it.
If you're asking if I nailed her,
the answer is no.
She shot you down?
Exactly the opposite.
What went wrong?
I don't know.
She was lying on the bed...
...ready to do it, but I was...
I just didn't feel right about it.
You had the chance to fuck her
and you didn't?
God, are you a chump.
If you're heading to her room,
you won't find her.
- Where is she?
- You don't know?
She left 30 minutes ago.
Where did she go?
She apologized to your aunt
and told her...
...she was gonna stay
with some friends.
You blew it, Sebastian.
That girl's come to her senses.
And she'll never go near you again.
Stupid, stupid, stupid.
Judy. I'll save that.
Hello.
- Greg, it's Valmont.
- Hey, buddy!
- Is she with you?
- No!
- Where is she?
- I don't know.
- Why don't you leave her alone?
- Where is she?
Okay, all right!
She's with her friend's parents,
the Michalaks.
She caught a train
into Penn Station 20 minutes ago.
- Thank you.
- No problem.
I'm impressed.
Well, I'm in love.
Are you okay?
Just a minute.
Come in.
Bad time?
Kind of.
You obviously wanted me
to witness your little adventure...
...or else you wouldn't
have invited me in.
Who is our friend
who gives you such pleasure?
Where could he be?
Hi.
Some fucked-up shit in this house.
Call me.
You don't get to have all the fun.
So I assume you've come here
to make arrangements.
Some other time.
Excuse me?
I'm not in the mood.
I wanna fuck!
And I don't.
Good afternoon, Kathryn.
Sounds great.
I love you too.
"I love you too"?
My God,
you're completely pussy-whipped.
Stop it.
What happened to us?
Nothing has changed.
Yes, it has.
You love her.
You don't love me anymore.
Come on, Kathryn,
it's just a bet.
This is ridiculous.
What's ridiculous,
dear brother, is you.
Look at yourself.
Look what you've been reduced to.
Have you thought about what
will happen when school starts?
You're dating
Miss Seventeen magazine...
...who's also
the new headmaster's daughter.
Before you know it, you'll be giving
campus tours with her.
Wait.
Her father doesn't know
about your past, does he?
I doubt he'd let his little princess
be seen with the likes of you.
It's so disappointing to see
Annette's manifesto was a total sham.
As student body president,
I feel it's my sworn duty to tell him.
Put the phone down.
This will only take a second.
Quite the predicament you're in.
I don't care what you say.
In fact, I was planning on telling her
everything this afternoon.
That's right. I forgot.
You're so in love.
Do you honestly believe...
...you've done a 180
in the few days you've known her?
Well, let me tell you something.
People don't change overnight.
You and I are two of a kind.
At least I have the guts to admit it.
You were gonna
leave school a legend.
Now you're gonna leave a joke.
I'm willing to take my chances.
Don't do it, Sebastian.
You'll not only ruin
your reputation...
...you'll destroy hers.
- Hi.
- Hi.
And this is my room.
Do you think we can be quiet?
There's something I have to tell you.
Tell me.
This isn't working out
for me anymore.
Yeah, me neither.
What's wrong?
It's not you. It's me.
I'm completely fucked up.
What are you saying?
I thought I was in love with you,
but it was just a lie.
I wanted it to work,
but unfortunately, I feel nothing.
Why are you doing this?
I just wanted to see
what you were like in bed.
I know you don't mean that.
You know nothing.
You don't even know me!
The fact of the matter is,
there is someone I love.
You don't even compare to her.
I don't believe you.
I don't know how to make this
any clearer to you.
You mean nothing to me.
You were just...
You were just a conquest.
You're such a coward.
Look at yourself, you're shaking.
Is that what you came to tell me?
I'm sorry. I'm completely...
Yeah, you're completely fucked up!
Get out.
Get out!
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me.
Don't fucking touch me, Sebastian!
Don't!
Just leave.
Jesus.
A little melodramatic,
don't you think?
I thought you'd like to know what
happened between Annette and I.
It's over.
Really?
You were right.
I can't change.
You and I are two of a kind.
I thought we should celebrate.
I'd love to...
...but unfortunately,
I'm expecting company.
Who, Ronald?
Not that it's any of
your business, but yes.
From Ronald.
I haven't had a chance
to read it yet...
...but I'm pretty sure
it goes something like:
"Yada, yada, yada,
you mean a lot to me.
Hope we can still be friends,
et cetera, et cetera."
I expected your bullshit,
so I took the liberty of arranging...
...a little get-together
between Ronald and Cecile.
You were right.
You do get dumped
for the innocent little twits.
Well done.
Thank you.
Now where were we?
Oh, yes, the celebration.
What shall we toast to?
To my triumph.
It's not my choice of toasts,
but it's your call.
To your triumph over Annette.
What's so funny?
Silly rabbit.
My triumph isn't over her.
It's over you.
Come again?
You were very much in love with her.
And you're still in love with her.
But it amused me
to make you ashamed of it.
You gave up on the first person
you ever loved...
...because I threatened
your reputation.
Don't you get it?
You're just a toy, Sebastian.
A little toy I like to play with.
And now you've completely
blown it with her.
I think it's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.
Cheers.
Tastes good.
So I assume you've come here
to make some arrangements.
But unfortunately,
I don't fuck losers.
Goodbye, Sebastian.
It's imperative that I talk to her.
I don't know what to tell you.
She's not here.
Could you please tell her I called?
Of course I will.
- May I help you?
- I need to speak with Annette.
She's not here.
Listen, I'm entertaining guests...
Annette! Annette!
I already told you,
she is not here.
- Please see that she gets this.
- I'll do that.
It's really important.
I understand. Good night.
I'm terribly sorry about that.
You never know who's
gonna show up at my door.
Dear Annette,
I don't know what I can say...
...to rectify the harm
I've caused you.
The truth is, being with you was
the only time I've ever been happy.
My whole life has been a joke.
I prided myself on taking joy
in others' misery.
Well, it finally backfired.
I succeeded in hurting
the first person I loved.
Enclosed is
my most prized possession:
My journal.
For a long time,
I considered it my trophy.
A sordid collection
of my conquests.
If you want to know the truth,
then please read it.
No more lies.
Please give me another chance.
I'm a wreck without you.
- Hello.
- Ronald?
- Yeah?
- It's Kathryn.
What's up?
- Is everything okay?
- No.
It's Sebastian.
He's out of his mind.
- What do you mean?
- He hit me and then he took off.
I'm just afraid to be alone.
Please, I really need you.
Okay, just settle down.
There's more.
It involves Cecile.
Stay there. I'll be right over.
Son of a bitch.
Valmont.
- Hey, Ronald.
- We have some talking to do.
Can we do it later?
I've had a really bad night.
What's your problem?
Where do you come off,
hitting Kathryn?
- Christ, she got to you too.
- She told me everything.
You don't know what
you're talking about.
She told me you fucked Cecile.
It's true, isn't it?
- I'm sorry...
- Motherfucker!
Sebastian.
Sebastian!
Stop it!
- Shit!
- Annette!
Sebastian.
I love you, Annette.
I love you too.
Just hold on.
As the new headmaster
of Manchester Prep...
...it saddens me to start
our new school year...
...with such a mournful tone.
I didn't know anyone else
was in here.
I'm sorry.
- I'm Annette Hargrove.
- Kathryn Merteuil.
Have we met?
I don't think so.
Your father's the new headmaster
at Manchester, right?
That's right.
I was sorry to hear
about your brother.
Are you okay?
I'll be fine.
Did you know Sebastian?
You might say that.
Such a tragedy, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
I'll leave you alone now.
Are you sure you'll be okay?
I'm here if you need a friend.
That's great.
I know it sounds trite, but sometimes
when I feel I can't go on...
...I turn to Jesus
and he helps me through it.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
I'll see you around campus.
Looking forward to it.
Freak.
Here we go.
However dark the cloud...
...there's always a silver lining.
It might be hard to see...
...but what we should learn from this
is to be true to ourselves...
...and to resist
the temptations of peer pressure.
As student body president,
I've tried to set an example in myself.
Unfortunately, the one person
I could not reach out to in time...
...was my stepbrother, Sebastian.
I know he's looking down
on us today and...
I know he's looking down on us today
and he'd want me to say...
He'd want me to say, "Kathryn..."
He'd want me to say,
"Kathryn, I'm sorry."
What is going on?
Don't you people have any respect?
