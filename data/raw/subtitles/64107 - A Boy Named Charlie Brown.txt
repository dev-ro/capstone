 AREN'T THE CLOUDS
 BEAUTIFUL?
 THEY LOOK LIKE
 BIG BALLS OF COTTON.
 I COULD JUST
 LIE HERE ALL DAY
 AND WATCH THEM
 DRIFT BY.
 IF YOU USE
 YOUR IMAGINATION,
 YOU COULD SEE
 LOTS OF THINGS
 IN THE CLOUD
 FORMATIONS.
 WHAT DO YOU THINK
 YOU SEE, LINUS?
WELL, THOSE CLOUDS
UP THERE LOOK TO ME
   LIKE THE MAP OF
   THE BRITISH HONDURAS
   ON THE CARIBBEAN.
THAT CLOUD UP THERE
  LOOKS A LITTLE
  LIKE THE PROFILE
  OF THOMAS EAKINS,
 THE FAMOUS PAINTER
 AND SCULPTOR.
   AND THAT GROUP OF CLOUDS
   OVER THERE
GIVES ME THE IMPRESSION
OF  THE STONING OF STEPHEN.
   I CAN SEE
   THE APOSTLE PAUL
 STANDING THERE
 TO ONE SIDE.
 UH-HUH.
 THAT'S VERY GOOD.
 WHAT DO YOU SEE
 IN THE CLOUDS,
 CHARLIE BROWN?
WELL,
  I WAS GOING TO SAY
  I SAW A DUCKY
AND A HORSY,
BUT I CHANGED MY MIND.
 [tree creaking]
    * LIKE THE SHADOWS
    OF MORNING *
    * CLIMB UP
    TO THE AUGUST AFTERNOON *
  * CHARLIE HAS A WAY 
    * OF PICKING UP THE DAY 
 * JUST BY WALKING SLOWLY
 IN A ROOM *
 * MAYBE IT'S A KIND OF MAGIC 
 * THAT ONLY LITTLE BOYS
 CAN DO *
   * BUT SEEING CHARLIE SMILE 
   * CAN MAKE YOU STOP AWHILE 
    * AND GET YOU FEELING GLAD
    YOU'RE YOU *
 [wind howling]
[kite creaking]
    * HE'S ONLY A BOY
    NAMED CHARLIE *
  * A BOY NAMED CHARLIE BROWN 
  * HE'S JUST A KID NEXT DOOR 
    * PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE 
 * HE'S EVERY KID
 IN EVERY TOWN *
   * THE WORLD IS FULL
   OF LOTS OF PEOPLE *
 * HERE AND THERE
 AND ALL AROUND *
    * BUT PEOPLE, AFTER ALL 
   * START OUT AS BEING SMALL 
  * AND WE'RE ALL A BOY NAMED 
    * CHARLIE BROWN *
 [screeching]
  [screeching]
 I'LL NEVER BE ABLE
 TO GET THIS KITE IN THE AIR.
NEVER! NEVER!
NEVER! NEVER!
   I CAN'T DO IT.
   I CAN'T DO IT.
I DON'T WANT
TO SEE THIS KITE AGAIN
AS LONG AS I LIVE.
   TAKE IT. TAKE IT.
   GET IT OUT OF MY SIGHT!
ANYBODY WHO CAN
FLY THIS KITE
IS A GENIUS.
 (Charlie)
 MY HEART IS FULL
    ON THE DAY I FIRST GO OUT
    TO THE OLD BALL FIELD.
   I LOVE THE MEMORIES.
    I LOVE THE SMELL
    OF THE HORSEHIDE.
  [sniffing]
  I LOVE THE SMELL
  OF THE GRASSY OUTFIELD
  AND THE DUSTY INFIELD.
 THE HOPES AND THE DREAMS
 FOR THE NEW SEASON.
 AH, THERE IT IS,
 THE OLD PITCHER'S MOUND,
  COVERED WITH TRADITION
  AND DANDELIONS.
   DANDELIONS?
THIS PITCHER'S MOUND
IS COVERED WITH DANDELIONS!
  (Frieda)
  DON'T TOUCH THEM,
  CHARLIE BROWN!
   DON'T YOU DARE HURT
   ALL THOSE
   INNOCENT DANDELIONS.
 THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.
 DON'T YOU DARE
 CUT THEM DOWN.
   BESIDES,
   YOU MAY NOT KNOW IT,
  BUT YOU LOOK KIND OF CUTE
  STANDING THERE
  SURROUNDED BY DANDELIONS.
I DON'T WANT TO LOOK CUTE.
  [clattering]
  *[drums rolling]
  *[Star-Spangled Banner
 playing on record player]
 [clattering]
 [spitting]
 ALL RIGHT,
 CHARLIE BROWN,
 LET'S GET
 OUR SIGNALS STRAIGHT.
 1 FINGER WILL MEAN
 THE HIGH STRAIGHT BALL.
 2 FINGERS WILL MEAN
 THE LOW STRAIGHT BALL.
   WHAT ABOUT MY CURVEBALL,
   AND MY SLIDER
   AND MY KNUCKLE BALL,
   AND MY SIDEARM,
AND MY SUBMARINE PITCH?
 1 FINGER WILL MEAN
 THE HIGH STRAIGHT BALL.
 AND 2 FINGERS WILL MEAN
 THE LOW STRAIGHT BALL.
 HEY, WHAT'S THIS?
 WHAT IN THE WORLD
 ARE ALL THESE
 DANDELIONS DOING
 ON THE PITCHER'S MOUND?
THEY GREW THERE
  AND THE GIRLS
  ON OUR TEAM
 WON'T LET ME
 CUT 'EM DOWN.
THEY SAY THEY'RE PRETTY
  AND THEY SAY I LOOK CUTE
  STANDING HERE AMONG THEM.
 THEY'RE RIGHT.
 YOU DO LOOK KIND OF CUTE
 STANDING THERE.
 [grunts]
[grunts]
 CHARLIE BROWN,
  CHARLIE BROWN,
  IT'S TAKING YOU
  TOO LONG
 TO GET DRESSED
 AFTER EVERY PITCH.
 IF YOU CAN'T GET DRESSED
 A LITTLE FASTER,
 WE'LL NEVER GET THROUGH
 THE FIRST INNING.
 (Lucy)
 WAIT.
   HMM.
 BRUSH THIS GUY BACK,
 CHARLIE BROWN.
 GIVE HIM
 THE OLD BEAN BALL.
  NO, I CAN'T DO THAT,
  IT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT.
 "IT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT"?
 LISTEN WHO'S GONE MORAL
 ON US ALL OF A SUDDEN.
  OLD WISHY-WASHY
  HERE IS TOO MORAL
  TO THROW A BEAN BALL.
 WHAT ABOUT THE WAY
 THE EARLY SETTLERS
 TREATED THE INDIANS?
 YEAH AND WHAT ABOUT
 THOSE AWFUL MOVIE ADS?
   WHAT ABOUT
   THE CHILDREN'S CRUSADE?
  WAS THAT MORAL?
 DO YOU THINK
 THAT INCIDENT
 AT HARPER'S FERRY
 WAS CONSISTENT
 WITH MORALITY?
   DO YOU CALL THAT
   MORALITY?
 DEFINE MORALITY.
  OUR WHOLE SYSTEM
  OF FREEWAYS
 IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE
 OF WHAT I'M TRYING
 TO SAY.
   HAVE YOU LISTENED
   TO THE RADIO LATELY?
(Pigpen)
HOW ABOUT THIS WHOLE
CONSERVATION SITUATION?
WE NEVER WIN
ANY BALL GAMES,
 BUT WE SURE HAVE
 SOME INTERESTING DISCUSSIONS.
 [grunts]
 WHAT HAPPENED?
   CHARLIE BROWN
   GOT HIT
   BY A LINE DRIVE.
 DOES ANYONE HERE
 KNOW ANYTHING
 ABOUT FIRST AID?
  IT'S PROBABLY
  NOT SERIOUS,
SECOND OR THIRD AID
WILL DO.
  HERE, RUN OVER TO
  THE DRINKING FOUNTAIN
  AND SOAK
  THIS HANDKERCHIEF
  IN COLD WATER.
YOU'RE KIDDING.
   WITH A HEAD LIKE
   CHARLIE BROWN'S,
   YOU'LL NEED
   A BED SHEET.
 I'M DYING
 AND ALL I HEAR
 ARE INSULTS.
 WHAT HAPPENED?
   YOU GOT HIT
   ON THE HEAD
 WITH A LINE DRIVE,
 CHARLIE BROWN.
  I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
I USED TO BE
ABLE TO DODGE
THOSE LINE DRIVES.
 WHEN YOU GET OLD,
 YOUR REFLEXES
 REALLY SLOW DOWN.
[ball whizzing]
[ball whizzing]
[ball whizzing]
[ball whizzing]
  [yawning]
 [all wailing]
   (Charlie)
   WELL, WE LOST THE FIRST GAME
   OF THE SEASON AGAIN.
 I SHOULDN'T LET IT
 BOTHER ME, BUT IT DOES.
   WE ALWAYS SEEM TO LOSE
   THE FIRST GAME OF THE SEASON
    AND THE LAST GAME
    OF THE SEASON.
 AND ALL THOSE STUPID GAMES
 IN BETWEEN!
    (Charlie)
    IN THE BIG LEAGUES,
   THE BALLPLAYERS
   GET SENT TO THE SHOWERS.
 I GET SENT TO TAKE A BATH.
    NOTHING EVER SEEMS
    TO GO RIGHT FOR ME.
  I CAN'T FLY A KITE
  AND I LOSE
  EVERY BALLGAME I PLAY IN.
  I JUST CAN'T SEEM
  TO DO ANYTHING RIGHT.
 HI, CHARLIE BROWN.
 YOU'RE DEPRESSED,
 AREN'T YOU?
 I SUPPOSE YOU FORGOT
 WE LOST ANOTHER BALL GAME.
   I DID NOT.
 TODAY'S GAME MADE
 OUR 99TH STRAIGHT LOSS
 WITHOUT A WIN.
THAT WASN'T
A VERY GOOD GAME TODAY,
CHARLIE BROWN.
   I KNOW IT.
 I'M GETTING TIRED
 OF LOSING
 ALL THESE BALL GAMES.
 AND THIS WAS GOING
 TO BE OUR BIG YEAR.
 THE YEAR
 WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE
 WE MIGHT EVEN SCORE
 OUR FIRST RUN.
 I THINK
 IT WOULD BE KIND OF FUN
 TO WIN ONCE IN A WHILE.
   WINNING ISN'T
   EVERYTHING.
 BUT LOSING
 ISN'T ANYTHING.
 LOOK AT IT THIS WAY,
 CHARLIE BROWN.
  WE LEARN MORE FROM LOSING
  THAN WE DO FROM WINNING.
 I GUESS THAT MAKES ME
 THE SMARTEST PERSON
 IN THE WHOLE WORLD.
 I THINK YOU JUST
 TALK YOURSELF
 INTO BEING A LOSER,
 CHARLIE BROWN.
I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE
IN THIS BUSINESS
 OF SOME PEOPLE
 BEING BORN LOSERS.
IF YOU KEEP ON
DOING DIFFERENT THINGS,
YOU'RE GOING TO WIN
 JUST AS MUCH
 AS ANYONE ELSE.
 JUST KEEP TRYING,
 CHARLIE BROWN.
  DON'T GIVE UP.
YOU'LL WIN YOUR SHARE
OF BALL GAMES.
I JUST DON'T THINK
IT'S POSSIBLE
   FOR SOMEONE TO LOSE
   EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME.
 ONE OF THESE DAYS,
 YOU'LL WIN.

   WHY CAN'T I HAVE
   AN ORDINARY DOG
   LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE?
 [exclaims]
 (Charlie)
 SOMETIMES I GET
 SO DISCOURAGED
   THAT I CAN HARDLY STAND IT.
    THE HARDER I TRY,
    THE WORSE I GET.
  PERHAPS I SHOULD SEEK
  PROFESSIONAL HELP.
 I THINK I NEED HELP.
  HMM.
 EVERYTHING I DO
 TURNS TO FAILURE.
 I GUESS YOU KNOW
 I'VE NEVER SUCCEEDED
 AT ANYTHING
 IN MY WHOLE LIFE.
  CHARLIE BROWN, IT'S TRUE.
I RECOGNIZE YOUR FRAILTIES,
YOUR WEAKNESSES.
  YOU NEED ME
  TO POINT OUT YOUR FAULTS,
  CHARLIE BROWN.
IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.
 BESIDES, I CAN DO IT
 FOR YOU BETTER THAN
 ANYONE ELSE.
 MY SYSTEM IS UNIQUE.
  WHAT'S SO UNIQUE
  ABOUT IT?
 COME IN AND SIT DOWN,
 CHARLIE BROWN.
 I'LL EXPLAIN
 MY UNIQUE SYSTEM.
   MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME,
   CHARLIE BROWN.
  I'LL SET UP MY EQUIPMENT.
SEE WHAT I'VE DONE?
 I'VE PUT ALL OF
 YOUR FAULTS ON SLIDES.
WE'RE GOING TO
PROJECT YOUR FAULTS
ONTO A SCREEN.
  GOOD GRIEF,
  PROJECT MY FAULTS
  ONTO A SCREEN?
   NOW,
   WATCH CAREFULLY.
   HERE WE SEE YOUR FAILURE
   TO OBSERVE THE WORLD
   IN UPRIGHT POSITION.
  HERE WE SEE YOUR
  LACK OF COORDINATION,
  CHARLIE BROWN.
  [projector clicking]
AND HERE WE SEE
YOUR LACK OF STYLE.
 NOW, ON TO
 YOUR PHYSICAL FAULTS.
THESE SLIDES WILL SHOW
YOUR TENDENCY
TOWARDS FATNESS.
  LOOK AT THAT STOMACH.
 EVEN YOUR NOSE IS FAT,
 AND YOUR LEGS.
   WHY, I'LL BET
   IF THE TRUTH WERE KNOWN,
   EVEN YOUR TOES ARE FAT.
   NOW, WE'RE REALLY GOING
   TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS.
   THE NEXT BATCH OF SLIDES
   WILL SHOW
  YOUR BIGGEST
  AND MOST DAMAGING FAULTS.
 THESE COULD TAKE
 ABOUT AN HOUR TO SHOW.
 [clicking]
  UH...
[stuttering]
NO, NO.
 UGH. TURN IT OFF!
 I CAN'T STAND IT
 ANY LONGER!
 I CAN'T STAND TO WATCH!
 I CAN'T STAND IT!
 I CAN'T STAND IT!
   ONE MOMENT THERE,
   CHARLIE BROWN.
RELAX HERE A WHILE,
CHARLIE BROWN.
  WE'LL SOLVE THIS
  PROBLEM TOGETHER.
  THE WAY I SEE IT,
  YOUR PROBLEM IS
  ONE OF EMOTIONS.
  WHEN YOU HAVE
  EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS,
 IT IS USUALLY BECAUSE
 YOU HAVE NO OUTLETS.
  YOU NEED
  EMOTIONAL OUTLETS.
I NEED
EMOTIONAL OUTLETS.
   WHAT KIND OF
   EMOTIONAL OUTLETS
   WOULD YOU SUGGEST?
  THIS FOOTBALL
  IS A PERFECT ANSWER.
THERE IS NO BETTER
EMOTIONAL OUTLET
THAN KICKING A FOOTBALL.
TO SUM IT ALL UP
IN ONE PHRASE,
CHARLIE BROWN,
   YOU COULD KICK AWAY
   YOUR FAULTS.
   BOY, YOU MUST THINK
   I AM STUPID.
 YOU JUST WANNA
 HOLD THAT FOOTBALL
AND HAVE ME COME RUNNING AT
TO KICK AT IT
SO YOU CAN PULL IT AWAY
AND SEE ME FALL FLAT
ON MY BACK!
 THE CURE IS UP TO YOU,
 CHARLIE BROWN.
 DO YOU WANNA KICK THE HABIT,
 OR DON'T YOU.
 PERHAPS YOU'D RATHER HAVE
 ANOTHER VIEWING SESSION
 OF ALL YOUR FAULTS
 ON THOSE SLIDES.
  ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!
  I'LL TRY IT!
  I'LL TRY IT!
  NO MORE SLIDES!
YOU WON'T
BE DISAPPOINTED,
CHARLIE BROWN.
THIS TIME I HAVE
A LITTLE EXTRA SURPRISE
AS A BONUS.
   WHY, OH,
   WHY DO I LET HER
   DO THIS TO ME?
WHY? WHY?
 MAYBE SHE'S RIGHT.
 AFTER ALL
 IF YOU CAN'T TRUST
 YOUR OWN PSYCHIATRIST,
 WHO CAN YOU TRUST?
  THIS TIME
  I'M REALLY GONNA KICK IT.
  I'M GONNA KICK THE HABIT.
  THIS IS THE END
  OF ALL MY FAULTS.
[screaming]
  AND NOW
  FOR THE SURPRISE.
  WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE
  HOW IT LOOKED
  ON INSTANT REPLAY?
*[humming]
   INSTANT REPLAY?
[continues humming]
 HEAR YOU ARE,
 CHARLIE BROWN.
NOW I'M GOING
TO RUN THROUGH THIS
AT SLOW MOTION.
  [videotape winding]
  I THINK WE MUST
  CAREFULLY ANALYZE
  YOUR EVERY MOVE,
 YOUR EVERY EXPRESSION.
   *[Lucy humming]
SEE HOW ERRATIC
YOUR MOVEMENTS ARE?
 LOOK AT YOUR FACE!
   THOSE BAD PERSONALITY TRAITS
   WE SPOKE ABOUT
 STAND OUT CLEARLY.
  NOW, SEE THE LOOK
  OF DETERMINATION
  ON YOUR FACE.
 OH, SHAM,
 CHARLIE BROWN.
 A FAILURE FACE
 IF I EVER SAW ONE.
IN TURN, SEE HOW BENIGN
 AND COMPOSED
 MY FACE IS,
 CHARLIE BROWN.
   AND YOUR CLUMSINESS,
   CHARLIE BROWN.
 SHALL WE RUN THROUGH IT
 ONCE MORE AT NORMAL SPEED?
   [videotape winding]
   NO.
 NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
  I'VE NEVER GONE THROUGH
  ANYTHING LIKE THAT
  IN MY LIFE.
  I NEVER KNEW
  I COULD BE SO STUPID.
 I NEVER KNEW
 I HAD SO MANY FAULTS.
   I NEVER FELT
   SO COMPLETELY MISERABLE.
WAIT UNTIL YOU GET MY BILL.
 THESE PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENTS
 ARE GOING TO BANKRUPT ME.
 GET UP, LINUS,
 IT'S TIME TO GO TO SCHOOL.
AGAIN?
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN, AGAIN?
   I WENT YESTERDAY.
   MOM'S ALREADY
   MADE YOUR LUNCH.
   [sighing]
   GUESS I MIGHT AS WELL
   GO TO SCHOOL.
 I CAN'T WASTE A GOOD LUNCH.
 DO YOU HAVE TO DRAG
 THAT STUPID BLANKET
 TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY?
 HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
 IF PEOPLE CAME UP
 TO YOU AND SAID:
"YOUR LITTLE BROTHER
DRAGS A BLANKET WITH HIM
WHEREVER HE GOES"?
THIS BLANKET
IS A NECESSITY.
  IT KEEPS ME
  FROM CRACKING UP.
 IT COULD BE REGARDED
 AS A SPIRITUAL TOURNIQUET.
  WITHOUT THIS BLANKET,
  I'D BE NOTHING.
   A SHIP WITHOUT A RUDDER.
  OH, GOOD GRIEF.
[sighing]
(Linus)
HEY, CHARLIE BROWN.
WAIT FOR ME.
 YOU LOOK LIKE
 YOU'VE BEEN TAKING
   SHOCK TREATMENTS
   OR SOMETHING.
  WHAT'S MORE SHOCKING
  THAN SEEING YOUR FAULTS
PROJECTED
ONTO A SCREEN?
 LIFE IS DIFFICULT,
 ISN'T IT,
 CHARLIE BROWN?
  YES, IT IS.
  BUT I'VE DEVELOPED
  A NEW PHILOSOPHY.
   I ONLY DREAD ONE DAY
   AT A TIME.
 I FEEL TERRIBLE.
 YOU CAN'T CONTINUE
 CARRYING ON LIKE THIS,
 CHARLIE BROWN.
  [inaudible]
YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
  YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
  TO WIN AT SOMETHING.
 (Linus)
 SOMETHING THAT WILL RESTORE
 YOUR LOST SELF-CONFIDENCE.
HEY, CHARLIE BROWN!
   THERE'S A SPELLING BEE
   AT SCHOOL TODAY,
   WHY DON'T YOU VOLUNTEER?
 [laughing]
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA,
CHARLIE BROWN.
IF YOU WIN,
   IT'LL SHOW EVERYBODY
   THAT YOU'RE NOT
   A BORN LOSER.
 MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT,
 LINUS.
 MAYBE I SHOULD VOLUNTEER.
  YOU GO OUT
  FOR THE SPELLING BEE?
 [laughing]
CHARLIE BROWN,
YOU'LL JUST MAKE
A FOOL OF YOURSELF.
  BESIDES THAT,
  YOU'RE BOUND TO BE
  A COMPLETE FAILURE.
(girls)
* YOU NEVER DO
ANYTHING RIGHT *
* YOU NEVER PUT ANYTHING
IN ITS PLACE *
 * NO WONDER EVERYONE
 CALLS YOU FAILURE FACE *
 * YOU'RE SO IMPOSSIBLY DUMB 
  * IN HISTORY BOOKS YOUR NAME
  THEY'LL ERASE *
  * OR ELSE
  THEY'RE BOUND TO CALL YOU
  FAILURE FACE *
 * AND IN THE RACE
 TO BE STUPID *
   * YOU'VE SET A BRAND NEW
   KIND OF PACE *
  * WE'D LIKE TO CHRISTEN YOU
  CHARLIE FAILURE FACE *
[girls laughing]
 BY GOLLY, I'LL SHOW 'EM.
  I'LL SHOW 'EM
  THAT I'M GOOD
  AT SOMETHING.
BY GOLLY,
I'LL SHOW 'EM.
  (Charlie)
  MAYBE I WILL ENTER
  THE SPELLING BEE.
  THAT'S THE SORT
  OF THING I NEED
  TO GAIN CONFIDENCE
  AND SELF-ESTEEM.
  I THINK I'LL RAISE MY HAND
  AND VOLUNTEER.
  IT'LL BE GOOD FOR ME.
  I THINK
  I'LL JUST RAISE MY HAND
  AND VOLUNTEER.
 MY HAND WON'T GO UP.
 MY HAND IS SMARTER
 THAN I AM.
   [teacher chattering]
  YES, MA'AM.
 WHAT AM I DOING?
 AM I TALKING TO MYSELF?
 YES, MA'AM.
 I WAS TALKING TO MYSELF
 ABOUT THE SPELLING BEE.
 YES, MA'AM,
 I'D LIKE TO BE
 IN THE SPELLING BEE.
  [whispering]
  PSST, YOU'RE CRAZY,
  DON'T DO IT.
 YOU'LL JUST MAKE
 A FOOL OUT OF YOURSELF.
   I WILL NOT!
   [teacher chattering]
 EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.
 I WAS ANSWERING
 ONE OF MY MANY DETRACTORS.
 (Charlie)
 WELL, HERE I AM
   IN THE FIRST ROUND
   OF THE SPELLING BEE.
 NOBODY THINKS I CAN WIN
 THE CLASS SPELLING BEE,
 BUT I'M GONNA SHOW 'EM.
   I NOT ONLY KNOW
   A LOT OF HARD WORDS,
   BUT I KNOW
   EVERY SPELLING RULE
   IN THE BOOK.
   THE ONLY ONE
   I HAVE TROUBLE
   REMEMBERING IS:
  "I" BEFORE "E"
  EXCEPT AFTER "D."
 OR IS IT "E" BEFORE "I"
 EXCEPT AFTER "G"?
  I'VE GOT TO STAY CALM
  AND NOT GET RATTLED.
  THIS IS MY BIG CHANCE
  TO PROVE TO EVERYONE
 THAT I CAN DO SOMETHING.
 I DON'T CARE
 IF I DON'T ACTUALLY WIN.
   ALL I WANT TO DO IS
   GET PAST
   THE FIRST FEW ROUNDS
    AND MAKE A DECENT SHOWING.
    LET'S SEE NOW,
    HOW DOES THAT
    SPELLING RULE GO?
   HMM.
   I GUESS I REALLY
   DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.
    ALL THE WORDS
    IN THE FIRST ROUND
    OF A SPELLING BEE
 ARE USUALLY QUITE EASY.
   IN A WAY,
   I'D ALMOST LIKE TO START OFF
   WITH A HARD ONE.
 YOU KNOW,
 KIND OF SHAKE UP
 THE OTHER KIDS?
  I FEEL STRANGELY CALM.
 [teacher chattering]
   OH-OH, HERE IT COMES.
   IT'S MY TURN NEXT,
   HERE'S MY FIRST WORD
   OF THE SPELLING BEE.
 [teacher chattering]
 "FAILURE"? YES, MA'AM.
 THAT'S AN EASY ONE.
   BOY, THAT'S ONE WORD
   HE SHOULD KNOW WELL.
FAILURE.
F-A-I-L-U-R-E. FAILURE.
  I DID IT. I DID IT.
 [teacher chattering]
  OH-OH.
    THAT KID HAS AN EASY ONE.
 (child #1)
 NEIGHBOR.
 N-E-I-B-O-R. NEIGHBOR.
 OH-OH.
  HE'S OUT, HE MISSED IT.
  NOW IT'S--
 [teacher chattering]
  THIS KID HAS A REAL EASY ONE.
   HE'LL NEVER MISS IT.
 THEN I'LL GET A HARD ONE
 AND I'LL BE OUT. RATS.
 (child #2)
 CHARITIES. C-H-A-R
 R-T-E-I-S.
 CHARITIES.
  HE MISSED IT. OH-OH.
    I GUESS NOW IT'S UP TO ME.
 IT'S SYDNEY OR THE BUSH.
 [teacher chattering]
   HERE IT IS.
YES, MA'AM,
THE WORD IS "INSECURE"?
   YES, THAT'S A WORD
   I'M WELL ACQUAINTED WITH.
  CAN YOU IMAGINE?
 OF COURSE
 HE KNOWS THAT WORD.
   IT'S HIS TRADEMARK.
   INSECURE.
   I-N-S-E-C-U-R-E. INSECURE.
 [school bell ringing]
  [children shouting]
  BOY, YOU REALLY DID IT,
  CHARLIE BROWN.
   YOU ARE GREAT.
 YOU'RE OUR CLASS CHAMPION.
  YOU DIDN'T THINK
  I COULD DO IT,
  DID YOU?
BUT I DID IT.
  AND TOMORROW
  YOU'LL REPRESENT
  OUR CLASS
  IN THE ALL-SCHOOL
  SPELLING BEE.
  I'M GOING HOME
  AND REALLY BEAR DOWN.
 (Charlie)
 I'M GOING TO STUDY
 THE WHOLE DICTIONARY.
 THIS IS ONE OF THE RULES
 I MUST REMEMBER.
"'I' BEFORE 'E'
EXCEPT AFTER 'C'
 "OR WHEN SOUNDED LIKE 'A'
 LIKE IN NEIGHBOR OR WAY.
 "WORDS ENDING IN 'I', 'E,'
  "DROP THE 'E'
  AND CHANGE THE 'I'
 TO 'Y' BEFORE ADDING 'ING.'"
   "'I' BEFORE 'E'
   EXCEPT AFTER 'C.'"
LET'S SEE. "I" BEFORE "E"
EXCEPT AFTER "H."
   NO, "I" AFTER "E"
   AFTER "C."
"I" BEFORE "E" AFTER...
   NO, "E" BEFORE "I"
   AFTER "C."
"WHEN A WORD HAS
A 'C' FOR AN ENDING
LIKE 'FROLIC'"
 OR "COLIC"?
  ..."OR 'COMIC' AND
  'MIMIC' AND 'PICNIC',
   YOU ALWAYS ADD A 'K'
   BEFORE APPENDING."
HUH?
 YOU KNOW, STICKING
 AN "E" FOR "I" OR "Y."
 OH, SURE.
  "FOR EXAMPLE,
  COLICKY, FROLICKER,
  PICNICKER, MIMICKER."
AND HICKORY, DICKORY,
DOCKER.
 ON THE OTHER HAND,
"IF SOFTNESS
IS MAINTAINED,"
PAGE 43,
   "THEN 'E' MUST BE
   RETAINED AFTER 'C.'"
 YOU MEAN BEFORE
 THE ENDING "ABLE"?
   RIGHT, THAT KEEPS
   THE SPELLING STABLE.
 SO THAT'S WHY.
 OF COURSE,
 LET'S TRY.
 (both)
 "NOTICEABLE, SERVICEABLE,
 EMBRACEABLE, REPLACEABLE,
 PEACEABLE, ENFORCEABLE,
 PRONOUNCEABLE, AND TRACEABLE."
   "SLEIGH, STEIN,
   FAHRENHEIT."
 "EXCEPTING FIERY,
 HIERARCHY, HIEROGLYPHIC."
  (both)
  "'E-I' IS ALSO USED
  IN SPECIAL WORDS
 THAT MERIT CAREFUL STUDY."
   "E" BEFORE "I" AFTER "C."
  "SEIZURE, LEISURE."
"SEIZE, STEIN, PROTEIN.
WEIRD, EITHER, NEITHER,
CODEINE, CAFFEINE."
 "'SIEGE,' HOWEVER,
 IS SPELLED 'I-E.'"
 (both)
 "OTHERWISE USE 'I-E' IN THIEF,
"BELIEVE, FIEND, NIECE,
FIELD, BRIEF, GRIEF
   CASHIER, ACHIEVE, YIELD."
 "ONLY ONE WORD
 IN THE LANGUAGE
 ENDS IN 'S-E-D-E'
 "'SUPERSEDE'.
 "3 OTHERS END
 IN 'C-E-E-D'
 EXCEED, PROCEED,
 SUCCEED."
 "ALL OTHERS END
 IN 'C-E-D-E.'
 "ACCEDE, CONCEDE,
 INTERCEDE, PRECEDE,
 RECEDE, SECEDE.
  (Linus)
  "E" BEFORE "I" AFTER "C."
    (Charlie)
    WHEN A WORD ENDS IN "C"
  LIKE "FROLIC"
  AND "PICNIC"
  AND "MIMIC"
    INSERT A "K"
    BEFORE ADDING A SUFFIX.
   (both)
   BEGINNING WITH
   "F," "I" OR "Y,"
   "E-I" IS USED IMMEDIATELY
   AFTER THE LETTER "C."
   THE SINGLE EXCEPTION
   IS "FINANCIER."
  "E-I" IS USED IN WORDS
  IN WHICH IT HAS
  THE SOUND OF "A."
   OR THE SOUND OF "I"
   AS IN HEIGHT,
    SLEIGH, STEIN, FAHRENHEIT.
   "E-I" IS ALSO USED
   IN SPECIAL WORDS.
LEISURE, SEIZURE,
SEIZE, SHEIK, PROTEIN."
"WEIRD, EITHER, NEITHER,
CODEINE, CAFFEINE."
  USE "I-E" IN
 THIEF, BELIEVE, FIEND, FIELD,
 BRIEF, GRIEF,
YIELD, ACHIEVE, CASHIER.
 EXCEPT AFTER "C"
 AS IN EXCEED, PROCEED,
SUCCEED, ACCEDE,
CONCEDE, INTERCEDE,
PRECEDE, RECEDE, SECEDE.
  (Charlie)
  "I" BEFORE "E"
  EXCEPT AFTER "C."
   LET'S SEE, BEFORE "C"...
   UH...
 [teacher chattering]
 DISSOLVE. D-I-S-O-L-V-E.
   DISSOLVE.
  THAT STUPID
  CHARLIE BROWN.
 HE'S GONNA GET IT
 THIS TIME.
  HE'S UP AGAINST
  SOME OF THE BEST SPELLERS
  IN THE SCHOOL.
   (child #1)
   ABRASIVE.
 A-S-B
  R-A-S-S-I-V.
   ABRASIVE.
 [teacher chattering]
STOMACH? OH, STOMACH-ACHE.
THAT'S AN EASY ONE.
  STOMACH-ACHE.
  S-T-O-M-A-C-H HYPHEN A-C-H-E.
   STOMACH-ACHE.
 [teacher chattering]
 PHEW.
 EMBARRASSMENT.
E-M-B-A-R-A-S-S
   M-M-E-N-T.
 EMBARRASSMENT.
  (Charlie)
  HE MISSED IT. BOY.
   HERE IS MY TURN.
 [teacher chattering]
  THE WORD IS "PERCEIVE."
  YES, I KNOW THE WORD.
  "I" BEFORE "E"
  EXCEPT AFTER "V."
   OH, BOY, THAT BLOCKHEAD

 HE'S OUR HERO!
 CHARLIE BROWN DID IT!

   * CHAMPION CHARLIE BROWN 
   * THAT HAS A LOVELY RING

  A 4-COLUMN HEADLINE *

  * CHAMPION CHARLIE BROWN *
I HATE TO ADMIT IT,
BUT THIS COULD MEAN
THE START OF
SOMETHING GREAT
 FOR CHARLIE BROWN.
   HE MAY HAVE
   TO GET AN AGENT.
   OF COURSE
   HE'LL NEED AN AGENT.
   OUR GLORIOUS VICTORY
   MUST BE CAPITALIZED UPON.
  LET'S SEE, AS AGENT,
  I SHALL GET 10%,
 OR IS IT 15%
 OF CHARLIE BROWN?
  PERHAPS THIS CALLS
  FOR INCORPORATION.
LUCY VAN PELT, INC.
HMM.
 I GUESS YOU REALLY
 HAVE TO START BONING UP
 ON YOUR SPELLING,
 CHARLIE BROWN.
  BONING UP?
  WHAT FOR? I JUST WON.
   BOY, I WOULDN'T GO
   THROUGH THAT AGAIN
   FOR ANYTHING.
 WHAT? WHAT?
  WHAT?
   I GUESS I SHOWED 'EM.
  I GUESS
  OLD CHARLIE BROWN
  CAME THROUGH.
   PHEW.
  WHAT A RELIEF
  THAT'S OVER.
WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, OVER?
 IT'S OVER. I WON.
 AND I WON'T EVER HAVE
 TO GO THROUGH
 SUCH AN ORDEAL AGAIN.
WHY, YOU BLOCKHEAD,
THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING.
 OF COURSE,
 CHARLIE BROWN.
 THIS IS ONLY
 THE BEGINNING.
 SURE, CHARLIE BROWN,
 THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING.
  [growling]
   CHARLIE BROWN,
   THIS VICTORY MAKES YOU
   OUR REPRESENTATIVE
 TO THE NATIONAL
 ELIMINATION SPELLING BEE,
 2ND GRADE.
  NATIONAL!
  ELIMINATIONS!
  SPELLING BEE!
 UGH!
  WELL, I CAN SEE THAT
  THIS BLOCKHEAD NEEDS HELP.
  IT ISN'T JUST
  THE NATIONALS.
 THERE'S PERSONAL APPEARANCES
 AFTER THAT.
  TESTIMONIALS.
 PERHAPS T.V. APPEARANCES.
 A MANAGER OF MY CALIBER
 IS THE ANSWER, CHARLIE BROWN.
 IN FACT,
 I'M NOT SURE
  IF 15% IS ENOUGH.
   MY VALUABLE PRESENCE
   IS EASILY WORTH 20%.
   GOOD GRIEF.
THE FIRST THING
WE MUST CORRECT
IS YOUR POSTURE.
 JUDGES OF A CONTEST
 CAN BE INFLUENCED
 BY POOR POSTURE.
 YOUR GROOMING
 IS VERY IMPORTANT.
LET'S SPRUCE UP
THESE CLOTHES,
CHARLIE BROWN.
   YOU NEED A HAIRCUT, TOO.
I CAN SEE THAT
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO WORK WITH YOU.
   PATTY,
   WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WELL, WE SHOULD
CHECK HIS WALK.
  IF HE'S GOING
  TO STUMBLE AROUND
  LIKE HE USUALLY DOES.
 WALK,
 CHARLIE BROWN!
   NOT TOO BAD.
  A LITTLE COACHING
  WILL HELP THOUGH.
 TOO BAD HE DOESN'T HAVE
 NATURALLY CURLY HAIR.
 JUDGES CAN'T RESIST
 NATURALLY CURLY HAIR.
  YOU'VE GOTTA LEARN
  HOW TO SMILE,
  CHARLIE BROWN.
   SMILE!
HMM.
HMM.
  YOU'VE GOT A SMILE
  LIKE A SICK PUMPKIN.
   AND FURTHERMORE,
   YOU HAVE TO BE
   UNDERSTOOD.
THE JUDGES MUST BE ABLE
TO UNDERSTAND YOU!
  YOUR DICTION
  MUST BE PERFECT!
   THE HONOR OF YOUR SCHOOL,
   YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD
   RESTS ON YOUR SHOULDERS.
   NOT TO MENTION
   THE ECONOMIC FUTURE
   OF YOUR MANAGER.
 LINUS, I DON'T KNOW
 HOW I GET INTO THESE MESSES.
 IF I HADN'T VOLUNTEERED
 IN THE FIRST PLACE,
 I WOULDN'T HAVE WON
 AND NOW I WOULDN'T
 HAVE TO BE TRYING
 TO MEMORIZE THE DICTIONARY.
 THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
 THAT INSTEAD OF BEING A HERO,
 I'LL MAKE
 A BIGGER FOOL OF MYSELF
 THAN EVER.
  DON'T BE DISCOURAGED,
  CHARLIE BROWN,
   YOU HAVE
   NOTHING TO LOSE.
   YOU'LL EITHER BE A HERO,
   OR A GOAT.
  [mimicking goat bleating]
   HI, BIG BROTHER.
   HI, LINUS.
  HI.
HI, SALLY.
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE ME TO A MOVIE?
 HOW WOULD I EVER
 TAKE YOU TO A MOVIE?
WELL, THIS HAPPENS
ALL THE TIME.
   BOYS CALL UP GIRLS
   AND SAY,
   "WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO
   TO A MOVIE?"
  AND THEN THE GIRLS SAY,
 "WHY, YES,
 I'D LIKE IT VERY MUCH."
AND THEN THE BOY
GOES OVER
TO THE GIRL'S HOUSE
 AND KNOCKS ON THE DOOR
   AND HE SAYS TO HER,
   "I'VE COME
   TO TAKE YOU TO A MOVIE."
  HAVE YOU COME
  TO TAKE ME
  TO A MOVIE, LINUS?
  GOOD GRIEF, NO.
  ISN'T HE
  THE CUTEST THING?
 [children cheering]
 (children)
 C-H-A-R-L-I-E!
 CHARLIE!
 CHARLIE BROWN!
 YEAH!
  THIS WHOLE THING
  MAKES ME FEEL LIKE
  I'M BEING DRAFTED.
  THINK OF IT THIS WAY,
  CHARLIE BROWN,
  YOU'RE GOING ON
  A GREAT ADVENTURE.
   AND YOU'LL BE REPRESENTING
   ALL US LITTLE KIDS.
OUR HONOR IS RIDING
ON YOUR SHOULDERS.
 NOT TO MENTION MY FUTURE
 ECONOMIC SECURITY,
 CHARLIE BROWN.
 AS YOUR AGENT,
 I EXPECT NOTHING BUT SUCCESS
 IN OUR ENDEAVORS.
 GO OUT THERE,
 CHARLIE BROWN, AND FIGHT!
   GOOD GRIEF.
OK, CHARLIE BROWN,
I GUESS
YOU'D BETTER GET ABOARD
  THE BUS IS
  ABOUT TO GO.
 INCIDENTALLY, CHARLIE BROWN,
 I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS.
  MY BLANKET.
  MY LIFE. MY ALL.
 IT WILL BRING YOU LUCK.
   GEE, LINUS.
   THAT'S VERY NICE
   OF YOU.
 HERE.
   I DON'T THINK I--
   HERE.
 WELL, OK.
  THANKS, LINUS.
 HERE!
SO LONG, LINUS.
HERE!
   (children)
   RETURN VICTORIOUS,
   CHARLIE BROWN!
 (Lucy)
 OR DON'T COME BACK
 AT ALL.
 YOU CAN DO IT,
 CHARLIE BROWN!
 YOU CAN DO IT,
 CHARLIE BROWN!
   RETURN VICTORIOUS,
   CHARLIE BROWN.
  *[playing]
SCHROEDER, DO YOU THINK
CHARLIE BROWN WILL WIN?
 DO YOU THINK
 THAT CHARLIE BROWN
 HAS A CHANCE?
 WELL, HE'S BEEN
 PRACTICING A LOT.
 I THINK
 HE HAS A GOOD CHANCE.
   THE YOUNG MAN THESE DAYS
   HAS TO PRACTICE A LOT,
   DOESN'T HE?
 A YOUNG MAN THESE DAYS
 HAS TO WORK VERY HARD
 TO BE ABLE
 TO SUPPORT A WIFE,
 DOESN'T HE?
 WHO SAID ANYTHING
 ABOUT A WIFE?
   DO PIANO PLAYERS
   MAKE A LOT OF MONEY,
   SCHROEDER?
  SOME DO.
 IF THEY PRACTICE
 VERY HARD, I GUESS.
KEEP PRACTICING, KIDDO.
 INCIDENTALLY,
 WHO IS THIS?
GEORGE WASHINGTON?
 WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
  WELL?
I CAN'T HELP IT.
   I MADE THE MISTAKE
   OF GIVING MY BLANKET
   TO CHARLIE BROWN
   TO TAKE TO THAT SPELLING BEE
   FOR GOOD LUCK.
  NOW, I KEEP FAINTING.
  I KEEP PASSING OUT.
WHY DON'T YOU
GO OUTSIDE
  AND GET A BREATH
  OF FRESH AIR?
  [gasping]
  OH.
   [whimpering]
WOE IS ME. I'M DYING.
MY RACE IS RUN.
  WHY DID I LET CHARLIE BROWN
  TAKE MY BLANKET?
   I'VE GOT TO GET
   MY BLANKET BACK.
[panting]
   [moaning]
 SEE, I'M ALWAYS PASSING OUT.
  SNOOPY,
  IT'S UP TO YOU
  TO HELP ME.
  I JUST GOTTA HAVE
  MY BLANKET BACK.
 I GOTTA HAVE MY BLANKET.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME.
  MAYBE YOU CAN COME WITH ME
  TO FIND CHARLIE BROWN
   AND GET MY BLANKET BACK.
*[playing]
[horns honking]
   DISGRACE.
  D-I-S-G-R-A-C-E.
  DISGRACE.
IN CHOOSING BETWEEN
"I-E" AND "E-I"
   "E-I" IS USED
   AFTER THE LETTER "C."
THIS IS TOO MUCH.
  I'M SO TIRED I CAN
  HARDLY STAY AWAKE.
MAYBE I'D BETTER GO TO BED.
BUT IF I GIVE UP NOW,
THE KIDS WILL
NEVER FORGIVE ME.
 I CAN'T KEEP UP THIS PACE.
 MAYBE I SHOULD
 JUST TELL 'EM ALL
THAT MY HEALTH
IS MORE IMPORTANT.
   [inaudible]
   YES, HEALTH.
   H-E-A-L-T-H. HEALTH.
 I'M GETTING DELIRIOUS.
 I BETTER GET A HOLD ON MYSELF.
   I NEED SOMETHING
   IN MY STOMACH.
 STOMACH. S-T-O-M-A-C-H.
 STOMACH.
 I'D BETTER CALL ROOM SERVICE.
  SERVICE.
  S-E-R-V-I-C-E.
  SERVICE.
  YES, SERVICE.
  YES, THAT'S IT.
  "I" BEFORE "E"
  SAVE AFTER "D."
HELLO, YES, HELLO.
OH, DID I RING?
   YES, I GUESS I RANG.
  RANG. R-A-N-G. RANG.
  WHAT?
  OH, YES, ROOM SERVICE.
  I WANT ROOM SERVICE. OOH.
 COULD YOU PLEASE
 SEND ME A BOWL OF DRY CEREAL
 AND A GLASS OF MILK?
 LISTEN, WHAT WAS IT?
 "I" BEFORE "E" AFTER MILK?
[knocking on door]
  THUMP. T-H-U-M-P. THUMP.
   [knocking on door]
 HEY.
   HEY.
  [coughing]
 MY BLANKET, CHARLIE BROWN.
 MY BLANKET.
 I CAN'T BE WITHOUT IT.
 AFTER I GAVE YOU MY BLANKET,
 MY LIFE HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE.
PHEW.
 SEE? I KEEP PASSING OUT.
I CAN'T BE
WITHOUT MY BLANKET.
  [coughing]
  I NEED MY BLANKET,
  CHARLIE BROWN.
  GEE, LINUS, I DON'T KNOW
  WHAT'S WITH YOUR BLANKET.
 I'VE BEEN SO BUSY
 STUDYING
THAT I FORGOT
ALL ABOUT YOUR BLANKET.
   FORGOT ABOUT
   MY BLANKET!
   PHEW.
  WOE, WOE, WOE IS ME.
 GEE, I'M SORRY, LINUS.
  I REALLY HAVE
  BEEN STUDYING SO HARD
  I MUST HAVE MISPLACED IT.
 MAYBE I LEFT IT
 IN THE LOBBY. HMM.
   [groaning]
  NO, I THINK I LEFT IT
  AT THE LIBRARY.
I REALLY
HAVEN'T GONE ANY PLACE
EXCEPT FOR THE LIBRARY.
THAT'S IT. I MUST HAVE
LEFT IT AT THE LIBRARY.
 LIBRARY!
 I GIVE HIM A GOOD LUCK CHARM,
 MY BEAUTIFUL BLANKET,
  AND HE THINKS
  IT'S AT THE LIBRARY.
 CHARLIE BROWN,
 I OUGHT TO KICK YOU!
  [yawning]
  LINUS! LINUS!
  SPEAK TO ME.
   I'M SURE THE BLANKET
   IS AT THE LIBRARY.
 TAKE OLD SNOOPY
 WITH YOU.
HE'S A HUNTING DOG.
HE'LL...
GOOD GRIEF.
  [moaning]
   WELL, HE'LL BE HAPPY
   TO HELP YOU
   FIND YOUR BLANKET.
 I HAVE TO STAY
 AND STUDY.
TOMORROW'S THE SPELLING BEE
AND I JUST HAVE TO STUDY.
  LOOK IN THE HOTEL
  LOBBY FIRST,
   THEN GO DOWN 2 BLOCKS,
   RIGHT, THEN STRAIGHT.
   YOU CAN'T MISS IT.
   IT'S EITHER AT THE LIBRARY
   OR SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY.
IT ISN'T HERE.
 [groans]
IT ISN'T HERE!
   IT ISN'T HERE!
  [groans]
 WHERE IS IT? WHERE CAN IT BE?
  [mumbling]
   [mumbling]
  [whistling]
   [yawning]
(Linus)
WHERE IS IT?
I DON'T SEE IT.
   IT ISN'T HERE.
 IT'S GONE.
 MY POOR BLANKET IS GONE.
 WOE IS ME. I'M SUNK.
  THAT SCOUNDREL,
  CHARLIE BROWN,
  LOST MY BLANKET.
 ALL RIGHT,
 YOU STUPID BEAGLE,
 SNAP TO IT!
 YOU'VE BEEN NO HELP AT ALL
 IN FINDING MY BLANKET.
  SOME HUNTING DOG!
 THE WORLD IS ENDING
 AND HE CAN'T EVEN
 HELP FIND A BLANKET.
   IT'S THAT BLOCKHEAD
   CHARLIE BROWN'S FAULT.
IF I HADN'T
FELT SORRY FOR HIM,
   THIS WOULD
   NEVER HAVE HAPPENED.
NEVER FEEL SORRY
FOR BLOCKHEADS!
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE
THAT CHARLIE BROWN.
 [banging on door]
  GOOD MORNING, LINUS
  AND SNOOPY.
   SNOOPY, S-N-O-O-P-Y. SNOOPY.
   WELL, CHARLIE BROWN,
   YOU REALLY DID IT.
[yawns]
  WE LOOKED FOR THAT BLANKET
  ALL OVER THE CITY.
 AND AS FOR THIS
 HUNTING DOG OF YOURS,
 HE'S COMPLETELY USELESS.
 USELESS.
 U-S-E-L-E-S-S. USELESS.
 GEE, I'M SORRY, LINUS.
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
S-A-Y. SAY.
 I'VE GOT TO GET READY
 FOR THE CONTEST.
 CONTEST.
 C-O-N-T-E-S-T. CONTEST.
  I'LL NEVER SEE
  MY BLANKET AGAIN.
   WASHING.
   W-A-S-H-I-N-G. WASHING.

  I'M A FRIEND OF ONE

 I'M SURE CHARLIE BROWN
 WILL PERFORM COMMENDABLY.
   IT'S GONNA START.
   HERE IT IS.
 IT'S SYDNEY OR THE BUSH
 FOR CHARLIE BROWN.
   [whistles]
   WHEN A WORD ENDS IN "C,"
   A "K" IS ADDED

 LET'S GO HOME.
 SO LONG, CHARLIE BROWN.
 SEE YOU TOMORROW.
  [yawning]
 OH, HI, LINUS.
 DID YOU COME
 TO TAKE ME TO A MOVIE?
 THERE'S ONE DOWNTOWN,
 FOR MATURE AUDIENCES ONLY.
  GOOD GRIEF, NO.
  I CAME TO SEE CHARLIE BROWN.
  IS HE HERE?
 YES, HE'S IN HIS ROOM.
 HE'S BEEN IN BED ALL DAY
 AND HAS THE SHADES
 PULLED DOWN.
WELL, IF YOU DECIDE
YOU WANT TO
TAKE ME TO A MOVIE,
  YOU HAVE MY PHONE NUMBER.
 (Charlie Brown)
 WHO IS IT?
   IT'S ME, LINUS.
   MAY I COME IN?
 I DON'T CARE.
   IT'S DARK IN HERE.
   I CAN'T SEE A THING.
YOU MIND IF I
PULL THE SHADES UP?
 (Charlie Brown)
 I DON'T CARE.
   YOU WEREN'T IN SCHOOL TODAY,
   CHARLIE BROWN.
   ALL THE KIDS MISSED YOU.
   I'M NEVER GOING
   TO SCHOOL AGAIN
   AS LONG AS I LIVE.
  WE HAD A BALLGAME
  AFTER SCHOOL.
 I DON'T CARE.
 I'M NEVER GOING TO
 PLAY BALL EITHER.
 I'M NEVER GOING TO DO
 ANYTHING AGAIN.
 IT'S THE FIRST GAME
 WE'VE WON ALL SEASON.
OH, BROTHER.
 WELL, I CAN UNDERSTAND
 HOW YOU FEEL.
 YOU WORKED HARD
 STUDYING FOR THE SPELLING BEE,
AND I SUPPOSE YOU FEEL
YOU LET EVERYONE DOWN
  AND YOU MADE
  A FOOL OF YOURSELF
  AND EVERYTHING.
  BUT,
  DID YOU NOTICE SOMETHING,
  CHARLIE BROWN?
  WHAT'S THAT?
THE WORLD DIDN'T
COME TO AN END.
    * NOW THE SHADOWS
    OF THE MORNING *
  * HAVE GONE BEYOND
