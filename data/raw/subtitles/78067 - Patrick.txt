What happened to that lunatic
son of yours anyway?
- Oh Patrick's somewhere.
And he's not a lunatic.
He's actually smart, almost.
Patrick?
- Jesus Patrick!
Your mother!
- Hello.
How'd you get my number?
Yes I was in bed.
It's none of your business.
I'm gonna hang up now Ed.
I'm gonna hang up right now.
Could you tell me what
Matron Cassidy is please?
Yes?
- I have the applicant with me doctor.
Be with you in a minute.
- Your last letter of
recommendation is dated
three and a half years ago.
You haven't worked as a
Nursing Sister since then?
- No, I stopped when I got married.
- And you haven't worked as
Nursing Sister in this country?
No.
- Could you handle some
typing from time to time?
- Yes.
Any children?
- No.
- And Mr. Jacquard approves of your
returning to shift work?
- Um, we're separated.
- I see.
Why?
Oh it is none of my
business Mrs. Jacquard,
but let's be frank,
we are not interested
in restless housewives
who resign at first
threat of a soiled bedpan.
- I--
- Why did you choose the Roget Clinic
for your come back Mrs. Jacquard?
- The agency suggested--
- Because we are only a small clinic
some applicants presume that
our standards are less rigid.
- Oh I didn't think that.
- And because of this
misconception we tend to attract
certain types.
- Types?
- Types Mrs. Jacquard.
- I don't--
- Lesbians, nymphomaniacs,
enema specialists.
Oh, am I offending you Mrs. Jacquard?
- No.
- Zoophiliacs, Anglophiliacs,
Necrophiliacs,
pedophiliacs, scatophiliacs,
exhibitionists, voyeurs.
Now do you follow me Mrs. Jacquard?
- Yes.
- Disease, like God, moves in
mysterious ways Mrs. Jacquard.
It can don the mask of
perversion and spread
like cancer through a hospital staff.
We had a classic in here last week
seated where you are now.
Applying for work as an orderly
and his little quirk as it turned out
was to sneak down to
the laundry of the night
and paint himself with excreta.
Does that shock you Mrs. Jacquard?
- No.
- Well it should.
It shocks me.
- I can assure you I--
- Oh so did he Mrs. Jacquard.
Oh come in doctor.
Mrs. Jacquard, Dr. Roget.
Matron have
my frogs arrived yet?
No, not yet.
- Could you chase it up?
- Yes, I'll make a note of it.
Mrs. Jacquard's
qualifications are adequate,
but she hasn't worked
in this country before.
- You've worked with
unconscious patients I assume?
- Yes.
Any experience with cerebral monitoring,
EEG's, Fourier analysis?
- A little.
- She comes to us in
the wake of an unstable
domestic situation doctor.
- Hire her.
- Dr. Roget owns this hospital,
which gives him the
privilege to have final say
in borderline cases.
But let me make it very
clear to you Mrs. Jacquard,
I am boss cocky in this hospital.
The salary is minimum,
the hours abominable.
And I should insist on the option to
terminate you without notice.
- Yes that's fine.
- When can you begin?
- Well today if you'd like.
- Yes Matron?
- Oh this is Sister
Jacquard, Sister Williams.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- I'd like you to find her uniform
and then have her relieve
Nurse Panicale in room 15.
- Room 15 Matron?
- That's right.
- You'll be specialing him.
Responsible for IV therapy, monitoring,
and general nursing care.
My god it's like a meat cooler in here,
you'll give him pneumonia.
Sister Jacquard, Nurse Panicale.
Sister Jacquard will be taking over
the noon til nine shift
so you can resume your
regular duties on ward one.
- Thank you sister.
- And this is our friend Patrick.
He's what you call an acute.
- Why haven't his eyes been sutured shut?
- Roget's instructions.
You will be expected to keep the eyes
bathed and lubricated.
- Hello Patrick.
- He can't hear you, he's dead.
Oh technically he's
alive in that he breathes
and pumps blood, but I don't think you're
gonna get much conversation out of him.
He's been unconscious for three years.
- What a waste.
- Oh it's a waste of space if you ask me.
Most of our new sisters
called Patrick first up.
Matron says if he can survive
three years in a coma,
he can live through anything.
Any way, such as he is
he's all yours Sister.
I think you'll find him a handful.
- Well I think Patrick and
I are gonna get along just--
- Oh, that's another thing.
Dr. Roget calls it a motor nerve reflex,
but no one really knows why he does it.
- He seemed to do it on purpose.
- Well one thing's for certain,
Patrick never does anything on purpose.
- Any chance of improvement?
- Nope.
He's been unconscious too long.
Dr. Roget says that even if
he regained consciousness
he would have the intelligence
of a penicillin culture.
But he spits well.
Matron Cassidy's usually in
her office till about eight,
and Dr. Roget often works later.
Otherwise the desk clerk
will sign you off at nine.
Any questions?
- No, I think I can manage.
- Then I'll leave you to it.
- And how's our creature
from the Id this afternoon?
- No change doctor.
- No change, that's good.
Has he moved his bowels yet?
- Not yet.
- You'll let me know when he does.
Jacquard isn't it?
- Yes doctor.
- He spits you know.
And what is your learned
pronouncement Sister?
- I like him.
- Come in, come in.
- Your frogs have arrived doctor.
- Good, good.
Put them down.
See that?
- Sir?
She doesn't like coming in here.
- Why?
- I don't know.
She says there's no
air, flowers won't grow.
Notice anything?
- No.
- Neither does he.
Look at him.
Does he look as though he's been
unconscious for three years?
Actually, he's in better shape now
than when they brought him here.
No wasting.
- What did you call him?
Something from the Id.
- A devil, a born devil
on whose nature nurture can never stick.
- What happened to him?
- Massive damage to the cerebral cortex.
Some accident, so the police said.
- The police were involved?
- Apparently.
- Do you think it could
have been the shock
of seeing his mother killed?
- Who told you that?
- Sister Williams told me.
- Perhaps.
- I mean do you think something like that
could cause this?
- I'm not interested
in amateur psychology.
I'm only interested in what he is now.
Hold the leg please.
- Is he ever aware of anything?
- Captain Fraser says that
he and Patrick play chess.
Captain Fraser also
says that Patrick flies
in and out the window at
night when everyone's asleep.
- How can you be so sure he isn't aware?
- 160 pounds of limp meat hanging off a
comatose brain, can you imagine anything
less aware than that?
- Then why does he spit?
- Here.
I'm inserting the needle
into the base of the skull.
Now I'm destroying the brain cells.
Now I'm going down the spinal column.
Hold out your hand.
And now with this electric stimulator,
in layman's terms, this is why he spits.
See?
Come come sister, we're not going all
watery at the knees over a frog are we?
They gave him all the tests at Lockhart,
wrote him up in a medical journal.
Tried monitoring him 24 hours a day
on an electroencephalograph.
An EEG will pick up any brain activity
from a fart to a nervous breakdown.
1120 hours they had him on it
and what do you think it registered?
Just farts.
- Why don't you let him die?
- He's dead already.
The machines alive.
- Then why don't you switch it off?
- I suppose there's every
reason why we should.
He hasn't a family, no
one comes to see him,
he takes up space, he
wastes the taxpayers money,
he ties up this expensive
equipment 24 hours a day.
- But what's your personal opinion doctor?
- I am a physician governed by a code,
I don't need an opinion.
- I don't think that's a very
satisfactory answer doctor.
- Then you shouldn't ask
unsatisfactory questions Sister.
Do you really want to
know why we keep this
miserable creature alive?
Why he wastes thousands of
dollars worth of equipment
and two nurses of his own?
- Is there a reason?
- Of course there's a reason.
Determining the exact moment of death
is one of the most controversial
issues in modern medicine.
At what point does the,
whatever it is that keeps
a person alive actually leave the body?
- You mean the soul?
- Christians call it the soul,
Russians call it bio plasm,
yogis call it the life force.
But my point is, that whatever it is
has never been identified, why?
Because deaths occurs too quickly.
Dying may occur slowly,
but the moment of death
is like the blink of an eye.
You're either alive or you're dead.
- So Patrick is just a guinea pig to you?
- No, Patrick my dear girl is a very very
rare opportunity to study this display
area between life and death.
- What does Matron Cassidy
think of your ideas?
- She thinks they're bullshit.
Let me know when his bowels have moved.
- Well what does he know anyway?
You probably just haven't
had anything to say, right?
Hello.
Is anybody in there?
Hello?
Hello?
Have you finished Ed?
I'd like to discuss our divorce.
- Divorce?
I thought you said it was
going to be a trial separation?
- Well it's hardly a separation if you're
gonna follow me about everywhere
and break into my flat
like some mad mauler.
- Well you don't think that lock's gonna
keep anyone out do ya?
Jesus Kathy.
I care about you.
I'm only trying to do something about it.
- You want to do something Ed?
- Sure Jacquard, anything, anything.
- Get lost.
- I see.
So much for women's rape fantasies.
- I just don't want any
involvement for a while.
- You want to be alone hm?
It won't work.
You cut yourself off pretty
soon the nerve endings die
and you'll be no better
off than Patrick here.
- Ed accuses me of being frigid.
- Rubbish.
How would he know?
Look it's your body
you're walking around in.
It's you who's got to
make all the decisions
about how you feel.
Listen, you're coming to
a party on Friday night.
- I don't think I can make a party.
- No excuses.
Brian's parties are always
good for what ails you.
Matter of fact, so is Brian.
- Who's Brian?
- Dr. Brian Wright.
He's a neurosurgeon Seven J Ward.
And all right if you
like the playboy type.
- The last thing I need is someone
with a case of galloping gonads.
- Well, you have until
Friday night to decide.
- I'll think about it.
- Listen, do you wanna take my car?
I've got something teed
up with?
Well, they don't call him
Dr. Wright for nothing.
- He's drunk.
- It's a party.
It brings him up a little.
- It was a party, I'm about to go home.
- It won't hurt to talk to him will it?
A little time dead Kathy.
- I was hoping to talk
to him about Patrick.
- Well then talk to him
about Patrick, anything.
He'll do the rest.
- Thanks.
- The keys are in the car.
I'm off for the weekend I think.
- So where were we then?
- Pardon?
- Who are you?
- Kathy Jacquard, where have you been?
- Down there, listening to the stereo.
I always do a couple of
laps after a heavy night.
Clears the head.
I'm Brian.
- Yes I know, we met earlier.
- Oh.
Come on in Kathy.
- Actually, I was hoping to
talk to you about a patient
of mine at the Roget Clinic.
- Ah, you're the new gardener.
- Oh you know about Patrick?
- I read an article somewhere.
You coming in for a swim or not?
- I've eaten.
- So have I.
Come in, clothes or not.
- No, I should be getting home.
- I'll drive you then.
- No, I'll get a cab,
you shouldn't be driving.
- Nonsense, come on, come on in.
- No, really.
- What are you doing!
- It's only me.
More typing from the front office.
You know you shouldn't let on you typed.
- The typewriters playing up.
- Along with the lift and
everything else in this building.
Captain Fraser thinks we've got gremlins.
Hey, what'd you think Brian?
- Well, he shouldn't go
swimming on a full stomach.
- When you off?
- Off, I just got on.
Nurse Panicale rang in sick.
- Again?
I'll see you in the morning.
- Patrick if you can hear me?
Patrick, if you can hear me,
I want you to do that with your mouth
what you just did.
Once means yes and twice
means no, do you understand?
Is that yes?
Do you know where you are?
Do you know who I am?
Can you see me?
Can you feel that?
Wait here.
Matron can I show you
something in room 15?
Patrick, Matron Cassidy is here, show her.
Patrick show her please.
He, he spit.
Brian.
Yeah.
- Is it possible for a whole team
of specialists to be wrong?
- Yes, I'll be the first to admit it.
Most of the time we're
just piddling on our shoes.
- I prefer to think we're
helping the sick and injured.
- I consider it a very damn good day if I
don't make anybody worse.
I used to be in the Crusades.
Great advances in medical science,
the betterment of mankind.
- And now you're just into money.
- No, I'm filthy rich.
I think it's the party's mainly.
- I don't believe a word you're saying.
- All right, let's talk about you.
- Let's talk about Patrick.
- All right, here is the brain.
Two cerebral hemispheres,
each divided into lobes.
Frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital.
Now within each lobe
are over a 100 million
nerve cells and fibers.
Any one of which is capable
of conducting a message
to the cerebral cortex.
You follow me?
- I learnt that in my
first year of nursing.
- Well that's the easy part.
Now sure we can probe
around and find the nerve
that's responsible for
wiggling of patient's toes,
but when it comes to the
more sophisticated functions
of the brain, were in the dark ages.
And what you're after,
is probably the most
sophisticated function of them all.
The nebulous bridge between the conscious
and the unconscious.
- You mean the soul, the life force?
- Do I detect a note of sarcasm?
All right, try this.
I mean anything's possible.
We have five known senses.
Now a man who loses any one
of them, his site for example,
automatically compensates
with a keen sense of hearing,
a finer sense of touch.
Now Patrick with all five senses cut off,
if there is such a thing as a sixth sense,
he's had three years to develop a beauty.
Holy hell.
Wait here.
Yes, who do I have to speak to regarding
breaking and entering?
Thank you.
- Who are you phoning?
- The police, has anything been taken?
- I'd rather not call the police.
- Just a moment.
Yes, just a moment.
Kathy, what's the address here?
- I said I'd rather not
bother the police with this.
- Nonsense, of course you must.
- No.
- Kathy.
I don't get it.
Somebody breaks in and wrecks your flat
and you don't want to report it?
- It's all right.
- It is not all right, he could come back.
- If he comes back I can handle him.
- Don't kid yourself.
- Look, I'm fairly certain
it was my husband Ed.
It's just his little way
of making a point.
I can handle him.
- Come on, I'll help you clean up.
- I can manage thank you.
- Kathy.
- I said I can manage Brian!
- I'll leave you to it then.
- Brian, I'm sorry.
Thanks for caring.
- Tell me something,
if this hadn't happened...
Forget it.
Take care.
- No, my solicitors advised
me not to discuss it with you.
I presumed you'd be getting
in touch with your solicitor.
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about last night Ed.
Unless you were too drunk to remember.
- Too drunk to remember what?
- Honest to God Ed, I'm
really disappointed in you.
- Look Kathy love, I don't
know what you're talking about.
- I said I don't want to discuss it.
- Look love, what is it
I'm supposed to have done?
- Ed, that flat wasn't
much, but it was mine.
I painted it and decorated it,
and I don't see how you could be so cruel.
- Look Kathy, I haven't done anything.
I was nowhere near your flat last night.
- Then where were you?
I don't want to see you again Ed.
Just stay away or I'll get an injunction
and you could deal with the police.
You bastard!
Oh I'm sorry Patrick, I'm sorry.
You can you feel.
Can you feel that?
Can you feel that?
Can you feel that?
Can you feel that?
Can you feel that?
Can you feel that?
Can you feel that?
You can feel that can't you?
- When you have a moment Sister.
Do you believe in euthanasia Sister?
- Well I don't believe in wondering about
with an ampule of--
- Do you believe it in a passive sense
in allowing someone to
die for his own good?
- I don't think anyone
has the right to play God.
- That is a pathetic
answer coming from someone
who calls herself a nurse.
And do you think we should close down the
hospital and all go home?
If there were a God,
that if the patient in room 15 could think
I bet he'd be thinking that God
must have a pretty
monstrous sense of humor.
But of course there isn't any God.
No God, no justice,
no compassion.
Only fear.
So he lies in there month after month,
year after year because nobody,
including myself, has a simple decency
to switch off that machine and let him do
what he should have done three years ago.
He is an embarrassment Sister.
He is a daily reminder
that medicine can prolong
death much more effectively
than it prolongs life.
So if it appears as a
conspiracy to lock him away
it's just that the mere sight of him
is a somewhat offensive
reminder of our own ugliness.
And then you come along.
And not only do remind
us that he is human,
but you claim that he has feelings
and that we have neglected
him and that you,
a second-rate probationary
nurse have discovered something
in a couple of weeks that
our team of specialists
couldn't find out in three years.
And if that were not enough,
you then go over the heads
of Dr. Roget and myself
placing us in an embarrassing situation
by getting an opinion
from an outside doctor.
You then merely proceed to slap
and fondle this patient in a manner
that should see you blacklisted
from every hospital in this country!
And you ask, "Why don't you believe me?"
- I was only trying to help.
- You can.
I'm not going to sack you.
Well quite frankly, I
need every qualified nurse
I can lay my hands on, but
you are to be punished.
And your punishment is
that you shall continue
to be responsible for
the patient in room 15,
and you shall prove that I was
not mistaken in hiring you.
Now I expect you to do
exactly as you're told.
No more and no less.
And I expect you to keep your nose clean,
your mouth shut,
and your hands off.
- Yes Matron.
- And now get out of here.
- I've changed the lock.
Look, I don't care what you think.
I didn't bust this place up last night,
and if I didn't then something else did.
Well someone's got to look after you.
Look, the painters will be in tomorrow,
I'll probably fix the furniture up myself.
That carpet needs cleaning,
I'll borrow Phil's wig and
I'll fix it on the weekend.
Dead Set Jacquard, I didn't do it.
- You know Ed, I've had such a rotten day,
I'm rather pleased to see you.
What's that smell?
- Oh, that smell.
Ah, that is tuna casserole.
- Good God.
- Well tonight's on me.
Ed Jacquard, gentlemen chef, handyman.
Come on, sit down.
Sit down.
Put your feet up.
Now ma'am, can I get you
something from the bar?
A gin and tonic perhaps?
- Gin and tonic.
- Can you help me?
What's the matter?
- Nothing doctor.
- You look as though you've been crying.
- I've got a bad cold.
- Speak up.
- I said I have got a bad cold.
- Look at you, you look awful.
- It's just that it's a bit chilly doctor.
- Good lord woman, if
you're as cold as all that,
go and get a heater out
of the Matrons office.
I would have thought you
would be used to it by now.
- I'm sorry doctor.
- All right, pick it up, plug it in,
and sit down quietly.
For Christ sake, have
Matron get a replacement.
Go home, go to bed, and don't come back
till you can function
without breaking anything.
- I'm sorry about the fight Jacquard.
Dead set.
What went wrong?
- I don't know Ed, a lot of things.
Leaving home, coming here.
It wasn't your fault Ed.
But you should try being
boxed in for 24 hours a day
with nothing but four
blank walls to stare at.
And you'd come home drunk,
stumble into bed, sleep.
And then you turn around and say I was
the one who was hung up.
- Hey now, wait a minute,
you're talking to the new Ed Jacquard.
You watch this.
As from now, I'm completely off it.
Finished.
Cigarettes.
What can I do to make you happy?
A nice sports car?
I'll buy you the sports car,
then you'll have all the
freedom that you want.
Does this mean I can stay the night?
- Let's just start with dinner shall we?
- All right.
You know, if this Patrick person turns up,
you'll have to give him
a tap with a cold spoon.
- Why'd you say that?
- Well isn't that what
you nurses do to a bloke,
you know, when he--
- Yes I know what it means, it's just...
Oh forget it.
- Tuna casserole, ala Jacquard.
- Oh get a scotch pad
you'll burn the table.
Jacquard, I never felt a thing.
Still don't.
- What'd they say at the hospital?
- Partial thickness burns on both hands.
He'll be off work for a month.
- Hello Mr. Winsy, you have a nice lunch?
How are the sparrow people?
- Okay?
- You're getting back with him then?
- Look, I'm only gonna cook
dinner for him one night.
- Well what about Brian?
- Oh, I don't know.
- You kinda want to shove
him down your throat.
But I mean I know he fancies you.
Why don't you give it a try
before you go back to Ed?
Well go back to Ed, he must love you.
It's better to be boxed
up and wheel a feel
than horny in Carlton.
- I'm not horny.
- Well then you've been
around him too long.
You want a good piece of advice Kath?
Get out of here before you
end up like Matron Cassidy.
What's the matter Kath?
Oh it's the room, no air.
- It's him.
It's Patrick.
Paula.
He had an erection the other night.
- So, they all do that,
conscious or unconscious.
- It was different.
- All right, all right, on love.
Hello Captain Fraser, have a nice lunch?
Grimy grout.
- The lift's broken again,
Matron said nobody should use it
to use the stairs.
- Is Matron aware that this
is a hospital not a gymnasium?
- Well do I have to remind
you this is a hospital?
We simply must have that lift
repaired sooner than that.
- Matron, I want you
to do something for me.
- Hold on please.
Look, I am rather busy doctor.
- I want all the early reports on Patrick.
Anything to do with the
details of his accident.
- I imagine someone would have to contact
the police for that information.
- Fine.
- Hello?
Yes, well then I suggest you
make our lift a priority.
What's that?
- It's a cerebral functions monitor.
- Where did it come from?
- I won it in a card game.
- Is this related to anything
I should know about doctor?
- I have a new theory.
I'm going to try some ECT on Patrick
to see if I can shock
some response out of him.
What do you think?
- Since you asked, I
think it's disgusting.
- Yes, yes but it's worth a try.
- I'd love to Brian but I can't.
Nurse Panicale ran in sick
and I'll be here all night.
No, I'm busy on Thursday night.
No, oh I don't know maybe,
it's a bit up in the air at the moment.
Hey Brian, did you mention
our conversation about Patrick
to anyone did you?
Well yes, but I don't want to
talk about it over the phone.
There have been some
interesting developments.
I'll ring you all right?
Yeah I promise.
I gotta go now.
Okay, bye.
Aren't we speaking then?
- Hello, anyone there?
Patrick I didn't type this did I?
You typed it didn't you?
Didn't you!
There Patrick, show me there!
Show me!
Show me Patrick!
Show me!
I've got all night Patrick.
Alright, I'll start it for you.
Let's start with, dear mum.
Is that your mum or my mum?
Because I never had one.
She died when I was a baby.
Well aren't we a clever boy?
What does that mean?
Dear mum.
Patrick, did you wreck my flat?
Why are you doing this?
What do you want?
"Ed burned his hands but it
serves the bastard right."
I didn't type that.
"When he came on a bit strong
"I fixed him up in his own swimming pool."
What did you mean by that?
Patrick.
Patrick.
- Hi.
Did I get you up?
- Oh, come in.
- You have a heavy night or something?
- Yeah.
- Anybody I know?
Yes, Patrick.
- Here, let me do that.
You're not free tonight?
- I don't know.
I mean thanks I just don't know.
So how does your garden grow?
- Hmm?
- Patrick, what are the
interesting developments?
- If I told you I don't
think you'd believe me.
- Why not?
- Matron Cassidy didn't,
Dr. Roget wouldn't.
I'm not sure if I believe it myself.
- Try me.
- What do you call it
when someone has the power
to make things move around the
room without touching them?
- Magic.
- There you are.
You see, I told you you
wouldn't believe me.
- I'm sorry, it's called psychokinesis.
- Last night, I was typing
some letters for Matron.
- Yeah?
Well go on.
- Well, I was typing this letter
and I had a lapse of concentration.
You know, like a daydream.
And when I came to I
looked at what I typed,
well wait a minute.
Now I didn't type that Brian.
I mean my fingers were doing the working,
but I know Patrick did it.
- Patrick typed this?
- Yes, look at this.
"But when he came on a
bit strong I fixed him up.
"Ha ha, in his own swimming
pool of all places."
That's you Brian.
- Is that what you think?
That I came on a bit strong?
- Well I didn't write this, Patrick did.
And look at this.
"Ed burned his hands but it
serves the bastard Wright."
Wright spelled with a W.
Now the night before last my husband Ed
burned his hands on a casserole dish.
How did Patrick know that?
- Exactly.
How did he?
- I'm sorry I shouldn't have mentioned it.
- Now wait a minute Kathy.
You're saying that you think
Patrick was controlling
what you typed on that typewriter?
- Yes.
- Well that's very tall order.
- You think I typed it as some sort
of subconscious projection.
All right.
What about this?
I wasn't even touching the typewriter.
I don't know anything about algebra.
I couldn't have typed that.
What does it mean?
- Nothing.
Kathy, I've seen a man levitate.
He really raised his body
into midair and held it there.
I've seen a Filipino
cabdriver remove a cancer
with a rusty bread knife,
so don't accuse me of narrow mindedness.
- I really should be
getting ready for work.
- It's catch-22 as far
as I'm concerned Kathy.
I can't give an opinion on Patrick
until I've examined him.
And I can't examine him,
because such things are just not done.
It's not fair.
- Hmm, but it's ethical.
- Oh Sister Jacquard, Matron wanted to see
you as soon as you came on.
- You wanted to see me Matron?
- You will recall that when I hired you
it was on condition that
we reserve the option
to terminate you without notice.
- Yes.
- Well I'm afraid I will
have to exercise that option.
I would like you to collect your things
and leave the building immediately.
- Why?
- I never indicated the
position was permanent.
- Is it something I've done?
- Very well, I'll be frank Mrs. Jacquard.
I don't think you are
cut out to be a nurse
in an institution like this.
- It's because of Patrick isn't it?
It's because I know too much.
- If anything, it's because
you know too little.
Even your typing has become erratic.
- My...
It's because Dr. Wright asked permission
to examine Patrick isn't it?
- I really had hoped to avoid
a confrontation Mrs. Jacquard.
I have a very full day.
- You can't do this.
- I can and I have.
Now will you kindly leave?
- Patrick.
What have they been doing to you?
I've got something to tell you.
I've been sacked.
I've got to leave.
Don't you care?
I can't stay.
I haven't any choice.
How can I help you when you do
absolutely nothing to cooperate?
What are you afraid of?
Why don't you want anyone else to know?
Who, when?
I'm going home now.
- Good night Matron.
Oh Matron, was the
repair man here earlier?
- Not that I know of, why?
- Nothing, I just thought I heard
someone working the basement.
Probably just a touch of the rats
as Captain Fraser would say.
Kathy this is ridiculous.
- Well don't do it then.
I wouldn't want you to
do anything unethical
like saving someone's life.
Cut it out.
- Look out!
He's in the wall.
He's in the wall.
- Captain Fraser, what
are we doing out of bed?
When we need anything at
night we ring our buzzer.
Oh Captain.
Well come with me and
I'll get you changed.
- Patrick, this is Dr. Wright,
the one I was telling you about.
He knows and he's going to help you.
How long will this take?
- Talk to him.
- What?
- See if you can get him to respond.
- Patrick, please Patrick, for God sake.
- You said he had an erection.
- Yes.
- Get him to do it.
We haven't got all night Kathy.
All right, let's try something else.
Come and hold this, I wanna
try his reaction to strobe.
- Will it take long?
- This was your idea, now don't rush me.
Hold it eight inches from
the bridge of his nose
and bring it up slowly.
Kathy, look at this.
- Hello?
Oh hello Paula.
Well no, I hadn't intended to.
No, I was dismissed yesterday.
What's wrong?
Well what's wrong, what's happened?
Yes, of course.
I'll be there in about half an hour.
Well the uniformed boys
put in the report last night
and I have to follow it up.
Yes.
- Mrs. Jacquard's here.
- Oh fine, send her in, send her in.
Have a seat please Mrs. Jacquard.
Yes doctor, well the the
point that I'm trying to make
is that the power was off
throughout the whole neighborhood
for just under one hour.
And yet every electric
clock in this building
seems to show the correct time.
- We have our own emergency
generator in the basement.
It comes on automatically in the event
of a power failure.
So the electricity could
only have been off for
two minutes.
- I see.
Well again the electricity people
maintain that the overload
originated here, in this building.
Can you think what might have caused it?
- No, but circuits do
become overloaded.
- Mrs. Jacquard isn't it?
- Yes.
- You're normally responsible for the
patient in room 15 from
noon until nine p.m.
- Yes, normally.
- And yet you weren't in
the building last night.
Mrs. Jacquard?
- No, I was dismissed yesterday.
- That news to me.
But of course Matron
Cassidy has charge of staff.
- What happened here last night?
- Well, your Sister Panicale
was discovered unconscious in
room 15 early this morning.
She appeared to be in a state of
catatonic hysteria.
Is that correct doctor?
- That's close enough.
- Is she all right?
- She's under sedation.
Heavy sedation.
- Well as you see Mrs. Jacquard,
it'll be some time before
we're able to find out from her
what happened and we
were hoping that as you
had been working in room 15,
perhaps we could--
- Sergeant.
Sister Panicale existed
at the brink of hysteria anyway.
She was weak.
She would think of any
excuse to ring in sick.
I dare say that when the lights went off
she probably packed.
- Yes, well I no doubt
there is a perfectly
logical explanation for what happened.
But we were swamped with
telephone calls last night.
No not just to report a power failure,
but everything from barking dogs
to flying saucers.
- Sergeant Grant.
Yes, what is it?
- There's something in the
basement I think you should see.
- Will it wait?
- I don't think so sir.
- Doctor, it's Patrick.
You know it's him don't you?
- There's the cause of your power failure.
Not a pretty way to go.
Make a connection across those terminals,
buzz buzz, vaporize.
Molten copper.
Who is she?
- Matron Cassidy.
- We'll need a pronouncement doctor,
just to make it official.
Doctor?
What do you suppose she
was doing down here?
- Replacing a fuse I suppose.
I, I don't know.
- Is that all you're going to do?
There'll be an inquest.
I need to get some formal statements,
but I'm satisfied.
- You don't believe this
was an accident do you?
- It's what the electricity boys reckon.
She wasn't wearing shoes,
she grounded herself
when she stepped into the puddle, bang.
- But why wasn't she wearing shoes?
And why was she down
there in the first place?
- Look Mrs. Jacquard, please.
Let's not complicate this
any further will you?
- I'm gonna have a hell of a job writing
out a reporter as it is.
- Listen to me.
Matron Cassidy wanted Patrick dead.
Now she's dead.
Does that sound like an accident to you?
- Look, let me get this straight
will you Mrs. Jacquard.
Are you suggesting that she was trying to
kill the patient in room 15?
- I'm saying that there
is a possibility, yes.
- Why?
- Well that's a hard question to answer,
but there is someone you
can explain it better than I
and I think you should see him.
Kathy.
- Brian, Sergeant Grant Dr. Brian Wright.
- Sergeant.
- I'm sorry to bother you.
- What's the problem?
- Something's happening,
Matron Cassidy's dead.
She's been electrocuted.
- I'm sorry.
- Sergeant Grant's investigating the case.
- When she says I'm
investigating the case,
it seems pretty straightforward to me.
- Brian, Matron Cassidy was trying to
switch off the power when she was killed.
- Well we don't know for certain.
She was trying to--
- Don't you see?
Patrick was right.
He said someone would try
to kill him last night
and she did, only he stopped her.
- He stopped her?
- Patrick.
- The one that's been
in a coma for two years?
- Three years.
That's why I thought Brian might be able
to explain better than me.
- Well I'm not quite
sure what you want Kathy.
- Brian I know this is awkward,
but Matron's been killed.
- I'm sorry Kathy, but how can I help?
- Tell him about psychokinesis!
- Kathy, I'd be happy to give the sergeant
a four hour lecture on psychokinesis,
but I hardly think that it has any bearing
on Matron Cassidy's death.
Brian, he's gonna think I'm
mad if you don't say something.
- Kathy.
- Tell him about that night in the pool.
- You mean the night I got the cramp?
- You didn't get the cramp, you know that.
It was Patrick.
- Patrick certainly seems
to get around a bit.
- Kathy, darling--
- Don't patronize me.
I think we should tell
him about last night.
- Oh, I hardly think that's
a matter for the police.
- Are you gonna tell him or shall I?
Mrs. Jacquard--
- Tell him Brian!
- Mrs. Jacquard, would you
please wait in the car?
Mrs. Jacquard.
Tell me about last night doc.
You're not
really interested in my
sex life are you sergeant?
- I still feel as though
there's something I should do.
- You could close the
door on your way out.
You going back to Ed?
- I don't know.
- I'd give it a try.
- Yeah.
Thanks Paula.
Thanks for everything.
Ed!
Phil, I'm trying to find
Ed, have you seen him?
No he's been off work for two days.
I haven't thought of that.
I'll check.
And Phil if you see him...
Yeah a bit.
Okay.
Bye.
Shamrock, Tom Butler.
Who?
- Jacquard, Ed Jacquard.
- Oh yeah yeah.
No I haven't seen him
for a couple of days.
A bit of a stroff with
some lady friend I think.
- Oh I see.
Did he mention her name?
It's very important I contact him.
- No sorry.
Tell you who would know, Neal Adler.
Neal was selling a sports
car and Ed was gonna--
- A sports car?
- He was gonna surprise her with it.
- Oh I see.
I see.
No, it's all right I think
I know who this lady is.
Do you have Neal Adler's number?
Yes I'll wait.
- Why don't you finish early and go home?
- Go home?
- I'll look after everything.
- Doctor are you sure--
- Williams I am still in charge here.
Please just just go home and don't worry.
- Hello, is that Neal Adler?
I'm trying to reach Ed Jacquard.
Oh, I was told he was
going to you about a car.
This is his wife Kathy.
- This is Sergeant Grant.
What can I do for you Mrs. Jacquard?
- Sergeant, I have a problem.
And well, you're the
only policeman I know.
- Lucky me.
What's your problem?
- I seem to have lost my husband.
- I see.
- It's not as crazy as it sounds.
He apparently bought a car from a friend
two days ago, as a gift,
for me actually.
And, he seems to have vanished.
- Help!
Help!
- Hello?
- Grant here Mrs. Jacquard.
I've found your car.
No sign of your husband.
Where was the car?
- Well it was towed away
from a no standing zone
outside the Roget Clinic
earlier this afternoon.
Apparently it had been
there for a couple of days.
Are you there?
- Yes, yes sergeant.
- Incidentally, about that other business,
that Patrick friend of yours is a bit of
a celebrity, you know that?
- What do you mean?
- Well I've been going
through the files here
and it turns out that...
Oh hang on.
Someone's penciled in
a notation here about a
boyfriend of a nurse who
worked there over a year ago.
- What about him?
- He died some unspecified disease.
Says it started with the
numbness in his hands
and then spread.
You there?
Mrs. Jacquard?
- He made me, he did it.
We've got to kill him.
You've got to help me.
Look, look, we'll clear the building,
get everyone out, then burn it.
You can't go in there
you, he won't let you.
No.
No.
- What have you done to my husband?
Patrick.
Where is he?
Talk to me Patrick.
Is that it?
You think I'm a slut?
Why, because I've been unfaithful?
Because I won't belong to you?
Is that why you murdered
your mother Patrick?
What did you think Patrick?
That if you stopped other
men getting close to me
we'd be together forever and ever?
Love?
What do you know about love?
Who'd love you?
You're a self-centered, self-important,
self-indulgent little boy
who never grew up, who wants his mummy.
Go on, get it out of your system.
Your tantrums don't scare me anymore.
Now, what have you done to my husband?
Where is he?
You're wrong Patrick.
Are you better off?
What?
What is it?
I don't understand.
What's Ed done to hurt you?
What have I done to hurt you?
Patrick I can't.
- Better hurry, sign goes on at sunset.
- Who are you?
- I'm Ed Jacquard.
What the hell's going on here?
- She's in there with Patrick.
- Patrick.
Kathy.
Kathy.
- He's dead.
I killed him.
- Nobody killed him, he
died of natural causes.
- Come on lovely, I'll take you home.
- It's alright.
Just a simple motor nerve reflex.
I've seen it before.
Some people argue it's the life force.
The soul departing the body.
Anyway, it's ended.
So that's Patrick?
That's Patrick.
