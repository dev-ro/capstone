What the hell are you doing?
Leave her alone.
It will distract her training!
All I did was ask her out to a movie.
I think there's a cinema just over there.
Watch it.
J. Jae, that boy Mzee's
going to steal the love of my life.
Have you even spoken to her yet?
No. First impressions are really important.
Any advice?
OK, but listen carefully.
I'm only going to say this once.
First, act like you're
not interested in the girl.
By the way, her name's Nana.
But you've never talked to her, right?
You shouldn't know her name.
Don't use her name,
give her a nick name instead.
A nickname?
Baby... Bunny...
Poochie?
"Zodiac Vase Embarks On Worldwide Tour"
Good to see you again.
You too, Mr. Song.
I'm sorry, but you'll have to excuse me...
Good night.
Which means you're back in business...
Right?
After you.
Thank you.
Hello?
It's Mr. Song. Have you found it yet?
We're working on it.
Let me remind you,
the Zodiac Vase is one of China's
most valuable antiques.
Don't worry, when we find it
you'll be the first to know.
We have put a trace on his phone.
OK.
I'll wait to hear from you.
Don't let me down.
What is it now?
Tell me you've found them.
Stop! Police!
Calling all units. 22 Kangding Road.
Surround the area immediately.
Hold on! Looks like he's stopped.
Tracker says he's right here.
He should be here.
He should be here.
This way.
Can you see me?
I'm right above you...
- Hi.
- Hi, it's me.
Remember we're going out
to celebrate after your meeting.
Are you still up for it?
Yes. I've just had to pop home
to pick up some documents.
Perfect. I could come and pick you up.
Thanks, but by the time you get here
I'll be back at work.
OK. See you tonight then.
Aren't you Danny's friend?
I've seen your drone. It's cool.
Yeah. I've got a better one now.
She's got 3-axle stabilisation gimbal
and a high def maps database.
Transmits via Lightbridge
direct to my PC & mobile devices.
You don't get out much do you?
Hold on...
Danny's in trouble.
I need your help.
I'll go cuff him.
Wait a minute.
I'll help.
Great. Can I borrow your scooter?
No. It's only me that drives that.
That works.
That cop car is still following us.
Good. Let him follow.
Watch out!
He wants to see the money.
Is he crazy?
Enough!
It's right behind you,
first shelf, the first one.
Take the next right.
Right turn, right! Right!
I think you need to apologise.
He started it.
Boss.
The vase, it's real.
Let's go.
Wait.
My friend says
your scar looks really cool.
Who gave it to you?
My thumb...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Hurry up. We're nearly there.
Go faster. Go faster.
Damn!
Calling all units!
That's them!
Freeze!
Danny says I have to follow the vase.
He always saves
the most dangerous stuff for me.
So would you mind driving, Bunny?
Sure.
But call me Bunny again
and you can go there on foot.
What are you doing?
What are you doing here?
Where is my tea?
In your study.
Miss Yen, phone call.
Bring the car around I have a meeting.
The gallery is full of smoke.
Stop. You're those kids
from the pottery factory.
Let's go!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
It's Song.
Good night.
This artist is renowned
for his subtlety and minimalism...
...perfectly complementing
Ji hotel's stylish interiors.
If only your hotel...
If only your hotel...
It's a great opportunity...
Please excuse me.
Hello?
It's me. Get downstairs now!
We're on our way to pick you up.
Get down there now!
What's up?
I have to wait for my uncle...
...something might have happened to him.
Letâ€™s wait in the car.
Just do what we say,
and you won't be hurt.
Give him your phone.
Chuck it.
Have some water.
Do you know why I brought you here?
Clever girl.
He's very persistent.
I don't understand you people
and your pursuit of love.
Do you even know what love is?
It's eternal and impossible to achieve.
Understand?
I think I can but you can't.
What a pity.
Let me explain.
When I want something...
...I will always get it.
Don't.
You're better than that.
You feel for her.
Why do men like you
always go for these useless women?
You're all crazy.
Bring her.
Welcome back. My precious.
Miss Mo...
Thank you for your help.
You are free to go.
It's been a pleasure.
Not you.
You said we could go.
Did I?
No. I said you could go.
But he did what you asked.
You have the art.
Miss Mo, I suggest you leave now!
Leave him. Come and get the art.
Get the art now!
I'm happy you came back...
You remembered what I told you?
Loyalty is everything whether you're right...
or in this case... wrong.
Good night.
I'm still watching you.
Good to know.
Or... you could call me Baby.
