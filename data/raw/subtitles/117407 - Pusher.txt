You said you'd come when it's sold.
And now. . .no money here.
And that's okay.
We're friends, ha-ha. . .
So you come and say

That's a lot, yeah?
That's not a lot? l don't know. . .

That's early.

Then think of something.
Movie?
We'll see a good movie.

- What are we gonna see?
- l don't know what's playing.
l'd rather rent a video.
Let's get out of here.
l need some birth-control pills.
You think that ''2nd-Half Sport'' girl
digs sport in the second half?
- Sport in the second half?
- Butt-fucking.
- Butt-fucking? l don't know, why?
- l saw her yesterday and wondered.
You see her and wonder if she's into
butt-fucking? What's wrong with you?
- You think she's good-looking?
- She's okay.
- l like the Wheel of Fortune girl.
- Nina. . .
- Nina's okay.
- Big-time sport in the second half.
What about the black chick
from Eye on Entertainment?
You wanna butt-fuck her?
l hear apes do it a lot. . .

So what? So you thought. . .
Stop thinking so much.
Vitamins?
- Lotte Larzen?

What about Line?
The anchorwoman. . .

- Yeah, l would.
- First the news, then the sports?
- And she's thin, so no shit-dick.
- Pay.
- What. . .?
He'll pay.
l can't take it anymore. Pay. . .
Vic and me. . .
- l've never fucked Vic.
- You haven't?
l can't.
l can't deal with paid-for pussy.
The first time, when she was just
lyin' there. . .all doped-out. . .
l had my hand between her legs. . .
But she sucks my dick.
She sucks a real good dick.
- Never stick your dick in a whore.
- l don't mind.
- l once fucked up a client of hers.
- Why?
l was driving around and saw her
coming out of a building.
This guy followed her out.
So l followed him
over to the pisser by the church. . .
So, he's standing there, pissing.
l went over to him and said. . .
''Man, you got a little dick, huh?''
He couldn't do anything
'cause he was pissing.
What then?
l said, ''That's the ugliest dick
l've ever seen.''
Then l took him by the neck. . .
He goes down. . .
So l did a few
Fred Astaire moves on him.
- You should've kicked him.
- There's no room in there to kick.
Here, watch this. Stand still.
Take these. . .
Circle kick. . .
- Stand still, man. Come here.
- lf you hit me. . .
Shit!

Frank Jensen, 290967-2451 , charged

- Coffee?
- Yes, please.
Have you warmed up a bit?
What were you doing
in that rental car?
Swedish rental car. . .
- Who were the Swedes?
- You flew out of that car.
You stampeded a cop,
with a brown cloud around you. . .
and made us wade out in the water
to get you and a bag.
Do you know how deep the shit is
under your feet?
- What kind of dope was it?
- Man, you gotta talk slower.
- Was it 200 grams?
- l don't know anything about it.
ln 1 991 you got six months
for possession of cocaine. Correct?
- l was in, l can't remember why.
- Can we agree you're in deep shit?
You're in deep.
Someone must want their money.
- You got anything to say?
- l'd like a private bath next time.
- Should we let him think about it?
- lt's filthy in there.
They pay you shit, so they must have
enough left for cleaning ladies.
THURSDAY
lt's cleaning time.
You can do the rest yourself.
Where did it come from,
and who was buying it?
Still nothing to say?
Come on, Frank, you're wasting time.
You can't hold me more than
24 hours. Stick to the rules, boys.
What time is it?
- You only got a few minutes left.
- There's some people outside. . .
- You don't know anything.
- No, that's why you're here.
You don't know shit. . .

Come on, Frank.
Don't play the hero.
Come on, Frank.
Come on, Frank.
Say something.
lt's for your own good.
We know there's a lot of people
waiting for you.
- Nothing, huh?
- Take your clothes and piss off.
The time is 2:00 p.m., it's Thursday
the 22nd, and you're released.
lf you want to talk,
you know where we are.
Milo. . .
l'm sorry, Milo.
Frankie. . .
What a surprise, Frankie.
l'm sorry
l didn't show up yesterday.
- We had a deal? l don't remember.
- l was gonna come with the money.
Radovan, can you remember
if we had an appointment yesterday?
Come here.
Sit down, Frank.
What then?
l don't have the dope,
and l don't have the money.
Why don't you have the dope,
and why don't you have the money?
- The police got me yesterday.
- You were busted?
Frank was busted!
With 200 grams, yeah?
And you're not in jail, or solitary,
or whatever it's called?
That's strange. What do l say?
That's strange.
lt's in the lake.
All the dope's in the lake.
- The dope's in the lake?
- lt's in the lake.
200 grams in the lake.
My best friend in Copenhagen.
Frank. . .
200 grams in the lake, yeah?
Tell me some more.
- There isn't. . .
- Help me.
We're you busted or not?
Come on, l told you l was busted.
- lf you were, show me your papers.
- l don't have papers. What papers?
You don't get papers
if they don't find anything.
lt's like a bad joke. . .
Should l believe you, Frank?
What do l do now?
You owe me 1 80 now.
lt's not 1 80, it's 1 20.
How much did we say?
The deal was 1 20,
and l owe you 50 from last week.
No, no. . .
No, Frankie.
lt was 1 20. lt was.
But now it's 1 80.
1 80.
You want to ask why?
Ask. . .
- Why?
- lt's for the story you brought me.
You see, it keeps getting bigger.
So, it's 1 80. . .50 now.
Frank. . .
What can you do?
Can you bring me some money now?
lf Radovan comes with me now,
l can get you 50,000.
- l just gotta take care of something.
- Can you do it?
There's a guy who owes me 50.
We can do it now.
- And the rest?
- Next week.
Okay. 50 now. . .
Do you want coffee?
- l'll be back in a little while.
- Take care.
What's goin' on?
What are you doin'?
What did you tell the cops?
What are you doin'?
What the fuck are you doin'?
What did you tell the cops?
Fuck you!
Take it easy, Frank.
What did you say?
Did you say something?
- ls he dangerous?
- No.
He's just the kind
who buys and buys without paying.
Either he's not home,
or says he'll pay tomorrow.
You gotta be on 'em 24 hours a day,
always reminding them what they owe.
There was this Turk who fucked up
and was into Milo for 30,000.
So l had to go out there.
l'd been there a few times. . .
and asked for the money nicely.
ln the end l had to go out there
with a knife.
l stuck it into his knees and tore
it up, so the kneecap came out.
l'll tell you, Frank, l think a lot
about doing something else.
- Just leaving this all behind.
- What would you do?
Milo's a good cook, right?
Especially cakes.
But l'm a good cook, too.
Shish kebab. That's my specialty.
You gotta try it sometime.
l get special spices for it.
There's nothing else like it.
l mean it, l'm thinking about
opening a restaurant.
l haven't told anyone but you,
not even Milo.
lt's top secret.
But it's got to be the right place.
- ln town?
- Yeah, if l can make it all happen.
Then Milo can deliver the desserts.
Don't tell me you like that stuff.
No way. . . He can't bake.
- He doesn't eat them himself.
- l know why.
- Frank. . .
- Do you have the money or not?
- l thought we agreed. . .
- Fuck that, l need it now.
- l can get it on the first.
- l need it now, not on the first.
Don't touch me!
Let's see some fuckin' money.
You've owed me 52 for a long time.
Why haven't you paid?
l had some problems.
There's some things. . .
You think it's a joke?
- lt's not a game anymore.
- Calm down.
lf you don't help me,
l can't help you. l need it now.
- You used to play with my brother.
- Does your brother have the money?
Then how can he help? He'll rip your
kneecaps out if you don't pay up.
What am l gonna do with your watch?
Deal with it, Joakim. lt's not
my money. l can't help you anymore.
Take it easy. . .
You're a swindler, huh?
Can you get it, or can't you?
Listen, l know this sand-nigger,
he can get the money.
Fuckin' Paki-lover. . .
lt's my money, do you understand?
Can you get the money now?
Right now? Then l have an idea. . .
- You can get the money at the bank.
- He can't rob a bank.
- Anyone can rob a bank.
- He can't even hold that thing.
- lt's 3:45, how can he rob a bank?
- That's it, the problem's solved.
He can't rob a bank,
he doesn't have the balls.
We just have time.
What bank do we rob?
l don't care.
- What bank do you use?
- No, he can't rob his own bank. . .
- There's nothing else around.
- We'll do the first one we see.
- What about. . .
- Let's go.
- Easy, easy. . .
- Take it easy, man.
lf you popped one of us, the other
would've blown your brains out.
lt's time to go.
Can l have a line?
- Yeah, when you give us the money.
- Give him one now.
- Just give him one. . .
- He gets shit until it's done.
lt's 3:45, we gotta go.
Come on, Paki-lover.
So, what do we do now?
l'll tell Milo about it. Make sure
you have the money tomorrow.
- Don't forget.
- l won't.
- Sorry. . .
