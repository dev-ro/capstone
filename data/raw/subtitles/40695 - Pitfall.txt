[MUSIC PLAYING]
Johnny!
Johnny!
Hurry up.
Can you hear me?
Yeah, I can hear you.
Well, hurry up then.
Johnny!
Oh, your breakfast is
on the table, darling.
Where else would it be?
Hm?
Oh, nothing.
Good morning, Dad.
Hi.
Don't forget you're going
to give me $5.00 today.
$5.00?
Why should I?
Oh, you remember dear.
His class is raising
money for the summer camp.
The way prices are
these days, kids
Are going to start
raising money for us.
Dad, you promised.
All right.
Don't spend all
that on the women.
I've got to buy him a new pair
of shoes this afternoon, too.
Shoes?
What does he do with
his shoes... eat them?
He's outgrown his good ones.
When I was his age,
I went barefoot.
Sunday school?
Everywhere.
[WHISTLE]
That's Jimmy.
I got to get going.
Is there anything you
want me to do today, Dad?
Yeah.
Until my rich uncle
dies, quit growing.
Good bye, Mom.
Good bye, dear.
You better hurry.
It's getting late.
So what.
What?
I said so what if I am late.
Oh, nothing I just
thought you'd like to know.
So, let's don't
go to work today.
Let's go fishing.
Oh, fine.
Let's pick Tommy up and get
in the car and just keep going.
They got a road that goes all
the way to South America now.
Some other time, thanks.
You think the world
would stop if we did?
You think the Olympic Mutual
Insurance Company would go out
Of business if I didn't walk
through that door exactly 9:00
Every morning?
You never can tell.
You were voted the
prettiest girl in the class.
I was voted the boy
most likely to succeed.
Something should happen
to people like that.
Something did.
We got married.
Whatever happened
to those two people
Who were going to build a boat
and sail around the world?
Well, I had a baby.
I never did hear
what happened to you.
Oh come on, wanderlust.
You've got a family to support.
No South America?
Not today.
What time are you coming
home tonight, dear?
Now, why do you ask me
a question like that?
You know to the second
what time I'll get home.
I leave the office at
exactly 4 minutes after 5:00.
It takes six minutes
to walk to the corner
Where Charlie picks
me up at exactly 5:15.
It takes 32 minutes
to drive home
Unless we hit a couple
of stop signals.
And I'm kissing you on
the cheek at exactly 5:50.
Old man routine
getting you down again?
Oh, I don't know.
Sometimes I get to
feel like a wheel
Within a wheel within a wheel.
You and 50 million others.
I don't want to be
like 50 million others.
But you're John Forbes,
average American,
Backbone of the country.
I don't want to be an
average American, backbone
Of the country.
I want somebody else to be
the backbone and hold me up.
You've been reading Tommy's
geography book again...
Glamorous Borneo, rubber
plantations and dusty dames.
Well, it sounds a lot better
than glamorous Olympic Mutual
Insurance Company, Inc.
Speaking of which, we're here.
Oh, well see you
at exactly 5:50.
Wait a minute.
I'm getting a little bored of
that kiss on the cheek, too.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
And let's have a better mood
when you come home tonight.
I'll give it all I got trying.
Bye, dear.
Good morning, Mr. Forbes.
How's every little thing?
Fine, just fine.
Good morning, Johnny.
Come on in.
Good morning, Mr. Forbes.
Good morning, dear.
Don't forget, you and Sue are
having dinner with us tonight.
Oh, is that tonight?
Is it that hard to take?
Let me ask you something, Ed.
What did we do a
week ago tonight?
Hm.
Had dinner, played bridge.
Two weeks tonight?
Same thing.
Two years ago tonight,
three years ago tonight?
You mean we're...
We're in a rut?
Six feet deep.
Let's revolt, Ed.
When the girls bring
out the cards tonight,
Let's stand on our
constitutional rights
And get drunk instead.
If you want to.
That's the spirit.
Now, don't forget.
But I thought you
liked to play bridge?
I do, but a man has to
draw the line somewhere.
Good morning, Maggie.
Good morning, Mr. Forbes.
Hello, friend.
Hello, Mac.
What do you want?
Just a kind word and a pat on
the back for a job well done.
Come in.
Hold the calls, Maggie.
What job?
The Smiley embezzlement case.
I located about $4,000.
He had it well hidden.
Where?
Mona Stevens, 427
North Stockton.
Nice work.
No strain.
Did you talk to her?
Yeah, when I wasn't
busy looking at her.
I don't blame him for
robbing his company.
She's worth it.
Maggie, bring in the
Continental Finance Company
File, will you?
MAGGIE (INTERCOM):
Yes, Mr. Forbes.
She have the cash, or what?
Nothing so crude.
He bought her a lot
of little pretties,
Fur coat, little
things like this.
Did she know they were
bought with stolen money?
Eh, he's been in the
can for four months.
I think she has a vague idea.
How much are you liable for?
Thanks, Maggie.
Oh, around $10,000.
I bet you never thought
of me as a man who
Could fall in love.
You'd be surprised
how little time I
Have to think about
you at all, Mac.
Now, this Mona Stevens,
she's quite a girl.
We're liable for around
$10,000 for what he stole.
I want as much of
it back as possible.
Of course.
If you want me to, I'll have
another talk with her again
Today.
I intended to anyway.
Your part of the
job is finished, Mac.
The company will
handle it from here.
What's the matter
with me handling it?
You'd string it along
just to see the girl again.
What business is that of yours?
If you want any more
business from this company,
Just stick to your
detective agency.
I did all right.
I found her, didn't I?
That's all you're paid to do.
I'll handle it from here.
You uh... don't mind if I see
her on my own time, do you?
Not at all.
When you see her, put
in a word for me, huh?
Sure, Mac.
I'll set up the
whole thing for you.
Thanks.
Anything else for me to do?
I'll let you know.
Get the phone calls, Maggie,
and order me a company car
For this afternoon.
MAGGIE (INTERCOM): Yes, sir.
Good bye, Mac.
Good bye, friend.
[DOORBELL]
Is anybody home?
Hello?
Anybody home?
You want beer,
it's in the icebox.
Are you a prowler or do
you have a search warrant?
I was looking for
Miss Mona Stevens.
I'm Mona Stevens.
Don't wait for an invitation,
just let yourself in.
I'm sorry.
I'm John Forbes, Olympic
Mutual Insurance Company.
Make yourself at home.
Sit down.
Thank you.
Take off your hat.
That was quite a boy you
sent to see me yesterday.
I've met some weird
ones in my life
But that one nearly
scared me to death.
MacDonald isn't
with the company.
He's a private detective
we use sometimes.
I don't care who he is.
I'm sorry he annoyed you.
He shouldn't be let
loose without a keeper.
I suppose you're after
the gifts Smiley gave me.
That's right.
I don't suppose
you'd believe me
If I told you I didn't ask
him for any of those things.
It doesn't matter
one way or the other.
Doesn't it?
I'd like a list of the
articles if you don't mind.
What will you do with them?
Try to realize what we can.
My company bonded Mr.
Smiley for $10,000.
We had to make it good
when he stole the money.
I thought he was
paying for that in jail.
Unfortunately, that doesn't
give us back a penny.
Supposing I decide
to be difficult.
Then we'll be difficult.
You'd have a hard time
proving that any of those gifts
Were bought with stolen money.
We'd have a hard
time, but we'd do it.
Are you going to
cooperate, Miss Stevens?
I don't know.
What good would it do Smiley?
Well, he uh... he
only got a year.
He's eligible for
parole in two months.
If we recovered some of the
money, it might help him.
Then again, it might not.
Who cares.
I don't want this stuff anyway.
Have you got a pencil?
Oh it's a pen.
I've got a fur coat.
A car... he made
the down payment.
I've got a few dresses
and an engagement ring.
It's not very good diamond,
but believe it or not,
It's the first engagement
ring I've ever had.
I'm rather fond of it.
I'm sorry to have to do this.
I don't think you are.
Believe me, I don't
enjoy this sort of thing.
I don't suppose you do In face,
I don't imagine you like it
Or dislike it.
What do you mean?
You're a little man
with a briefcase.
You go to work every morning
and you do as you're told.
Today they said, go to
such and such an address
And pick up some stolen goods.
So here you are.
Tonight, when you're
sitting around with the boys
Having a beer, you'll
say "you should"
Have seen the babe
I ran into today.
Not bad.
"But you know me, strictly
business when I'm on the job."
Is that the way I impress you?
That's the way.
How should I be?
If you were a nice guy, you'd
cry a little bit with me.
You'd really feel sorry for
a girl whose first engagement
Ring was bought by a man
stupid enough to embezzle
And stupid enough to get caught.
Would I take the ring?
Sure, that's part of your job.
But you'd act a little
human while you're doing it.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
At this time of day?
According to statistics,
insurance men
Drink 1 and 3/4 high
balls every day.
But only after
the sun goes down.
You know, I'd shoot
myself if I thought
I was turning into sort
of guy you just described.
I not only have a drink,
but I have a gun, too.
Let's take the drink first.
If that doesn't work, I'll make
a deal with you on the gun.
What about the boat?
Boat?
Yes, the boat.
You mean you and your
playmate didn't know about it?
No.
Well, might as well
make it complete.
I'll show it to you.
Looking at my samples?
Yes.
You photograph very well.
I better.
It's my business.
Your Olympic Mutual what's
its name doesn't advertise,
Does it?
Well, yes but in
our business we
Run more like photographs of
the Rock of Gibraltar or eagles.
Then I'm afraid
I'm not your type.
Let's go.
You can leave that.
I hardly think we'll
be gone overnight.
Will they be all right here?
They have been so far.
All right.
I guess you're just a
natural born athlete.
This morning I was talking
about going to South America.
I don't think I could make
it to South Los Angeles.
Cheer up.
We're here.
Somebody's been kidding me.
Crime does pay.
Oh, not that one.
The one over there.
Oh.
What'd you expect...
The Queen Mary?
Do you think you can make it
or do you want me to take over?
Are you kidding?
I'm good for another 10 seconds.
Well, what do you
think of my baby?
Not bad.
You should have seen
her before I painted her.
You painted her?
You'd be surprised
what a little elbow
Grease will do when
you're short of money.
Of course, you wouldn't
know about that.
No, I work for an
insurance company.
Let's take her out.
You mean you want
to take a ride?
Why not?
The company's time, your gas.
Would you like to
take over for a while?
Sure.
Who wants to live forever?
Lots of fun, isn't it?
Certainly is.
You're really crazy
about this aren't you?
I'd rather have it more than
anything I've ever owned.
Didn't you promise something
about buying me a drink?
That's right.
I did.
You better take her in.
This is the life.
Have you ever noticed?
If, for some reason, you
want to feel completely
Out of step with the rest of
the world, the only thing to do
Is sit around a cocktail
lounge in the afternoon.
Why?
You sit around in
the gloom and have
A few quiet, meditative drinks.
You get everything figured out.
Then you go out and
the sun hits you.
And you feel like
something that's
Been drinking in a gopher hole.
How did you ever get mixed
up with someone like Smiley?
As the girl said,
just lucky, I guess.
Anyway, he was just too
much in love with me.
He wanted to do things for me
and he didn't have the money,
So... he went out and got some.
Did he have to?
Was it that important to you?
No, but he didn't know it.
I liked him mostly
because he was nice to me.
Very few men are.
And that means a lot.
What do you care about me?
Oh, just curious, I guess.
Well, that's flattering.
I didn't mean it that way.
I guess I'm a little
out of practice.
I never quoted anything
but statistics.
I'm a little unsure
of myself whenever
I crawl out of my briefcase.
I'm sorry I laid into you like
that back at the apartment.
Got you a free
drink, didn't it?
Do you have to be
someplace for dinner?
No.
No, I don't have to be anywhere.
Well, here's to dinner.
Mr. Forbes, there were
three phone calls for you
While you were out to lunch.
I put them on your desk.
Thanks, Maggie.
And gruesome's in
there waiting for you.
Who?
Mac.
Oh.
Greetings, friend.
Do you want to see me
about something special
Or do you just like
to sit in my chair?
Why the chill?
Chill?
No chill.
I've just got a
lot of work to do.
Sure, sure.
I get it.
I've just been
looking over a list
Of things you recovered
from Mona Stevens.
Yeah?
You must be slipping, Johnny.
What about the boat?
Boat?
What boat?
The boat Smiley bought for her.
I've got a bill of sale on
it from the Nolan Company.
I must have missed it.
You must've.
She's quite a girl, isn't she?
Yeah.
Got another job for you, Mac.
Fine.
I'm always glad to go to work.
Maggie, bring in the files
in the Hall case, will you?
MAGGIE (INTERCOM): Yes, sir.
You know it's a funny thing.
Take this Mona Stevens now.
Maybe she wouldn't
appeal to most guys,
But for me she's got everything.
The minute I saw her,
it was just like that.
I don't think she feels
the same about you, not
From what she said yesterday.
Well, she's a little
coy, that's all.
But once she gets used to
me, we'll make a great team.
Oh, I'm sorry.
The Hall case file, Mr. Forbes.
Thank you, Maggie.
Like I said she
probably doesn't
Appeal to you, but
for me just what
I told the doctor to order.
What did you find to talk to her
about so long yesterday Johnny?
Look, Mac are you interested
in this job or not?
Sure.
Sure, I'm sorry.
Can't let women interfere
with business, can we?
[DOORBELL]
Oh, hello.
Come on in.
Just passing by
or did you go out
Of your way to make this call?
I went out of my way.
Well, that's nice.
Sit down.
How's the insurance business?
And what's happened
in the outside world
That I should know about?
Well, a couple of things.
They took possession of
your boat this afternoon.
MacDonald found out
I let you keep it.
He could have caused
trouble at the office.
MacDonald?
He was pounding on my door
last night until all hours.
Funny isn't it?
I meet someone who's kind.
He tries to do
something nice for me
And almost immediately
he's in trouble.
You mean I'm nice?
Yes, you tried.
You came over and
told me personally.
You could have told
me over the telephone
Or just waited until I went
down to the boat some Sunday
And found it gone.
Don't worry about it.
Why is it you get
attached to things
That really don't
make any difference?
I don't know.
But I know how it is.
I had a car once
that was repossessed.
I had 10 cars since.
Never liked any of them
as well as that one.
It was probably your first car.
It was.
This is my first boat.
I wish I could do
something to help.
Don't try.
You'll end up where Smiley is.
But... but thanks for
wanting to anyway.
You're funny.
How?
You're not at all like the man
who walked in here yesterday.
Well, from the
way you described
The man who walked
in here yesterday,
I'd say anything would
be an improvement.
Maybe that's what I meant.
Have you decided to
adopt me or something?
I just wanted to make a report.
I didn't get very far on
the Hall call case today.
I was tailing
someone else... you.
Stay out of my business, Mac.
I will as long as it
doesn't interfere with mine.
I told you I like that girl.
Johnny, I like that girl.
I don't care what you like
or what you don't like.
Quit meddling in my life, Mac.
All right, Johnny.
And don't ever let me catch you
prowling around my home again.
You won't.
Maybe this will keep you home
when you belong for a few days.
And don't bother to
tell me I'm fired.
I quit.
All right, fine.
Thanks very much.
Outside line, please.
Mona Stevens.
WOMAN (OFFSCREEN): Hello, Mona.
Hi.
OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Olympic
Mutual Insurance Company.
Mr. Forbes, please.
MAGGIE (ON PHONE):
Mr. Forbes' office.
Mr. Forbes, Mona
Stevens calling.
MAGGIE (ON PHONE): Sorry Miss
Stevens, he isn't in today.
He's home ill.
Oh it is something serious?
MAGGIE (ON PHONE): Oh, no.
It's just a cold.
I'm sure he'll be
in in a few days.
I'll tell him you called.
Well, thank you.
Hi, Mona.
Oh, Terry, may I
borrow your car?
Sure OK.
I've got a friend who is sick.
I'm going to take off an hour.
Oh, all right.
Terry, what do men
like when they're sick?
Lots of soup, plenty of
babying and some like bourbon.
There that'll take care of you.
And take it easy.
How long will I be laid up?
Oh, you'll be all
right in a week or two.
Did they get much Johnny?
I was only carrying
about $20.00.
There were two of them or
he could have handled them,
Couldn't you, Dad?
Yeah, I suppose so.
Dad was a boxer in college.
I think he was wise to go
into the insurance business.
I don't know why you won't
let me call the police.
We've been over that, Sue.
But it worries me, Johnny.
To think that those
men could be waiting
For you right in
your own garage.
They won't be back.
Maybe if they come
back, you and I
Could beat them up, huh Dad?
Why aren't you in school today?
It's Saturday.
Go on out and play anyway.
All right.
Pick this up at the drugstore.
What is it?
A course in boxing.
See you later, Johnny.
Is there anything
else I can get you?
Nothing, thanks.
What really happened, Johnny?
Oh, I'll be up in a few days.
Nothing to worry about.
All right, Johnny.
You play too
rough, Tommy Forbes.
Now, Tommy.
You know your father's sick.
You children want to play,
run on over to Jimmy's house.
Good bye, Sue.
Don't worry about your husband.
He'll live.
Thanks and good bye, Doctor.
Are you looking for someone?
Thank you, yes but I think
I'm on the wrong street.
We've missed you Mr. Forbes.
How are you feeling?
Much better, thank you Maggie.
You've quite a bit
of mail and I've
Put all the telephone
calls on one list.
Would you go through
the mail for me, please?
Oh, sure.
How about the fifth, Charlie?
Be with you in a minute.
How much?
Johnny, I'm over here.
Hello.
How are you feeling?
Oh, much better, thanks.
I was laid up for a few days.
I caught sort of a cold and...
Yes, Mac told me about it.
Oh.
You don't think he'd
overlook the chance
To play hero in
front of me, do you?
I didn't come here
to talk about Mac.
That suits me.
What shall we talk about?
Well, a couple of things I
should have mentioned before,
And didn't.
You mean like your wife and
the fact that you're married.
Now you'd like to know
how I found out about it.
Simple.
I heard you were sick.
I bought some food
to take to you.
Viola.
High school French.
I'm sorry, Mona.
I rather imagine you are.
What can I do?
About what?
You, of course.
What do you want to do?
Look, I... I've done something
I'm terribly ashamed of.
I'd like to make it up to you.
If you think I'm going to
stand in competition with a wife
And child you've knocked
out more sense than that?
What's going to happen to you?
What do you care, really?
Honestly, Johnny, aren't
you a little relieved
To get out it this easily?
This is a set up, Johnny.
This is the kind of girl
you've always dreamed about.
I'm going to let you
off without an angle.
I could be nasty, but
I'm not going to be.
Why?
I don't know but
I'm not going to be.
Can I buy you a drink?
No, you can't.
What happens to men
like you, Johnny?
If I had a nice
home like you did,
I wouldn't take a chance with
it for anything in the world.
I'll do anything I can.
Will you really?
All right.
Then go home.
Stay there.
All right.
If that's the way you want it.
If that's the way I want it?
Have you got any other ideas?
You left this the other night.
I'm sure you'd be
lost without it.
Good bye, Johnny.
OK, call you later.
May I have your order, sir?
There.
That'll do it.
Yeah, say you know all
about everything don't you?
Just about.
What did you do during the war?
Anything I was told.
I mean, where were you?
Well, most of the
time I was stationed
In uh, Denver, Colorado.
Denver, Colorado?
What's the matter with that?
The Japs never got
into Denver as long
As your father was there.
Thanks, dear.
Anytime.
Jimmy's father was decorated.
Well, your father got the good
conduct medal and four oak leaf
Clusters.
Really?
Wait until I tell Jimmy!
His father only got
the silver star.
Son, I don't think I'd
do that if I were you.
It might sound like boasting.
Are we going to take
a trip this year?
I don't know.
Why?
I'm tired of this
town all the time.
Well, what's the
matter with this town?
People all over the world
would like to live here.
That's the trouble
with your generation.
You don't appreciate
the things you have.
You've got one of the nicest
homes in the block... security.
If you aren't the strangest
husband I ever married.
That's the trouble
with whole world today.
Nobody appreciates
what they have.
Everybody else's
pasture looks greener.
What's come over you?
Contentment.
And that's the
secret of happiness
And don't you forget it.
All right.
I won't.
Come on.
I'll take you to
the picture show.
No necking in front
of the children.
Come on.
Picture show.
I'd like to see
that one over there.
Would you kindly have
her step over, please?
Certainly, sir.
Oh, Miss Stevens
this gentleman would
Like to see the dress, please.
Leave me alone, Mac.
You don't understand.
I'm buying some things
for a girl I know.
She happens to be
just about your size.
Get out of here, Mac.
Just a moment.
I came here to buy some
clothes for a friend of mine.
I have the money.
Or perhaps if we
call the manager.
I think you'll find my
credit is good enough.
If it isn't, I have
enough cash on me.
Sorry.
I'll show you the dress.
Thank you.
Would you mind taking
off the shawl, please?
Off I said.
Would you mind turning
slowly so I can see the back?
Yes.
Yes, I like that.
I'll take the dress.
Now, I'd like to see a few more.
Thanks a lot, Terry.
See you tomorrow.
Good night.
Good night, Mona.
Worked hard today?
Give me a cigarette.
Mac, there's no use
waiting for me anymore.
Don't waste your time.
I'm simply not interested.
Maybe I feel like
wasting my time.
All right.
Let me put it another way.
I don't like you.
I don't want you around.
Sure, but what about me?
I've got some feelings.
Suppose I like to hang around.
It won't do you any good, Mac.
Why don't you believe that?
Guess I'm just stubborn.
Or Maybe I figure I know you
better than you know yourself.
All right.
I've asked you nicely.
You better leave me
alone, Mac or I'm
Going to call the police.
I wouldn't call the
police if I were you.
You wouldn't want to call Johnny
and Mrs. Forbes any trouble,
Would you?
Why don't we have
dinner tonight?
Good morning, Mr. Forbes.
Good morning, Miss.
Good morning.
Good morning, Eileen.
How's every little thing?
Just fine.
Top of the morning
to you, Maggie.
Same to you, Mr. Forbes.
Here's a telegram for you.
Oh, may I help you, sir?
Yes.
Where can I find Miss Stevens?
Miss Stevens?
Just a moment, I'll
get her for you.
Thank you.
Hello, Johnny.
Well, hello Mona.
It's nice to see you.
I... I hope I didn't
inconvenience you asking you
To come over here.
Not at all.
I didn't know you
were working here.
I wouldn't have bothered you,
Johnny unless it was absolutely
Necessary.
Oh, I know that.
What is it?
It's Mac.
I don't know what to about him.
What's he done?
He's around all the time.
He comes here.
He comes to my apartment.
He just won't leave me alone.
I've even had to ask one of the
floor walkers to take me home.
Why didn't you tell me Before
I thought I could
discourage him.
I even threatened
to call the police.
He said if I did,
he'd... go to your wife.
He knows I don't want
to cause you any trouble
And he's holding
it over my head.
Oh, that's it.
Well, I'm glad you told me.
I'll have a talk with him.
Everything else all right?
Everything's fine.
Be careful, Johnny.
I will.
He won't bother you anymore.
Thanks.
Good bye.
Good bye.
Where's MacDonald?
He's gone for the day.
Where will I find him?
How should I know?
Maybe he's gone home.
Any message?
[DOORBELL]
This is just a warning, Mac.
If you're real smart,
you'll take it seriously.
Leave the girl alone.
Stay away from her.
And if I ever hear
that you've threatened
To do anything about my family
again, I'll kill you, Mac.
I mean that.
There you are, sir.
Next pass, please.
Why should you bother?
What's this mean to you?
It doesn't mean a thing to me.
I just don't like to see
a guy get a bad deal.
Who's getting a bad deal?
Look, I was the
insurance investigator.
I met your girl.
I know all about Forbes.
What are you talking about?
Who's Forbes?
I'm telling you.
Forbes was the insurance man.
He's a nice looking guy.
I guess your girl kind
of took a fancy to him.
What are you trying to tell me?
Nothing at all, pal.
You better calm down.
I just don't like to see
anyone get a raw deal.
Where did you meet my girl?
I told you.
I was the insurance
investigator.
How do you know so much?
Anyway, so what if it's true?
What am I supposed to do?
Bust out of here?
I didn't mean to
get you so upset.
Or didn't you?
Then what are you doing here?
Who's Forbes and who are you?
And how do you know so much?
I guess I better go.
I guess you better.
Leave me alone.
I was just trying to give
you a break, that's all.
Don't do me any favors.
I don't even know you.
Anyway, how do I know
you're not lying?
You don't.
So long, pal.
Terry, may I borrow
your car this afternoon?
Sure.
Going to the beach?
It's a lovely day.
No, I thought I'd
go see Bill Smiley.
Again?
I thought that was
all over, Mona.
He's getting out tomorrow.
We have some plans to make.
Aren't you making a mistake...
Starting that up again?
I've been thinking
we might as well try
To make some sort of
life for ourselves.
I don't understand.
I thought there
was someone else.
As a matter of fact...
There isn't anyone else.
Well, well, well.
Back to see the boyfriend?
Oh, it's just that I'd
rather spend the afternoon
Here than on a
hot, stuffy beach.
I thought maybe you were sort
of getting interested in me.
Women have done it
before, you know.
Women have taken poison
before, but that's
No recommendation for poison.
She's right, you know.
Yeah.
Hello, Bill.
I've got it all
figured out, Bill.
You're getting out tomorrow.
I think we ought
to get out of town.
What do think about that, Bill?
What do you think
about leaving town?
Who's Forbes?
What are you talking about?
And who's this guy who's
been coming to see me?
MacDonald.
Who is he?
What do you mean he's
been coming to see you?
He's been driving me crazy.
Who is he?
Who is this Forbes he
keeps talking about?
Look, Bill, Let's
not get tangled up
In a lot of things
that don't matter.
Don't matter to who?
Who is this guy who
keeps coming to see me?
Anything he tells you, Bill.
Don't pay any attention to him.
It doesn't matter.
What do you mean
it doesn't matter?
I got to sit here 24 hours
every day and think about it.
Who is he?
He's someone who was
quite interested in me.
I wouldn't have
anything to do with him.
He's sore about it.
That's why he's bothering you.
That's great.
I sit in jail... I don't
know who this guy is.
He's making a play for you.
He comes to me with some
story about somebody
With the name of Forbes,
I... where's your ring?
I gave it back, Bill.
That's why you're
getting out tomorrow.
I give all the things back.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
I sit here sweating it out
to give you some things
And you take them back?
Maybe that guy,
whoever he is is right.
He could be wrong, too.
We'll see.
I want to find out
about a lot of things.
There's a lot of
things I want to know.
Oh hello.
For a girl who asked
you to stay away from me
I call you up an awful lot.
That's all right.
Is Mac bothering you again?
Not me... Smiley.
What do you mean?
He's been getting into jail to
see Smiley, I don't know how.
He used to be on
the police force.
He told Smiley all about us.
Mac's been needling him until
he's almost out of his mind.
Oh.
I'm sorry, Johnny.
You're sorry?
You couldn't help it.
How long is this going on?
I sort of thought the
whole thing was finished.
If you don't mind, it isn't
exactly easy on me, either.
I sort of figured it was
half your problem, too.
What do you want me to do?
I don't want you
to do anything.
I needed someone to talk to.
I thought you were the one.
You want me to talk to him?
Wouldn't do any good.
When is he getting out?
Tomorrow.
I don't want him to
get into any trouble
And I don't want him to
ruin anything for you.
He won't ruin anything for me.
I'm sorry I
bothered you, Johnny.
I just thought
you ought to know.
Thanks, Mona.
Maggie, see if
Mr. Brawley is in.
I want to talk with him.
Sounds very much like a
case of temporary insanity.
You take a chance of losing
your family, your job, for what?
I've already asked myself
that question several times.
What do I do now?
Tell Sue?
You most certainly do not.
You've got something eating
away at your conscience.
And if you think
you're going to ease it
By making her life
miserable, you've
Got another thing coming.
Supposing she finds out.
Would it be better
coming from me?
You can't change anything
that's happened by telling her.
I assume you're still
interested in keeping
Your marriage together?
You know I am.
I'd do anything.
You've done too much already.
John, you want to have
your head beaten in?
I already have.
Eh, I don't know what to say.
Do you want to go to the police?
I'm not interested in
telling this to anybody else.
Do you want to
take Sue and Tommy
And get out of town for a while?
What good would that do?
I have to face it sometime.
You know, I don't know why
I bothered to tell you.
I don't either.
You know I don't mean that.
I'll do everything I can.
We'll think of something.
We'd better.
How does it feel to be a
decent, respectable married man?
Johnny?
Johnny?
Yeah?
You want to talk about it?
Talk about what?
Whatever's on your mind.
You've been reading the same
page of that paper for an hour.
Something's been
troubling you for weeks.
Don't you think I know?
Listen, Johnny.
Either it's a
marriage or it isn't.
If you have any troubles,
they're half mine.
Maybe you wouldn't
want half of them?
Whether I want them or
not, I have a right to them.
Yeah, I guess you do at that.
After all, nothing's
too tough for us.
We won the war together.
You brought Tommy
through pneumonia.
What is it, Johnny?
Sue, I... I don't
know to tell you.
I...
TOMMY (OFFSCREEN): Daddy!
Mother!
Daddy!
Mother!
Daddy!
Mother!
Daddy!
Mother!
Mother!
Oh, honey.
What's the matter?
I'm scared.
Oh, scared of what?
He's soaking wet.
I saw something.
Here, come here.
He probably had a nightmare.
What'd you see, fella?
I don't know.
Something was coming after me.
Oh, now nothing was
coming after you.
It was too!
I saw it.
Where?
I don't know.
Coming in the window, I guess.
Nothing was coming
in the window.
See?
There's nothing out there.
You just had a bad dream.
Is this what you were
reading before you
Went to sleep tonight?
Yes.
When I was a kid it
was too much supper.
Now it's comic books.
Where does he get this stuff?
Grandma sent them to me.
They were for his birthday.
I'll burn them tomorrow.
No!
While you're at it,
singe her a little, too.
I'd love to, darling.
It was your mother this time.
Oh.
Everything under
control, Chief?
I think so.
Daddy, what makes a dream?
Well, the mind mostly.
There mind is like a
very wonderful camera.
You know how a camera works?
Sure.
It takes pictures.
That's right.
That's the way the mind works.
Evidently, from the
day we were born,
The mind takes pictures
and stores them away.
Now and then, one
of those pictures
Comes loose in our sleep
and that becomes a dream.
So the trick is take
only good pictures
And have only good dreams.
I think he's asleep.
He'll be all right now.
You want me to
fix you something?
No thanks.
I'm not hungry.
I'll just drink this milk.
You know, sometimes I'm
awfully proud of myself
Why?
For giving Tommy such
a wonderful father.
He thinks you're the
greatest guy on earth.
He could be wrong.
My son is never wrong.
What were you going
to tell me upstairs?
You know, I believe I
could be something at that.
Maybe some eggs.
So you don't want
to talk about it?
It'll be all right, Sue.
It isn't important.
It's something that
can be altered.
Yeah?
My name is Forbes.
I want to see one
of your prisoners.
Smiley, a William Smiley.
What do you want
to see him about?
I'm from the Olympic
Mutual Insurance Company.
He was involved in one
of our bonding policies.
Isn't that funny?
He was let out at 8:00 this
morning and he left with you.
Only at 8:00 this morning
you were a dark, fat guy
And your name was MacDonald.
Oh, thanks.
Ain't we whimsical today?
You like working for the city?
Shut up.
MacDonald around?
Nope.
Expect him?
No, he took the day off.
Thanks.
Close that door.
Oh.
Hi.
Celebrating?
I don't blame you.
We'll really do
the town tonight.
How about a drink for me?
Sure.
I didn't know what time
you were getting out
Or I would have been
there to meet you.
That would have been nice.
It's sort of funny, isn't it?
What?
Looking at each other like this
without a screen between us.
Maybe it was better
when it was only screen.
Well, I guess if you
don't want to kiss me
I can't twist your arm.
Who says I don't.
Do they give one to
everyone who's getting out?
A friend of yours was kind
enough to lend it to me.
If they caught you
even carrying this
You'd be back in there for good.
You seem to get along
all right without me.
Don't believe
everything you hear.
I don't believe anything.
I want you to tell me.
This MacDonald...
What's his angle?
Why does he hop me all up on
booze and then give me a gun?
Bill, we've got a chance
to build a decent life.
Now if you get into trouble
again, we won't have anything.
Why should I get in trouble?
Why should I get in trouble?
You don't know Mac.
How do you know him?
He was after me, Bill.
He'll do anything.
Why does he want
me to kill Forbes?
He's jealous of him.
Is he jealous of him?
Why does he have any reason
to be jealous of Forbes?
It's all over now, Bill.
It never amounted
to anything, really.
In order for something to be
over it's got to start first.
We all make mistakes, Bill.
You made one.
For you.
Don't tell me you
did this for me.
All right.
I was wrong.
Didn't you ever hear
of forgiving anyone?
You I can forgive.
That guy, no.
He takes back the things
I'm sweating out a jail
Rap to get for you...
And then he takes you.
It wasn't that
way at all, Bill.
We'll see.
Bill, please.
Please!
And then as they came around
the corner, John and Ted,
The fun loving Busbys came upon
an ancient grizzled mountain
Lion.
With perfect coordination,
the two boys dove for shelter.
Why didn't they
use the ray guns?
These are the Busby boys.
They don't have ray guns.
They use slingshots.
Dopes.
Really Sue, I'm
getting awfully worried
About that terrible
trash he reads...
Torturing women, men from Mars.
All right, darling
but even I can't
Stand much more of the
Busby boys tonight.
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
I'll get it.
Hello?
Johnny, this is Mona.
Has Smiley been there?
Here?
No.
Why?
He got out today.
I know that.
I've been with him all day.
He's very belligerent.
Mac gave him a gun.
He's been threatening
to go over to see you.
He ran out of the apartment
this afternoon but I found him.
Where is he now?
I don't know.
We were in a little bar.
He's been drinking.
I went to call a
cab and he ran out.
I came right back to the
apartment and he isn't here.
All right.
I'll watch out for him.
I don't want him hurt, Johnny.
I don't want him
thrown back in jail.
I'll take care of him.
I'll come right over.
You stay right where you are.
Johnny, I know
how to handle him.
Now look, you know you
can't come over here.
You stay right there
and I'll call you
After I've talked to him.
Who was it?
Nobody.
Chief, how'd you like
to go to a picture show?
I mean it.
Get up.
Get dressed.
Johnny are you
out of your mind?
It's almost 9:00.
We can get the last show.
Sure!
I don't know what's
come over you.
We're not going to
any show tonight.
Get back in bed.
Oh, Mom.
Here.
Johnny, what's the
matter with you?
Well, it... there's a man
coming out from the office.
I wanted to talk with him alone.
Well, we've got more than
one room in the house.
You can talk to him downstairs.
All right.
Chief, what are you
doing down here?
You didn't say
good night to me.
Oh, good night, Son.
Now go on upstairs.
Aren't you scared with
all these lights out?
Son, don't ask questions.
Go upstairs, will you?
I'm sorry we couldn't
go to the movies.
I want you to know something.
I'll go to the movies any time
you want me to go with you.
Thanks, Son.
Good night.
Good night, Dad.
[DOOR SLAMS]
[FOOTSTEPS]
[POUNDING ON DOOR]
Get out of here, Smiley.
Are you Forbes?
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Why not not?
You're drunk.
How do you know?
Give us both a break.
Get going.
Did Mona tell you I was coming?
I'm not kidding.
Get moving.
And stay away from here.
[CAR ENGINE]
[GLASS BREAKS]
[GUNSHOTS]
Tommy, you get right back
in your room and stay there.
Johnny?
Johnny?
Sue.
Johnny what happened?
Are you all right?
Sue you better call the police.
I just killed a man.
What's the matter, Mona?
Having a little trouble?
POLICE SCANNER: Unit
12T, ambulance traffic,
Hollywood and Vine.
12T ambulance traffic,
Hollywood and Vine.
Nervous?
Why don't you get out of here?
POLICE SCANNER: Unit 11 A
at 390 Downs, Santa Monica
And Las Palmas.
Unit 11A at 390 Downs, at
Santa Monica and Las Palmas.
Just a drunk in Las Palmas.
Nothing to get upset about.
POLICE SCANNER: Unit 11
A, 390 Downs, Santa Monica
And Las Palmas.
Unit 11A at 390 Downs,
Santa Monica and Las Palmas.
Why doesn't Johnny call?
Maybe he can't.
I'll give you my word, Mac.
If anything happens
to either one of them,
I'll see that the police
get the whole story on you.
What did I do?
You gave Smiley the gun.
Who said so?
He says so.
Anyway, don't you think
they can trace it to you?
Not unless they're
a lot smarter than
They were when I
was on the force.
POLICE SCANNER: All
units in the vicinity
Of 5424 Bradna
Drive, code three.
All units in the vicinity of
5424 Bradna Drive, code three.
That's Johnny's address.
Yeah, sure.
POLICE SCANNER: All
units in the vicinity
Of 5424 Bradna
Drive, code three.
What is it?
Homicide
POLICE SCANNER: All
units in the vicinity
Of 5424 Bradna
Drive, code three.
Don't go over there.
Besides, you don't know
what you're running into.
Somebody's been
shot but you don't
Know whether it's Smiley,
Johnny, or Johnny's wife.
There's an easier way.
Wait a minute.
POLICE SCANNER: All units
in the vicinity of...
Lieutenant Howes, please.
Hello, Fred.
This is MacDonald.
Yeah, fine thanks.
Say, I was just riding down
Bradna Drive, 400 block.
Saw a big commotion over there.
I wondered if you
had anything on it.
Yeah, thanks.
You were going to who
and tell them about me?
Yeah, Fred.
Uh huh.
Yeah, I see.
A prowler?
Anybody hurt?
Uh huh.
Yeah.
I see.
All right.
Yeah, thanks Freddy.
I just thought there might
be something in it for me.
Yeah, thanks.
What is it, Mac?
Smiley.
How do you like that Johnny?
He told them Smiley
was a prowler.
What happened to Johnny?
Maybe we'll read about
it in the papers tomorrow.
But you better start
thinking about yourself.
We'll take a car
trip for a few days.
I know how you feel about this.
Yeah, where are your bags?
We'll get you packed.
Now it's funny.
I didn't figure it would
work out this well.
I thought they'd throw
a scare into each other.
Imagine Johnny killing him.
You'd think he had more sense.
You'll have to help me a
little with this packing.
Smiley wasn't a bad guy.
Never hurt anyone really.
Of course he didn't.
Didn't hurt anyone,
didn't help anyone.
He wasn't anything.
He was a nice guy.
It wasn't enough.
For who?
Me.
People were born to
have certain things.
Smiley didn't have the nerve and
Forbes didn't have the chance.
So it's me you end up with.
I think we'll spend a few
days in San Francisco.
Then we'll cut across to Reno.
Do you like gambling, Mona?
You know, I'm a
great gambler, Mona.
But what's more important...
I'm a lucky gambler.
Look at the thing
tonight, for instance.
It was 1,000 to one shot I'd
get rid of both of them at once.
You'll forget about
Smiley in a few days.
You don't think so
now, but you will.
You haven't thought about
yet but when you do,
You'll realize the
only reason I did
All this was because
I... I really love you.
[GUNSHOT]
[GUNSHOT]
Tell the boys to get the
specs from him, will you?
Get all the
information you needed?
I'll be through in a minute.
Hurry it up.
I'd like to go home
before midnight.
I haven't had a decent
night's sleep in weeks.
I haven't either.
How about you?
OK.
Button it up, will you?
Well, Mr. Forbes we're
about ready to go.
There will be a few
routine questions
That we'll have to ask
you so keep yourself
Available for the
coroner's inquest.
Thanks a lot.
You've been very cooperative.
Good night.
We're leaving now, Mr. Forbes.
Better have somebody
board up that window.
Good night.
Good night.
Johnny, I know how terrible
you must feel about this,
But the important thing
is that you weren't hurt.
It could have been
so much worse.
There's not going
to be any trouble.
Try to forget about it, Johnny.
Please, try.
I'll fix you a cup of coffee.
Sue, forget about the coffee.
I want to talk with you.
Sit down, Sue.
I got to get this off of
my mind or I'll go crazy.
I've been covering
one lie with another
Until I'm nearly out of my mind.
This man I killed tonight...
He wasn't a prowler.
I knew he was coming.
That's why I wanted you
and Tommy out of the house.
He had good reasons for
wanting to kill me, Sue.
Better reasons that I
had for killing him.
Well, why should
anyone want to kill you?
Because of his girl.
I met her on a case a
couple of months ago.
She was the one who phoned
and told me he was coming.
What about this girl?
This man Smiley just got out
of jail today and somebody
Told him a lot of
things about her and me.
Were they true?
Yes.
I don't know what I
could possibly say.
I can't give you an explanation.
I wanted to tell
you... I... I tried.
Sue, say something.
Please say something!
I can't go on with
this on my conscience!
Conscience!
You make it sound
like a dirty word.
You worrying about your
filthy little conscience.
I've got my son to think about.
I thought about
that too and ended up
By covering one lie after
another and now a man is dead.
I can't lie anymore!
I wanted you to know
before I went to the police.
You're not going to the police.
You lied once.
It came easy enough
for you then.
You've got to lie now.
I mean this, Johnny.
If you drag this family
through the dirt,
I'll never forgive you.
I was just reading
about it, Mr. Forbes.
Yeah.
I guess we hit all the papers.
I didn't think
you'd be in today.
Might as well be
here as anywhere.
You're in awfully
early, aren't you?
Early to bed, early to rise.
There are a couple of men
from the district attorney's
Office waiting inside.
All right.
Mr. Forbes?
Yeah.
We're from the district
attorney's office.
I know.
There's a couple
of questions would
Like to ask you about
last night, Mr. Forbes.
Look, I've decided to make
a full statement on the case.
Quite a few things I didn't
tell the police last night.
Maybe we'd better go down to
the district attorney's office.
Let's go.
When he arrived the first
time, I... I chased him away.
He came back, broke
in the window.
I knew he had a gun.
I had to kill him.
You wouldn't have
had to if you'd
Called the police
in the first place.
I've explained
to you the reasons
I felt I couldn't do that.
Reasons... they make a lot
of sense now, don't they?
Well, it all checks.
Your statement, the report
of our investigator,
The statement Miss
Stevens gave us.
Mona Stevens has been here?
She's here now
upstairs, under arrest.
For what?
That depends on MacDonald.
She shot him.
If he dies, it's one thing.
If he doesn't it's another.
Can I talk her?
Nobody can talk to her.
Go on, get out of here.
I'd like to hold you, all right?
Personally, I think we've got
the wrong person in the cell
Upstairs.
There's nothing I
can do about it.
It so happens the homicide
you committed was justifiable.
Bill Smiley was
coming to kill you.
Just a little call
to the police and you
Could have avoided
all this mess.
But no.
You kill a man.
And that's not a
pleasant thing to live
With for the rest of your life.
Or don't things like
that bother you?
Go on.
Get out of here.
Down.
Down.
[HONKING]
How did you know I was here?
I phoned.
I'm taking Tommy out of school.
I suppose that's best.
How much does he know
about everything?
You can't expect to keep too
much from a child of his age.
I think you should ask Ed for
transfer to some other town.
Are you sure you don't
want a divorce, Sue?
I've thought about it.
There's no use kidding you.
I've thought about it a lot.
I almost made up my mind.
And then I got to thinking...
If a man has always
Been a good husband except
for 24 hours, how long
Should he be expected
to pay for it?
I don't know, Sue.
I suppose some people
would say forever.
I'm not sure it will
ever be the same... not
For a long time anyway.
But we've weathered
other things.
Maybe we can handle this.
That's of course
if you want to try.
Of course I do.
All right.
That's what we'll do then.
We'll try.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
