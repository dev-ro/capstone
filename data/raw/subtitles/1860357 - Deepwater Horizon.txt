Can I have everyone's attention?
Mr. Williams, please rise.
Please raise your right hand, Sir.
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony
you are about to give is the truth,
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?
- Yes, Sir.
- Thank you, Sir, please be seated.
Mr. Williams, can you please give us your best
recollection of the event on the Deepwater Horizon?
I was on the phone around
9:30 with my wife.
That's when I heard the hissing noise.
I heard the engines start to rev.
The hissing turned into a full-blown roar,
higher than I can even describe it,
and within seconds there
was a huge explosion,
projectiles coming from everywhere.
The heat was overwhelming.
Can you please explain to me how the
Deepwater Horizon's alarm system is set up?
The general alarm is set
up to inform the entire rig
of number one: Fire; Number
two: Combustible gas;
Three: Toxic gas.
Each condition has a distinct tone
Siren and a distinct visual light.
On the evening of April 20th
did you hear any one of those
alarms on the Deepwater Horizon?
No, Sir.
Do you know why you never
heard the alarm, Sir?
Mr. Williams?
Mr. Williams!
Passing through 3,000 feet.
Continuing down.
And stick to the north side.
Scan on it.
Minor corrosion, not much more than
I'd expect on a weld of this age.
I just had the craziest dream.
Oh, wow, was I in it?
I was... No. I was at a concert...
and then on the side of the
stage there was this...
like, a two legged rabbit.
I don't know what part in that I play.
Listen to me.
Listen.
I would move...
and then it would mimic
everything I was doing.
Don't tell me anymore because
I know where this is going.
- I think the rabbit was my mother.
- Mother, yes, I know.
Thank you, now it's my nightmare,
thank you.
- It was hostile.
- Okay.
- A hostile rabbit.
- Okay, I got it.
I'm sorry, what are you doin'?
That's it? That's how you're gonna
leave me for 21 days and nights?
I'm letting you get your sleep.
Well, I need... I need other
things besides sleep.
You need to promise not to
bring up your mother, then.
Huh?
You want the 30?
The 60?
Or the 90 second love package?
I'm gonna take the whole 90.
The pressure, the pressure,
the pressure, the pressure!
And I'd miss that laugh.
- I'd miss that mouth.
- What mouth?
Give me those eyes.
Love you.
This is not our deal.
All right! All right!
You consistently overestimate
your skills as a mechanic.
What was that?
Let's go baby.
Let me drive.
- Let me drive.
- Nope.
Pretty please?
- You really want to drive?
- Yeah.
Then sell that piece of
shit and get a Ducati.
Wow! A bull in a china shop.
I only did not knock
because I want a brother.
Okay, well, that's disturbing.
Because you're not supposed to know anything about
that, you're supposed to just think babies are cute.
- Loud!
- Will you sit down, please.
I really want a brother.
- How's it goin'?
- Fine.
- Honey, show Daddy.
- I'm not done.
- You did such a good job.
- It's show time.
It's really great.
You can't look at me.
- Why?
- 'Cause it makes me uncomfortable.
- My lookin' at you makes you uncomfortable?
- Stop!
- All right.
- My dad is Mike.
He works on a drilling rig that pumps
oil out from underneath the ocean.
No, no, the Deepwater doesn't pump a drop
of oil, okay, Baby, we're the explorers.
So, my dad and his friends find the oil
and then put in all the plumbing so
other lamer crews can come in...
- Don't say "Lamer"
- They are lamer.
But listen, even those lamer dudes,
they don't have to pump anything, remember?
Because oil wants to come rushing up...
Because that oil is a monster.
Like the mean,
old dinosaurs all that oil used to be.
So, for 300 million years
these old dinosaurs have been getting pretty
tighter, and tighter, and tighter, and tighter...
We get it, we get it,
just do two "tighters".
Because they have miles of earth
and ocean pressing down on them...
They are trapped.
Then Dad and his friends
make a hole in their roof.
Yeah!
And these mean,
old dinosaurs can't believe it.
So they rush to the new hole, then SMACK!
They run into a big machine
that he and his friends...
have down on the ocean
floor called a...
- Big guy preventer?
- Blowout preventer.
They run into this stuff called "mud"...
- All right, get it in there.
- And they cram down the straw.
The mud's so thick and heavy it
blocks the monsters from coming up.
And then they sail away to the next.
That's when all the lamos show up
happy like they did something.
Don't say "Lamo".
But it was my Daddy who
tamed the dinosaurs.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
That was amazing,
stay forever 10 years, please.
Daddy, you need to get me a fossil.
- Oh, yeah.
- I will.
I want to be able to hold it up and say,
"My Daddy tamed the dinosaurs".
Tell Daddy what Maggie's dad did.
Her dad works at the zoo,
and he brought a really penguin.
He can't do that!
- He brought in a penguin.
- How do you compete with a penguin?
- You get a fossil.
- There should be rules!
Oh my gosh!
What?
Stop it!
Buy gas, go to work...
buy gas, go back to work...
to buy more gas to GET to work.
Do you know the passwords, right, for the
insurance companies? Where is the safe?
- To call Schuman first?
- What are you talking about?
I just...
- When were you...
- I got a little spooked on the Goman last hit, it's just not...
Give me some of that.
Babe, the only time you start worrying
about a Marine is when he stops bitching.
- Don't use my lines against me.
- I'm using your lines against you.
- Don't use my lines!
- I just did.
- All right, Bread.
- All right, Fish.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- See you in three weeks.
- Right, three weeks..
Behave.
Next!
- Good morning, Mr. Jimmy.
- How we doin', Sarah?
- Good, how are you?
- I'm good.
Place your bags on the baggage scale
and step on the feet.
- Where you headed today?
- Same place, Deepwater Horizon.
- Where you flyin' off to?
- Deepwater Horizon.
- And who do you work for?
- Transocean.
- You wanna know how much you weigh?
- You know I do.
- 181.
- What did I tell you?
- Yeah, you did good, keep it that way.
- All right.
All right, have a seat in the lobby and
we'll call you when your flights ready.
- Thank you.
- Mr. Sims? Mr. O'Bryan?
David Sims.
Jimmy Harrell, officer
installation manager on Deepwater.
Palani, thank you very much
for taking us out today,
I know you guys are swamped
and you didn't have to.
Well, I had to.
Listen, do you mind losin' that tie?
I would.
It's not the tie, it's the color.
Purple?
More magenta.
And?
Well, magenta alarm on an
oil rig is as bad as it gets.
As worthy of superstitions.
- Mornin'.
- Mike Williams.
- Where you headed today?
- Deepwater Horizon.
What do you do on your down time?
- I started workin' on that air boat again.
- Yeah?
I'm upin' it to 600
horsepower to 1200 horsepower.
And I got me a little Sensenich
prop offset supercut.
- You tryin' to make it fly?
- No, I just wanna make it go faster.
- Loud and clear.
- Roger, go everyone.
Boscow, I got the Deepwater
Horizon coordinates in the F.M.S.
492, your tower's clear, wind is calm.
Paris Control, this is
Bristow Two Bravo Gulf,
we're headed out into open ocean.
E.T.A. 45 minutes to Deepwater Horizon.
Roger that, Bristow Two Bravo Gulf.
What is it you do at B.P., Mr. Sims?
- Competition.
- Oh, shit, here we go, Jimmy.
Well, you know, we... we a little behind.
Forty-three days, but
who's counting, right?
- What were you gonna do with your bonus, Mike?
- Dig a pool.
- You?
- Fix my car.
You know the first well collapsed on her,
took us five days just to pull
a million dollar drill pipe out?
- Whose fault was that?
- Whatchya drivin'?
- '69 Mustang.
- Fastback?
- Vinyl top.
- What's up with it?
Today it was a rough idle, made the exhaust
smell like gas right out of the pump.
- Do you smell gas when it's not runnin'?
- No, so it's not a leak in the tank.
Shit!
That was a bird strike, folks.
I didn't say nothin'.
Deepwater Horizon is only a mile now.
We should be fine to land.
We'll run a safety check then.
Anything that big oughta be made by God.
That's beautiful.
You know it's not on stilts?
It's not jacked up.
Yeah, I do, and I still can't
believe that thing's a boat.
Well, you can thank this very talented
young lady right back here for that.
What the hell is the Bankston doin' here?
Who gave that order?
Standby Bravo Gulf, permission
to land Deepwater Horizon.
Welcome aboard!
You guys already done?
I don't know what to tell you, Mr. Jimmy.
- You guys finished?
- I don't know what to tell ya.
- Someone's gotta talk to Vidrine.
- What? Are you finished?
- Hey, Skip.
- Yes Sir.
- Team is leaving?
- Yes, Schlumberger down, they're gone.
Skip, are we done here?
- You gotta talk to Vidrine.
- Vidrine?
- What did he say?
- I can't hear him.
What did Mr. Skip said?
Stay with the boat and see
if the cement is holding.
I guess they left without doing it.
What?
- BP says to send the guys home.
- Seriously?
Yep.
Kuchta, why is the Bankston here?
- Good day to you, too.
- What is the Bankston doin' here?
Good morning, Pete.
Happy to see me?
I'm always happy to see you, Andrea.
Where's the restroom, Williams?
The sign that says "toilet".
- Skip saying anything about doin' a cement log?
- He didn't tell me.
Did we win the war here and I'm
just now findin' out about it?
Because I sure as hell don't
know how they'd have the
time to do the cement test,
because they're flyin' away.
- Hey, Jimmy, I just drive the boat, man.
- How did the positive test go?
Well, we're in the breakdown mode.
- Breakdown mode?
- How we looking?
Sittin' at 166, winds are
at 185 at around 5 knots.
Seas are calm, that's good.
Holding grade of our watch,
echo sittin' right on top.
You still datin' that itty-bitty
guy with the motorcycle?
- Any issues with the ???
- Andrea.
Yes Sir?
Get on the radio to Captain Landry on the
Bankston and see what he's doin' and why.
Aye. Aye, Mr. Jimmy.
Damon Bankston this is
Deepwater Horizon, over.
Deepwater Horizon, this
Damon Bankston, go ahead.
The O.I.M. wants to know
what you're doin' here.
I hear we're gettin' off this
beast and movin' onto the next.
You can call her "beast".
When is your boat leavin'?
Well, I'm told to be ready to start
takin' on drilling mud at about 18 hundred.
Wow.
I heard you have a positive
pressure test this mornin'.
I guess they assume that the
negative test is gonna run just as smooth.
- They told me to get ready to start movin' on.
- Who's "they"?
BP company man.
Vidrine, Kaluza, I don't know.
I wait for the order and come pick
up your mud. Any other question?
Nope, that's it.
So, BP comes in here, Vidrine and/or Kaluza
are hoping that we have tamed this bitch
and are ready to? Drilling mud 18
hundred hours, is that correct, Captain?
That is correct...
good morning, Mr. Jimmy.
All of a sudden, just like that?
Thank you, Captain.
Damn! The god damn phones
still don't work, Mike.
Hey, I flew in with you, Mr. Jimmy.
Do me a favor,
run down to the drill shack,
ask Jason if those Schlumberger guys did
their job; Did they run the cement log.
Roger that.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, you couldn't perhaps enlighten
me on this cement log situation, could ya?
Cement log?
Do you know if they're
plannin' it? Runnin' it? Did it?
Yeah.
Not really... hey, Ronnie.
Might be a missing
problem with your Mustang.
I'm thinkin' fouled plugs.
It could be a wire, could
be the distributor.
- Does is sounds like it's skippin'?
- Nope.
You know what I'm gonna do for ya,
young lady,
I'm gonna keep thinking about all these expensive
things that could be wrong with your ride. Damaged.
- Gee, thanks.
- Hey.
Stick shift of automatic?
Do you know me?
Oh, we gonna stops grindin' shit
oughta that clutch, I know that.
- Oh, yeah, Mr. Toyota.
- Uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh.
Code red, code red.
Come movin', baby, come
movin', baby, c'mon.
Release 400 barrels of mud.
Roger that, beginning actuation.
Shut up.
Hey! Duck!
What's up, Mike?
- How you doin', Caleb?
- Hey, Mike, how ya doin, man?
- A lot better a coupla hours ago.
- Why's that?
I was asleep.
Yeah?
Yeah, we all got woken
up, they got us work over.
We got a lot of pipe to pull if we're
gonna get out of here tonight.
Street clothes? You look pretty.
Oh, man, listen, Jimmy's pissed and
what's more, we gotta cement log test.
I'm not sure, I don't think so.
- No? Hey, Shane!
- Yeah?
Come here, boy, Schlumberger
run a cement log test?
I don't know, I don't think they
did it, I just woke up, so...
- Is that stupid?
- I don't know if it's stupid, but...
but it ain't smart.
- But it ain't smart.
- But it ain't smart.
Look at you guys, like
synchronized swimmers.
I think you think too much,
you gonna give him a headache.
I understand that.
- Hey, fellas.
- What the hell are you wearin'?
Mr. Jimmy wants to know if you've
seen the Schlumburger cement bond tests.
The what?
The cement job, test the cement job,
c'mon, man, work with me.
- Whose that again?
- Ah, cut the shit, man!
- C'mon, Jimmy's pissed, man.
- Schlumburger, you democrat.
- Well, did we run the test?
- No, Vidrine flew the... Home without testing anything.
Well, why in the hell would they do that?
They never feel the urge to take
me through their thinkin', Mike.
But I assume it's got somethin' to do
with... money, money, money, money.
Money.
Your phones are broken.
- Hey, Mr. Jimmy.
<I>- Go ahead.
That BP sent Schlumberger team home
without runnin' any tests.
Thank you, Mike.
Mike, A? Just crashed.
- Blue screen of death... again.
- Hey, Duck, is your? Still up?
My computer screen is shaky,
and the smoke detector's out.
How you doin', Mike? Shit.
- I'm doublin' back to grab my tools, I'll be to fix it.
- Doin' it all with Band-Aids and bubble gum, my man.
Every time I peel off a Band-Aid on this rig I find 3
or 4 more... spit and glue ain’t gettin' it done.
One more time with the "money"... c'mon,
c'mon, you been rehearsin' for weeks.
- No, no, the good part, man.
- It is the good part.
Hi, Hollywood!
- Mike!
- Mornin', Dale?
- Let me know when you're done.
- Not much, could be.
He ain't goin' fishin' tonight.
A hundred dollars.
I got a feeling we're gettin' off this well tonight,
I don't see nobody could be doin' no fishin'.
You gonna use your crane, man,
maybe catch a Beluga or a Shamu?
Good idea... shit.
Wanna make a bet we're here
on the same spot next shift?
- Yeah, give me odds?
- Three to one.
Ah, shit.
- I ain't touchin' that.
- Three to one, same spot.
- No way.
- Mike Williams, you piece of shit.!
- Patrick.
- So what, Mike?
- I heard we're done.
- You heard we were done?
- Yeah, I heard we're done.
- Well, who did you hear that from?
- I can't tell you 'bout that, Mike.
- What do you mean you can't tell me 'bout it?
I can't tell you 'bout it.
I just can't tell you, but I can tell
you that Gordon is looking for ya.
- Did Gordon tell you what was up?
- Naw, he didn't tell me that.
- Well, what is goin' on?
- I don't know, he's got somethin' to show ya.
- What DO you know?
- I know we're done.
- Were you in the shop?
- No.
- Don't touch my shit.
- I wasn't touchin' your shit.
- All right, go fix somethin'!
- All right, have a wonderful time.
- Have a good day, Mike.
- Yeah, you too... shit.
<I>...Baby, hold on.
What did you say?
Great news: The chopper didn't crash.
<I>I assumed and then I reneged.
Oh, yeah, he rich?
Remember what your mama always said:
"Just as easily to marry a rich man..."
If I had a nickel for the
dumb shit for my mom's?
I wouldn't need a rich man.
You better fix this, by the way.
I'm gonna fix it just as soon
as I get home, don't worry.
Hey, come closer to the computer.
Come over to the computer.
<I>- Look at those eyes.
- How is it out there?
Same shit, well from hell.
- Are you ready?
- Ready.
<I>- Three.
- Two.
<I>- One.
- Go!
<I>... sociopath.
That is focus, that is determination,
that is intensity... drive.
I hate it.
<I>See you soon, okay?
All right, see ya.
touchin' my shit! This is my shit!
My shit!
- Ken said he didn't want to say it's our next location.
- Kaskida.
Was this run by anybody at BP?
Kaluza, Vidrine, anybody?
Vidrine right about me, he's...
this comes from Vidrine.
Bob, let me impose upon you what
I think is most important here.
We need to go from Macondo
to Kaskida on May 16.
Kaskida is an uncommon prospect,
three to four billion barrels,
that's worth more than BP itself.
Do I look like fuckin' Santa Claus?
You DO look a little like Santa Claus.
Couch Miles may have played in Michigan,
but that boy got Louisiana soul.
- Saban?
- We win, we win.
"We"?Like you went to 'Bama?
When I was potty trained, I was about to
flush, wave and say, "See you in Tuscaloosa."
Hey, you boys workin' for the Company?
Clean the Clean room!
We're still findin' mud from the last kick.
Over 5,000 psi, grab a mop!
- This is crazy.
- Look what the pressure did to drill? During the kick.
That's one for the trophy case.
Hey, Patrick said you got something for me.
Yes, Sir, station 4 broke down...
and I finally found the source
of the problem, check this out.
I've been hidin' this for
you since the last kick.
Is that a tooth?
My little girl's ear.
And her old man, thank you, I owe you, man.
- They sent them home.
- Yeah.
Walk with me, Mike.
- Where we headed.
- To murder some BP Company men.
Shit, I got hammers, screwdrivers.
- Say, Mike, you brush your teeth this morning?
- Why yes, Sir.
- Did you floss?
- No, no, why?
Saves you a lot of pain and
money in the long run, I'll tell ya.
Shit! Jimmy's... BP guy.
Sent them home... doin' shit...
now we're goin' after BP.
What's that matter? Well, you owe 'em a
lot of money? C'mon, Mike, stay on my hip!
Yeah, baby.
Line 51, you don't
see any cost variances.
Well if it isn't Don Vidrine
and Bob Kaluza.
Welcome back, Mr. Jimmy.
So, we got all of 500 feet
of cement poured, huh?
That cement's the only thing
between us and a blowout.
And it's cured.
It is... had enough time.
It takes time to do it right.
I mean, that cement job is
compromised and everything above it is...
- It's not compromised, Houston doesn't have a problem.
- So I assume the Schlumberger guys said the same.
Cement bond log they ran
said the same, yeah?
We are confident in the integrity
of our cement job, are we not?
Oh, we're quite comfortable with the
integrity of cement effort... true.
- Just like my grand-dad.
- Pardon?
Ya see, my grand-daddy he... he never even went to the
dentist, 'cause he didn't want to know all what was wrong,
'Cause then he'd have to deal with it.
You don't want to know if that
cement job on this well is shit,
'cause you're 43 days and
50 million over budget.
- You really should include yourself in that Mr. Jimmy.
- BP picked this spot to drill, Bob.
Consequences of that are on you guys...
'course
I gotta try to deal with those
consequences, so, yeah, I'm included.
The point is, you sent the testing
team home before they could do their job,
maybe give y'all some news y'all did wrong here. What
would it've cost ya to run that test, 125 grand?
You're a 180 billion dollar
company and you cheat.
That's why we're 186 billion dollar
company, we worry about those bills.
I worry about my rig,
my crew lives on it.
You just rent it, Don, you and I both know
we need some down time for maintenance.
- Mike, how many of our machines need repair?
- 390 Mr. Jimmy.
- Three hundred ninety?
- Yes, Sir, all of 10 percent of all the machinery aboard.
- Name a few for me.
- A few?
I would love to know exactly what piece
of mission critical equipment on down.
Shit, where do I start?
"A" drill chair, process station 18, BOP control
pods, telephone systems, hyperactive systems,
GPS antenna, direct TV system,
wireless internet,
iron roughneck, top drive ratback system,
auxiliary draw worse controls
salt water service pumps,
smoke alarms in the galley.
And the reason you're sweatin' so hard, it's because
of the pressure of the A.T.I. is down, too.
- Everything but the toilets, huh?
- No, no, you got problems there, too, but I don't do shitters.
That's engineering.
- Who are you?
- Mike Williams, Chief E. T.
I'm gonna tell you like I told your
executives on the chopper ride here
about the timing of that visit.
We gonna properly secure
this well for a production
platform comin' in right
after us start pumpin' oil,
Unfortunately, to do it
properly takes time.
43 days? 44 days?
- Keep countin', Bob.
- 45 days? 46 days?
Have a cookie, Bob?
Can't run a cement log,
I tell ya what we're gonna do now.
We gonna run the negative pressure
test before we do anything else.
If really think we need to.
I really think we need one,
Bob, and so should you.
Especially since we got no idea
whether this well is stable or not.
Hey! Dial tone!
Day's lookin' up.
Mr. Anderson, this is Mr. Jimmy.
We gonna run a negative pressure test, start
trippin' out 3000 feet of pipe... thank you.
Young man, pardon me, can you please
tell me where I can find Mr. Mike Williams?
Yes, Sir, he's in the ET shops on
the second deck by the coffee shop.
- Thank you much.
- Have a wonderful day, Sir.
And you, Sir.
Mr. Williams?
Mr. Vidrine, are you lost?
Not at all.
Just looking to come by and
visit with you for a minute.
Well, how can I help?
Seems as though you had something
more you wanted to say in there.
I thought I give you
the time to say it.
Okay, so this rig is broke?
- I didn't' say that.
- Sounds like you did.
Is there a reason why you
in my shop, Mr. Vidrine?
We a big company, Mike... BP.
A very big far-reachin',
complex organization...
a lot of movin' parts...
millions of movin' parts.
Thousands upon
thousands of people.
And we all work very hard to
ensure that all those people,
and all those movin' parts are
functioning properly as a means to an end,
so they're a profit win for all
of us, so, they the big picture.
They the little picture, like you,
and the malfunctionin' shitters.
But, you see, in point of fact,
they all kind of interconnected,
they flow but working, Mike.
So if you off, it's off, then I'm off, then
we off, then the whole damn train is off.
You feel me, Mr. Williams?
You on medication, Mr. Vidrine?
I'm merely trying to assess just how
close this train is hugging the track.
Okay, I hear ya.
- You want my take, I mean you really want my take.
- I do.
Okay, I think you all trying to run
out of fuel as the wheels touchdown.
Running out of gasoline as
the plane lands is not smart,
it's flawed thinking,
it's hope as a tactic.
Duly noted and much appreciated, Sir.
Just the opinion of a little guy.
That a catfish?
Yep, 65 pounds.
Whatchy'all call that, Nibbling?
Noodlin', we noodlin' for catfish.
You know that's funny, 'cause when we
go noodlin', my best friend Pino and I,
We go down there with a fifth of Crown
on the lake, walk down the boat ramp,
we look for the biggest, darkest,
blackest hole we can stick our arm in.
We hope those big son of bitches
bite down on us as hard as he can
so we can rip his ass out of that hole.
We want to get bit,
that's the plan.
Difference is we're
ready for that bite.
We are ready... I'm wearing shoes, hats,
gloves, skull caps, sunglasses and we are ready.
I'm gonna stick my hand in that hole
with that monster and hope for the best.
Un-huh, hope ain't a tactic, Don.
I thank you for your time.
- Have a wonderful day, Sir.
- And you.
That some shit.
Attention on the rig! Negative
pressure test is about to begin.
All non-essential personnel please
stay clear of the rig platform.
Bring it to the current.
- Come right two degrees, lock heading on 176.
- Coming right 10 degrees, change to 176.
Turning.
- Damon B. Bankson...
- What is that, your fifth cup?
Deepwater Horizon, we are requesting...
Just saying.
Why don't you go ahead and make sure everybody's up
and ready to get after it, this might be the final test.
Roger that.
- Another negative pressure test?
- Another negative pressure test.
- Is there a problem?
- We got a bad well.
They all bad wells, we're at a tough prospect.
Locked.
- Locked at 176, Captain.
- Came right 10 degrees.
- We locked in, y'all can run the negative test.
- Yeah.
- Go ahead, Jason.
- Copy that.
Lose the annular.
- Initiate negative pressure test.
- Initiating drill pipe pressure test.
You really think this is the last test?
Shit, I hope so, yeah, this
is the Well from Hell, girl.
Yeah, well,
that ain't going to last long.
That's all you got.
Goal!
100 pounds per square inch.
That's okay, pushing back on us a little,
she's trying to us honest.
Hey, Don, you get that bottle of wine
that I sent you about a month ago?
I did, I did, thank you very
much, I not only I got it, I drank it.
- Pretty good huh?
- Very nice.
That's Super Tuscan, yeah?
Gaja, right? I know you like it.
- Gaja.
- Sorry?
Gaja... it's called.
I think they're about halfway there.
How much coffee you
drinking these days, Hank?
Look man, I gave it up several months
ago, I drink nothing but green tea now.
Stop taking the coffee doing yoga every day.
Two weeks now.
450 psi.
This don't look good to me.
Pressure! Warning!
900.
Pressure alert.
1395.
Pressure alert.
Pressure alert.
Pressure alert.
We're on at 1395, Mr. Jimmy.
That's a lot of pressure.
Yeah, enough to cut your car in half.
Open in the upper annular.
Hollywood, open up the drill pipe path,
we gotta bleed pressure.
Gentlemen, I hate  to say
this, that is a bad test.
Not necessarily.
Don, a good test...
Starts zero, stays at zero, ends at zero.
Thank you.
So, there is pressure but there was no mud
flowin' up and out of that pipe. now explain that to me.
That's a confusing result,
I give you that.
Kaluza and I have talked about this drill
pipe until we blue in the face.
There's something off with it,
he says it's a bladder effect.
Bladder effect?
Bladder effect, he said Jason
would know what he's talking about.
I say that flow right there.
Correct.
- Looky here.
- Hey, we actually needed that!
Bladder effect, it is a pocket of pressure
trapped around the annular
which reads like drill pressure
because it is trapped right there,
it is sitting right there on the sensor.
If this was a legitimate pressure issue
then we would have mud flowing right back
up and out of that drill pipe right there.
Now, how we going to test this?
We going to run that negative
pressure test again,
but we going to run it on the
kill line, not on the drill pipe.
Obviously our problem is
with that drill pipe.
You cannot have
13,095 pounds of pressure per square inch,
enough to cut your car in half,
and not have any fluid being forced up
and out of that pipe by that pressure.
Boys, you gotta whole mess of
drilling mud on your boots out there?
Hey, Don.
It got hot in the drill shack.
We have a problem with that drill pipe,
or with the sensor giving
us a false reading...
or any other of a thousand
moving parts down there.
Now, the way we going to find out is run
that negative pressure test on the kill line,
and if there is zero pressure, Mr. Jimmy, then
that is going to tell us all we need to know.
Are we in agreement?
I don't know about an agreement,
it never hurts to run a test.
- Look...
- How we doing in here, Mr. Jimmy?
- We doing great, aren't we, Don?
- Yes, we are.
BP's well.
Is it?
- Bp's oil.
- Indeed.
We just to help y'all
hire to a drill a hole.
You are correct, Mr. Jimmy.
But we 50 days late,
and the hole ain't drilled.
Now, Mr. Jimmy, we have issue in the galley.
- A whole bunch of people, it's a safety issue.
- It won't take but a minute.
That's are 43 days, not 50...
simple mathematics.
Whereas your completion date was March 8,
it's 20th April today, 43 days.
Yep.
I think you money-hungry sons
of bitches at least be good at math.
All right, gentlemen.
Oh, hey, Dewey, negative
pressure test on the kill line.
Switching to kill line test.
Initiating kill line pressure test.
Bladder effect.
It ring true to you?
Well... whatever came out of Vildrine's
mouth that really rang true to me, but, yeah.
I mean on its face, yeah.
There's a logic to it,
it's got merit, but...
I don't know, apply to kill pipes and kill lines.
- A little above my pay grade.
- We shoulda seen some mud.
Yes! Good job!
The Deepwater Horizon is receiving BP's
highest safety award for the seventh straight year.
And it all starts at the top with
the man you call "Mr. Jimmy".
- Mr. Jimmy, Mr. Jimmy.
- Make a speech, make a speech.
Held at zero, boss,
good test, no pressure.
Congratulations, good test.
We still got 1400 psi on the drill line.
Drill line and the kill line should be exactly
the same, they should all be lined up.
We already agreed that there's
somethin' wrong with the drill line.
So, why do you keep coming back to it?
I don't know...
good old field practice?
No mud, no flow, we got to go.
Now, how quick can we lock
the door on this well?
I'm not doing nothing until Mr.
Jimmy is made aware.
Is there a man among you?
Is there an adult here?
You...y'all got the paraphernalia,
the dip, the steel toes,
but it's all bullshit, we got
zero pressure on the kill line.
You nervous as cats,
afraid to make it work at every turn.
That will be my summary back
to my bosses in London.
- Bob?
- Agreed.
Again, you can call Mr. Jimmy.
And, uh, don't let me keep you from your ice
cream for another second, thanks.
- This is Mr. Jimmy.
- We ran the negative test.
It was good test,
we got no pressure.
I'm about to start this place
and I want your blessing.
You sure about this, Jason?
Kill line was good, I'm sure of
that, it's the only thing I'm sure of.
These guys are all over me,
what do you wanna do?
Zero flow, correct?
That's correct, no flow.
Are we good?
Well, it's looks like it's
going to be a long night.
You stay on top of it, Jason,
I'll see you in about half an hour, thanks.
- Okay, guys, good test.
- Yahoo.
Get ready to pull out
10,000 barrels of mud.
I think I'm going to take a shower and
wash my day off before I start my night.
-Why don't you get some ice cream, Mike.
- I'm gotta watch my figure.
I'll go fix some smoke detectors before
I'm about to pop somebody in the mouth.
That's a good idea, say
"Hi" to Felicia for me.
- Mr. Jimmy?
- Yes?
We really need you to lead with this.
Get a picture.
Mr. Jimmy,
congratulations, Mr. Jimmy.
Hey, appreciate it a lot, guys.
- Help me check the house.
- Roger that.
We got a good test.
We will start sending you some mud,
transfer... to Bankston.
Copy that.
Nervous as cats, cats ain't scared, I had a cat
named Oscar used to try to mount my Labrador.
I'm opening the annular.
Let's hope that monster ain't awake.
Mud pumps are on.
Removing heavy mud from well.
Displacement Holding, Tank 2.
4%
- Boys, we got a good test.
- Let's pump out all this mud.
We're done.
We're going home, bring in
the mud, bring in the mud.
Damon Bankston at Deepwater Horizon, you are
clear to approach and receive drilling mud.
Copy Deepwater. Coming along
side to receive heavy mud.
...is good, ...good, all below normal.
Attention on deck, prepare to feed
out the mud, 10,000 barrels.
Attention on the rig,
pressure tests were good.
Congratulations, D.W's crew, we about to moving on.
Well from Hell is done, boys.
Damn, we'll be in the basin soon.
Two, three days maybe, I'll be in my boat,
drinking me a beer, catching us a sucker at the lake.
Yes! You big beautiful mud.
35%.
- Hang on, baby.
- We are going home!
I thought you had other plans,
I thought you were goin' out.
I cancelled.
- Sweatpants, Bud Light, lime, DVR time.
- Okay.
A simple country girl.
55%
75%
Hopefully smoother this time.
Jason!
I got a 20 barrels increase in ...
and an increase in flow, it's not slowing down.
All right, stop pumping mud.
- Pressure alert.
- Oh no.
- Standby.
- ...shutting down.
They must not be liking something up there.
Hey, boys. I'm gonna go
take a leak, you guys good?
- I got you buddy.
- All right.
- Pressure alert.
- It's not stopping.
Clear the drill shack,
get him and him out of here.
What is happening...
Gentlemen, what is the excitement, we
stipulated there's something wrong.
I never should've let you push me. Now get
your ass out of here before I push back.
That comment will be noted.
- What is goin' on?
- Likely nothing, Mr. Kaluza.
- Watch your step over here.
- Shit.
Whatya got, Caleb?
What the hell did she do?
Shit.
Oh, shit..
- What the hell's going on?
- We got flow.
Shit! That ain't good.
- Jason, you seeing this?
- We got flow out here.
- Warning.
- It's not stopping.
Jason, are you seeing this?
- Didn't I tell you not to do anything.
- Is she just kicking or just...
- Clear the floor.
- Oh, shit.
Mike, what is that,
is everything okay?
I'm closing the annular.
- Duck, get in here now.
- Are you shutting it in?
All right we're okay,
I closed the annular, we got 30 seconds.
Get off the floor, now!
- Duck, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
Get a finger on the EDS,
get ready to cut that pipe.
Go do it! Go do it!
- Adam!
- Shane!
What do we do?
- Caleb!
- What do we do?
Release the drill pipe pressure!
I'm doing my best to accommodate it,
but look, we got...
Okay, okay, we're all
right, we're all right.
- Caleb, how you doing buddy?
- Did we cut the pipe?
We're good, annular took
care of it, it's just a kick.
It's the biggest damn
kick I ever seen.
She put a whoop ass on
Maggie and her penguin.
- Get out of here.
- She did.
And she did it all without this?
- No!
- That is a genuine dinosaur tooth.
Gas alarm in the mud pits, again, same
one goes off every time, all fall down.
- Hey, Roy!
- I got it, you gotta get outta here.
Too late.
Pressure. Warning.
Pressure. Warning.
Jason!
Oh, shit!
Caleb, get everybody off...
The BOP ain't working.
Holy shit!
Duck, close the second annular.
Annular failure.
Adam! Shane!
Get down to the mud room now.
Adam! We gotta go, buddy!
- We gotta get to the mud room.
- Caleb!
- Caleb!
- Get off the floor! Get off the floor!
It's Pump 2! Bleed it! Bleed it!
Caleb, we're closing the drill pipe now and we
feeding the standpipe, divert everything overboard.
...what do we do?
- We got debris!
- Oh, shit!
Caleb, clear the floor.
You're all right?
The alarm didn't stay up, I'm gonna make sure everyone evacuates.
Get to the lifeboats!. Go!
Halt. Stop.
Look out! Look out!
What the hell.
Dammit!
Jesus.
Deepwater Horizon, this
is David Bankston, you copy?
The BOP is not responding.
Duck, hit me twice!
Right now!
Caution! Gas!
- Duck! Duck!
- What happened?
Keith! Gordie!
Come on! Get up!
Roy! C'mon, man!
We gotta go, we gotta go right now!
- Alert gas.
- Shit, we got a gas alarm.
The thrusters are over-revving.
The thrusters are running away from me.
- I'm not going to be able to hold the rig in place.
- Calm down.
Is it just me or did it just get all
bright in there all of the sudden?
Magenta alarm, magenta alarm.
- The well is blowing out.
- What?
Mike.
Mayday!
This is Deepwater Horizon, we're...
What are you doing? Did
I asked you to call a mayday!
I'll call you back!
I'll call you back!
You don't know the difference between
a kick and a goddamn blowout!
- Why is?
- You don't know shit!
- Why is the monitor out?
- Gas.
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
This is Deepwater Horizon.
Come on, Duck,
I'm going to get you out.
Goddammit! Dewey! Steve!
- No!
- Jesus!
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
This is Deepwater Horizon.
- The rig's on fire.
- We got a major explosion, we need assistance.
- Don't you see it's on fire?
- I repeat we have mass casualty explosion.
We need assistance immediately.
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
This is Damon Bankston.
The Deepwater Horizon has
exploded and is on fire.
I say again, Deepwater Horizon
has exploded and is on fire.
- We just saw a huge explosion.
- Yes, Sir, the Deepwater Horizon is on fire.
If everybody's off the rig,
we have no idea.
United States Coast Guard, District 8 Command
Center, Ensign Von Huene speaking.
Yes, there's an oil rig fire...
Okay an oil rig on fire, about 48
nautical miles south of Venice.
Okay, yes, Sir, what vessel are you on,
what's the name of your vessel?
Coast Guard, District 8 Command Center,
this is Lieutenant Degan speaking.
An oil rig on fire? Sir, do
you have a position for that?
Sir, I'm not exactly sure,
I need to get some information from
you first if that's all right,
can I get your name, please?
Sir, What is your location?
- We got a 100 miles south of Port Fourchon.
- Where's your call?
48 miles south off the coast of Venice,
I had a report from OSV vessel.
That lat and long, that's
a confirmed position.
Sir! Sir! We got a satellite image
of the scene... right here.
Oh, my God.
Listen, guys,
we need to bump this up, okay?
Call land area see what kind of float cutters we
have in the area, divert 'em over to the area.
Air stations, I need to know how many
Bravo aircraft do we have up?
Okay, get 'em going.
Shit.
Evacuation procedure is in effect,
this is not a drill.
Evacuation procedure is in effect.
This is not a drill.

We gotta get to the lifeboats,
I'm gonna get you out, all right?
Shit.
Evacuation procedure is in effect,
this is not a drill.
...thruster 2.
I just lost 4 thrusters on the port side,
I only have 4 left, Captain.
- What do we do?
- We need a damage report.
I'm gonna take manual control over the rig.
Kuchta on the bridge,
I need a damage report.
- Please.
- Fire team now!
...Bankston ...Coast Guard.
We have an incident on
the Deepwater Horizon.

Let's go, you got the first kits.
Empty out the supply house, let's go.
Proceed to assigned lifeboat.
Son of a bitch!
Hey! Hey! He needs to get on the boat!
- He's hurt, this man is hurt bad.
- I don't give a shit!
Get on the boat.
Listen to me he's hurt real bad.
Do you understand me?
Calm down.
Anybody seen Mr. Jimmy?
I saw him in the accommodation.
I'm going back for Mr. Jimmy,

- Yeah.
- Okay, let's get...
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, you're good?

- Yeah.
Lifeboats, right now,
we're gonna make a left
Stay to the wall. Hey! Stay to the wall.
Whoa!
Mr. Jimmy?
Hey!
- Help!
- Mr. Jimmy!
Hey!
Who's there?
C'mere quick!
- Mr. Jimmy? Mr. Jimmy?
- Mike!
I can't... I can't see shit.
I got... what... what happened?
We blow out Mr. Jimmy?
There's secondary explosions...
we got fire everywhere.
We disconnect it?
Did we cut the pipe?
I don't know,
but I don't think so.
We need to disconnect, Mike,
help me get to the bridge.
I'll take you to the bridge.
- I got you. All right. C'mon.
- Where are we?
You wouldn't recognize me
even if you could see it.
This pipe is gonna break.
C'mon, Mr. Jimmy, c'mon.
If you find yourself in the water you got
a light and a whistle, you understand?
If you get into an oil anything
swim away from the rig.
Should we wait for the Coast Guard?
No way! We need to go!
C'mon. Let's go! Now!
- Let's go now. C'mon!
- The water's on fire.
- Who's coordinating the air assets out there?
- ATC, fixed wing, they have gear.
West Jefferson, East Jefferson
and Tulane are prepared to take...
- Start.
- External power.
Coast Guard Area 1, clear.
There's people jumping in the water,
he sees 3 people jumping in the water.
- Jumpers, can you get me...
- You have jumpers?
What's the ETA on the first helicopter.
Sir, it's going to be 35 minutes.
About 30 minutes too late.
This is US Coast Guard B47 departing
on a route to emergency distress
call for Deepwater Horizon.
ETA to location, 25 minutes.
Get in! Get in!
- You good?
- Yeah.
- All right, c'mon!
- Help!
Can you hear 'em?
Is someone there?
This is Caleb, I need help over here.
It's Wyman!
We gotta get out of here,

I found him here like this, he's hurt
real bad now, he ain't getting up.
- Don't look down, all right?
- No, no, no.
Wait! Shit, His bone's caught on the metal.
Mike!
Mike!
C'mon, we gotta work this, we gotta
find something to get it open.
Pull! Pull!
Keep pulling!
I've lost power.
All right, just stop,
give me a second, let me think.
I'm gonna cut the pipe.
Hey, hey, hey, Andrea,
get your ass back on station.
We don't have the authority.
I'm going to seal the well.
Do not touch that button!
- We need to take the EDS.
- We don't have the authority.
You ain't pushing it.
Can somebody help me?
- Go! Get out of here!
- You're coming with or without that leg.
Hold on, hold on,
hey, look at me.
This gonna hurt like a bitch,
you stay calm for a second, okay.
Look at me, don't look down,
look at me.
We gotcha!.
Hold on.
Pull. Pull.
Wyman, can you move?
Okay, then let's go.
Okay, get me to the bridge, Mike.
Coast Guard, District 8 Command
Center, Lieutenant Degan speaking.
Hi, Sir.
I just... um... I don't mean to bother
you, I'm sure everything's just fine.
But my husband. Mike Williams, is
on the Deepwater Horizon and uh.
Yes, ma'am. Right now we only have a couple of
confirmed reports with a fire on an oil rig.
That's about all I can say.
They're on the Deepwater Horizon?
Because there's so many rigs
out there, you... you sure?
Yes, Ma'am, there is a fire on
the Deepwater Horizon.
That's all I can say, Ma'am, I'm sorry, I really have to go.
What happened?
Ken, you all right?
The derrick's gonna fall on us!
Damn, the boat's leavin'!
My crane is gonna take
the goddamn derrick out.
- It's coming down!
- Get on the boat now!
I gotta stop it,
or it's gonna kill us all.
Go, Dale!
Go! Go! Go!
Help him up the stairs.
Shit!
Go Dale!
Dale get out!
Get out of there! Now!
Oh, my God.
Who's on the bridge?
- Fleytas.
- Kuchta.
Get your ass on the lifeboat.
- Andrea, Kuchta, have we disconnected?
- No.
Andrea, get my hands on the EDS.
I'm gonna cut the pipe and seal this well.
We gonna choke this fire.
- Right here, right here.
- No, no, up, up!
Is it still burning?
- It still flow, Mr. Jimmy.
- Oh, c'mon. Please! Please!
It still burning Mr. Jimmy, we gotta go.
Hey! Hey! Back up!
C'mon, c'mon, there room for a coupla more! Get in!
We need to restore
power up here.
- We need to bring the standby generator online.
- With the fire fighting pumps?
No, we just want to keep this rig on station
as long as we can, so that pipe doesn't break.
- That's all we can do, we can't save this rig.
- All right then, it can't hurt to go try.
Naw, it could, very much Mike, it's on
the other side of that derrick.
I know it, I know it.
- I'm coming with you.
- What?
- I'm with you.
- You sure?
- I'm with you.
- Go on, Mike.
C'mon.
Natalie, this is Felicia Williams, our husbands
work on the Deepwater Horizon together.
Well, I just called the Coast Guard and they can
just confirmed that there is a fire...
but I just wondering maybe
you heard something.
What did the Coast Guard say?
Just that there's been a fire.
Shelly heard there's people
jumping off the rig.
What are you doing?
Not now, babe.
- What's wrong?
- Not now, baby.
Shit.
Come on.
Lighten both...

"Switching power switch."
Turned to the on position.
Okay, "Press main start button"...
Red one right there.
I'm impressed man, I don't know
many roughnecks that can read.
Very funny, very funny.
You know I had a full ride
to UT architecture school.
What the hell you doing here?
- I should've listen to my mom.
- Maybe you should have.
- Mr. Jimmy, you get any power up there?
- This should be it.
Do you have any power?
- We still outside the walk circle?
- Yes, for outstation.
- Turn it nice and slow.
- Okay.
Bring us back slow.
C'mon on, baby! C'mon!
Shit!
Shit.
Get your start key
turn to on position.
We gotcha, We gotcha!
Watch his leg!
Wait for the pull plug light.
- C'mon.
- This should be it.
There you go.
Mr. Jimmy, did you get power up there?
- We have power, Mike.
- Please, no, no.
Kuchta, can you help me?
- What's goin' on?
- Close the door! Now!
Get to the boat, Mike, it's over.
Jimmy, we have to go.
Look out!

We gotta get to the boat.
Lower the boat, we're full.
Let's go!
Come on.
They left us! They left us! Shit!

No, wait! Wait!
There is too much fire,
we can't jump from here.
We need to get up higher.
We need to get up higher, come on.
Slow down, slow down.
- It's a raft!
- Hang on.
Come on.
Bankston Rescue!
Here! Over here!
We got you, here you go.
C'mon, we got to get up, c'mon.
On the stairs, going high!
Shit! Shit!
C'mon, c'mon.
Hey.
C'mon.
Original V8 or a crate motor?
Your Mustang, original V8 or crate motor?
It's original.
That's cool, ya know,
we might be able to rebuild it.
Who's we?
Do you see anyone else here?
Me and you.
Now, listen to me, look at me!
A little up higher, you can jump off first.
- Okay? We gonna jump over the fire.
- No, no.
I can't.
Can't what? Rebuild an engine?
Jump.
Trust me, we're not gonna
hit the fire, you hear me?
- I don't wanna die.
- You're not gonna die.
I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die.
Our choice right now
is to burn or jump!
Will you let go of me!
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me! You jump.
Do what you want.
You know what? I'm gonna
do whatever you do.
No.
- My wife's name Felicia, my daughter's Sydney.
- Don't put that on me.
And I will see them again,
do you understand me?
What are the odds of you getting out of this
alive if you don't jump with me right now?
We're getting off this rig,
do you hear me?
You wanna stay here,
you stay here.
Hey, what color is the Mustang?
Andrea! Andrea!
If you hear your name, holler out.

Thy will be done, on Earth

Lead us not into temptation

Hey, hey, hey, you on the rig?

My son, do you know him?

Somebody better tell me something.
Somebody help me.
Did you hear any one of the alarms?
Daddy.
I remember closen' my eyes and
saying a prayer, asking God
to tell my wife and my little girl
that daddy did everything he could,
and if I survive this, it's for a reason.
Please raise your right hand, Sir..
Do you solemnly swear that the
testimony you about to give is the truth,
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God.
- Yes Sir.
- Thank you, Sir.
We went to the next light that we saw
in the water and retrieved that person.
It was Andrea, the dynamic position operator.
I went to the PA made the last announcement
and said that we were abandoning the rig.
Who in your view was in charge of the rig?
- The OIM.
- That would be Mr. Harrell, is that correct?
Right.
There was a major explosion followed by
second explosion on the starboard side.
After the explosion, I called the
rig floor, there was no answer.
All the things that they told us
could never happen... happened.
Men lost their lives.
