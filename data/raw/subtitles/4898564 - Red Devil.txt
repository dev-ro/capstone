Do you believe that
you can ever quit Red Devil?
You can't quit this shit, is
impossible
and even if you could why the
fuck would you even want to?
So you don't want to quit?
What about for the sake of your
two children?
Once you've tasted the devil's
cum,
everything else is dull and
numb.
[MUSIC]
Can we go, Oscar?
Yes, of course, darling, but
try to be nice to her.
This might be the last time we
see her,
she's just old.
Please be patient.
I don't like her.
Mother this is Ella,
your daughter-in-law, remember Ella?
Hello, mom.
I don't have a daughter, I have two sons.
Now, scupper.
Do you mind if I smoke a cigar around
you, it helps me relax.
By all means.
She's a Polak from Poland.
Yes I know mother remember,
remember I hired her and pay her salary
You know you can actually trust the
slobs due to their incredible stupidity.
You can't trust the stupid any more
than you can trust a wild animal,
their stupidity makes them
unpredictable, you see dear.
I once had sexual relations with
a Polak,
big muscular chap named Lucas.
Thick his two short planks
for wonderfully handsome.
Fantastic.
His penis had the best
incredible girth.
Of course, I was still married
to your father at the time,
so it was all very hush-hush.
Lucky daddy.
You know your father never
could perform sexually,
even on our honeymoon in Haiti,
he was as shrivelled up as a prawn.
Who is this vulgar woman again?
Any news from William?
William?
Yes, mother, my brother,
your youngest son William.
Oh, I thought you were talking about
the perverted old fool from number 68.
My brother, mother, has he
called you?
My son William, he's a drug
addict.
Yes, have you had any news? Has
he called you?
Has he been around to visit you?
But he is a mess, isn't he?
So you have seen him, he's been
around?
Who dear?
William.
He's a drug addict dear.
Me and your father found a red devil
drug in his bedroom and threw him out.
That was years ago mother.
Try to think carefully,
has he been around to visit recently?
He's probably dead dear,
drug addicts tend not to live long.
You're talking about your son,
do you give a shit?
How old are you Ella? 35? 37?
Mother.
A woman in her 30's is far
too old to be having children.
Are you really going to let
your mother speak to me this way?
The child will be born a
mongoloid if you're not careful,
you do know Mongoloids upset me
greatly, don't you, dear?
Oscar.
Ignore her. She's old and
crazy.
She's talking about our child.
What would you have me do?
Putting her out of her misery
would be the kindest thing to do.
[SCREAMS]
[MUSIC]
[MUSIC]
It's all just an urban legend.
[GUN SHOTS]
You know who we are and you
know what we want.
The Red Devil and the money,
you sons of bitches.
Quickly as you can.
He's got it.
Danny? Danny, can you swing me
a Red?
What? No, no, no. Danny, Danny,
no. [CRIES]
Don't you get it, Riley. There
is no more Red.
It's gone as quickly as it came.
Quite frankly I'm glad it's
gone.
It's the devil's potion.
You're making me so fucking wet
right now.
They hit us last week.
Cleaned out and that cute little
Franco.
Fucking who, man? Who?
You try anything funny,
and I assure I'll kill you both.
What do you mean who?
Ella and fucking Oscar.
Ella and Oscar and urban
legends.
They're created by the media to
strike fear into the underworld
and get the fucking men off the
street.
Oh, baby, fuck me.
I'll tell you one thing now,
all right?
There is no such thing
as a married couple running
around killing fucking drug
dealers.
Fucking ridiculous.
Kill these mother fuckers baby.
Kill them good.
Oh, baby, if you insist.
No, no.
[GUN SHOTS]
[MOANS]
Leo?
Theo.
How are you doing, darling?
Good to see you.
Looking good.
Looking good.
Excuse me, sir. Can you spare
some change?
I'm so sorry, man. Just, I'm
[?], you know.
Next time, man.
God bless you.
Dear God,
it's just us, Oscar, Ella, and
bump.
Hope all is well on your end.
I can feel the task you've given
us is close to being complete,
and I want to thank you for believing that
we were worthy enough for such a task.
Please forgive Ella for doubting the
vision and for doubting her husband,
and please look out for my
brother William,
wherever he may be,
and rid him of this evil
addiction.
I've done a lot for you.
I've taken a lot of lives
and I've eradicated Red Devil
from Covet County.
Some might say you owe me that
much.
Anyway, must dash, have your
work to do.
All the best, amen.
Amen.
Baby, let's go kill some
sinners.
I fucking love you, baby.
I fucking love you, angel.
[KISS]
[MUSIC]
Please, sir.
Please, I'd do anything just
crumb of that Red.
I just need one crumb of Red.
Please, sir. I beg you.
Fuck, you can take it all, look.
Yes, everything I've got,
man, please, just one pull.
No, fuck off.
Please, I just need one hit,
man, I beg you.
No, there's a drought on.
Give me the fucking Red, man.
Give it to me, give it to me,
or you're a fucking dead man.
I'll fucking blow you away.
Take it.
[GUN SHOT]
[MUSIC]
Brother, brother.
Give me a puff, give me a puff.
Get the fuck away from me.
Just give me a dab.
Get the fuck away.
Give me a dab.
Please give me a dab,
Will you give me a fucking a dab?
I only want a dab.
There he is.
The man,
the myth,
the legend,
Gabriel.
My friend.
Who's tall, thick, faithful,
and fearless?
You guessed it, me.
[DOOR SHUTS]
I see you put my gift to good
use.
I could never shoot anyone,
but I don't half feel dangerous
when I smoke bud out of the barrel.
I'm like John Wayne or Jesse
James.
Please tell me you keep these
loaded, at least.
Oh, Hugo, I've told you before, you can
never be too careful in your line of work.
That's why I bought you the gun.
Covet County is a dangerous
place,
but worry not, my friend,
the Beast will keep you safe.
The Beast will keep us all safe.
You have got to try this.
Now, it's a mashup
of Green Dream, Ice Cream Haze,
and Triple Dipper,
and I call it Triple Cream
Dream.
This is a thing of beauty.
It's like the sun rising on a
cold autumn morning in the Amazon.
That's what I tell them.
You, my friend, will become a
true master in the art of botany.
This is like the yin to the
yang,
the Michelangelo of marijuana.
Come on in, Riley.
You want to be plugged in?
Not today, man.
What, you is a fucking wanker
then, aren't you?
Hey, listen, dude.
I know you told me not to ask you, man.
If I told you not to ask me
something, don't ask me.
I just need to see if you
can get hold of any Red, man.
Ah, sorry.
Get the fuck out of my club
now, man.
Okay. Calm down, man.
I'm no flab, man.
If you're even thinking about
asking me about that Red shit,
I'll tell you something now. I'm going thump
you and I am going to blood that mouth.
I don't touch that shit, man.
Well, all right then,
what would you like?
Pure euphoria, the fuck of your
life,
killing spree, secret spying?
I even got a special on reverse
gang bang.
Man...
Come on, son, make up your
mind.
I've been told to...
You decide what you want yet,
young man,
or you prefer to call a friend
and ask him his opinion?
Man, I don't want any trouble.
This is all I fucking need.
100 VR lounge in all Covet County
and this cunt want to set up
his residency in one of my
lounge?
Didn't I tell you not to come
back here again?
If I see you come back to
this Velvet Lounge again,
I'm going to hurt you.
This is a place of escape.
You're putting people off their
fun.
What is it you want?
You want the kiddies' stuff or something?
Of course not.
Because I don't care how much you
fucking weirdos are willing to pay,
I will have nothing to do with
it.
Let me tell you something.
I'm not a fucking pedo.
Listen, man, you've been umming and
ahing ever since you got in here.
What exactly is it you want?
I'm looking for Ella and Oscar.
I've been told to meet them here.
No one of that name have
anything to do with this lounge.
Unless you want to be plugged
in, you can leave.
You're giving me a headache.
You know what, don't worry
about it, man, cheers.
Who the fuck told you you can
come here?
A fucking priest.
He told me to come here at two
o'clock.
His name?
Who?
The priest, his name.
It's Barry, but don't worry
about it.
Your name, please?
Alfie.
Come with me then, please,
Alfie.
Give me the fucking pipe.
Charlie, is that you?
Just give me the fucking Red or
I'll cave your fucking head in.
Charlie, it's Riley, it's your
cousin.
I don't give a fuck who you are.
Just give me the fucking Red now.
[GUN SHOT]
Please, Riley.
Just give me a fucking hit on
the pipe.
I'm your cousin.
[GUN SHOT]
[MUSIC]
Hello, Alfie.
Excuse the mess.
Please, come in. Take a seat.
Thank you.
I understand our friend Barry
has been speaking with you
about a situation we might
be able to help you with.
It's true.
It's actually you two.
Ella and Oscar, wow.
Charmed to meet you.
You do realize, you've caused
the biggest drug drought
in Covet County since, I don't
know, since ever. I promise you,
I thought it was an urban legend
until I met Barry, and even then,
I had my doubts.
Who is the target?
Okay, let's do business.
He's a dealer.
Red Devil?
Yes, he got his fingers in lots
of pies.
Did Barry not tell you we would only
be interested if he's a supplier of Red?
That what this is with you guys?
A vigilante crusade on Red Devil?
You could say that.
Okay, with all due respect, Mr. Oscar,
there are hardly any Red dealers left.
They have either been dropped, killed,
vanished off the scene in terror.
You might be able to score a
little bit in Peccancy Street,
but it's mostly chili powder.
Every dealer in the entire county is afraid
of being killed or robbed by you two.
Except this character, it
seems.
You have our attention.
Tell us everything you know.
My little babies, huh?
Mary. How are you?
Hi, Hugo, how's everything?
Good, good, come in.
Yes, good to see you.
I was just after an eighth,
so I thought I'd give you a knock.
Well, I'm glad you did.
You got company?
Oh, it's just my good friend,
Gabriel.
He's tall, he's fit, he's
fearless, and he's faithful.
I can come back another time if
you...
No, don't be silly, no, you'll like him.
He's like family.
Where? Where is he, then?
Gabriel.
Probably gone for a shit.
Either that, or he's heard a
woman's voice,
and he's probably sneaked off
to leave us alone.
He's always going on about
me meeting someone.
Not that I'm interested in you.
Oh, right.
No, I don't mean that.
I ain't got time for a
girlfriend.
Yes, I'm really busy right now.
Yes, I can see that.
It's called Triple Cream Dream.
It's beautiful.
It looks it.
You can stay if you want.
No, I better go.
Well, another time, maybe.
Yes, maybe.
How much do I owe you?
Oh, please, no charge.
Sweet.
It's just, just maybe,
come round, have cup of coffee,
listen to some Purple Rabbits.
Purple Rabbits?
That's awful, depressing music.
Right, you better go. I've got
to feed the kids.
You have children?
No, my plants.
Oh, right.
You should really give him a
chance, you know.
Sorry?
Purple Rabbits.
They influenced a whole generation.
They're the main reason I moved to
Covet County in the first place,
after hearing one of their
songs.
Which one?
Covet County. Covet County,
roll a fatty, sniff some
Charlie.
Good to see you, Hugo.
Got anything on you?
No, I haven't got anything.
Wait, I've got money.
Hey baby, let me give you the
best blowjob you've ever had.
I don't want a blowjob, right,
I want some fucking Red.
Hey, where you going, big boy?
Want to have some fun?
Can you sort me any Red?
I'm going to sort you out if you can.
Oh, you don't need any Red.
I'm going to suck you until you're dry.
Maybe another time, darling,
all right?
What you mean, another time?
I'll even swallow.
Hi, Steve.
Hey, leave the old bloke alone,
man.
Watch your mouth, little boy.
Leave the tramp alone.
Sorry, Steve.
Get the fuck out of here.
Makes my heart bleed when I see
the state of the youth today.
[?] adolescents get in the way of
your little private party tonight.
What are you after? I've got coke,
brown, speed, weed, girls, boys.
What you need, cuz?
I need some Red, man.
There's a drought, it's going
to cost you.
Well, is it good?
Straight from the source this morning.
It's beautiful, but it's expensive.
I'm paying well over the odds
for it at the moment,
so the circle of life being the circle
of life, it means if I pay more,
my customers pay more, and you
pay more.
What's expensive, man?
Where you going, big boy?
I see you looking at me. What do
you need?
I don't want anything, all
right?
Oh, come on, come with me,
white sugar.
I'll stick a big black dildo so far up your
arse, you won't walk right for a month.
Is that what you're into, baby boy?
Did mama guess your desire right?
What? No. Just fuck off, you
dirty fucking whore.
What the fuck? Who the fuck
do you think you're talking to?
Don't think because I'm a woman out here
of these streets that I won't fight you.
What, so this man thinks he's
brave, yes?
I say you leave it, yes? Can't you
see we're conducting business here?
I'm sure once we've
conducted our little business
he'll consider a nice relaxing blowjob
in front of a nice warm log fire,
listening to the beautiful
sounds of Nina Simone,
whilst he sips on a glass of
brandy
and enjoys his contemptible buzz
supplied by yours truly.
But until then, if you don't
mind, princess.
Watch yourself, fucking fool.
How much is it, man?
How much do you want?
Well, it depends on the price,
man.
It's addictive this shit, isn't
it?
Fly me, bruv.
Red Devil changed the game, boy.
They say one hit on that shit
and you're hooked for life.
Well, was that how it was for you, eh?
One hit and you're hooked for
life, yes?
Some things help heal the
broken-up, man.
I've never tried it myself.
Though I have to admit,
I have been tempted a couple of times. It
has a way of tempting a person, don't it?
See, I'm one of them rare people
who haven't even smoked a joint.
There's something about that Red stuff,
isn't it? Just really tempts you, don't it?
They say it takes away a guilty
conscience.
Was that how it was for you?
Dude, how much is it, man?
220 a gram, but it's lovely.
Can you do it for a... Do a deal
for a quarter, man?
Seven grams?
You got the money on you, yes?
I'm up for the seven, man.
I'll do you up for 1,250.
Okay, good, done, I've got the
money.
You got the money on you?
Good boy, come on.
Hey, Dreamer, where you going,
man?
Not now, right, I've got to handle
some business. We'll talk in a minute.
Come on, this way. I keep it at
a mate's house.
You can't be too careful
nowadays,
with all these Ella and Oscar type
characters running around killing folk.
It's just urban legends,
but I'll tell you what ain't urban legend.
If this is a fucking setup,
I'm going to end your life, brother.
Just give me the Red, I'll give
you the cash.
Put the fucking gun away,
all right, this ain't a setup.
You've made your point. All right?
Your point has well and truly been made.
I make love, not war. Now, come
on.
Give me the fucking money now,
little prick, huh?
Now, before I blow your fucking
head off.
[?] any red, bro?
I don't deal with that Devil
shit.
[GUN SHOTS]
Don't come back around, do you hear me? No
one calls my wife a whore, you little prick.
Fucking waste, man. Next time I'll put
one between your eyes, you little cunt.
Somebody help me.
I need some Red.
Ah, Oscar, Ella.
How the fuck are you?
Any word from my brother
William?
No, sorry, Oscar, nothing.
Oscar, tell me, how's things?
Are you looking after my little
sis?
Barry, you and I both well know
that Ella
is the one doing the looking
after in this relationship.
Good girl. [LAUGHTER]
Barry, we have some wonderful news.
You're going to tell him?
Shall I?
Go on.
Well,
you know me and Oscar
have been trying for a baby.
Oh, really?
We're having a baby.
Ah, you've actually done it,
Oscar.
Well done, mate, well done. Ah, I always
thought your swimmers were like...
Limited.
Yes, but with a little help
from our favourite gynaecologist,
and a lot of faith in the man
upstairs.
Amen.
You're going to be an uncle.
Whoa. Butch, champagne,
just two glasses, please
Yes, boss.
I think it's time you two
should retire.
You must've made a fortune over
these past few years.
What's it been 80, 90 robberies? I bet
you got yourself a nice little nest egg.
Once we've finished this final chapter,
taking care of this Hugo fellow.
That's exactly what we'll do.
Forget Hugo, forget Red Devil,
Ella's pregnant.
You can't do another job.
She'll miscarry, for Christ sakes.
Hey, fuck you, Barry, I'm only
three months.
What's wrong with you two?
Oscar, you should know better.
We must finish what we've
started.
Which is what?
To rid the streets of Red
Devil.
Ah, Jesus Christ,
you're not going on about that vision?
You do realize, you sound like a madman
when you talk like that, don't you?
I couldn't give a shit what
anybody thinks.
I know my husband, Barry.
He wouldn't make something like that up.
If he says God came down and spoke to
him, he came down and spoke to him.
You're both as fucking crazy as
each other.
I know what I saw.
God came down to you in a dream,
and he said, "Rid the world of Red Devil"?
It wasn't a dream, it was a
vision.
Oh, was you awake, though?
I was wide awake.
I was more awake than I've ever been.
God came to me.
What, like a man with a big white beard?
Please, elaborate.
His voice, his touch, the
light, it was indescribable
and I knew right then and there that Ella
and I were born this way for a reason.
Our reason to be is to rid the
streets of Red.
Well, you succeeded. Alfie is the first fresh
lead I've had for Red Devil in two weeks.
You've won, there's no more Red.
Mission accomplished, loves.
Your God is very happy that you've killed
so many people and flushed millions of
pounds worth of product down the toilet.
Relax, Barry, you are so
dramatic.
If I had known you were pregnant,
I would've never introduced you to Alfie.
Thank you, Butch.
Congratulations.
Shut up, Butch.
Thanks, Butch.
Speaking of whom, may I ask,
were you that fond of that Alfie?
Alfie, yes, he's a good man.
Why? What have you done now?
[MUSIC]
You're absolutely sure that's
everything?
That's right, man. Just, where
is my money?
[GUN SHOT]
Snap out of it, Hugo.
Give the customer his weed, and
let him leave.
Hugo, you're hallucinating.
I think I'm hallucinating.
Oh, now, I understand the
psychedelic sojourn
into the parallel universe of
your mind.
I love the new look, mate.
Why thank you. Rouge is all the
rage this year.
Whatever, mate.
Why don't I entertain you with a
story to help you on your new voyage?
Oh, I love stories.
I am from a small mountain
village called Phantasmagoria,
at the foothills of Mount Wraith, an
ancient and noble people of immense faith,
but limited technology.
One cold April years ago,
when I was barely out of puberty,
we heard news from the city that soldiers
were heading to the village to
slaughter and kill us,
for reasons too sophisticated
for us to understand.
We had sticks and stones,
the soldiers had AK-47s.
As was our custom, we consulted
the eldest man in the village,
a wise old man called Hellion.
Well, Hellion pondered deeply.
Finally, he told us of a tale
told to him by his grandfather,
the tale of a magical plant
called the Tiabolo.
This plant has been blessed by
Ares, son of Zeus,
and God of War has a way of
protecting the village from Nemesis,
God of ill will and revenge.
Hellion told us,
just eating one of the plant's
many leaves would provide every man
with the strength of a lion,
and the power of immortality.
The problem was that the sacred plant
could only be found in one place
in the whole world,
and that was at the peak of Mount Wraith,
the steepest mountain in all of
the village.
A near-impossible climb to reach the
summit, but what else could we do?
We were outnumbered and
outgunned.
Suicide is your only option.
Suddenly everything was clear to
me and in that moment of clarity
I saw a small shrub of weeds by
my feet.
This may not have been the fabled
Tiabolo plant blessed by Ares,
but I considered, did anyone of my village
actually know what this plant looked like?
I filled up my satchel with the shrub,
and called out loudly to my village,
"I have it. "I have the plant of Ares."
Oh, the village, they cheered and danced,
and my satchel was snatched from
me,
and taken to Heraeus to verify the
authenticity of the sacred plant.
Well, Heraeus opened the bag,
and he looked at me.
Standing nervously at the back of the
hut, he smiled at me,
nodded his head, and told the village that
this was indeed the fabled plant of Ares.
The men frantically began to rip
leaves out of the satchel,
and eat them, eat them.
Some ate two, three, and immediately
I saw these desperate people become fearless
warriors of valour within two chews.
The soldiers,
unsuspecting of any resistance,
were met with a force beyond what mortals
are capable of. 3,000 highly-trained,
highly-equipped soldiers were slaughtered
by a barrage of spears, sticks, and rocks.
The plant you grabbed
was the real Tiabolo plant?
Well, what is real? If you believe
something is real, you can see it,
you can touch it. Is that not
real?
It was real enough for my village of peasants
to slaughter 3,000 heavily-armed soldiers.
What happened then?
The army, what it just left you alone?
Well, the leader, he heard of the use
of the sacred Tiabolo plant of Ares
and its mystical powers, and sent
an army of 10,000 heavily-armed men,
tanks, bazookas and rocket
launchers.
Well, he thought that with the
plant's power at his disposal,
he could take over the whole
world.
Yes, yes, but the village,
they fought them off because they believed
that they had the magical
powers.
Of course not. The army wiped
out the entire male population
of the village within about a
minute.
The idiots charged at the tanks with spears
and sticks believing they were invincible.
I hid in the trees with the
elderly and the children.
After all, survival is the
most basic human instinct.
[FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
Mum, Mum.
I told you not to call me that
before.
You call me Queen Beelzebub
like everybody else.
What makes you so special?
Well, take off your shoes.
Oh, what do you want?
Mom, Mom.
What did I just tell you?
Sorry, Queen Beelzebub, I need
your help.
Oh, surprise, surprise.
I've been shot, Mom.
I'm fucking losing loads of blood.
Oh, and what do I look like? A
fucking doctor?
I just need some [?]. Please,
just to help me knock the pain.
Look, just help me, please, Mom.
Oh, poor Riley. Haven't you realized
yet, Red Devil doesn't exist anymore.
He's taken it back, he's gone.
Submit yourself to him, son, submit yourself
to Satan and everything will be okay.
I don't believe in this voodoo black
magic shit, Mom. I fucking need your help.
You won't even live till the morning, son.
Go, I am with my real children.
[FOREING LANGUAGE]
[FOREING LANGUAGE]
I'll see you on the other side,
Riley.
Yes. Yes.
I couldn't save your money, though, Hugo.
I did try, man, but,
as I went and got your money out
of the cash machine,
some big Black blokes, they came out
of nowhere, man, took all me wages.
Fuck, mate.
Hugo, I was lucky to get away
with me life.
[MUSIC]
How's things, man?
Things good, man.
Yes? Good. Can I get the threesome
with the two women and the one man?
Excellent choice, as always,
young man.
Cheers, buddy.
Chair number four.
Same, thank you.
Did you just see that?
See what?
That pervert looked at me like
he wanted to fuck me,
right here in front of
everybody.
Baby, a lot of people look at
you like they want to fuck you.
You're beautiful.
He's cuckolded you.
Jesus, Ella.
He's cuckolded you right here in
front of Dylan. Aren't you embarrassed?
Lord, I think I go and take me
break now, right?
Okay. Take your time.
Ella, we do not have time for this.
We have to get ready for the thing.
You're not going to defend my honor?
You're going to let me, your pregnant wife,
get sexually abused by some
little pervert
and you're just going to
stand there and do nothing?
I've never been so dry in all my
life.
Fine, I'll get him outside,
okay?
You're defending your wife's honor and your
manhood isn't too much of a hassle for you?
You're so fucking dramatic
sometimes.
There he is, look at him.
Fucking pervert.
Here I am, carrying your unborn
fucking child,
minding my own fucking business and
someone eye-fucks me in front of my husband
and what does my husband do?
Nothing.
Now, that was a bit sexy.
You can't carry on like this,
it's not normal.
Maybe not to you.
You can't keep on killing
people.
Barry, would you ask a lion
to stop hunting wildebeest?
Yes, but you're not a lion and
neither is she.
We can't change what we are,
Barry.
Oh, well, so you think it's all
right to go around killing people
just to satisfy your own sexual
perversions?
Barry, you really must join us
on holiday in Peru this Summer.
Wonderful place and such an
ancient culture.
The Peruvians have such an incredible
insight into the human mind.
[FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
Do not search for faults
in one's fucking gifts.
Peru is amazing, Barry.
You wait until you try the ceviche.
The what?
Freshly-caught raw fish marinated in citrus
juices and spiced with chili peppers.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's truly divine.
No, no, no, no, no, no, listen. That
Peru, it doesn't sound like my cup of tea.
Ah, you're so fucking
miserable, Barry.
Oh, fuck off, you.
Fuck you off. We came you to
tell you about our good news
and all you have done is moan,
moan, moan?
You can't go around and keep on killing
people, can you? You crazy fucking bitch.
Are you really going to let him
talk to me like that in front of you?
And the same goes for you, too, Oscar.
Listen, you two, the killing, it stops now.
Don't talk to my husband like
that.
Listen, you're going to be
parents.
What kind of an example are you
trying to set?
Ah, fuck you, you know what?
You are uninvited to Peru.
Oh, fuck off, you. That Peru sounds
like a load of fucking shit anyway.
No, you fucking little cunt.
You see her? She's always been crazy.
You know that, Oscar.
From the first time she arrived,
right?
At the orphanage from Brazil it's
all been like her main slaughter.
Well, I'll tell you something
now, enough is enough, Ella.
Fuck you.
Just now because you're a priest,
that doesn't make you a saint.
Do you remember Mother Monica
at the orphanage?
Yes, yes, what about her?
You hated Mother Monica,
you wished she was dead.
Ella, you poured gas on Mother Monica
and set her alight while she was asleep.
You crazy fucking bitch.
You nearly killed the woman.
Oh, what? You're going to say,
it was the same as Oscar's excuse, was it?
God come down and he just said,
he said, "You got to burn the bitch".
Leave my husband alone, okay?
I told you, it was not a dream,
it was a vision.
I'm glad you came today.
Honestly, Gabriel.
What are you talking about?
Pleasure's all mine.
No, I appreciate that you choose
to chill with me. I'm honored.
Someone's feeling sentimental.
I get lonely.
Bored.
The only reason I sell my babies
to the public is for the company.
I don't even make enough to pay
for the food or the electric.
What you need is a woman.
No, I haven't got time for that.
Who'd look after the babies?
It's not too late to start
a real life for yourself, Hugo.
What's wrong with my life?
I'm a self-employed businessman.
I'm one of this country's
Interpreters.
You mean, entrepreneur.
Yes, whatever.
Ever thought about getting
yourself a job?
Fuck that, man.
It's just too late to start
something new.
If I ever hear that kind
of defeatism from you again,
I swear to god, I'll blow your
fucking head off.
[MUSIC]
I'm applying pressure to stop
the bleeding.
You'll die otherwise.
I've got more important things
on my fucking mind.
What's your poison, man?
What's the reason for you being
in the situation you're in?
Red Devil?
Me too.
I'm thinking if I gave you some
money now,
you'd go straight back to Peccancy
Street and score some Red.
I'd spend it on food. I'd get a
room for the night.
I'd clean myself up
and I'd go and visit my mother.
Then, I find my oldest brother and
I tell him how much I miss him.
You see, sir, under normal
circumstances, you'd be 100% correct.
Under normal circumstances,
I'd be in some doorway somewhere,
Red running through my veins,
but for the first time in years,
I'm clean. I can't understand why,
but suddenly I can see beyond my next fix.
What happens when the drought is over?
Will you go back to the doorway?
Nobody can give up Red.
I have. I've given up Red.
I'm sure you think you have.
No, no, you don't understand. Earlier
tonight, I was on my search for food.
I was head first inside a dustbin and I
found this, I found this. I found this.
I haven't even had the slightest urge.
I can't understand why.
I was going to throw it away, but,
I thought maybe I could exchange it
for some bread, maybe,
or some noodles or something. That's okay.
What's your name?
It's William.
William, where did you get this, huh?
Where has it been?
It was just outside the weed
house.
What weed house, where?
Hugo's greenhouse on Apparition
Avenue.
My big, strong,
handsome man.
What's got you so chirpy?
Defending my honor. Are you
ready for tonight?
I will be once I've finished
reading the news.
Right, I'll let you read your
stupid news.
No, it's not that. It's just, there are lot
of important things happening in the world.
Just keeping abreast.
Do you think I'll make a good
mother?
Ella, I think you are going to be the
most perfect mother in the whole world.
Oscar, I have a confession to
make.
What is it? Please don't
tell me the child isn't mine.
What? I'm not your mother.
Don't speak to me like that, okay?
All right, I'm sorry.
How fucking dare you?
I'm sorry.
I love you, Oscar, don't talk
to me like that.
And I love you, Ella, with all
my heart.
What was it you wanted to tell
me?
I don't want you getting upset.
What is it?
It's about your vision.
What about it?
Do you think Barry might be
right, that you were just dreaming?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no.
Just, that I know you're enjoying doing
what we do, but it's okay, I like it, too.
Ella, I knew long before we were ever
married that I have a lust for violence
and I knew from the instant
I saw you all those years ago,
as I tortured your former lover and
you lay masturbating on the floor,
that you are an
erotophonophiliac.
But the instant God came down to
me,
I realized it was our calling.
This whole thing is our destiny.
It just sounds a little crazy
when you say it out loud.
You're overthinking.
Besides, you heard what Barry said.
This is the first fresh targe
t in over two weeks.
Our mission is almost complete,
so let's have a little fun tonight.
Fun? Why, what are we going to
do?
You know what I'm going to do.
No, I don't. Say it.
I'm going to take every gram
of Red that cunt has.
Not that. Say what I like.
I'm not going to say it.
Say it. Say it, Oscar.
I'm going to blow that fucker's
brains out.
Johnny.
Anthony.
I want an eighth.
Yes, no problem. Well, come in.
Take the weight off your feet.
Want a cup of coffee?
No, that's the thing, I don't want to
come in, Hugo. I don't want a coffee,
I don't want to hear
about the bullshit stories,
the ancestry of your plants,
anything to do with your plants.
Fuck your plants and fuck
Purple Rabbits, actually.
The thought of you and me
sitting around in that shithole,
listening to Purple Rabbits,
is my living hell, mate.
You do sell the best bud in
town, don't you?
Yes, you do. Here I am tolerating
you for the minimum timeframe
I can possible endure you for
because I've had a really long,
hard day, mate, and I just want
to get stoned.
I'll have an eighth of your
strongest, man, please.
Fuck. Oh, no, please. No,
please, please, please.
If you ever come round here
again with that level of rudeness,
I promise you, I'll kill you.
I'm really sorry, mate. Just
take what you want,
I'm sorry, it won't happen again.
It was just a rough day.
You respect your elders, you
hear me?
I hear you, man. I hear you, I
hear you.
Good.
Can I get that eighth, though,
at all, please?
Fuck off.
All right.
What's his problem, man?
These kids nowadays,
they got no fucking manners.
See, the problem lies at home
with a lack of discipline.
Sometimes life has to hand out those
lessons that his father should've told him.
Now, you keep this on your
waist, close to you.
See, Covet County is a dangerous
place for a man in your work,
but you're special, Hugo. You
know that, don't you?
Everybody out there wants what you've
got, so you protect it.
I'm a lover, not a fighter.
No, it's just, he's just a kid.
He's just after bud.
Hugo. Hey. How are you?
Nice seeing you, hot guy, come
here.
Come here. Come here, give me a
hug, come on.
We just want the Red and the
money,
then we'll be out of your hair as
quick as you can say "Geronimo".
Fucking Geronimo.
Are you fucking with me?
We want all the money and every
speck of Red.
If you're very well-behaved,
then you won't end up dead.
Now, don't shoot, don't shoot.
Don't shoot, don't, don't, don't.
[MUSIC]
[GUN SHOT]
This is fucked up.
Don't be such a baby.
Now, they would've taken your money,
your children and probably your life.
This, this is the best outcome.
He was a fucking customer.
Just relax and get rid of them.
A scandal like this could hurt your
reputation amongst the middle classes.
I'm not sure.
Relax, it's just a customer.
Hello, mate. Is it all right if
I come in?
Oh, man, it's just, it's a bit
messy.
Don't worry about mess, you
should see my place.
Well, yes, I suppose so. Come
in.
What's all this,
if you don't mind me asking, of course?
We're hunters.
Hunters. Hunters, like pigeons
and rabbits.
Badgers.
Come. All right, come on in.
Come, come, come in, please.
Please come. Here you go, here
you go, here you go.
What are you after?
Whatever.
I've got some sensational new bud.
It's called Triple Cream Dream.
Well, actually, Hugo...
Oh, is all right to call you Hugo?
Well, only my friends call me
Hugo.
That must mean we're friends,
then.
Right.
Hugo, my friend, I need some
Red, some Red Devil.
That's not cool, man. That drug is
a gift to the streets from the devil.
If it's not a plant you can grow
on God's green earth,
I'm not interested, mate.
You see, well, you need that manmade shit.
Let me roll you a big fat one.
Yes, and you'll forget all
about that Red bullshit.
Hugo, Red actually does come
from a plant.
What?
A rare plant that comes from
the top of some
volcanic mountain or something.
I don't know, it's something I've heard.
How do you know that?
Common knowledge.
This is my friend, Gabriel.
We've been friends for, well, years.
What happened to your arm?
I don't want to talk about it.
No, we'll talk about whatever
I want to talk about.
You're in my house, you little
motherfucker and I make the rules in here.
It's my house.
Look, if you're trying to
test me out to make sure
I'm on the level, I'm a cool
cat, all right, man?
You'll have problems from me.
I'm regular, you'll earn a small fortune from
my custom. Come on, Hugo, man, you'll see.
Let me blow this little devil dog away
now and we can bury him with the other two.
My friend don't like you, man.
Your trust will be your downfall, Hugo.
I have told you this before.
Enough with the talking,
it's time for the bang, bang.
Oh, don't be such a spoilsport.
He seems a cool guy.
This is probably why people
don't come round here.
Hugo, dude, who the fuck are
you talking to?
My friend.
What is it then?
You fucking tripping or do you
actually think you can see someone?
You know Gabriel is not real,
don't you, Hugo?
What is real, man?
Real is knowing when a customer
is lying to me to get free bud
or real is being lonely enough
to let it happen in the hope
that someone might actually want
to sit and socialize with me.
See, real is knowing that
when someone wants to steal
something from me
as precious as your children,
well, even a pacifist has the
right to defend them, yes?
Now, if that means I have to
hide behind an imaginary friend
to do something that I don't
want to do, eh?
Well, fuck it, man.
[MUSIC]
[GUNSHOTS]
[GUNSHOTS]
Real is knowing from the minute
I opened the door to you
that you was probably high on
Red.
Real, you see, is deep down
hoping
that you would want to get to
know me,
end up liking me and wanting to
be my friend.
See, we could chill out together, smoke
some Js, listen to some Purple Rabbits.
Well, I could tell you stories.
Well, fucking no stories,
but real is being so fucking high
I don't even know if you exist.
It takes more than knowing someone's
name to be their friend, Hugo.
Shut up.
What next?
Well, now you've got two
choices.
First, we forget that this ever
happened, yes,
and you flush that Red
Devil shit down the toilet
and I introduce you to Mr.
Triple Cream Dream.
Well, what about the second?
You hold on to that Red and
I'll shoot you dead.
I think I'll leave,
if that's all right with you, Hugo.
No, no, tell me.
What is it about me that makes it
so difficult to socialize with?
Wait.
Have you got any Red Devil?
[GUNSHOT]
Burn in hell, you crazy cunt.
