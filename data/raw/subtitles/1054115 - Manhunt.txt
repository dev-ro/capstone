Don't go far!
- How are we doing?
- I'll have a look.
Hey, do you mind?
You're sitting on the map!
Wake up, dude!
- I'd say it's about four hours.
- Till we're there?
To the parking area,
then we walk from there.
I'm gonna get you for this!
Piss off!
This will do you good!
You too, brother!
Yeah, especially you.
Comic book nerd!
Are you OK? Any vipers?
Don't say that!
Just you wait, on the hiking trail
there'll be vipers and spiders and..
- Yeah, right.
- ... gnats, cockroaches...
Quit screwing around!
I'm just kidding!
Yeah, he always does that.
Haven't you noticed?
- You don't have to take all that crap
- Especially not from him.
You shut the hell up,
no one's talking to you!
Mia, shove a sock or something
in your ugly brother's mouth.
- I say we get moving again, alright?
- Yeah, okay, we'll move along.
Just pull it towards you,
I can do it.
Let's find the rules
and read them aloud!
Daddy's advice, One:
Follow the red ribbons.
If we part,
they'll lead us to the road.
Two: Remember not to part,
'cause it ain't smart.
Three: Daddy very much
prefers Mia to Jørgen.
Please, let's do rules later -
- and enjoy ourselves instead!
But we are enjoying ourselves!
I'm really going to miss Camilla.
Imagine,
you'll be gone a whole year!
I'm so proud of you for
being accepted at that school.
- There's no reception out here!
- Well, maybe there is now.
- There is no reception, just noise!
- Won't hurt to try...
I'm just gonna fill the tank.
You guys order some food.
- Let's go together.
- Okay.
- Where's the restroom?
- Over there!
So I'll just order for all of us?
Oi! Roger!
- Lovely!
- Not quite...
It'll have to do for now.
- Oh!
- What is it?
- There's a man in here!
- What's he doing in there?
I don't know... Excuse me?
You can use mine, I'll hurry up.
He doesn't respond...
Excuse me? Are you okay?
- What happened?
- He scratched me!
- Does it hurt?
- Yes!
Hey! Get out of here!
Hey! Get out, you souse!
Get out!
- Does it hurt?
- Yes...
You better rinse it right away.
Come here...
- Ahh, that stings!
- I know, but it'll pass.
- What would I do without you?
- Who knows? There!
Turn on the tap!
- You okay? Feeling better?
- Yeah.
But...
- How are you doing?
- You mean me and Roger?
We're fine, why do you ask?
In the car and all,
he's been quite negative.
- To whom? Towards me?
- Yeah, towards everyone.
He can be a bit negative sometimes,
but he does care for me.
I don't see
why you bring this up now.
It's about respect.
I'm fond of you and...
Please! You've said it
a thousand times already!
OK, I'll shut up about it.
But please do me a favor?
Stand up to Roger
if he's mean to you?
- Promise?
- Promise!
Let's eat!
Hey, you!
You dropped something.
Hey! He's talking to you!
She dropped something...
Fucking city slickers.
- Hey, what's that you said?
- Please don't...
Those inbred retards!
- Roger, knock it off!
- Look at them! Fucking idiots.
Having fun?
Busy screwing pigs and...
Screw them...
God!
You're on your own
if there's trouble!
There...
- Oh, sorry! I forgot.
- That's OK.
Think of all that wonderful food
you're missing out on!
I can't even stand the thought of it,
those poor animals...
Good thing our bags
are full of baked beans, then.
I'm not sharing a tent with you!
What happened to you?
A drunk in the restroom.
Mia treated it.
- Who?
- Don't know.
I took care of it,
so it's not a problem.
Is everyone out here
a fucking retard, or what?
I chased him away,
it's not a problem...
Sorry.
Just relax. I'll take care of it.
- Hey, it's not that exciting.
- Look at her!
It's not our business...
Hey Roger! See anything you like?
Are you mad?
She didn't mean anything by it,
just wants everyone to have a good time.
They're lucky to be with us,
in my car!
We all chip in for gas.
They've been looking forward
to spending time with us.
- Are you sure you still want this?
- Well, we're here now.
- We could make up some excuse.
- I said it's OK.
Honey! You...
They really can't stand me.
No, they can't, you know.
You're misunderstanding this,
I'm sure.
Once we leave the cramped car
and get on the trail,
it'll be just us hiking in the woods.
We're gonna have a great time!
It'll be a fucking pain. Come autumn,
you'll leave me here alone.
Great!
Dear, if that's how you feel, you
might have said something earlier?
I didn't mean it that way...
OK.
What's up with the drunk
in the restroom? Did he hit on you?
No, he just scratched me by chance
when he awoke.
You know
I'm looking after you, right?
Yeah, I know.
You're the best!
- No, you're the best!
- No, you are!
You are.
- Shall we go back in?
- Okay.
Oh, there you are!
Let's go buy some food for the road.
- Are you coming along?
- I'll just finish this.
I'll go with you!
Let's see...
Chocolate, some soft drinks...
...Coke... some gum, perhaps...
- Chocolate.
- I've said that.
Chocolate to survive the rough hike.
Well, I need it!
I certainly don't need any meat.
Baked beans for all, then...
Yeah, I think I have to eat it,
as an extra...
One more krone...
- There you go.
- Thanks.
This is Renate.
We're heading in the same direction.
Her car broke down,
so we can give her a lift.
- I didn't see any cars by the road.
- The car has been picked up.
- They didn't give you a ride?
- They went the other way.
- I really don't mean to impose.
- That's OK, you're coming with us.
Excuse me,
we need to talk about this.
We can't pick up anybody
along the road.
- But we're going her way!
- We have no idea who she is!
I've read about hitch-hikers
attacking drivers, stealing stuff...
Where?
In your Donald Duck comics?
It's hardly dangerous.
We are three grown-ups, plus you...
She's coming with us.
Camilla agrees!
Let her speak for herself, for once!
That goes for your brother as well!
I haven't spoken for him once!
I really didn't mean to impose.
- It's just that we're in a hurry
and... - The car is mine!
- It's OK, isn't it?
- No...
Damn!
Hey, wait!
We'll give you a ride.
Excuse me, that's my seat.
You okay?
Sorry, no offence.
I just want to be careful,
you know?
Where are you headed?
Where are you going?
I don't know.
Yes! Music!
Inger Lise Rypdal!
Radio signals at last,
and then it's this crap!
Goddamn sons of bitches!
Don't do that!
Can we stop? I don't feel so good.
Sure, we can stop right over here.
Oh, shit!
Did anything get on the seat?
- My comic book...
- Eewww.
Look at her.
Poor thing is all messed up.
- I can see how you're looking at her.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- "Do you want me to stop?"
- Shut up!
Don't pretend I'm mean to you.
Quit exaggerating. I mean it!
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm sick and tired of your behavior.
- Give me the keys!
- Say you're sorry!
- It's my car!
- You're treating Camilla like shit!
- Mia!
- No, he deserves this!
- Say you're sorry!
- The hell I will!
Acting tough?
Come on, say you're sorry!
- The hell I will!
- Say you're sorry!
Goddamn you, you fucking bitch!
If I don't find those keys,
you'll be sorry!
"If I don't find those keys,
you'll be sorry!"
I really shouldn't be laughing...
- He sort of had it coming...
- It was a bit...
- He had it coming.
- We have to go.
- What's the matter?
- We have to get away from here.
We were going to, but Mia
threw the keys away, so...
- Hey, what's the matter?
- Nothing...
- Hi...
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean all that...
- What's the matter?
- They took him.
- They have him...
- What are you talking about?
If you're hurt,
we'll get you to the police.
Mia, can I talk to you?
Now, please.
Sit here, girl.
Let's help Roger find the keys
so we can get out of here.
- No, he can do that himself.
- He can do that himself?
You threw the keys away.
You help him find them!
Can't you see that I'm busy with...
If she's hurt,
we must get her to a hospital -
- or to the police or something,
instead of just arguing.
- Okay.
- Quit being so damn childish.
Well, he deserved it.
Hi...
It's okay, sit down.
Get away! Scram! Run, damn it!
Get the hell out of here!
What's going on?
Hey!
Are you alive?
Let go of my brother! Let him go!
Are you laughing?
What is your problem? Let her go!
We haven't done anything!
Okay, I'll get that girl
to a fucking hospital myself!
Mia!
Help!
- What's happening? Where are we?
- I don't know.
- What the fuck is happening?
- I don't know what's happened.
Where the hell are we?
- Helloooo!
- Be quiet, you have to stay quiet.
But we have to call for help...
- Jørgen...
- Jørgen, hey, wake up!
What's going on?
Wait!
Hey...
Hey!
Hey!
Jørgen!
I can't untie the one in the back.
Holy shi..!
Oh my God...
Run!
Run, damn it!
What do we do now?
The main road must be close.
I think it's in that direction.
I ain't climbing down there.
We're not climbing straight down.
We go sideways and shit.
No way I'm going down there.
- What about him?
- He'll be dead in a minute anyway!
We can't get him down that way.
We need to think of something else.
He started it, fucking cunt!
I blame you for us being here,
you and your fucking sister!
What the fuck are you saying?
Are you insane?
Roger! Are you crazy?
We're four people here.
We need to keep our cool, okay?
- Just give me two seconds.
- We don't have two seconds!
Camilla?
Camilla?
Goddamn it!
What do we do?
- Roger?
- Shhhhh.
- Roger!
- Shhh! Shut up!
Where'd he go?
- Roger!
- Shut the fuck up! Are you stupid?
Roger!
- I think he fucking left us.
- No, he didn't.
So where is he? He's fucking gone!
He left us alone, with this guy...
- Don't say that!
- How typical!
Camilla, we have to go!
I won't leave Roger! No way!
He's gone! We have to leave now!
Camilla...
You okay?
Two seconds...
Come on...
We just left them!
We just left Roger and that boy.
We had no choice, Camilla!
You've got to be quiet!
You have got to be quiet.
Okay?
- Should we bandage that wound?
- No, that's okay.
- Roger's gone for help.
- No, he fucking hasn't.
- Yes he has! He's my boyfriend!
- Be quiet!
Camilla, come here...
Is he gone?
I think so...
Let's go back where we came from...
- No chance.
- It's right next to the road!
Are you nuts?
We can't go back there!
- They're probably waiting for us!
- No.
- Let's stay here for a while.
- No, we need to go back!
- We can't go back.
- Roger's there! Next to the road.
No way he's there!
If he's gone, he's gone.
Hello?
I heard something...
They're here...
Let go of him...
Let go of him!
What the hell are you doing?
Don't! Please!
Let me go!
I don't want to die...
I'll do anything, I promise!
Let me go...
- Get him, Camilla! Do it!
- Shut up!
Camilla...
Can you help me out of this?
Please?
Hello?
Camilla? Help me...
Hurry up! Help me!
Quickly! Hurry up, damn it!
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Hey! Come back, you bitch!
Do as I tell you! Camilla!
Camilla!
Hey!
Jørgen...
Jørgen!
Be quiet!
I'll be right back...
It's over.
Can you stand up?
Noooo!
Noooo!
Stop...
Stop...
You have to help me, please!
You have to help me!
You have to help me..!
Get in.
Hey now...
- What happened?
- The others are all dead...
Someone attacked us!
But I killed them...
I killed them!
