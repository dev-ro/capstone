Eileen, you got more support there
than the Arsenal.
At least l ain't got bee stings for tits.
Oh, all right. Cheeky.

Desmond Dekker stirring up a storm
with ''lsraelites''
on the hottest day of the year
so far.
So girls, don't forget your bikinis
and try and stay cool.
Here we go.
Connie? When you get a moment,
can you just have a walkthrough?
Just give me five minutes
to settle in.
Morning. Morning, morning.
Everything all right?
Yeah, l overslept.
How's George?
Don't ask.
l've been up half the night.
You're all right, you've got time.
Man!
Ladies, if l could
interrupt you a second...
Come on. Cover up.
ALBERT: Please, ladies behave.
Cover yourselves.
Cover yourselves up.
WOMAN: Oh, here he is.
What if your husbands saw you?
What would they say, eh?
Come on, girls,
this is important!
Thank you, Connie. Thank you.
Shut up! Now, shut up.
Do you wanna hear
what l gotta say or not?
Yeah.
Right.
Now, listen.
To quote
Winston Churchill himself,
this ain't the end. lt ain't even
the beginning of the end.
Oh, for fuck's sake, get on with it.
WOMAN: Get on!
Look, ladies, please.
l'm doing me best.
Oh, come on.
Now, the deadline
we set the management
to respond to our complaint
about how they've
regraded you unskilled--
Shh!
--has now passed. Shut up!
Which means you've gotta vote
on the threat we made
in the original communiqué.
An immediate ban
on all overtime. Right?
And a one-day stoppage
to take place on the 29th of May.
All right? You got that? Right, now,
those for industrial action,
hands up.
Yes.
Against?
Full house!
l'm seeing the management
tomorrow morning,
and l shall inform them
of your decision.
WOMAN:
lsn't he gorgeous?
We did it.
First time for everything.
Fuck them. Every other
bugger goes on strike,
why shouldn't we?
Just don't put it like that
if you get interviewed by David Frost.
David Frost.
l know what you think about him.
lt's a bit scary, isn't it?
l feel quite proud of us.
You should.
l fought Rommel in the war,
you know?
l wasn't once scared
like l am when l walk
in there, l tell you.
EDDlE: Happy birthday, Sandra.
SANDRA: Thanks, Eddie.
lsn't it lovely what they did?
Come on, get up.
Are you coming, George?
No.
Go on then.
Come on, you come.
Connie.
MAN:
Spoilsport.
Happy birthday, darling.
Thanks.
WOMAN: Happy birthday.
Have a wonderful time.
Thanks, Albert.
Oh, leave it out, Dave!
lt's all right, it's the fuse box.
Calm down.
Of course it's the bleeding fuse box.
ALBERT: Right.
Oh, no, here he goes.
ALBERT:
Altogether now.
lt's bloody Liberace.
Oh, God.
Where do you reckon
Brenda's got to?
Where do you think?
You're joking.
No.
Your trim. That'll be hanging
right off in a week or two.
And l bet l know the girl
what sewed it, and all.
Come on, then.
Chop-chop,
or we'll miss the buffet.
Want another one, anyone?
l'll have one.
Yeah.
George?
No.
l'll be up all night.
Come on, mate.
Connie, yeah?
Yeah, yeah. Please.
Come on.
Just a little one.
G & T, half a mild. Dave? Salt.
Whole lemons.
Who's next on the dance floor?
You sure you don't
wanna sit down, Sandra?
Are you joking? l want a snowball.
George, you ain't even
tripped the old, uh... Come on.
No, no, no. lt's all right.
Please.
Do you mind, George,
if l have this one?
Like to keep me hand in.
Jitterbug, twist, all them.
You be careful.
We need you
on top form tomorrow.
What you talking about?
MAN 1 :
Fantastic.
No, no, no. Not being funny.
MAN 2: All right. All right.
RlTA: Good night.
EDDlE: Thanks.
Sandra. Sandra.
Sleep well.
Sandra.
Happy birthday.
Good night.
EDDlE: Be good.
SANDRA:
Hang on. l don't live here.
Wait.
What?
Now, what was that for?
Nothing. l just like you, that's all.
Yeah? Come here.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Not out here.
You're better than that, are you?
Actually, yeah, l am.
Graham?
Graham. Breakfast.
There you go.
l don't feel very well.
Don't you?
You're not hot.
lt's my stomach.
Okay, what's wrong
with your hand?
Nothing.
Well, give us a look, then.
No.
l never done nothing. Honest.
Mr. Clarke again?
lt'll be fine, okay?
Now, eat some breakfast
and get dressed. l'll deal with it.
Sharon? Chop-chop.
Eddie. Come on, lover boy.
No, no, just clear off, l'm dying.
We're all dying.
We've all gotta go to work.
Eddie?
Oh, you cheeky cow. Come here.
God.
Balls.
Balls, balls, balls. Bollocks.
Yes?
Mr. Clarke?
Can l have a word?
Of course. How can l help?
You hit my son.
On his hand. Caned him.
And it ain't the first time.
Yes. O'Grady. l remember.
Forgot his protractor.
And it isn't the first ti--
Don't care whether it's
the hundredth time.
l don't want you doing it.
You live on the estate,
don't you?
l don't see what that's got--
We find boys
who come to us from the estate
often have difficulty
in adjusting to the standards of
behavior required in a school like this.
lt isn't really their fault.
Their parents have never undergone
the full rigor of academic life.
The boys can hardly look to them
for guidance, can they?
But they do adapt in time.
And l'm sure your son will too,
if he's just given the chance.
But thank you for your concern,
Mrs. O'Grady.
Are you all right?
Fuck off.
Hold on, is this Sandra's?
Yeah, l know.
Connie? Con?
Sandra's at it again, look.
You've gotta say something.
She hasn't.
You've gotta talk to her.
Don't wave at us, silly cow.
We're moaning about you.
l'll do it.
No, you can't keep covering for her.
l'll talk to her.
Will you?
Here it comes. Oh, no.
WOMAN 1 :
Look at that. We might as well
not have a roof.
WOMAN 2:
How many times have we asked
to fix this?
lt's not difficult, is it?
Connie, listen.
Albert.
l'm sorry, l didn't realize. Oh, my God.
l didn't realize. l'm sorry. Oh, God.
CONNlE: You were saying?
There's a meeting tomorrow.
At Ford's headquarters
down in Warley.
You're joking.
l'm not.
Machinists threatening strike action,
they couldn't believe it.
WOMAN: Oh, yes.
ALBERT: Yeah.
We'll have to make a good strategy.
They'll have Hopkins and Jones
and Grant, miserable sod.
Now, who have we got
on our side? We've got, um,
Monty Taylor
from the head office,
he's coming.
There's me, two. You, Con, three.
Well, that leaves us one short.
Why?
Little principle l picked up
in the war, Eileen.
Turn up with more on your side
than they've got on their side
and turn up
when they're least expecting it.
So who's gonna
make the fourth man?
Oh, not me.
l'm not going.
Any takers? No?
You want it?
Fuck off.
Come on. lt's a day off.
Oh, actually.
ALBERT: Yeah, you all wanna go now.
Yeah. l ain't having that.
What?
WOMEN: Yeah.
Go on, Rita. Day off.
Go on, Rita.
You'd be great, Rita.
Go on, then.
Yeah, right.
What do you have to do?
All right, Gordon?
Hello, Sandra.
Think you're going?
lt's the new Escort. Finally designed
something people like.
They can get fucked.
That's right.
We ain't working no overtime.
Me and the boys were saying
we'd have gone on strike
just having to turn up
in a pig hole like this.
You know it's raining here, don't you?
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.
See you tomorrow, Connie.
WOMAN: l think he likes you.

lt's going, it's going. The police
are being pushed backwards.
There's screaming now.
Absolute hysteria.
Now you can see the banners
are being used as clubs--
WOMAN:
No, they don't want so much.
No, look what you're doing...
Sharon?
Don't open my share.
Turn the telly off now,
there's a good girl. Now, please.
Wake your dad up.
Wake up, Dad.
Right. Pull your finger out.
Help your mum.
Square eyes,
what have l told you?
Dad, Martine Clarke's got color.
l've seen it.
Martine Clarke's
got color, has she?
We'll go around her house
and watch it after tea, won't we?
Her mum'll be
pleased.
Look, we'll have color soon.
Once you can rent them.
Eddie, don't go promising color.
We haven't even paid
for the fridge yet.
And the three piece
is still on tick.
Now we've got all this unrest at work.
What unrest?
Oh, that? You had a vote, Rita.
Unrest is when you actually
come out and strike. Blimey.
No, don't look like that.
l'm only joking.
All right.
l'm proud of you.
We all are, aren't we?
Sticking to your guns.
We had a book going
on the shop floor.
No one thought you'd
even take the vote so,
yeah, good on you. Well done.
Ain't just a vote now.
Got a meeting tomorrow,
all the bosses.
And l'm going.
Oh?
lt's all right,
l'll plate your tea up
in the morning
and then if l'm back late,
you can just heat it through.
Apparently, you go to a Berni lnn
on the way there.
That's snazzy.
lsn't it?
RlTA:
lt'll be all right, won't it?
Yeah, of course.
We don't have to do anything.
The men will do all the talking.
RlTA:
No, l mean, it's not too posh
in there, is it?
l'm wearing the right stuff?
No, you'll be fine.
l'm so glad you're here.
After you, ladies.
Gentlemen.
Thank you.
WOMAN: Here you are, sir.
MAN: Lovely.
ALBERT:
Do you ever worry about your waist?
MONTY:
You're joking.
That steak.
Béarnaise sauce.
lt's Monty. He always
insists on coming here.
As long as
the union's paying.
Rita.
Yeah.
Word of advice.
When we get there,
don't let them lure you in.
lf they seem to be
asking you a question,
keep your head down.
l'll handle it.
Above all, if l nod, you nod.
Got that?
Right.
That nice, was it?
lt's lovely, thank you.
l couldn't eat another thing.
Oh. Mr. Dawson. l'm sorry,
we weren't expecting you until--
lt's quite all right. lt's no problem.
Oh, and there's four of us.
You might need an extra chair.
Right.
WOMAN:
Two teas.
On a previous
occasion,
in a free vote, the girls agreed
to the new grading structure.
They did not agree, however,
as to where they would end up on it.
Which is why we're sitting
round this table.
Look, l understand what the girls
are saying. l just don't--
l'd rather you didn't
speak for the girls,
Mr. Hopkins.
None of us here knows
what's in their heads.
HOPKlNS:
The fact remains there's a formal
grievance procedure in place
and the machinists' case
will be heard.
What we can't do
is let them jump the queue.
Peter, look,
you know me.
l ain't got no ax
to grind with Ford.
Am l right or am l right?
HOPKlNS: You've always been fair.
Exactly. Ah,
we're all men of the world.
Let's cut to the chase,
shall we? We'll reconvene
in two weeks' time.
ALBERT: Monty.
Listen.
We'll reconvene, we'll come back
down here again for the day
and then at that point
you can guarantee
to look into the girls' complaint.
The thing is, Monty--
That way
you can go back to
your bosses and say
that the strike's off
because of how
you've handled
today's negotiations.
We can go back to
the girls and say they're now
your number-one priority
in a few weeks' time.
That seems very fair.
l'm not so sure
the girls'll be too happy.
The girls
will be fine.
As long as they know
they're not being fobbed off
by the management.
The union's setting the terms.
That's what's important.
Bollocks.
What?
l'm sorry, Albert, but it is.
Three hours we've been sat here.
''That's what matters to the girls''?
How you qualify
to talk about that,
l do not know.
Here. Have a look at this.
There.
You put them together.
Go on.
lt's Ford property, l believe.
Oh, stop it.
We have to take these
different pieces and work out
how they go together.
Because there ain't no template,
is there?
We have to take them and sew them
all freehand into the finished article.
The same with the door trim
and God knows what else.
That is not unskilled work,
which is how you've regraded us.
Christ, you need
to take an exam
to get on our line.
Please, miss, l--
No, it's Mrs. O'Grady.
Mrs. O'Grady,
l understand your grievance--
Well, l really don't think you do.
lt's not difficult, though.
We're entitled to semi-skilled
and the wages what go with it.
Bring this to the meeting--
Hang on.
And as regards to this
queue-jumping business, well,
we put this complaint in
months ago, didn't we?
lt's just
you've done nothing about it.
And we all know why.
That's because women
have never been
on strike before, isn't it?
You just thought you could
forget it and we'd all go away.
Well, l'm sorry,
but it isn't gonna be
that easy because we're
not going anywhere.
We're gonna do
what we said we would.
No more overtime and
an immediate 2 4-hour stoppage.
And where it goes from there,
well, it's up to you.
lf you'll excuse me,
l've really got to be going.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Thank you.
You think l like looking stupid?
l didn't know what she was gonna do.
MONTY:
You didn't know they were
in her handbag, pull them out?
Look at his face.
Oh, don't worry, you were great.
MONTY:
Thank you very much, Albert.
Thank you very much.
l knew, l knew.
lt's up here, you see.
l wanted clever, Rita,
that's why l picked you.
Oh, stop it.
When you pulled out these cuttings,
oh, that was amazing.
lt was. l never expected that,
that you'd come prepared.
Oh, no, he was right.
l was nicking them.
Yeah, Eddie uses them to patch
the tent up for when we go camping.
All the same. Listen, don't worry about
Monty, l'll handle him. Don't worry.
Can l have them back?
Oh, yeah.
Cheers.
What are you gonna say to them?
You tell them.
You what?
This is your fault.
All right. Hold that.
Right.
Everybody out.
WOMAN:
l can't believe it.
lt's all right.
l could do
with a cup of tea.
CONNlE:
l could do with something
a lot stronger than that.
Now, l realize this is
my first day in the job
and it may be
that l am missing something here,
but when we were elected
two years ago,
it was on a wave
of optimism
that Labour would utilize
its close relationship
with the unions
to develop manufacturing industry
so that it would better serve
the employer
and the employee.
Yes, l think that was
in the manifesto.
lt was. Trust me.
So, what have you been doing
since 1 966?
l--
Two years this department has had
in which
to make a difference.
Shall we see what
has been achieved
in the last 1 2 months?
Twenty-six thousand strikes
in the United Kingdom,
with the resulting loss
of 5 million working days.
Unions and management
barely talking to each other,
productivity levels
through the floor,
and our balance of payments,
the wrong side of catastrophic.
lt's hardly the stuff to set
the champagne corks popping, is it?
Thank you.
See yourselves out.
Here you are, babes,
you forgot your flask.
l love you Dave, cheers.
You too, darling. Good luck.
You get stuck in, girls.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Monica, that's yours.
Cheers, love.
Happy with that.
WOMAN:
lt's a holiday.
EDDlE:
What's this? A mothers' meeting?
Hey, cheeky sod. Are you all right?
How you getting on?
Give us half a chance.
Good luck.
See you later.
Come on, ladies, let's hear you.
Bye. See you later.
Cheers, Eddie.
What have you done to your eyes?
lt's amazing, isn't it?
My friend showed me how.
Scouts everywhere.
That's how Twiggy
got discovered.
Up west, you dozy sod,
not Dagenham.
You never know.
We'd better shut this gate.
l've spelt it right,
haven't l?
Close the gate.
l know.
At least they know we're serious, eh?
Not as helpless as they thought.
Come on then, girls.
No more seats today, Mr. Ford.
Come on, girls, let's get together.
What if we form a line or something?
Line up there.
Yeah.
CONNlE:
Hold the banners up.
We need some in the back.
WOMAN 1 : Standing?
WOMAN 2: Like that.
WOMAN 3: Come on, then.
That's it.
Here we go.
Like this?
Yeah.
They're running low
on finished seats.
So get these down
to the Cortina line,
then come back for the Escorts.
They're calling.
Come on.
Anyone fancy a cuppa?
Yeah.
Tea's up, ladies.
Come on.
Yeah, put that down a bit.
That's gonna
hurt your arms.
Get me Tooley.
Stand by, girls, could be trouble.
Hello, girls.
WOMAN: What's Brenda got?
BRENDA:
Tea's up. Bananas, apples, pears,
the lot.
Thanks for the ride, Arthur.
He's lovely.
Brenda, you never.
BRENDA: Why not? He's gorgeous.
WOMAN: l would.
Just as l was leaving with the fruit,
he goes:
''l believe all the workers of the world
should unite.'' So l thought:
''l can help you
with that one straight away.''
So l did.
Hey, Peter. Bobby here.
What can l do for you?
We've got another dispute,
l'm afraid.
Another one? Who is it this week?
lt's the women.
CONNlE:
Quick. Quick, quick.
Come along, girls.
You're gonna get soaked, love.
RlTA:
Oh, no. They're gonna drip,
aren't they?
lt'll pass.
MONlCA: What are we gonna do now?
Pubs ain't even open.
Monica.
Just wanna have some chips.
l suppose we've done a full day,
haven't we?
WOMAN 1 : We have, haven't we?
WOMAN 2: Yeah.
l have gotta get
down the dogs later.
Yeah. l did promise my mum
l'd cook her tea.
Did you?
Yeah.
Oh, sod it. We've registered
the protest, haven't we?
Yeah.
Go on. School's out.
Yeah!
Home time.
MONlCA:
Onwards and upwards, Rita.
Well done, girls.
WOMAN 3: See you.
Hey, and Rita, well done.
lt was your gob what got us
here, wasn't it?
Sandra?
l've just been
round to your house.
l've just been round to your house.
Why?
l thought you would've
gone home ages ago.
No.
l'm lucky if l can get the lads
to hold out for a full hour.
Look, l wanted a little chat.
You fancy a cup of tea?
l can't. l'm sorry, l've got stuff to--
l'm buying.
Go on, then. Seeing as it's pelting
it down, a quick cuppa won't hurt.
Over there by the window.
Over there.
l'm dripping all over the floor.
Come on, Albert, spit it out.
Yeah.
Sorry.
lt's all right.
This dispute's got nothing to do
with what skill level you are.
Ford decided to
give you less money
because they can.
They're allowed
to pay women
a lower wage than men.
All over the country, Rita,
women are getting less
because they're women.
You'll always
come second.
You'll always be fighting
over the scraps.
Until you--
We get equal pay, yeah.
Yeah.
What l don't get is
why it's so important to you.
l got brought up by my mum.
Me and me brothers.
She worked all her life
and she paid my Aunt Lil
to take care of us during the day.
And it was hard.
Especially as she was
getting less than half
what the blokes
at the factory was getting
for doing the same work.
And there was never any question
that it could be any different.
Not for her.
Yeah.
Someone has gotta stop
these exploiting bastards
getting away with
what they've been doing for years.
And you can.
You can, Rita, believe me.
What about Connie?
l mean, she's shop steward.
We voted for her.
But this needs a leader.
Someone to inspire the girls,
to make the points clear.
And that ain't Connie.
Not at the moment.
Not with George
the way he is.
l've already spoke to her.
She's more than happy
for you to have a go.
More than.
Look, don't say nothing now.
Just sleep on it. Will you?
Do you want to wait in here?
Ey?
Do you want to wait in here?
No, you're all right.
lt's tipping it down. Please.
l'm dripping.
l know. Get in.
l'll get it all over your car.
Come in, quick, quick, quick.
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
Gosh, you're soaked.
l'm so sorry.
lt's fine.
l'll ruin your car.
We met before, actually.
Do you remember, in the corridor?
Yeah.
l've been hoping
to run into you
for a day or two, actually.
Oh, yeah?
Um...
l was wondering if you'd
sign a letter. l'm making
a formal complaint
to the headmaster about
Clarke's use of the cane.
What?
He seems to think my son--
Sorry, l mean...
You were there
for the same reason l was?
Yes. He was indiscreet enough
to mention you.
Of course.
l think he was suggesting
we were hysterical
and desperately needed
to calm down.
l had it all straight in my head
what l was gonna tell him
and what l was gonna say.
lt's just--
Oh, you can't talk to Mr. Clarke.
l mean, nobody can. He--
You have to listen.
He's a bully.
Which is why he beats them.
Yeah.
Yeah. Go on, then.
Give us a pen.
Thanks.
lt's stopped.
Yeah. That's just my luck, isn't it?
Thanks.
Look, um,
l know you're not
mentioning it because
you're being polite. lt's just...
You know, when we met in
the corridor, l was really upset,
and l never usually use
that type of language.
Don't you?
No.
Because l called Mr. Clarke
a complete cock.
Oh. Oh!
Did you? Fair enough.
Well, he is.
Here they come.
Left a bit of a puddle, now.
lt's all right,
David's getting
in the back.
That dress, l've seen it before,
it's lovely. ln Vogue.
Oh, thanks. lt's Biba.
ls it? Well...
Well, it's still gorgeous.
Have a good day, yeah?
You too. Be good.
And you.
Hell, Sandra. l think
you've had a bit of
shrinkage in the wash.
Hot pants. Mary Quants.
Give them back to her,
they look painful.
l think they look lovely.
Thanks.
lt's like what Brenda said,
isn't it? This ain't Knightsbridge,
it's Dagenham.
lf you wanna get spotted,
you gotta stand out more.
And that's exactly
what l'm gonna do.
Yesterday were great, weren't it?
RlTA: Being on strike?
Yeah.
lt's a glimpse, isn't it?
Of how it could be.
Well, that's what
it's about, isn't it?
Pitch-bleeding-black. l couldn't
see me hand in front of me face.
Finally when he turns the lights on, it
was actually stuck to me bottom lash.
WOMAN 1 :
She got fired.
Blimey.
l'm here, just. Oh, Christ.
Connie? Con?
Rita, l--
No, l just wanna say something.
Sorry, l just, um...
lf l was to get a bit more involved,
you know, with Albert,
it's only because
l've got a gob on me.
You're the heartbeat
of this place,
always have been.
Rita, look at me,
all at sixes and sevens.
You can do this and
you should.
Here we go.
Man!
Brian.
Hello, Brian.
ls that a cotton bob in your pocket
or a hard-on?
WOMAN 1 : What's he doing?
WOMAN 2: Having a fiddle.
Here, Con. Pass them out, girls.
WOMAN 1 : Yeah, come on, Rita.
Go on, Rita. Give them hell.
lgnore it.
lgnore it?
Standard issue,
day after a walkout.
Have you
seen the language?
''Your aggressive disregard
for the existing complaints procedure.''
Tone of that?
They don't mean it.
So why are they saying it?
That's how we've always done it.
All the other strikes.
lt's like the rules.
RlTA:
Oh, no, no, no. l'm sorry.
Sorry, we ain't
playing that game.
We ain't your men.
We're us.
And we certainly won't be
addressed in this manner.
No.
All those in favor
of not only maintaining
but increasing our current action
by going to an all-out stoppage
until we get the same rates of pay
as the men?
What?
Equal pay?
Why not?
Because that's what this
is really about, isn't it?
We're on the lowest rate
in the whole factory
despite the fact
we've got considerable skill.
And there's only one possible
reason for that.
lt's because we're women.
Yeah.
And in the workplace,
women get paid less
no matter what skill they got.
Which is why, from now on,
we gotta demand a level playing field
and rates of pay
which reflect the job,
not whether you've got
a dick or not.
This strike is about one thing
and one thing only: fairness.
WOMAN 1 : Yeah.
WOMAN 2: That's right.
Equal pay or nothing.
Yes.
All those in favor?
Yes.
Everybody out.
Well, it's got
nothing to do with me.
An all-out stoppage?
Also, the specifics
of this strike, they've
widened out a bit.
Christ.
Shit.
Fucking Ada. Equal pay?
What were you thinking, Monty?
lt wasn't me, it was Albert.
He went behind me back.
Really, Monty?
He's a loose cannon.
You wanna haul someone
over the coals, he's your man.
The bloody troublemaker.
Get him in.
l tried to protect you, Albert.
But you're gonna get
such a fucking bollocking.
Come on, then.
This is awkward, Albert.
You know that, don't you?
lt jeopardizes a whole raft
of other negotiations
that the unions are already at
loggerheads with management over.
Look, comrade,
basically, you encouraging
these women to get all militant--
lt shifts resources
away from the blokes,
who are the ones at the coalface.
We ain't unsympathetic,
but as a union, we have
to remember who comes first.
The Communist Party
and Marx himself said:
''Men write their own history.''
That's ''men,'' Albert.
But didn't he also say,
''Progress can be measured
by the social position of
the female sex''?
Or was that a different Marx?
That was Groucho, was it?
Equal pay across the board.
You telling me that
ain't worth fighting for?
Of course it is.
And you know it.
l'll tell you something.
This Rita has got a bigger set of balls
than you three put together.
And she ain't scared to
lay them on the line neither.
And l, for one, am gonna help her.
And if you are
what you say you are,
an organization pledged
to support its members,
then you'll get off your lazy, fat arses
and you'll help her too.
Good fucking evening.
BRENDA:
They can't expect us to carry on
being graded unskilled.
Unskilled, my arse.
We're here to put across
our point of view about
what's going on. lt ain't fair.
And also about how it's a part
of something bigger, much bigger.
What about a little bit of support
this way?
Come on, mate.
You might learn something
if you just listened.
RlTA:
The time has come
for all women to say ''enough.''
We do not and we will not
accept this any longer.
Ow!
Dad, the pan.
Bollocks!
No, Daddy didn't mean that.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
That was magnificent.
That was wonderful.
Be back in a minute.
RlTA:
You're doing the same work
for Ford here in Liverpool
that we're doing for them
down in Dagenham.
So you know that our job is skilled.
She's a bit of all right.
RlTA:
Think beyond that.
l'm asking you to strike now
for all women, not just machinists.
Leave him alone.
He's gotta concentrate.
Go, get back.
Have a word with him.
And what is right
is that every single one of us
is entitled to the same pay as men.
WOMEN:
Yeah!
That's my girl.
Will all those in favor
please put your hands in the air now?
Yeah!
Yeah.
RlTA:
Well...
How'd you get on?
We slaughtered them.
Every single one of them
came out.
lt was incredible
though, Eddie.
Well done.
Go and check on the kids.
Give them a quick kiss good night.
RlTA:
Gonna take
some money, all right?
Oh, no. What happened?
Dad.
Tell him to give it
another go, yeah?
l'm off. See you later.
You're all right taking them
to school, aren't you?
Of course.
You're all right with that?
Everything's all right, isn't it?
Yeah, why wouldn't it be?
No reason. Have a good day.
See you later.
This is me last one.
Ey?
The shirt, l just noticed.
Oh, yeah.
Sorry, l forgot.
Forgot washing Monday.
l'll do it tonight.
Right.
Take care of your dad.
GRAHAM: Bye, Mum.
Have a good day.
Oh, dear.
Come on.
Come on, girls.
Equal pay.
Equal pay.
Equal pay.
Which way?
Wait a minute.
No, Ri, it's here.
lt's down this way.
lt must be up here.
Anyone got a map?
There.
There it is.
WOMAN 1 : Oh, my God.
WOMAN 2: Oh, here we are.
WOMAN 3: Here we go.
We want respect. We want respect.
We want respect. We want respect.
Get the banner up.
Look, get that.
There.
Equal pay for women!
MAN: l'll support you.
WOMAN: Thank you for your support.
Equal pay for women.
Women workers for equal pay.
We want respect.
MAN: Darling, over here.
WOMAN:
We want respect!
Hey!
Hello.
l finish at 4. Give us a call, love?
l never thought
we'd get this backing.
Show us what you got.
Hold on, girls!
We're not entirely unfurled, look.
MAN:
Don't we all?
l know the feeling.
Don't look, boys.
ANNOUNCER:
ln their campaign for equal pay,
women workers
of Ford Dagenham
brought their protest
to Westminster today.
Some didn't need
much persuasion
to demonstrate
their feminine charms.
lt's interesting, all this politics,
when you get down to it. Oh, sorry.
How long will they stay out?
Must be starting to bite.
As long as it takes.
Does your husband support you?
He has to.
Yeah.
Yes, of course he does.
And we all supported the men
when they went out on strike. Yeah.
Does it bother you that
you've been described as
the Revlon revolutionary?
Have they been in touch
about doing some modeling?
l don't think so.
l think you're talking to the wrong girl.
Actually...
No, l prefer to focus on
the issues of the strike.
What makes this strike different
is it's not about a specific pay...
Ain't that something, eh?
Yeah, she's doing all right.
This is Laurie Cannon,
BBC News, at Westmin--
She mentioned you
on the telly there, Ed.
l tell you what,
that's some woman
you got there.
Right. l gotta get going.
What, already?
Gotta fetch the kids.
Rita reckons they ain't
gonna be back till 6,
so l need to get them sorted.
Get your apron.
EDDlE:
Shut up, you.
Tell her to get her finger out.
lt's gone on long enough.
l don't think
they're dragging it out.
lt's all right for you,
it's different for me.
l can't be doing with this strike.
Yeah, l know that, and they'll settle it.
Soon as they can.
See you tomorrow.
Yeah. See you later, Ed.
Top it up, would you,
Pete, please?
MAN:
There's nothing l can do about it.
Come and have a look for yourself.
That's what l'm saying,
you've had them all.
There are no more finished seats.
Full stop.
Frank, what do you
want me to do?
We're going home, mate.
You what?
No more seats, no more jobs.
For any of us.
RlTA:
You lot are a bit early, aren't you?
Hey, what's going on?
You've shut the factory.
Well done.
ANNOUNCER:
Ford's Dagenham.
The plant is mainly idle.
With thousands laid off, strike bound,
and production barely ticking over,
millions of vital pounds being lost
in export orders.
And until there's
an answer to the rift
between management
and Ford's machinists,
the factory gates will remain closed
indefinitely to the entire work force.
You all right?
Yeah.
Been busy, have you?
Yeah.
lt's the final push, Eddie.
Entire main plant closed down.
Ford can't afford that, so...
l mean, l'm sorry about you
and the lads and everything.
Oh, no, don't worry
about us, Rita. We was
only saying on the way out
it's warm weather at
the moment. Cut the gas
off, we'll hardly notice.
Yeah.
Well, the thing is, Eddie,
you know, l know how you feel.
All them times
you've been on strike
and us girls come out
in support of you men.
lt's meant no work for us either.
Yeah.
Have you got something
on your mind, Eddie?
Ey?
Got something on your mind?
Got nothing on me mind.
l'm fine. l'd say.
Good.
lt ain't been
the easiest day for me either.
Thank you for waiting. l have
Mr. Ford for you gentlemen.
l thought your boy
said he could handle this.
Do we even know
what we're dealing with?
Socialist Workers Party?
Workers Revolutionary Party?
Revolutionary
Communist-fucking-Party?
Who's she with?
Well, we don't actually think
she's with anyone, sir.
We actually don't think
she's a communist. She looks--
l don't care if she looks
like Jane-fucking-Fonda.
l wanna know
why she's acting like this.
As a matter of fact,
she hasn't got a political background
either inside or outside the union.
Her husband is a moderate.
We just think she's got a beef.
A beef? Heh. Have you tried getting
a decent steak in England?
lf this woman gets what she wants,
we'll end up having to do it
right across the world.
Do you understand that?
Yes, sir, l do.
Good.
So deal with it.
Guess you'll be getting
the next flight.
Yeah.
CASTLE:
Prime Minister, l don't think
you appreciate the urgency--
The urgency of the situation.
Fetch. Good dog, Barry.
That's it.
CASTLE: Prime Minister?
Until you help me,
l cannot get this country back to work.
l understand that,
but we need to tread carefully.
Draw the unions in.
We have to acknowledge
that without the unions,
there would be no Labour Party.
Hm.
l was a member
of the trade union movement
while you were still
at your mother's breast.
Unless you've got something to add
beyond the obvious,
l'd prefer it if you keep quiet.
Harold, you asked me to do this job.
You appointed me.
You're the best man
in my cabinet,
l often say that.
Harold, l cannot do it without you.
l need you.
Jack Scamp, he's your man.
Any impasse, get Jack in.
Sits them all around a table,
beer and pork pie.
Straight-talking negotiation.
He's the way forward.
Beer and pork pie?
Mm-hm.
Might not do
for the latest one down at Ford.
A hundred and eighty-seven
machinists, all women.
Well, perhaps we can get them
a finger buffet in, eh?
Finger buffet? Good.
So how was the flight?
TOOLE Y: lt was long.
l'm sorry to drag you over.
TOOLE Y: Well, they're
taking this very seriously,
right at the top.
Come in, my wife's cooking dinner.
Well, l don't wanna be any trouble.
Honestly, it's the least l can do.
Lisa, this is Robert Tooley.
Pleasure to meet you.
Likewise.
At last.
l was telling Peter that
l'm perfectly happy to eat
later at the hotel so...
lt's really no problem.
She loves to cook, don't you?
Let me take your hat and coat.
Thank you.
Come through, have a drink.
l'll run you back when
we're finished.
Thank you. lt was delicious.
Lovely.
Thank you.
Can you bring some brandy glasses
back in with you?
Absolutely.
Lisa? Do you mind if l call you Lisa?
You must have quite a head
on your shoulders.
Peter tells me that you read
history at Cambridge?
Yes, l did.
TOOLE Y: Do you mind if l ask
what do you think of our little
problem over at the factory?
Do you think maybe
he's a bit too much velvet glove?
Not enough iron fist?
Oh, not at all, no.
No, quite the opposite actually.
Look at Vauxhall.
They don't have any problems
with the unions
because General Motors has
a more collaborative approach
to management.
Whereas at Ford, you...
Well, you only deal
with the unions
because you have to.
You tolerate them.
And as a result,
they're more entrenched
and they're aggressive
in their dealings with you.
Well, ha-ha, that's a very
progressive point of view.
Don't you think?
Cheese.
What?
We have some Stilton.
Why don't you get that out?
Right.
Some grapes.
Yes, good idea.
TOOLE Y: That'll be terrific, thank you.
Come on, girls. There's a cauliflower
or cabbage for everyone.
WOMAN 1 :
Cauliflower again?
Haven't got anything else?
Blimey, he must love you.
WOMAN 2:
l've never had real pineapple.
Let her know it's yours.
WOMAN 3: Go on, Mum.
Sandra, here's your strike pay.
Thanks.
Three quid?
Yeah, l know it's not much.
lt's all the union can afford, l'm afraid.
Better than nothing.
l'll take it back if you don't want it.
No.
Oh, all right then.
BRENDA:
Sandra, cauliflower or cabbage?
SANDRA: l'm fine, thanks.
BRENDA: Come on, take one.
No, l'm all right.
l've gotta go, actually.
So l'll see you all later.
See you.
See you later.
This one's for Connie, you seen her?
l haven't.
l'll give it to her.
Monica?
Oh, is that Connie's? l'll take it.
No, it ain't all your responsibility.
Yeah, l know.
l wanna see her anyway.
ls that real pineapple?
SANDRA: You bet.
Can l have some?
Go on, help yourself.
See you.
WOMAN: See you.
Bye.
SANDRA: Later, Rita.
Come on, girls, get stuck in.
There you go. My God.
So sweet.
SANDRA: Yeah, it's just like him.
Connie?
Connie, are you there?
Got you a present.
lt's from Brenda's fella.
Makes a change
from potatoes, eh?
Albert's been in touch.
There's a meeting
down the union.
Sounds important.
Thinks we should be there.
No, l don't think so.
What are you talking about?
Connie?
George is ill, Rita.
You know that.
He's touched.
The strike's just
whipping everything up.
l've gotta put him first.
Look, Connie, l know it's hard--
No, you don't.
l'm not his wife anymore.
l'm more like his sister or his...
But l'm his.
That's all he's got left.
Connie, l ain't saying
you gotta give up on him.
You've got a life too, you know.
You gotta live it.
Or the war's gonna end up
destroying two people.
George. George. Shh, shh.
lt's all right, it's all right,
l'm here, l'm here, l'm here.
lt doesn't matter.
l'll change it, come on.
Out you come.
What the hell do you care?
l know what you're up to.
You're gonna put me away!
George. Stop it.
Stop. Stop. Stop.
l'm sorry.
l'm sorry.
Monty, this is Mr. Tooley, he's from--
Good afternoon, Mr. Taylor.
Go break the strike, please.
As soon as possible.
l'm not sure you appreciate
whose side l'm on.
Oh, yes, l do. l've been
going through your file here.
File?
You seem to be
on your side, Mr. Taylor.
l beg your pardon?
l don't have to listen to this.
Yeah, that's it, keep walking
and in six months' time,
your union won't exist.
lndustry cannot afford to pay women
the same rates as men, gentlemen.
That is a fact.
lf it is forced to, it will collapse,
under the weight of the extra wages.
lts workers will get laid off.
Their union subscriptions
will disappear
and so will the unions
which collect them.
That means you, Monty.
You would no longer have any reason
to visit these gentlemen via the--
What is it? Berni lnn, is it?
The Queen's Head?
The Chequers? Wow,
that's a lot of restaurants.
Not to mention the all-expenses-paid
trips to the party conferences
to the union conferences.
ln Paris, no less.
The Gallic rank and file.
Good on you, Monty.
These women get what they want
and you're fucked.
l'd start thinking less about
what your union can do for you
and more about what
you can do for your union.
Go break the strike.
Please.
Personnel files,
gentlemen.
Everyone's got
a weakness, you
just have to find it.
SANDRA:
Hello?
Yeah, hello, yes. Yeah, it is.
lt's all right. l got your note.
Thank you.
Sorry, l was busy
when you came round.
What?
Really?
RlTA:
Hello, Gordon. You all right?
Yeah, l'm all right. You all right?
Yeah, l'm all right.
Yeah? Course you are.
Well, you don't have
to work, do you?
Ey?
You can afford to have principles.
l mean, you ain't the breadwinner.
lt's nice. lt's a bit extra, but you
don't have to. l have to fucking work.
Pay the electric and the food
and the coal, the fucking basics.
Only now l can't.
Fucking idiot.
MAN 1 :
Do you believe
in this women's strike?
MAN 2: No, l don't.
They shouldn't get the same as lads.
MAN 1 :
You don't believe in equal pay?
No, no, no. Not for women.
MAN 3:
The men are the breadwinners.
The women shouldn't strike
because a lot of them husbands
work here.
Now that the lads have been made
redundant, they're gonna be nervous.
And Monty, Ford has
rattled him, l can tell.
So be careful what news
you share with him, all right?
That's our fridge.
Bingo.
Excuse me.
What's going on?
EDDlE:
We ain't paid the HP.
Last of mine went in the electric bill.
How are you set?
You want me to hold
the door open for you?
Go on. l'll make life
a little bit easier for you.
You spent the money.
Ey?
Spent the last
of the emergency,
out of the repair kit.
l had to pay the milkman. Not that
it matters, we ain't got a fridge.
Why?
What do you mean, why?
Could have put him off till next week.
He wanted paying.
Should've told him we didn't have it.
Right.
l'm in charge of the money.
Ain't much fucking
good at it, are you?
We might have some left.
Welcome to the real world, Rita.
This is being on strike.
You run out of cash and you
end up screaming at each other.
What happened to you?
Oh, shut up.
Don't you tell me ''shut up.'' Eddie--
Hi, Rita.
All right, Marge?
l thought you were back at work.
SHARON: Can you come in now?
ln a minute.
No, no, we're still on strike.
Oh, right.
Sharon.
l was sure
l saw your Sandra
down the factory.
Sandra?
Yeah, it was her.
Love, in a minute.
l'll see you later, all right?
All right.
l'm sorry, love.
Mummy's gotta
sort something.
But you said--
Yeah, l know l did.
Eddie? Eddie,
can you look after Sharon?
l'll be back later, love.
lt's all right, sweetheart.
Yes. l like this.
This is beautiful. Hi. Sally, is it?
Sandra.
Sandra, yes.
Okay, chin up for me.
Find this light up here.
Find the birdie. There we go.
That's a little bit sexy.
Okay, there we go.
Fabulous, you're a natural.
Let's go down on the floor, here.
l like that. l like that.
And l fucking well like that.
l don't know about you guys,
l've forgotten about the car.
That's great. Let's go up here.
Let's go nice and high now, guys.
Straight into the camera.
Sandra.
Keep that. Just keep
the pose going there, Sandra.
SANDRA:
l'm sorry, can l just take a minute?
Do you wanna get--?
l need a minute.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Sure.
This is something l've always wanted.
l know.
l mean, l don't even know
if l really care about equal pay.
l mean, it's still a shitty factory.
This is just a brochure,
but, you know...
lt's only trade, but it'll lead on.
Get my foot in the door,
you know?
l just don't wanna let you down.
You haven't let us down.
You haven't gone back to work,
have you?
Because that's
the deal here, isn't it?
They set up this shoot,
you go back to work?
Only you haven't gone back
to work, have you? So...
But if they don't use these photos--
Sandra.
Look at you.
You are a model.
You're a natural.
They couldn't get better.
You could, though.
There she is.
Up against the clock now,
my love.
Come along. Drape yourself across
this vehicle. l shall avert my eyes.
SANDRA:
How's this look?
No?
BO Y:
Hi, Mum.
Mum, we've gotta go.
Yes. Sorry, darling.
You're going, are you?
You know l am. l said.
Rita asked me to go special.
You gotta fight for
what you believe in.
You know that more than anyone.
You think l'd do the same again?
lf another war come round?
l know you would.
l love you.
Go.
Minister, the unions
are turning.
The other unions.
Normally, they all band together.
Yes, l gather
that's called solidarity.
They're not being solid.
The men want to
return to work.
So they're telling unions
to withdraw support,
put pressure on the women.
They'll be back within the week.
We'll see.
You're assuming the girls will
do as they're told.
lt's not my fault.
RlTA: Connie.
You said it was important.
Thanks.
Listen, l'm sorry l'm late.
We've got to talk
before this meeting.
WOMAN: They're ready for you now.
This way, ladies.
They've hung you out to dry.
Lads in the other unions
have had enough.
So whatever they say to you now,
don't believe it.
We'll sort it out later, all right?
We're absolutely behind you still,
Rita. You and the girls.
We're not saying otherwise.
We've got other
representatives from other
unions to pledge their support.
You haven't got them
all though, have you?
The important ones.
No, but we're very confident
we'll prevail.
The thing is though,
we've got the national
conference coming up.
The most sensible thing,
probably, would be
just go to a vote.
Which would be the actual
final and binding position,
l believe, comrade.
After which, it'd be out of our hands.
That's right, Monty.
As l say,
we're expecting full support.
RlTA:
We gotta get down
to Eastbourne and talk to them first.
CONNlE:
''Actual final and binding position,
comrade.'' Cheeky sod.
That Monty is a sly one
though, isn't he?
l can't wait to see his face
when we turn up down there.
See you tomorrow.
We can deal with him, Con.
We can deal with anyone.
That's right, comrade.
CONNlE:
No! No, George!
No!
Connie! Connie!
Connie.
CONNlE: George!
Connie! Connie, let me in!
lt's okay. Dear God.
May the blessing of God Almighty,
the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit
be with you always. Amen.
Amen.
l'm so sorry, Connie.
No, you're not.
What?
You thought he was
a millstone. You thought
he was keeping me back.
Hey, Con, that's enough.
l should've been there.
l'm all right.
lt's all right.
l know.
Hello.
Hello.
This is a surprise.
Yes, l'm sorry. l'm sorry it's so late.
l nearly didn't come at all.
lt's all right.
l...
Sorry, yeah.
Do you want a cup of tea?
To be honest,
l'm not feeling chatty today.
l'm sorry.
No, it's fine, really.
l really don't want
to keep you. lt's just, um...
Mr. Clarke's been asked
to leave the school.
We won.
They're getting rid of him.
Right. Of course, yeah.
Oh, that's great.
l just--
That's brilliant.
Well, l wanted to tell you.
Well, cheers. Thanks.
Anyway, l'm sorry to bother you.
Not at all, thanks.
l'm married to
Peter Hopkins.
Sorry, what?
At the factory.
l had a feeling that you
didn't know. And l didn't
know who you were.
With the strike.
Sorry, l don't understand.
l'm sorry, if you've come here
to tell me to back off,
l wasn't joking.
l've had a hell of a day and--
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Keep going. Please, keep going.
Do you know who l am?
Who l actually am?
No.
l'm Lisa Burnett, l'm 31 years old.
l have
a first-class honors degree
from one of the finest universities
in the world.
And my husband treats me
like l'm a fool.
And when l was studying
for my degree,
l was very, very happy.
And mostly because of the work.
Because l loved reading
about all these extraordinary people
making history.
And...
And l just wondered what it felt like.
So let me know, will you,
when you finish doing it?
l don't know.
Don't give up.
Don't let me down.
Rita, wait! Where are you going?
Eastbourne. l left you a note.
l thought you changed your mind.
RlTA: l gotta go.
Rita? Look, Rita, just stop.
What, Eddie?
Just listen to me. Just...
We've gotta sort this out.
Eddie--
No, no, no, we have, right? Just...
Look, l know it ain't been
good between us lately,
which l ain't about
to make worse.
Eddie--
Just listen to me.
Look, if l ain't appreciated
what you've done recently--
Gotta catch a bus.
l really am sorry,
but you ain't been
perfect either.
This really ain't the time, Eddie.
Yes, it is, because it needs saying.
l know you reckon l ain't bothered
about the important things.
And l drift along and l'm more
interested in fiddling with motorbikes
or making tents out of seat covers,
but, you know, l try me best.
You know? l have a go.
l like a drink, but l ain't out
on the beer every night
or screwing other women or...
And l've never once
raised me hand.
Ever. Or the kids.
Christ.
What?
Why you looking like that?
Right. You're a saint now, is that
what you're telling me, Eddie?
You're a bleeding saint?
Because you give us an even break?
What are you saying?
That is as it should be. Jesus, Eddie.
What do you think
this strike's all been about?
Actually you're right.
You don't go on the drink.
Don't gamble, you join in
with the kids, you don't
knock us about. Lucky me.
For Christ's sake, Eddie,
that's as it should be!
You try and understand that.
Rights, it's not privileges.
lt's that easy. lt really bloody is.
Didn't think you were coming.
Hey.
MAN:
Very good, gentlemen.
Can l call on Monty Taylor,
Senior Convener, Ford Dagenham?
Thank you, l shall try to be brief.
lf you would.
The great achievements
of civilization
depended on slow progress.
Step by step.
Hence, l am here because l feel
that my union, in backing
these lovely, brave ladies,
these Boadiceas in hairnets,
on their way to a fight for equal pay,
no matter what.
But we have to think about
the trade union struggle as a whole.
Therefore, gentlemen, l ask you
to consider these ladies' demands
too much, too soon.
Monty Taylor, you two-faced,
hypocritical toe-rag!
You fucking piece of--
Hang on.
No, you hang on!
Sorry, gentlemen.
Hey, we'll sort this out
between ourselves later, eh?
Monty, l've seen more of
their mugs on the front pages
the past few weeks
than you've managed
in 20 years.
l wouldn't mind hearing from them.
Go on. Go on.
My best friend
lost her husband recently.
He was--
He was a gunner in
the 50 Squadron in the RAF.
Got shot down one time
on a raid to Essen.
And even though
he was badly injured,
he managed to bail out.
l asked him why he joined the RAF
and he said:
''Well, they got the best women,
haven't they?''
Which they did.
And then he said, ''Well, you gotta
do something, haven't you?''
You had to do something.
That was a given.
Because it was a matter of principle.
You had to stand up,
you had to do what was right.
Otherwise you wouldn't be able
to look at yourself in the mirror.
When did that change, eh?
When did we, in this country,
decide to stop fighting?
l don't think we ever did.
But you've gotta back us up.
You've gotta stand up with us.
We are the working classes.
The men and the women.
We're not separated by sex.
But only by those who are
willing to accept injustice
and those,
like our friend George,
who are prepared to go into battle
for what is right.
And equal pay for women is right.
Thank you.
BRENDA:
l never knew you could
talk like that.
Scorch marks all the way
up the curtains where
Monty's arse caught fire.
Hello. Excuse me.
Gin.
SANDRA:
l need to calm my nerves.
They might vote against us.
WOMAN: How long we gotta wait?
SANDRA: They said half an hour.
You know what we can do?
Stick it on Monty.
BRENDA: Brilliant.
WOMAN: You're a genius.
SANDRA:
ln that case, l'll have a double.
WOMAN:
Babycham.
BRENDA: Double gin.
RlTA: Eddie.
Excuse me.
WOMAN: What do you want, Rita?
Where's she gone?
Most probably needs some air.
Can we have Babycham?
l've come to say sorry.
l mean, l thought about
what you said and
you were right,
l suppose.
You are right.
And it's amazing
what you've done,
Rita O'Grady.
And l wanna back you.
See, l was gonna tell you that.
Only then when l come in
and you were speaking
and l heard you up there,
and you was huge.
You was...
l don't know.
Like a force.
Then l thought
l'm not sure me
backing you makes that
much difference, to be honest.
Where you are now.
Anyway, go on,
you go back to your meeting.
l'm gonna...
l should...
Eddie?
You've said
some pretty stupid things
in your time.
Of course you backing me
makes a difference.
lt makes all the difference
in the world.
Very good, gentlemen.
The results of the vote
are as follows:
Delegates in favor of support
for the women machinists:
Seventy-nine.
Delegates against:
Forty-eight.
l declare the motion carried in favor
of the Dagenham machinists.
Their bloody unions
are back in line.
lt's verbatim. Our man was there.
Well, well, well.
lt really does seem time
to call in Sir Jack.
Good. l'll do that, then.
l'll set up a court of inquiry
which he can oversee
and let's hope
that does the trick.
Oh, yes. One more thing.
Set up a meeting, will you?
Minister?
With the machinists.
Their leaders.
Pardon me?
l want to meet them.
At the earliest opportunity.
But--
Yes?
The minister doesn't do that--
Never has done.
lt'll just encourage them.
Give credence to their cause.
l am what is known
as a fiery redhead.
Now, l hate to make this
a matter of appearance
and go all womanly on you,
but there you have it.
And me standing up
like this is, in fact,
just that redheaded fieriness
leaping to the fore.
Credence? l will give
credence to their cause?
My God, their cause
already has credence!
lt is equal pay.
Equal pay is common justice
and if you two
weren't such a pair of
egotistical, chauvinistic,
bigoted dunderheads,
you would realize that.
Oh, my office is run
by incompetents.
And l am sick of being
patronized, spoken down to
and generally treated
as if l was the May queen.
Set up the meeting!
ALBERT: Morning, Ed.
All right, Albert?
Yeah.
Now, listen. Listen to me.
Now, there's no reason
to panic, Rita.
Okay.
Only, l've had a call
from Barbara Castle's office.
RlTA:
Oh, my God.
Eddie.
What's happened now?
Barbara Castle
wants to talk to me.
Well done.
Cheers.
The secretary of state
is seeing the women?
On whose authority?
On her own, apparently. l gather
Mrs. Castle is quite a forceful woman.
ls she?
What are you doing?
l represent Ford.
We are the biggest
car manufacturer in the world.
We pump millions of pounds
into the U.K. economy.
l think it's time
my bosses reminded
one or two people of that fact.
Have you or have you not invited
the Ford women to your offices?
Prime Minister--
l've just spent the last half-hour
on the phone to Ford,
reassuring him
that my government
isn't on the side of the strikers.
lt isn't taking sides.
We have to grasp the nettle.
Now is not the time.
Ten years ago,
you were adamant.
l wasn't running the country then.
See the women
if that's what
you want to do.
But whatever you do,
do not upset Ford.
l've got enough trouble
with the Americans as it is.
lt's all right.
lt's your missus l'm after.
ls she in?
Rita? What are you doing here?
Rita?
l need a favor.
Come in.
Thanks.
Lisa?
What?
Come inside.
Everything all right?
Want a cup of tea?
RlTA:
Yeah.
MAN 1 :
Rita. Smile, please.
MAN 2:
Over here, ladies.
Excuse me, gotta get through.
MAN 2:
Do you think the strike will go on?
How long?
Rita.
Wait a minute.
Hey, Connie.
Sorry l'm late.
You made it.
What if Mrs. Castle says ''no deal''?
How will you cope?
Cope? How will we cope?
We're women. Now,
don't ask such stupid questions.
Ladies, ladies.
Come up. This way, please.
RlTA:
Come on, this is it.
All right. See you later.
MAN 3:
Stay back, please, gentlemen.
Follow me.
Mr. Tooley.
Madam Secretary.
l wasn't expecting you.
But you are meeting with the women.
l think it is time
l heard their argument, yes.
But if you would care
to wait, l will inform you
of any decisions we make.
l think we both
want the same thing,
Mrs. Castle, you and l.
l think we wanna
see Ford Motors
employing British workers.
Ford is a vital
part of our economy.
l am well aware of that.
Then don't make us
build our cars elsewhere.
Help us hold the line here.
Support our efforts
to combat these
constant strikes
which undermine our ability
to build cars at a profit,
which is why we're
in business in the first place.
Otherwise, we will take
our factories elsewhere.
Are you threatening me,
Mr. Tooley?
l'm trying to stop
40,000 people from
losing their jobs, Mrs. Castle.
That's how many workers
Ford employs.
Not to mention tens
of thousands of peripheral
jobs sacrificed.
Now, l don't think that
either one of us wants
to take that risk, surely.
Look, look. Eileen and Monica.
l wonder if they can see us.
Get me the prime minister.
Yes. Put me through
to Number 1 0.
Yes. Yes. Fine. Thank you.
l'm afraid he's on a plane.
Won't land until this evening.
Thanks for coming.
Connie, l'm so sorry.
No, don't.
lt's me who needs to apologize.
Don't be silly.
The minister will see you now.
Here we go.
You all right?
Ready?
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Mrs. O'Grady,
l recognize you
from the news.
Rita, please.
Rita.
Very pleased to meet you.
Well, and me, you.
Sorry. This is Connie.
Connie.
How do you do?
RlTA: Brenda.
How do you do?
Sandra.
Well, l'm delighted you could
all come. Please, take a seat.
CASTLE:
Would you care for a sherry?
Be lovely, thank you.
Thank you.
You haven't got any
whiskey, have you?
Here's a woman after my own heart.
Make that two.
Thank you.
Well, cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Now, l've been following
your dispute very closely
and l want to say how proud l am
of the battle that you fought.
l fully support the struggle
for equal pay and you will have it.
But in time.
What?
lndustry'll object,
the lords will kick up a fuss,
the press will have a field day.
lt's not going to be easy.
Well, what is
what's worth fighting for?
Return to work.
Go back to your machines
and you have my word
l will push forward with your fight.
No.
Mrs. O'Grady--
No, we need something solid.
Something now.
You've got the authority.
You know, we thought
seeing you, we'd...
ln politics, you sometimes
have to play the long game--
We ain't politicians,
we're working women.
And so are you.
Very well.
What would it take
to get you back?
Excuse me?
The ''something solid.''
And mark well, l say something,
not everything.
Well, we'd need...
We'd need a guarantee
that we're gonna get equal pay.
And in the meantime,
we need to move much closer
to the male rate. Now. At Ford.
Seventy-five percent?
Ninety.
Ninety.
At least.
You're putting me
in a very difficult position.
l wasn't too aggressive,
was l?
No.
Mr. Tooley, that risk
you were talking about?
l'm going to have to take it.
And from Whitehall we're getting
news that talks between Mrs. Castle
and the striking Ford machinists
are nearing a conclusion.
And a statement is expected
in the next few minutes.
lntense interest here...
Just a moment please, minister.
Yes, of course.
That's Biba, isn't it?
l saw that in a magazine.
Yeah. l have to give it back
at the end of the day.
ls that C&A?
Yes.
Why pay more? That's what l say.
Well, exactly.
l've got the same one at home.
Have you really?
MAN 1 :
They're ready for you now, minister.
Girls?
Rita? Rita?
Ladies.
No, after you.
Oh, no, no.
After you.
Oh, gosh.
Come on, then. Thank you.
MAN 2:
Rita, is it a positive result?
Now, ladies, can l help?
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you very much.
l am delighted to announce
that following our talks this afternoon,
the 1 8 7 Ford machinists
will be going back to work
on the first of July.
They will receive an immediate
pay rise of 7 pence an hour.
Which will put them
at 92 percent of the male rate.
However-- However, this is not all.
As a result of our discussion,
l can confirm
that the government is in full support
of the creation of an Equal Pay Act.
And by the autumn of this year,
l guarantee appropriate legislation
to ensure that
that act becomes law. Thank you.
Yeah!
More support from the back there.
''YOU CAN GET lT lF
YOU REALLY WANT''
To celebrate, they let us have
the canteen, and we had a party.
l don't remember much of that.
No, l remember you didn't, no.
And l thought to myself,
there is some of the old spirit
that gave us the success
of the suffragettes.
WOMAN: We are on strike.
MAN: All of you?
All of us. All us machinists, anyway.
MAN: So no car seat covers for Fords?
No, not from us, anyway.
You're still staying out?
Yeah.
You're not going back at all?
No.
Nobody expected us to come out
on strike. Nobody.
What we're fighting for,
we'll stay there until we get it.
Women don't make a habit
of coming out on strike for nothing.
Well, we didn't think we were
that strong.
We didn't think
we would bring Fords
to a standstill.
lt was all down to us. Us ladies.
And we are ladies,
whatever anybody else may say.
We are ladies.
RlTA:
Everybody out!
