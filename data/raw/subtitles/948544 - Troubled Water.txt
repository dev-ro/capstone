And so Kai from F
was released this Thursday.
Let us light him a candle.
A candle to inspire good
thoughts and the hope that
he will manage on the outside.
Light a candle for what you
carry inside of you.
I found this.
- Substitute organist?
- With my own flat and all.
- Do you think I can handle it?
- Of course you can handle it.
I've served 2/3 and behaved well.
It's with my own flat and all.
Can you help me? I don't know
how I'll... what I'll do.
Congratulations.
- On your release and...
- Thank you.
And the job, if you get it.
- Any plans for tomorrow?
- No.
I thought I'd go out
and get something to eat.
Good luck!
Do something, damn it!
I've written you a certificate.
It doesn't say you've done time.
Only that you've played here.
- What if they check?
- All we can tell you is to be honest.
Someone might remember you
from the newspapers.
I think you should use
your middle name instead.
Thomas.
Hi.
I'm Thomas Hansen.
I'm here for the job interview
as substitute organist.
- Liss from the congregation.
- I have to be a bit careful.
I'm afraid our decision is final.
We need someone with more 
experience. Thanks for applying.
Sorry for not informing you.
Hey, can I have a look at the organ?
Thank you.
- Did you play recently?
- Yes. I'm sorry.
Thomas.
I better greet you properly.
Anna. I'm a priest here.
- You've played in the Ila jail?
- Yes.
For the Sunday evening services.
- Where else have you played?
- And you can start immediately?
It's messy here this month, so
we need someone who actually can play.
- How is your hand?
- You heard him. You did.
Here. Take any notes you need.
There is an entrance there,
but let's take this way and then up.
You can't bring anything
or you risk damaging the pipes.
The altar-piece is younger
than the church. From 1892.
And up here is our organ.
Beautiful.
Hi. It went great. I got the job.
Have you eaten? Is it done?
Oh.
I don't know. I'll try to
eat something in a little while.
Yes, of course. I understand that.
I'll call you later if I need
to know anything else.
You're not an organist.
The last guy played differently.
You can't be here.
Get down from there.
Oh, here you are? Aren't you 
supposed to be at the children's club?
He didn't bother you, did he?
Were you able to practice?
It's fine.
Excuse me. I was practising
when I heard a noise.
- I'm just trying to open the window.
- All right.
I'll...
No!
- Why did you that?
- What?
I'm trying to open the window
to let it out.
I didn't realize.
My apologies.
Now you don't have to open it.
Can you help me?
Please, please.
- Where do you want it?
- Here.
You're doing fine. Come on.
- Where should I...
- Just inject it there.
- But I don't see it. Where?
- Here, look.
You're doing fine.
Is anybody here not baptized?
And you others? 
Do you remember your baptism?
Why are we baptized?
What do you know. Usually
we pour the water on the child's head.
If you drink it, 
it will act a lot faster.
So - water gives life.
Thomas?
This is our new organist.
Couldn't you play us something?
Show them good some church music.
I apologize. This is unacceptable.
It's fine. I can scrub it off.
Out of the question. You're not
moving in until everything's proper.
You need a paint job 
and some new furniture.
I'll paint it myself so I can
choose everything. It's great.
- Is that included?
- What do you know. Yes, I suppose.
- But this is...
- This will do perfectly.
It's a great place for me.
I need your personal particulars
in order to give you your salary.
Here.
Just fill this out.
And please...
Write clearly.
And your social security number.
Thank you.
- Here you are. Have a nice day.
- Good bye.
I play here.
Thomas Hansen.
- What are you doing here?
- I live here.
What did you want?
I promised to drop off some curtains.
They insisted you need some color.
What do you think?
Here?
Where are you from? Stavanger?
No. I'm from various places.
Mostly from here.
Do you have a family?
I don't want to talk about it.
I grew up with my mother and
she died at the time
when you don't care that
much about your parents.
Which one do you like most?
Many people feel bad about that.
If you ever need to talk to anyone...
Not much helps 
when somebody has died.
Sorry for asking so much.
It's an occupational injury.
Oh, you don't have any curtain rods.
I didn't think about that.
- Should I keep them?
- Yes, keep them.
Can I come in and play?
No.
Stop it...
Thomas, your particulars didn't
match the ones in the registry.
But they matched a certain
Jan Thomas Hansen.
That was my bad.
I never use "Jan".
That's why I asked you
to write clearly.
Yes, I'm sorry about that.
I haven't done this before,
so you'll have to try it first.
People always want psalms
for their wedding ceremonies.
- But you make them more beautiful.
- Thank you.
Do you know the story about
Jesus walking on the water?
Yes. I don't like it.
He who believes will float.
He who doubts will sink.
It's about daring 
to believe in the miracle.
A few days ago we had no organist.
But now when I arrived
an old lady was weeping
from your beautiful music.
Well, thanks for today.
- Careful.
- My brakes hardly work.
You shouldn't ride with bad brakes.
As a priest you really shouldn't
neglect your bicycle.
I have my hands full with
taking care of the people.
Usually I'm in full control.
And everything is part of
God's plan.
So when you can't find an 
explanation it's part of God's plan?
If it's all part of God's plan...
...why is there so much evil?
- Is that part of His plan too?
- Yes.
Many come to me to share
their experiences with evil.
And many can move on 
thanks to those experiences.
Do you ever forgive on behalf 
of God, but condemn personally?
I'm not sure forgiveness
is that important.
Many people never forgive anything,
but God forgives everything.
- So what is important?
- Reconciliation.
To be able to accept 
things the way they are.
- Hi.
- Hi, mom.
- He wanted to sleep here.
- That's alright. Thank you so much.
Now go and lie down.
Lie down, I said!
Huh?
Do you like in that yellow house?
No.
- What do we do now?
- What do you mean?
Just look at him!
Do something then!
- How's it going?
- Fine.
I have to drop him off and do
some shopping before work.
- Do you want to sit at the back?
- Yes.
Take me over there.
And spin around.
Are you okay?
There was a crazy lady that
came over and talked to me.
It was just a bit unsettling.
- Do you remember the Holy Communion?
- Yes, of course.
The mass of Thomas.
The mass for those who doubt.
Have you every had Communion?
No. I don't believe in it,
so why should I do it?
You don't have to believe. Communion
is flesh and blood, bread and whine.
It works no matter what.
Why didn't you mention it earlier?
I'll tell them you can't come.
At normal workplaces you go
home when your child is ill.
Where is the babysitter
you're trying to contact?
Where is the babysitter
you're trying to contact?
Here's some chocolate milk.
Jens?
- Tickle me like you did before.
- Watch out.
Stop it. Stop.
- I'm not that ill.
- You told your mother you were.
Are you okay?
Stop it.
Jens, let me see. Let me see...
Stop it!
Let me see. Let me see.
I'll just go and open.
I got pregnant as a student.
His father wanted me
to have an abortion.
So I had to make a choice.
- Jens or the father?
- Jens or everything.
My family thought I
had made the wrong decision.
If we had had another bishop
I wouldn't have become a priest.
But Jens' father knows about him.
Doesn't he?
I've often prayed for good things
to come out of Jens' fatherlessness.
Isn't it naïve to believe that
good things will come from bad things?
I am naïve.
That's why I'm a priest.
I believe in a god whose
existence can't be proven.
But I know that it works.
So you're never in doubt?
I'm in doubt about a middleground.
It's either one way or the other.
- Thanks for your help.
- I had a good time.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
- Are you the churchwarden today?
- Yes.
Thomas...
There was a lady here 
who wanted to talk to you.
Do you have anything 
for which you need to be forgiven?
Was that why she came here?
Who was it?
- The mother?
- Yes.
What should I do? Say I'm sorry?
Yes. Give her a chance to forgive
you so she'll be able to move on.
That's a good suggestion.
Let's leave it at that.
Listen to me.
It wasn't my fault. I don't
need forgiveness for anything.
Well?
What do you want from us?
Is your wife here?
I think she tried to contact me.
I want to you tell her everything. 
Then confess it all.
Tell her what really happened.
That you would have taken Isak 
away no matter what she'd have done.
And that you drowned him.
It was an accident.
I'm sorry but I don't...
That's wrong.
That's the wrong answer.
You come to my house and
keep denying everything.
I have served a sentence as though
I had murdered him. Now I want to...
...try and create a normal life.
You're not even...
You're not even trying to 
admit to what you did.
She's the one who tried
to contact me.
Why do you think she did?
Why do you think she did?
You...
In court all you did
was blame each other.
She needs a confession from you.
That's all we need from you.
An apology at the very least.
Leave us and go straight to hell.
Don't you think people notice?
You'll never be a normal person.
You fucking bastard!
In the same way he also took the cup after the supper
gave thanks, and gave it to them and said
"Take, and drink of it, all of you."
This is the Body of Christ.
This is the Body of Christ.
This is the Body of Christ.
This is the Body of Christ.
This is the Body of Christ.
This is the Body of Christ.
This is the Blood of Christ.
The crucified
and ressurected Jesus Christ
has now given us
His holy Body and Blood
which He gave to expaite
us from our sins.
He gives us the courage to live
and the courage to believe.
Peace be with you.
Sometimes Jens reminds me more of 
what I don't have than what I have.
According to them, I haven't
done anything right.
Life never turns out 
the way you expect it to.
It sure doesn't.
I remember...
...when I was younger.
A boy in our 
neighborhood disappeared.
The mother had taken 
him out with his pram
and left him outside of a café.
She had gone in...
...and when she came out...
...he wasn't there...
...anymore.
It turned out there were
two older boys who had...
...taken him away to play with him.
But I remember that.
Those two boys.
It was very gruesome.
They murdered him.
Jens reminds of that boy.
And all that happened.
I need you.
Jens likes you so much.
I just don't want to
involve Jens in anything that...
I just need to know what you think.
I think you're amazing.
I think Jens is amazing.
He was so happy 
to hear that you're coming.
Jens, look who came to pick you up.
Hi!
His bag is inside.
- Good bye, Jens.
I forgot a drawing that
I was going to give to mom.
- Is it inside the daycare centre?
- Yes.
- Can't you get it tomorrow?
- No, I have to do it now.
- Come on.
- I want to stay and watch the bike.
Hold on to that.
And watch your bag too.
There are names on the underside.
Here it is.
Thank you. Good bye.
Jens?
Have you seen the boy
that sat on the bicycle?
Jens!
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling his mother.
Wait before you do that.
Wait before you do that. Please.
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for a little boy.
Did somebody move him?
Yes, Isak, he was...
He was in his pram.
Isak?
Isak!
Isak!
- He can't have gone far.
- But was somebody here?
Has anybody seen...
There was a pram there. -Isak!
I can't find my son.
I just went into the café.
I was going to buy some chocolate.
Isak!
One, two, three!
- Surprise!
- Yes, really! But why?
- He hasn't told yet.
- I got a job. In Denmark.
- In Denmark?
- Look what I've found.
Look at the house we can rent.
It's hardly an hour from your
parents. What do you think?
Yes, but...
It's only for two years.
We'll rent this place out.
Show of hands. Who wants to move?
Do we have to move?
Selma... honey...
Daddy just wanted
to surprise us.
Come on then.
There...
