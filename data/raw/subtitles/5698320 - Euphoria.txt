<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">It is so good to see you.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I - I was afraid you'd cancel.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello. We have a reservation for a double room.
- Your name?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- Emilie Thompson.
- Ines Thompson.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- So... Let me know if there's anything you need.
- Thank you.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- What a place.
- I wanted to treat us.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">It's huge.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. It's so nice to get out of New York.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I read some reviews this morning
about your new exhibition.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">That's fine...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I thought they were mean.
I'm sure you worked very hard.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">They used to love you.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">That's how it goes.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">People don't like my work, but
at least they feel something.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">It's very fancy.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I got more than I was expecting for my flat.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- You've sold your apartment?
- Yeah. I moved out last week.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">If I'm gonna go back to my studies,
a student room will be just fine.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Ladies, may I take your order?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Umm...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I'll have the Lobster and champagne.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">The same.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I found this.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Look!</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- What's this?
- Mum's ring.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I found this when I went through my stuff,
I thought you might want it?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">No, keep it.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">[piano playing in background]</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Cheers.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so glad you came.
Grateful, that you took the time.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- Excuse me?
- Yes?  - Please...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Would one of you beautiful ladies
care to dance?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- No.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- Why not.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Emilie.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">So... Tell me about yourself, Emilie.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">What is there to say?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I'm nobody. Alone, unimportant.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Full of unfulfilled dreams.
[Emilie laughing]</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, I'm here on holiday with my sister.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Now, when her career isn't going
so well, she finally agrees to see me.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have time to lie.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">And why is that?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Just dance with me please...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">[piano music stops]</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">You've got sensitive hands.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I'd love to go to bed with you, but...
- (emilie sighs)</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think that's possible I'm afraid.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Good night.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- Emilie?
- What happened to you? Is everything fine?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">What happens? What...
Get the fuck...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I probably shouldn't have
 drunk champagne.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">There's just been a lot going
on in my head.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I just need to relax.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">This place we're going
to will be so nice.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">So calm.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">So peaceful.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">It'll be perfect.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Just perfect.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- Look!
- Oh!</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">That's so gorgeous!</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- c'mon
- no. nope. Emilie?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- Tell me! Tell me!</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Where are we going?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">We are going to the most beautiful
place in the world.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you already said that. C'mon.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">It's, it's... very special.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">The question is, can I have a
massage there?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- Of course, madame. As many as you wish
- Oh! Good!</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Then I am happy.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?, Hi!
(laughs)</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, can you hear me?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I umm...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I saw the, the press photo
you're using and...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">That's what you chose.
(on phone)</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I want you to use the other one.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">The one where I'm not smiling.
(Ines sighs)</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">We're leaving the country.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I thought I told you?
Don't worry. It's not far now.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">This is it.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Shouldn't they have a
sign-post or something?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">They probably want to keep it
as anonymous as possible.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">(Ines laughs)
Well they've definitely succeeded with that.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- You must be Emilie.
- Yes.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">And you must be her sister?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- And you are?
- I'm Marina. I'm Emilie's personal companion.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so glad you made it. Most of our
guests prefer the helicopter option.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">It's a bit of a walk, but if you
get tired, we'll help you.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Are we going through here?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">It's not so far.
You'll manage.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Here we are.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- Is it like you imagined?
- Even better.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">This is where most of the guests
love to come when they're alone.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Or with their
partners or friends.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Just sit here, play
chess, be quiet.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">You have to sign in first.
Reception is through there.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Let me know if there is
anything you need.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Hello? Hi! Welcome.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Please, come in.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Hi. Aaron.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- And you must be Emilie.
-Yes.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Please, sit down.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">(Aaron sighs) </font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">So, first things first.
Passports please.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Here you go.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">We have a medical certificate, lawyer's
documents, and proof of payment.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">So everything seems to be
in order. Thank you.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure you know how
everything works here -</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- but I'm legally required to run it
all through with you -</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">in person, before we can continue.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Unlike other organizations, we offer our guests
a service created for, and by the individual.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Freedom of choice is our utmost concern,
and serving that choice is our aim.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">There are a selection of activities you can chose
 from - you'll find a schedule by the front entrance.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">We try to accommodate our guests'
unique desires and wishes -</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- in order to make their final days as fulfilling
 and comforting as possible.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Emilie. Should you choose to continue -</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- your leaving will take place
in six days from now.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Each leaving, is preceded by a bell.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">The individual is taken to the leaving cabin and
is offered a drink containing a strong sedative -</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS"> - that will put them to sleep.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">The choice to drink is left
entirely to the individual.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">A week later, the body will be transported
to the address you have provided..</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Photographs are not permitted.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have any questions?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Where are my bags?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't know.
- well can you go and get somebody to get my bags.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Try to calm down. I'm not well.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Your bags are already
in your room.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- I will take you there.
- What are you doing?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- It's ok
- what the...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you fucking touch me!</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">You do not have to do anything.
You just have to stay with me.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean you're not well?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna have a shower. We can
talk when you have calmed down.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not going to calm down! I want you to
tell me what is going on!</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I just want a bath!</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I was diagnosed three years ago.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I had chemo, but it didn't work.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">It's everywhere.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have long left.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't you tell me?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't want to scare you.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't want to give you
a reason not to come.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I had the right to know.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I dont 'think so.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I tried.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I tried to call.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">But you didn't pick up.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I waited, but you
never called back.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">A while later you emailed
saying that you were busy.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">And then...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I do not know.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Time went by and...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I lost the words.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">And this place?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">This is how I want to leave.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Emilie?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Sugar Puffs?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. We always had them when we
were little. Don't you remember?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Mum's Blueberry Pancakes.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I sent them the recipe.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Perfect.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry if you feel like I
do not respect you -</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- but I really think that
we should get out of here.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">You need proper care.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">If you leave, I'll still do it.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Have some pancakes. They're good.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">jezuz...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Good morning.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">And breakfast was wonderful.
Everything, just as I wanted.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm glad to hear that!</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">And Ines, how are you today?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Fine.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- Well I thought that...
- Excuse me, umm...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing with these people?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- We're helping them.
- Really?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">We can't save their lives, but
these last days are important.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">So people can leave in the
right way for them.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">This is a free zone.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Without the world to judge.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">So Emilie, what would you like to do today?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I was hoping the three of
us could sit and talk.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- Follow me.
- Emilie...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">No music, thank you.
(Marina speaking softly) </font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">So... Emilie?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">There's some I wanted to talk about, umm...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I wrote them down.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I have never been able
to control my feelings.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Everything has always flooded
straight into me.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">My sister, on the other hand -</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- has always been very clear.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">She can turn her emotions on and off
feeling exactly what she wants to feel -</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">-  when she wants to feel it.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">It all began when dad left
with another woman.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I was nine, my sister was seven.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Mum, never got over it.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I stayed by her side. I tried to stop her
 from slipping through the gaps.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- but there was no way...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Five years ago she hung
herself in the woods.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Just stop it.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">What could she possibly say about that?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">You told me yesterday that you were dying,
and now you want me to sit here in this place -</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- in front of this woman and talk about
our childhood. Is that what you want?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">You never wanted to talk about it.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I don't need to listen to this.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">This is not going to happen.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Those charming bells of death.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I do not think that is allowed.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">It's personal. For inspiration.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">So you're above the rules, are you?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Art's above the rules.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I don't dislike rules.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">It's just that I have never found any
sufficiently worthwhile to follow.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- I understand everything.
- hmm..</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">But I have yet to find the
meaning in anything.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Can I take a photo of you?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">It's alright.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I have a stage three
terminal brain tumour.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- What about you? You do not look sick.
- I'm here with my sister.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Is she artistic too?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">It's just me.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">It keeps me together.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand this place.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">People tend to think that there's
 some kind of meaning.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Something they should be able to understand before they die.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">There is nothing to understand.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">You just die.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">They refuse to accept that their
lives are completely meaningless.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Especially women.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, why would a life suddenly become
important only because you are about to die?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">People come here and give up.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">It's pathetic.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">So what's the alternative?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Carry on with futile
hospital treatments?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">More suffering, for
even higher bills?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think so...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Thankfully, places like this allow
those of us who can afford it -</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- to pay for a comfortable death.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">In the end, we're all pathetic.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">That's quite artistic, don't you think?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, to be one with the night</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">one with myself</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">with the candles flame which
looks me in the eyes...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">unfathomable and still</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">one with the aspen</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">like trembles and whispers</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">one with the crowds of the flowers
leaning out of the darkness</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">and listening to something
I had on my tongue to say</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">but never got said...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">something I don't want to
reveal, even if I could.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">And the flame rises</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">It is as though the flowers crowded</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">nearer, nearer</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">and nearer the light</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">in a rainbow of shimmering points</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Aspen trembles and plays,
the evening roots go on.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I will do my best.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">And all that was inexpressible</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">and distant</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">and inexpressible</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">and near.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I sing about the only
thing that reconciles</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">only of what is practical</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">To all alike...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I'm tring to think about the things
that have been beautiful in my life.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Like what?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Just small...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">everyday things, really.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Sunrises.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">When it's cold in winter and
you come into the warm.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Soft things.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I've never had particularly great sex.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- No?
- No.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe I was just scared.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I think I've spent my entire
life being scared.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Of what?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me about the best
sex you've ever had.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, I don't know...
(laughs)  Umm...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Well there was this time, in Madrid.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">It was after a dinner with this gallery
artist after an exhibition.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">You have sex with the gallery artist?
- No, it wasn't.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">It was his son.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">And the son also had a
very cute girlfriend.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Go on.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Go on?? What do you want me to say?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Details. I want details.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">They drove me to my hotel -</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- and I guess had way too
much to drink -</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- and definitely.. I couldn't guess what...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">well, they just asked if they could
 join me up to my room, really...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- They did?
- Yeah.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Did you like it?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. I want to know.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Really, what do you want me to say?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Details? Details, you want me to tell how she
unbuttoned my blouse and how she kissed my breasts?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, you tell me! I want to know everything.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Becasue, you owe me</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">We went up to my room.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">She took my hand...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">and she laid me down on the bed.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">And then she pulled my knickers aside
and let her tongue slide in.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">He unbuttoned his trousers
and walks across the room...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">towards the bed and I turned
around and I pulled her up her skirt...</font>

- When was this?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I do not know.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Summer, like four or five years ago.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">August. Five years ago.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">How long have you been awake?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- Coffee?
- Yes please.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have any idea how much
work it is to arrange a funeral?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- You won't be arranging mine, will you?
- Emilie</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">You'll just hire some party
planner to sort it all out.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">No...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">So while I was burying Mum alone -</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- were you in Madrid having
the best sex of your life.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I just can't stand what goes through someones head
when they don't turn up to their own mothers funeral</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe it was a case of
being constructive.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">She was dead already.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">You don't automatically become a better person
 just because you've lived your life in floods of tears.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck!!</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it!  Stop it!</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">What is it? What happens?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- (Emilie gasping)  I cannot breathe.
- Yes, you can. Yes you can. Shhhhh...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Gently... Gently</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to feel this like this!!</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I do not want to be the kind of
person who who feels like this!</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Emilie, you can do this. You know you can.
Don't be afraid. Come on.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, you can do this. Come on.
Come on, we'll go to a quiet place.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">No point talking when you're like
 this, you have to calm down.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- I want to know why.
- What?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">- Why don't you respect me?
- Here we go...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">You treat me like shit!</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">You left me to take care of mum.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">In and out of hospital just
trying to keep her alive.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I waited for you to call. She
asked for you, do you know that?</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">And I lied. Different lies all the time...</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">"She swamped at work. Yeah, she
called yesterday, but she's broken her leg."</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">I just couldn't tell her you
didn't give a fuck about us.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">You know I can't be responsible
 for your happiness!</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">It just doesn't work that way!
 Life doesn't work that way.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">You're not human.
You think like a machine.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">You don't get any bonus points in heaven, just
 because walk around feeling so bloody sorry for yourself!</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe that's not the world you
want to live in, but that's how it is.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">That's reality. That's what it's like to ge a grown-up.
Sometimes you have to shut things down to survive.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">That's what everything has
always been about.</font>
<font color="#ffffff" face="Comic Sans MS">You, and your fucking survival.</font>

 as if I am hugging refugee?</font>

in a few years time</font>

 the person you perhaps really are...</font>

each other - dragged each other down.</font>
