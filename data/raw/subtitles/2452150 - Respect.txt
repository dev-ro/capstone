[C.L.] Ree?
Ree?
Wake up, baby.
They wanna hear you sing.
You wanna sing?
Yes, please.
All right.
[indistinct chatter
and laughter]
Clarence,
Ella's looking for you.
Wait here, Ree.
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.
[woman] They butchered
my essay.
Took all the politics out.
Can you believe that?
Communism is absolutely
for the Negro.
How else are we gonna have
everything we ever wanted?
Now, how does
a man with one eye
play like he has four hands?
You been practicing?
Yes, Mr. Tatum.
[woman] She could hit
three octaves easy.
[man] You know, you the finest
looking cat here, right?
Nigga, I know that.
What else you got?
Hey, Ree.
Hey, Uncle Sam.
[Sam] No more segregated
clubs for me.
I'm not walking through
no one's kitchen
to get to the stage.
[woman] I said to them,
"I'm so happy to be performing in England,
but just remember
there's only one Heaven,
one Earth,
and one queen.
Me. Dinah Washington."
[chuckles]
"That Elizabeth on y'alls
throne is an imposter."
- You didn't.
- Oh, yes, I did.
- And I made 'em bow before me.
- [chuckles]
Well, look out, y'all.
The entertainer is here.
Hi.
[Duke] He said he wanted
a race novel.
Sure, he desegregated
the army.
But he didn't do
a damn thing after that.
- Hi, Aunt Ella. Uncle Duke.
- Hey.
[C.L.] You ready, Ree?
Come on.
Excuse me? [clears throat]
Everyone.
Everyone.
For those of you visiting
my home for the first time,
this is my daughter, Aretha.
She'd like to sing
a little something for you.
What would you
like to sing, Ree?
How old is she?
She's 10,
but her voice's
going on 30, honey.
[C.L.] Aretha would
like to perform
My Baby Likes to Bebop.

Don't look at me

I'm not afraid.
- Oh, you're not?
- No.
Well, damn.
Then you need to be
leadin' this movement
and teaching me how to not be
terrified of these
crazy white folks.
- [Aretha] Martin...
- [indistinct chatter]
Why do you want to march?
After all this time
traveling with you,
after all the horror
we've seen,
what kind of question is that?
Are you runnin'
from your daddy?
No.
So, you tell him
you wanna march?
I don't have to.
It's my decision.
I'm a grown woman, remember?
[laughs] Oh, so, you ready
to orphan your kids now, hmm?
- Are you?
- No.
But you're doing it anyway.
Because I have to.
- And I don't?
- Ree...
Singing for the movement
and sending people
into battle with a song
is not enough anymore.
I need to be with them.
You have a good talk?
Yes.
It was a good talk.

I heard
you're cuttin' a record.
Yeah, with Berry
over at Motown.
They got some
sweet sounds, Ree.
They're signing a bunch of
folks in the neighborhood.
Listen, we are trying
to put Detroit on the map.
You gotta be a part of it.
- I would love that.
- Yeah?
Cecil, let me talk
to Daddy about it.
Don't bring it up until I say.
You know what?
Let's let Berry talk to him.
[Cecil] Better yet, his sister.
She can talk ice
out of the devil's mouth.
[Smokey chuckles]
What are you drinking?
Iced tea.
Just iced tea?
- With a little bourbon.
- [chuckles]
Yeah, you look
like a bourbon girl.
How long are you in town for?
[Aretha] A week.
Then I return to Tennessee.
Well, then,
I won't waste any time.
[Aretha] Mm.
- I'd like to take you out.
- Hmm.
I'd like you to take me out.
How about tonight?
Ree!
Come and help me
set this table.
Yes, to tonight.
- Okay.
- Excuse me a moment.
Reverend.
I put up with you coming
to my house all these years
'cause you were friends
with my friends.
But I don't want you
around here anymore.
May I give you some counsel,
Reverend?
Ephesians 6:4 says, "Fathers,
do not exasperate
your children.
Instead, bring them up
in the training
and the instruction
of the Lord."
[laughing]
Lord, give me strength.
Are you serious?
You may wanna loosen

about Aretha.
There were many
who were interested
in working with her.

[C.L.] I've always seen Aretha
as more than a gospel singer.
Well, clearly from her demo,
she's so much more.
[chuckles]
Stand up, Ree.
Turn around.
There can sometimes be
a lack of effortlessness
of the kind you find
in a Lena Horne
or a Dorothy Dandridge.
But what Aretha lacks
in formal education,
she more than makes up for
in experience.
She has performed before every
type of crowd imaginable,
from small churches
to audiences of thousands.
You can sit down now, Ree.
[chuckles] I... I'm curious.
Who are your favorite artists?
Dinah Washington.
Ella Fitzgerald.

Sam would very much

Oh, there we go. [chuckles]
Hmm.
I didn't know you were

[C.L.] You are 68 minutes late.
Mr. Hammond
asked me to come in.
You've been skipping
interviews and gigs.
The demon is back.
Ree has a tendency
to indulge her pain.
Can we talk about this
somewhere else?
[C.L.] John. John.
It's important that you
understand that this behavior
is not a reflection
of her upbringing or her race.
[John] Well, I've worked
with Bessie Smith
and Billie Holiday.
Aretha is a saint
in comparison.
She wasn't raised in
a whorehouse like them.
She was raised
in a proper home
with every convenience
and luxury.
But still, a darkness
would descend on her.
I called it the demon.
She'd lock herself away,
wouldn't speak, move,
just wallow
in whatever imaginary...
I...
You told me before
we came out here
that you had it under control.
I have control.
You keep complaining
that you don't have any hits.
This is why
you don't have any hits.
Acting like a trifling...
Apologize to Mr. Hammond.
No, there's no need
to apologize.
That is not why
I don't have hits.
You don't pick
good songs for me.
Sorry for being late,
Mr. Hammond.
It won't happen again.
I'm ready to record
when you are.
[C.L.] Hmm.
Please excuse me while
I go to the ladies' room.

What?
To hear you sing.
Just for me.
What will I get in return?
The best night of your life.

No.
What about the best night
of my life?

it would be tonight.

I bought them.
Which one you like best?
They've all got something.
Is this one your favorite?
Hmm?
Or this?
What are you doing?
Or this one?
Went to 64 on the charts.
You didn't even open this one.
You don't like them?
I didn't say that.
Then say it.
I won't be upset.
No one does.
First, I've listened
to all your albums.
Including this one.
More than once.
Secondly, I love music.
I take it seriously.
I managed my first artist
when I was 15.
Thirdly, what you
experienced yesterday,
17 takes on one song?
That happens to me
every time I hear you sing.
My brain gets all...

Well, first,
my apologies for putting
you through so much pain.

Okay, Miss Franklin.
What songs would
you like to sing?
I want hits.
[Ted] We're done
with standards.
We want original songs
made for Aretha only.
Great! We are speaking
the same language, my man.
One of the songwriters
I represent
wrote a good song for Aretha,
I Never Loved A Man.
Terrific. I've got the perfect
place to record it.
I'm working with
this little studio
down in Alabama and...
Aretha's only recorded
in New York.
Yeah, I know that, but I think
that's part of the problem.
It's overproduced,
it's a little too polished.
I mean, these boys
down there...
"Boys"?
Don't be offended, all right?
I say boys because
they're young like Aretha,
like Miss Franklin,
not because they're Negroes.
These guys are
the best musicians
I have ever
worked with in my life,
and that's saying something.
I've been doing this
a long time.
They don't need
to read charts.
They just feel their way
through the music.
It's really something.
How does that sound to you?
Sounds good.
And I'm not controlling
like Hammond, okay?
I'm gonna give you
plenty of space
to do your thing, all right?

What is soul music?
The musician having
the biggest influence
on this genre
is Grammy-winning soul singer,
Aretha Franklin.
From a young age,
I saw Aretha possess
extraordinary talent.
Ted is my husband, manager,
and favorite critic.
Hello, Ted.
Right now, gospel is
the main influence
on contemporary
rhythm and blues,
and that's due to Aretha.
Others have mixed
gospel and so-called
secular music before her,
but Aretha puts
a unique spin on it
that people can relate to.
It's always great
when families sing together
because there's a language
between siblings
that you can't recreate
with just hired hands.
Ain't No Way is a song
written by Carolyn for Aretha,
and something Aretha
can relate to because,
I think, they know
each other so well.
Show me how the melody
goes in the verse.

[music stops]
You really feelin' this one,
aren't you, Ree?
- I love it.
- [Erma chuckles]
I can tell.
See, so, she's just
being completely honest
in a song about
what she feels
at any given moment.
And that's why
the audience relates to her.
I'm still trying
to figure out who I am.
I'm not sure yet,
but I'm trying
to find the answer.
[cheering and applauding]
Now, I am here
to honor Aretha.
Or Ree, as I like
to call her... [laughs]
...for her tireless work
for the Civil Rights Movement.
Every time
I ask Aretha to sing
at a fundraiser,
church event, or a conference,
she shows up.
[audience shouts in agreement]
No matter where she is
or what she's doing,
- she always answers the call.
- [cheering]
And I am honored
to present Aretha
with this proclamation today.
[audience cheering
and applauding]
And I wish that every day
was Aretha Franklin Day!
[woman] We love you, Aretha!
After all of that,
there's really only one thing
left to say, right?

Excuse me, Miss Franklin.
I'm so sorry to bother you,
- but I just have to tell you.
- It's all right.
When you sing,
I feel like you are
talking about my life.
It helps me,
because it is hard out here.
But I feel like
you understand,
and, well, I just
have to thank you.
Stay strong.
Okay.
Yes, thank you.
Thank you very much.
We have to go now.
I'm flying to Atlanta tomorrow
to do a benefit for SNCC.
Cancel it.
I have some meetings
and interviews lined up.
No.
Daddy and Martin
asked me to do it.
- I'm going.
- [elevator bell dings]
[applause]
Aretha!
[Aretha] Jerry.
Oh, I love
when you call me Jerry.
It means you're not mad at me.
Hello, Ted.
Jerry.
Come on in.
[Ken] Everyone wants you,
Miss Franklin.
We've got interest in France,
England, Germany...
[Jerry] All right, we don't
have to name every country.
All of Europe.
The entire continent wants you
and I think we should
schedule something.
We should schedule a tour
that coincides
with the new album.
We could do that
or we could send her out now
to create an appetite
for the new record.
I think that's best.
I have six venues
ready to clear this...
And who are you,
brother?
Ken Cunningham.
I'm the tour manager.
[Ted] Tour manager?
So, you already
booked the tour?
It's not booked.
[Ted] No, he said
the venues was ready.
[Jerry] That's right. They were
available if we want 'em.
You have to gauge
interest early for it.
- I know how a tour works.
- [Jerry] Okay.
- No.
- No what?
[Ted] No European tour dates.
[Jerry] Why not?
[Ted] Because
we have some TV dates
we'd like to schedule first.
Oh, yeah? With whom?
Carol Burnett, Andy Williams.
Mike Douglas.
All right. So, those shows
will be there
when she gets back.
We have a chance here
to expand her reach
around the world.
To make her
a global superstar.
Do you know what
a rare opportunity that is?
We're considering
some movie offers as well.
[Jerry] Movies?
Aretha. You wanna do movies?
I think I could.
Of course you could.
You could do
any damn thing you want.
You thought you could
just bring us in here,
tell us where to go,
what to do,
and send us on our way?
You should know by now, Jerry,
that is not the way
I do business.
Ken, how much money
could Aretha make on the tour?
Quarter of a million.
[Jerry] Carol Burnett
payin' that?
Movies payin' that?
We'll consider it.
With the right band.
[Jerry] All right.
Well, the Muscle Shoals guys
have started their own label.
King Curtis is ready to go.
- Curtis is rockin'.
- [Jerry] He's perfect for you.
Curtis is good, but I've got
some people lined up.
Really? Five minutes ago,
you didn't wanna
go on this tour.
Now, you've got
people lined up?
Check the tone, Jerry.
Just take it easy, Ted.
I'm sorry.
Forgive me for my tone.
What musicians
do you have lined up, Ted?
[Ted] George Davidson.
Miller Brisker.
Russell Conway.
All right. You can't have
the premier singer of our time
touring Europe with a ragtag
bunch of amateurs
suitable for backing
some third-rate blues singer
in a bucket of blood
in Loserville, Louisiana.
I want to use Ted's musicians,
Mr. Wexler.
"Mr. Wexler"?
Oh, God. Aretha, please.
Can we move on
to the next item
on the agenda, please?
Whatever you say,
Miss Franklin.
[Ken] So, they do
this funny thing in Amsterdam
when they really
love a performer.
They pelt them with flowers.
Pardon me.
I warned them not
to get too crazy with it,
but you might
get hit with a few.
After the show, please.
After the show.
Right through this door.
Watch your step.

I Never Loved A Man

You're a lying, no good,

- Of course you can.
Um, I'll be right there
when you need me.
They need leadership, Ree.
You should see
the way these fools
are steppin' over
Martin's body to be in charge.
I don't want no part of that.
And these young
revolutionaries out here,
they don't want
no part of what we built.
They want to free our people.
They all talk.
Not all of them.
I like Angela Davis.
She don't care
about public opinion
and she's not afraid
to speak up
to those pigs or anyone else.
- Pigs?
- Yes, pigs.
You saw what they did to us
during the rebellion.
Riots.
Why shouldn't we fight back?
And start a full-on war?
You think we can win that?
We're tired of gettin'
our heads kicked in.
Non-violence
got us our civil rights
and our right to vote.
At what price? Our souls?
Our dignity?
[C.L.] Hmm.
I've been thinking.
We should hit the road again.
Why not?
A northern tour.
Me preachin' and you singin'.
[Aretha] Mm-mmm.
Just think on it.
You don't gotta
decide tonight.
I'm not doing that, Daddy.
I know you got
your very busy tourin'
and recordin' schedule.
This won't interfere
with that.
- I won't interfere with that.
- No.
I'm done with that.
I can't go back
to headlining with you.
You're not walkin'
in the spirit anymore.
That is not true.
You're drinking
and you're whoring around.
Same as you!
You not too old for me
to knock you on your ass!
- You know that, right?
- Is everything all right?
Just mind your own business!
I'm talkin' to...
Don't talk to her like that.
Have you lost your mind, huh?
Maybe.
Maybe I found it.
Come on, let's get you to bed.
Just...
Just don't.
- I heard your conversation.
- Mm...
I'm not sorry.
No, no, you ain't got nothin'

[choir] ♪ In the morning... ♪
An all-gospel record
has a very limited audience.
- I don't care.
- You do care.
You sat in that office
with me six years ago,
and you said
you wanted to make hits,
and I think you still do.
I'm making this album, Jerry.
All right, can you just
hear me out, please?
I'm making this album,
or I'll never make an album
with you again.
All I wanna do
is drink now, Jerry.
Well, let me get you
into a program.
I'm in a program,
but I need the church.
I need the spirit.
It has always
gotten me through,
and it will get me
through again.
Okay. Well, can we just...
I... I mean,
just think about this...
This album is not for me
or for you or anybody else.
This album is for God.
And you can't jive God, Jerry,
so stop trying.
- [chuckles]
- [Jerry] Oh.
I'm not trying to jive you
or Jesus, okay?
It's the gospel record.
It's 1972, for Christ's sake.
Sorry. I...
Hey,
how about we make
a documentary film
to go along with the record?
Why?
So, the international fans,
the hippies,
the atheists like me
can see you in your element
and understand the music
that made you.
You mean for white people?
Well, I...
All right. Yes.
That's a great idea.
[laughs] Okay. Well, good.
So, you're not gonna leave me?
We're not done yet.
Oh, boy. What?
I want to produce
the album, too.
Oh.
[Jerry sighs]
All right. Okay. Okay.

Ree...
Ree, the spirit is the spirit.
It moves when it moves.
What you want us to do?
Behave like Episcopalians?
Now what's really
bothering you?
[inhales deeply]
You told me once
that music would save my life.
I did.
What if it doesn't?
The demon is strong.
Ain't no demon
hauntin' you, Ree.
There never was.
Just the pain you've been
runnin' from your whole life.
But you gotta let it go, Ree.
Give it to God.
It wasn't your fault.
[sniffles]
And He knows that.
I don't know about tomorrow
or the concert or the album
or the documentary.
You in church right now.
You're safe.
So, Ree,
let's have church.
[muffled synth music playing]
Daddy.
It's good to see you.
We were in California, and
we heard that you were
singing gospel, and...
Clara dragged me here.
Clara can't make
you do anything.
She's got pretty feisty
since you last saw her.
Glad you came.
That surprises me,
'cause we haven't been
getting on as of late.
You told me I wasn't
walking in the spirit.
I was angry.
You were with God.
You have always been with God.
He was with me.
I tried to run from Him,
but He brought me back.
Like Jonah.
Like Jonah.
You taught me every song
I'm singing today.
I did my best.
But you have exceeded
all of my expectations, Ree.
I'm about to bust wide open,
and you're just
getting started.
I can't imagine
what you're gonna do next.
Because you can
do anything, Ree.
First, give an honor to God
who's the head
of all our lives.
- Yes. Amen.
- [applause]
I'm sure you all have
noticed the cameras by now.
Don't get distracted by it.
We here to have church, right?
- [congregation] Amen.
- [James] All right.
This is the first
religious recordin'
by our First Lady of Soul.
