They followed me home.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Liar.
Come on, let's go.
I got it especially for you.
Are we ready?
Detective O'Mally
with the Deerfield Police
Department
second precinct.
This is Mr. Farber
from Child Protective Services.
Sir, can you please
state your name
for the record?
Francis Stark.
Mr. Stark,
can you tell us
where you were last night?
Uh, last night
was Christmas, right?
It was Christmas, sir.
Were you with your son, Herman,
and his family?
No.
Ever since my wife died,
I just stay right here,
just me and Calli.
I'm sorry, who?
Calli, my cat.
She's scared of people
- so she's probably in her house.
- Okay.
Sir, did anything unusual
happen last night?
Uh, I got a knock on the door.
Do you know who it was?
My grandson, Little Willee.
Can you tell us
how a 10-year-old boy
managed to get across town
through 10 miles
of densely wooded forest
in the middle of the night
on Christmas?
Uh, my guess is the Injun.
- The who?
- Native man.
Did you know the man?
Never seen him
before in my life.
Didn't say anything,
just left me the boy.
Mr. Stark,
your behavior seems
very strange.
Uh, do you fully understand
what happened last night
at your son's house?
Do you know
where your grandson is
right now Mr. Stark?
Yeah. Right up there
on the first door on the right.
Can we speak with him?
You can try,
but he hasn't said anything
to anybody since he got here.
Can you bring
the camera?
William?
Hey, Willee?
He said
the door on the right.
On the right?
This never would've happen
if Herman remembered
to lock the bulkhead, right?
He's, uh...
Willee?
William, are you in here?
Don't look
like he's here.
The closet.
- William, is that you?
- Hey, buddy.
- Detective.
- Hey, Willee.
William,
we're here to help you.
Come on.
Mind coming out and speaking...
- No!
- It's okay, bud.
It's okay. It's okay.
Hey, Dave,
when are you coming in?
I told you the boy
doesn't wanna speak.
No, thank you.
Hey,
what's going on up there?
Detective.
Leave him alone!
Hello?
Realtor showing.
Hello?
Realtor showing.
Rita.
Hey.
How's it working
over there?
The contractors quit.
I'm not sure if the painters
are coming back.
Oh, my gosh.
Has anyone heard
from the son yet?
He'll have to pack up
his father's things
before we can show the house.
Things just keep getting
worse for this family.
So sad.
I just can't believe it.
This is definitely
a tough listing.
I'll try to send
some buyers your way.
Yeah.
Hang in there.
Okay. Bye.
Come here.
Well, good morning,
everyone,
and thank you for tuning in.
Well, they say
if the lights aren't on,
don't go knocking.
But as you know,
we're always keeping
our airwaves open for you.
This is 93.7 Deerfield's choice
for easy listening.
Come here.
Neil from Rose Ledge.
Yeah.
Hey, Meadow.
Hey, Will,
we got a propane truck
rollover down in Deerfield.
Why don't you grab
the service truck,
have Owen take 70
and I'll take the rotator?
Yeah, well, I got this lawyer
on the phone, third time,
calling about
your father's ashes,
wondering when you're gonna
even come pick them up.
Says it's urgent.
If you need to talk, brother,
I'm here.
My condolences
on the untimely death
of your father.
The family home was placed
into foreclosure
after the bank had made
several attempts
to recover some
delinquent mortgage payments
and they have since
assigned an agent
who will help facilitate
the actual sale of the home.
When was the last time
that you spoke
to your father, William?
Would you say weeks,
or months,
or years?
Uh, years.
Over the past 10 years,
your father had been admitted
to mental health facilities
throughout the state
of Massachusetts.
He had treatment
for schizophrenia,
psychotic episodes,
and multiple
personality disorder.
And with his health issues,
he incurred medical expenses
that he struggled to pay.
With the home's
unfortunate history
and with the internet,
it's difficult
not to have people know
what took place there,
which unfortunately affects
the value of the home.
As the state
appointed trustee,
it is my duty, at the behest
of your father,
to transfer the title
of home ownership to you,
the beneficiary.
And it was your father's wishes
that his ashes be scattered
on the property.
This is yours,
if you'll just sign
the line at the bottom
of the document, please.
Hey, what? What?
Donovan.
Where?
No. It's just,
when they said
"lateral transition",
I didn't think
that meant "meter maid".
I'm on my way.
Ava! The bus is gonna be here.
I wanna go back to Boston.
No one even talks
to me at school.
Well, I haven't talked to you.
Well, that's just
'cause you're my mom.
That's besides the point.
Hey, I'm the new kid, too.
We're in this together.
Okay?
All right. Don't be late.
Okay. Bye. Love you.
Okay. Love you, too.
Yeah, I just got here.
All right.
I'll call you back.
Two county precincts
and they send Boston Homicide
all the way out here
for a fender bender?
This doesn't violate
my visitation rights, does it?
Very funny, Drew.
Would've appreciated a call.
Come on now.
How's Ava?
Rough week at school.
Having a hard time
making friends.
She's a new kid. Every time.
She misses her father... a lot.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Neil from Rose Ledge.
- I'm Detective Donovan,
- Deerfield PD.
- Hey, what's up?
This is Detective Carter,
Boston Homicide.
We need to take
a look inside the vehicle
- before you haul it off.
- All right.
Let me know
when you're done, please.
Thank you.
What brings you out
to the sticks?
Got a call this morning
on a missing person case
I've been working.
Local Staties ran the plates,
vehicle registered to a 34-year
old woman named Brittany O'Shea,
been missing since last month.
And her daughter was found
murdered in Dorchester.
Jesus.
You think she was on the run?
Maybe.
Uh, she's from out here.
I got a call into her family,
so I'm gonna stop by
and pay them a visit.
Oh, here we go.
I'll take what's behind
door number one, Monty.
She flips the car,
makes a run for it and calls
a friend to pick her up?
Maybe.
I think. For sure.
Got everything you need?
All set.
Hey, Neil, you seen
the maintenance records
- on truck 42?
- It should be
in Herman's old
accounting office.
Will, you mind looking?
Hey, why is my mother's
piano in there?
Oh, we put it there
when your father got sick
and he started
working from home.
He was convinced
it had a mind of his own.
Said there was family
of mice living in it.
We told him
we'd donate it to a church.
Meadow?
Girl?
William,
come in here
and play with your sister.
I got it especially for you.
Heading to New Hampshire
on a tow,
won't be back till morning.
Meadow?
Girl?
Meadow?
Who are you?
Where's the gift I gave you?
What gift?
They followed me home.
Who followed you?
Meadow?
Meadow?
Meadow?
Girl?
I'm watching you.
Just got a call.
Two snowshoers
in the Deerfield area
came across
the body of a female,
aged twenties to thirties.
Wow.
You're really living out
the bachelor dream.
I just decided
to stay in town for a while,
you know, get case closure.
Your case, my jurisdiction,
so my rules.
No booze in the vehicle.
You know, if you're ever down
for date night,
this place has cable TV
and a wicked
heart-shaped Jacuzzi.
You're not funny.
And please put your seatbelt on.
I'm kind of funny.
- No. You're not.
- I think I'm funny.
- Ava thinks I'm funny.
- That... well, that makes one.
One's all I need.
I think we found
our Brittany O'Shea.
Fresh out of the big city
and you already
got your first stiff.
Did I ever tell you
about my first 10-54
when I joined the force?
No.
But I'm sure you will anyway.
It was a mill worker from Gill.
Jumped off the Bascule Bridge
on the upswing
in the dead of winter.
Ice broke his fall...
and his legs.
Unlucky for him,
the impact didn't kill him.
- Morning.
- How you doing, sir?
Poor bastard froze to death
by the time we found him.
How I've missed
our morning chats.
Goddamn. Jesus.
Looks like
she's been out here a while.
Yup. That's her.
Did you take a look at this?
Geez, what the hell are those?
Man, looks like she was branded.
Who were you running from,
Brittany?
Necrophiliacs
Anonymous, may I help you?
Very funny.
How's my favorite coroner?
We found
a match for the markings
on the O'Shea girl.
Really? Go ahead.
Have you ever heard
of the Stark/Codder murders?
Will you pass me
a three-quarter wrench?
Those are freakin'
bite marks bro.
Maybe he's into kinky shit.
No. Animal bites.
How do you know the difference?
I'm telling you, Owen.
Something ain't right.
When's anything
ever been right with Will?
You need to return it
to its rightful home, William,
before it's too late.
William Stark
was the only witness
to the murders
of his mother and sister.
He recently moved back
into town, and get this,
he works for the company
that towed Brittany's car
the other day.
That is quite a coincidence.
Now, I need to check this kid,
see if we can fill in any holes.
Will?
Will?
William Stark!
Detective Carter
Boston Homicide.
You remember me. Yeah?
Maybe you remember
the white Ford Explorer
that flipped over the other day?
How many of those
you get this week?
You recognize that vehicle,
Will?
I... I don't...
I don't think so. Why?
Because it belongs
to Brittany O'Shea,
you know her, Will?
I... I don't... I don't know her.
You don't know?
Hey, would you give us a moment?
Certainly.
Thank you.
Let me rephrase that,
when was the last time you saw
or spoke to Brittany O'Shea?
I don't know.
So you knew her?
Yeah, well,
you must've seen the vehicle
was registered in her name
when you did the tow report.
You didn't think, I don't know
maybe I should mention this
to the two cops on the scene,
I knew the driver.
Things have just been
kind of a blur lately.
Where were you Tuesday night?
Am I in some kind of
trouble here?
I don't know.
Are you?
We found the body
of Brittany O'Shea
near the Deerfield River
yesterday, Will,
and a few weeks before that
I found the body
of her daughter.
That's terrible.
Yeah, it's terrible,
and you hadn't spoken
to her anytime recently?
I couldn't tell you
what Brittany looks like
if she was standing
in front of me today.
Or if she was running away
from you.
I have to get back to work.
Look, this was
an informal visit,
we can go down
to the precinct to make it
much more formal
if that's what you prefer.
Thanks for your time, Will.
If we need anything else
I know where to find you.
Just leaving
the Stark workplace,
that dude
is Creepy Magoo times two.
Class A weirdo
and when the going gets weird,
the weird turn pro.
Pull the Stark Murder files.
We discovered
a tap on your case, sir,
I'm terribly sorry
for your loss.
At this point in time,
Mr. Carter's priority
is finding your son.
Do you know where you son is?
Mr. Stark, I need you
to pull it together.
It's 10 degrees outside.
We need to find your son
right now.
Mr. Stark, where is your son?
My name is Detective Coleman.
I'm gonna ask you
some questions about last night
and I want you to do your best
to answer them
and understand, you're not
in any trouble at all, okay?
We just need to know
what happened.
Hey, Willie.
Hey, how you doing?
There is a...
there's a lady outside
saying she's a family.
All right.
Let me talk to the family.
Willie, how are you doing, bud?
I see you still have
your elephant.
It's pretty cool actually,
where did you get it?
You're grandpa...
said that you came over
to his house the other night,
you ran from your house
to his house
in the middle
of the night in the snow.
You'd be freezing.
He said that you were running
with someone else.
Were you running with a man?
All right then,
I'm gonna give you a second,
I'm gonna talk
to Detective Coleman
and, uh, we'll be back in, okay?
Atlantow.
Atlantow.
Hey, Neil?
You still here?
Girl?
I've been looking
everywhere for you.
Okay. Okay.
Just stay right here.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Just sit right here.
Right here. It's okay.
Okay. Okay.
We... we'll just talk, okay?
Let's talk.
You don't have to be afraid.
It's okay.
It's okay. We... we can...
we'll just sit here.
We'll just sit here
and we can talk
just like old times,
just like old times.
I missed old times.
You weren't
ready to go back, you know,
we shouldn't have went back.
You shouldn't have went back.
Okay. And then that's my fault
and... and I'm sorry.
It's my father.
My father...
- The prophecy.
- ...you know, he, um...
Well, that's where I got it from
and his father.
It was my father's side
of the family.
It was medication.
It was a medication you get.
You're going one way,
you're going the next way,
and... and you just...
I've never been sick before.
I always said no.
I didn't want it
and they gave it to me.
I was too young.
Something bit me.
It was the voices.
It's the voices.
So I could just... it takes you.
He wants me to build it.
She doesn't let go.
I have to build it.
But it doesn't let go.
And then he... she can't...
you can't do anything.
You... you just argue him.
She sleeps to me in my dreams.
I feel the prophecy.
Are you him? I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Uh, not again, Will.
I think you need some time off.
That's what I said.
He was looking right up
at the camera and he said,
spirit of death in Mohican.
You kidding me?
Where do you think
he picked that up?
William Starks'
grandfather reported that a man
of native descent
dropped him off
the morning after the murders.
The next day, Child Services
came to pick him up.
I mean, his grandfather
was unfit to take care of him,
and they kept running into dead
ends
looking for this mysterious man.
The... the strangest thing
I can't find though is that
the bloody pajamas Will
was wearing
the night of the murders
disappeared from the precinct
when this woman stopped by
with some clean clothes for him.
Are you and Ava
watching cartoons?
I am. She's doing her homework.
Look, I just don't buy
that a 10-year-old
could wield an axe and inflict
that kind of carnage.
Sorry, honey.
I did a search on the markings
on Brittany O'Shea's body,
portrayed upside down.
- They signify death.
- I'm more curious
how O'Shea's toxicology report
comes back.
Look, I got to head back
into Boston tonight,
- so you got Ava.
- I got a babysitter for her.
It's this nice lady
from down the street.
You get a warrant
for the Stark place, yet?
Not yet. But I'm working on it.
Can I get you boys
anything else?
Chocolate mousse cake,
apple pie?
Well, we're stuffed.
Full Circle. Thanks.
You should get home
before that nor'easter moves in.
Supposed to get
another six inches.
Dunkees on Route 24 is 24 hours.
Now if you guys
want more coffee.
Closing early. Storms coming in.
Just a quick
one for the ditch.
The sign says closed, Caleb.
Not actually.
I think that's the guy
whose family got hacked
by a hiker.
We get lost hikers knocking
on our door all the time.
No. They say the house
is haunted.
We should not sneak
into it sometime.
Crime scene photos are nuts!
He even scalped them.
Oh my God. That's nasty!
Guys, that's disgusting.
Oh my God.
Go on.
You all done here guy?
He just lost the only family
he's got left.
Have a little respect.
- You causing problems?
- He was just leaving.
- Ready to go?
- Yeah.
Be safe out there, boys.
Have a great night, Cayley.
Deerfield PD!
Hello?
Deerfield PD.
Hello?
Deerfield PD!
Somebody there?
Hello?
Who's there?
Oh, my God.
Everyone's sleeping.
I got the last jar of jam.
Merry Christmas, Mister.
Oh, I can't do it
I don't know
why you keep singing it
over and over again.
No, I keep, shit.
No, because it attracts
shut up, God.
All right.
Little girl, is that you?
Hello? Little girl?
Join with me
and thou shall ne'r
hunger again.
Thou might not but dispatch
the mother and daughter,
and retrieve the endowment.
Where is it?
Help, my baby!
Thou know'st whom I am.
Ava?
Ma'am?
I'm so sorry,
I'm riding behind today.
I just had a lot of work.
Oh, not to worry,
Ava was in good hands.
Um, well, thank you
for staying late tonight.
Um, what do I owe you?
Oh, no, no,
I couldn't, it was my pleasure.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Ava?
I wanna go back to Boston.
You used to love coming to Nana
and Papa's farmhouse.
They're dead
and this place sucks.
Ava, what are you doing
in there?
I was scared.
What? Why were you scared?
My friend bit me.
What friend?
She's a ballerina.
Ava, I need you
to come out right now,
- so I could see you.
- No.
Ava, don't make me come
in there.
No.
I promise
I'll take you to Fenway.
Green Monster seats?
In the spring,
Green Monster seats.
Wayne Codder,
40-year-old hiker
from Oklahoma gets lost
in Deerfield trails,
he's about to freeze to death,
he's starving,
he comes across the Stark house.
Herman Stark who doesn't
even have the wherewithal
on Codder's desperation,
sends him on his way
with a loaf of bread.
You're not gonna talk about it?
Hikers get lost all the time.
Camping out in yards,
knocking on doors at all hours.
They find Codder's DNA?
Forensics
only found it on jars
in the shed
and the murder weapon.
Jars? What jars?
- Only in the shed?
- Yeah.
My theory? Codder would sneak
into the Stark house
late at night
when everybody was asleep,
feast on jarred fruit,
sneak back out before sunrise
where he'd hide out in the shed.
Okay.
But why murder
an innocent family?
What's the motive?
He murders a mother and daughter
and is found dead of hypothermia
miles from the house
with the same markings we find
on Brittany O'Shea's body
25-some-odd years later?
Like there's gotta be more
to it.
What was the deal
with the father?
Herman Stark had a history
of mental health issues.
Uh, psychotic episodes,
schizophrenia,
multiple personality disorders.
He was put on a 5150
the day after the murders
and was in and out
of psych wards
for the last 25 years,
until he killed himself.
Jesus.
How does a 70-year-old man
with severe rheumatoid arthritis
reported as near crippling
managed to even get himself
in a 20-foot high beam?
Shit ton of bath salts.
Firefighters had a hell
of a time
getting him down from there.
Someone must've
put him up there.
Or something.
Do you remember that couple
back in the '70s
they did paranormal
investigations?
She was a medium
and they would collect things
that souls would attach
themselves to?
Of course I remember,
they made like
half a dozen movies
about those clowns.
You really going with this, huh?
Is it possible that this
could be a paranormal entity?
Yeah, it's possible.
Yeah. It's possible.
But what do you think,
some kind of possessed doll
put him up there?
Because I don't see
Chucky carrying a geriatric...
- I'm serious, Drew.
- I'm serious too.
I just think that
we need to go back
- to the Stark house and...
- Go back?
- ...talk to Will and maybe...
- No, no.
- ...we get some more answers...
- What you need to do is go...
- ...about this.
- ...back to Boston and take Ava.
Take some real time off,
go to a Bruins game.
That's what coming
to the farmhouse was supposed...
Get her away from the neighbor's
kid who likes to bite.
That's what coming to the
farmhouse
- was supposed to be, Drew.
- Yeah. It was supposed to be
a break from all the stress
that got you put on leave
in the first place.
Wow.
What are you not telling me?
What?
You're not still seeing
that mass hole
- from Cambridge are you?
- No.
Because I thought maybe
now that I was back in town...
- No.
- ...you and I could try,
- but if I... I...
- Drew just stop it.
Ava's asleep right now.
Just go.
Go? You're kicking me out?
I have a lot of work
I need to do
before I get Ava for school.
The vitality
of thee bloodline.
Mother and daughter
bring 'em hither.
What'd you got?
Still waiting on toxicology.
Did speak
to Brittany O'Shea's parents.
Said she'd been hanging with
some pretty scary characters.
They were afraid she's joined
some sort of a cult.
Cult?
You got a name for this group?
Negative.
But we did spend
two exciting hours
going over yearbooks,
see if there was anybody
that she went to school with
that might know
of her whereabouts.
Any luck?
Found a fourth grade
photo of Brittany O'Shea
and one young Will Stark.
The two were inseparable
leading up to the Stark murders
before Will went
into protective care.
And get this.
They even managed
to stay in touch,
writing letters with tribal-type
drawings on them.
You think he might be a member
or involved in this cult?
Could be.
If not, he might know who is.
Where are you?
I'm gonna text you coordinates.
If you don't hear from me
in the next hour,
get a search party ready.
Don't do anything reckless,
Carrie.
Reckless?
Like you knock me up
on our first date
only to break our family apart
for a cashier in a Stop N' Plop?
No, I'm not that reckless.
I've been expecting you.
Come inside.
Wife and daughter?
My mother and sister.
It's an old photo.
They're beautiful.
Thanks.
They live here with you?
They're no longer with us.
I'm sorry to hear that.
They were taken from me.
Taken?
By who?
Not by who.
By what.
Centuries ago,
when the colonizers came here
to these shores,
they brought with them conquest,
Christianity,
violence,
and prosperity.
Also a whole plethora
of diseases
that all but wiped out
the indigenous people
of these lands.
All but the Sinchanee.
My ancestors,
whose bloodline is immune.
The settlers, they were afraid.
They didn't understand.
And what you fear
and what you don't understand,
you destroy.
Destroyed by who?
By him.
Are... are you talking
about The Devil?
Atlantow.
The Spirit of Death.
Wasn't devil worshipping
in the Native culture
just a stereotype
created by settlers
to justify the genocide
of the indigenous people?
True.
But Atlantow is real.
And it was the settlers
that worshipped him.
I've got a girl
whose frozen body
was found with strange symbols
carved in her flesh.
I found geographic
coordinates in a journal
of hers that led me here
to you.
Can you tell me why
a mother of four
was so desperate to get to you
that she would drive
in the middle of the night
until she ran out of gas,
and then continue
her journey on foot
until she froze to death?
Other than to protect
her daughter?
Protect her daughter from who?
Those
that summoned Atlantow.
Those that seek
to kill and destroy
the bloodline of the Sinchanee.
Our mothers, our sisters,
those who can conceive.
Do you know your heritage?
Hey, I'll run block
while you check the shed.
All right.
Drew!
Drew, you need to come see this.
Help!
Help!
Hello?
Kid?
You okay?
Hello?
Hey, little girl.
Say something.
Kid, I'm not messing around.
Say something.
Shit!
Hey! Hey!
Drew!
Drew! We need to go!
Hey! Hey!
Please no!
No! It was just a prank!
It was just a prank!
I just wanted to see
- if the house was haunted!
- On the ground! Drop it!
Put it down! Right now!
Please no! No!
Put it down right now!
Right now!
Put the goddamn
axe on the ground!
Put it
on the ground! Right now!
I'm moving, Donovan.
- Put it down.
- Goddammit,
drop the axe.
Put it down now!
Goddammit, drop it!
Drop the goddamn axe!
Kid, get the hell out of here.
You have something of ours.
The hell is he talking
about, Carrie?
We want it back.
Now get off my land.
Hey. Hey.
Let's go.
- Brittany O'Shea!
- Hey. Hey. Stop.
- What happened to her, Will?
- Hey, let's go.
We gotta go home.
Did you do something
to her? Huh?
- Detective!
- You know something,
- don't you?
- Carrie, let's go.
- Did you do something to her?
- Carrie, let's go.
- We gotta go.
- You did something to her?
- Did you kill her, Will?
- We'll come back with a warrant.
He's getting in your head.
Come on.
- Mother and daughter.
- What?
- Come on.
- Ava.
- What...
- We need to go.
We need to go! We need to go!
Where did you say we're going?
Hello? Dorothy?
Yeah. Are you with Ava?
- What is she saying?
- Ava Carter!
- Hello? Hello?
- What did... what did she say?
Goddammit.
What is going on?
I went to this dark house
last weekend and...
- and nobody was home.
- And? And? And?
And I went inside
and some things...
What the hell happened
in that house, Carrie?
Something grabbed me!
I felt something, and it was...
I don't know what it was
but I shouldn't have taken it.
I couldn't submit it
for evidence!
Well, we can take it back, okay?
No, we can't! No, we can't!
It's... it's me! It's me!
What are you talking about?
"A mother and daughter,"
it says.
I... I... I don't understand.
- I need you to drive!
- I'm driving!
Grace?
Where'd you go?
Grace?
Grace?
Grace?
I thought you said
we were gonna play
in the forest?
Gotcha!
Come on.
We're gonna go to my house.
- Ava!
- Ava!
- Ava!
- She in there?
No!
Ava!
Ava!
Dorothy!
Ava!
Solomon.
Solomon! We need to go!
- We need to go!
- Who is Solomon?
Come on!
I should probably
be getting home now.
We're going to play at my house.
But I'm starting to get cold.
Come on. Let's go.
Ava!
Ava!
- Ava!
- Ava!
Ava!
Ava!
You're hurting me!
It's just a little further.
My brother really
wants to meet you.
I really need to go home now.
You're coming with me.
No!
Let go!
Solomon?
Solomon?
I'm watching you.
Ava!
Ava!
It's okay.
It's okay.
Give me the arrowhead.
I'll take it from here.
Go on home.
Carrie!
Carrie! Her scarf!
Where did you...
Ava!
Mom! Dad!
- Ava!
- Ava!
Fulfill the covenant
and join me
in eternal exaltation.
Atlantow!
Atlantow!
We are still here!
You have not driven us out!
Father Sky, Mother Earth,
Brother Wolf, and Sister Moon,
I call upon you!
Come down! You must help dispel
this evil from our sacred land!
He's here. He's here.
Do you not see him?
Run!
Atlantow!
I've done battle
with you before!
I've defeated you before!
I will defeat you again!
Atlantow!
Demon! Stop!
Devil!
Monster!
We will drive you out!
I cast you out!
I cast you out!
I cast you out!
You came back.
You are my blood.
Sinchanee blood.
Sinchanee medicine.
Medicine of your people.
Here, put the arrow
at the heart.
Drink.
Your mother,
your sister,
you, Will, Sinchanee.
And you we are the last.
Stay strong, Will.
Stay strong.
You're brave, Will.
No, no, no, no.
Be brave Will.
Be brave.
Atlantow, we cast you out
from this sacred land!
Stay in the course.
Stay in the course.
No. No.
- Keep going.
- No, no, no.
- Keep going.
- No, no.
You came back to me.
I guess I owe you an apology.
Where you heading?
Road trip.
I'm here when you're ready
to talk.
As soon as the department gets
the funds that they requested,
who knows what secrets
they'll dig up around here.
You know, you probably
don't wanna do that.
See you around, Will.
Hold on, Emerson.
You don't even have
to lock the doors around here.
Gotta love that.
Oh, I know.
This is gonna be the perfect
new start to our little family.
And we got a few minutes
before the movers get here.
Where's Emerson?
Uh, she's just trying
to find her new room.
Emerson?
Emerson?
Where did you go, baby?
There you are.
You scared, mommy.
Where did you get those?
It's a secret.
