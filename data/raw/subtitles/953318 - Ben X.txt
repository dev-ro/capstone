 I can not explain. </ I>
 I cannot explain myself. </ I>
 I cannot lie. </ I>
 Everything I say is true, </ i>
 Even if I dont speak. </ I>
There should always be a first death.
Otherwise, nothing happens.
Otherwise it's never a problem.
Otherwise, everything is always on.
No.
There must always be someone dying first.
Based on true events
And then everyone suddenly reacts.
But too late.
So there were deaths.
Every morning I  game </ i>
 From 5.45 pm to 6.33 pm. Always. </ I>
 I have reached level 80. </ I>
 If you never heard of it</ i>
 That's just ... high </ i>.
 This means that you are strong. </ I>
 Respected in the world. </ I>
 Hundreds of thousands of people online. </ I>
 But Ive played for more than a year </ i>
 Only together with her. </ I>
Scarlite says:

That  dick you see in the mirror. </ I>
 The one i have to teach everything. </ I>
 Teach him to laugh, for example. </ I>
That people finds  nice. </ I>
 And smile. "</ I>
That means  </ i>
 That there is really nothing to laugh about. </ I>
 So create your own avatar </ i>.
 Twenty seconds for my hands. </ I>
And fifteen  for my hair. </ I>
 You are as strong as</ i>
 Weapons and your tools. </ I>
 My heart rate, for example. To </ i>
 My heart to keep, as they say. </ I>
For  if I am getting nervous. </ I>
 Not that I am less nervous </ i>
 but i can always tell </ i>
 exactly  </ i>
 how nervous i am </ i>.
Good morning, Ben.
 People always say that. No matter </ i>.
  if it is a good morning or not. </ I>
Good morning, mama.
Did you sleep well, boy?
'Very good sleep, mama.
Fine glad you asked. Thank you. '
Have you already seen my troll, Ben?
 My brother Jonas. </ I>
 He is still small. </ I>
 And I try to be his big brother. </ I>
The Trolls have no horses.
 But I never know exactly </ i>
 How this works. </ I>
Quietly, Ben. Quietly.
Quiet, yes.
We can not allow it to your heart.
'Yes, mama. "
- Yes, mama. Do not let my heart.
In your heart, boy. Sure
You may leave things in your heart.
Just think carefully
And quiet.
Give me 'a kiss.
Till later.
But  better. </ I>
 Better noise </ i>.
 I think </ i>.
 And especially thinking </ i>.
Equipped , everything before. </ I>
Everything is  planning, </ i>
 All is strategy. </ I>
I can not say
I was totally surprised ...
But it proved just ...
That everything had happened so far,
That really could not.
Before you do something,
Must surely al ..
To me that was just 't proof that ...
Now it's just too much.
It is too much.
 People are strange. </ I>
 They just talk and talk and talk</ i>.
 And they drink saliva from each other. </ I>
 I can only look </ i>.
 Observe, as you say. Imitate. </ i>.
 All I will never learn. </ I>
 Because there was always something with me. </ I>
 Something with me and my hand. </ I>
Pass.
What is with you on the hand,
We will never know, eh.
 Mis </ i>.
- What's wrong with you?
 I am the man where something wrong with it. </ I>
 But no one who could tell me ...</ i>
 How I could do really right. </ I>
Hi, queers.
Pat has a new girlfriend.
A good thing.
Go and sit, dear.
Not wrong, eh? From a old barn
Which is on fire, jumping off sparks.
You know how to feel your hand if you
put it in her trousers?
I usually will not know.
Once it's a horse
A sugarcube?
 Bogaert and Desmet </ i>.
 I am their best friend. </ I>
Thats  what they say anyway. </ I>
Hi, there is Benny. Our best friend.

The clam?
Hi, Benny Boy.
The Marsman. Hello.
Whitney Houston for Benny Boy.
Come in, Benny Boy. Over.
Over, Benny Boy.
Do you read me?
Hi, Benny Boy.
Youve become deaf from masturbation.
- What is it all for you?
 Extinguish ...</ i>
 Why are they doing this? </ I>
If I  calmly played on a Saturday, they thought </ i>
 That my ears could not hear. </ I>
 The doctor said that I had a very good hearing</ i>
 but I could not listen. </ I>
He does not listen.
 When they said that perhaps something </ i>
 is shielding my eyes</ i>.
Do you see any letters there?
- Yes.
Can you tell me what letters?
- Yes.
It is the intention that you will tell me
which letters there.
C-H-O-Z-T-S-Z-N-D-C-K-V-C ...
When he was a baby he was always
looking away ...
He never looked at me.
He always looked through me.
You have to see if a computer
Which is configured completely different.
They see it all.
They see each sheet very sharp,
But see the tree.
They see the trees literally
But not the forest.

'Whitney Houston for Benny Boy.
We have a problem. "
For Benny Boy. The Marsman.
Every year you have a few.
Always alone in the school playground.
It is heartbreaking to see.
But yes, what do you then?
You can hold their hand hard.
And certainly no longer.
I wanted my son
To go to a normal school.
My wife, my ex-wife and I
had a quarrel.
But he was much smarter
than some of those other kids.
Three, five, ten times smarter.
An understandable question:
Where is God?
Where is this man
With its large, gray beard?
With all these wars and poverty
and injustice ... Where is God?
The interesting thing is that people who question
in the time of Jesus also questioned.
Because Jesus hung there 't cross
And she said:
'Jesus, why do you do nothing?
If your boss is creator of the universe. 
If you can rise anyone from the dead?
Then this is child's play.
Click, clack and you are free. "
Jesus also suggests that question.
What's in the New Testament?
On the ninth hour Jesus cried
with loud voice:
"My God, my God,
Why have thou forsaken me? "
Jesus himself takes the time
Also that question.
He was humiliated and beaten.
They have destroyed him.
Jesus himself doubts God.
He can go in death.
Actually Jesus committed suicide.
So he rises.
Until the resurrection.
And that means that God ...
Goddammit, Bogaert!
Leave Ben alone!
I dont think this is the first time
I have daid that.
You get problems with me.
Ben is a bit different than you,
Than the deplorable average here.
And if your ask me, boft he says.
Apparently it's difficult to accept
that someone is a bit different.
Or do you want to tell us something,
Mr. Bogaert?
Something about a text that you last night
have been studied extensively?
Yes.
- I know something.
We are burning of curiosity,
Mr. Bogaert.
Does anyone know what Jesus said
When he was crusified?
'Hey, first my feet. "
That is very cute. 'My God,
Why have thou forsaken me? "
One question that I, believe me,
ask myself several times every day.
Hi quietly.
Calm, please.
Ben, do not opnaaien
By those guests. Stay just quiet.
That kind of lazy birds for the cat.
They have no chance.
They have forever a patch
stuck on his foot.
The fact that the director had said
That it had.
He has run around all day
with that patch.
He always had sandwiches with them.
But he has never been able to eat.
But yes, what can you do?
What we always do. Too little. Nothing.
That is our darling.
Hi, Benny Boy?
- Baby Jesus.
Leave him alone.
It will not be easy,
Eh, Benny Boy, why so different?
Quietly.
- Better than the average.
You are really our great example,
Eh, Ben? You are it.
 Quietly, quietly. </ I>
 Just stay quiet. </ I>
 Plain, ordinary, ordinary. </ I>
 Smiles </ i>.
 'Like a laugh', they said. </ I>
Then  it would 't stop. </ I>
 Then they would have to stop. </ I>
Filming.
Action.
Queer.
Loser.
Dirty queer.
- Loser.
Look at me, boy.
If you 't tell me,
I can 't not recommended, Vertriest.
Look. My favorite customers.
The tenth time is free, eh.
- And why is that, do you think?
I do not know.
- You have really no idea?
Is it a quiz?
Do you find it funny, Desmet?
I honestly think this is not
at all funny.
You have apparently Vertriest ...
How will I 't say ... Bullied.
A little plagued. Not bullied.
- We do this together.
The difference is that a normal man
understands the joke, sir.
We still try to be normal
to him. We still talk with him.
But normally it is quite bad.
We are not those who throw chairs
throught the window, sir.
It is also not easy.
Let but, save that theatre 
for the school.
And you ...
Now it's time to talk, my friend.
Say it. Say it.
Tell me what those two clowns
did wrong again.
But yes ...
With hindsight is easy talk, eh.
Well, easy ...
I mean ...
You feel like a former combatant
After a war that you have lost.
I almost no longer know how often I
have been in all these schools.
And always the same story.
At this school ...
We try pupils
to prepare for this hard world.
And they are.
And sometimes not.
About that glass you need . ..
The director said  </ i>
 That they be allowed </ i>.
 If I am still 's would be inspected. </ I>
Hopefully we can see each other more often.
- I hope so too.
And you let us know
What the doctor finally decided?
Or he further at this school ...
- Yes.
Come on, Ben, walk.
Ben, your camera. You have to look forward.
Really, look forward.
Ben, come.
Ben, this cant go on.
This cant go on no longer.
Questing  </ i> in Silancium
Waiting for you!  XXX Scarlite
Wow  o_O
You are a star on the Internet!!
Hi, my son.
Is it a bit?
Is there something?
Do you want to tell me something?
- No.
You have one message.
From that girl, Scarlite.
When will we see her
in real life?
Or is it not now?
I will let you ... Chat.
Or what you call it.
Sleep tight.
 Why tell people that anyway. </ I>
 Sleep tight. "</ I>
 If you do not rest. </ I>
 But they, they waited. </ I>
For  me. </ I>
 For Me, Ben X. Ben nothing </ i>.
They waited  </ i>.
For  me. </ I>
Scarlite says:
Too late
Never leave a lady waiting
Ben X says: low health
That is not good
Scarlite says: Keep your socks on
Im going  healing </ i>
Ben says:
Too late for  healing </ i>
It's nice weather. Let us got to the 
hospital again, eh, Ben.
Back to the doctor.
 Weather tell my story. </ I>
Dr. Meyvaert will be very glad
to see us.
 What is my story? </ I>
 I was not normal, I was ... Special. </ I>
Thats what  everyone. </ I> said
Your child is just hypersensitive.
Just sensitive.
A few emotionally dysfunctional.
- A mild form of psychosis.
Just a little tense.
Like the mother?
I will give you this.
We can always do
further investigations.
 In-vestigate. Vestigate in what?</ I>
 And there is always a camera. </ I>
 They see it. </ I>
 Who's crazy and who's not. </ I>
It is a waste of time.
Pure waste of time.
You have to face it.
This cant go on no longer.
We need someone to help us.
- That child has nothing wrong.
Nothing, nothing.
I would not lose my mind.
- You will lose nothing but.
 You have to let go, they said. </ I>
 But they dont allow me to go. </ I>
Just follow the new rule.
 And when they suddenly </ i>
 What 't able to be </ i>.
 I simply have a  faulty brain </ i>.
It would be 't Asperger syndrome
Can be.
The  Asperger syndrome, </ i>
 They said. </ I>
A form of autism.
 Autism. This is what she discovered. </ I>
 I have autism. </ I>
Of  autism has given me. </ I>
Twelve years  they have studied a man</ i>.
But not  tought him  </ i>
 to not pick his nose </ i>.
Madam, it  is not easy.
And it will not be easy.
But you should not forget:
Ben is not stupid.
On the contrary, he is very strong.
He is almost genious.
He  talk and talk and talk. </ I>
 The man who helped me far State. </ I>
He is strong in his senses.
We actually have to deal
with an extraordinary boy.
Those fights every day ...
As a normal boy
By the life.
And now the question:
Should we thereof help him?
Of those illusion that he as a habitual
Boy by the life could be.
I have heard that his schoolresults
is good. Very good indeed.
So why should we want
There now address?
Because he is bullied to death,
for example.
Yes well, that happens. That happens.
It would not, but could happen.
At a given moment
You get a stamp.
Autism.
Snap?
But that word ...
For me that was a child
Just that child.
For me it was Ben Ben.
Yes, these are volcanoes.
They are walking volcanoes
You do not know the strength.
Timebombs actually,
They live undercover in our world.
Because the reaction is often
much later than the cause.
We will continue.
Thats the best we can do.
We surely do not let us know.
And when  my fingers has </ i>
 told her everything. </ I>
Ben X says: game over
Time for endgame
Come on.
They , the princess of the letters, </ i>
 On the other side of the country. </ I>
 That always stands beside me </ i>
 As' will last no longer. </ I>
 Those who know me, </ i>without them
 no one would know my name </ i>.
 Those who could meet me rapen </ i>.
They  I could do 'sleep. "</ I>
 The plan of one word. </ I>
 'Let me help you,' she said. </ I>
 'In order to increase ...</ i>
 to rise above yourself. '</ I>
Quietly, Ben. Quietly.
What do you have today?
Got your cell phone?
Call if you need something?
 It is not your heart. </ I>
Give me a kiss.
 Just stay quiet. </ I>
What exactly happened that day?
Who will say it?
I knew only that he ...
Look, I knew
How is my son felt ...
To the way in which he
slammed the door early morning.
It was not even such a bad door.
That, at least I thought.
I , Marsman </ i>.
 I had to ... It </ i>.
 Ob. </ I>
 But which? </ I>
 Because I was always there. </ I>
Always  al </ i>
I's normal.
Freak.
- Mietje.
Have you seen what I shot?
Did you view?
I did not know that you believed.
Is it a little, boy?
You know that you can always tell me
if there is something. Right?
There is nothing.
- Ok.
Goddammit, what is it now?
Do you think its funny?
I thought its funny.
- And do you see me laughing?
Perhaps you have no sense
of humor, sir.
Since you do not start, eh Bogaert.
You guys do a game with me, eh.
And you play with ...
Fire.
- With fire, yes.
And you play with ...
- Fire.
Cant you take a joke?
You have to defend yourself, boy.
You have to guard yourself. Weapons.
 My arms. A death cross. </ I>
In  Archlord pay you </ i>
 350 gold. </ I>
If we just knew,
Them. Did we 't but conscience.
But what had they done?
You see it arrive each year.
You see it arrive every time.
Every evening you sit on your bare knees
And you prays that it may well just pass.
And that is usually the case.
But yes ...
This time, we certainly
skipped a prayer .
You know the outcome.
And we know it now.
I know only that the school
never again will be the same.
Hi. Eh ... Ben X.
I know you are not real,
But I know you very well.
I would only say:
What counts in a game, also counts here.
You can not  endgame </ i> play
Without your  healer </ i>, and that's me. Right?
I am worried about you.
I take the train tomorrow
Arriving at 10.22.
And I know that you will be there.
You have never missed an appointment.
So, until tomorrow.
Hi, Marsman.

The  bus. My bus. </ I>
 My bus - all of which drive away. </ I>
Small is beautiful among the trees.
Here we are on the bench.
Friends among themselves.
You have to relax, said Beard.
And Beard is right.
Hey. What's that?
- What a watch.
You are spoiled.
Not so aggressive.
Not like last time.
You know what it is.

You know what happens then.

We are friends among each other.
Jesus, you are really mad.
Relax.
 Got your cell phone? Call if there is something</ i>.
 Yes, mama. </ I>

You cannot talk,
How can you phone?
What would he do with it?
- SMS  to his mother.
SMS? Look.
Here, you must look.
An MMS ...
Who's that?
Frankenstein has a baby.
- Scarlite.
Shes called Scarlite.
- Let's see.
He has a girlfriend.
Hey, which looks not bad.
- Definitely not.
What counts in a game, also counts here.
You can not  endgame </ i> play
Without your  healer ...</ i>
Your  healer? </ I> ls it your  healer? </ I>
Dealer.
- Incredibly.

True or not?
Telephone, phone, Benny.
They call him too. It's Mommy.
Mommy. Hi, Mommy.
I am in the park with my friends.
Speak your message after the beep.
Hey, Mommy. Oops, voicemail.

Please do not rely on?
It is Mommy, you will recall.
Well?
Come on, Ben. Call back.
Benny Boy.
You are a damn marsman.
We can no longer take this.
And then to remember that we
Had a gift for you.
That we just
Our best friends.
It is a small pill,
But 't have a big impact.
That is why they call Superman.
Open your mouth.
There is a smiley for people
like you who can not laugh. Pull?
A little water to flush.
And then you feel just Superman.
So. And swallow.
The first one is free
Because you are our friend.
Next time you pay.
It will be good for you. Really.
Not so aggressive next time.
Here.
Then you know what time 't as you again
Going to click against that thick.
This is not true.

Mama, what is that?
Nothing, son. Nothing.
Come on, we are going to find your brother.
Goddammit.
Damn.

Where are you?
Ben ...
Feel it.
Feel it, Ben.
You must learn to feel good
You learn to feel good.
What is it, boy? What happened?
Is it?
Do you see yourself.
Is it?
What has happened to you?
It is a good boy, but come.
It is nothing, mama. People say
That always: It's nothing.
I am healed. Really, cured.
Completely healed.
It is good, boy.
- Your big brother is Superman.
Calm, Ben. We go home.
Thats enough.
There is water out of your eyes, mama.
There is really water from your eyes,
But I know that is salt and wet.
Salt and wet.
People say that I do not get
feelings because I do not get it ...
But I could.
I know ...
Do you remember when I was little
I always ...
Back the tears trying to stop.
This was simply because I did not want
you sad.
It is, mama. People say
Always thats it, and then ask them:
Is it?
And then they say: Yes, yes.
Yes, it's good. It is good.
Its going forward. Its going forward.
It is good, you say.
Really, it does.
But I am not crazy.
- No.
I am just a bit difficult.
Yes, difficult, which I am.
But I am used to train, mama.
Really, I am training.
I am broken. But I am reborn,
As in a video game.
There will also give a new life.
- Come on, son. We'll go home. Come on.
 And now it is worked out ...</ i>
 I was. </ I>
 Eyes open again. </ I>
Head  closed again. </ I>
What's that, Ben?
Why did you not tell me that?
 Then came the truth. </ I>
The  zwaarheid. The raarheid </ i>.
Who has done this?
Say, Ben.
 Everything can be destroyed so soon really. </ I>
 Everything can be destroyed so soon </ i>.
 Why could I not also destroy? </ I>
Stop, Ben. Stop.
Jonas, go.
Here. Jonas ...
 And when I saw that dick, that zero </ i>
 There again. </ I>
 And I went to tackle him. </ I>
 I had a lot of thought. </ I>
 The fall of the night. </ I>
 Go to the end of the pain. </ I>
What   blood can be nice </ i>.
 And even later ... Was my father. </ I>
Ben, Ben, son.
 My Dad </ i>.
 He never know what he should say. </ I>
So i usually know how he feels.
 She was also coming </ i>.
 Sabine, his girlfriend, </ i>
 As he said </ i>.
 They always asked whether with me ...</ i>
 Went </ i>.
Is it?
For example, which is no more.
- No, Sabine. For example, that no longer exists, no.
Yet it will be.
It will still need, Sabine.
It is not the first time
And 't will not be the last.
Come, Sabine. It is good.
It is good.
Care for him.
 The endgame </ i>.
The  end, the end, the end, the end. </ I>
 The endgame </ i>.
 In less than thirteen, I will kill you. </ I>
Even  42 down. </ I>
 Then you will be there. Then you are ready. </ I>
Even  42 down. </ I>
 And death is life. </ I>
 You can not play endgame </ i>
 Without your healer, and that's me. </ I>
 I take the train tomorrow </ i>
 At 10.22 hours at which you arrive. </ I>
 And I know that you will be ...</ i>
9.36 pm.
 I have to go to the station. </ I>
I have to go to the station.
 Quietly, quietly, Ben. </ I>
On the road
No worries
Will I  take your phone, Benny Boy? </ I>
 The station ... The station. </ I>
 10.22 hours at the station. </ I>
 So here we go, eh, Desmet? </ I>
 We must see </ i>.
 They can not. Too late. </ I>
 And those who might be there. Those who do not know </ i>
 How I look, who I am. </ I>
 That I am not. And they did. </ I>
 But I knew ...</ i>
 I would find it </ i>.
 I would smell her. </ I>
 If I was the dog. </ I>
 There ... She was </ i>.
She was . </ I>
 Genuine </ i>.
 In real life </ i>.
She waited  </ i>.
For  me. </ I>
And they  sms'ed </ i>.
Probably  to me. </ I>
 And then everything went very quickly, </ i>
 As they say. </ I>
 But everything always goes too fast for me. </ I>
 She went away. </ I>
 Because I was not there. </ I>
 The man who they do not see </ i>.
 But what my head could not, </ i>
 My legs could do. </ I>
 That is the train. </ I>
 A spacecraft that is that our </ i>
 pick up on a barren planet. </ I>
Everything is  dare </ i>.
To  do what you can not do. </ I>
 Her smell was enough. </ I>
 The scent of a spice </ i>
 that still had to be invented. </ I>
A continent  </ i>
 Still to be discovered ...</ i>
 But I could smell already  </ i>
 kilometers of outside the coast  </ i>.
 With her perfect neck to me </ i>
 Saturday they 'n landscape dreams. </ I>
 And I ... I suggested to me how I </ i>
 would plant my lips...</ i>
 As a flag. </ I>
 The flag of my liberation. </ I>
 So just sit here </ i>
 In the warmth of her body. </ I>
 Very even, suddenly perfect. </ I>
The next station is Brussels.
We arrive within ...
Hey, how are you?
Now  time for something. </ I>
 Just say something. </ I>
 But nothing is all I am saying. </ I>
 I only know the lonley way </ i>.
 And she went away. </ I>
Just  gone. </ I>
 And I had also just gone. </ I>
I was really scared.
A mother feels something.
Well hundred times per second, I
Thought: Please Do not stoms.
If he now please
But nothing doms.
I remember well that he 'n once asked:
How many reasons does a man need
to commit suicide?
I said: What?
Yes, that what he said.
Are those two, five, ten?
Since he was doing.
To know whether he is tired.
 The endgame. My plan </ i>.
 The plan of a word. </ I>
 Murder. The murder of myself. </ I>
The train . </ I>
To  nowhere more. </ I>
 There is an advantage to suicide. </ I>
You dont have to seek the 
 victim </ i> very far..
 You do not even attempt to do it. </ I>
 The train had it arranged. </ I>
 What was his motive? </ I>
 A locomotive </ i>.
If you think that it goes quickly ...
That is really not the case.
Even if you have the good fortune
that you are immediately beheaded ...
Then it still that your head have
13 to 15 seconds of consciousness.
You can imagine that youre
not really have nice thoughts.
If you look at the rest of your limbs
flying around.
They say
You just before you die ...
The movie of your life
passes before your eyes.
And? Did it?
But who has ...
- Who has been pushed?
I of course. Who else?
Sufferd.
You?
And he has no notable scars
Or a birthmark or something?
Scars?
That was already destroyed sure?
And did you notice something odd out?
I dont get it, Ben.
Really.
Are you the man from the dungeon  </ i>
Silancium of escaped?
That alone with me the desert
Of Windrill is extended?
Those who fought with Bailor.
With me by the marshes
Of Ondekon is drawn.
Zerdin has reports.
You are 80 level, damn.
And so is your  endgame? </ I>
Stomweg simply
For the train jump.
Was that your plan?
Even a  exit. </ I> A  log out. </ I>
'On the road. No worries. '
Well, it is surely good news?
That is to say that he is just a road
And you do not have to be worried.
My son does not do that,
Just go away on Saturday morning.
Hes not even allowed to leave.
And indeed, look,
I have found this.
It is a perfect day to throw back your head
and kiss it all goodbye
101 ways
to kill yourself
I do not know if you know, Ben ...
In real life ...
Dying is quite final.
You can not imagine.
You may be dying.
But not in real life.
So we should not play, Ben.
You, level 80.
Do you want away from this world, Ben?
Now go away.
But if you want to take revenge, Ben,
Wreek you then.
Because otherwise you just
What they can say. A loser.
Play to win, Ben.
Everything is planning.
Everything is strategy.
Keep your true of Fanta?
I am so happy.
That you you are you.
Well, we shall him nationwide
As missing.
And this?
What are you going to do?
I will contact
With social workers.
They know that only too well.
Too bad.
"I wanted the only way," he said.
'But I dared not as good death
Because I did not know what that was. "
Was that your big plan?
How do we do it?
Are we poison?
No. Imagine that youve taken your
poison and and it in your body.
Then you call 911, poison department.
"Hello?"  "Baaaarf!"
The people there
always get that kind of calls.
That is really something for stomkoppen.
You can also hang yourself.
That is really tough. Then your appearance
is like to obtain an enormous erection.
But you yourself has shitted yourself.
That's not so cool
to be found this way, eh.
You know, Ben, furthermore ...
What they found under the fingernails
someone who has hung?
All small bits of rope and sheet.
And do you know why that is?
That's because they desperately try
to get that rope of their neck
And that succeeds or not. Because the seat
Is too far and they can not.
Ben, you find it exciting, eh?
Dying.
Dying.
Everything is in one time.
Ben is in one time.
Would you do not have to look one time
See if there is a different solution?
Not even one time around.
You should damn it
be a little more creative, Ben.
Obligation and beauty.
You are so beautiful.
 A guild together, she said. </ I>
 As Archlord </ i>.
 It was her idea. There are quests </ i>
 Which are too large for two. </ I>
'You must help me,' he said.
And we have helped him.
We knew that everybody would say:
There is nothing you can do.
But that is more or less
what i have done.
You may not smoke, Sabrina.
- It is' Sabine '.
You should be thankful
That you should not smoke.
Yes, I am incredibly grateful.
Another half-day to live longer.
That does not really believe you.
That does not really go?
You see it yourself that this is not possible.
I cannot.
Sabine, you have absolutely nothing.
You wanted the necessarily account.
I made no difference.
But if you think that its us
Easy, you have it wrong.
Watch.
The sea.
The end of the world.
And you know what they say, eh Ben?
Each end is a beginning.
Does someone want something to eat? Ben?
Sabine?
- No, please do not.
Dont you feel good, Sabine?
- Not really, no.
Ben, are you sure?
Is this what you want?
Good.
Ben ... I would ...
 I have me ... Committed </ i>.
 Everything is thought </ i>.
 And for thinking </ i>.
 Everything is willpower. </ I>
Everything is  dare </ i>.
Eventually  still do </ i>
 What you cannot do. </ I>
 If you die in a game, </ i>
 You are just gone. </ I>
 And you have to give your own body </ i>
 Back to searching. </ I>
 The only thing they took from me, </ i>
 Was a tape. </ I>
 And I ... I was gone. </ I>
 These are particularly poignant images </ i>
 Who remind us ...</ i>
 That every week a young Flemish </ i>
 takes his life </ i>.
 According to recent studies, 10 percent </ i>
 of all Flemish youth ...</ i>
 Ever indicate a suicide thought. </ i>
 A very frightening figure. </ I>
 Sport then.  At the tournament ...</ i>
Dear attendees.
Dear family ...
Ladies and gentlemen ...
Ladies and gentlemen,
Girls and boys.
We are meeting here this afternoon
To say farewell to ...
Of a very special young man.
Who we miss
And very tragically ...
..has died.
Ben has never been easy.
With the condition that he had - 
It has made his life difficult.
Perhaps we realize now,
Too late then ...
that he struggled with this disability,
We will say.
And that this was worse
than we can think.
Because there is never
a real contact.
And now even more will be.
We can today only
Accept ...
That some things simply
too heavy to bear.
Therefore family ...
Hello.
Thank you for coming.
I also died,
As they say.
dead to myself.
Best to-people and fellows ...
My fight has stopped.
At the end of your life you see the movie
of your life as well, they say.
Here are a few scenes
Which you may find interesting.
Ben, come on. Now.  The endgame </ i>.
 Creative death, they called it. </ I>
Suicide  without the murder. </ I>
Dying without  a way to go </ i>
 Or leave without death. </ I>
 I have everything to learn. </ I>
But the main  </ i>
 I was forgotten. </ I>
 Learning lie </ i>.
 Faking </ i>.
There was a death first.
Otherwise you were probably not show up.
For a boy
Simply bullied.
And at a certain point, you can not
Continue to cry out and ask ...
Mama, as evil.
And even 's questions whether now please
Anything can happen.
That finally would stop.
That they would finally stop
bullying my son.
And his life as ...
Sorry, but it was really true.
His life as impossible.
His autism is his problem,
But for him it's no problem.
They are the others.
That is the problem. Others.
They have to learn my small
Alone casting.
Ben simply wanted to go.
Now he's gone.
And fortunately he was still alive.
He lives.
In his own world, perhaps,
But he still lives. He still lives.
His life.
Let it happen, Ben.
Do not be afraid.
If you want to feel good,
You have to learn to feel good.
Caress him.
 I have never been happy. </ I>
 But I have never been so</ i>
 Happy. </ I>
Nice, eh.
Animals do not have to talk.
Are you not allowed to mount?
Held on socks.
There is always something ... People see
A horse and want out.
But these animals have
There is not asked?
Do you not?
Because if you can choose to only ...
Oh yes ...
