Sir, can I help you?
Sir, this is a very beautiful piece.
Would you like a cigarette?
If you want a bullet hole in your body
then stay standing.
Well, why aren't you
behaving yourselves?
Hey...
where are the gold Buddhas?
Open the safe.
Still a peeping Tom at your age?
Hey, what colour is it? Well?
I couldn't see it.
- What are you staring at?
- I'm staring at you two.
Hey! You aren't allowed to park here.
Move your car now!
Here you go.
I'm in charge of security here.
The toilet is already dirty,
don't make it dirtier.
Leave us alone!
Miss Susy, this is only hush money.
We're almost done.
Making love is a holy act. Go find a bed.
Put your trousers back on!
Gou Fei, I have your brother Sam Sei.
Whether he lives or dies
depends on your ability to find
the money to pay his ransom.
Gou Fei.
You value him, then.
- How much money does he owe you?
- Very little.
- About $30,000.
- Give me face, big brother.
- When I get the money, I'll pay you back.
- You don't have it?
We have it.
I promise to get it to you in 15 days.
15 days? I'll send you to hell!
Hey, don't hit him!
- Are you telling me what to do?
- Gou Fei, it's OK. I'm still alive. I'm fine.
I'll give you face.
- Chop his hand off!
- Don't chop my hand off...
They're getting their gear!
Give it to me!
Do you think I'm useless?
I said don't hit him.
- Sam Sei, let's go!
- I'll pay you back.
- Come on!
- I'll definitely pay you back.
Don't bother! Even if you get the money,
you won't be alive to pay me.
You'd better run as far as you can.
Don't let me find you!
Let's go.
What? What?
In that much trouble?
- Mona.
- What?
- Go now!
- What happened?
Brother Fei beat up Loan Shark Hung.
Go. Hurry up.
Go out the back door.
Sam Sei! Get on the bike!
We can't escape. All of Bangkok
is controlled by Loan Shark Hung!
We should just kill him
then it'll all be fine!
Even if you can kill him, you think you're
capable of destroying his organisation?
I have a few thousand dollars.
Use it as interest payment.
It's useless.
They want our lives, not money.
What? As if he wouldn't take the money
if we gave it to him!
Money? He's got loads!
He needs to gain face somehow.
- Don't worry. I have a plan.
- What is it?
Robbery?
Do you mean robbery?
Yes. If we pull this off, we'll make a lot of
money then we can go where we want.
Hey, don't even think of it.
It's too dangerous.
I don't think so. It's a good idea.
Are you mad? Don't even think of it!
We're in enough trouble.
What can we do? We're in deep shit!
If you knew it'd land us in deep shit,
why borrow the money?
Brother Fei!
Don't worry.
We'll figure out what to do
when the time comes.
I wasn't worried.
I've got confidence in you.
I know you'll be able to deal with it.
Let me...
In the next few days, take my mother's
ashes back to Hong Kong,
and bury them with my father's.
Let them meet their future
daughter-in-law.
What about you?
After I finish off some things,
I'll go to Hong Kong and bring you back.
Why don't I wait for you
and we'll go back together?
Why? Are you feeling shy?
Even an ugly woman has to meet
her in-laws at some point.
Am I ugly?
Small head, big feet,
do you think you're ugly?
I'd better not go. We're not married yet.
I don't want your father to ignore me.
Hey! What are you doing? Ouch!
Hey, don't! It hurts!
Let go, you! Let go! Ow!
This mark made by my teeth is even
more valid than a marriage certificate.
I don't think it's a good idea.
I'll wait for you
so we can go back together.
You don't even have enough money
to buy a ticket.
I can't leave Chung and Sam Sei behind.
Unless you have some money
secretly tucked away.
Actually, it was wrong of you
to blame Sam Sei.
He borrowed the money
from Loan Shark Hung
because he wanted to have
a nice funeral for your mother.
Well? Are you still
talking about robbery?
No.
If you've got a plan, tell me about it.
Nothing...
I have a cousin from Hong Kong
who's come here to make a living.
He wants us to join him
on a path to wealth.
- Set up a meeting.
- OK.
It's flesh! It hurts!
How dare you?
- Enough!
- Let's have some more fun!
- No!
- Just a bit more!
You're crazy! I'm letting you do it!
Why act like it's rape?
- Come here!
- Get away from me!
I'm going to beat you up! Ouch! Don't...
Hi, Sister Ngang.
Exercising this early?
Let me introduce to you Gou Fei.
- Gou Fei, Sister Ngang.
- There's no need for introductions.
Work with this bitch and bastard?
Let's leave!
Hold it!
Be more polite!
- Don't fight!
- You're pulling moves on me?
Stop fighting! Stop!
Stop fighting! We're on the same side!
- Hey! Stop...
- Take your time...
Stop fighting!
Hey, how come your mouth stinks?
I haven't kissed you,
how do you know it stinks?
Ah...
Don't mind me! Beat him up!
Beat him up!
Stop it! You're going to kill him!
What's with you? It was a mistake
getting to know you! You're useless!
Fucker! You're trying to beat me up!
Gou Fei, he's one of us.
Your eyes are mesmerising.
Yes, you both have mesmerising eyes.
We're on the same side.
We all want to get rich.
If we work together, we'll do well.
Yes, we'll do well. It'll be easy.
Hm... Come over here and talk business.
When you get the military arms,
I'll give you $20 million,
but on one condition,
you kill Gou Fei for me.
Group members
from Hong Kong, follow me.
This is north. The military truck
will go around in a big loop here,
pass through Patong Street
then go over the bridge and south.
This is the Chang Wang Bridge.
Gou Fei, you and Lau Ngang
sit in front and distract everyone.
Sam Sei and I will be in the back.
Chung, you and Psycho will be
in charge of hijacking the truck.
- Any suggestions?
- I'll be in the car with Chung.
Why?
Are you afraid I'll eat you?
Think you're too good for her?
Want to choose your own partner?
- You think this is a game?
- This is work! You want another fight?
- What are you saying?
- What are YOU saying?
- You fight every time you disagree!
- Sit down.
We're trying to make a living here!
If no one has other ideas,
why don't we go with my plan?
You were flirting with her.
How are things?
- Stay calm.
- What?
I'm not scared. I'm hot.
I was in China and I saw your mother.
She said you haven't even
written her one letter.
I don't have two pennies to rub together.
What's the point of writing?
I told you to work with me from the start.
Look! I'm well dressed,
but you're a mess.
You look like a beggar!
Hey!
I've been pumping and grinding all day.
Check if my underpants
have worn through or not.
No. I can only see that you're very wet.
Hey, you're not reacting!
How long has it been
since you've had a woman?
Today.
I knew you were a stud.
After this job, why don't we have
a friendly get together?
- I don't know how to play ball.
- No way...
- Hey!
- What?
Haven't you taken
enough advantage of me?
No!
I'm going to come!
- Have you stared enough?
- So what if I'm staring at you?
- Do you want a fight?
- I'm not afraid of you!
- Master Judge, the truck is coming!
- Of course the truck's coming.
Get out!
- Get out!
- We're working!
Lt'll only take three seconds to kill you!
Scared?
Come on!
- What do we do?
- Psycho! What are you two doing?
The truck is here.
Get back in the vehicle now!
Hey! Time to go to work!
I'm working now,
I haven't even orgasmed yet.
- Get ready.
- Ready.
OK, got it.
Are you done getting off yet?
I'm almost there.
Calm down. Gou Fei, I love ya.
I want you!
Bitch, do you want to die?
You jerks, don't you have
any desire to treat a lady well?
Get in!
- What happened?
- The asshole kicked me off the truck!
Get in the car!
It's him!
- Don't!
- Don't get in the way!
Chung! Chung!
Why did you try to kill Gou Fei?
- Why did you kill Chung?
- Shut up!
Why did you betray us?
- Why?
- Shut up!
Judge, you can't get away!
I'll get you no matter what!
- I'm so scared. Give it your best shot.
- Master Judge, don't kill Gou Fei!
I don't want any of the money,
I'll give you my share of the cargo!
If you think you're ready to die, drive on.
Chung, I won't let you die in vain.
- Crash into them!
- Dodgems are fun!
Get out of here!
Don't fight in front of my door! Go on!
Leave now!
Run!
Little girl!
- I hate messing up my hair!
- Are you OK?
I'm fine.
Cousin, are you one of us?
If you are then go in there
and kill him for me!
The fucker is dead meat.
If you're not going in then die with him!
Walk!
Gou Fei...
it's Sam Sei.
I'm coming in, don't shoot me...
You betrayed me, Sam Sei! Why?
No, it's not my fault.
Brother Fei, I have no choice.
I only have two paths I can take.
Either you die... or I die.
I'm very scared!
- Give me the gun.
- Don't...
I know you're really scared,
are you going to sacrifice a friend
just because you're scared?
Give me the gun.
We can still make a run for it together.
Give me the gun.
Vicious Hong Kong criminals
are committing crimes in Thailand
Suspected link to deaths of
youth and criminal by fire
Alone
The body is like a shell without a soul
Feeling sad
Even when feeling desolate
and dejected, one still must move on
Who's willing to be drunk
past midnight?
These violent emotions
accuse me of hatred
In life
I just want to meet someone
who will be with me
I haven't given up
Be patient, I'm still not ready
I have never given up
Don't be a servant to fate
How can I
Pretend I don't care?
Oh-oh oh
I want to create a big stir in the world
Traps stop me from moving forward
I stop abruptly
But the storm approaches quickly
I'm used to it
I walk alone
Things that happened in the past
I have no means to question them
I give up thinking about the reasons
There is no sincerity anywhere
Calculating manipulators
are everywhere
This world has gone crazy
Crazy
Hot like fire!
My weapons will match
whatever Judge can supply
and the price will be cheaper than his!
Kau, doing business is like shitting,
it's important to have
a smooth operating mechanism.
Hey, don't worry.
I won't get you constipated!
How long has Judge been around?
- Go!
- Hey, what are you doing?
Everybody get down!
Freeze!
Sit down!
Hey, Sam Sei!
What do you mean by this?
What are you doing?
Haven't you ever heard
a gunshot before?
Sit down.
Pretend like nothing's happened!
Sit down! Lie down!
Just like this?
We're close to each other!
Bitch! Are you on expired uppers,
moaning so loudly!
Loan Shark Hung, it's better if you leave.
No problem.
This has nothing to do with me.
It's best to settle things peacefully.
Hak, let's go.
Judge wants to see you.
Did you hear that?
Someone wants to take your boss away.
Sam Sei, I didn't know
you knew how to use a gun.
Judge didn't misjudge you at all!
You think your holding
a crummy gun is scaring me?
You've got a problem with my gun?
Do you want to experience rebirth?!
Sit down!
Don't! Don't!
Get out!
Get in!
Good.
You're taking so long.
You're moving that piece?
You're a goner.
Sam Sei.
Sam Sei!
Hey, Chow Sang!
It's your turn to experience what
it feels like to be shot by a friend.
Sam Sei.
Sam Sei!
Hey! What happened?
I saw Gou Fei.
Brother Sei.
Don't come up behind me like that!
You scared me.
You have a call.
Hello.
Gou Fei. If you want revenge
then just kill me in one shot!
Don't play around.
OK, I'll be right there.
Gou Fei.
I don't care if you're alive or a ghost,
I know I owe you.
If you want to kill me then go ahead.
I won't fight back.
If I wanted to kill you, do you think you'd
still be standing here talking to me?
What do you want then?
Are you willing
to help me once in return?
If you're willing to give me a chance
then I'll definitely help you.
I need some money.
- How do you want me to help?
- I'll let you know.
- Does he know about our relationship?
- Huh?
I don't know if he does or not.
Then did he ask about me?
No.
Why did you tell me Gou Fei died?
I really thought he was dead.
Do you think I was lying?
When have I lied to you?
Because he's back,
you can't trust me any more?
Are you really afraid
he'll find out about us?
Do you really want him
to ask about you?
No.
No? Then what do you want?
Why do you care so much
whether he asked about you or not?
You can go back to him.
What is it with you?
Why are you so upset?
I'm just asking about my ex!
Fine. How come you're not concerned
about me, then? Ask about me!
Do you care about me?
I was almost drowned by him today!
What do you mean I didn't ask?
Do you want to talk about it?
I really want to know why.
You and Gou Fei are such good friends
but he shot at you.
Are you hiding something from me?
- Well?
- No.
No!
It's still late at night, looking out
the window upon the silent horizon
Asking the night
how would it know how the heart feels
As time passes, the bottomless love
hidden in the heart
Like glacial winds the way one looks
at things is now lacking in direction
Like gently shifting sand dunes
it again conceals sadness
What are you barking about?
Did you see me kill him?
I wish I could too. But I can't do it.
It's easy being you -
you bark when you're hungry,
you pooh when you're full.
It's much more complicated
being a person.
Come on, have some breakfast.
Thank you for putting my mother
and father's graves together.
You're welcome.
I want to know
where Judge keeps his arms.
That means you want me
to betray Judge.
You betrayed me once.
I was gutless before.
I made that mistake once,
I won't make the same mistake again.
An improvement.
I'll take you to see someone.
Why did you kidnap me?
Did you know Judge absconded with
the arms that day to trade with him?
With the condition
that he kill all three of us brothers.
Tell him what was what.
Is that true Loan Shark Hung?
- If you had the guts to do it, admit it!
- Yeah, so blow me!
You're lucky!
I wasn't able to kill you last time!
I've always been lucky. Didn't you know?
You were really lucky to have such a
good cousin to look after your interests.
But Chung was unlucky.
You should remember
you had a good friend called Chung.
Come on. Come on!
As if you could do it! Fuck off!
I don't know where the arms are.
Once I find out I'll let you know.
Judge still thinks of you as an outsider.
Check and see if Lau Ngang
knows or not.
Mona wants to see you.
I'm working,
don't talk to me about personal stuff.
I'll get in touch.
Why are you drinking so heavily?
I'm sexually frustrated.
What do you mean by that?
Why are you throwing a fit?
Me throwing a fit?
Why do you think?
We used to have sex seven times a day,
whenever, however.
Nowadays? Even when I'm begging you,
we don't do it once in seven days!
- Hi, Psycho. How are you?
- Hey, Julianne. Long time no see.
- Your breasts have got so much bigger!
- Hey, listen to you!
I'm going for a piss.
Sister Ngang,
why are you drinking so heavily?
I said I'm sexually frustrated!
Where's Psycho?
The impotent retard has gone
to the bathroom to get a blow job!
Hey, why don't we leave?
Why leave so soon?
Let's stay a while longer.
Are you rushing home to shag?
Are you doing it seven times a day?
No, I have to rehearse tomorrow.
- I'll go now, you stay with her.
- OK.
I'm leaving now, Sister Ngang.
- Come on!
- What?
Are you afraid I'm going to eat you?
What is wrong with you?
- Don't mind him. Let's go for a drive.
- How dare you bump into me!
- Here!
- Where?
- Who the hell was that?
- You're A-OK!
Hey, come on!
What are you doing?
So you're finally willing
to show your face?
See who it was! It hurts! It hurts here.
She... That girl really looks like
your girlfriend.
Gou Fei!
Gou Fei!
Why are you avoiding me?
I don't want to see you.
If you don't want to see me then why are
you following me around all the time?
I shouldn't have shown my face.
I'm sorry.
If you weren't dead,
why didn't you come back for me?
Great.
New location and it's quiet.
Sam Sei, I don't think
you have the guts for it.
I'm warning you, don't accuse me
of being gutless again.
You really think I don't dare fuck you?
If Psycho found out,
what do you think he'd do?
Are you planning to give him a report?
There's no fun in it
if we can only do it secretly from now on.
Then all our feelings will disappear.
Bad boy.
Want to try it again?
It's really you who cares about me.
What are you talking about?
Bullshit. Your cousin Judge
treats you well.
You're joking! If I weren't his cousin,
he'd have left me behind a long time ago.
I wouldn't be here talking to you now.
If he treated me well, he wouldn't have
kept the arms deal a secret.
Everyone knows about it -
you and Psycho know about it,
I'm the only one in the dark.
Wouldn't it be great if we had money?
- You're want some money?
- Who doesn't?
If we had money then we'd be perfect.
Bastard.
Good job! You managed to sweet talk
Lau Ngang in such a short time.
I didn't have to sweet talk her.
She just told me all about it.
Gou Fei...
where did you go with Mona that night?
Why don't you ask her?
Since she got back,
she doesn't seem happy.
Mona is yours. Whether she's happy
or not is between you two.
I'm leaving once this is done.
- Where's the stuff?
- Lau Ngang said it was inside the ice.
We don't know how many there are.
Don't shoot unless you have to.
Spade!
Hey!
- What do you want?
- I'm here for the merchandise.
- What merchandise?
- Judge's merchandise.
Get out!
- Where's the merchandise?
- I don't know.
- Do you know now?
- I don't know.
My hand!
You're quite frisky!
- Where's the merchandise?
- It's all on the boat.
- Where's the boat now?
- It's at the pier.
Hey!
- They're on the boat.
- OK.
Wow! This is damn high!
I never thought we'd finally be able to
pull something off like this together.
Just thinking about
that bitch makes me ill.
Her breath smells like a ditch.
She just opened her mouth
and kept on yelling, "Ah! Ah!"
I really couldn't stand her.
But it was worth it.
It was worth it.
It wasn't for nothing.
Well? Haven't you got any news yet?
Fine!
- We still don't know who did it!
- Fucker! Pulling a stunt like this?!
Don't worry. We'll find out who did it.
Judge! Someone's staring at you.
Perrier, please.
He looks familiar.
He's not a ghost, is he?
- Didn't you die already?
- I missed you too.
Your eyes are still mesmerising.
Thanks.
Did you take my merchandise?
Yes.
I even killed a few of your men.
So it was you.
- You asshole!
- Everyone, fall back!
You dare hit me! I'm going to kill you,
fucker! Let go of me!
Psycho! Stop!
You always go against what I want.
Let's make a fair deal.
Can you hold a gun?
Try me.
The money was meant to be split
five ways. $2 million for you is fair.
It's not $2 million. It's $10 million.
Money for the dead?
Don't you want your merchandise?
You're breaking my heart.
I'll give you $10 million.
Where's the merchandise?
I'll get in touch with you.
I regret not screwing your girl.
- That mistake led me to this pitiful state.
- What are you talking about?
Sam Sei says she sucks in bed.
- And that her breath stinks!
- You bastard!
- What did you do with Sam Sei?
- I'm right here! What could I have done?
- Where did you go last night?
- Where did YOU go last night?
Did you sleep with Sam Sei?
And have you slept
with another woman?
Bitch! How dare you talk back to me!
Don't you dare hit me!
I won't hold myself back!
Find Sam Sei for me.
Why haven't you made a move on it?!
Why haven't you moved?
- Hello.
- It's Gou Fei.
What's up?
Nothing. I wanted to tell you
that I just spoke with Judge.
What? You spoke to Judge?
- He'll suspect me! I'll be in deep shit.
- Yes, it's going to be messy.
That's why I called you,
to tell you to pack up.
You bastard! You framed me!
Pack your bags now or it'll be too late.
- Here.
- Why are you so late?
How do you know Sam Sei
is going to show up here today?
- Why did you betray me?
- What?
We're on the same side.
Your actions make it very difficult for me.
That means you don't believe me.
- As you said, we're all on the same side.
- You told Sam Sei where it was.
If you don't admit to it,
you're just insulting my intelligence.
This way.
Even he knows about
you and Sam Sei's affair.
What would you like to drink?
- Mineral water.
- OK.
Judge wants to see you.
Freeze!
Stay back!
Put your hand on my shoulder
and walk in slowly.
I want you to die painfully
for screwing my woman.
I'm so scared.
Let's see who moves faster.
Don't follow us, all right?
Mona, stop dancing! Time to go!
Bastard! You played me!
Freeze, bitch!
Stay here!
- What's going on?
- Be quiet.
Keep an eye on it.
Make sure no one calls the cops.
Thanks.
- This way.
- What's going on?
You want to leave?
- He deserves a beating.
- Come on!
- Hey, Psycho!
- Out of my way!
Don't try anything with me!
Bastard!
You messed around with my woman!
Sam Sei!
Run!
- Run!
- Over there!
- What's going on?
- It's dangerous in here!
- Why haven't you come over here yet?
- Gou Fei, you played me!
Sam Sei! Sam Sei!
- Kit!
- Kit!
Gou Fei, be careful!
If you don't want the merchandise
then fire away.
That asshole.
Judge! Don't shoot!
We've plenty of time.
Let Lau Ngang go then you all can go!
Mona!
Help Sam Sei leave!
Whore, take a seat.
- Are you OK?
- I'm still alive.
Even though Psycho sleeps around,
he still treats you with respect.
We're all on the same side.
If something's wrong, we can always
discuss it. Unity is power.
Why did you betray us?
You admit to it now, bitch?
Judge! Don't!
She was even cheaper
than my merchandise.
I did so much for you but all you want
to do is bring harm to me!
I don't need you to take care of me!
If Gou Fei wanted to cause you harm,
he wouldn't have come back for you.
He didn't come back for me but for you!
Take it easy.
I didn't come back to fight over a girl.
Judge would have figured out
you were helping me.
- That's why I told you to leave.
- What happened between you two?
What is it?
I know you're still mad that I shot you.
Don't talk about it.
I still think of you as a friend
up to this point.
You shot Gou Fei?
But you're a failure as a human being.
What's the difference
between you and Judge?
You betrayed your friend.
You have no morals!
We're thieves,
we can't complain if we die!
That day in Thailand,
an innocent family died for no reason.
A little girl's face was disfigured by
the fire. Did you know that?
I didn't want that to happen!
It wasn't my fault!
By standing with them,
you were an accomplice!
But I was afraid!
Afraid?
That's a reasonable reaction
but that doesn't count.
You work in a dangerous business.
The bitch betrayed me today!
She would have betrayed you tomorrow!
She and Sam Sei weren't one of us!
We were together for so long!
I can't help having feelings for her!
What are you doing?
You can't even manage a woman
like that? And you call yourself a man?
Get out.
Hurry up!
Get out!
You have to be ruthless to be
successful. This world is crazy!
Being sentimental will get you killed.
If you want to survive
then you have to be crazy enough!
Then you'll have a chance.
If you want to blame someone,
blame Sam Sei and Gou Fei.
Hold on.
Don't worry. He should be fine.
Thank you for taking care of me
for so long
but I really can't stay with you any more.
- Take care of yourself.
- Mona!
Mona!
Gou Fei, don't let her go home.
It's too dangerous.
Mona, where are you going?
Sam Sei really needs you right now.
I can't be with someone
who shot my man.
Even if we can't be together,
we can still be friends.
Do you really think that's possible?
Are you angry with me?
I'm very angry with you.
What have I done
for you to treat me like this?
- Is it because I was with Sam Sei?
- Please stay.
Are you asking on Sam Sei's behalf?
I'm going to decide
who I want to be with.
Just because I'm not with you
doesn't mean I have to be with Sam Sei.
Mona.
- Where's Mona?
- She left.
Why didn't you ask her to stay?
Why should she listen to me?
- I can't sleep from thinking about you.
- Me neither.
But I'm thinking of $10 million.
Where should we sneak off to?
OK.
I'll wait for you.
I didn't realise your voice
would be so sexy even on the phone.
Then wash your ass and wait for me.
It's time to stop.
It won't be easy to get the money.
Even if you do get it, you won't stay alive
long enough to enjoy it.
Don't mistake my intentions.
The money is for the little girl.
I did wrong last time.
Give me a chance to redeem myself.
I'd like that too.
You made a mistake once
but even if you do right many times after,
it won't make up for it.
The dead can't return to life.
You and I will never have
peace of mind.
Let me go with you.
There's no need.
Take care of him for me.
I'm sorry, Gou Fei.
Where's the merchandise?
- Where's your boss?
- He's busy.
The money's here.
Let's do the exchange now.
You're not qualified to talk to me.
Ask Judge to come out to see me.
If it wasn't for the merchandise,
I would kill you!
You want the merchandise?
I'll give it to you!
Your aim is good
but mine's even better.
I ruined your right hand
so you trained your left hand.
Now that I've broken your left hand,
why don't you train your feet, stupid!
Where's the merchandise?
Your merchandise is here!
Your right hand's aim is a bit off.
Actually, I adore you the most.
My biggest regret is that
I can't spend a night with you.
My biggest regret is
that I couldn't kill you.
Then you'll definitely be disappointed.
We don't know
who's going to die first yet.
You think your knife
will be faster than my gun?
You're so cruel.
Even though we're not married,
I want you to embrace death with me.
Then go masturbate in hell!
In life
I just want to meet someone who will
become my partner and be with me
I haven't given up
Be patient, I'm still not ready
I have never given up
Don't be a servant to fate
How can I
Pretend I don't care?
Oh-oh oh
I want to create a big stir in the world
Traps stop me from moving forward
I stop abruptly
But the storm approaches quickly
I'm used to it
I walk alone
Things that happened in the past
I have no means to question them
I give up thinking about the reasons
There is no sincerity anywhere
Calculating manipulators
are everywhere
This world has gone crazy
Crazy
I want to create a big stir in the world
Traps stop me from moving forward...
