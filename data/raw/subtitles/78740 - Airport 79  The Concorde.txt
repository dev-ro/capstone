More coffee?
He says, "Not with my wife you don't."
Whose wife?
I thought it was his sister.
That's the point.
- May I have another coffee, please?
- I'll help you.
- Where do you hear these stories?
- If you really want to know...
Yes. Does someone write your material?
Or do you make them up?
I was surprised to see your name
on the crew list this morning.
Life is full of surprises.
- You still take it black?
- Mm-hm.
I heard you retired.
For a short time. I've changed my mind.
I'm glad you did.
Is there anything else you need, Captain?
Le Nouveau Monde...
It is still amazing to me. Only three hours
and a half ago, we were in Paris.
The world seems so small.
Thank you, Dulles.
They want us to park on 23.
There'll be a ceremony when Federation
takes ownership of the plane.
We'll be right there.
Concorde Flight 28, you're clear for landing.
Roger, Dulles.
Holy Christ.
What is over the runways, Dulles?
Nom de Dieu, Paul. Regardel.
- Full power. Go around. Gear up!
- Gear up.
My God, what's happened?
The three balloonists, two men and a woman...
...members of radical
environmentalist group Airpeace...
...surrendered to Virginia State Police.
The Concorde Flight 28
was en route from Paris.
The airplane was purchased
by Federation World Airlines...
...making it America's first
supersonic commercial carrier.
An airline spokesman said today's incident
would not change plans.
...to make a pre-Olympic goodwill flight
to Moscow on the Concorde tomorrow.
In other news, Harrison Industries today
unveiled its highly secret Buzzard project.
Science editor Jeffrey Marks
was at the Maryland test facility.
...for this special report.
Since 1974, Harrison Industries
has been developing for the Air Force.
...the Buzzard attack drone...
...the newest weapon
in the United States arsenal.
A radio-controlled unmanned target plane
is being sent out over the ocean.
Conceived of by Dr Kevin Harrison,
chairman of Harrison Industries...
...the Buzzard was designed by
Harrison's designer, Willie Halpern.
Capable of speeds that exceed
twice the speed of sound...
...the attack drone has an interception range
of over 1,000 miles.
...and a hitherto unheard-of rate
of successful kills close to 100%.
Guided by television cameras
set into its nose.
...and an on-board computer system...
...the Buzzard shows its muscle.
Once locked to its prey, the super-fast bird
electronically homes in on its target.
At Harrison Industries' test facility,
this is Jeffrey Marks for Nightly News.
Testing of the drone will continue at the facility
at daybreak tomorrow.
The prestigious
United States Science Foundation.
...has named Dr Kevin Harrison
as their Man of the Year.
...for his achievements
in advancing aerospace technology.
Dr Harrison, 43, chairman
of the conglomerate Harrison Industries...
...graduated from Harvard
with a doctorate in physics.
Dr Harrison lives in Washington
with his wife and three children.
Members of the Russian Olympic team
concluded a week-long tour.
...at the Cole Field House
at the University of Maryland.
As a continuing feature leading
to our coverage of the 22nd Olympiad...
Robert Palmer gives us this look
at these fine athletes.
Sport has always been
a tapestry of contrasts...
...a never-ending variety of movement.
The epitome of grace, Alicia Rogov...
was the all-round women's gymnastics
gold-medal winner.
...in Munich and Montreal.
She'll be trying for an unprecedented
third gold medal in Moscow.
Just another facet of the 22nd Olympiad.
This is Robert Palmer for Nightly News.
Could I interview you for American television?
Are you crazy? What are you doing here?
My viewers want the story,
up close and personal.
- I will scream if you don't leave!
- I'll just ask a few questions.
How does it feel to be a national hero?
Look into the camera.
We're talking today
with Miss Alicia Rogov...
Thanks.
Come on, American. Interview me.
All right, Miss Rogov.
Why is it so important for you
to win three gold medals?
You're 24. That's old for competition.
Old?
I want to show everyone.
...you don't have to be 15
with a figure like boy to win gold medal.
Anything else, Mister Reporter?
What happened to the shy woman
I met four years ago in Montreal?
She grew up... And fell in love.
Nelli!
Alicia!
Please, very soon
the bus is leaving for the hotel.
What? Something amuses you?
The bubbles. They tickle in strange places.
I want you to put all your strange places
into nice dry clothes.
Now.
She's gone, Robert.
Robert?
Robert Palmer!
Thanks for the interview.
Come back here, Robert Palmer.
- Thanks, Walter.
- Any time, Joe.
I won't, Paul.
I know. Just friends.
You don't know how much you hurt me
when you left.
- I never wanted to hurt you.
- It doesn't take very much.
Isabelle, can I tell you
something very personal?
Mm-hm.
Your hair is in my French fries.
I won't let you hurt me again.
Hold on, I'm coming.
I'm coming!
Who is it?
Miss Whelan? My name is Carl Parker.
I'm the assistant sales director
for Harrison Industries.
We met at an open house
for the World Hunger Council.
I need your help.
I... I'm sorry. I would have called
but your number's not listed.
- That's all right. Come in.
- Well, I... I only have a minute.
Miss Whelan, you're an important person.
You have influence. They'll listen to you.
I don't understand. What is the problem?
I have information that Harrison Industries,
through their overseas operations...
...have been making illegal sales of arms
for the last 15 years.
Harrison Industries?
Weapons were sold to the North Vietnamese...
- weapons that killed a lot of our men.
- That's ridiculous.
No. They've secretly sold arms to Cuba,
to Syria and Uganda.
- Arsenals to terrorist groups...
- Can you prove any of this?
I have documents that detail the sales.
I've locked them away.
I gave my wife the key.
She'll deliver them to you tomorrow morning.
I'm leaving for Paris in the morning.
If these documents exist,
let's see them now.
No, they're looking for me.
I... I have to leave town.
- I'll go and get changed.
- You don't understand.
Mr Parker?
Hello? Hello? Hello, operator?
Help! Help!
Please, somebody! Help me!
Help, someone, please!
Help me, please!
Please help me!
Help me, please!
Captain Metrand?
- Captain Metrand? Joe Patroni.
- Oh.
- I'm gonna be flying with you.
- I'm sorry. I went to bed early.
Oh, I didn't mean to disturb you.
We'll talk tomorrow.
Goodnight to you too, honey!
I've heard a lot about you, Captain,
so I knew that terrific perfume wasn't yours.
Oh.
Carl was a friend of mine.
He worked for me for almost 20 years.
This is unbelievable.
I was standing right next to him.
One minute he was talking to me, then...
Oh, God, it was horrible.
Kevin, he said there were documents.
Documents proving that Harrison Industries
has been making illegal arms sales.
You would have to approve those sales.
Documents?
What did Carl think he was doing?
Somebody in my organisation
must be trying to blackmail me.
I can't understand how Carl got involved.
He seemed like a decent man.
Why would your own people
want to blackmail you?
Because big business is like that kids' game,
king of the mountain.
Somebody always wants
to knock you on your ass.
So, you never made illegal arms sales?
Maggie, I'm a very rich man.
I have everything in life I could ever want.
Why would I jeopardise that
by doing something so incredibly stupid?
Blow your nose.
Sweet Maggie.
Sweet, sweet Maggie.
I love you so much.
You're cold.
Yeah.
- Good morning, Willie.
- Good morning, KH.
You look like you haven't slept.
My grandchild is staying with us.
She slept in the same bed with us all night.
My three kids used to climb in with us.
It was like a disco on Saturday night.
Carl Parker is dead.
- Did we get the documents back?
- No.
And there's somebody else involved.
Maggie Whelan knows about them.
What time is the drone test scheduled for?
6.30. A little over an hour from now.
I want it delayed until eight o'clock.
We've been together a long time, haven't we?
22 years.
Almost half my life.
This could destroy
everything we've worked for.
I need your help, Willie.
How difficult would it be
to reprogram the drone?
No problem at all.
- Where did you get your training?
- Armee de I'Air.
Early on I was flying cargo to Saigon
during the war we had in Indochina.
Then I flew a Mirage.
I was military adviser in Saigon
when we first got in the war.
I remember this Eurasian gal.
She had these great big blue eyes.
They called her the Tarantula.
You ever run into her?
No, I don't think so.
You'd remember her.
She was a real ball-breaker.
Now, here's a beautiful lady.
Yes.
You have good taste, Joseph.
There's nothing like her in the skies.
She can manoeuvre with a military jet.
- Go just as fast and a lot farther.
- I think I'm falling in love.
The instructors at the Concorde flight school
tell me you scored very high.
Nothing but gold stars. Just like you, Paul.
Ever since I was a boy,
anything that flies has been my hobby.
- How long have you been flying?
- I stopped counting after 30 years.
Flown just about every aircraft there is,
through three wars and 40lb.
The only thing I'm afraid of is heights.
You afraid of anything, Metrand?
American pilots.
Captain?
Captain.
Coach Markov, can't we get a picture
of you and Gregory Valdikoff together?
This little muzhik? Sure.
Wait, wait... Now.
- What'd he say?
- He says I'm a genius.
What have the team enjoyed most
about the United States?
The children. Wonderful, happy children.
This is my daughter.
Irina.
Her name sign is Irina.
Irina, is the coach a good father?
She says I'm an ugly bear!
She must know something.
Excuse me.
Coach, are you excited
about taking the Concorde?
- Vassily!
- What?... Hey!
- What did he say?
- How should I know?
- You're still on that diet?
- Barely just.
Last night I came within that much
of a big, juicy steak.
- What did you eat?
- Fruit compote. It was torture.
I woke up in a cold sweat. I dreamt
I was being chased by a giant banana.
Cafe, messieurs?
- No cream and sugar for me.
- Two cups black.
Hm. Two cups black.
Oh, you pilots are such men.
They don't call it the cockpit
for nothing, honey.
Wait a minute.
That perfume of yours smells awfully familiar.
Je te remercie.
On peut avoir confiance en toi.
- What did she say?
- Probably the same as you say in English.
Thank you.
- How are we doing?
- Just waiting for Maggie Whelan.
Are you sure there was nothing
delivered for me at the studio...
...a package, an envelope, something like that?
OK, I'll talk to you from Paris.
Kevin.
- I was worried about you.
- You're too much.
- I want to check everything is OK.
- It's OK. I'm exhausted, that's all.
- You can sleep on the airplane.
- I'm going to have to lock the door.
Did those mysterious documents turn up?
No. You were right as usual.
Bon voyage, you beautiful lady.
- Your attention, please...
- Take care of yourself.
You too. I love you.
...is ready for immediate departure.
- Final call for the Concorde...
- Maggie.
- All aboard, please.
- Maggie.
- Have a wonderful trip. Thank you.
- Miss Whelan.
Maggie?
You killed him. You murdered Carl.
Killer!
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- Was the additional ice put on board?
- It's in the freezer.
It's just a precaution.
The heart's been packed in plenty of ice.
What we need now is a really fast trip.
Excuse me, please.
Would you mind if I sat here?
- Of course not.
- Thank you.
- I'll hang it up.
- Thank you.
- The transplant is for your son?
- Yes.
He just turned seven.
He just...
The colonel says, "You fathead,
you're supposed to ride the camel to town!"
There you are. I couldn't figure out
where you ran off to.
Paul, Joe, this, uh... Old lady here
is my wife, Amy.
She's stoned on Dramamine!
Tell her she's got nothing to worry about.
- It's just like taking a bus, Mrs Sande.
- She's afraid of buses too!
You'd better throw my husband out of here.
He wants to fly the plane.
- Have fun, boys.
- All right, we'll see you later. Uh-huh.
Nice-looking lady. Is he really her husband?
She's his fourth wife. He's a horny bastard.
Back in the '20s, when he was barnstorming...
...he bet he could put it to this
good-looking wing-walker.
He boffed her on the wing,
1,000 feet above El Paso.
His ass got so sunburnt
he couldn't sit down for a week!
- Who is he?
- That's your boss, sweetheart.
Eli Sande, president of Federation Airlines.
Hey, Coach!
Howdy, Eli!
Ma'am, would you wait
until we take off, please?
I have this bladder condition,
and when I'm nervous, I...
I enjoyed your farewell concert
at Carnegie Hall. It was a classic.
Thank you. It's nice to be remembered.
- Why did you retire?
- Well, honey, the road's a killer.
When I woke up not knowing
what town I was in, I decided to quit.
- Is this yours?
- Yeah. Thank you.
Did I read you're going to be
in the Moscow Jazz Festival?
It's kind of a homecoming for me.
I was born in Moscow.
I haven't been back since I was five years old.
- That's great. I'll be there to cheer you on.
- Oh, thank you, love.
The Lord is my shepherd
and I see what I want.
Sorry, sir. You'll have to store that
for take-off. I can put it in the cupboard.
Obviously, my dear, you don't congeal
the situation. See, this is my Siamese twin.
We go everywhere together. Right, Gretch?
That's right. They even sleep together.
You know, everybody's doing it.
Robert.
Why don't you defect?
You would make a good Russian.
- I don't want to be a Russian.
- I don't want to be American.
That's great. We'll live in Sweden.
Marriage is... Too complicated.
Let's just do interviews.
Er... Forgive me.
Excuse, please...
Sonia, I want to sit there.
You go sit in my seat.
Dulles Tower. Radar has
a two-minute hold. Hold in position.
Concorde into position and hold.
Attention, please. All Buzzard
test personnel stand by to clear the pad.
All personnel at launching pad 17,
this is a five-minute warning.
Five minutes to countdown.
- Please.
- Thank you.
I'm sorry to bother you.
- Hiya, Maggie.
- Joe, good to see you.
Good to see you. Maggie Whelan,
Peter O'Neill, our flight engineer.
- Captain Paul Metrand.
- Hello, Maggie.
I feel like I know you. I'm a fan of yours.
- First trip on Concorde?
- Yes.
I hope you'll enjoy it.
Haven't seen you since 1975,
that crash landing at Salt Lake City.
You still don't look like
you're more than 18 years old.
- How's your family?
- My boy is starting college.
- My wife has been dead for about a year.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Did you ever get married?
- No. Just a lot of fooling around.
- That'll keep you healthy.
- Depends on who you're fooling around with.
- Uh... Peter, will you give my friend a hand?
- Thank you, Joe.
I'll try. What number is it?
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain, Joe Patroni.
We'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Our flying time to Paris today
will be 3 hours and 50 minutes.
We'll be climbing up to an altitude
of 59,000 feet.
Our cruising speed will be Mach 2.
That's roughly 1400 miles an hour...
...twice the speed of sound.
The cabin will remain pressurised
to a comfortable 6,000 feet.
...and you'll barely notice the speed.
Enjoy your flight.
It's ringing.
Maggie?
I have the documents, Kevin.
I can't believe it. Your signature.
I don't want to believe any of this.
You had Carl Parker killed.
I didn't. I've done a lot of things I've been
ashamed of, but I am not a murderer.
No, I'm not sure I really know you at all.
I'll call my news department
and tell them about the documents.
- Don't hang me without an explanation.
- You hung yourself. What's to explain?
A lot. I'll meet you in Paris.
If you care about me...
...you won't do anything about
those documents until I get there.
I'll see you in Paris.
Maggie, you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm sorry. I feel like a fool sitting here crying.
It's all right.
Thank you, Joe.
Sure. Any time you feel like a good cry,
just come on back up.
It can't be traced. It's all set.
Concorde, this is Dulles.
You are clear for take-off.
Dulles Tower, Concorde. We're rolling.
- Boisie, I thought you were an atheist.
- What do I got to lose?
Yes, Superman!
Dulles Tower, this is
Harrison Industries' Annapolis test facility.
Our Buzzard test
will commence in 30 seconds.
Please continue monitoring our traffic.
Keep us informed. Good luck.
Stand by.
- Target plane is airborne.
- Beats me all to hell and back.
15 seconds to countdown.
Buzzard is operative.
Relay cameras operative.
On-board computer operative.
Stand by for countdown.
Ten, nine, eight...
...seven, six, five...
...four, three, two...
...one... We have ignition.
Washington Centre, good morning.
This is the Concorde.
We are with you, climbing to flight level 270.
We will accelerate
and climb 30 miles east of Sea Isle.
...to 590.
Concorde, this is Washington Centre.
Turn right heading 035.
Attack drone is off course.
- Stand by for termination.
- Standing by for termination.
Terminate.
Beginning primary destruct sequence.
Actuating alternate destruct.
Drone is not responding to commands.
- What's going on?
- A malfunction in the termination switch.
Can you bring it back?
Shooby-dooby.
Diddly-diddly-diddle.
Di-boo-ba-do, bwa, bwa, bwa...
Sing it out. Sing it out loud.
Sing it with the words.
I keep repeating, never leave me.
Never, never leave me.
'Cause if
If you go away...
Boisie... Maybe I don't have it any more.
Don't have it any more?
Does Ella still have it?
Does Sinatra still have it?
Does Sarah Vaughan still have it?
Well, Gretchen Carter definitely has it.
You're like fine wine. You get better with age.
You're gonna get those Russians drunk.
Little Buddy's heart has failed twice
since he collapsed.
It's a miracle he's still alive.
They don't expect him
to last the week, though.
Must not have been easy
to find a heart for him.
It's all computerised.
Thousands of hospitals around the world.
What they do is they look for a heart
with compatible tissues for transplanting.
Oh, God. That sounds so cold.
- And they found it last night?
- Yes.
A couple of days ago, there was an accident.
A little girl suffered... Brain damage
and died.
Her heart survived, and...
Buddy has a chance to live
if we ever get there in time.
Don't worry. He's gonna make it just fine.
You're sweet. Thank you.
We have a computer malfunction.
- What's its course?
- 035.
Jesus. That's the Dulles eastbound's.
Everybody relax.
Tell Washington what's happening.
Yes, sir.
.98...
.99...
Mach 1.
We're travelling at the speed of sound.
- You feel anything?
- No, I don't feel anything.
We are going faster than sound.
About as fast
as you were running that day, man.
Excuse me.
There's nobody home.
I'm not feeling too well.
You're a minority of one.
Attention, all aircraft.
Please maintain present flight altitudes.
We have an emergency.
Repeat, emergency.
We have a malfunctioning drone
off course from a test range.
- The Air Force jets are responding.
- Better hit the seat-belt sign.
Please sit down
and fasten your seat belts.
What's happening?
We're not turning back, are we?
No. There's probably
some turbulence out, that's all.
Sorry to bother you...
...but Washington Centre has advised us
of some military traffic in our airspace.
There's a possibility we may be asked
to make some minor course changes.
You'll be more comfortable if you please
stay seated with your seat belts fastened.
I'm gonna put on some music
but don't dance in the aisles.
That's one I never heard before.
People relax if you sound relaxed.
You should hear my yawn.
The drone's locked on target.
Four o'clock, Joseph.
Where did it go?
Shouldn't we continue evasive action, sir?
No. Those attack drones lock on
with a guidance system.
If we start juking around,
that needle-nosed bugger will nail us.
Let it make the first move.
Easy. Easy!
Here it comes.
I can't shake that bug bastard.
F-15s at ten o'clock.
She's dead.
The fighter's too close. If he overshoots,
we'll end up with a missile in our laps.
Pfff.
- Does that hurt?
- No.
- How about that?
- No.
I'm glad to see that nobody is hurt.
...but we do have a doctor on board
if anybody needs one.
- Oh, Captain.
- Ma'am.
- Um... who's driving the plane?
- It's on automatic pilot, ma'am.
Uh... Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention?
If everyone's OK,
we're going to continue to Paris.
We've run a complete check
and everything is in perfect order.
What happened?
A military test vehicle
accidentally strayed into our airspace.
We had to make some adjustments
in order to avoid a collision.
- Those were some adjustments!
- Good work, Joe.
Oh.
You deserve a rest, Captain.
Oui, oui, Kevin. Hm.
Some things are necessary.
There's only tragedy in drama. It's done.
Ah. Thank you, Kevin.
Hm.
Au revoir.
Samantha, is my plane ready?
And so...
...this famous old bear says...
"Who's sleeping.
...in my bed?"
Mr Harrison? This is Captain Moyer.
Mr Robelle is calling from Paris, sir.
Put him through.
- Andre?
- Oui, Kevin?
I'm putting us on the scrambler.
- Go ahead.
- The fighter plane should be airborne.
- What about the French air force?
- He's under French coastal radar.
When he attacks, he'll have four minutes
before the air force responds.
Four minutes will be an eternity
for the Concorde.
- I'll be in Paris before dark.
- Very good.
Good afternoon, Concorde.
This is Paris Control. Go ahead, please.
Nice to be with you, Paris Control.
We've just passed ten degrees west.
We should be on the ground
in under an hour.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are starting our gradual descent.
...for landing
at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris.
Captain Metrand
has turned on the seat-belt sign.
We request that you stay seated with
your seat belts fastened. Thank you.
Oh, please, madam,
would you mind taking your seat?
This is Paris Control.
We are advised of unknown
high-speed traffic in your area.
The air force is responding.
Please monitor French air-force traffic
on the following freq...
Paris Control, can you read me? Hello?
Hello?
We've lost communication with Paris Control.
Jesus Christ. There's an armed Phantom,
and he's coming right for us.
Full power.
Goddamn! He fired one!
Those missiles have a narrow seeking angle,
no more than 30 degrees.
If we make enough violent manoeuvres,
we may be able to cause a fly-by.
Oh, no. Something's happening again.
Mayday. This is Concorde. We're under
attack by an unmarked fighter plane.
Please respond.
I'd love to see my horoscope for today.
He's got three more.
The plane will break up
if I do more aerobatics.
- We need to set a false target.
- With a Very pistol?
The flare is small but it's hot.
O'Neill, emergency. Depressurise.
Depressurising.
Everyone, please put on your oxygen masks!
OK!
Turn her over!
People are being thrown all over.
God, we're rolling!
The hydraulic system's been hit.
One minute to intercept.
Roll it, Paul, so I can get at 'em!
Son of a bitch! It's jammed!
Peter!
The pin's broken.
Where's the other Very pistol?
In the rear storage.
By then, we'd have two missiles up our ass.
Missile at five o'clock!
He let number four go.
Missile at eight o'clock.
They're running after the engines.
I'm going to kill the heat source.
Turn it off!
Here we go!
Shut up!
- Tracers! He's on his cannons!
- Power on. Engine two.
Engine two.
No response, sir.
- Try engine four. Power.
- Starting engine four.
No flame, sir.
We're going straight down!
There's so much... There's so much fear!
- She's not responding, Captain.
- Engine three. Power.
Oh, dear Lord, please help us!
Oh, God, no! It's the worst nightmare!
Please, no! We're going in the ocean!
Engine three no response, sir.
Power, engine one.
I think my feet are getting wet.
Starting flare.
- Number one, good ignition, sir.
- Try number two again.
Ooowee!
A thing like that could ruin his whole day.
Engine four running, sir.
Starting three.
Ladies and gentlemen,
you can remove your oxygen masks.
We still don't know who attacked the aircraft.
As soon as we get any information,
we'll pass it on to you.
In a few minutes we'll be touching down
at our alternate airport in Paris...
where barrier nets will assist our landing
if needed. Thank you.
The bathroom's broken.
You boys OK?
We may not be able to stop this big lady.
The reverse thrusters are out on one side.
- No brakes?
- The hydraulic system is damaged.
I don't know if they're going to work or not.
My wife thinks, uh... we'll all be safer
if I'm up here in the cockpit.
I'll ride it out with you.
- Le Bourget's dead ahead, Paul.
- Final landing checklist.
- Landing gear down.
- Landing gear coming down.
I landed into nets in Vietnam. It was like
trying to stop a bullet with crepe paper.
- Emergency brake.
- Ground speed 110.
- Ground speed 95.
- Trying the brakes.
We can't stop!
90...
85...
End of the runway, 300 metres.
After that, this airplane buys us a farm.
Ladies and gentlemen... welcome to Paris.
The helicopter will be here in five minutes.
- Just enough time to make it.
- Please, Dr Stone, let's hurry.
I'll meet you at the briefing.
I'm going to call Sarah.
Mr O'Neill...
Thank you.
Thank you too, sugar.
Captain...
Captain.
- Has this changed your flight plans?
- I'm sorry, I can't discuss it.
- What is your reaction to the near tragedy?
- Thank goodness it wasn't a tragedy.
Miss Whelan, four terrorist groups
have taken credit for the attack.
...as a protest against the Olympics.
The world's gone mad! Excuse me.
If this plane is ready,
we're going to Moscow tomorrow.
Nobody is going to stop this flight.
Was this a publicity stunt?
Repair work going to be done here?
If everything's up to spec, the crew
will ferry her to de Gaulle late tonight.
Isabelle?
Joseph, you're my guest for dinner.
And I have the perfect lady for you.
I guarantee you'll fall in love.
Be careful about his guarantees,
Captain Patroni.
What does this perfect lady look like?
For you, Porky Pig.
- He was the best money could buy.
- Apparently not good enough.
Don't worry, Kevin. I'm prepared.
I have already spoken to someone.
OK? Come on.
- Oh!
- Phew.
Paris always hated foreigners.
He looks cute when he's wet.
He reminds me of a happy fish.
Find us a table. I'll call and see how the
repairs are going on the Concorde. Viens.
Here. Have a seat.
- Oh, you're soaking wet.
- Uh-huh.
- A happy fish.
- A happy fish, yeah.
You're adorable when you're embarrassed.
- You look like a married man.
- What does a married man look like?
His smile says no.
His eyes, they say, "When?"
Well, when?
I was married.
My wife was killed in a car accident.
- Do you miss her?
- Very much.
- Do you have children?
- I have a boy. He's starting college.
Ah, oui? My son just started college.
The Sorbonne.
College? You don't look old enough
to have a child in the fifth grade.
- Just make-up.
- Oh, no.
- What is your son to study?
- Medicine.
What a coincidence. So is my Phillippe.
We have a lot in common, Captain.
- You're a very shy man.
- My wife used to say that.
An understanding woman is very important.
Maybe you'll ask when again.
I promise.
What a night to work.
We have to check the cargo hold.
What are this week's numbers?
8-7-5-7.
A hand, strong man.
The ohmmeter.
Here we go.
All right.
- When did you start wearing glasses?
- Last week.
They're, uh... Just for reading.
I'm gradually learning to accept
most of life's humiliations.
I've written this draft
as the announcement for the press.
It gives the complete details
of Harrison Industries' illegal activities.
"Done on my behalf
and with my full knowledge...
...the responsibility for these actions
rests solely with me."
Maggie... would you look at this for me?
Writing is not my strong suit.
Maybe you can polish the rough edges.
I need some air, Kevin.
I feel like walking, Kevin.
You did it again, Stormy.
You said it wouldn't rain.
Let's go to your hotel.
Is that going to solve everything?
I'll broadcast the documents
as soon as I get to Moscow.
It'll be old news by then.
I made you a promise.
A promise? You made me a promise? Oh...
What a pathetic joke.
Maggie, the hotshot reporter,
the great judge of character.
I was never going to fall in love
and get hurt.
That couldn't happen to me.
Oh, damn it. I fell so hard.
Talk about love being blind.
Oh, Kevin Harrison, you are perfect, though.
Attractive, charming, intelligent...
...and destructive.
Why couldn't you be straight with me?
I would have done anything for you.
I've never loved anyone the way I love you.
But it's over.
The saddest part of the whole thing
is... That I still love you.
I'll really miss us, Doc.
Taxi!
Maggie?
Control circuits are in good order.
What time is their departure?
3.30.
No problems here.
Close the, er... Cargo door.
I'll check the pressure sealing.
Froelich, some hot coffee?
- Froelich?
- I'll be right out!
You see? You didn't forget very much.
I guess it's like swimming.
Once you learn how...
Just like a happy fish.
This is the nicest evening I've had
in a long, long time.
Me too.
Again?
You haven't changed.
You're even more beautiful.
I love you.
As long as I've known you,
you've never said that to me.
People change.
I think you should get used to hearing it.
Je t'aime.
I'd like us to try again, Isabelle.
Today, when we were
that far above the ocean...
...life seemed very short.
The plane is at de Gaulle.
The repairs are completed.
- A bomb?
- No. Bombs are unreliable.
This way is certain. The change in pressure
will tear the plane apart.
How long before Concorde is destroyed?
Ten minutes. It's not quick,
but it's completely efficient.
- When I pay you, leave France.
- Yes, sir.
At four o'clock it will be finished.
Tell your friend to enjoy himself.
It's better to be rich.
- Good morning, Joseph.
- Paul.
I don't know how the hell to thank you.
I never was a believer in love at first sight,
but that Francine... whoo!
What a night! She was really...
...special!
For 2,000 francs,
she'd better have been special.
Wait. Wait a minute.
Are you... You trying to tell me
she was... A hooker?
As you Americans say, a real pro.
All that stuff about coincidence.
A son in college in medicine.
An understanding woman.
You goddamn son of a bitch.
She was great!
What are friends for?
- Terrific!
- You're gonna pay.
OK.
- Lovely afternoon, isn't it, gentlemen?
- What makes you so happy?
Oh, a little escargot. Roast pork,
a magnificent chocolate mousse.
What will you tell Sarah
when you go home?
Sarah? Sarah... Sarah who?
Your attention, please.
This will be the only boarding call
for the Concorde flight to Moscow.
No visitors will be permitted on board.
Thank you.
- Circuit breakers. Check.
- Check.
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
Emergency evacuation
and emergency lights armed.
- Armed.
- Hang on a sec for some coffee.
I think I said some things last night.
I was very tired.
I didn't believe you anyway.
Isabelle...
I'm not tired now. It's still je t'aime.
- No smoking signs on.
- Check.
It's easy for you to say it.
- Fasten your seat belt, please.
- Thank you.
Let me take your fur.
No, it's OK. I have a very cold hand
and I prefer sticking in.
Thank you.
Isabelle?
- Let me take it.
- No, it's OK.
Dogs are not allowed.
Oh, young lady, please.
Don't mis-con-screw me.
You see, this is not an average dog.
This is my seeing-eye dog. I need him.
Seeing-eye dogs
are usually German shepherds.
Oh. You mean he's not?
- I'm sorry.
- I know.
- But it's against the rules.
- Rules?
Rules! Hear that? Can you say to the lady
what do you think about those rules?
Me too.
Monsieur?
Monsieur?
Something's wrong. Call security.
Ohl Oh, pardon, monsieur. Your raincoat!
Oh!
Arretezl.
Stop!
Grab that man!
What the hell?...
Lmbecilel.
- Did we hit him?
- I don't think so.
There was our wake turbulence.
I know him. That's Froelich.
Mechanic on the Concorde.
You're very quiet.
- I was just thinking about my wife.
- It must get very lonely, my friend.
Sir, Paris Control advises of a change
in en route weather conditions.
A storm front is moving though Germany.
We should take a southerly course.
- Give me a heading.
- Right, sir.
Joseph...
I know a great woman who works
for the French embassy in Moscow.
I'll bet you do!
Time for me to do some flying of my own.
I see you have a new one.
We're triplets.
- You don't need the ladies' room?
- Never again.
Oh, what a pretty girl she is!
- Tired?
- Mm.
- You look like you lost your best friend.
- Maybe I did.
Why don't you stretch out?
I can sit back here.
Thanks.
I only regret we didn't have more kids.
After our boy, we kept putting it off.
Then, about a year ago,
we decided to adopt. But...
I always wanted a big family.
I guess I'm one of those wholesome slobs.
Coach Markov would like to know
if his daughter could visit.
Oh, of course.
It's all right. You can come in.
- Are you sure this is no trouble?
- None at all.
- Hi, baby.
- Hello.
This is my daughter Irina.
She says hi.
It's just like Disneyland up here.
This shows how high we are.
This shows how fast we're going.
And this is Mickey Mouse.
- What was that?
- You'd better get down, sweetheart.
I thought something popped open.
- I don't hear anything.
- Yeah, I guess not.
Thank you for coming by.
- Thank you very much, gentlemen.
- You're very welcome.
Boy, I could swear that floor is moving.
You're spaced, baby. Spaced.
Gremlins.
I'm getting vibration on the yoke.
- Let's run a complete systems check.
- Yes, sir.
- Altimeters.
- Set and checked.
- What's wrong?
- Hm? Oh.
I just can't get comfortable.
It feels like my seat's coming loose.
Some joke.
- What's that noise?
- I don't hear anything.
- Would you turn off the music, please?
- Sure.
- Come on.
- Excuse me. It's back here.
Yeah?
- Airspeed indicators.
- Uh... Airspeed indicator, check.
OK.
There's a whistling and a banging noise
from the bottom of the aircraft.
Jesus, the cargo door?
The warning light should indicate if it's open.
Peter?
It's not working.
It was all right at the pre-flight check.
I'm going back to check that noise, Joseph.
Let's have the seat-belt sign.
Please return to your seats
and fasten your seat belts. Thank you.
- Is something wrong, Captain?
- Nothing we're sure of.
- What aren't you sure of?
- Don't worry. It's nothing serious.
Sit down.
The cargo door is about to open.
We've got explosive decompression!
Our computers
and our control systems are out!
Try an emergency system.
We're out of control!
Come on, emergency systems.
Give us some help. C'mon.
Eli!
Airspeed 320. Altitude 11,000 feet.
My God. We fell 20,000 feet.
I have radio contact with Munich.
I'll advise them of our condition.
I better go back and check the passengers.
Yeah.
- Eli, you OK?
- I had the best seat in the house!
Listen to me, everybody.
You can take off your oxygen masks.
We're at 11,000 feet and you can breathe.
But if any of you still feel the altitude
or you feel light-headed...
...then use the oxygen.
The cargo door has blown off.
It's affected the airplane's primary function.
That's why you're feeling vibration.
We've activated a secondary system
and it's working perfectly.
We're in contact with Munich Centre
for landing instructions.
I'm going to ask the crew
to pass out some pillows.
When we land, put them over your knees.
...and assume a tucked position.
They'll show you how.
- The rear cabin's OK, sir.
- Good.
We're gonna make it.
Mrs Sande, take this seat.
The jettison pumps are open.
We're losing fuel. I can't shut them off.
Munich, advise nearest airfield.
This is Munich Centre.
Your position is 40 miles north-west
of Patscherkofel intersection.
Innsbruck is your closest airfield.
- What's our flying time to Innsbruck?
- About 15 minutes.
- Do we have enough fuel?
- No way.
The Alps dead ahead.
Patscherkofel? I used to ski there.
- Is there a snowfield?
- The snow lasts all year.
I love you, Robert Palmer.
If we ever come in Moscow,
I want to marry you.
Why wait?
Do you, Alicia Rogov, take me, Robert Palmer,
to be your lawfully wedded husband?
I do.
And do you, Robert Palmer...
...take Alicia Rogov
to be your lawfully wedded wife?
I do.
I now pronounce us man and wife.
Kiss the groom.
Alicia...
God bless you both.
Understand your decision is to make
an emergency landing at Patscherkofel.
The Alpine ski patrol
is marking a runway.
...and is in radio contact with Munich Centre.
- You ever come down on your belly?
- Sure.
In a simulator.
That's terrific.
Well, that makes two of us.
Isabelle, we'll be trying to land in a few
minutes. Will you tell your passengers?
- I'll tell them.
- Isabelle...
Je t'aime.
Patscherkofel Rescue Centre.
Do you read me, Munich?
Loud and clear. Go ahead.
- How much time do we have left?
- Between eight and nine minutes.
- So please hurry.
- We copy.
Concorde, there is a 15-foot base
of hard-packed snow at Patscherkofel.
We're going for it, Munich.
Thanks for everything.
Good luck, Concorde.
This is Munich Centre, out.
- Altitude 8800 feet. Airspeed 180.
- There's one hell of a crosswind.
Mr Harrison, this is Captain Moyer.
We'll be landing in 30 minutes,
11 am Washington time.
We can now confirm that a Federation
World Airlines Concorde en route to Moscow
...is attempting an emergency landing
on a mountainside in the Alps.
Maggie Whelan, anchorwoman
on our nightly news, is a passenger.
Just a moment.
I have just heard that we have been
linked via satellite with Munich Centre...
which is receiving reports
directly from the landing site.
They are seven minutes away.
Medical assistance
has reached the landing area.
Altitude 8300. Airspeed 160.
Christ, this is like threading a needle.
Patscherkofel dead ahead.
We only get one chance at this bastard.
I can see the plane.
There are large holes in the fuselage.
Metal is ripped open.
She's shaking, fighting the wind.
Here we go.
Airspeed 130.
- Stall warning!
- I hear it!
- Stick shaker!
- Think I can't feel it?
Power off. Engines off.
Brace! Brace!
I smell gas!
The plane's going to explode!
Clear the plane!
Clear the plane!
Pitch is off.
Irina!
Listen to me! Listen!
You want to get out of here safely,
then sit down! Sit down!
Come.
Coming through, coming through!
We're OK.
Maggie? Maggie!
Baby, you OK?
Come on.
Let's go, Peter.
Clear below!
Watch yourselves! Watch out!
Watch your heads!
All right, look out below!
We're dropping ladders.
Watch your step.
People are coming out of the plane.
There's a strong smell of jet fuel.
I should hear soon
if there are any fatalities.
I see three more people coming out.
My husband!
Come on, there's no time!
Move them up that ladder!
Move 'em up!
- Come on, Maggie.
- Oh! The documents!
- Maggie!
- Miss Whelan!
Your turn. OK.
Here's a passenger.
Miss, were there any fatalities?
- I don't need any help.
- Easy.
All right, let her go.
Hurry up!
Here at the Rescue Centre,
it's a scene of jubilation.
Men and women in tears.
A small child embracing her father.
They've asked me to clear this channel.
But I will be broadcasting from Moscow
about these events.
...and information I have received
on a major breaking news story.
This is Maggie Whelan at the crash site,
grateful to be alive.
- Let's go.
- Come on, Joseph.
Come on.
If everybody's out of the rear section,
we're all out.
The roof's collapsing. Everybody off.
Quickly! The fuel tank's out front.
It'll explode.
