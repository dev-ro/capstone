I'd been living with Marianne
almost 3 years
in an apartment belonging to her.
Things were fine between us,
till she said one day:
Got a second?
Yes, why?
To tell you something,
but it may be a bad time.
Go on, say it. What's wrong?
I'm pregnant.
You're pregnant...
That's great.
Is it a problem for you?
Abel...
I'm pregnant, but not from you.
What?
I'm not pregnant from you.
So... from who then?
Paul.
You had a thing with Paul?
Yes.
Since when?
A little over a year.
But Paul is someone...
so...
So what?
So different, so...
Different from who?
I don't know... you know Paul's family.
They know.
If you've seen his family,
what does it mean?
It means we may have to get married.
It means a lot to his parents.
Yes, they're a bit conventional, but...
You haven't chosen a date?
It's been saved.
Paul wants you to come.
Unless it bothers you. It's up to you.
When is it?
The 26th.
Of this month?
We prefer to act quickly, because of...
You want me to pack my stuff?
You still have time,
but before the 26th is best.
What's today?
The 16th.
I have to go. I'll be late.
Maybe it wasn't
the right time to tell you.
I'm glad you're taking it well.
He thought you'd be angry.
I kept reassuring him.
Can he call you today?
Well, maybe not today.
Work well.
What will you tell Paul?
That you were great.
That you were intelligent.
That you understood.
Abel?
Nothing.
What a loser.
Thanks, that's nice.
At first I didn't feel much pain.
This surprised me.
I almost thanked Marianne
for being so brutal,
sparing us long goodbyes.
I even thought at times
that I expected this.
That evening,
I tried to forget Marianne
with another woman.
But it's the other woman I forgot.
Today our main competitor is Spain.
Their pigs are cheaper then Breton pigs.
Trucks come to the Rungis market
full of pigs slaughtered in Spain,
cheaper than Breton ones.
And that needs to be explained.
What age do you get them
and for how long?
I graduated in journalism
and began working.
I recorded people's complaints.
Okay, 6 months minimum.
My life started taking shape.
Marianne and Paul
were now childhood memories.
My childhood slowly grew distant.
The years went by for me too.
A FAITHFUL MAN
I'd almost forgotten Paul
when I heard that he died,
8 or 9 years later.
In his sleep, all of a sudden.
I went to the cemetery for his funeral,
where I saw Marianne,
with whom I'd lost touch.
She'd had a son with Paul.
His name was Joseph.
At the cemetery I saw Eve,
Paul's younger sister.
I knew her as a child.
She had become a woman.
I was interested only in Marianne.
I kept wondering:
"What is she thinking?
"Perhaps of me?"
Then I thought:
"No, she must be thinking of Paul now."
Probably recalling their life together.
I didn't enter into it.
After the funeral, I wondered:
"Do I go?
"Do I forget about her forever?
"Or do I make an effort?"
After the ceremony,
Abel offered to drive Joseph and me home.
It was uncomfortable seeing him,
but I had nothing to blame him for.
At times I even felt a bit guilty.
I thought at least I've known him
for a while.
I wasn't in for a bad surprise.
Shall I come up, stay with you a bit?
Some other time, okay?
Okay.
Call me?
All right.
Don't hesitate.
I promise I will.
Coming, honey?
Goodbye, Joseph!
You've reached Paul.
Leave a message.
If you're lucky, I'll call back.
Marianne called me two weeks later.
We met at a restaurant
where we used to go,
Paul, her and me.
I hesitated before calling.
Then I thought
Paul would have advised me to.
Don't you think?
Yes, I do.
Well, maybe, anyway.
How are you doing?
Are you seeing anyone?
At the moment?
Nothing serious.
What's today's special?
Beef and carrots with wasabi sauce
That sounds a bit heavy.
Maybe try the jasmine steak.
Sure, why not?
I can't choose. Can you choose for me?
Okay.
We chatted during lunch.
About Paul of course.
Only nice things.
And about us too, a little.
What kind of work do you do now?
Communications advisor
at Foreign Affairs.
Really? That was your dream.
Travel a lot?
Not at the moment.
During the entire meal,
I was dying to ask:
"Did you ever think of me?"
And also:
"Would you like to try
living together again?"
But I thought it was too soon.
She suggested coffee at her place.
So you lived here.
For almost 9 years.
It didn't change much.
Just the color of the walls.
No, it's the same.
We rented a country house too.
I'm giving it up next week.
I never liked it much.
Paul's stuff?
I'll give it all away.
I prefer.
Except a few letters, a few pictures.
He was your friend.
If you want something, take it.
Marianne, no.
Coffee?
I'd love one.
Still like it short?
Still, yes.
Hello, Joseph.
That's Dad's stuff.
Yeah, I know.
Your mom told me.
Did you know him?
Very well, for a long time.
You want to stay here now?
Me? No, why?
Would you want to?
I hadn't thought about it.
I'm sure of it.
Sure of what?
That you thought about it.
We'll see about that later, okay?
I've known your mom
for a while too, so...
she'll decide. Okay?
It's Mom who killed Dad.
What?
What did you say?
I know she killed him.
What are you talking about?
I'm telling you what I know.
Why would she have?
I don't know yet.
How did she do it?
With poison.
With poison?
No one did a blood test?
You know, usually,
when someone dies,
the doctor does a checkup.
If he has a doubt,
he asks for what's called an autopsy.
Mom slept with the doctor.
Are you sure?
I saw them over there.
Where is the doctor's office?
In the area.
Want something, Joseph?
No.
"No thank you."
No thank you, Mom.
You have to go back to school tomorrow.
I know.
I'll go make some tea.
Get to know each other.
What's the doctor's name?
The name of a flower.
The name of a flower.
Dahlia? Dr. Dahlia?
Marguerite?
Nope.
It starts with a "P".
A "P"?
Petunia?
Poppy?
Does the doctor still see your mom?
When she's sick, yes.
Not often.
A flower that starts with a "P".
Poinsettia?
How are you two?
Fine...
My brother had just died.
At the funeral, I saw Abel again.
As everyone left,
I asked myself the same question.
I never understood
why Marianne had chosen
my brother Paul over Abel.
I liked my brother a lot,
even though he treated me
like a kid.
But for me, when I was 13, 14,
Abel was the most attractive man alive.
I was always on the lookout for him.
His hair, his voice,
the way he walked...
Everything about him moved me.
I knew every detail of his schedule.
Of course he didn't notice.
He was blind to me.
Even in a nice dress
when I made myself pretty,
I was just a kid to him.
I didn't count.
I thought only of him.
I was sad to be too young.
I took pictures of him in secret.
I looked at them every night
under my sheets.
He'd take me everywhere,
to school, to the pool, to dance class.
It was like we were living together.
I remember,
one day he left his car unlocked.
I even...
Wait, what am I saying?
It was before. I was younger.
Anyway, I opened the door...
and took a picture of myself inside,
like I was next to him
and he was driving.
I imagined us going to Venice.
On our honeymoon.
That day I thought:
"He saw me for sure.
We are a couple. We are in love.
We're going away together.
The car stopped. He ran off.
He hadn't seen me.
He was late for work.
That day,
without money for a subway ticket,
I walked home from the suburbs.
I hated Marianne
for taking him from me.
when she chose my brother Paul.
I said to myself:
"You still have a chance."
But when Marianne left Abel,
he moved and I lost track of him.
For the next five years,
I didn't see Abel.
Of course I had a few flings,
but none worth telling.
Now that I think about it,
all that time,
I only did one thing well.
I grew up.
Then one day, by chance, I saw Abel.
I'm Eve, Paul's sister.
Hello, Eve.
You've grown.
Thanks.
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
And you?
Didn't you do theater?
Yes, but I stopped with theater.
I'm in real estate now.
You're freezing.
Your teeth are chattering.
Are you busy now?
I'm late. I have to get going.
I'll drop off your scarf.
No, it's a gift, okay?
Have a nice day, lovers.
See you around...
Bye, Eve.
Not even a lover,
just a broke client
looking for a studio.
But that day,
Abel seemed to see me.
Finally.
I could tell
he was still attracted by Marianne,
that he wanted to get back with her.
I could tell.
Like he wanted to reclaim
what Paul had taken from him.
It made me sad.
That this saddened me
at Paul's funeral
made me a little ashamed.
Without much experience about that stuff,
I felt I had a chance now.
But how would I go about it with Abel?
I shouldn't say it,
or even have thought it,
but sometimes I wished
Marianne would die.
All of a sudden, painlessly.
Like my brother.
How much are the peonies?
- How much?
- 15 euros.
Peonies
What's the emergency?
I'm okay. It's not for me.
I'm fine.
I wanted to ask you a question.
Go ahead.
I was a friend of Paul's.
Oh yes, Paul.
I saw you at the funeral.
I wanted to ask
if his death seemed natural.
He died of a heart attack in his sleep.
A valve problem, I'd say.
Common.
No one did an autopsy?
I didn't find it necessary.
His wife called me
early in the morning.
I went as fast as I could,
but when I got there,
he'd been dead for 2 hours.
He was cold.
Okay.
The burial certificate wasn't a problem.
Why? Did you notice something?
No, but he never mentioned
any heart trouble.
Maybe he didn't know.
Is that possible?
Yes, of course.
The heart can suddenly stop.
It's capricious,
like it's fed up with living.
Thank you.
There was no trace of poisoning,
nothing suspicious.
No, not at all.
Do you have a personal reason
for coming?
Not really. I know their son a little.
His name is Joseph.
He's unsettled by his father's death.
That's normal.
More unsettled than his mother.
I see...
Have you known her long?
She was with us at university.
I forget her name.
Apparently a very attractive woman.
I'll say.
That's for sure.
Even for you.
Not at all.
I'm gay, you know.
Really?
- Does it shock you?
- No, not at all.
A gay doctor is rare, isn't it?
Should I put it on my door?
Not at all.
Do I owe you anything?
Of course not.
Is the doctor really gay?
What doctor?
Pivoine.
Who told you he was gay?
He did.
You went to see him?
I need to take my blood pressure.
Nothing serious.
And you knew Dr. Pivoine?
No, I saw a prescription
in your bathroom.
He told you he was gay
without your asking?
I guessed, so I asked him.
You asked him just like that?
You were interested in knowing?
It was just to talk.
Maybe he says it to keep women at bay.
He's no more gay than me or you.
How do you know?
He tried picking me up.
If he said he was gay,
either he lied or it's recent.
Why would he have lied?
Yeah, why would he have?
You've lost it, Malarky.
You know,
there's one thing I've learned.
Every family has a guilty party.
Trust me.
The killer is a member of the family?
Who?
I don't know yet.
I'll question the mother.
That poor woman is a master manipulator.
The mother? But she'll never talk!
It's the brother who killed her
How do you know?
Only one with the key.
- Make it fast.
- Give me two days.
It's the brother who did it.
With a killer at large,
that's an eternity.
What do you think? He'll strike again.
- Another victim?
- Yes...
and we'll stop him.
He saw the movie before?
No way.
Someone told him.
No, he's just like that.
As a kid, he only liked murder stories.
He watches police shows
and often guesses who did it.
He hangs around precincts,
chats with officers.
Maybe he wants to be a cop.
I'll make herbal tea.
I saw the doctor.
- He said...
- He won't tell the truth.
Why not?
He's a liar.
He's not gay.
Mom told you so.
I'm going to bed.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, honey.
Does he bring up his father's death?
Not often.
Joseph and Paul used to fight a lot.
Paul wanted to send him
to boarding school.
Joseph didn't want to go?
Not at all.
Neither did I.
You never looked at me like this.
How am I looking at you?
In a weird way.
As if...
As if what?
You suspected me of...
Of being unfaithful?
Or worse.
There's nothing worse.
I feel like it...
You used to whisper my name in my ear.
I liked that a lot.
You don't do it anymore.
What's on for today?
The Parliament questions the minister.
- You prepare what he'll answer?
- Or won't.
What will they ask?
Who knows?
They don't tell you first?
Not always. It depends.
You give political advice?
You thought
I advised him on his ties?
Or his hairdo.
That happens too.
So? He follows your advice?
For his ties? Yes.
You discussed it with Paul?
You'll make me late.
If ever Joseph says I killed Paul,
don't believe him.
It's to scare you.
So you'll go away.
Joseph!
Joseph, come here.
Hey, how are you?
Recognize me?
Yeah.
Want to get a drink?
I have homework.
Just 5 minutes.
Okay, I'll get my bag.
You have lots of homework?
Sort of a lot.
Did you like your dad?
But we fought a lot.
Did it affect you when he died?
I was surprised,
like everyone else.
And very sad.
You didn't cry at the funeral.
Because I'd cried before.
You get along with Abel?
You can tell me the truth.
I don't like Abel.
Why?
He stole my mom.
He didn't steal her.
Don't exaggerate.
I'm not exaggerating.
She takes care only of him.
What does she do?
Last week,
she bought him two pairs of socks.
That's normal.
They're a couple now.
They live together.
You know, sometimes
a man needs a woman.
They're not a real couple.
Not a real couple? How do you know?
If they were a real couple,
they'd do it more often.
But... what are you talking about?
You know.
But...
how do you know they don't?
I listen to them.
How do you listen to them?
I put this under the mattress.
Wait.
Want to listen?
No, no... it's none of my business.
You don't hear much anyway.
Yeah, not much.
See?
Excuse me.
I got his feedback.
He'd like this to be less vague,
less doublespeak.
You know his style.
He already said the same thing here
about Tunisia.
Want me to help?
No thanks.
- Can you leave me?
- Sure.
As I was working,
I couldn't stop thinking about Abel.
I thought: "He's uncomfortable."
Is he really afraid of me?
As for me, my life continued as before,
with no particular problem,
but with a vague anxiety
that wouldn't go away.
Imagining Marianne
as a poisoner unsettled me,
but excited me a little too.
See how Paul's sister changed?
Who?
Eve, Paul's sister.
Yeah, maybe...
She kept staring at you
at the cemetery.
Really?
If you get sick of me,
you won't have to look far.
I'm good for the time being, thanks.
Can I ask you something?
When you were with both Paul and me,
did you make love to us
the same day?
Not often. I tried to avoid that.
Did you prefer one of us?
I mean, physically.
Honestly, no.
Did he do stuff that you liked?
Most men do the same thing.
- How about you?
- What?
You must have seen other women.
When we were together?
Don't pretend to try to remember.
Not the same day.
I couldn't have.
Do you ever miss Paul?
Yes, when you're not here.
Sometimes I put flowers on his tomb.
I know.
Want a ride?
Okay.
Ever kill anyone?
Ever fight in a war?
- Ever fight in a war?
- What war?
But you wanted to.
To kill someone?
No, not really.
Everyone wants to, at some point.
Who told you that?
A cop.
Did you ever want to kill someone?
Yes... you.
Would you mind
if I married your mom?
Yes.
Why?
You'd rather she stay alone?
She's not alone.
No, but...
I can leave whenever.
I don't care.
I never could talk to children.
If I speak to them like adults,
it doesn't work.
If I speak to them like kids,
it doesn't work either.
Want to keep her to yourself?
So she's all yours?
If I married her,
you and I could get along.
I don't want to.
That's not very nice.
You won't always be a kid.
You'll grow up.
One day you'll be a teen.
One day you'll want to leave her.
Yes.
You're no exception to the rule.
All young adults want to leave home.
Boys, girls, everyone.
Not me.
You'll see.
When you're 14 or 15,
you'll see.
I was just like you.
Don't cry, Joseph, don't cry.
I won't marry your mother, okay?
I promise I won't.
Do you believe me?
Here...
don't cry.
Don't cry, honey.
Still think she poisoned your dad?
I'm investigating.
You'll keep me posted?
That depends.
It would be nice of you.
Get going, you'll be late.
I won't go with red eyes.
No one will see. Hurry.
What did you want to tell me?
You said Joseph is Paul's son?
But when you told me,
how could you know?
Women know that stuff.
Did you do a test back then?
There was no need.
Without a test, how did you know?
I...
I let chance advise me.
What do you mean?
I loved Paul and you.
I could have two lovers
and love both but...
my child could have only one father.
So I played heads or tails.
It landed on Paul.
Did Paul know?
Of course not.
I told him Joseph was his son.
He accepted it, no questions asked.
He knew we were together.
Of course he knew.
But he never asked...
He recognized the child
without questioning it.
You didn't mind losing me?
It hurt at first.
And then...
I...
I was upset with chance
for not choosing you.
I won a child...
and lost a man I loved.
But I loved Paul too.
As much as you.
In the end he was a very good father
and took good care of Joseph.
Chance made a good choice.
You can put it that way.
Why are you here?
How are you?
Can we talk for a minute?
Want to get coffee?
No, I won't be long.
Listen,
I have to tell you something.
What?
I want Abel.
Deep down, you don't love him.
The proof is that you decided
to marry my brother.
You chose Paul.
After he died, you took in Abel
because you were alone.
You needed someone near.
What business is this of yours?
I can't take it anymore.
You live with Abel
and don't love him.
And I've loved him forever.
You?
Yes, me.
I can't explain why.
I don't understand myself.
So I'm asking you...
Leave him for me.
What if I say no?
Then it's war.
And we'll see who wins.
Why are you here?
To talk to you.
Here?
Or elsewhere.
Is it urgent?
Meet me in the entrance.
Okay.
What is it? Is there a problem?
I saw Marianne.
Yes, and?
I told her everything.
About what?
About me and you.
What are you talking about?
Do you like me?
Physically?
Not only.
Yeah, you...
you're very...
I like you.
But it's more than that.
Now you have to look at me.
As a kid, I could understand,
but now...
You know, I'm not a virgin anymore.
Sure I had a few flings,
but they sucked.
Really sucked.
To cum, I'd think of you.
I'll never have another man but you.
Never.
I'll wait the time it takes.
All you have to do is say:
"Come."
This is what you discussed
with Marianne?
Okay.
What exactly did you ask her?
You.
I asked her for you.
What did she answer?
That's between me and her.
I was in a war over Abel.
For several days, I wondered what to do.
Agree to fight?
I wasn't sure I'd win.
One night I had an idea.
A strange idea.
It took me by surprise.
Wake up.
I was thinking of something.
Make love to her.
With who?
Eve.
What?
Once or twice, to see?
Maybe that'll suffice.
What time is it?
What's this about?
About Eve.
Are you listening?
Paul's sister. Remember her?
I'm suggesting you make love with her.
You may be surprised.
When I had the idea,
I was surprised too.
The more I think about it,
the more I'm convinced.
I know she went to see you.
She told me.
I know she turns you on.
Don't say no. She's pretty.
Why are you telling me this?
She says I'm wrong for you,
that you're her life,
she'll die of sorrow.
You're worried about her?
I don't care about her.
I'm worried about you.
Because...
I know you.
So you're worried about me.
Of course.
I know what you're capable of.
I never hesitated between you two.
I know she's not your type.
But one never knows.
You're so easy to have.
As for her,
I'm sure it can only do her good.
Meaning?
She'll probably feel...
set free.
Set free from you.
Are you serious?
Totally serious.
You realize what you're suggesting?
It's not like you.
You don't know me well.
What if it becomes serious with her?
I'll run the risk.
I'm the one running the risk!
What risk?
The risk of losing you.
Trust me.
You're less weak than you think.
What do you mean?
Think.
If you do it, I have one request.
What?
Don't tell her it was my idea.
Why not?
I don't think it would be elegant.
She was right.
I was less weak than I thought.
I thought I was strong enough
to go through with it.
Then and there, groggy as I was,
I knew I'd follow her advice.
Eve?
It's me.
Abel.
I see you called Eve.
So?
So...
She said to come.
And you're going there now?
Yeah!
It was your idea, remember.
If you want, I'll stay.
No, go on.
I'll go if you insist.
Just one thing.
What?
Want me to help with your stuff?
What then?
If I sleep with Eve...
as you advise me to do, right?
Does that mean I should live with her?
It seems to be the case.
She said to bring stuff.
We can have sex without getting together.
You mean
you'll come back here at night?
Yeah, why not?
Like you, when...
you saw Paul during the day
and came here at night.
You're still upset with me.
No, but sometimes I think about it.
It looks like you've made up your mind.
If you go, you go.
You said to sleep with her 2 or 3 times.
Imagine if we decide to live together
a little longer?
Okay, I'm imagining.
So what do I do with my stuff,
take it or leave it?
Come on, Abel...
Her place is really small.
Can I leave some stuff here?
Books...
For a few days, maybe, but...
If you go,
I may also want another man.
And even...
move him in here with me.
You already have someone?
Is that it?
Is that why you suggested I go?
You already met someone?
It no longer concerns you.
How are you?
So you took them.
- What?
- Dad's shoes.
Yeah, do you mind?
Keep them.
They have holes in them.
- You okay?
- Yeah, fine.
Wait... there's more.
I work in real estate
but look where I live.
It's not bad.
Easier to keep warm.
Nothing in the fridge.
No big deal.
Want to go eat?
I'm not that hungry.
Want to wait a bit?
Turn around.
Turn around...
It supposedly happens often,
when you've wanted something
for a long time,
to feel disappointed
when you finally get it.
I'd won Abel almost without a fight,
and I already saw him differently.
He was there, near me,
he was mine,
a man like any other, in fact.
Like it?
It's delicious
Very good.
How is Marianne?
We don't see her anymore.
She's okay, I think.
Elections are soon.
She must be busy.
Yeah, I guess.
Enjoy.
Thanks a lot.
By my own fault,
I'd left my childhood for good.
I could tell.
Even my adolescence,
which I'd been unwittingly prolonging.
Yes, this time it was over.
Was my life coming to an end
with Abel?
Was I supposed to see him age
every day at my side,
for decades and decades?
Is what they say true?
What do they say?
That soon we'll be living
to like 100, 120?
I don't know
how we'll pay for retirement.
Or how to make love last.
If we get it wrong,
we'll have time to back out.
True.
It sucks I have no basement.
- I need to straighten up.
- I can do it.
I'll do it.
There's too much stuff.
Even for the sex, I can complain.
I had better orgasms with other guys
while thinking of him.
Now who do I think of?
For a while I thought:
"What if Abel doesn't come back?"
If he doesn't,
he doesn't really love me.
He lived with me out of convenience.
Supposedly that happens,
both for men and women.
Still not free one night?
Yes but I want to stay free.
All right. Have a nice evening.
At first,
Eve called all her friends
to keep them posted.
But after three weeks,
she kissed me on the cheek
and was happy with less sex.
I felt I was becoming cumbersome,
so I suggested we find a bigger place,
but she didn't like anything.
It needs a lot of work.
She seemed attached to her room.
It was her territory.
I called Marianne
a few times discreetly.
She didn't answer.
Or call back.
I tried not to think of them.
Once or twice, Eve had to leave Paris.
For family reasons, she said.
She left me alone in her studio.
I often wanted to call Marianne.
And I missed Joseph.
Oddly enough.
Joseph!
Him again?
Yes, maybe.
I had to go abroad for four days.
Did it go well?
I found Eve radiant.
Yes.
Did you eat?
No, I didn't. I'm hungry.
While kissing, she said:
It did me good to be alone.
It was great.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
You took it badly?
I didn't mean it that way.
She apologized afterwards,
but the damage was done.
You're so cute.
Let me check that.
She said she adored me,
but deep down,
maybe all she felt for me was curiosity.
I even wondered if she was unfaithful.
"Luxury at the court was costly..."
I understand, day after day,
how elegantly Marianne played her hand
so I'd think only of her.
"He wants to make them vote new taxes."
"Vote for", sorry.
Is Abel gone for long?
I don't know.
Just get out of school?
- How about a Coke?
- Sorry, I'm in a rush.
Can I walk with you?
Just a little.
All right.
You must be happy to be alone
with your mom.
I don't know...
You're not happy?
You're not alone?
Is there someone else?
You know the story with Abel?
No, what?
My mom sent him to you.
What are you saying?
She told him to go with you.
What do you know?
Here.
Listen. You'll see.
Yes, the heating was overhauled recently.
See you then, thanks.
I hope he didn't forget anything.
At least everything is clear now.
I just have to tell Marianne.
Since she won't answer my calls,
I'll go see her.
She must be at her office now.
- I'm looking for Marianne.
- So am I.
Okay, where is she?
The Senate or the Parliament.
- Why do you want to see her?
- I can't say.
Any message?
That's okay!
I'm a journalist.
I'm late for the session.
Go on.
It's now. I must tell her.
Come here! Stop!
I'm going to lose her!
We'll be there in 2 minutes.
Copy that.
What are you doing here?
Nothing.
Just waiting for you.
Do we talk about it or not?
Not.
So what do we talk about?
We don't have to talk.
Pivoine.
This way.
See?
Why did he say he was gay?
- I'll ask.
- Stop! You're crazy.
Do you ever still think I poisoned Paul?
Every day.
As your son would say...
I just need a motive.
Don't answer that.
All right.
Wait.
It's his school.
Really?
Today?
No, he didn't say anything.
I'll take care of it.
I'll keep you posted.
What is it?
Joseph disappeared.
- Does he know about us?
- Not yet.
- Where are we going?
- Hurry!
Have you seen Joseph?
My son. He comes here a lot.
Little Joseph, yes.
I wasn't in this morning.
John? Have you seen little Joseph?
No, not today.
Shall I call if I see him?
Wait, excuse me.
- We can report him missing.
- Wait.
Who are you calling?
Hello, Marianne.
Joseph?
I didn't think of that.
Thanks.
Come!
Thank you!
No, wait!
A FAITHFUL MAN
