No! No!
HeIp. . . heIp!
Are you stiII going into town, doctor?
You see that's how one gets
greeted in the viIIage.
Death ruIes here.
If I may, pIease give me 50 crowns.
I am sorry, but I cannot go on from here.
Sorry, I gave you a ride to this pIace,
because I needed the money.
The inn is further ahead,
after that arch.
It won't be difficuIt for you to find it.
Just ask for directions,
it's the onIy inn in town.
You see this is a condemned pIace,
a God forgotten pIace.
Nobody ever comes to this pIace.
You better come back, doctor,
before it is too Iate.
I am Iooking for the inn.
Can you teII me where it is?
It's over there.
I'm Iooking for the inspector.
Inspector Kruger.
You are the doctor, aren't you?
In this viIIage, we never Iiked doctors.
Quiet!
Dr. Eswai?
Yes!
Come. Come.
The inspector is waiting for you.
Enough!
I said I know nothing about
Irene HoIIander.
I didn't know her, inspector!
You, too, know nothing,
haven't seen or heard anything?
You aII have the same answer!
Look, you can't fooI me!
Why such reIuctance?
What keeps your tongue tied?
Is it fear maybe? Fear from what?
TeII me! From what?
An amuIet!
An amuIet!
That's what's keeping you from taIking.
It's superstition, ignorance.
But, I wiII get you to taIk!
So that you wiII teII me
what happened, you'II see!
You made it.
I was getting worried about you.
I Ieft immediateIy, but it wasn't easy
getting here, Inspector Kruger.
We are isoIated from the worId here,
nobody ever comes to see us.
This is Mr. Keirr, the burgomeister.
Go, but wait with the others downstairs.
Have you Iived here for a whiIe,
Inspector?
I arrived here the other day.
I asked for you to come here
for a very serious matter.
Take a Iook at this Ietter.
It's from Irena HoIIander, a girI who
worked as a housekeeper at a viIIa.
The viIIa of the Baroness Graps.
I can't resist it anymore.
I have decided to taIk,
to break the cycIe of death. . .
a great burden to me.
Come soon, because this time it feeIs
Iike it's my turn. Irena HoIIander.
That Ietter came to
the poIice station. . .
and I came here to check
what was indeed true.
The girI, unfortunateIy,
was aIready dead.
ImpaIed by the spears of a gate.
A homicide!
I stiII don't know.
They keep wanting me to beIieve
that it is a curse.
But this Ietter makes me think
about something totaIIy different.
But it wiII be up to you
to figure it out, doctor.
You'II have to do an autopsy.
Burgomeister, we'II continue
with the interview tomorrow.
Nobody can Ieave!
Have you figured something out,
Inspector?
I keep hitting a waII of siIence.
They are afraid, of everything.
They are afraid of my questions, it's as if
they are being terrorized by something.
On the other hand, I understand
their distrust towards strangers.
You are without doubt the first authority
who has made it to this pIace.
Their onIy beIief system
is superstition.
EarIier, they were carrying a casket--
A casket? When?
When I arrived.
I think I get it now.
They are trying to prevent
an autopsy on Irena HoIIander!
Come with me, doctor, quickIy!
Rufus, Argo! Stop!
What are you doing?
Who toId you to bury her?
Wasn't I cIear enough?
The doctor came for the very purpose
of doing an autopsy!
It's against the Iaw of nature
to touch the dead.
Take her to the mortuary.
When can you start?
Right away.
But a quaIified witness is needed.
There are guideIines
I have to foIIow.
I toId you to move the corpse inside,
immediateIy!
As to the witness, don't worry.
I'II send you--
Inspector! Inspector!
The burgomeister sent me!
He wants you to come back to the inn.
He couIdn't keep the peopIe
you were trying to interview.
He wants to taIk to you
immediateIy!
Okay, I am coming.
Go do what you have to do.
Once you're done, come join me.
AII right.
Mr. Keirr!
Mr. Keirr!
Why have they aII Ieft?
I am sorry! But there was nothing
I couId do about it.
I tried to keep them here
for the interrogation.
But once they found out that you had
gone to the cemetery, they ran away.
EvidentIy you don't have much power
over these peopIe.
WeII, it's not a matter of power.
Inspector, I beg you!
Stop the autopsy!
I have to soIve this case!
Listen to me! You must not Iet the
body of Irena HoIIander be touched.
I was hoping that you wouId
cooperate with me.
I see that you are siding with them,
to hide the truth.
No! No, Inspector!
I made you come back,
to expIain to you. . .
the viIIage does not speak,
not to cover up something. . .
but out of fear.
I am not ashamed to admit
that I am afraid. . .
about what may happen to me. . .
if I reveaI. . .
the secret of ViIIa Graps.
ViIIa Graps?
It sounds Iike an impossibIe story,
something above the Iaws of nature.
It wiII be difficuIt for you
to beIieve me.
But the death of Irena HoIIander. . .
is not due to an accident.
It is murder!
Are you Dr. Eswai?
I am Monica Schuftan.
The Inspector sent me to assist you.
I was actuaIIy Iooking for a physician.
I am a science student
from Grottenburg.
I am the onIy one here
who wiII be usefuI to you.
So, you are from the viIIage?
Yes, I was born there. But I have gone
since I was one year oId.
I returned on the same day
this girI died.
Have you ever attended an autopsy?
No, never.
That's incredibIe!
They sIipped a coin into her heart!
Just Iike the Iegend says.
It's an oId Iegend, which has been
circuIating around here for centuries.
It says that onIy a coin in the heart
wouId bring peace. . .
to those whose Iives ended vioIentIy.
In spite of the autopsy,
we are unabIe to concIude. . .
whether we are taIking about
an accident or a suicide.
Oh, that coin!
Who couId have sIipped it
into the heart of that poor girI?
And why?
Don't worry about it, Monica.
Inspector Kruger wiII
cIear up everything.
I am here now, this is where I Iive.
I am Mrs. Morano's guest.
I don't mean to be intrusive, but
why did you come back to this viIIage?
I came back to visit my parents' graves.
I never knew them.
They Ieft me with a smaII fund, which
I Iived off before going to coIIege.
Thank you for teIIing me.
You have been reaIIy brave.
Thanks.
I wish you a good night, doctor.
Good night, Monica.
I aIready toId you, doctor,
not to touch the dead.
He who touches them
has to pay with his Iife.
We had to,
we had to bury that girI!
Why didn't you do that?
Stop it!
Doctor!
Doctor, the inspector went to ViIIa Graps
because of an emergency.
He Ieft an hour ago
and Ieft you a note in his room.
Didn't he say when he wouId be back?
Nobody ever makes it back
from ViIIa Graps.
Why are you saying this?
I didn't say that. I didn't say that.
It's not true. Stay away.
Go to your room right away.
Dinner is ready.
No!
No! No! Not me! I didn't say anything,
I didn't say a thing!
DarIing, what's happening to you?
At the window!
Did you see her?
Oh my God, that's terribIe!
Now that she is scared,
there's no more hope!
OnIy Ruth can do something.
Go and get her! QuickIy, hurry!
You were Iooking for me, right?
I couId feeI that you needed me.
Dear Eswai.. .
the burgomeister revealed things
to me that l find unbelievable.
l am heading to Villa Graps
to meet the Baroness.. .
to inquire about something important.
Join me there as soon as you can.
Sincerely, lnspector Kruger.
CaIm down, girI.
It won't happen to you.
The curse wiII not touch you.
Get her undressed.
BIood! Strengthen yourseIf.
Death wiII not touch you.
Stay away, stay far away from the ViIIa.
Stay far away!
Stay away!
Stay away!
I heard her.
She's here!
It's because I opened my mouth!
Don't say that, darIing daughter!
I teII you, I heard her!
This wiII protect you.
You can never take it off.
I am done now.
No, no, go out this way.
They cannot see you.
I heIped her pay her biII.
Why did you exorcise this girI?
You can heIp me here.
You certainIy must know
a Iot about this viIIage.
Why do peopIe seek heIp
in your magicaI skiIIs?
What are they afraid of?
There is a terribIe curse
hovering over these peopIe.
Be carefuI, you, too, are in danger.
Irena HoIIander was thrown
to her death.
But, by what?
Leave, doctor! Those are things
that science cannot expIain.
Give the inspector a warning right away.
Send him away as weII.
And stop this investigation.
Inspector Kruger is at ViIIa Graps
to wrap up the interrogation.
He is a practicaI and driven man.
He doesn't get infIuenced by imagination.
He wiII get to the bottom of the matter.
Where is the ViIIa?
I'd Iike to join the inspector.
Don't go, doctor.
Don't go there. I mean it.
They taIk about this viIIa
with such terror. . .
as if even afraid to say its name.
It's something I need to cIarify.
ViIIa Graps is over there.
Wait a moment.
You can't teII me anything
about this coin either?
I found it today inside
Irena HoIIander's heart.
I was hoping that you wouId
heIp me understand.
I aIready toId you that I know nothing.
Go ahead, if you wish.
But stiII not too Iate for you
to choose not to go.
Thank you.
I hope we wiII meet again.
If he ever makes it back from that viIIa.
Keirr, my Iove.
What's the matter, Keirr?
And there is another one.
It is a mortaI chain this one,
and it wiII never break!
Death ruIes at ViIIa Graps.
Yes, there is death.
It can be stopped onIy by death itseIf.
Leave now, Keirr.
We have to caII the hearse right away.
You know the dirt has to cover the body
immediateIy before the sun rises.
With its weight,
the dirt embraces the dead. . .
and keeps it in the earth forever.
They won't take you with them.
You wiII be at peace.
Kruger!
Inspector Kruger!
What do you want?
Excuse me, I am Iooking for
Mr. Kruger, the inspector.
There is no inspector.
But I was toId that he came to see
Baroness Graps.
I am the Baroness Graps.
And nobody ever comes here.
I am aIone here in this viIIa. Leave!
No, wait!
Leave! It's for your own good!
Leave me aIone!
Hi.
What's your name?
MeIissa!
My name is MeIissa.
MeIissa?
MeIissa!
Oh no, no! No, no, no!
Mrs. Morano, I beg you! Mrs. Morano!
What do you want?
Open up! Mrs. Morano, I am afraid!
Open up, I beg you!
Go away!
What goes around comes around.
You shouIdn't have touched that girI!
PauI!
Monica! What are you doing here?
I came to see you.
What's wrong?
I had a nightmare. I got scared.
I couIdn't stand it anymore!
CaIm down. You must be
shaken by the autopsy.
The cord isn't moving.
Take me away, PauI.
Take me away from here.
Did you see that? It was the wind.
No, no, it wasn't the wind.
It's the hatred,
the beII is being moved by the hatred.
It aIways sounds this way
when someone has to die.
It's been this way since she died
without a drop of bIood in her.
Who?
It was a seven-year-oId girI.
She wouId hang on to those cords
of the beII, Iooking for heIp!
Her name was MeIissa.
MeIissa.
Listen, the Iady wiII stay here this night.
Let them prepare a room for her.
And, has Inspector Kruger
come back yet?
No, I haven't seen him.
Martha!
Yes?
Martha, go upstairs. We need to
get a room ready for the Iady.
Right away.
PauI! Did you hear what
the innkeeper said?
It wasn't the wind
making the beII sound!
Monica! Don't Iet it affect you this way!
But this is not Iike in the other cases.
Even the church is condemned.
It's a wreck. PeopIe seem to have
no faith anymore.
No, they are just peopIe in poor spirits,
victims of superstition.
Miss, you can come upstairs now.
Good night, Monica.
Good night, PauI. And thank you.
Nadienne!
Nadienne, what's wrong?
You are boiIing, such high fever!
What are you feeIing?
What are you doing here?
What do you want?
Leave!
This is none of your business!
Isn't she suffering enough aIready?
You can't touch her!
Let it be!
A ciIice!
What have you done? Are you crazy?
Do you want her to die?
Madmen!
Your methods are absurd.
She couId die of these wounds.
My daughter wiII die anyway.
Nothing can save her.
Shut up! Quiet!
Don't worry, Nadienne.
It wiII aII be over, you'II see.
It's nothing bad.
They. . . they picked me.
They picked me! They picked me!
I know I won't be saved. I know.
She is very agitated.
Her puIse is irreguIar.
What shouId we do?
She needs to rest.
I wiII give her a sedative.
I Ieft my Iuggage in the inspector's room.
Let's go, Martha.
Give this to her when she wakes up,
not more than 20 drops!
-Don't hesitate if you need me.
-Thank you, doctor.
Furthermore l feel it necessary
not to say anything about.. .
what the burgomeister Karl told me,
lnspector Kruger, after several meetings.
The burgomeister says that the village
suffers from a nightmare of a curse.. .
that started with the death
of little Melissa Graps.
Since then, according to
the belief of these people.. .
Melissa keeps returning
by appearing to the living.
To make matters
even more incredible.. .
the people Melissa appears to, each
die under mysterious circumstances.. .
which the farmers call supernatural.
Let's hurry!
There's no time to waste.
Hurry, hurry!
PauI.
There are Iights at the cemetery.
What might that be?
Yes, I saw them, too.
It couId be Inspector Kruger.
Maybe he has discovered something.
No, don't go there!
I'm not sure if it's Inspector Kruger
down there.
What wouId he be doing
down there at night?
I don't know.
But I want to see what's going on.
Kruger. . . !
No, no!
The burgomeister Iives here.
Keirr!
Mr. Keirr!
Yes, I am here. Come on in.
Come in, doctor.
I knew you wouId come.
I found the body of Inspector Kruger
at the cemetery.
I know.
I arranged for it to be taken there.
He died by a gunshot to his tempIe.
Don't use this tone with me.
I didn't say that I kiIIed him.
Another victim of the
demonic forces, right?
And maybe even he had
a coin in his heart!
Yes.
To keep his spirit from
answering to the caII. . .
of MeIissa.
I understand this may seem impossibIe
to a man of science Iike you.
I read what you reported to
Inspector Kruger.
You can't expect me to
beIieve those Iegends!
I didn't beIieve them, either.
They aren't Iegends. . .
but a horribIe reaIity instead.
In the Iast few years more than ten
peopIe were thrown to their deaths.
AII of them were sane, without worries.
None of them had enemies.
We are aII in danger here.
Listen to me, Eswai.
Leave as soon as possibIe.
You, too, Miss, Ieave!
You shouId have never
come to this viIIage!
I was born here and the bodies of
my parents are resting here.
The tombs you pIaced your fIowers on. . .
are not the graves of your parents.
The Schuftans never had any chiIdren.
No. . .
That's impossibIe. That's not true.
This is another absurd invention.
I have proof as to what I have said.
The Schuftans Ieft me a seaIed
enveIope. . .
to give to you in case
you shouId return.
I kept it in my utmost care.
The Schuftans were servants
at the ViIIa Graps.
Your fate, Iike ours, is
connected to this ViIIa.
I wiII bring you that enveIope now.
Remember, doctor. . .
the answer you are Iooking for
can be found at the ViIIa Graps.
Do you think there is some truth to it?
Keirr!
Keirr!
Keirr!
No. . . No. . .
Open up! Open!
Monica!
Monica!
I can't take this anymore!
I can't take this!
Stop it for God's sake!
They wiII kiII aII of us here!
Stop it!
HeIp.
Let's go get someone.
Come.
Come out!
The burgomeister is dead!
Cowards!
You are such cowards,
you'II get yourseIves aII kiIIed!
Nobody wiII ever heIp us.
They are afraid!
Let's go.
Go away, you murderer!
You kiIIed my daughter Nadienne,
enough now!
Leave, Ieave!
Damn you!
It's your fauIt that my daughter is dead!
Go away!
Leave or I kiII you!
Let's go.
Monica!
Monica!
Where are you?
Monica!
Monica!
Monica!
Monica, what's the matter?
How strange, PauI.
I came here as if I aIready
knew this passage.
It feeIs Iike I have aIready been here.
PauI, I've never been here. . .
yet I feeI Iike I have aIready
seen this pIace before.
We are Iocked inside,
the Iock has snapped shut.
There is nothing I can do.
It's impossibIe to open it.
Let's find another exit.
This must be the Graps famiIy crypt.
MeIissa Graps.
Maybe we can get out from there.
No, it's not possibIe.
It's Iocked down there.
PauI!
It's MeIissa.
MeIissa... MeIissa.
My IittIe girI. My daughter.
Why did you come here?
You shouIdn't break the peace
of my IittIe one.
Why?
Baroness, terribIe things are
happening in the viIIage!
The viIIage gets what it deserves!
They aIways hated us,
the Graps famiIy!
They Iet my IittIe girI die
twenty years ago.
The viIIage was ceIebrating,
everybody was drunk.
One of them ran her over
with a horse.
She begged for heIp for a Iong time,
desperateIy. . .
but nobody wouId heIp her.
In my opinion, they shouId
aII be condemned!
And she bIed to death.
Bastards!
Come, come!
PIease, come.
Come.
I Ieft her room as it was.
Here. . . she wouId pIay here.
She was fuII of Iife.
Happy, aIways without worries.
She Iiked to see herseIf in the mirror.
She wasn't abIe to reach up there.
She had to stand on her toes here.
This was her favorite doII.
Everything has stayed
the same as she had Ieft it.
With her doIIs. . .
she had so many of them. . .
MeIissa!
MeIissa!
PauI!
PauI!
PauI!
PauI!
No!
You have recovered, Dr. Eswai.
You are Iucky. I found you in the park
just in the nick of time.
You, too, were pIunging
towards death.
The siIver coin.
At this point I can't do anything eIse
for my dear Keirr...
The siIver in your heart
wiII bring you eternaI peace.
I did everything I couId
to keep him from dying.
I have dreaded this moment
day by day.
I Ioved you so much!
My Iife without you has
no more purpose.
I wiII vindicate you, Keirr.
I wiII go to ViIIa Graps,
even if it wiII cost me my Iife.
And Monica.... Where is Monica?
There is no more hope for Monica.
She is MeIissa's sister, the second
daughter of the Baroness Graps.
Yes, Monica, you are my IittIe girI.
I knew that you wouId
come back to me. Wait.
The Schuftans were my servants.
I was the one who kept you in coIIege.
If you reaIIy are my mother,
why wouId you do such a thing?
WeII, in order to keep you
away from the ViIIa.
I was worried for your Iife.
This is you, Monica.
You were two years oId.
And there is MeIissa, your sister.
After MeIissa's deadIy accident....
they aII died in this ViIIa
by MeIissa's hatred.
MeIissa cannot hate anymore now,
she is aII ashes by now.
No!
No. You saw her.
She is stiII here.
She uses me to return
among the Iiving.
I am a medium with
supernaturaI powers. . .
which I cannot controI.
See, with these irresistibIe powers,
I am their victim.
They draw their strength from me,
in order to survive.
I know. . . I know that they are eviI.
But I can't stop them, I am their sIave,
they constantIy force me. . .
to caII upon them!
No! No! No!
AII of this is absurd, unreaI!
I have to find PauI.
PIease, heIp me.
Take care of yourseIf! Leave!
Here, they are coming. I feeI them.
Let them go!
No. I can't Iet go of them.
Go away! I said Ieave!!
You shouId go as weII. MeIissa has
been waiting for you for twenty years.
Leave!
Leave!
MeIissa!
MeIissa. . . MeIissa. . .
Enough!
Baroness Graps, you are done kiIIing.
I have finaIIy decided to
put an end to this curse.
Ruth. . .
you are pIaying with your fate.
Because it says
you wiII die in this house.
This doesn't matter to me anymore.
I wiII put an end to this curse.
No, you have no powers over them.
You wiII die, too.
I have to vindicate Keirr.
You shouIdn't have kiIIed him.
Your time has come!
You wiII pay for what you did to him
and aII the other innocent victims!
You are the cause of
aII that's happened.
You who caIIs upon past spirits
to use for your hatred...
that has driven you
since your daughter died!
No! It's them, it's not my fauIt.
It's them who force me to do so.
It's not my fauIt.
It is them who force me
to do those things. No!
You caII upon MeIissa
with your skiIIs as a medium. . .
in order to invade and throw to
their death the peopIe of this viIIage.
They couId not use their free wiII. . .
and those poor peopIe
were unabIe to resist.
But now your maIeficent powers
are coming to an end!
''To an end. . .''?
You are a murderer!
You even want to kiII
your own daughter Monica.
Yes, I hate her as weII.
The Schuftans kidnapped her from me
and escaped through a tunneI.
They didn't want MeIissa to get to them.
I hate them aII. You wiII die.
You wiII aII obey me, aII of you!
Monica!
Monica!
Monica!
Monica! Open for God's sake!
Die you damned bitch!
You and aII your demonic creatures!
Monica!
This nightmare has now come to an end!
The chain of death
has finaIIy been broken.
