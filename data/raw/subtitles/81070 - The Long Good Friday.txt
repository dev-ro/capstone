Two large Bushmills please, darling.
Lads want another drink?
What about you?
Leave it out, will you?
- Get in.
- All right, all right.
Inside.
Harold will be well pleased.
- When is he back?
- Today.
Highly confidential.
I need them tomorrow,
for a council meeting.
No sweat. I'll get them photocopied.
And the Americans?
- I reckon they're coming.
- Good.
- About the nosh: on the corporation?
- Of course, councillor.
- See you, Jeff.
- See you.
Wait a minute!
Here's the plans, he needs them
back by this afternoon.
Good old George.
- Everything all right while I was away?
- Yeah.
The new casino has gone through.
- No problems?
- No, everything's all right.
Did anyone guess where I was?
Alan reckoned a health farm.
One or two rumours about New York.
- But nobody guessed?
- No.
Should have left 10 minutes ago,
I'm late for church.
I hate being late for church.
There you are.
Bye bye, have a nice Easter.
God rot your soul.
Oh, Christ, Harold, she's always worse
when she's going to church.
Mother's got really religious in her
old age, ain't she'?
Church three times a day.
It's Good Friday.
Have a Bloody Mary.
She thinks Paula is an angel
and I'm the devil in disguise.
Ah well, me and Paula have only
been divorced ten years, love.
Give her a chance to get used to it.
Cheers.
- Have you organised everything?
- Yes, it's coming along.
Charlie should be landing about now.
Here.
Maybe we should have gone
to the airport to meet him.
Nah, play it cool.
When the governor of Coca-Cola
drops in to London,
the Queen don't go dashing
off to Heathrow, does she?
- Queen?
- Well, you know what I mean.
All playing it up, right?
You went to school with Princess Anne,
played hockey with her, all that.
It's lacrosse at Benenden.
Hockey's frightfully vulgar.
Yes, yes, plenty of that, yeah.
The Yanks love snobbery.
They really feel they've
arrived in England
if the upper classes
treat them like shit.
Gives them a sense of history.
We'd better check
how the chef's progressing.
Ere, that geezer
don't half know about grub.
The smells that have been coming up
from the galley all morning
have been driving me potty.
You lay off the vodka.
Oi!
- Ça va?
- Ah, Madame, regardez-moi ça.
J'ai grands assiettes bleues
avec ces frises.
C'est ridicule!
Je veux des assiettes blanches
That's a right horrible ponce.
Well, he's French, ain't he?
C'est vraiment merveilleux.
- Nous remercions beaucoup.
- Merci.
Very nice.
These French geezers
really know their stuff, eh?
- That new?
- Bought 'em yesterday, 20 quid apiece.
I bet Harold was reluctant
to take the labels off, eh?
He broke two of them demonstrating
their exquisite delicacy.
He doesn't know his own strength.
Have you sorted out Immigration
for the Yank?
Yeah, Parky's dealt with that.
Then you may go and
have a drink on deck.
Hello mate, are you all right?
Having a good time?
Enjoy yourselves.
Councillors.
Excuse me a moment.
I won't keep him long.
Those plans came in very handy,
my son, much obliged.
No sweat, Harold.
The license on the casino,
that go through alright, no problems?
- A slight one.
- What's that?
Councillor Taylor seemed to think
you're a gangster.
Leave off!
What's the SP on the American?
Just pump him full of information,
everything you've got.
Instant planning permission,
all that sort of chat?
- Yeah, plenty of, er...
- Fine.
The Yanks think we're a crock-handed
corner shop over here, know what I mean?
Exude efficiency, right?
I'll tell him how quickly my
little enterprises are springing up.
- That should appeal, OK?
- Yeah, terrific, terrific.
Parky, you're not drinking?
Harold, you know I only drink
when I'm on duty.
- How's business, alright?
- A drizzle of complaints.
You get a lot of that in your game, eh?
- Hello, Dave.
- Hello, Mr Shand.
How are you?
Last time I saw you, you had spots.
Thanks very much!
Even I notice the coppers
are getting younger now.
- He's a detective sergeant now, Harold.
- Is he?
Celebration! Oi, come here.
- Champagne, my son.
- Thanks very much.
- Here's to you.
- Nice to see real friends doing well.
- Here's to real friends.
- Real friends!
Alright, George?
Jeff.
Won't be a minute, alright?
Keep your eyes on
the boys' behaviour, will you?
I don't want any of 'em
acting like delinquents.
No chance, they know it's important.
I told 'em to put
their wedding suits on.
I think you're gonna like Charlie.
So what's the plan?
A cocktail here
so we can clog the marina,
then off down the river so they can see
the scope of the whole project.
Terrific. Have you fixed the moorings?
Yeah, it's all under control.
Another thing...
Harris has got a lot of talking to do
this afternoon...
can you keep him off the booze?
Top him up with
Perrier water or something.
Harold, he's here.
You two pipe him aboard
and I'll be up, all right?
I can't believe you're here!
- The kid from New Jersey, eh?
- The boy from Stepney.
Charlie, have some champagne.
You should be the captain of this boat!
Great timing!
Listen I wanna propose a toast.
- Hands across the ocean, right?
- To the future.
To the future here, yeah?
Harold, I don't think you met Tony,
did you, when you were over there'?
- Tony who?
- Tony, my lawyer.
- Mr. Shand, Tony.
- Very nice to meet you.
Charlie, Tony, would you like
to come and meet some people now?
- Would that be OK?
- Good.
They're important, but they're nice.
Come on.
Keep your eye on that Tony.
He never said
he was gonna bring anybody.
They always come in twos.
Like the bailiffs.
Means they mean business.
Hi.
Hi.
"Happy are those
who are called to His supper.
"Lord, I am not worthy to receive You,
"but only say the word
and I shall be healed."
Oh, my God!
Ladies and gentlemen.
I'm not a politician.
I'm a businessman
with a sense of history.
And I'm also a Londoner,
and today is a day of great historical
significance for London.
Our country is not an island anymore.
We're a leading European state.
And I believe that this is the decade,
in which London
will become Europe's capital.
Having cleared away the outdated,
we've got mile after mile and
acre after acre of land,
for our future prosperity.
No other city in the world...
has got right in its centre,
such an opportunity...
for profitable progress.
So it's important that
the right people...
mastermind the new London.
Proven people, with nerve,
knowledge and expertise.
That, ladies and gentlemen,
is why you are all here today.
All trusted friends.
And why Charlie and Tony are here today,
our American friends,
to endorse the global nature
of this venture.
Let's hear it, ladies and gentlemen.
- Hands across the ocean!
- Hands across the ocean!
There used to be 80 or 90 ships
in here at one time.
They used to queue up to get in...
all the way from Gallions Reach
right the way down to Tilbury.
Used to be the greatest docks in
the world at one time, this.
Things change, Harold.
Don't get nostalgic.
Look to the future.
You realise you're
35 minutes away from Europe?
Great potential.
I live in a new country,
and I respect the past, but always
keep my eye on the future.
Don't touch, I'll take care of that.
You have a good sleep, Charlie,
we've got a tight schedule.
I want you to meet my property lawyers.
The best!
And then there's an accountant
who specialises in gambling tax.
This isn't a horse race.
Don't rush me, Harold.
Then there's someone
you have got to meet.
Harold, I said don't rush me.
I hate tight schedules.
I'll get everything covered that I
have to cover, but in my own time.
We're just docking now. It will be
nice and quiet if you want to sleep.
Come on, Harold.
Let's leave Charlie alone for a while.
Bad luck putting the hat on the bed.
Relax, he'll be alright.
Yeah, poor old sod is tired.
Look out for the boys in blue.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What?
Right.
This...
diabolical liberty.
What is it?
Blown up. He's dead.
Eric is dead. Car bomb.
Eh?
Mother's all right,
suffering from shock.
She's in the London Hospital.
I don't understand.
You need a million dollar computer
to understand this.
Who'd do such a thing, it's outrageous.
Outside a church...
you don't go crucifying people outside
a church on Good Friday.
- What's the matter, Harold?
- Eric's been blown up.
- A bomb?
- Yeah, in the Rolls.
- I don't believe it. When?
- Just now.
Mother's in hospital
suffering from shock.
I'm not surprised.
She went to church to say her prayers,
not to get blown up.
But why?
Someone trying to discredit you
in front of...
What, the Yanks?
No, nobody knew, did they?
- Well, they mustn't find out.
- They're sleeping.
Right, I want everybody in the
corporation working on this, fast!
And I want Colin here.
Where is he? He should have been here.
Where is he?
- He went swimming.
- Swimming?
He should have been here.
Right, I want everybody working.
Jeff, you get on the blower.
Razors, you round 'em all up
and you get 'em moving, fast.
Right, keep them on their toes because
I want this settled, tonight.
And you'd better see your mother.
Yeah, yeah.
Listen, if anyone hears anything,
anything at all,
I'll be at the Mayfair casino, right?
It's the work of a maniac.
I'll have his carcass
dripping blood by midnight.
More bad news.
Colin.
- Colin?
- Yeah.
Dead.
I did my national service with Colin.
We did six months
in the glasshouse together.
Two kids of 18, six months. They put us
right through it, the bastards.
Salisbury Plain manoeuvres.
Used to hump this bleedin'
great wireless about.
One winter, snow, blizzards,
freezing the bollocks off the ponies.
I got lost.
In them days you stayed lost,
until they nicked you for being AWOL.
And Colin, on a 24 hour pass,
he came out looking for me on his own.
It's lucky he found me or I
would've froze to death.
Yeah.
Colin never hurt a fly...
well, only when it was necessary.
It was always clean, wasn't it?
Never anything malicious about Colin.
- Why slice him up?
- On my grief.
Sorry, H.
Me and Colin was very close.
I've known him since we was at school.
What's going on?
They try and blow up me mum,
wipe out me best mate...
What are they trying to do?
Put the frighteners on me,
wind me up, what?
Harold,
I've kept it all incognito,
they're gonna collect the body
in an ice cream van.
There's a lot of dignity in that,
isn't there?
Going out like a raspberry ripple.
They're gonna store the body in the
freezer down the abattoir.
Alright, granddad.
Thanks for the call.
- Did anyone see anything?
- Not what happened,
the pool attendant found him but
I told her it was a haemorrhage.
- Good lad.
- Better close the bars, Harold.
No, open up, let 'em enjoy the holiday.
If you hear anything,
anything at all, you give me a bell.
Come on.
- Thank Christ you're here.
- Any news?
Colin's murdered.
- Colin's what?
- Dead.
- Where?
- In the swimming pool.
- Drowned?
- Don't be stupid, he did lifesaving.
What does it all mean,
a bomb in here and...
- A what?
- There was a bomb in the casino.
You'd better show us.
I wonder how it got disconnected?
Well the wire must have come loose
when Lou opened it.
Stroke of luck, though, wannit?
Last night...
Were there any peculiarities?
Usual crowd, regular punters,
nothing really.
What, no strangers?
A few Arabs, it was a good night,
nothing unusual.
Nothing unusual he says!?
Eric's been blown to smithereens,
Colin's been carved up,
and I've got a bomb in me casino,
- and you say nothing unusual?
- Well, you know what I mean, Harold.
Parky. Meeting King George V dock now.
He's put out a story the bomb in the car
was a gas leak. Buy us some time.
Nice one, come here.
There was nothing unusual
when I was in New York, was there?
No, nothing at all.
- Nothing alien?
- No.
How much did we pay
Parky last year? Twenty grand?
- More.
- Right.
Then he can start
earning his bloody money.
Who's having a go at me?
Can you think of anybody who might have
an old score to settle, or something?
Who's big enough to take you on?
Well there was a few.
Like who?
Nah, they're all dead.
Let's walk.
We can't have bombs going off, Harold.
We can't have corpses,
I had to stick my neck right out to keep
this out of the forensic blokes' hands.
Did you come up with anything?
Nothing.
I thought you were gonna tell me.
- What, no whispers?
- Not a thing.
Look at this place.
You know I once caught the pox
off some Indonesian bird here,
I was just a bobby on the beat then.
So this is where they're gonna build
the 1988 Olympic stadium?
Can you imagine nig-nogs doing
the long jump along these quays?
Stick a rocket up their arsehole,
they'll jump alright.
I want action on this, Parky.
The Yanks are clean,
we've checked them out.
You got to go down to
a third division messenger
to even come up with a sniff
of villainy with that lot.
How about Tottenham?
They can't even nick car batteries
without getting electrocuted.
- Some of the Clancy mob are out.
- Nah.
This is too accomplished for them.
Besides, no one's had
their teeth pulled out.
The spades?
Would they overlap?
I've never dealt in narcotics.
How do I know?
I don't know what they're after, do I?
I'll check it out.
I'm sorry about Colin.
I'll put him on
the missing persons list.
That should hold it off for a while.
Just as well, the commissioner
will be poking around.
Well, stall him.
We should have sorted this out
by this afternoon, I'm hoping.
We're looking forward to this this deal
of yours, Harold, with the Yanks,
the legitimisation of your corporation.
But we don't like fuss. Calm exteriors.
For ten years there's been no aggro
and it's all been down to you, Harold.
You've had it under control.
Now do yourself a favour
and get this lot under control
before the heavy mob is on you
like a ton of hot horse shit.
Give us that case.
Get that checked out, will you?
- What is it?
- It's the bomb from the casino.
Are you riding around
with a bleedin' bomb?
It's all right, it's been disconnected.
I'll get the bomb people
to have a look at it.
No Parky, get it checked out
privately, right?
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
I want the name of your top grass.
No way, Harold.
- I'll get more out of him than you can.
- That's true.
You do realise how much this deal
is gonna be worth in 1988, yeah?
Billions.
I'll cut in you in for a percentage
for the name of your grass.
- He trusts me, Harold.
- I trust you.
I've known him a lot of years.
Then you should remember
his name, shouldn't you'?
- If I give it to you...
- No ifs, Parky.
A percentage?
Erroll.
- Erroll the Ponce from Brixton?
- Yeah.
Can't trust nobody.
Did you hear all that?
- Yeah.
- Brixton.
Oi.
Which one's Erroll's house?
Never heard of him, man.
Razors, little bit of respect here,
I think.
Fucking hell!
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
I don't like people looking up
my nose when I'm talking to 'em.
He could have killed me.
The way it's been going today,
I'll probably get you
a cut-price funeral.
Now Erroll's house, which one is it?
Number 33.
This used to be a nice street, this.
Decent families, no scum.
Beauty and the beast. Blow his head off.
Hey...
Are you in training
or are you doing this for pleasure?
- We had a party last night.
- Booze, bints and pox, eh?
Harold, get him to take
that metal out of my earhole.
No, I'm disgusted. Shoot him,
let's put some muck on the ceiling.
Please! What do you want?
You seen anything of my Eric
flying past your window
about two hours ago, eh?
What are you talking about?
Come on, downstairs.
Down to the kitchen with you, my son.
I want verbals with you.
Put some deodorant on.
I'm heavily into personal protection.
Filth.
Is there no decency
in this disgusting world?
Here, while he's with us,
give yourself another prick.
Tell him what your name is.
Razors.
Otherwise known as Clapham Junction.
Or as the youth of today call him:
The Human Spirograph.
65 inches of stitching.
Now you're gonna feel
what it's like, boy.
And he was a very popular fellow.
Harold, what do you want?
Well...
I have it from a very reliable source,
that you know what's what,
and you have ears and I wanna
know what you've heard.
Look, am I supposed to know something?
Razors.
- What do you know about Colin?
- What about Colin?
I don't know nothing about Colin.
Look Harold, I've been here all night.
Look, what's up?
Someone's been playing
Guy Fawkes with my Rolls,
and a touch of Jaws in the lido.
That's what's up, mate.
What about Eric?
- Eric?
- You heard.
Well, he doesn't like Colin.
I mean, queers get
right up his hooter, you know?
After what happened this morning,
you'd have to find his hooter to get up it.
Is something up with him, then?
Well, let's put it this way:
apart from his arsehole being about
fifty yards away from his brains,
and the choirboys playing hunt the thimble
for the rest of him, he ain't too happy.
- Well, I haven't heard anything.
- Well, use your Scouse ears.
Listen, Erroll, the only decent grass
is the grass that grasses to me, right?
Harold, if I knew something...
Colin's been stabbed!
Well, his boyfriend used to
come hereto score,
but he never said nothing
so I know nothing.
I mean, a lot of people
come here to score,
but we sell very good shit.
Like you?
- Who's got it in for me?
- I don't know!
Cut him.
I still can't hear anything.
I don't fucking know!
Minded your car, mister.
You should've asked for the money first.
I could've slashed your tyres.
Here you are, go and get drunk.
Little acorns, eh?
From little acorns grow...
Exactly, that's how I started.
- Didn't we all?
- Not Jeff.
Busy getting himself an education,
weren't ya?
- Different generation, that's all.
- Billiard halls was my game.
Remember old Sammy? Sammy?
I tore up two of his tables in a week.
He used to pay me not to play.
What do you think?
Look, you told the Yanks
you control it here.
If they're sticking
that many million in it,
if they wanna test you do control it.
Nah, it's way off the mark. Leave off!
They might check books and finances
but they're not going to start
wiping out me firm, are they?
They don't want anarchy.
These people deserve something
better than this.
Not dog shit on the doorstep.
So nothing?
- Not a word, or no one's heard.
- No one's heard nothing?
That just ain't natural.
It's like one of them
silent, deadly farts.
No clues, and then pow,
you go cross-eyed.
We've asked all the usual.
Well maybe it's about time
you asked the unusual, innit?
Like who?
- All the chaps are out asking, H.
- What, you've given up?
- Where are they?
- Down the casino.
Well get them off their arses
and make them start again, right?
Go on, what are you waiting for?
- Have you heard from Parky?
- Not yet.
Eugene will phone
the minute he checks in.
- Razors is back with the car.
- Eh?
Dinner at the pub.
Oh, Christ.
You gotta entertain 'em a bit,
haven't ya?
You refreshed?
You bet, I'm ready
for your tightest schedule.
Nah, like you said, Charlie,
it's not a horse race. Relax, eh?
Sorry to hear the news, Harold.
Victoria was just telling us about it.
Yes, well she hasn't been well for a
long time, has she, Harold? Poor mother.
Don't worry, she'll be all right.
She's a fighter, you know.
But I had to spend some time
with her, you understand.
That's nice.
Well, shall we go? Dinner?
It's my favourite pub, Charlie.
You're gonna love it, I'm telling ya.
I bought this pub
about two years ago, Charlie.
To stop the breweries
turning it into a slum.
It's got real Old London character.
You'll love it.
That's nice.
I'll take the councillor in the Merc.
Oh, God help me.
Have you seen him drive?
You can always walk, sunshine.
Let me out!
Stand back! Stand back!
It might still be dangerous. Stay back!
- Are you all right, Pete?
- I'm all right.
What about your customers?
I don't know. I think they're all right.
It blew up there,
there was no one up there.
Jesus.
If we've been five minutes earlier...
Yeah.
What the hell's going on?
- Keep 'em there, Jeff. It's not safe.
- Yeah, alright.
- What is it?
- You go and help Pete, right?
Occupy 'em.
Anything that's necessary.
Just buy me some time, right?
Yeah, er... I'll take them to Justine's.
Terrific.
- Get Razors to book a table.
- Yeah.
- It was the gas.
- Gas?
This natural gas causes
dangerous leaks sometimes.
Harold wants us to go on
to a restaurant,
while he's dealing with it.
He'll join us later.
Jeff, stay with Harold, will you?
I'll drive.
Stand well back! Please stand well back!
There may be more explosions.
...need to get through.
Stand well back. Thank you.
Well, that French cook was taking
a lot of trouble, but this is ridiculous.
How'd they get in here
in the first place?
Ah, leave off, H.
You know how many people
come up here during the night.
What, nobody spotted nothing?
Nothing at all?
Nothing happened tonight, mate.
Mind you, a couple of days ago
two guys come up.
They wanted protection.
I thought they were comedians:
they had big hats, sunglasses,
I thought the agency sent them
down for cabaret.
Protection? Out on my boozer?
What, he actually made threats?
Yeah, I told 'em to piss off.
I took no notice of 'em.
- Much obliged.
- I'm sorry, mate, you know...
Didn't wanna worry you. Sorry.
Razors, come here.
Get on the trumpet.
I want all the corporation
at the Mayfair Casino
in half an hour. Right?
And I want 'em all there.
I don't want any excuses.
I'm gonna nail these bastards, right?
- You don't know who they are, H.
- Well we're gonna find out, aren't we?
It's getting dark.
People get frightened in the dark.
They talk, don't they?
Hello, Parky,
I'm afraid the dinner's
got a little bit burnt.
What did these comedians look like?
I don't know, H,
I've never seen them before.
They just looked like any other Micks.
Heavy Micks.
- Micks?
- Yeah, you know, Irish.
Quite hard looking Paddies.
I never dreamed
they'd do this, mate. I'm sorry.
Harold.
Irish, he said. Irish.
This is Special Branch, Harold.
It ain't normal villainy.
It's indecently abnormal.
That was meant for me.
It's serious.
Listen.
Check out all the Micks in the heavy mob
who are working on my manor.
I want names and addresses, right?
Will you listen to
what I'm trying to tell you?
- This is very serious.
- Oh, leave off.
It's just villains trying to
frighten their way into a few quid.
Harold, we're talking about bombs.
Two bleedin' bombs.
Did you get that one checked out,
by the way?
Still waiting for the report
Well, get a fucking move on.
Harold, if that bomb is Irish,
it's a different game.
Those boyos don't know the rules.
Names and addresses of the Micks, right?
Two or three Micks have been very busy,
covering a lot of ground here
since yesterday,
and not one of you lot
has turned up with a thing.
It's impossible no one knows nothing.
Someone, somewhere, knows. Right?
And we're gonna find him.
I want a top capture from every manor,
and I don't want no punters.
This is personal,
I want the man who knows.
Right. Who fancies what?
Well, me and Chris will take Soho.
We'll go and see Maltese Charlie.
A couple of drinks and he'll talk.
Use that, it's cheaper.
Remember, the license is in the post.
Well, I only use it to get the pigeons
off the caravan roof, don't I?
I don't want want none of you playing
Roy Rogers with this lot, right?
As soon as you've finished with 'em,
you give 'em back to Razors.
How about the Finsbury Park Hillbillies?
I like the singsong,
but who do you fancy for a lullaby?
- Well, Chopper's in the boob.
- Harry and Pinchers?
- Both of 'em?
- Why not?
They're like Siamese twins, them two.
Pick 'em up together,
then split 'em apart.
We'll interfere with
their telepathy, right?
Has anybody seen the Major lately?
I heard he's a sick man. Bedridden.
It will make a nice change for him,
a night out. Eh?
Right, arm up and get going.
And use the butcher's truck, right?
Me and Razors will take the trip
to the Elephant and Castle.
- Where do we meet?
- Two hours from now at the abattoir.
And remember: scare the shit
out of 'em but don't damage 'em.
I want 'em conscious and talkative.
And lads...
try and be discreet, eh?
I think we'd be employing
your talents better
if you went to help Victoria
with the Yanks.
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah.
Do you reckon...
Colin was jealous of you?
Come again?
Well, I was trying to ease him out,
you know how potty he could go.
So?
Well, is Colin the reason for all this?
You know how bitchy queers get
when their looks start fading...
I don't know, he wasn't my type.
- How do you stay so cool?
- I'm on the winning side.
Yeah.
- Help Vicky out, right?
- Yeah.
But I want you at the abattoir
by midnight, right?
All right.
Thank you, Ricardo.
If I knew Mr. Shand
wanted this table tonight...
Well there was a change of plan.
You can say that again.
Would you care for a drink
before you order?
Charlie?
- Yeah, bourbon on the rocks.
- I'll have the same, please.
A screwdriver, lots of vodka.
San Pellegrino for me, please.
I think we should skip
the flambé cooking,
considering the gas situation in London.
That sort of thing doesn't
happen twice in one day.
You should level with us.
We're not just a pair of jerks
out of college, you know.
No, absolutely not.
Two bombs, that affects everyone.
Let's order, shall we?
Soupe du jour and the chef's special.
I'll have my usual.
No soup, hors d'oeuvres and the special.
I'll have the same.
So Charlie, how did you
know about the bombs?
It's our business to know these things.
And Ricardo,
a bottle of champagne, very cold.
Harold has got bad problems.
- But he's dealing with them right now.
- He's been dealing with them all day.
- He's very thorough.
- I like your loyalty.
I'm being frank.
Victoria, unless you tell us
what Harold's bad problems are
and how he's dealing with them,
I'm gonna tell you what we're gonna do.
Tony and me,
we're gonna leave the table,
we're gonna check out of the Savoy,
grab the first plane home.
There will be no deal.
It's not a good idea
to bullshit us, Victoria.
Cheers.
Well?
A car was blown up,
then a bomb was found
at the Mayfair Casino.
It hadn't detonated.
One of our men was found
dead in a swimming pool.
Yeah, he was stabbed.
I'm giving Charlie
all the essential details.
Well, I think that is
an essential detail.
Auto, casino, stabbing,
a bar blown up...
- What is this, a gang war?
- No, no question.
Then what?
Isn't it obvious, Charlie? This deal
is very big, someone is envious.
Harold and I have no doubt that
by tomorrow the problem will be settled.
- You sound very confident.
- I am.
Tony, you're the lawyer.
Tell me what you think.
I think we can afford to give you
24 hours to resolve your problems
before we make a final decision.
OK, Victoria,
I'll give you till tomorrow.
But just one more foul-up and
we're on our way back home.
That goes without saying.
Nothing personal, Victoria,
but business is business.
I understand.
Harold, what are you doing
this side of the river?
You're straying a bit, aren't you?
How's it going, Billy, all right?
- Scotch?
- Sorry to hear about your mother.
Car blew up, didn't it?
That's what I heard.
What's up, Harold?
You got a spot of bother?
No, no.
The music's loud in here, innit?
- I'll get him to turn it down a bit.
- No, listen, Billy.
I've got a little bit of business
I want to drop your way.
Can we talk in the other bar?
- Right.
- Nice one.
Jimmy, bring the drinks around the back.
I heard about this
American number, Harold.
If there's anything going, put me in.
Well, the thing is, Billy, there's
plenty of money for everybody,
I just need the right people,
you know what I mean?
Well I'm your man, you know.
Walk to the car, Billy,
or I'll blow your spine off.
It's not a shooter is it, Harold?
Oh, don't be silly, Billy.
Would I come hunting for you
with me fingers?
It's all gonna happen,
with or without Harold.
My hotels are gonna be there!
Will you get us a cab to the Savoy?
I'll show you the plans tomorrow.
Magnificent.
High in the sky hotels,
well, you know what I mean.
Something to be proud of.
Yes, well I think it's time
we all went home, don't you?
No, come on, Victoria.
Charlie understands.
You understand, don't you, Charlie?
We're two of a kind, me and him.
We've had to claw our way
out from the gutter.
We're self-made men, right, Charles?
I don't think Mr. Restivo is as familiar
with the gutter as you assume.
If you don't watch your fucking step,
councillor, you'll be right back in it.
Come on Vicky, don't be like that.
I'll tell you what...
we'll have some more brandies
at the bar, eh?
And I'll tell you
all about my plans, Charlie.
Don't be hostile, Vicky.
- Jeff.
- Hello Jeff.
Charlie.
Tony.
- Everything all right?
- You tell me...
I've put our American friends
in the picture about today, Jeff.
Oh, then you'll understand
why Harold couldn't make it.
It's all under control.
Oh, I'm sure Harold Shand
can find a way out of this one.
Meantime, I'm going to have a piss.
Stay right where you are, folks.
- That guy's a loudmouth.
- I don't like drunks.
Do you trust him?
Harold can handle him.
A city councillor is a very wise
investment at the moment.
We'll talk about that tomorrow.
Good night, Victoria.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
- Good night. Thanks for the dinner.
- Good night, Charlie.
Good night.
Oh, Christ, am I pleased to see you!
That bloody Harris is a liability.
Any news?
No, not yet.
Where have the Yanks gone?
I've just bought some more brandies.
Go home, Harris. Go home.
Don't look down
your nose at me, Victoria.
It makes you go cross-eyed.
You can't even see that
I'm not the real bastard. He is.
Aren't you?
I'll get you a cab home, councillor.
I'll talk to you later.
OK.
Bastard.
God, I don't think I've ever been
so pleased to see anyone in my life.
It's been a hard night.
You did a good job.
Without the helpful Councillor Harris.
He fancies you, you know...
then a lot of people do.
Must be my sparkling personality.
I'll see you to your door, just in case.
Thanks.
If you miss it, it's unlucky.
It won't move unless
you press the button, you know.
It's not moving.
It's temperamental, I'll do it.
I hate lifts.
Gets really claustrophobic in here
with a lot of people.
Depends on the people.
I wanna lick every inch of you.
Saved by the bell. Good night.
Bastard.
It's a long time
since I've been to a funeral.
That's a strange thing.
Did Jeff tell you about the funeral
the day you got back?
A funeral every half hour
down the East India Dock Road.
A woman got out of the funeral car
and gobbed at him.
- Eh?
- I didn't see it properly, H.
I didn't crack on.
You're gonna love this here.
You're gonna love this.
Shut up all of ya!
For more than ten years
there's been peace.
Everyone to his own patch.
We've all had it sweet.
I've done every single one of you
favours in the past.
I've put money in all your pockets.
I've treated you lot well.
Even when you was out of order, right?
Well now there's been an eruption!
It's like fuckin' Belfast
on a bad night.
One of my closest friends
is lying out there in the freezer.
And believe me, all of you.
Nobody goes home
until I find out who done it, and why.
Harold, believe me, if I knew I'd say.
The last thing I want is any trouble.
- Everything's going too well for us.
- You lying bastard.
Am I? Look, things have never been so good
between South London and the East End.
You bastard. You rotten bastard.
Course he knows!
- Get him out of here.
- Bastard!
Oi! Jeff, you behave yourself!
Right lads, it's your decision.
Frostbite or verbals,
one of the two, right?
- What's the matter with you?
- Listen.
Listen.
If you kill him,
we've got gang war on our hands, right?
We already have.
They're walking all over you.
That's 'cause we ain't got no lead!
Parky. About time.
- Well?
- You've got to drop it Harold,
it's not that lot.
- I've had the bomb checked.
- And?
It's the same sort of device
the IRA use.
This is Special Branch now, Harold.
I'm turning it over to them.
What do the Irish got to do with me?
It's just a bunch of hoods
trying to muscle in.
For Christ's sake, Harold,
they're not just gangsters.
They run half of Londonderry on terror.
Could be London next.
Oh, no, I run London.
Not now, Harold, they're
taking it away from you.
It's Special Branch now,
and I'm getting out.
Remember who pays your wages, Parky,
you ain't going nowhere.
Now, tell me something worthwhile.
There was a robbery at Councillor
Harris's demolition yard, explosives.
We pulled in the security guard, Flynn.
We grilled him for hours,
but he just wouldn't crack,
he was too scared.
Alan, check out this geezer Flynn,
bring him in.
Harold, you can't do that!
Don't you ever tell me
what I can or can't do.
Bent law can be tolerated for
as long as they're lubricating,
but you have become definitely parched.
If I was you, I'd run for cover
and close the hatch,
cause you're gonna wind up on one of
those meat hooks, my son.
Right, let 'em go,
they don't know nothing.
Jeff, clean 'em up and get them home.
Give 'em a grand each expenses,
just keep 'em sweet.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna go home,
I need some time to think.
Alan, first thing in the morning,
that security geezer, right?
Razors, come on, son.
Dave, do as he says,
put 'em in a bubble bath.
- Eh?
- You heard.
Come on, lads, let's be having you.
How did it go with Charlie?
Well, I stopped them going home.
Going home?
Yeah, they were going home.
They're not stupid.
They knew it was a bomb,
and now they know the rest.
- How?
- I told them.
- You did what?
- I told them everything, Harold.
I had to.
Victoria,
listen sweetheart,
I'm setting up
the biggest deal in Europe,
with the hardest organisation
since Hitler stuck a
swastika on his jockstrap.
I've been to incredible lengths
all day to keep it incognito,
and now you, over a sherry,
calmly tell the whole story.
I had to tell them everything
or the deal would have been finished.
Harold, your trouble is you just
don't understand their psychology.
Bollocks, you smart-arsed prat.
I can't talk to you.
I'm going to bed. Good night.
Come here! I'm talking to you!
Don't treat me like one of your thugs.
What's happening to me?
I'm sorry.
For ten years it's been calm,
no trouble.
And now this.
Listen, I wouldn't hurt you
for the world. Come here.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm so scared, Harold.
I don't want to die.
Don't let them kill us.
Alright.
It's alright.
It will be alright, believe me.
What is it, boy?
For Christ's sake...
Help me.
Hurry.
I'm sorry, H.
It's alright, Alan it's not your fault.
You weren't to blame.
There's some fresh coffee
in the kitchen.
Go and make yourself some breakfast.
Ta.
So someone got to him before you could.
How did they know?
- Or was it a coincidence?
- That's stretching it a bit, innit?
That means it's someone close to home.
You know, last night in the restaurant,
I had a funny feeling.
Harris... being really strange.
He said something to Jeff,
just as we were leaving.
He said that I'd got it all wrong,
that Jeff was the real bastard.
Why should he say that?
Hello, Razors?
That funeral you told me about,
something about
a bird gobbing in Jeff's face.
That's right.
Well, find that woman.
I wanna talk to her.
Well, get her name and address
off the undertakers.
How do I know? I wasn't there, was I?
Look up the Yellow Pages.
There can't be that many
undertakers in the area.
Right. And as soon as you've found her,
come and pick me up.
Right. I'll see you. Ta-da.
Mrs. Benson?
You're a bastard, Harold Shand.
A vicious bastard.
You deserted him,
and left him to die in a stinking ditch,
and you didn't have the decency to...
- When did he die?
- Ten days ago. You should know.
Where?
Belfast.
Belfast?
- What was he doing there?
- That Jeff Hughes sent him.
- What?
- He was hired.
The blond one, that Colin,
always asked him
to do the chauffeuring on the long runs.
- To chauffeur?
- A minicab.
Your husband drove Colin...
and he got topped in Belfast?
He was left there.
I was left with all the arrangements,
to bring the body back here...
and not so much as a penny
for me and the kids.
And Jeff Hughes hired him?
Yes.
And that bastard hasn't
paid me any compensation.
All right, all right, all right.
You'll get some compensation,
the corporation will look after you.
- Is there anything you need?
- I'll need a hundred quid a week.
Alright.
Anything else you want?
I just want him back.
Get him a decent stone.
Send me the bill.
- Drink?
- Yeah.
- Do you ever worry about your liver?
- No, we're just good friends.
My mum used to have a go at
my old man about his boozing,
and he always used to say:
"If you drink less than your doctor,
you're all right."
It's hot in here, shall we go on deck?
Hot?
Are you hot?
This'll cool you down.
What did you want to talk about?
Shouldn't we be, well...
with all what's going on...
Everything's alright.
Alright?
I'm using the word the way you use it.
What?
Alright?
I remember vividly when you met me at
Heathrow off the plane from New York,
I said "How's things been?",
and you said "Alright".
- I'm not with you.
- Aren't ya?
Top-up?
Quite frankly,
I'm a bit flabbergasted...
you forgot to mention this carry on
in Belfast while I've been away.
Ah, that.
Yeah, that.
What about this minicab driver,
Phil Benson?
He's...
Well, he was a friend of Colin's.
He got killed.
It's a long story.
- I know I should've told you, but...
- Well, tell me now.
What the bloody hell was Colin doing
with a Limehouse
minicab driver in Belfast?
Colin can't drive.
Ah, that makes sense.
Second question:
Belfast, what was he doing there?
I know Colin fancied soldiers,
but that's taking his buggering
a bit far, innit?
- He had to make a delivery.
- A delivery of what?
Come on, I'm curious!
What, Chieftain tanks, bars of
chocolate, Fiesta Durexes, what?
Money.
What, ain't they got
any banks out there?
Well, what money, what for and who to?
He was delivering for Harris.
He had a problem.
He was being leant on to deliver,
to deliver money, I mean, to Belfast.
Leant on by who?
He's got 100 Micks on his labour force,
he's out of business without them.
He was being leaned on to
organise a delivery. He asked me.
So you got my Colin to deliver
for Harris money to Belfast?
Yeah.
Well, that is irregular.
I don't approve of my men
delivering funds for the IRA.
He had no choice.
He has to do what they ask.
Otherwise his buildings don't get built.
That's why he never has a strike.
That's why we use Harris.
Jesus Christ!
Of all the faces here you could
have used, of all of them...
you have to pick Colin
for a job like that?
So he took a dip, yeah?
Yeah, he stupidly helped himself.
How much?
- Five grand.
- Do what?
You mean all this anarchy
is for five poxy grand?
And three of their top men
were wiped out.
The night Colin delivered.
So they put two and two together
and come up with the answer, ain't they?
'Cos Colin's my man, it's down to me.
I'm the one that's
grassed them up, aren't I?
This is all revenge.
Yeah.
Revenge.
I'll fucking show them.
That security guard, he could
give us a clue, couldn't he?
- Did he say anything?
- Nah, not much when Alan got to him.
No?
Nah, Alan found him dying.
He'd been nailed to the floor.
When was this, then?
It must have been just after you
saw him and before Alan saw him.
Otherwise you'd have noticed,
wouldn't you?
I mean a geezer nailed to the floor,
a man of your education would definitely
have spotted that, wouldn't he?
Now look...
Traitor! Fucking Judas!
I didn't do nothing.
Maybe you didn't nail the geezer, but
it's down to you all the same, isn't it?
- It had nothing to do with me.
- Don't lie to me, boy,
I can smell your lies
and I can smell something else and all,
I can smell your greed and ambition,
and something disgusting like betrayal.
Why, Jeff?
Why?
He threatened to kill me, I was scared.
- You put the finger on me, didn't you?
- I didn't. It was Harris.
For Micks, pig-eyed Micks,
redneck terrorist scum.
Don't blame me, blame Colin.
Revenge?
It's me who's gonna take revenge.
I'll crush them like beetles.
- Never.
- You watch, I'm gonna annihilate them.
- You can't wipe them out.
- You just watch me.
Kill ten, twenty, bring out the tanks
and the flamethrowers,
They pour back.
It's like an army of ants.
Work with them.
- It's my manor!
- Jesus Christ.
The British Army has been diving about,
with shit flying at 'em from all angles,
for the last ten years,
and you're not impressed?
Shut up.
They can take over here
any time they want.
- Just shut up.
- You won't stop them.
To them you're nothing, nothing,
the shit on their shoes.
Jeff...
He was with Harris.
He's done me over.
I'm gonna kill him.
Razors!
Gimme that fucking gun!
- Razors!
- Harold!
Take it easy.
- Calm down..
- Give me the gun.
You've got Harris, right?
You've got him.
Now you use him. You use him to stop
this bloody havoc, right?
- Councillor Harris's office please.
- Yes, sir. I'll show you the way.
- Thank you.
- He's on the second floor.
- A friend of yours, sir?
- Yes, a very old friend, yeah.
Nice man, Councillor Harris.
And a hard worker.
Been on that bloody phone all afternoon.
Has he?
He's done a lot for the Irish
community round here, has he?
So they tell me, yes.
Do you know, it's three weeks
since they turned over
the pages of the Book of Remembrance?
There's a work to rule.
I said to the union bloke,
I said it's a good job they didn't
work to rule in 14-18
in the trenches in France.
- Is this it?
- The very same.
Are you gonna need me to
show you the way down again?
No, I think I can manage. Thanks a lot.
Harold.
How unexpected.
Harold, call it off!
You can't do it.
You can't deal with these people.
For Christ's sake,
they're not interested in money.
They're political, they're fanatics!
Come on, George.
Come in.
O'Flaherty, Harold Shand.
There's 60 grand here.
To make sure there's no more aggro.
We'll have to wait
and see the boss about that.
Where is he?
He's out there.
He just won the last race.
He'll be back in a minute.
This is Mr. Shand.
He's brought the money
and he wants an answer.
- How much is that?
- 60 grand, it's in the case.
You'd better count it.
If you don't mind, I will.
You wait here. I'll go and get 'em.
All right? I won't be a minute.
Mr. Restivo, please.
Where's Charlie?
Everything's alright.
All the troubles are over.
What did he say?
Sorry, Harold.
But I'm glad you dropped in
to say goodbye. That's real nice.
- What, are you leaving?
- Yeah.
- You're not going back to New York?
- Next flight out.
'Ere, come on, Charlie!
I know we've had a few problems,
but you've only been here a couple of days.
Yeah, a couple of days
that turned out to be
another St. Valentine's Massacre.
But that settled it, once and for all.
Yes, I'd like a porter
to suite 513 please,
and we'd like a cab right away.
Thank you.
You two can't wait
to get out of here, can you?
I always react like that to bombs
blowing up, mass murders...
It's a hang-up of mine.
It's coming to something when the Mafia
can't handle a little problem, innit?
A little problem?
Tony did you hear what he said?
A little problem...
Harold, this is like
a bad night in Vietnam.
But it's over,
I've pulled the plug on 'em.
We do not deal with gangsters, period.
This country is a worse risk
than Cuba was.
It's a banana republic. You're a mess.
Ciao, Harold.
Bon voyage, then.
I'll tell you something...
I'm glad I found out in time
just what a partnership
with a pair of wankers like you
would've been.
A sleeping partner's one thing,
but you're in a fucking coma!
No wonder you got an energy crisis
your side of the water!
But us British, we're used to
a bit more vitality, imagination,
touch of the Dunkirk spirit,
know what I mean?
The days when Yanks could come over here
and buy up Nelson's Column,
a Harley street surgeon and a couple
of Windmill Girls are definitely over!
Now look...
Shut up, you long streak
of paralysed piss.
What I'm looking for is someone
who can contribute
to what England has given to the world:
culture, sophistication, genius.
A little bit more than an 'ot dog,
know what I mean?
We're in the Common Market now,
and my new deal is with Europe,
I'm going into partnership with a German
organisation. Yeah! The Krauts!
They've got ambition, know-how,
and they don't lose their bottle.
Look at you...
The Mafia?
I've shit 'em.
Here, hold up, where's Victoria?
