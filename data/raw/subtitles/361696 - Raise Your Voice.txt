Have a very pleasant
summer everyone.
Ms. Fletcher, rehearsal tomorrow
at 4:00.
Oh, and I did send in that
recommendation you requested.
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Holcombe. Bye.
Are you actually
going tomorrow?
Call me a dork,
but I love choir practice.
And I don't want
to let him down.
All right, last day!
- Hey, Terri, hey, Terri.
- Hey, Matthew.
Hey.
I, uh, I got the concert tickets
that you wanted.
Oh, um,
I've got the money.
- Awesome.
- There you go.
So, um,
I'll see you
at rehearsal then.
Okay, cool.
See you then
Okay.
Oh my God!
He's going to spend
the whole next month
hoping he didn't just
get you pregnant.
Oh, shut up.
He's so nice.
!" Play it loud!"
!" Play it loud!"
!" Raise your voice!"
!" Shout it out!"
!" We weren't the first!"
!" But we're
holding our own...!"
As hordes of summer-starved teenagers
descend on unsuspecting  Flagstaff, Arizona,
Iet's see what these two
poised young women
have to say about
the last day of school!
- I'm outta here, Riverdale!
- Yeah, school's out, baby!
All right.
The camera loves you.
So, Lauren, what are
you doing tonight?
Paul, stop hitting
on my friend.
Whatever you're
doing tonight.
Lauren, stop hitting
on my brother. Ugh!
Hey, would you tell Mom
I'll be late?
But it's your graduation
barbecue.
I've got places to go, people to see.
Just save me a burnt burger.
- Will you give me a ride home?
- Sure.
- Thanks, Lauren.
- Anytime.
- Hey, I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay, have fun tonight.
So, T erri Boo-berry,
what are you up to this summer?
- I'm singing in choir.
- Cool.
Yeah, and, um, I'm working
at the restaurant again.
- Wow, what fun.
- Yeah.
But mostly, I really want to get into
this music summer program in August.
- Really, which one?
- Some music thing in L.A.
Dad! Come on! It's not
just some music thing in L.A.
It's Bristol-Hillman
Music Conservatory.
Only the best summer music
program on the West Coast,
- maybe even in the whole country.
- T erri, don't start.
But Dad, this is
so important to me.
Plus, I already sent
in my application and I sent a CD
- because Mom said I could.
- That's it! You're not going!
- Simon, don't be so closed-minded.
- Nina, please.
Terri...
- Where've you been?
- Hanging out with some of the guys.
Saying goodbye, that stuff.
Hey, Aunt Nina!
- Happy graduation.
- Thanks.
- Here.
- Oh here, I'll take it in.
Hey, what's wrong?
Terri just wants to go
to this great music program in L.A.
and your Dad's being his usual
squash-any-good-idea self.
Nina, the prettiest girls
from all the high schools go to L.A.
You know what happens to most of them?
- Dad, you don't think Terri's special?
- Paul, seriously.
I think she's the most special human being on the planet.
She's my girl.
That's why she's
not going to L.A.
She's 16, for God's sakes.
What's wrong with you people?
Hundreds of people
apply for this.
If she gets in, it's proof she belongs
there, but you get that, right?
Look, when I was your age,
I thought I knew everything too.
But I've seen a lot more of the world
than you have, Paul.
What parts of the world
have you seen, Dad?
The back and front
of your dad's restaurant?
Okay, okay.
Paul, that's enough.
Well, just because you're stuck
here, you want everyone stuck with you.
You better watch your mouth
or you're gonna get grounded.
All right, listen.
Can we please stop fighting?
It's a graduation party.
We're suppose to be celebrating here.
All right?
I can't get
these damn coals to light.
- Oh, well here, try this.
- What are you doing?
God. Stop. That's it!
You're grounded! Get in the house.
- I just love our family get-togethers.
- Uh, I'll be back.
Always have.
So...
I never got a chance to tell you
congratulations on Arizona State.
Thanks.
At least I'm getting outta here.
Aunt Nina, if Terri gets
into that music program,
you gotta make sure
she goes.
- She'll suffocate staying here.
- Yeah, I know.
I was thinking
the same thing.
So you're on my side?
Always.
Hey.
What's going on?
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
Yeah, right.
!" There's a light in me!"
!" And it's shining bright!"
!" I can almost
touch the sky...!"
The sky.
!" You're the reason
I believe...!"
Hello, annoying.
Hey! Easy on the hardware.
What are you doing?
Filming America's most boring teenagers?
!" And I feel so strong...!"
Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight on "The Fletcher Experience,"
we have a special treat.
It's my sincere pleasure to present
to you the distinctive vocal stylings
of the one, the only,
T erri Fletcher!
Oh, well, Paul, that is
so very kind of you. Thank you.
This next song
I wrote for my fans.
!" Something's got
ahold of me!"
!" But I will follow
where you go!"
!" One more mile to Jericho!"
!" The walls will tumble!"
!" The walls will tumble--!"
!" The music fills the space!"
!" And it takes the pain away!"
!" And I know
it's gonna be all right.!"
!" When you're sad and lonely!"
!" Tell Him what you want!"
!" Hold Him up and tell Him
what you want.!"
!" 'Cause I just can't wait
till you write me!"
-!" You're coming around!"
-!" Around!"
!" Now I'm walking
on sunshine, whoa-oh!"
-!" And don't it feel good,
-!" Oh, yeah, now!" !" And don't it feel good...!"
" Oh--!"
Hey, what are you
doing here?
With all the stuff
that went on this afternoon
I almost forgot to give you
your graduation present.
- Three Days Grace?
- Yes.
Oh my God! When?
It's tonight.
Oh, no.
Didn't you hear
I was grounded?
Paul. Come on.
It's not like you never break the rules.
If you don't go,
I can't go either.
Please.
It's Three Days Grace.
- Side window? Should we go?
- Side window.
All right.
Quiet, quiet!
I can't believe
you sprung me.
This is a first.
Well, who know when we'll ever
break the law again, right?
I'm not, uh, staying
in Flagstaff Terri.
I lined up a job in Phoenix
and I'm going straight to Arizona State.
I'm not coming back.
Just like that?
I mean...
It's time.
Dad and l...
need...
It's just time.
The only thing I feel bad
about is leaving you here.
No. You don't have to worry about me.
We get along okay.
Yeah, that's what
worries me.
It's more than getting along, T erri.
You please them.
You're like a Stepford daughter out
of a mail-order magazine.
Is that
a form of flattery?
After Dad slammed you
on Bristol-Hillman,
you're going to tell me
that didn't hurt?
- No, it totally hurt.
- Then make a scene!
Break something! Scream!
I... something.
Huh-huh. Tantrums were
never my thing.
Terri, you've got the best
voice I've ever heard,
but if you hang with the "World
According to Simon Fletcher" any longer,
you're going
to be doing "Cats" at the Y at 40.
And that would suck.
That would suck.
!" Home!!"
!" This house is not a home...!"
What's up, Flagstaff?"
How you guys doing
all right?
-!" Are you ready for this?!"
- Paul, don't-- oh my God.
!" Sit down!
!" Are you ready for this?!"
!" Shut up!!"
!" Are you ready for this?!"
!" Stand up!!"
!" Are you ready?!"
!" This game!"
!" Are you ready?!"
!" Are you ready?!"
!" Are you ready for this?!"
!" Sit down!"
!" Are you ready for this?!"
!" Shut up!"
!" Are you ready for this?!"
!" Stand straight!!"
!" Are you ready?!"
Paul, Look out!
!" Are you ready for this?!"
Oh! Thank God.
Paul?
No.
Healing nicely.
Still got that headache?
Can you tell me
your birthday?
April 20th.
Let's let T erri
get the next one.
Tell me what month it is.
- June.
- What's wrong with her?
Why can't she speak?
Terri, tell me what month it is out loud.
It's June.
That's good.
Now follow this light
with your eyes.
Doc, stop!
Whatever you're doing, just stop.
I wish I was older.
I'm so afraid I'll say something stupid
and make it worse.
Hey, Aunt Nina.
Hi, T erri Boo-berry.
Honey.
- Why was this in the trash?
- You got in. Congratulations.
- Paul would be so proud of you.
- Mom, what are you doing?
If Paul were here, he would just get
in another screaming fight  with Dad about it.
Okay. Everything
is different now.
- Do you still want to go?
- I don't want to sing anymore.
I don't believe that,
Terri.
Why don't you let me
handle your Dad about this.
- I think Terri should come visit me.
- Hmm.
Simon, I really think
she needs to get away
and I'd like her to come to Palm Desert
for the month of August.
A month with you,
alone in the desert? Are you nuts?
It is alone, isn't it?
I'm between guys right now.
So yes, I'm alone.
Yeah, for the moment.
Well who's going to help me
in the restaurant?
Oh, is that really what
you want to say, Simon?
"Who's gonna help me
with the restaurant?"
Aunt Nina,
who said that you could do that?
I've never lied
to my father before.
Terri, I just think
this is your life.
You deserve the chance to live it.
Then why does it feel so wrong?
There's something about your dad
that I don't think you know.
He and his friend David both got
football scholarships to UCLA.
Really?
And when graduation
rolled around,
our family restaurant  was doing good,
but our parents weren't.
Neither of us wanted the restaurant,
but your Dad felt he had
no choice but to take it.
And, uh, his friend David
went on to UCLA.
And he got caught upin the L.A. scene
and he's been messed up ever since.
But I know
that if your Dad had taken
that scholarship,
he would have made it
So, what does that
have to do with me?
I don't know.
Everything?
But it's
your decision, Terri.
He would have wanted
you to have this, honey.
Paul would have wanted
you to have this.
I shouldn't have snuck him out.
Oh, honey, it's not your fault,
- I feel so bad all the time.
No.
I can't do this.
I can't go.
I can't lie to Dad.
It's just too soon.
Honey...
I will tell Dad that you're really not at Nina's
when the time is right.
And he's gonna be
mad at first.
But he's gonna realize
it was the right thing to do.
- You sure it's the right thing to do?
- No.
I'm not sure
of anything.
I just want
you to be happy.
Okay.
I'll do it.
Okay.
Are you guys
gonna be okay?
- Yeah.
- Yeah. We'll be fine.
Uh, I'm taking her to the train station.
And, uh, Nina will pick her up on the other end.
- We'll be fine.
- Here you go. This is for you.
Dad.
I don't want Nina to pay
for everything, and uh...
You wanna come home early,
you call us, okay?
Okay. I love you.
Me too.
- Call me, okay?
- Okay.
I want you
to take this.
You just call us
whenever you want.
And make sure you conference
Aunt Nina in when you do,
'cause you know your father,
he's  gonna want to talk to her
- every once in a while. Okay?
- Got it, Mom.
- I love you.
- I love you.
!" Lift off, here I am,
here I go!"
!" Stand back,
I'm in control!"
!" I'm outta this world,
about to take off!"
!" And when I reach the stars,
I still won't stop!"
-!" 'Cause I'm about to rocket....!"
- Hey!
!" Now it's five, four,
three, two, one, lift-off!"
- I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it.
- Thank you.
Sure.
Where did
my jacket go?
Welcome to L.A., baby.
Hop in.
It's gone.
Oh, come on.
Hello?
Hey! Is anyone there?
Oh-hh--
you've got to be kidding me.
Hello!
Sorry, full up.
Hey!
Look. Are you going to make
a habit out of this?
Okay. It's lateand I'm tired
and all I want to do
is get up to my dorm. Okay?
What's the password?
Okay. I think we started off
on the wrong foot.
- I'm T erri.
- Jay.
It's "monkeys" by the way.
- The password.
- Mm-hm.
- What room?
315.
Jay. There you are.
Send you out for a snack
and you bring home a stray. Shame.
Mmm.
Hey. I'm T erri.
- Uh-huh.
- I'll catch you later. Bye.
You know what?
I think I've got it from here. Thanks.
- See ya.
- Whew.
- What?
- What was that about? What did I say?
- I'm seriously...
- 315.
Oh.
Sorry.
Hey. I'm Terri,
your new roommate.
Great. And I thought
I had this place to myself.
- Now turn out the damn light!
- Sorry.
Oh my gosh.
Okay. Okay.
- Terri?
- Hey. It's me
Oh, thank God, Terri.
Your dad's called twice already.
Well, the train was lateand my jacket got stolen
and the cab driver was a total jerk.
Are you okay?
I'm fine. Let's just conference
Dad in, okay?
Okay.
Here goes nothing.
Okay.
.√§√∞√§ √¨√∞√•
Hey. Are you there?
Yeah.
I'm still here.
- Theresa, is that you?
- Hey, yeah, Dad. It's me.
- Is Mom there too?
- Yeah, yeah.
She's just
getting on the exchange--
- Hey, honey!
- What took you so long?
We've been waiting
for you to call for like four hours.
We're sorry, Simon. Her train was late.
Oh. Well.
What are you two ladies going
to do on your first big night?
- We're watching television.
- We're just eating dinner.
- What?
- Eating dinner.
- We're watching television.
- Which is it?
We're eating dinner
while we're watching television.
Right.I thought you didn't have
a television, Nina.
I thought that was against
your artistic sensibilities.
Oh, well, l-l-- I finally
gave in. Sue me.
Uh-uh, it's okay as long as you're safe.
Are you safe, honey?
Yeah. I'm fine.
I'm just totally wiped out.
Now you get some rest.
Call us tomorrow.
- Yes?
Don't corrupt my baby.
She's too much
like you already.
Don't worry, Simon.
I'll have her tattooed, with blue hair,
and married to a rapper in no time.
Nighty-night.
Good night, Nina.
Night, Theresa.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Dad. I love you.
Bye-bye.
I love you.
I think that worked.
I think I did it.
Well, Paul, I'm here.
I hope you're happy.
Hi.
- I'm Terri, your roommate.
- Yeah. Denise.
Okay, everyone.
Take a seat.
Let's be seated.
In case you bought that old saw
that those who can't do, teach.
These talented musicians
beside me are your teachers.
But I'd prefer you
to think of them as your guides.
Hello, and welcome to Bristol-Hillman's
summer music program.
I'd like to start by reminding you
of the large number
of talented students who applied
but did not get in.
Now,
this summer is not just about
learning your craft.
It's about testing your limits
Experimenting. New experiences. It's about
building up and rocking the foundation of that
which will give you your own individual voice.
Now, some basics.
We have a strict 10:00 curfew,
1 1 :00 on the weekends.
Possession of banned substances
will mean immediate dismissal.
Hmm.
This is L.A., people.
Use some common sense.
Travel in pairs.
Lastly, the scholarship.
Three weeks from now,
on the last day of the program,
we will have final performances
where you show us
what you've got.
Now a lucky student will win a $10,000
academic scholarship
for music study.
That's pretty good, huh?
So, work hard.
Have fun.
Get lost.
Later.
Okay.
I gave her three chances.
The chances have come and gone.
Send her back
where she came from. I don't care!
People, grab a seat.
My name is Mr. Torvald.
You are my class and we have three weeks
to learn an incredibly complex choral piece.
It ain't ever gonna happen,
but let's give it the ol' college try, shall we?
There are five solos
in the ensemble.
Only five people will perform solos
in front of this class.
And I will hand them outin two weeks
based on participation,  exercises
and je nai sais quoi.
If you're not French,
that means,
"Ooh!"
I will also split you up
into groups of four.
Yes, I still count
on my fingers.
One for each part in the obnoxiously difficult
contrapuntal harmony at the end of the book.
This piece is gonna drive you nuts.
But when you nail it, it feels good.
You.
You. You.
You. Group one!
Hey, Jay!
Nice hook
Jump in and pick it up.
Hey.
Is anybody sitting here?
How many of you
can identify this note?
You there.
What is the note?
- A "B?"
- B flat!
The ability to know any note when
you hear it is great asset.
Those of you who don't have it must work
that much harder.
Is the same with your
ability to read music.
Your opportunities are expanded.
If you look at a piece of music,
see how the notes are arranged on the page
and hear exactly what it is,
each note in your head.
This is something you will learn to do this summer
in your individual studies with me.
I'm so sorry. That was me.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm-- I'm fine.
I'm sorry. That was my fault. - I was in the way.
- No, it's good. It was my fault.
- I should really learn to stand.
- Okay.
Awesome.
She doesn't even know.
- Hey. How's it going?
- Couldn't be better.
Should I ask for a single?
- Am I bothering you that much?
- Hey. Hold up.
I mean, I just get the feeling that
I'm some kinda pain in your butt.
Look, it's not even
like that, all right?
I'm here
for that scholarship.
- I'm just about hardcore focus.
- Well it seems really personal.
Oh, please.
I'm not even trying to hear that.
Look, we're all up against
each other for that money.
So I just gotta be able to do my thing
and not get caught up in any personalities.
I don't really mean
nothing by it.
So, we cool?
- Yeah. We're cool.
- Cool.
- Hey, Mr. Torvald.
- Hey, Robin.
I wanted to let you know that I tried
those exercises you gave me last summer
and they really helped.
I just wanted to say thank you so much.
My pleasure.
Oh, and I'll have you know
that I'm gunning for those solos.
- Well, I'll keep an eye out for you.
- Thank you, Mr. Torvald.
!" For the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth!"
!" Hallelujah,
hallelujah!"
!" Hallelujah, hallelujah!"
!" For the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth!"
-!" Hallelujah, Hallelujah.!"
- Ouch and cut.
- Sorry, that was me.
- Yeah, we know.
- And you are?
- Terri Fletcher.
Thought I recognized you.
The girl from the DVD.
Terri Fletcher, the thing is
the theme emerges from the harmony.
Give me you hand.
None of you follow it directly.
Capice?
Good job, Robin.
Whoo-ee!
Okay, let's do it again.
One, two, three, four.
!" For the Lord God
Omnipotent reigneth!"
!" Hallelujah,
hallelujah, hallelujah.!"
Sorry, Mr. Wesson.
I was-- I forgot my books at the--
Is your time that was wasted.
Please go to the stand.
Please sight-read the first page.
Support.
Support with your diaphragm.
Air goes in. Diaphragm goes out.
Is okay to look fat.
Sorry.
- Hey.
- What's up?
!" She doesn't,
she doesn't know!"
!" She doesn't--
she doesn't, she doesn't!"
!" She doesn't even know,
know, know!"
!" She-- she doesn't
even know, know, know, know!"
Thanks anyways.
You're a serious weirdo.
It isn't lucky
unless it's face up.
But now it's just a penny
that thinks it's lucky, but it isn't.
Well now it can be lucky
for someone else.
Besides, haven't you ever heard
of making your own luck?
Well, what do you know?
A lucky penny.
So, an Englishman in L.A.
Yeah, my parents put an ocean between
them after the nastiest divorce ever.
No joke, people study it.
So, how can you have
a sense of humor about that?
My music became like a religion.
It kept me sane.
So, music is your
higher power.
Pretty much.
I mean, look at this.
This city.
All these people.
All this life
and music.
I'm gonna make music
for them.
I can't think
of a better way to spend my life.
Are you missing home?
A little bit.
I don't know. It's just been really
tough lately.
Come on.
I just gave you my
"E! True Hollywood Story."
You gotta
give me something.
Um. Me and my brother were in a car accident
on the day of his graduation.
And, um, some drunk driver ran
through a red light and
Hey, Terri! Come here.
Uh, look, Terri, I've gotta go.
somebody.
Look, say hi
to Denise for me.
- Hey.
- Hey, was that Jay running off?
- Yeah.
- Figures. What, was he macking on you?
Not that I could tell.
Well, count your blessings,
'cause I know his game.
He likes to hit
on nice girls.
And baby, you--
you got a lock on that one.
- What?
- I mean, look at you.
Look at your hair, your clothes,
the way you talk.
You're like some kinda
retro Brady Buncher.
Shoot, I'm not even
trying to hear that.
Okay, that was cute.
My bad.
I didn't know
you could do t
Yeah. My teachers are always harping
about how it's bad for me.
You know, how I'm gonna lose my ear.
But I just like how it sounds in here.
- Hello.
- Oh hi, honey.
Um, Dad wants
to talk to you.
Um, Simon, pick up.
Hey, sweetheart.
How's it going? Hanging in there?
- Yeah, everything's good.
- Sure do miss you.
I miss you too, Dad.
- What was that? Sounded like a siren.
- Uh, no, no. It's nothing.
Well, it didn't sound like nothing.
It sounded pretty close.
The neighbors are out of town
and their alarm keeps going off
so, I'm gonna go talk
to the police, okay?
- I'll call you back. All right, bye.
- Okay, bye, honey.
Uh, what, Terri, wait.
Terri?
I'm gonna lose it.
!" King of Kings!"
!" Forever and ever!"
-!" Hallelujah, hallelujah!"
!" And Lord of Lords...!"
!" Forever and ever!"
-!" Hallelujah, hallelujah!"
- Yes.
!" King of Kings!"

!" Forever and ever!"
!" Hallelujah, hallelujah!"
!" And Lord of Lords...!"
I can never get that note.
I can't believe this.
- I can.
- Problem, ladies?
Yeah, I think that some of us
maybe need to practice this
- a little bit more outside of class.  Meow!
-Why don't you let me
worry about that, hmm?
Okay, that's it.
Done for the day.
Go on.
Get outta here.
Ms. Fletcher.
Okay, I give up.
What did you do
with the girl on the DVD?
Excuse me?
The lively, funny, talented girl,
what did you do with her?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I sent my songs on a CD.
No, there was also a DVD.
It came in late. We almost didn't see it.
But it's a big part of the reason why you are here.
Sit down. Be comfortable.
Okay, Mr. T orvald. I did not send it.
I really have no idea
what you're talking about.
No? Well.
Let me introduce you
to one interesting, fascinating lady.
Maybe you'll be inspired.
I know we were.
Terri's my sister. And, uh, she's my
favorite person in the whole world.
She like a challenge.
She thrives when she's pushed.
And the people who can do that,
they don't live in Flagstaff.
Terri deserves a chance
to learn from the best.
She's already good.
But she could be great.
If you let her in,
you won't be disappointed.
Hey, Terri?
Terri!
Terri.
Are you okay?
Please. It's probably just some
weirdo misfit thing.
No.
The show's over.
Okay, you can go now.
Look, whatever it is,
you can't leave.
- It's copping out.
- What are you doing here?
Same as everybody else.
The music thing.
Ducking a summer job.
I mean here in my doorway.
Look, come on.
Let's just get outta here.
Come on.
Let's just go.
The bag isn't walking away.
How do I know you won't?
I was sitting
right next to him.
And he died and I didn't.
You know?
And I don't know why.
But I miss him.
The second I start to feel
like I'm enjoying myself,
this voice comes
inside my head and..
it's like,"How can you be having
a good time when Paul is dead?"
You can't blame
yourself like that.
You don't understand
It was my fault
I got him to sneak out.
I shouldn't
have risked it.
Look, T erri.
Some idiot ran a red light.
It was bad luck.
Messed up timing.
That's all.
You weren't there.
Look, I can't imagine
what you're going through.
But I do know from experience
backing down can become a way of life
Don't leave.
Screw the pressure. Screw the scholarship.
I mean, do your own thing
on your own terms.
And get what you came here for.
- That's what counts.
- But Jay, I'm lying to people.
I mean, I had to lie
to get here.
So what. You got here.
It's not suppose to be easy.
You're here because you did
what you had to do.
Why do you care so much?
I don't know.
I like you.
And Robin fits
into that, how?
We met here last year and.
we had a thing for a while.
That's all over.
Does she know that?
Yeah, well... some people hang on
when they should just let go.
Thank you.
Okay, I'm not doing this
to torture you people.
Just think of this as a midterm worth,
oh, half your grade.
Ms. Fletcher? Please?
That was great.
All right, you take the top of the fourth.
- Awesome. - I was talking to T erri. Bing!
Okay, let's take the third part from the top.
Is everybody ready?
One, two, three, four
Hey.
What's this?
I think maybe Giordanni is not for you.
We try something else, hmm?
You know, I appreciate
the thought, Mr. Wesson,
but, you know, I'd really like to stick
to the old one.
I'm feeling much better today
and I wanna see if I can keep it up.
Thanks.
!" You and me!"
!" Can't you see!"
!" How our hearts are one?!"
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, uh...
just...the door was open.
I just heard you playing.
Oh, don't stop.
No, it's, um, it's okay. I was, um,
I was finished anyway. Whatever.
Terri, wait.
I'm sorry, I'm just...
a bit weird when I'm writing.
- Why?  - Well...
I-it's just my lyrics. They're really lame.
I mean, when I sing them.
And I want them to mean so much more, but--
Well, I've been writing songs since I was a kid.
But my arrangements 
sound like some cheesy Saturday
 morning cartoon or something.
- Play something for me.
- Oh, um.
- It's not ready yet.
- Come on, whatever happened to that...
"You've got to do your own thing on your own terms"
junk that you gave
me the other day?
Come on.
Okay.
!" You and me
can't you see!"
!" How our hearts
are one?!"
!" Please believe!"
!" And don't deceive!"
!" Now our journey's
just begun!"
!" The sunlight in your hair!"
!" Makes my heart jump in the air...!"
- Okay, wait.
I like the music a lot. - Yeah?
- Okay? But what about this?
- Yeah, I like that. - Okay?
It's very cool.
Oh, spring, when a young
man's fancy turns to love.
- Did you guys see that? - What?
Oh, it's weird 'cause there's a hole
  in my chest . where my heart used to be
'cause someone else yanked it out 
 and she doesn't even
friggin' care that she did it.
Are you talking about the girl in
the black sweatshirt?
Dude, she's the hottest
player here.
I heard her in the practice
rooms and she's flawless.
-Well, she looked at me
and I just...
oh, man, snap.
- Friend, you're hooked.
- Hopelessly.
- Have you ever even talked to her?
- No, I'm working on that.
See, the problem is she won't give me the time of day.
Well, why don't l
introduce you guys?
What if I told you
you were the coolest girl ever?
Jay, I like this girl.
You know how to pick them.
- I've always said that, haven't l, Jay?
- Yeah, he has always said that.
Kiwi seal of approval.
Hi.
Hey, I'm Terri.
Sorry to bother you.
Your name?
Sloane.
√†√∞√© √©√•√£√≤√∫ √π√†√©√Ø √¨√∞√• √π√•√≠
,√π√©√≤√•√∏ √°√©√ß√£ √†√• √Æ√π√§√•
I-- I know we don't have
any classes together or anything, but...
um, I just thought that I'd introduce myself.
Okay.
Okay, so there's this guy, right?
And, um, he's really nice and his name's Kiwi
and he kinda has a crush on you.
So we were wondering
if you wanted to come
hang out with us on Saturday night?
Kiwi's a weird name.
Why would he have a crush on me?
That's stupid.
Um, I mean, sometimes there's just
nothing you can do about it.
Well, anyway, um, we're gonna meet
in the lobby at 7:00
and, um, we're gonna grab
a bite to eat, okay?
I guess.
Great.
Okay.
Really good.
It's kinda weird talking.
Okay, you think and throw it at.
You beautiful
little petunia.
- You-- ah! Ah, sacre bleu! Ah!
- I got you, ma
Okay, girl. So talk to me
Now it's you and Jay?
I mean, he's really cool.
And what about Robin, Ms. Thing?
- He says they're over.
- Yeah, right.
- That's really cute. - Oh, you like this?
Yeah.My mom, she runs this funky
little clothing shop.
- She's got great taste.
- Really?
Yeah, I just wish business
was better though, you know?
I mean, even with me working part-time
bagging groceries, and you know,
doing what I can
street performing,
we still had crazy trouble
scrapping up the tuition.
I mean, why do you think I'm stressing
that scholarship?
Hey, come here for a second.
I want you to see what this looks like.
- Really?
- Yeah, come on.
You forced me.
- Oh yeah, that's fresh.
- Oh, do I look like I'm going clubbing?
Frances gone to Ninas. to check on Terrri
Call me Simon
Oh my God.
- Hey, Aunt Nina.
- Terri, thank God I reached you!
Your dad called, I did my thing.
I think he smells a rat.
I don't know how, I don't know why.
But your mother just called
and said he is on his way here, now!
I'll stall him as best I can but is
there any way you can just get here?
Oh my God. We're dead.
I'm dead.
Hey, Jay!
- Okay, thanks. - Good luck, Terri.
I'll see you tomorrow night, all right?
The desert train is now
boarding on platform 12.
We're getting a little break
from the 100-plus temperatures
here in the greater Palm Springs area.
Wind's out of the northeast at six miles per hour.
- Hey.
- Hey, Nina. Where is she?
Ah, well, um...
there's something
I wanted to talk to you about, Simon.
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah, um--
Daddy!
- I missed you.
- Oh, I missed you too.
I need a drink.
Sorry.
They're not coming, man. I'm telling you.
- They're not showing up.
- No way. Look,
women are always fashionably late.- They'll be here.
- Okay, 
- Dude. - Thanks, man.
No, no, no, dude.
Damn it.
No, no, wait, wait, wait!
Don't walk away.
Hey, you guys,
I'm sorry I'm late.
Hey, Sloane,
you look great.
Yeah.
Come on, let's go.
Um, I think
you should-- cool.
No, seriously
. I had to pretend to my
dad like I had been there
the whole entire time, and meanwhile
my aunt was remodeling her house,
so when I went to go find the bathroom,
I walked into a closet.
- No way. - Yes way.
Yeah, you know, we all
thought you were like some
goody-two-shoes,
but you're like a fugitive from the law.
Speaking of which, fugitive,
where are you leading us to?  You'll see.
- She's good.
- Beyond, man.
This one, okay?
!" You got a smile
so bright!"
!" You know you could
have been a candle!"
!" I'm holding
you so tight...!"
Come on you guys.
Come on.
- No, no, no.
-!" The way you swept me off my feet!"
!" You know you could
have been some perfume!"
!" Well you could have been
anything that you wanted to!"
!" And I could tell!"
!" The way you do
the things you do!"
!" And as pretty as you are!"
!" You know you could
have been a flower...!"
I like to come up here
sometimes to think.
This is really cool.
I love it up here.
Wish I had a place
to think like this.
Well, you play your cards right,
maybe I'll share with you.
- Maybe?
- Maybe.
Depends on what you
come up here to think about.
Stuff.
My dreams. Music. The future.
If I have one.
Come on.
Too fast?
Not ready.
Well... cool.
I mean I like you. A lot.
Yeah, I like you too.
-I was thinking of that song
we were working on the other day. 
-Um-hmm.
I think we should do it for our final
performance piece.
You sing. I'll play.
We could split the scholarship
and we could write something
really meaningful.
- Okay?
- Deal.
Do you want
to try that again?
What?
√Æ!" Something in the wayyou throw your hair!"
!" Back over your shoulder!"
!" Something in the way you smile!"
!" When you're looking my way!"
!" I've got no concerns!"
!" The days are long and the nights get colder!"
!" Because it's this I've got to try!"
!" On you, honey!"
!" I ain't never wishin' for the change!"
!" In my condition!"
!" I'm not rich but I know!"
!" That the sun will shine for me!"
!" Ride with me!"
!" Won't you take a ride with me?!"
- Let's go, let's go!
- Hey, it's open mic night, guys.
Tough crowd.
- Yeah. - Tell me about it.
I'm gonna go see if we can get onto the list to perform.
What? Jay, no.
Hey look, we can practice forever, 
 but sooner or later we're gonna
have to do it.
We gotta get out of here.
All right, all right.
Stanley Wilson, ladies and gentlemen.
Let's give a big hand
to Stanley Wilson.
- Why are you here?!
- You suck, man!
Good job.
- I'm so nervous.
- Well, look, just--picture the audience naked.
-Okay, bad idea.
-All right, next up,
we have Terri and Jay.
Now, it is their first time here at the Blue Moon,
so let's give them a warm welcome.
T erri and Jay, everyone.
!" There's a light in me!"  !" And--!"
- Let me start over.
- Come on, sing something!
!" There's a light in me!"
- Hey, turn around.
-!" And it's shine--!"
Look, it's okay.
Turn around.
Sorry.
!" There's a light in me!"
!" And it's shine--shine!"
!" I can't help--!"
Paul!
Terri! Terri!
Terri, wait, wait! - Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I saw--
I just wasn't ready.
I-- I was gonna wait.
But, um,
this is for you.
Paul's cross.
Good. Nice. 
Improving.
We've got 10 minutes left.
I want to run the third section. 
Has anybody seen Terri?
I can sing the part, Mr. T orvald, I know
it backwards and forwards.
It's T erri's solo, so lets wait for her.
-But she's not even here. 
 And it's not like she can sing it anyway.
Terri's worked hard for it. She deserves it.
-No, I deserve this part!
Stop it. Jeez.
Well I guess you have
a new favorite now!
Whoa, whoa.
What's wrong?
I don't understand.
I don't-- I don't see how things can
just go from being so great
one summer to turn
to such crap the next.
I'm sorry, Robin.
Can we talk?
I mean, privately?
Hey, Mr. T orvald.
I'm sorry I missed class.
Well, that's okay.
Are you feeling better?
- What?
- If you missed my class, you must be deathly ill.
It's too bad because we were gonna
work on your solo today.
- I'm not ready for a solo.
- Yes, you are.
Don't you even know how much you've
improved since you've been here?
Okay, but there are much better singers
here, Mr. T orvald
I'll be the judge of that.
We'll try it again tomorrow.
Look, Terri,
there's people in the class who are
desperate to do this solo,
so if you don't care about the work,
what have you been doing here?
This is so humiliating.
You're suppose to be with me.
Look, just--
take it easy.
Worse things have happened, right?
Yeah, all the time. Just not to me.
I always get my way.
- Is that a bad thing to say?
- Well, maybe a little, yeah.
But I thought you liked bad.
Maybe a little bad?
Come on,
 we got along really well last summer, didn't we?
People change, Robin.
I'm not the same person
I was last summer.
Neither are you. I don't know.
I think we can be those two people again. 
Don't you?
Hey, have you seen Jay?
Uh, heading to the practice room, I think.
I think I know the problem.
I'm bad.
But I can be better.
Terri, wait!
Terri!
T erri!
Terri, wait!
- Wait.
- Jerk!
Terri! - Jay?
- Stay away from me! Terri!
Stupid.
!" I don't know your face!" !" No more!"
!" Or feel the touch!" !" That I adore!"
!" I don't know your face!" !" No more!"
!" It's just a place!" !" I'm looking for...!"
- T erri, come on, please.
- She doesn't want to talk to you.
Just back off.
!" We might as well be living!"
!" In another town!"
" We might as well!"
!" We might as well!"
!" We might as well!"
!" Be strangers...!"
!" Be strangers!"
!" For all I know!" !" Of you now!"
!" For all I know.!"
Aw, hey. You okay?
It's nothing.
I'm sorry if I was hard
on you the other day.
I just want you to know that I'm here for you
 if you need anything. If you want to talk  Anything.
Okay?
Have you ever lost anyone?
Yeah
I just can't let this go.
Well, you're an artist
and artists feel things differently
than regular people.
Look at Patsy Cline or Billie Holiday.
You could hear it in their voice. Or,
Vincent van Gogh Cut off his ear,
but hey, he could paint.
Vincent van Gogh killed himself.
That's right.
That's a bad example.
Hey, I'm a music teacher, not a shrink.
What do you want?
I guess...
what I'm trying to say is artists convey emotion.
They make an audience feel
what they're feeling.
You know, that's
what it's all about, right?
You just have to find a way to take 
what's in here and put it in here. What the hell.
-Who is it?
-It's Jay.  Let me in!
- Go away, you jackass!
- No, no, no!
I just-- please, I just want
to talk to Terri, okay?
- Just let me in.
- He sounds drunk.
Uh, you think? Hey, girl,
do not open that door.
Okay, I'm gonna make
him leave, all right?
Jay, you have to leave now.
- No!
- Ow!
That hurt a lot.
- Shh.
- No, it's not what you think.
What's going on?!
- I saw you kissing her, okay?
- No, no.
- You  Shut up!
- Come on, Terri.
- I'm trying to sleep.
Sh-- I wasn't kissing her.
She was-- she was kissing me.
Oh no. He didn't even try
to go there, please.
I'm sure that makes a lot of sense, Jay,
- when you're drunk.
- T erri,
I don't care about her. - I care about you.
- Boy, who you trying to play? Terri?
- Denise, just chill out, all right?
Look, Terri, I care about you.
- You know I do.
- Why would you do that?
Why would you drink?
Because, because I'm--
I'm worthless.
You know what? Don't even try and give
me that self-pity thing, okay?
Terri, look.
Y'all need to relocate.
Okay, well, I'm never going to get him
past the night guard, so you--
- I'll be fine. I'll just--
- You have--
-You have to help me get him up to the roof.
-This is too much drama for me.
- Shh-hh. - I'm fine.
You're not fine, okay?
Oh wow! I love this roof!
It's so cool.
- Oh, his breath is nasty.
Oh! I'm spinning.
Help him!
Oh my God.
I'm out.
Thank you.
- What did you do?
- I don't feel so good. - I'm sure you don't.
!" In a moment!" !" Everything can change!"
!" Feel the wind
on your shoulder!"
!" For a minute!" !" All the world can wait!"
-!" Let go of your yesterday!"
- Wake up.
!" Can you hear it calling?!"
!" Can you feel itin your soul?!" 
-!" Can you trust this longing!"
- Wake up, it's a new day.
!" And take control?!"
!" Fly!" !" Open up the part of you!"
!" 'Cause it's your time!"
!" Time to fly...!"
I'm really sorry.
Save it.
You're not forgiven yet.
Come on, let's go.
!" In a moment!" !" Everything can change.!"
Frances!
Do you have the car keys?
Frances?
Car keys?
Frances? -So I wrote some new lyrics
and now all we have to do is practice,
- so we can pull this off.
- Right.
Here's the music.
Okay, well,
let's start here.
- I wanna work on the bridge.
- Okay.
!" It doesn't matter
what people say!"
!" And it doesn't matter
how long it takes!"
!" Believe in yourself
and you'll fly--!"
It's not-- let's, um, go again
and try it a little faster.
- Okay.
- Okay.
!" It doesn't--!"

Stop.
Okay, for real this time. Let's go.
!" It doesn't matter
what people say--!"√©√≠
It sounded fine the first time.
Okay, but "fine" is not going to win us
the scholarship.
Okay, it's gotta be right.And I'm not gonna give up
until I nail it.
It'll drive me nuts.
!" It doesn't matter--
it doesn't matter!"
!" It doesn't matter
how long it takes!"
!" Believe in yourself
and you'll fly high.!"
What? You did what?
She got accepted, Simon.
Out of all the applicants in America,
our T erri got in.
You mean she's been there this whole time?
- Did you hear me?
- You-- you lied to me? - You and Nina?
- Did you hear? Our daughter...
got into the best music school in the country.
All of you lied to me.
All of you.
But Terri wanted to go.
Paul wanted her to go. Paul!
Terri's singing again.
Why doesn't this matter to you?
What in God's name
is wrong with you, Frances?
What's wrong with me?
We just lost our son.
We were losing the only child we have left.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
That's my point. 
She's just a child.  She's our child. 
And how can I protect her if she's not here?
I want her home.
I want her home now.
Will you shut up in here?!
You are the loudest,
noisiest, rudest jerk on the planet!
- Oh, ow!
- Sorry.
Thank you and welcome.
Well, it's time to bring
things to a close.
It's been great fun and we have even
more in store for you.
Today we have a full slate
of final performances.
And some of our performerswill be backed up 
by members  of the Bristol-Hillman House Band.
Oh my God! - What?
- I don't have Paul's necklace.
No, I can't do this
without him. - Terri? Terri, wait.
- No, uh, don't worry. I'll be back.
And give a hand to our first performer,
Miss Robin Childers.
!" Let your body move
on the dance floor!"
!" Feel the rhythm
as your body gets warm...!"
- Dad?
- Pack your things, T erri.- Let's go home.
- Daddy, no!
Not a word, Theresa. Just do it.
Your mother's waiting  downstairs.
!" Just as you head is spinning!"
!" As you slowly start to lose control.!"
Go, Robin!
!"Thank you.
Great performance!
Our next performer is Mr. Engelbert Wilson.
Engelbert?
Come on out, boy!
Did you hear what I said?
Pack your things.
Dad, you know what? You did this to Paul
and now you're doing this to me.
Don't you dare bring Paul into this.
Okay, well, I'm not gonna let you hold me back.
- You lied to me, Terri.
- And I'm sorry about that. But I did what I had to do.
Okay, you don't listen
to anybody, and we're all afraid of you.
She doesn't even know!
!" She wants the creature
from outer space!"
!" Time is running out.!"
Dad... this place is the scariest,
 hardest best thing that has everhappened to me,
no matter
how I got here.
We'll discuss it at home.
I'm not leaving.
and I did this for me and I'm gonna
finish it for me.
You can take me home
if you want to, Dad.
But I'm performing any minute now,
and it would mean the world to me if you
and Mom were there to support me.
I worked so hard here.
And I'm really good.
I want you to hear me.
Please, Dad
Please, let me stay.
- All right, Denise!
- Yes!
Yes, that was
wonderful, Denise.
And now last, but not least,
Theresa Fletcher and Jay Corgan.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sorry to announce--
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my sincere pleasure
to present to you the distinctive vocal ,
stylings of the one
 the only, Terri Fletcher!
this song Jay and I wrote together,
and, um, I would like to dedicate it
to my brother,
Paul Fletcher.
!" I found myself today!"
!" Oh I found myself and ran aw
!" But something pulled me back!
!" The voice of reason, I forgot I had!"
!" All I know is you're not here to say!"
!" What you always used to say!"
!" But it's written in the sky tonight!"

!" So I won't give up!"
!" No, I won't break down!"
!" Sooner than it seems life turns around!"
!" And I will be strong 
even if it all goes wrong!"
!" When I'm standing in the dark, I'll still believe!"
<i!" Someone's watching over me!"
!" I've seen that bright light!" 
" And it's shining on my destiny!"
!" Shining all the time,
and I won't be afraid!"
!" To follow everywhere
it's taking me!"

!" All I know is yesterday is gone!
!" And right now I belong!"
!" To this moment,
to my dreams!"

!" So I won't give up!"
!" No, I won't break down!"
!" Sooner then it seems
life turns around!"
!" And I will be strong
even if it all goes wrong!"
!" Someone's watching over me!"
!" It doesn't matter what people say!"
!" And it doesn't matter how long it takes!"
!" Believe in yourself and you'll fly high!"
!" And it only matters how true you are!"
!" Be true to yourself and follow your heart!"
!" So I won't give up!"
!" No, I won't break down!"
!" Sooner than it seems life turns around!"
!" And I will be strong even if it all goes wrong!"
!" When I'm standing in the dark, I'll still believe!"
!" That I won't give up!"
!" No, I won't break down!"
!" Sooner than it seems life turns around!"
!" And I will be strong even when it all goes wrong!"
!" When I'm standing in the dark, I'll still believe!"
!" That someone's
watching over--!"
!" Someone's
watching over--!"
!" Someone's
watching over me!"
!" Someone's
watching over me!"
Way to go, Terri!
- You did it! You were awesome!
- We did it!
Nothing will ever top
what I just felt.
- We got it. - We got it?
Are you sure? All right.
Each year we present a $1 0,000 academic 
scholarship  in Music Studies 
 to an outstanding student in the 
summer music program
This year's program
was better than most,
full of talented,
hardworking students.
It's a shame we only have one scholarship to give.
So without further ado,
the board of directors  of the Bristol-Hillman Music Conservatory is pleased to present
this scholarship to...
Denise Gilmore.
- Oh honey! You were so wonderful!
- Oh, thank you! Truly amazing
but then again, it's in the genes.
Aunt Nina, thank you for everything.
I wish you would have won that scholarship.
No, Mom, it doesn't even matter.
I just-- I got to be up there,
you know?
- Yeah.
- You um...
you were great, Terri.
Really.
Thank you, Dad.-
Let me talk to you for a second alone, all right?
I uh-- I just want to tell
you I was wrong.
No, you know what, Dad?
I should have never--
Just let me talk, please.
I just-- I was wrong.
I can just be, uh, pretty hardheaded
sometimes, you know?
Anyway, I just wanted
to tell you that, uh..
it was probably the proudest moment of my life
seeing you up there.
I just wish Paul

Hey, Terri.
Come on


!" In this place
that has no name!"
!" I can't remember
why I came!"
!" And then I hear
you whispering!"
!" One more mile
to Jericho!"
!" Nothing is ever
what it seems!"
!" When you live
inside your dreams!"
!" The walls will tumble,
the walls will tumble!"
!" But I'm not
going to cry!"
!" My heart won't crumble,
my heart won't crumble!"
!" If we ever say goodbye!"
!" Everybody gets the joke!"
!" Where's the fire?
Where's the smoke?!"
!" Money, love and jealousy!"
!" Something's got ahold of me
!" But I will follow
where you go!"
!" One more mile to Jericho!"
!" The walls will tumble,
the walls will tumble!"
!" But I'm not gonna cry!"
!" My heart won't crumble,
my heart won't crumble!"
!" If we ever say goodbye!"
!" Goodbye now!"
!" Goodbye!"
!" One more mile,
one more kiss!"
!" One more word,one more wish!"
!" The walls will tumble,
the walls will tumble!"
!" But I'm not gonna cry!"
!" My heart won't crumble,
my heart won't crumble!"
!" If we ever say goodbye!"
!" The walls will tumble,
the walls will tumble!"
!" But I'm not gonna cry!"
!" My heart won't crumble,
my heart won't crumble!"
!" If we ever say goodbye!"
!" My heart won't crumble,
my heart won't crumble!"
!" If we ever say goodbye!"
!" If we ever say goodbye!"
!" If we ever say goodbye!"
!" If we ever say goodbye!"
