Let's get back to the lunch.
Don't you think the most important part
of a meal is the wine?
Everything must follow the wine.
And in this case,
I could favor a red Bordeaux.
A red Bordeaux at lunch?
Your late husband
would never have approved.
William!
William, stay away from the edge!
The edge is no place to play!
Yes, ma'am.
What is it, William?
I don't know.
He's got a knife in his back.
William!
Run, William! William!
- Joseph, over there!
- Get down, Eden!
Damn.
Joseph!
Leave us alone. You hear?
Get back! Leave us alone!
Come, girl.
Come on.
I am the Raisuli.
Do not laugh at me again.
Secretary of state to the president.
I regret to inform you that I have
received the following dispatch...
from Samuel Gummere, United States
general consul, Tangier, Morocco.
On October 15, Mrs. Eden Pedecaris
and her children...
were kidnapped from their residence
in Tangier...
after the brutal murder
of her servants and a guest...
Sir Joshua Kenyon-Smith,
a British subject.
The act of barbarous criminality appears
perpetrated by Mulay El-Raisuli...
Sharif of the Rifian Berbers
and the last of the Barbary pirates.
The British minister and myself
concur there exists...
alarming prospects of danger
for all foreigners in Morocco.
Request warships.
Gentlemen, the presidency was
never won by a vice president...
filling out his fallen predecessor's
term of office.
That may not be in this instance...
The only thing people will
remember about McKinley...
is he got himself shot.
Teddy's the most popular president
since Washington.
Why drag in Washington?
You know it and I know it, but that
damn cowboy doesn't know it.
What he wants is some issue
to hang his campaign on...
something to arouse the populace.
- A cavalry charge?
- So to speak.
Morocco?
You know as well as I do
we can't have Arab desperadoes...
running around kidnapping
American citizens.
If I had my way,
I'd go in with Winchesters...
a battalion of Marines...
- I can't do that. Can I?
- No.
- Has this Raspuli?
- Raisuli.
Raspuli, Raisuli, whatever.
- Has he made any terms?
- No.
- Good, that gives us an excuse.
- He will, though.
What makes you so sure?
He kidnapped a British consul once...
but they became friends, and he sent
him back. Spat on the blood money.
Yes. There's been others, though,
Spanish and French emissaries.
Send them back too?
- Parts of them.
- Parts of them?
Obviously, he has no respect
for human life.
Threatening the lives and property
of American citizens...
it's an insult in the eyes
of the world community.
Arabian thief holding me up
like a common desperado.
Theodore, you're on to something.
I don't quite know what.
- What is it that you want, Theodore?
- What do I want? I want respect!
That's what. Respect for human life
and American property.
And I'll send the Atlantic squadron
to Morocco to get respect.
That's illegal.
Why spoil the beauty of a thing
with legality?
The fleet sails tomorrow.
America wants Pedecaris alive
or Raisuli dead!
Very good.
Pedecaris alive...
or Raisuli dead.
Bull's-eye!
Don't touch me with that thing again!
I'm quite capable of understanding
your gibberish!
Jennifer.
- William? William!
- Your hand, lady.
Oh, get away from me,
for God's sake, you...
Get on those horses, Jennifer.
Let go of this!
Now I don't know who you are
or what you want with us...
but I will tell you
that I am no coward.
And if you or any of these men
should dare to lay a hand on me...
I will try with all the strength in me
to kill you...
and with my last breath,
I shall curse you to God!
God will listen!
- Do you play checkers?
- No, I play chess.
Better.
This is the RIF.
I am Mulay Achmed Mohammed
El-Raisuli the Magnificent...
Sheriff of the Rifian Berbers.
I am the true defender
of the faithful...
the blood of the prophet
runs in me...
and I am but a servant of his will.
You have nothing to say?
It has never been my intention
to encourage braggarts.
Your shell is strong like a turtle's...
but it is brittle.
Your tongue is clever and fast.
Be careful you do not trip over it.
You are a great deal of trouble.
Now see here, Abal, I don't intend to
waste any more time watching you eat.
This is an effrontery.
Have you ever heard
of the big stick, Bashaw?
Do not threaten me, Mr. Gummere.
I have been threatened by the French...
Germans and the English.
I've been threatened by experts,
Mr. Gummere.
And yet Morocco is still
the only sovereign Moslem throne...
west of Constantinople.
- Yes, but it is shaky.
Yes, we have French infantry
and German cavalry.
Our currency is Spanish, but my
nephew is the sultan of Morocco.
And it is as it shall be.
Well, if you wish it to stay that way...
then I implore you
to send your French infantry...
and your German cavalry into the RIF
and bring our people back.
Better to serve the leopards
than the fox.
I am only a servant of the sultan, the
chosen one, the defender of the faithful.
I can make no such decision.
Very well then, we shall seek
an audience with the sultan himself.
He will not see you...
unless it pleases him.
Now listen here,
we represent a modern power!
We're talking about Marines,
battleships, big guns.
- We are not fooling about.
- Richard.
We are not here to make threats...
merely entreaties.
Now tell me, Bashaw, what would
please the sultan? Gold?
More bicycles?
- Another carriage?
- Lions.
Lions would please the sultan.
Lions are noble.
Very well.
Mr. Dreighton will leave this afternoon
for Fez with a pair of lions.
Lions?
We shall drink from my well.
Thank you, William.
That's rather refreshing.
Here, children, have some of these.
They'll give you strength.
Mama, who do you think he really is?
- Is he a pirate?
- He's a brigand and a lout.
Pay him no serious mention. We shall
see the better side of this, God willing.
He has the way about him, doesn't he?
He sure has the way.
Woman, I want you to understand this.
I am not a barbarous man.
I am a scholar and a leader
to my people.
I am not a barbarous man.
These four men have dishonored me.
They have eaten from my trees.
They have drunk water from my wells.
They have done
all of these things to me...
and they have not even evoked
my name to God in thankfulness.
I am treated this way because
I make war upon the Europeans.
You see the man at the well?
How he draws the water?
When one bucket empties,
the other fills.
It is so with the world.
At present, you are full of power.
But you are spilling it wastefully...
and Islam is lapping up the drops
as they spill from your bucket.
Did you see that?
And you are not a barbarous man!
- They had broken God's will.
- You mean your will!
I have no will, only that of God.
I had to kill the two,
or I could not trust the other two.
A barbarous man
would have killed them all.
Be not so quick to judge our ways.
Ignorance is a steep hill
with rocks at the bottom.
Do you pray often?
- I pray to Mecca five times a day.
- Is that so?
I wonder how you find time. You're
so busy cutting off men's heads...
and kidnapping women and children.
- If I miss the morning prayer...
I pray twice in the afternoon.
Allah is very understanding.
You gonna build that canal
in Panama, Teddy?
I'll dig it with my own hands
if I have to!
Remember the Maine!
I remembered it, did you?
Teddy, you ain't gonna let them
push us around in Morocco?
Madam, I have something
to say about Morocco.
This is a good time as any to say it.
It is my policy...
It's my policy to protect American
citizens and American interests...
whenever, wherever
they are threatened!
And furthermore...
I am not a man to stand by
and condone barbaric acts...
which are perpetrated against
innocent women and children!
We shall mete out justice that
is swift and retribution that is final!
American wants Pedecaris alive
or Raisuli dead!
I was good. Wasn't I, John?
It was a marvelous speech.
I'd even vote for you myself.
Have the train go slowly.
I want to listen to them a while.
You will be more pleased here.
Sleep better.
It is the wish of the Raisuli.
Be sure and thank him for me.
You will sleep here.
Yes, I was told.
Good.
You do not want to eat?
This is not a good move.
I can take your knight.
- You can?
- Yes.
Well, the loss of my knight
does not mean you will win.
The lion takes long strides, but the path
is worn smooth by pygmy armies.
Yes, and a fool and his money
are soon parted.
I've checked your queen also.
You are in a lot of trouble.
You should never have moved
that bishop or kidnapped me.
Both will see you undone.
It is not I who decides
the outcome of these events.
It is the will of Allah.
I am but an instrument of that will.
It is the wind that passes,
but the sea remains.
A stitch in time saves nine.
Make your move.
What do you intend to do with us?
It is my intention to embarrass Mulay
Abd Al-Aziz, the sultan to Morocco.
The tribesmen will see that he is the
bought dog of the European armies...
a slave to French and
German masters.
The tribesmen will join me in a jihad
to abolish this foreign pestilence.
And this is your way, abducting women
and children, killing unarmed servants?
I prefer to fight the European armies,
but they do not fight as men.
They fight as dogs.
Men prefer to fight with swords
so they can see each other's eyes.
Sometimes this is not possible.
Then they fight with rifles.
The Europeans have guns that fire many
times promiscuously and rend the earth.
There is no honor in this.
Nothing is decided from this.
Therefore, I shall take women
and children when it pleases me.
What have you demanded
for our return?
Gold...
rifles...
the head of the Bashaw
in a basket of melons...
the sovereignty of my people.
The English have paid
very well in the past.
You'll not have your way
with the Americans.
President Roosevelt will have
your head for this!
This President Roosevelt,
he would try and take it himself?
He certainly would. He is a man of grit
and strong moral fiber.
He does not kidnap women and children!
- What kind of rifle does he use?
- A Winchester.
Winchester?
Winchester?
- I have no knowledge of this rifle.
- You will.
Sharif of Wazan, lord of the desert.
- Mrs. Pedecaris.
- The pleasure is mine.
Charmed.
The sherif has honored me by carrying
my entreaties to the Europeans.
What is that?
That is a tongue.
Well, why would anyone want
to cut out a man's tongue?
Perhaps the previous owner
had nothing pleasant to say.
I believe I'm about to be sick.
Must be the heat.
- What is it?
- Some kind of tongue.
Children, get up from that tongue!
Good God!
The reply from the American Bashaw.
- Speaking for the lord of the Americans.
- President Roosevelt?
"Pedecaris alive or Raisuli dead"?
You are not in a position to laugh.
Do not laugh at the Raisuli!
Go to Zinat.
Cut the small finger from a woman,
take it to these Americans...
tell them it is a finger
of the woman Pedecaris...
and that the Raisuli is a man
of patience, but not unending.
Does this president, this Roosevelt?
Does he have no respect
for human life?
Hey, what'd you bring in, colonel?
Got some venison and a cougar.
- Heard about the bear, have you?
- Big one, I heard.
Coffee, Mr. President?
Is that the bear?
Yes, this is the bear that attacked
the horse camp at dawn.
He knew that men would be asleep
or at their worst at dawn.
He injured one of the Indians severely.
Killed several of the horses too.
Did you participate in stopping
the bear, Mr. President?
Yes, I regret to say.
- Why do you regret, Mr. President?
- Because he's a fine creature.
This is his valley.
This valley belonged to the bear,
and we're the intruders here.
We're accustomed to wild animals taking
flight at the sight of men with guns.
The American grizzly fears nothing...
not man, not guns, not death.
Do you intend to have this bear
as a rug in the White House?
Rug? No.
No, I intend to have him stuffed
and placed on exhibit.
The Smithsonian Institute.
The American grizzly bear is a symbol
of the American character.
Strength. Intelligence. Ferocity.
A little blind and reckless at times...
but courageous beyond all doubt.
And one other trait that goes
with all previous.
- And that, Mr. President?
- Loneliness.
A bear lives out his life alone...
indomitable, unconquered,
but always alone.
He has no real allies, only enemies,
but none of them are as great as he.
Do you feel this might be
an American trait?
Certainly. The world will never love us.
It may respect us...
they may even grow to fear us,
but they will never love us.
For we have too much audacity...
and we're a bit blind
and reckless at times too.
Are you perhaps referring to the Panama
Canal and the situation in Morocco?
If you say so.
The American grizzly
embodies the spirit of America.
He should be our symbol,
not that ridiculous eagle.
He's no more than a dandified vulture.
Dandified.
- Do you speak English?
- Yes, sire.
Tell me, why doesn't the sultan
build the road to Fez?
I had to bring these lions by camel.
- Do you know what that's like?
- No, sire.
It wasn't easy.
The ease of others is not
the concern of the sultan.
- We'll build a road someday.
- A road? Here?
Foolish. The desert is like the sea.
You cannot build a road in the sea.
We will.
We have men that can do anything.
Absolutely anything.
- We have men that can fly.
- Fly?
Fly.
Watch the goal. Watch the goal.
Watch the goal.
Say, haven't I seen you
somewhere before?
Perhaps Your Highness
would care to fire the Maxim gun?
Herr Sultan is displeased?
This is broken. Mend it!
The ambassador of the American,
your exultancy.
I am Mulay Abd Al-Aziz,
sultan to Morocco.
It has been said that you
have brought me lions.
Yes, sir, two of them.
It's out of bounds.
It would please me to take the pleasure
of this meeting in my carriage of state.
You will come.
- Beautiful!
- It is quite extraordinary.
You may sit.
- You wish to discuss the Raisuli?
- Yes.
Have you made any contact
with his people?
He wishes for the return
of the woman Pedecaris...
that he be granted the lands
of the RIF by formal decree...
and that the Bashaw of Tangier's
head be presented in a golden jar.
- He didn't ask for money?
- Yes, but that is honorable.
- You have offered to pay it?
- Do not distress me by such a question.
See here, we will have
our people back and right quick...
or we will do something about it!
- I will not endure this treatment!
Have you ever heard
of the big stick, sultan?
There are squadrons of warships
in your coastal waters.
In days there will be Marines, cavalry
and artillery to enforce my demands.
Now, my country wants the woman
Pedecaris alive or Raisuli dead!
You cannot talk to the defender
of the faithful in this manner!
You do not understand it!
It is so difficult to be sultan.
You do not understand.
What do you know of this Raisuli?
He is a wonderful man,
a servant of God.
But he is a brigand
and a criminal as well.
He taught me to shoot a rifle
when I was 5 years old.
- You know him?
- He is my uncle.
But the Bashaw in Tangier
is your uncle.
They are both my uncles.
They are brothers.
It is so difficult to be sultan.
You foreigners do not understand.
These are my true riches.
A man's worth is counted
in the number of his rifles.
Does this Roosevelt?
Does he have such men?
Probably not.
Well, with such men, who needs guns
that fire many times promiscuously?
- Machine guns?
- Yes. Who needs such guns?
Well, maybe I don't believe it either.
Look at this.
Where'd you get it, William?
Did you steal it?
No, he gave it to me.
Gayaan the Terrible.
He's a brigand who's killed over 30 men.
Did he kill any with that?
Certainly.
- What will they do with us, William?
- Keep us.
Teach us to ride...
shoot...
cut men's throats...
and be brigands.
- Even girls?
- Yes, but you'll have to wear a veil.
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
That nobody can deny
That nobody can deny
That nobody can deny
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
That nobody can deny
- Happy birthday, Father!
- Happy birthday!
- Blow out the candles, Father!
- Takes a big wind, lots of hot air.
Then I'll need help
from you, Mr. Hay.
I propose a toast.
To the Panama Canal.
Yes, and Jupiter Pierpont Morgan.
Likie knifie? You likie forkie?
Splendid.
And now, Mr. President, blow.
May the breath of Theodore Roosevelt
be like the wind...
that he has sent across the Pacific.
Wind that bends the trees
of aggression and injustice.
But a true wind,
marked also for its warmth.
An American wind.
You likie speechie?
Well, I suppose I should make
the first cut here.
See? Nothing to it.
There you are.
See how easy that was?
Now you all go on and finish it.
- Not having any, Mr. President?
- Oh, no. No cake for me, John...
birthday or no.
I have to remain fit and trim,
vigorous and active.
After all, this Raisuli fellow is said to
be over 50 and still a formidable brigand.
You may well make
a formidable brigand yourself.
You've made a good start in life...
and we all have high hopes for you
when you grow up.
Now I shall have some of your cake.
Let them eat cake, huh, kid?
Not good for you, John.
Neither are those cigars.
I assure you, I can afford it.
Let me see that.
Take a note to the Winchester
Repeating Arms Company, New Haven.
Dear Sirs, I have received my improved
model 1895 Winchester in.405 caliber.
As you and I both know,
this is a very fine rifle.
However, once again,
you have blundered...
both in regard to the stock dimensions
and the recoil pad.
How long will these mistakes
be repeated?
I am the president
of the United States.
I see no reason why an American
president can't get satisfaction...
from an American gun maker!
What must I do for a proper fitting?
Go to England?
- I should hope not.
- No, sir.
Why are you standing there
like that, young man?
Speak up. This is a government,
not a rest home.
- What is it?
- Your bear, sir.
- My bear? What bear?
- Your grizzly bear, sir.
Oh, the Smithsonian! Yes, you have
the sketches. Thank you. Let's see.
Let's see these.
Oh, I'm sorry. That won't do.
No, that's... No, that's all wrong.
That's terrible. And that one...
You see, what's wrong here,
young man, is the position.
You've made this fine specimen
of a grizzly look like a hairy cow.
Now, would you like to be portrayed as
a hairy cow if you were a grizzly bear?
Perhaps the president
had a position in mind.
Certainly. There you are.
Now watch.
The American grizzly must always
be portrayed in a fighting stance.
That's the sort of animal he is,
upright, rampant, on his two hind feet.
His great forepaws extended like that.
Teeth bared, clawing, growling.
Understand?
Would you like to sketch that?
- Take a photograph.
- Good. Ready?
- Growl again, Father.
- You like that?
See that he gets a copy.
Now, where was I with Winchester?
"What must I do for a proper fitting?
Need I go to England?"
Oh, that's all right the way it is.
Send it out.
What must a man do, anyway,
to get a proper-fitting rifle?
You can bet that Raisuli fellow's
got a rifle that fits him.
Those people know the value
of a good weapon.
- The rifle is the very soul of the Arab.
- Raisuli's a Berber, Mr. President.
Well, it goes double for Berbers.
- What sort of rifle does he use?
- I don't know, sir.
Send him a cablegram. Find out what
kind of weapon the old bastard uses.
I think you're the best shot
that's ever occupied the office, sir.
Oh, I don't know. Andrew Jackson
back there was quite a shot.
Carried a brace of pistols
all the time, you know.
Shot a fellow right off the porch,
right out there.
Caned another one to death.
Admiral Chadwick, I presume.
I'm Vice Consul Richard Dreighton.
- Ray.
- Admiral. It's certainly good to see you.
Captain.
I must say, we've been awaiting your arrival
with a great deal of anticipation...
and I must say,
not a little nervousness.
You see, gentlemen,
what we have here...
is a problem of enormous
diplomatic complexity.
Now, the sultan of Morocco... Make
yourselves comfortable, gentlemen.
The sultan of Morocco
favors the German kaiser.
While the Bashaw,
who is the real power here...
is leaning toward the czar of Russia.
Now, in the middle of all this...
an American woman is kidnapped
by some desert pirate...
and our president, of course,
gentlemen, only wants to know...
what kind of a rifle
this brigand carries.
And he probably wants to build
a canal too, for all I know.
- It's been done before, you know.
- Now, now, admiral.
Mr. Dreighton, see if the gentlemen
care for a cigar. Would you, please?
You and I are both old men and we've
seen these disasters come and go.
Now, our problem is to make
this one go...
and make it look good.
I must remind you, sir,
that I was at Santiago Bay...
when this president
was running up San Juan Hill.
We'll have to do more than
just look good this time.
Well, what did you
have in mind, exactly?
Military intervention.
Yes. We are at this moment the most
powerful naval force in Tangier harbor.
Well, I don't see what that
has to do with anything.
We are a major power at this moment.
We carry the biggest stick.
Just how many men
do you have, captain?
- Two reinforced rifle companies, sir.
- Well, you see, the sultan of Morocco...
has three foreign regiments in Fez.
- That's right, sir. They're at Fez.
The Bashaw has only his
household cavalry and guard here.
The power lies with the Bashaw.
Who is this boy?
Let him go on.
We'd be as useless chasing Raisuli as
the redcoats on Bunker Hill.
And the sultan, if I'm correct in my
assumption, will not meet his demands.
Yes, go on.
The sultan is not the power.
The real government is here.
That's right.
It would seem quite obvious, sir.
We must seize the government
and make our own negotiations.
- Seize the government?
- At bayonet point!
I certainly would like to see
that old son of a bitch at bayonet point.
But it's ridiculous.
It's outrageous. It's lunatic!
Yes, isn't it, though?
I should think Teddy would love it.
What about the French,
the Germans, the British?
- Why, we're in the shadow of Gibraltar.
- Damn the legations!
You realize, of course, that if we fail
in this in even the slightest way...
we'll all be killed.
Yes. And the whole world
will probably go to war.
Gentlemen, if we fail and are killed...
I certainly hope
that the world does go to war.
World at war.
A world war.
Now that would be something
to go out on.
William. Jennifer. Jennifer!
What is it, Mama? I was sleeping.
Dress quickly in the robes
they gave you.
- Why are you dressed like that?
- Where are we going?
- We're going to make good an escape.
- An escape?
Right now? I was asleep.
You cannot wait for these things
to occur at your convenience, Jennifer.
Now, I've bribed a man with jewels.
Come on. Get dressed. Hurry up.
Come along. Be quick about it!
The rifle, boy. Rifle!
- Yes, it is mine.
- Give me your rifle. Give it to me, yeah?
You'll get the rifle when we reach safety
and not before. Now move ahead.
I'll take the rifle, Willy.
Be careful!
- Help!
- William!
William. William.
Mama!
William!
Get back!
William, get those loose horses there.
Quick.
Jennifer, go with William.
Mrs. Pedecaris,
you're a great deal of trouble.
There is all that you need here.
Clothes of the finest silks, spiced meats,
figs for you, when you wish to eat.
- Scented water to bathe in.
- But where are your guards?
Is it your intention to let us
roam about freely?
You're the guests of the Raisuli...
in the Raisuli's house.
I don't need guards.
My eyes are with you wherever you go.
Allah is with me.
No one can escape from God.
What will you do if they do not
accept your terms?
What do you mean?
What will become of us,
my children and myself?
I will play chess with you one more time
and then return you to your house.
Alive?
Yes, of course.
Then you're just bluffing them.
You've never had
the intention of killing us.
Raisuli does not kill women and children.
That's a silly question.
Why do you do this?
Because I am bluffing too.
Mrs. Pedecaris, you trouble me.
Ship, oars!
Present arms!
Good morning, sir.
The company is formed.
Sergeants, take your post.
Company...
fix bayonets.
Move!
Right face!
Port arms!
Column left, march!
Column right, march!
Eyes...
right!
I don't think the French and Germans
are gonna like this.
Too early in the morning
for rattling sabers.
Double-time...
march!
Right on me.
Column left, now!
Column left, march!
Column left!
- Quick-time...
- Quick-time!
march!
Third and fourth squads,
column right, march.
First and second squads,
column right, march.
Mark time...
march!
Company...
halt!
Hostiles to the left.
Left face!
Firing positions, move!
Aim!
Fire!
Prepare to charge the palace.
Charge!
Capt. Jerome,
United States Marine Corps.
And you are my prisoner, sir.
You are a very dangerous man,
captain.
And your President Roosevelt is mad.
Yes, sir.
He's gone cowboy again.
Stand back.
Let me deal with him, or try.
Theodore, what are you doing?
Isn't that the czar?
A facsimile.
That's like shooting
at your own brother.
Oh, Kermit's in the pits.
That's his idea of a little joke.
Obviously, you relish jokes in view of
your approval of the Gummere report.
I try to go along with them, John.
I suppose a declaration of war
would be a joke too?
You have to admit,
it would be entertaining.
A barrel of laughs.
Have you any idea of the risk
you're running?
Have you any idea of the territory
I'd be gaining?
Theodore.
You're dangerous.
You might even shoot somebody.
Accidentally, I mean.
John, I'd never shoot anyone
accidentally. I need their votes.
Madness.
- Madness.
- Sir?
Utter madness.
Why are you closing your left eye?
You told us to shoot with both eyes open.
The light bothers me.
I can't see out of that eye anymore.
- What do you mean?
- I'm blind in my left eye.
- Since when?
- Saturday. Boxing.
Now don't say anything
to Edith about it. Do you hear?
Maybe it'll go away.
And don't let anyone come up
on my left side either.
Father, is Raisuli a real pirate?
Yes, Quentin, he's the last
of the Barbary pirates.
Why do you say that?
Well, the world is fast outgrowing
pirates, of that sort anyway.
Do you know any others?
Yes, J.P. Morgan.
He's the only other real pirate I know.
I hope you have him brought
before you in chains.
- J.P. Morgan? I should hardly think so.
- No, have Raisuli brought before you.
I should like to see that.
Oh, I should like to see him too,
but not in chains.
Let's have the Winchester, Alice.
You like him. Don't you, Father?
You like J.P. Morgan too. Don't you?
Of course I do, Alice.
But they're your enemies.
Well, sometimes one finds
that your enemies...
are a lot more admirable
than your friends.
You pick the road to greatness,
and you'll have that choice someday.
You come to realize that
the road traveled by great men...
is dark and lonely and lit only
at intervals by other great men.
And sometimes they're your enemies.
But they're the only true luxury
you have.
Yes, it's a dark and difficult road...
and I do not look down upon anyone
who has the good sense not to take it.
I was young and full of the sayings
of young men.
I did not yet understand the ways
of the prophet, the will of God.
I thought that men could oppose
such will. I was very foolish.
A man can trust no one,
yet often trusts women.
I trusted my brother and openly
opposed the old sultan at Fez.
He let the Europeans
give him money...
and money is always followed
by more Europeans.
My brother betrayed me,
and I was sent to Mogador.
Mogador?
It is a dungeon on the edge of the sea.
I was sent there to die,
but I was young and strong.
My brain was as agile as my fingers.
The confinement,
speak of the confinement.
It was the intention of my brother to let
the flies and the ants consume me.
But as the years passed...
and the chains were replaced
many times...
it was always I who remained.
It was then that the guards saw
that the Baraka was with me.
They arranged my escape.
I thanked them for the years of wisdom
they had given me.
And I wandered into the mountains.
- Are you asleep?
- No, did I look like it?
No, but you made no noise, and others
have fallen asleep while I speak.
The wandering, Raisuli.
Yeah. I wandered into the mountains.
I wished only to hear the voices
of women...
babbling about common things.
You permit me to say, the conversation
of women does not interest me much.
But when one is in prison...
one is inclined to have
a different sense of disposition.
The Rifians found me.
I learned to read and to speak again.
The women aided me in this
because of my lineage...
but the men...
they wanted to sell my head to the
old sultan at Fez for rifles and gold.
There was but one thing to do,
challenge Abdel Malak the Cruel.
We fought with swords on horseback.
And the Baraka was with me.
I cut off his arm.
And he wounded me...
many times.
The tribesmen judged him,
and every voice was against him.
And his eyes, which had witnessed
much injustice...
were burned out
with heated copper coins.
And today he wanders the land
a blind beggar.
Thus I became the true defender
of the faithful...
for the blood of the prophet runs in me,
and I am but an instrument of his will.
Raisuli, lord of the RIF,
Salaam. Salaam.
I have never seen
such fierce retainers.
Well, these are my immortals.
- They have...
- Put that down!
Let it be!
They are feared in hell...
and their courage is such that
golden thrones await them in paradise.
You are pleased, sherif?
I am pleased the Raisuli
will be pleased.
The Bashaw offers this:
70,000 pieces of Spanish gold.
All foreign soldiers to be removed
from the RIF...
and the Raisuli and his followers
are to be granted the freedom...
to travel in the cities
and marketplaces.
And last, all those held
in the dungeons of Mogador...
who swear fealty to Raisuli
shall be placed under Raisuli's care.
This in return for the American woman
and her children.
It is the word of the American sultan
Roosevelt, and his honor.
Even with treachery,
such an offer is impressive.
The American Bashaw wished
that the Raisuli act in haste...
as the Europeans aren't pleased.
- You must take their offer!
Each day you keep us here...
the Europeans use as an excuse
to land more troops.
Everything that you have fought for
is wasted!
They are using you, Raisuli!
- You are becoming a dupe to them.
- Do not call the Raisuli a dupe!
- I do not need the counsel of women.
- The American woman is true.
Every day more Germans travel
to Fez.
They have guns that need wheels
to carry them.
What is stopping you?
Can't you see?
It is no longer our concern.
The great powers want this land,
and they will fight for it.
When they're done
there'll be nothing...
not your mountains, nor your palace,
not pride, nor honor!
It is a wind so strong
no tree can stand in it!
And where there are no trees,
there is no shade from the sun.
And what is land without shade
from the sun?
Desert.
The desert I know very well.
Mrs. Pedecaris,
you speak like a Berber.
It must be the heat.
Why do you do this?
I do not ordinarily ask the counsel
of any man...
let alone the counsel of women.
You're not even one of my wives!
I should certainly say not.
I am not!
Children, come here.
We have no more business here.
Let these brigands decide
what they shall do with us.
Mrs. Pedecaris, I have decided
it would please me...
to return you
to President Roosevelt...
because you're a lot of trouble!
Perhaps he will know what to do
with you. It is not my fate to find out.
- Even you laugh at the Raisuli.
- This woman has taken the Raisuli.
You say such things
in front of my men.
What has become of honor, respect?
Everything is changing,
drifting away on the wind.
It's been a bad year.
The next one will probably be worse.
Where do we take them
to get our gold?
I will take them. Do not risk your life.
What does my life matter?
I've nothing else to do.
Prepare to ride.
I do not understand this woman.
My entire education has been horses
and the Koran.
What have I learned?
Look what I've become.
You are lord of the RIF.
Yes, and you would think
I would understand this woman.
Where exactly are we going?
To a small village east of Rabat
at the foot of the mountains.
- It is good.
- What is good?
It is good to know where we are going.
What are they singing?
They are singing songs to God.
Why are you not singing?
I am the sultan. They do the singing.
That is ridiculous!
It is customary.
There is just one thing
I'd like to ask you.
Yes, what is it?
What is your first name?
- My first name?
- Yes, your Christian name.
I mean, what is the name
that precedes all your other names?
My first name?
My Christian name?
I am Mulay Achmed Mohammed Raisuli
the Magnificent, lord of the RIF.
Mulay. Mulay, that is a nice name.
Yes.
Mulay. I am Eden, Mulay.
Eden. Of course.
You need not go any further.
My retainers will bring back the gold.
What good is the word
of the Roosevelt...
if it is not met by the word
of the Raisuli?
My brother knows this.
I do not fear treachery or fate.
I fear only God.
It is foolish and silly to talk as such.
These Europeans are not men.
They do not respect the laws of men.
Let me take the woman.
He is right.
It is no longer your concern.
No longer my concern?
It is I who took you.
It pleased me to do so.
It pleases me now to bring you back.
No longer my concern.
Sharif, bring your retainers.
The woman, Pedecaris,
must not be endangered.
She must return
to President Roosevelt.
If there is to be treachery, Allah
will not leave my side, but you must.
Ride back, lead the mahalla,
let there be jihad.
Let the swords run with the blood
of the infidels.
We will all eat lamb in paradise.
Throw down your arms!
They obey only my will,
and I am the Raisuli.
I am Mrs. Pedecaris. I do not want
my family endangered any further.
Mrs. Pedecaris. Capt. Jerome,
U.S. Marine Corps.
- Help the children.
- Yes, ma'am.
Better take cover inside, ma'am.
Inside. Inside.
I am the sherif of Wazan.
These are my retainers.
They do not ride with this brigand.
Take him if you want!
What will they do to him?
That can't be our concern, ma'am.
We're quite outnumbered here.
Let's go inside.
I expect gold and rifles for his head.
I do not do this for a lackey's wages!
- Can't we get out of here?
- Not until it's light, ma'am.
I wouldn't trust these sorts in the dark.
Mother. Mother, aren't you going
to do anything about the Raisuli?
William, the Raisuli is not our concern.
Aren't you gonna do anything?
Go to sleep, William.
Mother.
William!
William.
William, have you got your dagger?
Captain.
Captain, could you bring
us some water, please?
Of course, ma'am.
Here we go.
For the boy first, captain,
he has a fever.
Here, son, hold your head up.
There we go.
Oh, man!
Don't any of you move!
I shall cut this man's throat
if you do not do as I say.
I am not fooling!
Now, drop those weapons!
- You could hurt somebody...
- Don't touch that!
William, get them. Jennifer, help him.
Get the pistols too.
William, give me the short one.
Get up.
Easy with that thing, ma'am.
I have shot grouse in Scotland
and quail in North Carolina.
Believe me,
I know how to use this thing.
What are you doing?
What are you trying to get across?
President Roosevelt made
an agreement with that man there...
and President Roosevelt
keeps agreements!
Now, there's no need to do this.
We're all Americans here.
- What exactly did you have in mind?
- I intend to free the Raisuli.
- Alone, I suppose.
- With my children.
Well, I wish you'd said that
in the first place.
If you're gonna try it alone, with your
children, you haven't got a chance.
What do you suggest I do then,
captain?
I'd like to throw in with you.
And God help us.
Draw your weapons from the boy here.
Check for a full load.
My pistol, please.
Halt!
We want to see your prisoner.
I said we want to see your prisoner.
We want to see the Raisuli. President
Roosevelt negotiated in good faith!
What are you doing?
Let's go!
Hurry up! Cover us!
- Oh, my God!
- Mrs. Pedecaris.
The Baraka has not deserted me.
Cut me down quick, before it does.
The sword, woman! The sword!
Better.
Oh, my... Are you hurt?
Mrs. Pedecaris, you're a lot of trouble.
I'll see you again, Mrs. Pedecaris...
when we're both
like golden clouds on the wind.
There was nothing to worry about,
John.
All I have to do is go to
Oyster Bay for the week end...
and the government of Morocco falls.
- By the way, how is Mrs. Pedecaris?
- In fine health, sir.
Quite a remarkable woman.
Capt. Jerome said during the fighting
she displayed commendable courage.
That Jerome, I want him
decorated with something.
Whatever you think is appropriate.
And Gummere and... What's his name?
Decorate the outfit, all of them.
I say, Theodore,
you should thank your lucky stars.
Luck had nothing to do with it.
I had God on my side.
Maybe Allah.
- What's that?
- That's your bear. Your grizzly bear, sir.
First reports are we can get
anything we want in Morocco, sir.
Coaling rights. We can
put anybody on the throne.
Their camps were divided.
At this moment, Theodore is
the most popular president in history.
- Take that cover off.
- What, sir?
Take the cover off.
I wanna see my bear.
- Later perhaps, Theodore.
- No, I want to see him now.
A good speech would be appropriate
soon. Even the papers are cheering you.
There's no doubt about
the outcome of the election.
Gentlemen, nothing in this
world is certain, absolutely nothing.
The fate of the nation will be decided
by the people in November.
And the fate of Morocco
will be decided tomorrow by me.
Now, gentlemen, if you don't mind,
I'd just like to be alone with my bear.
I trust he was a Democrat.
To Theodore Roosevelt.
You are like the wind,
and I like the lion.
You form the tempest.
The sand stings my eyes
and the ground is parched.
I roar in defiance,
but you do not hear.
But between us there is a difference.
I, like the lion, must remain in my place.
While you, like the wind,
will never know yours.
Mulay Achmed Mohammed
El-Raisuli the Magnificent...
lord of the RIF,
sultan to the Berbers.
Great Raisuli, we have lost everything.
All is drifting on the wind,
just as you said.
We have lost everything!
Sharif, is there not one thing in your life
that was worth losing everything for?
Thank you for downloading!
