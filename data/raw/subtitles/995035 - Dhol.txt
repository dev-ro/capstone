Zikomo's world is that of crime.
My man who knows it inside out,
how can I let go of him?
If he wants to leave... still
I can't let him go.
Those who stay with Zikomo...
they die with Zikomo!
She is breathing her last!
Still mother doesn't
want to see my face!
She is asking for an oath.
I can't carry this burden
all my life! Now let me go!
I beg you! Please! Let me go!
Leave!

Paresh!
- What?
How much more time for
half a cup of tea?
Yes! Do you go to Assam
to get the tea leaves?
Or to the cow's shed
to bring the milk?
What's the hurry! Till evening
you people will sit here!
Get lost!
Help!
Hey! Pakiya! Hey! Pakiya!
What happened? What happened?
Somebody is abducting a girl!
Come on! Hurry up! Hurry up!
Come on, let's go.
- That girl was crying.
Come on! Come on! Sit! Sit!
Come on, sit fast.
Drive carefully!
Stop the car! Stop the car!
Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop!
Do something, Goti!
- I am telling them to stop!
Hey, do you think you
are riding a plane?
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop!
You!
Scoundrel!
Scoundrel!
You are abducting a girl! Scoundrel!
Scoundrel!
Sam, what are you doing? There
is another one inside!
Beat him! Beat him!
Come on! Come on! - Hurry up!
My stomach
is aching a lot!
Come on! Quickly take
me to the hospital!
Goti, run!
"Drum! Drum! Drum!"
This is the limit!
- Brother-in-law, it's hurting!
This is the limit! Useless!
What are you doing? Why
are you beating him?
What has he done?
Do you want to know
what he has done?
I have caught your
brother red-handed.
5 liters of petrol used
to be enough for a week!
Last week thrice my
vehicle broke down!
So take it to the garage,
to some mechanic!
Why are you beating him?
This is the limit!
My vehicle is fine!
Your useless brother! You have
spoiled him with your love!
He was stealing petrol
from my vehicle...
...and transferring it in his bike!
I caught him! And ask him!
Where does he go early in
the morning all decked up?
What does he do? Ask him!
My shoes! My belt! And
for the past 3 months...
... my three underwear
too have vanished.
I don't want a thief
in my house! No!
Don't call Pankaj a thief!
I will call him without hesitation!
Why shouldn't I say it?
He is living off my earnings
without any shame!
If he earns a single penny
on his own merit...
...then I will praise him!
Till then I will call him a thief,
a robber, a dacoit!
And when the need arises,
I will inscribe here...
...that my brother-in-law is a thief!
Don't aggravate the matter!
Today you have to choose!
Either banish him or
me from the house!
Get lost! Robber! Go on robbing!
Stop the bike! A girl!
Stop it! Stop!
Hi, Kanika!
- Hi, Kanu!
How was your day? You
look very tired!
Hey! Get down! Get down!
Kanu, you must have seen bones
in your medical college!
Someday count his!
Come! I will give you a lift!
You are already carrying a person!
I told you! Move!
- Fine!
Move!
- Fine! Fine!
God has given me feet!
I will go on my own!
She is going on foot!
Bye!
Come on! Otherwise she
will come! Come on!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Hey! Stop!
Give my rent!
Aunt, we...
Two months rent is pending
including this month's!
Come on! Give my rent! Give my rent!
First hear today's breaking news!
We will get a fixed job!
- And what about you?
We...
- Aunt is joking! Aunt is joking!
Aunt joked...
Aunt, our salary is going
to increase 5 times.
You are lying!
Forgot the provident fund?
Yes! Now no poverty!
I will pay one year's
rent in advance!
Because this house is
very lucky for me!
But since the time you people have...
...stepped into my house,
my bad times have begun.
We too will marry soon! So
many people are after us!
Why? To handcuff you?
No! We are receiving alliances
from affluent families.
I don't know about you.
But I won't give money!
I want an educated, nice
and a working woman.
If her name starts from letter
K, then it will be better!
Fool! What are you hearing?
Go inside! Go inside!
Look! Now you people can't fool me!
No matter what the job is, if
I don't receive the rent...
...within a week, then I will
surely lock your room.
And what is going on in my house?
First you both were there! After
that another idiot arrived!
And now a girl and a boy!
Get rid of them right away!
Otherwise I...
Which girl? - Which boy?
What do I know! You go and check!
He is my friend Gopi! He works
in a printing press.
And she is...
Come out! I will tell you. This way!
Come! Come! Come here!
Listen... it's a love affair.
They have eloped.
Gopi is just like us. Pocket
without any money.
And no comb for his hair.
And Neha is a billionaire.
But it's futile now.
Because she has eloped.
And her rich father
is after Gopi's life!
And they have no place to hide.
I thought generous people like
you can help two lovers. So...
No, no, no!
We can't do anything!
We can't do anything!
Just for 2 days!
- No way! No way! No way!
That witch won't spare us!
I have promised them!
That's it! Take back your words!
Hang on! Hang on!
He lives at his sister's place!
Yes!
- Why don't you keep them there?
Because now that is
no longer my house.
My brother-in-law banished
me from his home.
Who?
- My brother-in-law!
I have made arrangement
of a room with a friend...
...who has gone out for 2 months.
After he returns, I will come here.
What! What do you guys
think of this house?
Look! Look at this idiot!
How is he sleeping!
As if his father has
given him this bed!
He has made this house
a charitable house!
Listen! Listen! Listen! Listen!
Will you tell them or shall
I tell them? - Listen...
Will you tell them?
- Listen...
Will you tell them?
- Listen to me!
Friend... Pakiya has told us
everything. But it's difficult.
Just for 2 days.
After court marriage, nobody's
father can do anything.
But where will you both
live after marriage?
How will you people survive?
I will live on the street...
but with Gopi.
When I fell in love, I didn't
know Gopi is so poor.
Now what difference does it make?
For a girl the most important
thing is love.
Once she falls in love, then
whether the guy is rich or poor...
...a robber or anything else, what
difference does it makes?
He should just truly love her.
I swear. Not even in my dream
had I thought that...
... Neha will love me so much.
If dreams have to come true,
it comes true.
Let it be. We don't
want to trouble you.
We will seek somebody else's help.
Something will surely materialise.
Let's go. - Okay.
Thanks, man!
- Sorry!
Thanks!
One trouble over another trouble.
Hey! You have your uncle's house!
You have your uncle's job!
Still you remain here the whole day!
Get up! Make tea!
At times do respect the real
owner of the house! Pauper!
Take out the book!
Settle the account!
Tell me! How much?
1000 of Pandey the vegetable vendor.
1500 interest. Close it.
What?
- Close his account.
And this is 3084 rupees 50 paisa
of Daya, the butcher.
And...
Look! This is 8000 rupees
of Satish, the sweeper!
But add this in bribery account,
not loan account!
He wants to become a manager.
There is a shortage of 102 rupees!
So why are you bullying me?
This is that cruel man's
money, not yours!
You just note it down! Don't
interfere in my matters!
He takes police's salary!
He accepts bribery.
And he acts as a moneylender!
Meaning benefit from all deals!
He will go to hell! Will he take
his money along with him?
Who? Who will take my money?
Sir, Maru has brought
102 rupees less.
102! 102!
Where did you spend so much money?
I had gone to recover the loan.
So 60 rupees for the auto's fare.
Auto! I will kill you!
Greetings. - Did you give
the money? -Yes! - Fine!
You are a pauper and you want
to lead a king's life!
My sister has given
you such strong feet!
It's not for begging on the streets!
Where is the rest of the money?
Where is the rest...
I had some snacks!
Snacks! One banana is for 2 rupees.
Half a cup of tea is 2 rupees.
It adds to 4 rupees! What did you
do with the rest of the money?
Listen, Chaudhary!
Don't give him any money for a week!
Uncle, I will die!
I have not stopped your supply
of air! Doing drama!
Come on! Sit at the
betel shop! Come on!
And listen, I have counted
the betel leaves.
If you will chew even one,
then I won't spare you!
And listen! From tomorrow you
will go to recover the loan!
Get a cup of coffee!
Isn't he Paresh? Wasn't
he the waiter?
Yes! Yes! I will tell him!
Pant, shirt and tie! How come
he is dressed up so finely?
Hey Paresh, come here!
One cold coffee!
- Okay, sir!
What new form is this?
What good deeds would I have earned
by working as a waiter?
So I started my own business!
- Wow! What business?
I have opened a hardware shop!
From where did you get the money?
Did you commit robbery?
I got it from the bank!
Go to the bank, fill the
loan application form...
...and you will get the money.
It means anybody can ask for
a loan and they get it?
Is it a bank or Shirdi's Sai Baba?
You should just have a shop!
Did you see that? Gradually
they will reveal things.
They want this! Then they want that!
Nothing! Just a shop in a nice area.
The bank will give you
4 lakhs as loan.
From that give 2 lakhs to
the company, as a deposit.
Then go to any company!
Be it a soap company or a
stationary company. Okay.
The company will give you
goods worth 5 lakhs.
Nowadays people buy
things so quickly.
They way white ants eat the wood.
So it will take maximum 1
month to sell the goods.
The profit is 20% . So how
much is monthly profit?
1 lakhs!
How much is the bank loan?
- 4 lakhs!
Yes! So within 4 months,
you will repay the loan.
In the 5th month, the shop is yours.
In the 6th month, you
will have 1 lakhs.
And in the 7th month...
- Stop! Stop!
Repeat what all things
are to be done!
Fill the loan forms. Sign it.
Then the shop's papers, the Xerox...
...and 10- 12 Xerox copies of
the ration card and passport.
File the papers neatly.
And express your good
intention to the bank.
Okay.
You will get it.
You sign on this form.
Bring the shop's documents,
and take the loan.
But from where will we get
the shop's documents?
Fool!
What name will we keep for our shop?
Collage of colours!
Hey! The name should be easily
pronounceable. - Spit!
At last you have shown your status!
Keep this name for your
betel shop! Spit!
Money! Money! Money! From
where will we get it?
No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no!
Uncle won't give!
If you want money, then
sell me or mortgage me!
But don't take uncle's name!
He is that wicked man who can...
... pull out teeth from
the corpse's mouth!
He will give you money? You
are weaving such a dream!
Then wake up!
Listen!
I told you! He won't listen!
How long will you endure
uncle's beatings?
And he loves the lizard in
his house more than you!
Because he doesn't have to
incur any expense for it.
Even if you die for him,
he won't light your pyre!
He will leave you in the jungle!
Because it will save his money!
Yes! And why all this? Because
you are his slave!
Become our partner! 25000 per month!
Think! How much will
you earn in a year!
Money means respect!
Respect means fame!
You will sit in commissioner
and minister's company!
Your uncle will look worthless in
front of them! Think about it!
When you will stand in front
of that pauper uncle...
...glowing with wealth,
then how will it look?
Think! Think!
Very nice!
But what will you mortgage?
Do you have anything besides
four underwear and vest?
Yes!
- What?
I have a plan!
What name did you say?
- Sunil Mehta!
What is his relationship
with your friend?
He is his brother-in-law!
Uncle, he has a nice
house and a nice job.
But I told him clearly. No
friendship in business.
It should be give and take!
- What! Clap?
No, uncle! Jewellery!
Gold jewellery!
You will have the jewellery.
They will have the money.
If they can't repay the money...
Then I will dig your friend's
grave! Remember! Got it?
Bribery money is not a joke!
Hard earned money is earned
just with toil.
Bribery is earned
with toil and risk.
Uncle, if there is a problem,
you can sell the jeweller...
...and recover the money.
Do you accept it?
First I will see the house!
Then I will decide.
If there is any blunder,
I won't spare you.
On what basis is he
giving the money?
What have you guys mortgaged?
- Maru!
He is Maru's uncle!
He is a nice man!
We decided to start a business!
And he said he wants to finance.
We refused so he said to
take money on credit.
But we will have to pay
the interest every week.
There is no worry, sister.
We will earn abundant profit!
Teach your brother-in-law
something. I will feel content. Move!
Sister.
- Yes.
He is helping us so much.
Give him sweets personally.
Please. It weighs 2 kilos.
It has gold foil.
Is that so? Earlier
it used to be silver.
Give this sweet to him personally.
And take the money from
him and give it to us!
Along with the blessings. That's
why we have come here.
Door!
- He has come! Come on! Come on!
Here comes the scoundrel!
- He has come!
Greetings.
Come.
The house is nice.
The furniture belongs to them
or have they rented it?
They own it, uncle.
Please sit! I will go and call
sister! Sister! Sister!
Who are they both?
- They are humans.
They look like devils to me.
- Two friends.
He and he and he. All
three are friends.
I have brought the money.
You have to pay the interest every
week at the rate of 10%!
The day you can't pay the interest...
...that day no gold.
Sister, he is uncle. Uncle,
she is sister.
Greetings. You are helping
them so much.
I am really pleased.
Thank you so much.
Even I am happy. After all I am
going to take the interest.
You are really generous. They
were praising you a lot.
Sister, give him the box.
Yes! Take this!
Jewellery!
- I see!
How much?
- 2!
2 kilos! 2 kilos!
Gold?
- Yes! Foil! Gold foil!
Yes! It's gold! Nowadays
silver is not used!
Thank you. Here.
You keep this with you. Please
get coffee for uncle.
Pankaj!
- Go and get it! Keep it! Coffee!
Here is the agreement.
And the shop's key.
Now for a year the shop is yours.
You can either do business
or hold discourses.
It won't make any difference to me!
No, no, no! I can't
give you the loan!
What are you saying?
The bald manager before you said...
...to show the showroom agreement
and take the loan.
Yes!
- He was bald! I am not!
How will we repay uncle's loan?
Shut up! Don't do that!
We will be ruined!
We have taken a loan at high rate
of interest for the showroom!
Look, if you didn't
give us the loan...
...then our lives will
become miserable!
I can't give the loan! This
is my final decision!
Why? Does this bank
belong to your uncle?
Get out! Get out, you fools!
Hey!
Hey...
What happened? - What happened?
Why are you crying inconsolably?
- He beat me!
Who beat you?
He hit me here! He hit me here!
And I don't know where
else he beat me!
If you won't say, then
how will we find out!
Tell me! Who beat you! We
won't spare him! Tell me!
Give us his name!
Uncle!
- Uncle!
Uncle beat you!
Uncle won't spare you all!
Till the time you all
don't repay his loan...
...I can't return home.
What do you mean?
As if we have invested the
money in lucrative deals!
What is that scoundrel saying!
Here I am suffering!
Do you know... that monster had
taken me to the dispensary!
That's a good thing!
It's a good thing!
- Don't pounce on me!
He wanted to sell my kidney!
- Did he remove it?
I ran away from there!
Now just watch!
Your eyes, ears, nose, nails,
he will remove everything...
...and he will sell it in his shop!
Just watch! Just watch!
Don't sit like this! I am getting
tense. Say something.
Hail Mother India!
What is it's connection
to this matter?
You said to say something.
So I said it.
Shall I say something else too?
Look! Look! Who has come!
- Uncle!
Who is it? Has some hero come?
Is there a shooting?
Tell me!
Isn't he your friend... who had
come home with his girlfriend.
Gopi! Hi!
Hi!
Hello!
- You and here?
My office is here.
- Here!
By the way... we have got married.
Is this car too yours?
From where did you
find this treasure?
From my father-in-law!
He was after your life!
- Yes!
He changed after marriage. Now
I look after his business.
Great! Is he your father-in-law
or a coin?
He changed so soon?
After marriage parents
have no other choice.
They have to give their consent!
Well, at times immediately!
At times after becoming
grandparents!
But their heart does melt.
Thanks for the support. Bye!
We will meet again! - Okay!
Bye, guys!
- Bye! - Bye!
This is called having
the perfect horoscope!
Horoscope is all crap!
If you have guts, then
God will help you!
Wrong pronunciation!
- Yes!
And what did he do?
Enticing a rich girl!
God helped him!
He is leading a luxurious life!
Meaning we too... if we
too find a rich girl...
...then our lives too
will become set!
Yes! But from where will we
get the girl? From the sky?
Fool! Sitting idle is futile!
We will have to toil and work
hard! And then watch!
He will... He will surely
send the right girl.
From the sky.

Hey! Cut it! Sam!
What happened? - What happened?
What happened?
In your neighbourhood.
- There is a fire!
No! A bomb shell has arrived!
- What!
Really! Who?
A grandma!
And a grandpa too!
So the grandpa is a bomb shell
- No!
I will smash your mouth!
No! There is a granddaughter too!
Fair body!
Mesmerizing eyes! And soft tresses!
Wow!
Immediately after seeing her, I ran
breathlessly to tell you all!
Wow!
Meaning we searched far
and wide for her.
And we found her in
our neighbourhood.
Wow, Maru!
As soon as I saw her, I thought
I will inform you all!
You did the right thing!
I have found my gal!
Now you people search
a gal for yourselves!
Hey!
- Betrayal!
We were searching for
the girl together.
Now we will entice her together.
- Yes!
But won't this be injustice?
One girl and we all are four!
So what? Didn't we run after the
same kite when we were kids!
It's the same thing!
We will try together!
The lucky person will get the girl!
- Yes!
The rest will clear the way
without any fight! - Yes!
Is it okay?
- Yes!
Shake hands!
Where is she? Come!
She has come!
You people fight! Let me see her!
Can you see the face?
Who cares for the face? The
rest of the body is fabulous!
This is my binocular!
If you want to see her,
then buy another one!
Her and my pair will be perfect!
What is going on?
No, no! We thought a
thief has entered!
So we were just watching! I swear!
How can a thief enter that place?
When dacoits live here!
No! These guys are not
like that, aunt!
I am talking about you!
Come out! Come on!
Come out! Come out!
Where is the 4th one?
- Coming!
Coming! Since when you people
have been delaying!
We will pay the money today.
Tomorrow we will become rich!
I don't want to hear anything!
Now my 4 men will come and
throw your belongings out!
Got it?
Then whether you live on the
railway platform or the streets!
That's your problem!
Here is your money!
- Okay!
What is this? Where
is this month's rent?
This month is still not over!
- Fine! Fine!
From where did you get the money?
Money saved for the shop!
Your papa is in Afghanistan,
isn't he? - Yes!
A war is going on there!
- Yes!
All Indians have returned
home except your papa.
Do you know why?
- Why?
Because of this!
She went away!
- Where?
Hang on! Hang on!
- Give!
Hey!
Hey!
I too want to see!
Maru, wait!
"Showery sky."
"My heart is a tormentor."
"On the lonely paths."
"What did you find?"
Why were you all howling
like foxes? Why?
I must have lost my good sense...
...when I gave this flat to you all!
No peace day and night!
Useless fellows!
You people just loiter around!
But the rest of the world
works. Let them sleep!
Since when you people are croaking!
If... I heard a single noise...
then... in a jiffy...
...I will throw you
all in the ravine!
She...
Sam! Come quickly! Goti, you
too come! Come quickly! Look!
Your name is Goti!
To hell with the name! Look there!
What a sight!
Let me climb!
Let me also climb!
Get down!
- Why?
I said get down! Come on!
What are you doing?
Get down!
- Why?
I said get down!
Learn to respect your seniors!
First we will watch! You
both will watch later!
Come on!
Come on!
Shall we go?
Don't just sit on the tree!
If you see somebody,
just whistle! Fine?
Maru!
- Yes!
You are under the oath!
When she finishes half
her bath, come back!
Yes! We will watch the other half!
- Yes!
Till then stay there! Stay there!
Leave me!
Come on! Come on!
What? What? What?
It has been so long! Why
have they still not come?
Forget watching the
girl taking a bath!
We won't even be able
to see a drop of water!
It's so itchy!
In the graveyard...
Come on! Come on! Come on!
You sat!
- Yes!
It's four hands are moving
towards the girl.
What happened?
What do I know? I too have been
standing here with you!
Something must have happened!
-Why are they screaming!
They must be in trouble!
Let's run away! - Yes!
Look! Look there!
Run! Run! Run!
Hold!
Grandpa, you are still not ready!
I will leave. You come
there in your car.
Okay! I am coming!
"I am hungry."
"I am hungry."
She saw me!
No, no, no! She saw me and not you!
How do you know? She
had worn goggles!
She didn't see you!
She didn't see you!
She didn't see anybody!
She saw me! She saw me!
He! - She didn't see me!
And she will see you!
She should have seen once!
4 handsome guys were
standing for her!
Not 4, three.
If not 3 or 2, then there
was at least one.
We all four are not so handsome!
So we won't argue about
how we look like!
We have to think about how
to make the girl notice us!
Yes!
I can see!
- What?
Where? Where? Where?
- Has she again returned!
I can see a way!
- Today just speak up!
Let's entice the old lady!
- What?
Carefully! Carefully!
- Yes!
Greetings, grandma!
Oh my God!
No, no, no!
He will put us into trouble
too! Let's run away!
No, no! Old lady, have you gone mad!
What are you doing? I will die!
Maru! Maru!
I won't spare you!
- Help!
Pakiya! Mummy! I am dead! Mummy!
Goti, don't yell! We
will be in trouble!
First pour water! My
eyes are burning!
Here! Bring the bucket!
Bring the bucket!
Pour water!
- Hurry up!
Pour water!
- Come on!
Pour water! Not on my chest!
My eyes are burning!
Come on! Bend! You are so tall!
What are you doing?
Pour water!
Deceivers! What kind of
friends are you all!
When I was in trouble,
you all run away!
I have learnt my lesson! Now I
will stay away from you people!
What did we know that
you are in trouble?
Sam! Did you know that
he is in trouble?
No! Maru, did you know?
- Yes, yes!
What did you know?
He means to say no!
Idiots! Didn't you people
hear my screams?
You were screaming?
We thought you and grandma
were laughing loudly!
Idiots! I am lucky that I still
have my head on my shoulder!
Otherwise she had attacked thrice
with the knife! Here! Here!
What would have happened?
Nothing! You would have
just become bald!
Shut up! I will punch you!
So bear one thing in mind!
You have lost your chance
of enticing the girl!
Now you can't show your
face to the old lady!
So you can't go in
front of the girl!
One is gone! Now only we
three will marry her!
We three will marry her?
Why? Didn't Parvati marry four men?
Parvati? Who?
Not Parvati! Kunti had married
Pandavs! - Is that so?
You people have not read Ramayan!
Illiterate! Kunti was their mother!
The girl who married Pandavs was...
- Drohi!
Draupadi! What Drohi!
- Right!
No matter who she was!
What do we care?
That was Mahabharat! This
is today's times! - Yes!
It's impossible for all three
of us to marry a girl.
Fine. You people are not willing.
So I am ready to take this
risk alone. I will marry her.
You scoundrels!
Now I can't live in this city!
What is left in this city?
It's a city of goons and loafers!
Forget night time! Somebody was
after my life in broad daylight!
What happened, grandma?
Why are you packing?
Because I want to return
to Nasik! That too alive!
But what happened? Tell me!
What all things shall I say?
Somebody should be willing to hear!
What happened, grandpa?
She saw a dream that somebody
wants to kill her!
Dream! So you mean to say
nobody had come to kill me!
Somebody must have come!
But it's not his mistake.
Anybody who sees you, he
will desire to kill you!
Many a times I too have felt so!
Oh my God! Men!
But who can dare to kill you?
Was I able to do it?
And if somebody had
come to kill you...
...would he have left you like that?
It's good that father taught me
wrestling when I was a child!
I attacked him with a dagger!
Who, grandma?
Ritu, this city is very dangerous!
Let's return!
Grandma, shall we return?
Without finding out
about brother Rahul?
Ritu... Nasik is not
far away from here!
We could stay there
and make inquires.
No! If we have to find out
about brother Rahul...
...then we will have to stay here!
If you are scared, you can leave!
Take grandpa with you too! I
don't need anybody's help!
And till the time I don't find out
everything about brother Rahul...
...I won't leave!
Ritu!
If we have to live in this house...
...then we will have to
perform veneration.
Why are you fighting with God too?
You have learnt wrestling!
You always laugh off every matter.
Really! I see evil shadows
in this house!
We will have to hold the veneration
tomorrow for Ritu!
Quickly arrange for a priest!
What are you reading?
Do you have to give
your exams tomorrow?
From tomorrow wake up early.
Today we are late.
Come on! Let's leave! Come on!
Oh God!
You begin your jogging! I will
do my light exercise. - Okay!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
There he is! There he is! Look!
That old man is pushing the car!
I think his car has broken down!
That old man is pushing
the car alone...
...when we are there!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Under the pretext of helping
him, let's flatter him!
Forget all that! Hurry up! Before
the car starts, let's go!
Yes! Come on! Come on!
Grandpa, you don't be tense! We
have come! We will help you!
Goti, you too push the car!
Where are you taking my car?
Come on!
Hey!
Goti! Run!
My car! Scoundrels!
Sir... who were they?
Is it that they have some
connection with Rahul?
Did you see anybody's face?
No! They were wearing
colourful caps!
Red! Green! Blue! I couldn't
see their faces!
Rahul was a jolly fellow! I
don't know why he did this!
Even we are amazed, sir! His
business too was running smoothly.
He didn't ever reveal
his personal matters.
But from outside we didn't
feel any tension.
Now we are tense.
Their parents had handed
them over to me.
Now I don't understand how I will
look after all this at this age!
Ritu still has 1- 1. 5 years left to
finish her post graduation! - Okay!
After that she only will look
after this office. - Yes, sir!
Till then you work as the M D.
Your new house, increments, shares...
...fix all these matters
with CEO and let me know.
Okay, sir!
- Come.
Another thing!
I won't ever come to this office
again! - Sir, your sign!
I am not capable enough to
cope with bad memories!
Henceforth send all
the work at home!
Sophie! Who is this Sophie?
I don't know! Not from the staff!
Last call was made to her!
6 calls in a day!
No! We never heard Mr.
Rahul taking her name!
Give me previous month's
mobile bills.
We will have to search for it
in the account department.
I will send it to you
as soon as I find it.
Goti! Sam! Come out!
- What happened?
The house is on fire!
Oh my!
- So what are we doing here?
Look! Look! Only smoke!
Thank God you gave us this chance!
Scoundrel! God has not
given this chance!
If I had not seen it, then we
wouldn't have got this chance!
Forget it! Now we will
go and save my gal!
And we will become the
apple of her eyes!
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on! There is a fire!
- Give it to me too!
Come on! Come on!
Hurry up!
Why is it so quiet?
Nobody is yelling!
Maybe they are still asleep!
Maybe they have choked! Don't talk!
Pour water from the pipe!
- That is what I am doing! Yes! Yes!
What are you doing here? Go
and jump in the well! - What!
Go and get the water from the well!
Go! Go! Go!
Leave! She will get burnt inside.
Come on!
Hurry up! Extinguish it!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
It's a major fire!
Then you too get inside!
Move! Move! Move! Move!
Scoundrel! Why did you hit me?
I will beat you!
There is a fire here! And you guys
are playing with the bucket!
You!
Where has Sam gone?
He must have gone inside and he
must be trying to impress her!
Betrayal! We toil and
he gets the reward!
He must be exaggerating alone!
They ruined the veneration!
Scoundrel! Who are you?
What are you doing here?
Goti! Run!
"Drum..."
"Drum..."
You go there! You go there!
You go this side!
Excuse me!
- Yes!
In whose name was this VCD given!
Can you tell me? - Yes!
Rahul Tripathi!
Oh! Close this membership!
If there are any dues,
then let me know.
Did you know Rahul?
Or any of his friend? - No!
He was state boxing champion!
There is a boxing club here!
Sterling club!
Maybe there you will
get his information!
Maybe you will find
his friend too!
Okay! Thank you!
- But you?
I am Rahul's younger sister.
Ritu Tripathi! - Okay!
Patiya! Come here!
What happened? Did you see her?
What happened? What happened?
Yes! Yes!
- Come on! Come on!
Brothers of all the
girls in the world...
... roam around in wraparound!
And her brother had to
be a boxing champion!
It's okay! Look, we have
to take some risk!
Yes! Quiet! Quiet! Tell
me! What did she say?
We have been roaming around
since past 1 /2 an hour!
Tell us! Tell us! What happened?
What did she say? Tell us! Tell us!
She said her name at the counter!
Tell me! Tell me! What's
her name? Tell me!
Ritu!
Wow! Great! Ritu Pankaj Tiwari!
What a nice match!
- It's a forceful match!
This is perfect! Ritu Gautam
Sisodia! Liked it?
It's all crap! It's all rubbish!
Look at this! Ritu Sameer Arya!
It feels as if two
incomplete names...
... have been joined
and made complete!
Rubbish! It doesn't match!
Look at this one! Ritu
Martand Damdere!
What?
Damdere!
It sounds like monkeys
jumping in a drum!
Hey! Look!
Somebody is tampering
Ritu's scooter!
Come on! Let's make air!
But that's readymade!
I mean to say let's make our
place in Ritu's heart!
Come on!
- Yes! Yes!
What are you doing?
- What is this? What is this?
You like to puncture tyres!
- You don't know me!
You cheat people and
you act smugly! You!
Why are you beating me?
Why are we beating you!
Come on! Beat him!
Leave me!
Beat him!
- Why are you beating me?
He is right! He is right!
Don't beat him now! Let Ritu come!
Then we will bash him!
Yes! - She should also know how
much we are toiling for her!
Yes! Right!
- Am I right?
You go! Go and check whether
she is coming! - Yes!
Look!
Yes! She is coming!
Start beating him!
Start! Start!
I will thrash you!
You!
Come on! Come on! Beat him!
You puncture beautiful
girls' tyre! Beat him!
You puncture beautiful girls' tyre!
Look!
This is not the one!
Goti! Run!
That old man has come! Now
I will go and entice him!
Hang on! Stop! First tell us
what your plan is! - Yes!
I will go there!
- Then?
And then I will deliberately
dash with the old man!
Then I will turn around and
say are you Rahul's grandpa?
If this trick doesn't work then
you can shorten my height!
How much more will you shrink?
And be careful! Our luck
is bad in Ritu's matter!
That's because all of
your ideas were bad!
Lotus won't blossom in filth!
Just watch! How I execute
my plan and come!
Look! He has come! He has come!
Quickly go!
From where are you going?
Are you blind? Can't you see?
I will just pick it up!
- You will pick it up?
What is all this?
Dear, listen to me!
How dare you touch my wife!
- Listen to me!
Help Maru! Quickly!
Having fun! Act more smugly!
Now you are in trouble!
Yes! You were exaggerating
so much! Now pay the price!
We shouldn't even touch him!
Let him be like this!
We will do this! We will do that!
Now you are in trouble!
Remove it! Remove it!
Is it a child's play to
befriend the old man?
He has shed his blood! And you
guys are letting it go waste!
You don't worry. Your
blood won't go waste!
Red vermilion! This is a good
omen that she will be yours.
Then stab a few more
pieces in my stomach.
I am ready to endure all of it!
You were blinded by the chili.
- Yes!
You got burned in the fire! And
glass pieces injured you. - Yes.
Meaning 3 are out. Now
there is only one way.
What?
- What?
I think...
- What?
Tell me.
I think...
- What?
You people forget her!
- What?
Yes!
- Is that so?
Forget her!
Grandpa!
Oh my God! What happened?
Are you fine, grandpa?
How did this happen?
A guy deliberately pushed me and
I fell flat on the ground.
There was a gang with him!
They were beating me like an egg!
- Who were they?
Who else? Must be those scoundrels!
When I told you, you teased
me saying it's my dream!
Now when they have thrashed
you, you believe me!
I tell you! Write a report
at the police station!
Do one thing! Go inside!
Sit comfortably!
And give me a description
of that guy!
Description of that guy!
He was not a guy!
He was a scoundrel!
Get a glass of water!
- Okay!
His face was so ugly. That I have
never seen it in my dreams.
And his height... to see his face...
...even a puny guy will have to bend!
Eyes like crocodile! Sticky hair!
Whether he had a nose
or a trampled tomato...
...I don't remember.
But when he shows his teeth,
then even the most...
...foolish guy will look smart!
What are you thinking, inspector?
It's so strange! I too have been
searching for such a guy!
I will start searching for that guy.
I will let you know when I nab him.
Till then you stay alert!
Excuse me!
- Yes, ma'am!
Can you help me?
- Tell me!
This is Airtel's disconnected
number... of some Sophie.
If I can get her address
from your office...
I am very sorry, ma'am!
We can't give our customers'
personal information at any cost.
It is against the company's policy.
I understand. But... I want
to talk to you in private.
Can you please come out?
- Okay!
Come on! Come on!
Return! Return!
- Where? What happened?
She already has a boyfriend!
If she has a boyfriend,
then we stand no chance!
How do you know?
Can't you see how they are talking!
Look! Look! Look!
Look! How she is talking!
Return! Return!
You leave! He can't be
her boyfriend! - Yes!
She has come to this city
just 2 days ago! - Yes!
How will she find a boyfriend
in 2 days! - Yes!
Let's go and ask! We will find
out whether it's true or not!
Come on!
- Come on!
Stop! Stop! Hey!
Stop!
Seeing my sister, you
were feeling tempted!
What was going on?
- What sister?
So he doesn't even know this!
Shall I punch you?
Hang on, boss! Look, I don't
understand what you guys are saying!
I will explain who he is!
The girl with whom you
were talking sweetly...
... he is her brother!
Brother?
- Yes!
That dead brother?
- When did you die?
Her brother!
Look, I don't know
who died and when!
The girl told me that her brother
has committed suicide!
So who are you people?
I too am her brother.
But I am not dead!
And I am her future husband!
- We will decide that later!
Bear this in mind! Forget my sister!
Hello! I didn't go
after your sister!
She herself had come
pleading with me!
She was asking about her
brother's friends.
And she wanted some details
of some Sophie!
What else was she asking?
She is your sister! Go and ask her!
Why are you bullying me?
Fools!
Now I understood where
she is headed!
Where?
- Where?
The girl wants information about
her late brother's friends.
So?
So come on! We too will follow
the 'Qatar' ( series )!
Qatar is in Saudi! Do
you have a passport!
Get him a one way ticket!
So that he never returns!
I don't have a passport!
"Say that you are my Sonia."
Greetings! We are Rahul's friends.
We did boxing together
in Sterling club.
We were best friends.
- So?
Our club is publishing a
magazine this year too.
So we need Rahul's photo.
For memories column.
Please sit down. Let me check.
Read! What is written!
This is not my photo!
What is written? Is my name written?
Everybody's name is published! Look!
Deeply mourned by friends. Pankaj!
Markand! Sameer! Gautam!
Markand is your name?
- Yes!
You are there! And his address
is given! - Why?
Do you have a house?
- Come on!
Come on!
Asking why! Come on!
Do you remember what we told you?
Yes! I will start reciting
when I get the chance!
Recite it like a parrot!
- Yes!
Don't add anything! Just say
what we have taught you!
If you said too much, I
will forget everything!
Our lives lie in your hand!
If you made any mistake,
I will bash you!
She is coming! She is coming!
She is coming!
Hurry up! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Close the door! Close the door!
Run! Run! Run! Run!
Do as we said!
- Okay!
Come! Whom do you want to meet?
Is this Pankaj, Markand, Sameer
and Gautam's house?
Yes! Yes! Come in! Come in!
Who is he?
This is my masters' best
and closest friend.
I want to meet him!
- Impossible! He is dead!
Not him. I want to
meet your masters.
Let me recite what I have memorised.
After master's death, all four of
them have gone into depression.
They have even closed
the swimming pool.
They sit in front of the photo and...
...they weep inconsolably
like Gandhi.
They bang their heads!
He is overacting! He will ruin it!
I had told you! He won't be
right! He will ruin it!
But he said he will do it! Now look!
You!
Don't fight!
Don't fight!
I want to meet your masters!
But they are not here! They
all have gone for boxing!
Where?
- Sterling club!
Okay! I will go and meet
them there! - Okay!
Come on! Come on!
Now we have to reach
the club before her!
Will you give me something?
Yes! A lot! After we
return from the club!
You just massage your body with
oil! We will be back soon!
Okay! Okay!
Let's start boxing!
Otherwise when she will come...
...she will find us standing idle!
Remove the clothes!
Hey! We will feign boxing!
You all crazy fellows
are not trustworthy!
You guys will really break my bones!
Hey, Maru! Got it?
Get lost! Coward! People lay
down their lives in love!
You can't even endure
a few punches! Coward!
Lovers are never afraid! Didn't
ever hear this song?
But why this wild game of animals?
Let's play some other game!
You play hide and seek!
Ritu's brother was
a boxing champion!
If we are feigning
to be his friends...
...then we too should know boxing!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
We will have fun! We will have fun!
- Hurry up!
Hey!
Beat! Beat!
My turn!
You scoundrel!
Get up! Get up!
She has come! She has come!
Beat him quickly!
Beat him! Beat him!
Yeah!
Come!
Maybe they are the ones!
- I see!
They are those guys!
Her grandparents too have come!
Hide your face! The old people
have seen us before!
Yeah!
Hit slowly! Hit slowly!
Scoundrel! Don't be mad!
I won't spare you later!
Come on! Get up! Get up!
Excuse me!
Yes! Yes!
Gautam! Markand! Sameer!
- I am Pankaj! Pankaj!
The rest?
- I have sent all three of them!
Where?
- To your father's wedding!
Do you know Rahul?
- That boxing champion Rahul?
Yes! I am his sister!
- Ritu!
I have seen, heard so much
about you. Seeing you...
They are completely defeated!
Why don't they get up?
They are dead for sometime!
They will regain their lives
after you will leave!
They take so much time!
You alone beat these three
hale and hearty people?
Today just 3 were enough!
Let's go there and talk!
Come! Please!
- Come on!
Did brother Rahul have a
quarrel with somebody?
Or did he have any enemy?
No! Why?
Otherwise suddenly why
will he commit suicide?
I think it's somebody's conspiracy!
First they killed Rahul. And
now they are after us. Look!
That scoundrel gang attacked me!
And somebody had come
to attack her too!
Yes! But I... I thrashed him!
And somebody even tried to pour
water on the veneration fire!
Who are these scoundrels? They
have made our lives miserable!
And why?
Must be some dangerous dacoits
or some crazy robbers!
Do you remember their faces?
It's imprinted in my mind!
Even in my sleep I
can recognise them!
I needed some other information
about brother Rahul!
Well, right now I am tired! So...
So tomorrow? What about tomorrow?
Fine! Sure! Why not?
Take our card!
- Okay!
Our address is written on this!
And whenever you are free...
- Okay.
Come for tea. We will sit and talk.
- Fine! Sure!
Greetings!
- Greetings! God bless you!
Yeah! Yeah!
You are dancing after beating us!
Stop!
I didn't say anything! They
said it! So what can I do?
Why did you beat us so badly?
Stop! They have seen your faces!
So what can I do?
Goti...
Yes! But Ritu didn't see us!
We all can meet her!
Yes! Tomorrow you will
not meet Ritu alone!
We all will come!
And you will tell her that we
are Rahul's real friends.
And through us, you befriended him!
And we will fix the time
of meeting and the place!
What are you thinking?
- Yes!
Okay!
Sir... jail, dance bar, huts,
we searched every place.
But we didn't find Maru anywhere!
Don't feel bad! You believed him.
But it was too late.
Why are you digging at my wounds?
Forget Maru! What about
Pakiya's brother-in-law?
Since when their house is locked!
I inquired at the neighbourhood.
But nobody has their new address!
You! Now I will post you
at some new areas.
Till then you will search for them
like a hunting dog! Got it?
The interest amount will increase.
And I have all the jewelleries safe
in the locker. No need to worry.
My position is safe.
It's been half an hour.
- I told you!
She knows this place. She is
not an illiterate like you!
She is an educated girl. We
told her 10 : 30. Now it's 10.
Listen, you will introduce us in
such a way that immediately...
...she should come to know
how close we were to Rahul.
And that we introduced you to him.
Fine! Fine! I will tell her!
Why are you standing? Sit!
Move! The dress will get creased!
How do I look?
- Shahrukh! Shahrukh!
If you covered your face with a
pot, you will look like Shahrukh!
Shall I try on you?
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!
Call Ritu and tell her to come
to Corianthan swimming pool.
There is a coffee shop there too.
Yes. But I don't have my cell.
Otherwise I would have called her.
Don't lie! I can see your cell!
Take out your cell!
It's there! It's there!
Fine! I am taking it out! Wait!
- Here!
It's busy!
It's ringing! Talk to her!
Ritu, this is Pakiya speaking!
Pankaj speaking!
Ritu, can we meet at Corianthan
swimming pool...
... instead of the mall?
No! I will tell you! I will
meet you and tell you!
Okay!
Hurry up! Hurry up!
We have to reach there before her!
I am starting the bike!
- Start the bike! Hurry up!
What hurry is this? I
too want to meet Ritu!
What are you doing?
- Shut up!
It's not starting!
You get it repaired!
I am going with them!
Stop! Take me too!
Ritu, this is Pakiya speaking!
Pankaj speaking!
Ritu, there is a slight
change of plan!
Don't go to Corianthan club! Yes!
Instead near our house,
near your house...
...there is Nehru road.
Do you know? Very good! Very good!
India coffee house besides
it, do you know?
Very good! Very good!
So we will meet there.
I will tell you when
we meet! Okay! Okay!
My perfume too has dried up!
I am tired of waiting for Pakiya!
I think something is fishy!
Yes! Ritu too has still not come!
Both of them together,
it means danger!
Before they start romancing,
let's go and find them!
Why did you change the place
of meeting suddenly?
No! As such that place was nice!
But suddenly some hooligans
started hovering there!
Tell me! What will you have?
You tell me!
- Cold coffee.
One cold coffee with ice-cream.
And a glass of water.
Have something.
- No! I am fasting today! Thank you!
Fasting? Why?
Men like us believe that
if we fast on Thursdays...
...then we will find a nice bride.
I see!
Look! He is that same scoundrel...
...who bashed me that day!
What happened?
Let's leave!
- Why?
This place is not right!
But just now you said that
this is a classic place.
Hot... it's so hot and this weather
is not good for your complexion.
Let's leave!
But the cold coffee we ordered...
No! Cancel the coffee!
You got scared on seeing me?
- You...
Why? You bash people who
fill air in the tyre!
Who are you? I don't know you!
But I know you very well!
- Me? How?
Where are the rest
of the scoundrels?
Who? Whom are you talking
about? Mister!
Seeing his face I think he
has fooled us many times!
Look! Look! Ritu is here!
But why is it so crowded? Pakiya!
Who is bashing him?
Messiahs! He cheated us!
But this is that bike gang!
Let's go and save him!
Saint! You stay here! We don't
often get justice in this world!
Let him receive some punishment!
He is right! You are great!
What are you doing? Break his teeth!
As it is he talks rubbish!
Idiots! Don't you all eat?
Punch him in the stomach!
Enough! Now let's save him!
If he died then who will
introduce us to Ritu?
Yes! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Beat him!
Take this! Take this!
Take this! Take this!
Where are you running?
Come on!
I will not spare you!
I will not spare you!
Where are you all running away?
What is going on? Is there
a dance performance?
Get lost! Go to your houses!
Nothing is going on!
Are you okay?
- I am all right! I am fine!
You were a big boxing champion!
Still you couldn't fight
those weaklings! Useless!
What happened is that they
suddenly from the back...
Hey! Do people inform
before attacking?
Then what! I taught you
all tactics of karate!
Still you got defeated!
Because you were not
paying attention...
...when I taught you those tactics!
That's why he made a mistake!
Don't act to be a hero using me!
Are you Ritu?
- Yes!
Great!
Good that you people arrived!
Otherwise who would
have saved us today!
Fooling us you came here!
Introduce us!
Sorry! I forgot to introduce
you to them!
They are my friends... and
Rahul's friends too.
Oh!
He is Goti!
Hi! I am Gautam!
- Hi!
Sameer!
- Hi!
And I am Markand!
- Hi!
Good that I found you all!
I wanted some information
about brother Rahul!
So listen... Rahul loved a girl
a lot. She too loved him a lot.
Or was she playing a charade
of love, I don't know.
One day she refused to meet Rahul.
- But why?
Because... later on we found
out that the girl's family...
...was dominating her.
But Rahul felt so bad that
liquor, cigarette...
He gave up everything!
What was the girl's name?
I remember! Yes... Sophie!
- It means she was a Catholic!
Yes! That was the root
cause of the problem!
This Hindu and Catholic matter!
Sophie's family tried so
hard to separate them!
Many times they hired goons
to beat him! - Yes!
Yes! The guys from whom I save him...
...they were those goons!
They are still after us!
But we too supported Rahul!
We never forsake him.
If Rahul had just said once,
then I would have abducted...
...that girl from the wedding dais
and thrown her in front of him!
But he didn't tell me!
I remember the last time we met
him. He looked like Devdas.
He embraced us and said goodbye.
Seeing his tears, I
too started crying.
Don't cry! Don't cry!
Come with me! He is like this only!
Don't cry! Come with me!
Come with me! Don't cry!
Don't cry! Don't cry!
Don't overact! You
will ruin the game!
Yeah! Yes!
Congratulations to me
for the wedding!
Congratulations to you
for your sister-in-law!
You scoundrel! Don't talk rubbish.
'Thank you for telling the
truth about brothers...
... last days. With these
broken links...
... my life would have
been scattered too. '
'You brought it together. '
'You had befriended brother...
... now you will have
to befriend me too. '
"The showered sky."
"The tormenting heart"
"On the lonely paths, what
is it looking for?"
"There is only fog, amongst us."
"On the lonely paths, what
is it looking for?"
"In love, the heart
has started singing"
"The love is become enjoying."
"When the time stops."
"My heart says."
"As if my love says."
"I am like the time."
"The two hearts live like."
"Like relief stays in the heart."
"To touch the bright stars."
"To touch the quiet shores."
"To touch the silent mountains."

Look, I am telling you...
...I have done the booking
for the seat next to Ritu.
Okay, but I have booked the
other seat next to her.
No one can do anything booking.
Ritu has booked the tickets...
...you will sit according to
the tickets that you get.
Right, right, absolutely right.
My Ritu's call, my Ritu's call.
Hello, where are you?
If you have changed the bathroom
for taking a bath...
...then you should have told me!
For you.
- Give me. Hello, Markand.
Maru, you scoundrel!
The number you have dialled
is not valid...
... please call after sometime.
Not valid, call after sometime...
Maru, Maru I will take
care of you later...
... Chaudhary, bring the
short guys gold!
Tell me today's rate, and give
me the price accordingly.
They dare to fool me,
the scoundrels.
I will not spare them.
Why are you taking so much time...
...quickly tell me, how
much money will I get.
At least 3 years.
- What?
Take a seat, we will count
the money and give you.
Slowpokes, hurry up.
Put him behind bars.
- bars, what have I done?
Look at his courage, he wanted
to sell fake jewels to me.
Fake, fake...
- Your acting is real.
Come on. - Don't touch me,
I am a police official too.
What were you thinking?
I was thinking that, other
than you 4, brother Rahul...
... had another friend, who
was very close to Rahul.
Where could he be?
He won't be anywhere, because
there was no one else.
Because we are all friends
that Rahul had. - Yes.
No, there was someone else too.
I have only heard about him,
but never seen him.
But I hate him a lot.
What did you say the name was?
- Jai.
Brother Rahul used to
call him by that name.
I don't know how he looks.
But... why do you hate him.
That's personal.
Okay, what if I know him and
introduce you to him...
...then what will you do?
I will give him a tight slap.
Do you want to know, who Jai is?
Yes, who.
He is one of us, but he is not
present right now. - What?
Pakiya. - Yes Pakiya for us,
but many call him Jai.
His name is Jaiwardhan, so Jai
- Jawardhan...
Please, please it is not
such a big secret...
... but please don't tell him,
that we have told you this.
He doesn't like this name so much.
But...
- But we are your friends too...
...the friend that helps
you in troubled times...
...are your best friend, isn't it.
One is gone forever.
Thank you God.
The credit for getting rid
of Pakiya goes to my brain.
Your complete name is Pankaj
Jaywardhane, isn't it?
But... - And Pakiya for
your friends, right.
But... - But my brother
used to call you Jai.
You don't need to be so shocked,
I know everything
Actually I had come here
to give you a tight slap.
But I will not do that.
I will not raise my hand on you...
... because you are my future husband.
It was so much fun.
He wanted to get rid of us.
Now Ritu will take care of him.
I had told you, not just my hair...
...I have a big brain too.
He is a big scoundrel!
Yes boys.
From today you are all
my best friends...
...you introduced me to the
one I was dying to meet.
He is my fiance.
Fiance. - You had said that
you will slap him, kill him...
...and many more thing,
what are you doing?
You are right, I should do that...
... he kept hiding from
me for so many days...
... he should be punished. Isn't it?
But what can I do, whenever
I see him, my heart melts.
And you, kept teasing
me along with them.
Maru, I am losing balance.
- What?
Ritu, you should leave now...
...you have to take grandfather
to the doctor.
Oh yeah, yeah. Bye.
Bye, I will see you tomorrow.
- Bye.
This was all that was left to see.
Useless, you were creating
obstructions in my path...
... now that obstruction
is in your paths.
Whom did Ritu's brother chose
for Ritu, his best friend.
What was the name of
that friend, Jai!
How did I become Jai, because
of your ill-fates!
Now tomorrow I will go and
meet grandma and grandpa...
...and then engagement and day
after tomorrow, marriage.
I will surely arrange a feast
for you poor people.
By the way Goti, tell
me whose idea was it.
What if the real Jai appears?
Till then I will fill Ritu's
heart with so much love...
...that no one will be
able to separate us
I had a great desire to meet you...
... now that I have embraced
you, I am happy.
Where are your parents,
and rest of your family?
I don't have anyone, just a sister.
Where is she?
- She is not there.
I mean she is, but not here.
No matter son, no matter.
Rahul had told us everything
about Jai...
...still you will keep inquiring.
Son.
- Yes grandpa.
We had heard a lot about you,
but never saw you.
Today I have seen you too.
We would have met earlier...
... if you would have come home
in Diwali with Rahul.
But you suddenly changed the plan...
...that's why we couldn't meet.
And after Rahul's demise,
everything changed.
Let it be, stop remembering
the past...
...and think what we
have to do ahead.
I have thought about it, we will
do what Rahul had decided.
After a year, as soon as
Ritu's studies are over...
...we will get them married.
And one more thing, now
you are not a stranger...
...you are our kin. And
the our business...
...which was an orphan till now,
now you will take care of it.
I don't know...
Stop blabbering, the entire
office is scattered...
...join the office from tomorrow
and progress it.
I don't know anything
about the business.
Don't worry about that...
... manager will explain
you everything.
Yes, but I have my own business so...
But your business was ruined.
Rahul had told us.
Yes, but that was then but now...
Stop this now and then.
Go to the office everyday
until marriage...
...take 1 lakh rupees salary.
- 1 Lakh.
Why, is it less?
Look son, now you are
a part of this family...
...and I am the head of the family.
So now tolerate his hooliganism.
I will just call up office.
M D, tomorrow morning Ritu's fiance
will reach the office...
... now he will take care
of the entire business...
...appoint him in place of the owner.
And ask him all sorts of
questions and not me.
Yes.
Careful son.
What are you doing son?
Keep coming son...
... now this
is your house too.
Sorry.
Jain sir, why did
you come yourself...
...you could have sent someone.
- He is a nice boy.
Sir, you have the biggest
account in the bank.
And you have stopped going
to the office too...
...that's why I thought
of coming myself...
...and taking the signatures. Here
I will sign it and have it sent.
- Yes sir.
Gangadhar.
- Yes sir.
Come here.
The boy that just left, who was he?
I have heard that he is
their future son-in-law.
Son-in-law!
Do you all have short term memories?
Don't you remember what
we had decided...
... before entrapping the girl.
When the girl falls for one of us...
...then the other three will leave.
Now that Ritu has chosen
me, what's my fault?
You all are jealous.
Ritu's love is not love,
but a misconception.
As soon as the misconception
is cleared...
...they will not spare you.
When they will find out,
that you are flat broke...
...they will make you wear
clothes without pockets.
They will put you behind bars,
he doesn't understand.
There is no question
of Ritu finding out.
But you won't be able
to see my happiness...
...you will find peace only
after provoking her.
But I will not let that happen.
Before you tell Ritu everything,
I will tell Ritu the truth...
...everything will be cleared,
we will see what happens.
After that, we won't
have any relation.
Our friendship is over.
Goodbye.
She has come, the witch has
come to ask for the rent.
Does she eat notes for food?
I say, let us leave this room.
Shall I book a room
for you in a 5 star?
Go and tell her we are dead.
- Okay.
Greetings, did you recognise me.
I am bank manager Srinivas Jain...
...I had gone to your home, so
your servant... sorry, helper...
...told me that you are here.
So I came here.
Excuse me, but waiting another
second was difficult for me.
I am sorry, who are you,
what you are...
...without knowing that, I rejected
your loan application.
You wanted a loan, didn't you?
I am prepared to give you
as much loan as you want...
...just tell me once, that you
have forgiven me. Please.
Will we get the loan?
- Yes.
You had asked for 4,
I will give you 8...
...and that too, without
any guarantor.
What has happened to him?
- Has he gone crazy?
These flowers, and there
are sweets too...
... made in real ghee.
Congratulations, congratulations...
...from tomorrow you are the
mentor of Tripathi garments...
...your account, is the biggest
account of our bank.
I am a fool, please don't punish
my bank for my mistake...
... please don't close your account.
Come, come, come.
- Come sir.
Take a seat sir.
Come here.
Tell me, why was that manager
apologising to you?
He had seen me at his house.
- I thought so.
Look brother, your life is made...
... now help us progress our life too.
If we get this loan, then all
our problems will be solved.
Look, I am not going
to get in this mess...
...I am not going to
lie to Ritu anymore.
Even we don't want to
deceive her anymore...
We will take a dip in the Ganges
and was away our sins.
No, no I can't lie to Ritu anymore.
Why, was your father's
name Harishchandra?
Leave him.You say it...
...tell her the truth,
but after a few days.
If we don't give the money, then
uncle will skin me alive.
How long will I have to lie?
Until we get the money?
When will we get the money?
Let us go and ask him.
- Yes, come on.
Sir, when will we get the money?
Just come to the ban tomorrow...
...fill up the form and sign
it, and in 2 weeks...
...the money will be in your hand.
Both of us will come.
What time will we have to come?
As soon as the bank opens,
come at 10 o'clock.
Okay.
But he still didn't forgive me
He has a very bog heart uncle...
...we forgave you immediately.
We will come tomorrow. Bye.
You come here!
Which scoundrel touched my brother!
Bhai, they didn't come today.
When they come, give
them this number.
Ask them to ready their shroud.
Send it to their homes, or cover
them after they are dead.
Come on brother.
Sir, have you met our new M D.
No I haven't met Mr. Jai,
I have only heard his name.
He had said at 10 o' clock,
he must be on his way.
Rahul sir, had fixed Ritu's
marriage with this boy, Jai.
Here are you 100 rupees.
Don't get down, don't get down.
- What happened?
Take the car ahead.
This way, this way.
Come on.
- What happened?
Come on.
- What happened?
That fair man that was
standing there...
... he is my brother-in-law. yes.
Now if I go to the office,
we will lose that loan...
...and if I don't go to the office,
we will lose that loan.
So what should we do now?
Listen, from today you
are Jai in the office...
...and I will Jai at home.
Do you want the loan or not?
I don't know anything
about the office.
Nothing, okay, bye-bye, thank
you, get me a coffee...
...you do know that much,
keep saying that.
But I don't know to read and write.
I will see it, I will see it say
that and bring the papers home...
...and I will sign it.
There is nothing to it.
What if Ritu calls up?
If Ritu calls up, then ask
her to call on the mobile.
Come on, take off the pant
I will take off the shirt.
Come on, don't talk, don't talk.
Seems like he is our sir.
Him.
- Yes.
Who knows what kind of a boss is he?
Mr. Jai.
- Yes.
Welcome sir.
Hello.
Yeah, yeah one sec, once sec.
Sophie.
"It is soothing, and sweet
what kind of a pain is it?"
"It has awakened a bit, for you."
"Your style is enchanting,
your sight is magical."
"How did you do this, tell me that."
"You took my heart."
"You took my heart."
"You took my heart."
"You took my heart away."
"You took my heart."
"You took my heart."
"You took my heart."
"You took my heart away."
I want to talk to you.
You. - I am Ritu Tripathi,
Rahul's sister.
Who Rahul? - Rahul, whom
you used to love a lot.
Good morning sir.
Sir, this is our consignment
invoice...
...for export to UK.
Talk in Hindi, can't
you talk in Hindi.
No I mean, the clothes
that we export to UK...
...so this is for that,
so you have to sign it.
Yes, here.
Here.
Okay, keep it here and go.
First I will take the file home and
then read it and then sign it.
It is very urgent.
Then do it yourself.
- I cannot sign it sir.
If you can't sign it, then why
do you wear such a big tie...
...and take such a fat salary?
No, I mean I don't have
the authority to sign it.
You will have to do it.
I am busy today and I
have a meeting too...
...I can't sign it today.
Why?
- Because today is Wednesday...
...and on a Wednesday I don't
touch pen and paper.
Wednesday... - Don't think
so much, go from here, go.
Wednesday...
- Go. - Yes sir.
Where has he got me entrapped?
Come, come. Go!
- No, nothing sir.
Sir, has the sign been done?
Where did Mr. Tripathi
find this sample from...
...and that too for Ritu.
He is half fool and half stupid,
completely insane.
Since he has come, always
asks the peon...
...to bring something to eat.
He keeps eating entire day. - Really.
It is said, when God is grateful
weakling becomes mighty.
Then what is difference between
an elephant and a peacock.
All are respected.
Where did you bring this from?
From Pande the betel leaf seller.
Ask Pande to stop
making betel leaf...
...and start polishing shoes.
Betel leaf and honesty should
always be tested.
Then dip the finger in limestone...
...and spread it on the
betel leaf, like...
... it is the cheek of a girl.
And then some special chutney
tobacco essence, catechu.
And the real catechu.
And then...
Even the dead will rise.
Tell him, if he doesn't know
how to make betel leaf...
...then I will teach him
to make betel leaf.
Who told you all this nonsense?
Close friends of brother Rahul.
There is truth in what
you said Ritu...
...I had fallen in love and was
also about to get married...
... but with Jai, and not Rahul.
Jai, brother Rahul's close
friend Jai. - Yes.
You are lying? - Ritu, why do
you feel that I am lying?
Because I and Jai were
about to get married...
... brother Rahul had arranged it.
I know, because he didn't
know that Jai loved me.
So Jai loves you.
- Of course.
If he loves you, then why
didn't he marry you?
If he would have been alive,
then he surely would have.
Jai is alive, he is
absolutely alive.
No Ritu. - Will you talk to him,
your lies will be uncovered.
What happened?
I cannot get through.
Come with me.
Sir, Ritu Madam.
If it is a call for her,
then give it to her.
No, no Ritu madam wants
to talk to you.
Ask her to call on my mobile.
She cannot get through
to your mobile...
...that's why she called
on my mobile.
Then ask her to bang the
mobile on the floor...
...either it will hit
the mobile or madam.
Did you have an argument with her?
It is not your job to ask that.
No, she wants to talk to
you it is very urgent.
Look, I can't talk to her can't
you see how busy I am.
Hello, he is busy drinking juice.
She says it is urgent.
Go from here, can't I
even breathe freely.
She is coming to meet
you in the office.
Move! Move! Move!
Where are you going?
What will I say when she arrives?
Ask her to jump in the well.
Something is wrong.
Where is Jai sir?
He just ran away.
- What?
Yes, as soon as I told him
that you are coming...
... he ran away like a ghost from God.
I cannot understand anything.
I told you, he can't be Jai.
He is a fraud.
But how can you be so sure?
Because this is my story.
Jai and I grew up together
in the orphanage.
After 18 years of age, we
came out of the orphanage...
... but Jai never dwelled
in the same place.
Where did he go, what
he did I didn't know.
He used to come to
meet me sometimes...
... but always used to send me gifts.
And calls, it never stopped.
One day he brought
me here and said...
From today this house is yours.
Wow, and you.
- I am yours since childhood.
Only to say, neither do you
stay with me or marry me.
Where do you keep running
away from me?
It is a matter of a few days.
A last work is pending of Zikomo.
Zikomo, Zikomo, Zikomo,
who is this Zikomo?
Zikomo is my boss, I will
ask him to release me...
...from his clutches so that
I can come in your custody.
Till then you can live
here comfortably...
...and shop lavishly for marriage.
- And you?
Here is the kitchen.
I will come after a
few days, till then...
...don't tell anyone anything.
Our marriage, about this house,
nothing. - Why?
How, when, where there are
a lot of questions...
...and very little time.
Believe me, whatever I am doing
it is for our betterment.
In our childhood, we faced
many hardships Sophie...
... but now, I want to fill
our life with happiness.
Just a bit wait.
But the wait was very long.
When he finished the last
work for Zikomo...
...and came here from Mumbai...
... he had stopped at
your brothers house.
Rahul, where did you
keep my luggage?
In the room upstairs, from
today that room is yours.
I can't believe it you wound up
your entire business in Mumbai.
The goons of Mumbai
were out to kill me...
...there was no other way.
I am a simple man I couldn't
lock horns with them.
Home, property, office I
have sold everything...
...and have come here.
Now I don't even want to
hear the name of Mumbai.
What will you do now,
have you thought?
I have thought, that's what I
have come to discuss with you.
There is nothing to
discuss with me...
...start working with me, understood.
But it is your family
business, isn't it?
Yes so, I have already made
you a part of my family...
...then what is your objection
in joining my family business.
I didn't understand.
Listen, Ritu is my doll,
my life you know that.
After mummy papa passed away...
...I have taken care of her as
a daughter and not a sister.
That's why whenever I think
about her marriage...
...I can't think of trusting
a stranger.
That's why I have decided,
a kin is better...
...than a stranger for my Ritu.
Very nice, who is that man?
You.
- Me.
Yes, I remember I was new in
the city, we were strangers...
...you helped me, made
me your friend...
...since then I have been thinking...
...I need such a man for my sister...
...who has so much love in his heart.
Don't be so hasty.
You keep quiet, for
the past 6 months...
...I have been telling
Ritu about you.
I know she is restless to meet you.
Day after tomorrow is Diwali,
and you are coming...
... home with me, even grandfather
knows that.
Who knows what grandma
would have brought...
...from the supermarket
to make for you.
Why didn't you ask me before
taking such a big decision?
Because I have the right.
When it concerns my sister and you...
...then I have the right.
You both are very dear to me...
...whom I can whenever,
however... use.
Look, take a bath quickly,
breakfast is getting cold.
Jai.
Look, who has come. Rahul.
- Hi.
Jai, this is my love,
my life Sophie.
Good that you have
brought him along...
Come on, come in food id ready.
Angry.
You call me your best friend,
...and also keep such a
big secret. Why man?
My life is a secret too, but now I
want to tell you everything clearly.
You should have told me
everything earlier...
...atleast I wouldn't have seen
so many dreams for Ritu.
There is still nothing wrong,
you go to your village...
...for Diwali, and tell Ritu that
Jai is a bit busy in his work...
... until then we will find
a boy much better then me.
Now please forgive me and come in...
...otherwise Sophie will come
after me with the cutlery.
Now come on, come on.
Are you Rahul Tripathi?
- Yes, why what happened?
Do you recognise these things?
Yes, my friend Jai had
a watch like this.
Jai?
- Jaishankar Yadav, my friend. Why?
We found a body from the
Panchganga river...
...your card was in his pocket.
You will have to come with
us for identification.
The police couldn't understand
whether it was a suicide or...
There was no reason to do so, but...
I am trying, as soon as I find out
anything I will let you know.
Control yourself.
Sophie, please.
I had some of his belonging with me.
Since then I have opened the
lock of this house today.
After that, neither did Rahul
call me or come to meet me.
I got the news that,
two close friends...
...were close after death too.
Then why are those boys lying to me?
Hi Jai.
- You.
Sophie, don't you know me?
You are feeling shy, aren't you?
Must be sweat.
Let us talk, take a seat.
Tell me, who are you?
You do know Rahul, isn't it?
Your close friend Rahul.
I was about to marry Rahul,
but I deceived him...
...so he committed suicide.
Did you remember anything?
We are done for.
What are you doing, we don't
any soap or tea leaf...
...get out of her, come on get out.
Ritu... the truth...
I have heard enough of your truth.
Ritu, we were about to...
- Shut up, don't take my name.
Your voices hurt me.
I am ashamed of your
names and your faces.
It is not that you lied to me...
... but how did I believe
you hooligans?
Like a fool, I got entrapped
in your trap.
I never saw bigger cheaters than
you in life, like my friends here!
You should have been ashamed...
...for doing such a big fraud!
You are worse then the
worms in the gutter!
Even drunkards lying
in the dustbin...
... have better self conscience
then you!
Don't even thing that
I will forgive you!
Ritu, we were...
I will hit you if you say anything.
Now whatever you want to say...
...say it in the police station.
I will not spare you!
My name is Zikomo.
Inspector Zikomo.
So soon. She left just now.
I want some information from you.
Look inspector,
we are telling the truth...
Telling the truth
is better for you...
... but not here, in the police
station. Come on.
This is not the police station,
it is a dump.
Why have you brought us here?
This is my police station,
and this is my court.
Whatever I want, that will happen.
Who are you?
Asking questions is my question...
...and answering it is yours.
The question is that, do you
know Jaishankar Yadav?
Yes.
What do you know about him?
What do you mean?
I want to know only one thing?
What?
Where is the drum?
Drum?
Drum, what drum? Which drum?
I want my drum!
Are you a drummer?
We don't know any drum
or anything else.
Don't trouble us unnecessarily.
What are you doing?
Tell me!
Let me down please, I
don't know anything...
...I swear on Lord Maruti
I don't know anything.
Let me down, I feel like vomiting...
... leave us, we didn't see anything.
Leave me, my head is spinning...
...I didn't see the drum, I swear!
Is there anyone hearing us,
leave us, let us down!
I beg of you, let me down!
Let us give the drum to him.
Give it to him, how
will we give him.
There must be some marriage
or a mourning...
...we will take it from there
and give it to him. - Yes.
Where is Maru?
Maru.
- Maru.
Where is Maru? Maru.
Say something is he alive
or did you kill him!
Show them a sample, what we
did with that fool. - Maru.
Why are you freeing him?
Free us too. We want to see too.
Leave him!
- Pakiya!
Get him out. - Get him out. -
He doesn't know how to swim.
Get him out.
- Get him out.
Get him out.
- Get him out. - Leave him!
Leave him!
He will die!
I will tell you where the drum
is, I know everything...
... but first get him out.
If anything happens to him, then
we won't open our mouth...
...even if you kill us!
Then you will never get the drum.
Hey.
Pakiya.
- Pakiya.
Open us.
Pakiya. Open us.
Pakiya! Pakiya.
- Pakiya, are you fine? Pakiya.
Now tell me where the drum is?
First bring Maru?
I spared one, isn't that enough?
Either you tell me
where the drum is...
...or forget Maru forever.
If you want the drum, then you
will have to call Maru...
... because I have giving
the drum to Maru.
That fool knows where the drum is.
Bring him.
Maru, what have they done to him.
Maru.
What happened?
They forced something in my mouth...
...after that, then scraped
the throat...
...and then pulled it
out from the nose.
After that I lost conscience.
What will happen now?
What will happen now?
Now we have to get out of here.
Let us give the drum to him.
Whom, what? What?
The drum, remember I gave
it to you. - When?
Why are you winking at me?
There is dirt in the eye,
stop acting...
...we can die, quickly tell
me where is the drum.
Either I have gone mad,
or you have gone insane.
Will you give it or not?
Will you give the drum or not?
I will give you, I will
give you a tight slap.
Where have you hidden it, tell me.
I don't know.
You are right Maru, don't give
the drum to these scoundrel!
Don't object in-between!
- I will, the drum is ours...
...why should we give it to them?
Because we have to get
out of this hell alive!
There must be some other way too.
Don't tell anyone anything,
he is gone mad!
Hey, he doesn't try to understand.
- Hey!
Why are these fools fighting?
Which drum are they asking about?
Keep your mouth shut Maru,
we have to get out of here.
They are acting? - Quiet!
What are you doing?
You scoundrel!
Goti, run!
What happened, fight.
Catch them!
Run quickly.
Come on.
Wait.
Run quickly.
Come on, hurry up.
- What are you doing? Come on.
Oh God, I am dead.
- Is there someone?
Maru, why are you lying down
there, come on run.
What are you doing? Come on.
- Come quickly.
I am hurt on my chest.
Sam, Pakiya his head
has been twisted.
Come soon and see.
Turn him and see.
Don't worry Maru, you'll be fine.
Maru, it will be fine.
It will be fine.
What happened?
Beat him. - From this side.
You scoundrels.
Are you all blind?
My head is not twisted the
jacket was.
Why did you wear it like that?
- How would we know?
Have you gone mad?
Run!
Brother Michael, they are the boys.
Catch them.
Run!
There they are.
Look, there they are.
Come on, come on, come on.
If you have the courage! Come on.
If you have the courage!
- Then come and fight!
Our team is with us!
Don't overact.
Seems like they have a
strong force with them.
We will scare them right now.
Leave them now, we will take
care of them later.
We don't want any police mess.
Why have we come here?
To exercise.
We don't have a place to hide...
...and only Ritu can help
us, no one else...
...that's why we will have to
go and tell her the truth.
Then come on.
No, let it get dark first...
...so that no one spots
us entering her house.
As soon as possible, find them out.
He is the one, he is the
one that flogged me.
He is the one that had me
thrashed in the market!
They are the four people,
they have ruined our lives.
They must have killed brother Rahul.
Catch them!
Goti, run!
Hey run. - Come on, hurry up.
I cannot run anymore,
I cannot run anymore.
I am famished running,
in cannot run anymore.
What is this mess, the
police is after us...
...the biker gang is after us,
and also this Mogambo.
Not Mogambo, Zikomo.
- Yes.
What should we do now?
If we run from here, then we
will have to keep running...
...till our deaths.
I am sacred.
Scared, scared of what?
We didn't do anything.
We know that, but in the
view of the world...
...we are cruel people.
Fraud for someone, murderer
and drum thief too.
What is this drum and where is it?
Stupid, If I would have known...
...would I have been
thrashed up so much?
This is not the time to joke.
I am going back to tell
Ritu the truth.
We listened to you and went there...
...earlier there was police, and
now there will the military.
And that dangerous grandma is there.
I don't care, I will go there
and tell Ritu the truth...
...and apologise, believing
it or not is there problem.
You... - Are you coming with me?
- You go, you go.
When they believe you,
send us a telegram...
...we will arrive too.
Yes.
Hello.
You don't know me, can I come in?
You... - My name is Zikomo, and
I am searching for a drum.
What did you say, drum?
Zikomo has abducted Ritu.
He must have taken her
to that petrol pump.
Now? - Now what, we will
have to save her?
Shut your mouth, we
just escaped death...
... it is very difficult
the second time.
Whose help shall we take now,
shall we inform the police?
You fool, stupid you
want to go to jail...
...do you want to go to jail?
You don't shout. Talk softly.
Listen, I have an idea.
Here is the address.
You wanted to know about
Sophie, didn't you?
She is in this bungalow right now.
So old man, you don't know
anything about the drum.
Which drum are you talking about?
We don't know anything.
You don't know, is that
the truth or lie.
I am not Hanuman to show
you Ram in my heart...
...you can understand
whatever you want.
You scoundrel Michael, you
left your number here...
...and asked us to call or
else you will kill us!
Your brother has witnessed
our strength...
...and now it is your turn.
You scoundrel, if you are a man...
...then come to the 13 mile
petrol pump, your...
And listen, bring the shroud along
it will be useful to us!
We will have to cover your corpse.
Give me, give me.
Put the coin in.
Hello is uncle there.
Yes, do you know who is speaking?
It is your death.
You lost your job isn't it, now
you will lose your legs too.
What do you think about yourself,
you scoundrel.
You have earned all the
money from bribery.
You will not die, you will rot!
I heard that you need a donkey.
Come to me, I will slap you so
hard, that you will go deaf.
Where am I, if you
have the courage...
...then come to the petrol
pump at 13 miles...
... me and my people will
be waiting for you.
I will burn you and brush
my teeth with your ashes!
Disconnect it.
Old man listen, earlier too
two people back answered me...
...do you know what happened to them?
One was your own grandson Rahul...
...I tied him up and threw
him on the railway tracks...
... but it seemed like
he committed suicide.
And second his friend,
my own man Jai.
He turned out to be an informer.
He gave the news of my
dealings to the police.
I had tied him up too, but I
threw him in the water tank.
A bit of change in life
is important, isn't it?
And right now you are tied
up too. So think about it.
We have the drum.
'Drum. '
Where is it, in your pocket?
No, outside.
Yes. - But first release them.
Is this a new game of yours?
No we have the drum, and
we don't even need it.
Take the drum, but
first release them.
Yes. - Yes.
Release them.
What is all this?
Don't worry, come her.
Where is the drum?
It is coming, it is coming.
Does it have legs?
No, they are bringing it.
Who, your father?
No, no his uncle. - his...
Look, look they have come.
Yes, look, look they have come.
Kill these scoundrels!
Thrash these scoundrels!
Thrash these scoundrels!
Kill them!
Kill them!
Uncle!
Hey scoundrel! Why
are you hitting me?
You again.
No, no I mistakenly fell on you.
Grandma - You.
where are you running?
"Drums..."
There are so many people
do you find only me?
Put me down.
You scoundrel, come on move.
Sir, please forgive me.
Just a minute, just
a minute I cannot see.
"Drum..."
"Drum..."
Stop! Stop! Stop!
If anyone dares to move, then
I will set you all on fire.
Hey, have you gone mad?
Everything will burn into ashes.
Everyone raise their hand.
Grandpa, come here.
- You keep it down.
Grandma, come here.
Come here.
Pakiya, have you come
here to enjoy...
Come, come. - Come on.
Don't move. Everyone
stand in their place.
Stand in their place.
Stand where you are.
- Come on, hurry up.
Don't move. Or else
I will throw the lighter.
Go that side.
Come on hurry up. Sit inside fast.
- Let me sit too.
Scoundrels, let me sit too.
Come on in. - Let me sit.
There is no space here.
There is no space for me.
Come fast. - Come on.
Oh God!
Leave the house! Right away!
- Why?
Don't ask any question!
It's dangerous for you to stay here!
Zikomo can come here anytime!
- Who? Who?
Pack your bags and come with me!
Sophie! Hurry up!
Come on!
Is there a door upstairs?
- Yes!
Oh! So humans live here!
I thought it's a haunted house.
Sorry! For breaking the house!
Don't be scared! I
won't do anything!
I just want the drum. Nothing else.
What drum? - Everybody is
asking the same thing!
What drum? Whose drum?
It's not important!
The important thing
is where the drum is!
So stop your rubbish.
And quickly tell me!
I don't know! Really!
- You are lying! You are lying!
I know he has left all
his things with you!
And where has he left it!
And I know this because
when I was killing him...
... he was again and again
screaming your name.
There are a few baggages.
But not a drum.
I am asking for the
last time. Tell me.
Later even if you want to tell me,
still you won't be able to speak.
Because dead don't speak.
Sophie, run!
'Drum. '
'Drum. '
'Drum. '
This is the root cause
of all the problems.
I don't know why there was
a war because of this drum.
Give it to me.
- Here.
Here is a gift for all of you.
Remember our friendship.
When will you meet us next?
After 1. 5-2 years I
am going to send...
... Ritu here to look
after our business.
Then if you want, from these four...
You move! From these 3 thieves,
the one who is...
...the most wealthiest and
the strongest, marry him.
Bye! Take care!
Bye! See you!
- Bye!
I don't want any drum! You keep it!
I too don't know how to
play it! You keep it!
Maru needs the drum!
Hang this and start begging! We
have to repay uncle's loan!
This drum has put me into trouble!
I don't want it!
To hell with it.
It contains money!
So this was the mystery of the drum!
We couldn't fathom it!
