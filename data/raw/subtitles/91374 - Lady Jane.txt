Somerset! Somerset!
Save him!
Lord Jesus, save me!
Did he die well?
Yes, he died well.
And now you are in his place.
As what?
As England's ruler, my Lord Duke.
Indeed.
What's that, my Lord?
In the last will of the King's late father,
Henry Vlll of famous memory,
the succession is quite clearly lineated.
The line of his eldest sister,
the Scottish line, ruled out.
So...
...one, his son, King Edward; two,
his elder daughter, the Princess Mary;
three, his younger daughter,
the Princess Elizabeth; four...
...Frances; daughter
of his younger sister;
five, her daughter, Jane.
Surely an academic question. When
the young King is married, has a son...
Exactly. When the young King is married.
The question is, to whom?
Ride on, coachman.
Excuse me. I'm Dr Feckenham.
I'm from the Princess Mary.
- I have letters for the King.
- Out hunting. Catholics!
- And for my Lord the Duke of Suffolk.
- Him, too.
Is there nobody here to receive me?
My Lady Jane?
I am Dr Feckenham.
I am confessor to the Princess Mary.
I know.
How do you do?
You're not out riding?
No.
Plato. In Greek.
It's not easy.
Don't you think so?
"The soul takes flight
to the world that is...
"...eternal...
"...invisible...
"...but there arriving, she is sure of bliss
"and forever dwells in paradise."
In his writing, Plato tells
of the death of Socrates,
condemned for spreading pernicious
religious doctrines to corrupt the young.
What conclusions do you draw?
If men believe things strongly,
they may die for them.
What would you be prepared
to die for, Lady Jane?
I would die to free our people from
the chains of bigotry and superstition.
What superstition did you have in mind?
For example, the idea
that a piece of bread
can become the body
of our Saviour, Father.
Did he not say at his last supper,
"Take, eat, this is my body"?
He also said, "I am the vine,
I am the door."
Was he a vine, a door?
Who has been teaching you
to say such things?
Don't you think
I could have thought them for myself?
I am sorry. Yes, indeed. You are quite
clearly a most remarkable young lady.
And while we will disagree
on many things,
it is a privilege to talk to anyone
whose love of learning shines like yours.
It...
It is my only pleasure...
...Dr Feckenham.
Jane.
Oh. Mother.
How was the hunt?
Quite splendid, thank you, Jane.
Jane.
So there you are.
Yes, Father. This is Dr...
- You should have been out with us.
- This is Dr Feckenham.
Of course, to go out with your family,
out riding, working up a sweat, fresh air,
it's altogether far too base
and brutish, isn't it?
Answer your father, Jane.
Mother, please.
You might think, Father, that
the first born of the House of Suffolk
might be considering her future
in her sixteenth year, you might think.
Instead of poring over books!
She could be... learning things
that might be useful to a husband.
Father!
Don't you think so, Doctor?
Henry! The King.
What were you reading, cousin Jane?
Plato! Good morning, Dr Feckenham.
Do you have the letters from my sister?
Her learning is an example to us all.
Your dancing measure, if you please.
- You know, my Lady...
- Yes.
It must be time to take your daughter
up to London. Show her at Court.
How old is she?
- Fifteen.
- There you are. Same age as the King.
She's been well educated.
That is very clear.
She can be... wilful.
She'll grow out of that.
And she has been brought up
in the reformed religion.
Certainly.
Then I foresee a glittering future
for your daughter, madam.
I had two brothers. Died.
In the same week.
Had a son.
Didn't reach six months.
Your handsome sons
with their lovely wives.
Yes, and I have a third son.
Guilford.
They must be such a joy to you,
John Dudley.
Three such fine...
...upstanding sons.
One more, one more.
Come on.
Guilford, let's go.
A shilling on the eight.
- That was a seven.
- No, an eight.
That was a seven, damn you.
No!
Merry Christmas.
Did you play with puppets
when you were a child?
I seem to have spent my whole life
listening to sermons.
Better now.
- Who is that man?
- Sir John Gates, captain of my guard...
Oh, Jane...
...I feel quite dreadful.
Sire? Edward, in God's name,
what's the matter?
Follow me!
What do I do? What do I do?
Your Grace.
It's all right, Jane, Sir John.
I am recovered.
Better now.
- My Lady Jane.
- My Lord Northumberland.
The King has sent me to inform you
that he is completely recovered.
Well, I am glad.
So much so that there's no need for
anyone to mention that he was ill at all.
- I see.
- I'm glad.
You're asking me to lie.
To refrain from volunteering information.
It cannot be too hard to understand for a
young person who reads Plato in Greek.
Lady Jane. Princess Mary is free
to see you now.
Thank you.
She apologises.
She was finishing a hand of trump.
- Do you play cards?
- No. No, I don't.
You're wise. She's very good.
I see.
Why do you curtsy?
I am curtsying to the Host, my Lady.
To Him that made us all.
I see.
So, God made you
and the baker, apparently, made God.
Well.
- Can this be my little cousin Jane?
- Ma'am.
Now, let me look at you.
How you've grown.
Well, then, embrace me.
And if I were you,
I'd take care, little cousin Jane.
Madam, have you considered
your daughter's future?
- You know I have.
- And can I ask...?
I can see no reason why
she should not marry Edward.
- I can.
- What?
- He's dying.
- What?
He will be dead... who knows, a month?
- God rest his soul.
- Indeed.
What then?
There will not be another
Roman Catholic on the English throne.
The country people don't agree.
They still adhere.
They miss the Latin litanies
and mysteries.
The ornaments and precious things.
Because before King Henry closed the
monasteries, they were in the churches.
They could see them on the altars.
I wonder where those things are now.
Which is why, madam, for you,
and yes, for me as well,
there must not be another
Roman Catholic on the English throne.
- If Edward dies without an heir...
- Then Mary's queen.
Her mother was divorced and Mary was
named a bastard. Next in line's Elizabeth.
Whose mother, Anne Boleyn,
was beheaded for treasonable adultery.
Behold, the next in line becomes
my Lady, the Duchess Frances Suffolk,
who would, of course,
relinquish all her dues and rights
in favour of her daughter, Jane.
Ah, Frances, there you are.
Down, damn you, Jupiter.
Good Lord, are you still eating?
Do you hear me, sir?
- Afternoon, John.
- My Lord.
We were speaking
of Jane's marriage, Henry.
It might be a matter
of peculiar importance
in the event of circumstances
which well might arise.
In fact, I suspect
my Lord has someone in mind.
Perhaps he'd be good enough to tell me.
I don't think you've met my youngest
and as yet unmarried son, Guilford.
He's a quiet and studious boy.
I imagine even now among his books
or else at prayer.
More wine!
No more wine.
- Hey, you!
- Because it's bedtime.
I want him out!
Out!
It's bedtime, Guilford.
Good morning, Mother, Father.
Jane, you know
the Duke of Northumberland.
Indeed I do. My Lord.
Jane, as you know,
the Duke has three fine sons.
Yes, I've been privileged
to meet with Robert and...
- John.
- Yes, John.
- My third son is called Guilford.
- Guilford?
- It was his mother's maiden name.
- I see.
Oh, Jane!
My darling little Jane.
- My little girl, we're so proud of you.
- Oh, no.
- Yes, yes.
- No. No.
Now, Jane, embrace my Lord the Duke.
No.
- What is this?
- I order you.
My Lord, I am most honoured...
...naturally.
I'm sure your son
is a most noble of young men,
but I don't wish to marry
anyone at present.
- You don't wish to marry?
- No!
I wish it and your mother wishes it
and the Duke wishes it.
- And the King wishes you...
- No! That I do not believe!
You don't.
I don't believe that the King wants me
to marry Guilford Dudley.
Ellen, please take your mistress
to the gallery.
- No!
- If you value your position in this house.
- My Lady.
- No!
Stop her! Take her! Take her!
See reason!
- No!
- Take her!
I will not! I won't!
I will not!
She will.
I'm sure her mother will...
Well?
So be it.
Well?
Well?
I just don't see why.
Then I must make you see.
You see, my cousin trusts me.
- I must not betray that trust.
- Your Grace, the battle isn't won.
The battle started by your father
must be carried on by you.
The reformation of your church
is still incomplete,
the danger that your country could
relapse into a pit of popery still great.
I cannot tell you why it matters
that my son should marry Jane.
All I can do is beg Your Grace
to trust me.
Then you'd better fetch my men
to get me dressed.
John.
I do know I'm dying.
You will not marry Guilford Dudley?
Without your family, what are you?
No one. Nothing.
What makes you dare to think
you can choose whom to obey?
- My love!
- Yes, what?
Our daughter has a visitor.
Your Grace.
We would like to speak, madam,
to our cousin Jane. Alone.
Alone.
My Lady Jane. No, no.
I wasn't whipped.
They had a boy. If I did something bad,
they beat him in my place.
See? You should have been born
heir to the throne.
Though, in a way it made it rather worse.
You understand?
But it was his duty,
as it was mine
to suffer for his suffering in my stead.
As it is yours now to obey
your parents and your King.
- Why must you do what he tells you?
- Who?
John Dudley.
Because I trust him.
Look, I brought you something.
What is it?
A puppet.
You pull the cords and it dances.
Let me try.
Oh, look, it does. It works.
Of course it works.
- Look, I can make it bow.
- So I should think.
Oh, Edward.
Oh, it's wonderful.
All better now?
All better now.
Now promise...
...that you'll marry him.
For me.
It's all right, Your Grace. I'm here.
- Three days?
- Or four. Perhaps a week.
No more.
It must be longer.
There must be some way.
No, the only thing is arsenic, which
would keep him more or less alive,
but in excruciating pain.
- There's nothing else?
- Nothing.
- So be it, then.
- My Lord...
Doctor...
...I must have the time.
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Where are they?
- Bastard!
- Where are they?
- Where is he?
- Who?
In there.
Get out, you bastard! Get out!
Lord!
- My Lord, you must come with us.
- Why? What for?
Clear the way!
Congratulations, my Lord.
You're going to be married.
Who to?
You're not to wear black again!
God's teeth!
My dear Guilford.
She wants to see you.
- Who does?
- Your betrothed.
- What, now?
- Yes, now!
- Please tell me this isn't...
- No.
I thought it right...
You may have heard
I was unhappy about this match.
Yes. Yes, I did.
I worried that it would impede
what's important to me,
which is studying and prayer.
So I would prefer when this...
...when this is done, that we lived...
...shall we say as cousins,
rather than as man and wife.
- If that is what you wish.
- It is.
- I should myself make something clear.
- Please do.
On the night I was informed
of my translation into bliss,
I'd attended several taverns,
witnessed a bear-baiting
and was in Southwark, sampling
the pleasures of a lady of the night.
Thus far, I have to tell you,
it had been a very good evening.
Still...
...duty calls.
Dearly beloved friends,
we are gathered here in the sight of God
and the face of His congregation,
to join together this man and
this woman in holy matrimony,
which is an honourable estate
instituted of God in paradise
in the time of man's innocence
and therefore not to be enterprised,
nor taken in hand inadvisedly,
lightly or wantonly to satisfy
men's carnal lusts and appetites,
like brute beasts
that have no understanding,
but reverently, discreetly, advisedly,
soberly, and in the fear of God.
More.
Well, there we are.
How long has he got to live?
- Two weeks, three at the most.
- I see.
But has he yet declared his will?
- The King will preserve the new religion.
- And his Council?
I'm sure that they understand
how the triumph of the new faith has
contributed to their position and wealth.
Plain sailing, then.
Frances, John, there you are.
Speaking of former monasteries,
the King has put
at the disposal of our children
the old priory of Eversholt...
for as long as they have need of it.
You mean, until we have need of them.
Indeed.
- Look, Dudley...
- Yes.
Are you sure your son's the right man
for my daughter?
I can control him.
He can be controlled in matters
that concern us, my Lord Duke.
My Lady...
are you sure you understand?
No, no, there's no need.
It's beautiful.
Don't you think it's beautiful?
Jane?
What's the matter?
Better now.
We oughtn't to get
too far behind the rest.
Whoa, there! Whoa! Whoa, there!
What's this?
I have no idea.
Good day.
Is there...
...anything you want?
My wife and I have come to stay here
at the priory. It's our great pleasure.
As a token of our...
- You know what that is?
- Yes.
- You've been branded.
- Why?
- Begging, I presume.
- That's right. No tribute.
We want our land back!
It's not our fault,
so leave my wife and I alone.
Leave it!
Leave it! Leave it!
Ride on.
Mrs Ellen.
It's lovely. Is there anything to eat?
Yes, of course.
We're on our own.
- We won't be tomorrow.
- What?
The Mayor of Hertford is to dine with us
in the refectory.
- Just the Mayor?
- Accompanied by several aldermen.
God's teeth!
- Glass goblets.
- Yes. A present from your father.
- Made in Venice.
- Yes, I know.
They're very pretty,
but they do have this tendency to break.
Don't you dare.
- What did those men at the gates want?
- I don't know... Food.
- Have they no farms?
- I'm sorry?
- Why were they idle?
- Tell me, did you see his chest?
- Yes. It was marked.
- No, it wasn't.
It was branded, the mark burnt into him
with a red-hot iron.
Do you know why?
Because he'd been caught begging.
Can you think how
he may have fallen into beggary?
The land he used to farm,
on which he had much work to do,
belonged to poor monks in monasteries,
who allowed poor people to grow food.
Until men like our fathers
stripped the monasteries,
fenced in the common land,
drove the peasants from their fields
and passed unholy laws
branding them for beggary!
- They threw all that money back at you...
- Money!
Do you know what's happened
to the value of money?
What's that?
- A penny.
- No, it isn't... it's a shilling.
- It can't be. Shillings are made of silver.
- Should be.
Used to be... but not now.
Which is why a shilling isn't worth
a shilling any more.
You've really no idea what's going on,
have you?
- I know the priests were all corrupt.
- No doubt.
- They told the people to worship icons.
- That concerns me less.
- You're talking of your soul.
- No, you are talking of your mind!
I wonder if you and the reformers
can convince yourselves
that the nature of the sacraments
is more important
than whether
those who receive them live or die!
The brain is a brittle organ.
The slightest pressure and it snaps...
if it isn't wrapped up in a little heart.
I shall have them arrange
another bedroom for me.
- They won't think very much of that.
- I couldn't care less what they think!
What right have you?
You haven't done a thing!
Why don't you go to Court?
Do something about all these things?
Because there isn't any point!
Because it wouldn't work. It never does.
Dear God and all his saints,
what am I doing here?
What do you want?
- I want to say I'm sorry.
- Doesn't matter.
Yes, it does.
- This is not your fault.
- That's true.
Well, then...
Goodnight.
Explain it to me.
What?
What you believe. The schism, the new
learning, the nature of the sacraments.
- Do you really want to know?
- I really want to know.
Well...
It's our belief...
...that faith only saves.
That, as Christ Jesus says, his sons
shall come to God if they believe in him.
Not by the Church?
Not by the Church.
Yes.
And...
...that all superstitions,
ornamental relics...
...and icons...
...and images...
...and...
- Go on.
- Go on?
- With what you were doing.
- With what I was saying?
Not just now.
What do I do?
When did you know?
I didn't.
It just happened.
Did you know about it?
- What?
- What we've just done.
Well...
...only in terms of the broadest
general principles.
Unlike you.
Not exactly.
What?
You're referring to my lady of the night.
Well, yes, I was.
