       The missus says          
       she got a visual,        
  but she's fuzzy on details.   
 It was dark.                   
 She was upstairs looking down  
 through her window.            
    Said she was pretty sure    
    she saw a white female,     
    but couldn't guarantee.     
  She's still a little shaken,  
  but, uh,                      
      maybe when she calms      
      down a little...

 Disgruntled employee,

 No! No! No one we know         
 would do something like this.  
           Of course.           
          Had to ask.           
      There's been a rash       
      of home invasions         
    over the past few weeks,    
   so I'm sure this was         
   in connection with those.    
    But who would               
    do something like this?     
      Runaways, hippies,        
      radicals, dropouts.

   it all here in California.

   but nothing                  
   I can share at the moment.   
 The good news is,              
 they've all been               
 relatively minor infractions.  
     People sneaking in,        
     moving things around.      
   MARY: Excuse me, Officer.    
     This doesn't seem          
     to be something minor.     
      It certainly didn't       
      feel minor.               
  No. No, I'm sure it didn't.   
  I admit, this one seems like  
  they're stepping things up.   
   Who knows what might         
   have happened if you         
   didn't call when you did.    
    I just don't understand.

 figured out all wrong somehow. 
            How so?             
  Because I never               
  figured you to be             
  the sort of trust fund girl   
   who would go crawling back   
   to mommy and daddy           
   as soon as they threatened   
   to stop sending the dough.   
 I'm not crawling back to them. 
     Oh, no. They're flying     
     you first class.           
     That's bad. I'm sorry.     
   I'm not leaving              
   because my parents           
   threatened to cut me off.    
   I'm leaving because I feel   
   like it's time to move on.   
      I don't fit in here.      
  This whole city is populated  
  by people who feel            
  like they don't fit in.       
  Look, I never told you this,  
        but a year ago,         
      I was gonna give up.      
      Just pack it all in.      
    But then I convinced        
    myself to give it           
    another couple of weeks.    
         What happened?         
           I met you            
         on that beach.         
   And it was then I decided    
  that I was gonna give myself  
  as long as it takes.          
   Because no matter what       
   happens with the business    
   and all that,                
   there was always Abigail.    
      No, Wojciech, you...      
           (CHUCKLES)           
 You can't make me responsible  
 for your dreams, too.          
    I'm not. I'm not.           
    I'm just trying             
    to convince you to stay,    
 so you don't give up on yours. 
     There's a reason           
     that you don't fit in.     
       It's not because         
       you're different.        
    It's absolutely             
    because you're special.

   Friday night in Los Angeles, 
     a movie actress            
     and four of her friends    
     were murdered.             
      And the circumstances     
      were lurid.               
   REPORTER ON TV:  The crime   
    scene resembled a strange,  
    religious ritual.           
    A maid discovered           
    the bodies in the morning,  
        and went screaming      
        for neighbors.          
 A wandering band of members    
 of a so-called religious cult, 
 with a leader they call Jesus, 
    has had three               
    of its followers arrested.  
    WOMAN ON TV:                
    Uh, we drove to the house   
 with instructions              
 to kill everyone in the house. 
   I felt absolutely            
   nothing for her              
   as she begged for her life.  
     One of the people said,    
     "Who are you?"             
   And Tex said,                
   "I'm the devil, and I'm here 
   to do the devil's business." 
      MANSON:  Believe me.      
 If I started murdering people, 
   there'd be none of you left. 
       Because my children      
       are coming.
