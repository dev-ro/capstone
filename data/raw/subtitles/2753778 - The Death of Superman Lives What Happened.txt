"Nerds."
"Geeks." "Sweaties."
Look how far we've come.
We rule the world.
But it wasn't always this way.
Let's go back to a time
when there was no comic book
cinematic universe,
when you had to wait three years
to get a superhero movie,
back to a time when Batman
used a credit card.
This is a film about a superhero movie
that didn't get made.
In 1998, a movie called "Superman Lives"
was in production.
It was going to be directed
by Tim Burton
and star Nicolas Cage as Superman.
I've been fascinated with this
since I first heard about it.
From the concept design
to the various scripts
to the people involved,
this would've been the most craziest,
cosmic Superman movie ever made.
( crowd chattering )
Schnepp: What do you think
the "Superman Lives" movie
that Tim Burton and Nicolas Cage
were going to make,
what do you think that movie
would've been like?
Nicolas Cage is probably
one of our generation's
definitive actors.
I don't know if he'd be able
to pull it off or not.
But it would've been interesting.
It's one of those "what ifs."
I saw some of the artwork,
and I just didn't--
It just didn't fly with me.
There's nothing about his face
that fits, nothing about his voice
that fits that deep Superman voice
that you can trust.
It just seems kind of hilarious.
I'm sorry, God. No.
Nicolas Cage is a great actor,
so I think he could've
played that really well.
We all watched George Reeves
and I watched Christopher Reeve.
I wasn't like,
"That's George Reeves. Chris Reeve."
It was Superman.
Nic Cage, he, like--
That's Nic Cage as Superman.
Nic Cage would've been awesome.
I mean, I-- Still one of my favorites is
"Wild at Heart" with him.
I just figure that guy as Superman
would be awesome.
The attempts to make
superhero movies in the '90s
weren't particularly
successful, I felt.
Dick Tracy did the same
or the Joel Schumacher "Batman" movies
did the same,
with the costumes super bright
and primary-colored,
and the idea of trying to create
what a comic would look like on screen--
Obviously, it would've been
interesting to see it.
It'd be pretty weird to see Nicolas Cage
as Superman.
"Superman Lives" was basically written
by three different screenwriters:
Kevin Smith, Wesley Strick
and Dan Gilroy.
All three scripts revolved
around the same story
basically taken
from the comic book series,
"The Death of Superman,"
where Superman fought the villains
Lex Luthor,
Brainiac,
and the killing machine, Doomsday.
Doomsday killed Superman
in the comic books,
and then he came back to life
using Kryptonian technology.
This revitalized
the comic book series.
Warner Brothers took their cue
from the comic books
to revitalize
their movie franchise.
On the set of "Superman Returns,"
at any moment in Video Village,
Bryan had sort of a little, like--
It was like a little binder.
No one could really touch it.
And inside he had this photograph
of Nicolas Cage
from Tim Burton's
aborted version of "Superman."
Oftentimes we'll be
in studio executive meetings,
and people will bitch about the fact
that Brandon Routh's costume
is so similar to the comics,
that it has the underwear,
that it looks a little kitschy.
And so, Bryan,
whenever that would happen in a meeting,
would snap his fingers and have
his assistant pull out this photograph,
and it would instantly
shut them up.
He would reach over
to Video Village,
pick up his book, and he would say,
"You know,
you guys were gonna make this.
We're not making this."
Schnepp:
Sometimes the interest in the "what if"
is stronger than
the actual final product
because it fills your mind
with the possibilities
of what could've been.
That's something that interested me
when I saw
the concept art
for "Superman Lives."
Amazing, strange designs,
cosmic ideas,
creatures, aliens,
Superman with a strange metal "S."
All these things interested me,
and I wanted to find out why
it never got made.
Morrison:
Imagine a distant planet
in a far-off star system,
light-years from here.
We've never seen it in our telescopes,
we know nothing about them,
but they look a bit like us.
A star in the last days
of its life,
and imagine that their planet
is under threat of destruction,
and those fantastic scientists say
there's only one thing they can do,
and that's to send a child
out into space
who might carry the physical attributes
and mental attributes
of these people have engendered
over the centuries.
And imagine then that this child
coming to Earth
suddenly is gifted with powers
that come from a great society
that it gave birth to,
and he not only brings those powers
but he brings a morality.
Just imagine what he could do
to our world
with the aim of changing it
and making us better.
( upbeat music plays )
"Superman Lives--"
or "Superman Reborn"
and then "Superman Lives"
and then later
"Superman Returns,"
was meant to be kind of, like,
let's kick-start Superman again
in a bit more earnest way.
Not the spit-curl and wink
of Chris Reeve and Dick Donner.
They wanted a '90s version
of Superman,
even though when I was writing,
all I was writing was Chris Reeve.
I thought Bryan Singer's version
forgot to put in--
- Action?
- Yeah, like, fuckin'--
He didn't get to punch anybody.
He punched an island.
And then somebody pointed out,
they're like, "Superman doesn't
get to punch everything
every movie,"
and I thought about it
and looked back, and sometimes
he didn't punch shit.
He fought some video game-type things
in "Superman III."
Fought good taste
in "Superman III."
- Fought himself, remember?
- Turned purple and--
Drinking whiskey,
burning the peanuts.
Smith: I can see why Bryan Singer
was sucked into doing
a quasi sequel to the Dick Donner
Superman movies.
Those were our Superman movies.
They were so fucking magical.
And they found a way to make them work
where your parents could sit there
and be like,
"Yeah, all right. He's fighting
General Zod. I get it."
They're not like, "This is horseshit."
They're like, "I can get behind this."
So, there's a pull to it
because it's the classic lore
and Dick Donner did
such a great job with it.
Jon Peters: "Superman" was something
I had seen with Dick Donner and I loved,
and I was mesmerized by it.
So that was the granddaddy
of all the superheroes.
I've made over 100 movies,
movies that I did
with Polygram Pictures
and all the movies that we've produced
and everything.
I was the chairman of Sony,
and I was leaving.
Peter and I were splitting up.
And they said to me,
"You're not going to believe this,
but we think
Superman is available.
So I got into negotiation
with the Salkinds and their lawyers
because Warner Brothers
had not picked up the option.
They didn't know that.
It was before computers.
So they would have to send someone
in a back room, "bing, bing, bing,"
going through these things that--
It's not on a computer--
Would-- Would be normally red-flagged.
I got a call from Terry Semel,
who was the head of Warner Brothers
who said, "We want you
to come back to the studio."
And I said, "I'm working on something
now which is really what I want to do."
I had made "Batman."
And he said, "What?"
And I said, "I think I bought
the rights to Superman.
He said, "You idiot.
Warner Brothers owns it. I own it."
I said, "No, you don't. Check."
Came back and said,
"You're right. You do."
Essentially, if you read my script
for "Superman Lives,"
it's like fan fiction.
It's-- It's-- And-- And, fuck,
I was so nascent in my career.
I was 26 years old, 27 years old.
'96, '97.
So, I sat down and met with
a creative exec named Basil Iwanyk.
He goes, "What would you think about
'Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian?'"
I said, "That exists?"
He's like, "Yeah, we've been trying
to figure out 'Beetlejuice' for years."
I was like, "What's to figure out?
Burton cracked the code."
He goes, "Well, you know,
we've been working on--
Trying-- Working a Superman."
And I was like, "Superman?"
That was no part
of the meeting that I was going in for,
it just came up in conversation.
But he had given me
the Superman script to take home.
And, oh, good Lord.
Terrible title from the jump.
It might as well have just said:
It was just not the Superman movie
I ever would've imagined.
There was a scene in it
I remember specifically where
Clark Kent's going to a psychiatrist
and talking about
having this
"I'm Superman" conversation,
and the psychiatrist is like,
"No, you're not."
This is something for a comic book fan,
particularly at that time
and place in my life.
I was like, "Oh, why don't you
just piss on the Gospels, fuck!
Why don't you just make Jesus
do dick jokes? This is ridiculous!"
Why not just reach out to the guys
who do the comic books?
They would get it.
This guy don't get it.
And he goes, "Yeah, but those guys
are comic book guys."
I swear to you.
That was 1996 mentality.
Get another call from my agent,
he goes,
"You made it all the way
up the chain, dude.
You're going to meet
with Lorenzo di Bonaventura,
the head of Warner Brothers."
I was like, "Really?"
I was the executive
in charge of it
for quite a period of time
at Warner Brothers.
Jon Peters came
to Warners and said,
"Listen, I think we can put
all these rights together."
We put the rights together.
Kevin Smith came in
with a really great take.
Lorenzo was the first one
to ever say this
of everyone I met with:
He goes, "All right, what would you
do differently?"
And I was like, "Oh. Well..."
I changed the title.
It wasn't "Superman Reborn."
I wanted to call it
"Superman Lives."
I thought
that sounded cool,
plus "Fletch Lives"
had always sounded cool to me.
So I was like, "Let's borrow that
from "Fletch Lives,"
call it 'Superman Lives.'"
More of a, "Yeah, that's more than
Superman Reborn."
Same idea, but to me,
a little bit better.
He's going, "I want to send you over
to meet with Jon Peters."
I know who he is, he's a producer,
you know, he's a producer
with Peter Guber
of "Rain Man,"
of 1989's "Batman," of course.
His history is that
he was a hairdresser--
A stylist, whatever--
I don't mean to diminish.
He did hair, coifs,
whatever they're called.
So, he was a hair man,
and he worked for Barbra Streisand.
They would up being in a relationship
and stuff like that.
He wound up being a producer.
What an American dream.
You go from hair-- Barbra Streisand's
hairdresser to producing "Batman."
I don't think people get over the fact
that I started as a hairdresser.
If I went to Harvard,
it would probably be less different.
Jon Peters comes in: "I hear
you've got a take on 'Superman.'"
And I was like, "Yeah, yeah."
He's going, "Okay. Well, let me tell
you-- Let me hear it, let me hear it."
Kevin came in.
I felt free with him.
He was kind of an interesting character.
We talked about
a lot of different things.
He was such a nut,
and he had-- He was so animated,
and he talked a great game,
that I trusted him.
And he goes, "Okay.
Three things I want with this picture.
"I'm gonna send you on your way,
do your thing, come back.
Number one:
I don't want to see him fly."
I said, "Okay. Ever?"
He goes, "No, I think it looks fake.
I hate all that flying shit,
so I don't want to see him fly."
I said, "Okay."
"Number two: I don't want
to see him in that suit."
I was like, "Which suit?"
And he's going, "That suit.
The suit he's always wearing."
I was like, "The Superman suit
with the cape and the blue
and red and yellow?"
He goes, "Yeah, I don't like it."
His words, not mine: "Too faggy."
I said, "Uh, all right."
You gave him some notes and said,
"Three things I don't want:
"I don't want him to fly,
I don't want him in that costume..."
That's-- None of that's true.
None of that's true.
Of course he has to fly.
He always flew.
Superman you're talking about?
Of course he's in the co--
None of those are true.
Is there a third?
Smith: Number three is he has to fight
a giant spider in the third act.
I said, "Okay-- Really?"
- Then he has to fight a giant spider.
- That was a Thanagarian Snare Beast.
"What is this based on?"
He goes, "Well, do you know
anything about spiders?
Spiders are the fiercest killers
in the animal kingdom.
You've got to be careful
around spiders.
So if you have a big one,
imagine how deadly they are.
I'm looking for my moment
in this movie,
like "King Kong" when I was a boy
and they opened the gates
and you saw the giant monkeys."
Going, "I want to open up the gates,
and then you see
this gigantic spider
coming at him.
Superman's got to fight the spider.
It's a vision I have."
I was like, "Okay, man,
I'll spider it up for you and stuff."
If I remember correctly,
I acted as the director
for a while
by bringing in people and starting
some of my concepts on paper
so that ultimately when I brought in Tim
or whoever we brought in,
I could sit down and say,
"This is where we are, what we've done."
Jon Peters wanted to convince
the higher-ups to invest in a movie
that is going to have
something other than
another guy in Spandex
fighting Superman.
My initial job was to come up with
this big scary frickin' thing
with a body kind of based on
a black widow
but a face more like
a tarantula.
And I threw in maybe
a little crab and stuff in there too.
One of the illustrations was what--
It was a Giger-esque kind of thing
and it's what they called
the Opening of the Yanni,
and all these little face-hugger
mini spiders
are coming down
and covering Superman.
He's not going up against
a super villain.
He's going up against
the Alien or the Predator
or something that will
try and kill him
and maybe eat him
or lay eggs in his eyeballs.
That to me is super cool,
'cause it takes it to a different level
that we haven't seen before.
This was all out of my mind.
The Thanagarian Snare Beast,
I stole it from Jules Verne's
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.
This giant squid who tries
to swallow up this submarine.
- With the big, snapping squid--
- Giant nautilus, maybe.
Yes. So Superman would fight
every tentacle,
getting closer
and closer and closer
to this beak till he killed it.
It would've made an amazing sequence!
Amazing!
I had appeased Warner Brothers
by not calling it a spider.
- I called it a Thanagarian Snare Beast.
- Another Hawkman reference.
A little Hawkman reference.
The planet Thanagar, something like--
Just little things to throw in.
And the Warner Brothers execs were like,
"As long as it doesn't say spider,'
we don't give a shit.
We know it's a spider.
Call it what you--
I mean, snare beast'? Come on."
What made you want to tell
the death of Superman?
I love dramatic structures,
so the idea
was
"The Death of Superman: Chaos Rules"
really I knew could be amazing.
I just felt it in my bones.
They wanted to do
the "death of Superman" storyline
that had been done very successfully
in the comics a few years before.
"Death and return" storyline.
Schnepp: It was 1993,
exactly seven years
since the theatrical and critical bomb
"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace."
"Superman" comics were just
not selling anymore,
so D.C. Comics decided
to do the unimaginable
and kill Superman.
We had thought of doing
"The Death of Superman" before.
We had sort of lightly kicked
the idea around,
and it felt like this could be
the time to do it.
My frustration in working
on the comic book was that
he didn't seem to have
anybody he could have
a knockdown, drag-out,
bash-'em-up,
take-down-half-a-city
fight with.
With Doomsday, we wanted
a creature and a villain
that was not cerebral
in any way, shape, or form.
We wanted him to be
a hurricane personified,
a force of nature,
a raging beast,
because that's something
that is very different than Superman.
And that's what we wanted
Doomsday to be.
It was one of those jobs
where I was just like,
"Fuck it, write your dream movie,"
you know you what I'm saying?
It's the dream job. Go crazy.
Because whoever's going to direct it
is going to change anything
they don't like anyway.
I had the Eradicator in there.
I had Cyborg Superman.
Lex Luthor was in there,
Doomsday was in there.
Brainiac was the villain.
It was packed.
One of the things that
your script actually brought in
that now everyone's doing
is the crossover.
You actually had not only
a lot of different villains,
like, Deadshot was in it,
but you also had Batman.
That's right.
There was a sequence where
it was during Superman's funeral,
very dramatic.
It was clearly written by a Batman fan.
It was almost the whole reason
I took the job
was just to write this cameo.
It's kind of like Times Square.
They got TVs everywhere.
And then they all just go,
( imitates cha-chunk ).
They've just taken over
and there's a big bat symbol,
and then he comes on
and gives them this
message of encouragement.
Like, "People of Metropolis,
your hero has fallen."
Like, real fucking, like, wank stuff
if you're a huge comic book nerd.
Turn it in,
Lorenzo's like, "I like this."
Basil's like, "I like this."
And Jon, his people,
like Tracy Barone, who was running
his company at that point, Tracy goes,
"You're going to come over tomorrow
to have a meeting with Jon, right?"
I said, "Talk about the script?"
She goes, "To read the script."
And I go, "What do you mean,
Read the script'?"
And she's going, "He likes to have
the script read to him out loud."
And I was like,
"Get out of here, man.
Do you want me to, like,
tuck him in after I'm done?"
She's going, "I'm serious."
First of all,
I'm not a good reader, number one.
Number two, everyone sometimes
reads things differently.
But you can-- When you see it,
it's pretty much what you see.
I said, "I understand I'm going
to read you a script."
He's going,
"Totally. Let's do this, man."
He lays down on his couch,
tennis shorts on and stuff,
and he's looking up at the ceiling,
and he goes like this.
He was making director hands
as he was laying there,
and this was the movie screen
that he was placing onto his ceiling
so that as I was reading,
he was seeing it on a canvas.
I'm a visual guy,
so, I-- I...
Most things I do by visualization.
Every script I ever get,
I have someone read it to me,
and I just lay back and listen,
and I run it on my screen
in my brain.
And at one time he stops and goes,
"Oh, nothing's happening.
"You've got Brainiac
coming to the Fortress of Solitude.
There's no fight.
Where's the fight?
Fuckin' have somebody
up there, man.
Have him, like, Brainiac fighting
Superman's guards."
And I go, "Well, it's called
the Fortress of Solitude."
Like, nobody's fucking up there, dude.
He's alone.
Plus, why would Superman need guards?
He's Superman, dude.
Like, think about it.
And he goes,
"Well, what about polar bears?"
And I go, "Polar bears?"
And he goes,
"Polar bears are the fiercest killers
in the animal kingdom."
I'm sure there were 50 other ideas
we could've come up with,
but at the time,
we wanted to animate those things
or whatever we created
as something he could fight.
And there's nothing
more ferocious
than a 3,000-pound giant,
12-foot, 15-foot polar bear.
I remember reading a version--
I don't know if you're--
There's two drafts that are--
Of yours that are online--
There's one has Brainiac going
to the Fortress of Solitude,
and there's two polar bears that--
Who see him--
- Smith: Right.
- ( snarls )
Schnepp: And I was like,
"Are they the guards,
and he fucks one up...
- and the other one scamps away?
- ( cries out )
- That's it.
- Okay, but then
this one that I was reading
earlier this week,
that has the polar bears
just as statues outside.
Because I was reading,
I was like, "Am I tripping?"
So I was combing through it,
trying to find--
But I think it was-- I don't know if
it was Tom Lassally or Lorenzo going,
"Why is Brainiac killing an animal?"
And I was like, "Because Jon thought
that he needed to fight
Superman's guards
up at the Fortress of Solitude."
Lorenzo's like,
"Why would Superman need guards?"
I was like, "I know, right?
But whatever."
Who else was on your plate
for directing the Superman film?
Tim Burton was
my number-one choice.
And obviously,
I didn't want to make a "Superman"
that anybody else had made,
and I really wanted to run Superman
through his brain.
And they were like,
"Who do you see as director?"
And I was like, "Tim Burton."
Look what he did for "Batman."
I know this is a fundamental
different character,
but it's Tim Burton.
You can't go wrong.
If you're going to bring a superhero
back to the big screen,
you tap him again.
I had no idea when I said that
I was just signing my own
"You're fucking fired, fat boy"
warrant.
- Kevin handed in his draft...
- Right.
I called him,
and it just was no good.
It wasn't funny.
It wasn't-- it had no structure to it.
It was just unimaginative.
He was an amateur writer.
He wasn't a crafted writer.
Schnepp:
What were your major influences,
like, what were your favorite characters
when you were a kid,
started growing up?
Tim Burton: I loved movies,
mainly monster movies
and Ray Harryhausen movies,
but I guess the genre that--
You know,
horror movies, monster movies,
science fiction films.
I think my favorite--
My favorite comic character
was Batman.
Just getting into sort of psychology
of the superhero--
That was, at that time,
sort of new territory,
and so when I got involved
with "Superman,"
it was just a different
sort of, you know,
sort of exploration of
that kind of feeling
of being different
and feeling like
somebody from another planet.
Those kinds of themes
were always quite strong
in old monster movies
and in some of the comic books.
The graphic novel came into play,
and the sort of psychology
of the characters.
Obviously,
a lot of comic book characters
fit into that kind of mythology
of somebody
who doesn't fit in,
doesn't belong.
That sort of exploration of
feeling like an alien on a planet
and being different
and having to sort of
hide yourself in some ways
and suppress certain sides
of yourself,
and the sort of secretive nature
of that kind of a character.
So that, I think,
was the thing that was--
the root of it
was the most interesting.
Hearing Tim's inspiration
for the character
was a great moment
where you were like,
"Oh, God."
In a way, it's so obvious,
but of course
the best ideas are not
that easy to get to.
When you give him
the Thanagarian snare beast
with all these characters,
Tim Burton goes to work.
He is such a visualist
that he makes things happen
through his mind, you know,
that sometimes are not
even on the page.
There was a little school
called Cal Arts
that all of us guys were at
way back in the late '70s.
It was at Disney
that we all went to
following that,
and Tim and I started
to work together there.
Another project
that Tim and I worked on together
was an experiment with
stop-motion animation for which
I took Tim's designs
and created puppets
and three-dimensional sets.
It's basically the story
of a little boy
who thinks
that he's Vincent Price.
Heinrichs: I was just finishing up
"The Big Lebowski" for the Coen brothers
and got the call
from the line producer.
It sounded like
a really great idea.
It was gonna be a somewhat
different take on the--
on the myth of Superman.
I had worked with other
great artists--
those are guys that I-- that had been
part of the Hollywood scene.
The day before I got the call
to do this show,
I had just signed on to do
the first "Matrix."
Then had to quit that the next day
because I got the call from Tim.
So I just immediately quit and said,
"No, I'm going to do 'Superman'."
I'd already done
two shows for Tim.
I'd done "Batman Returns"
and "Mars Attacks!"
Pete Von Sholly was there
doing monster
and creature designs.
Michael Jackson, the storyboard artist,
gave my name to Rick Heinrichs
because they needed
a bunch of monsters
for Brainiac's zoo.
He and I worked for a few weeks
and just filled a wall
with monsters.
Sylvain was great
because he-- he had
that Moebius kind of feel
to his work-- he's French.
He worked with and knew Moebius.
I remember asking Rick,
"Are you sure I'm the right person?"
'Cause I grew up in Europe.
My style as an illustrator
when I was doing that work
was mostly European.
I don't have any connection
with the American superhero
comic book mindset.
But Rick said,
"No, that's precisely what we want."
He said, "We've already got the guys
who come from comics,
and we want to diversify a little bit.
We want to see what somebody
who comes from Europe
with a completely different take
can give us."
So I joined the crew, and, uh...
- and entered hell.
- Mm.
Veteran illustrator Jack Johnson
was doing Greek wash paintings
for the production.
Jacques Rey doing lots of beautiful
concept design.
Jim Carson was there.
We all worked together.
Most of us worked in a bullpen.
I don't know.
There was, ah, four or five of us.
There was myself,
there was Jacques Rey,
Harold Belker.
Harold usually does
I.D. design, vehicle design,
so it would've been
something of that nature.
What about Boes?
Boes was in and out.
He had an office down the hall.
Well, Rick Heinrichs,
who we got to know
really well on
"Nightmare Before Christmas."
He promoted me to be
the assistant art director on that show,
and then I moved to L.A.
to sort of start my Hollywood career.
Working on a movie lot--
you know, I'm from San Francisco,
and this was like
a big deal for me.
It was a really great moment
in my life.
Stage 15 has an office upstairs,
and at the beginning
of Warner Brothers--
the logo,
you know the logo?
It shows that moment.
It shows stage 15--
that balcony--
so it's something
that I always remember.
Every time I watch a
Warner Brothers movie, I'm just like,
"That's where we did
'Superman Lives.'"
I'm more of a nuts-and-bolts
kind of guy.
I mean, I, you know,
kind of run the operation.
I make sure that the crew
is there, hired,
that we're moving along
at a good pace.
You know, I got a little bit involved
in more of the creative on this
because we had a lot of R & D
going on with graphics
and also all the visuals
that we were gonna do.
I guess this was the late '90s,
and we were doing
a lot of things at that time.
I mean, the business was absolutely
exploding, in its prime.
Yeah, this was the kind
of that genesis of when
production companies
were getting savvy to the fact
that they could get the best price
and the best quality work
out of companies like my own
by pitting three or four companies
against each other
and basically
creating a contest.
They said, "Show us this crazy,
whacked-out"--
with notes from Tim--
the wildest, most iridescent
soap-bubble
light-up-Las-Vegas-sign arm
as a test, as a prototype,
and you could make a couple
if you want.
And so we worked and worked
and worked
and came up with a couple
of these prototypes.
I believe we did three.
They said, "Wow, this stuff's great.
Nobody else came close
to what you're doing.
Tim loves 'em. Let's go.
Let's take the next step."
I'm like, "Well, I don't even know
what we're building.
What's the next step?"
Number one, we had worked with
Colleen Atwood the--
who always does Tim's stuff
as a wardrobe designer.
She's pretty amazing.
I met Tim on
"Edward Scissorhands,"
which was my first collaboration
with him.
You know, we just hit it off
and we had a good run on that.
And then when "Superman" came up,
it was, you know,
a different kind of movie
for me at the time to do.
I hadn't ever done any kind of
big, kind of, superhero-y
sort of things at all.
With Tim, you always start,
you know, with, like what his--
who he thinks the people are,
like his sort of take on it,
which is always unique
and what makes him Tim
and special, I think.
And his take on "Superman"
was, you know,
was a new kind
of version of it.
He didn't want to go with
the sort of Mr. Clean version.
He wanted to go with kind of this
unnoticed kind of person.
But with Tim, you see this
recurring theme of the outsider
in a lot of his films.
He's interested in characters
who kind of
carry this extraordinary capability
or gift of some kind--
you'll see this
in a lot of his films--
and how that character interacts
with the outside world.
They don't often connect well.
Part of them needs to stay hidden
because if you were to reveal
their real self,
it would be calamitous
for that character.
Schnepp: Batman also had
like a secondary role.
He was Bruce Wayne,
and then he was Batman,
with the Superman character,
there was Clark Kent.
What was your take on Clark Kent?
Well, it-- you know,
it's like you said,
it's slightly similar,
but this is on a much grander,
you know, this is like
on a global scale, in a way,
in the sense
of having to hide.
And, uh, you always try to put
your personal feelings into it.
And I always felt like I was an alien.
So I think a lot of people do
and a lot of kids do.
So that very simple
through my...
that was probably
the core thing, in a way.
That for me was, I think,
the main thing
that interested me.
All of us feel like aliens.
Nobody is comfortable
in their own skin
all of the time,
and we all feel that darkness.
And I wanted him to be able
to talk about that darkness
in a way that would be
interesting for the audience.
I think the humanizing of Superman
was what I would look at
as sort of
Tim's approach to him
that made me really get excited,
made Warners get excited.
I remember I was in
Hartford, Connecticut,
doing press for "Chasing Amy."
I got the phone call.
"They just brought on Tim Burton."
I was like, "So, do you think
I get to stay on for the whole show?"
He goes, "Oh, no, you're done."
Tim Burton came on and goes,
"I don't want to do this script.
I want to do my version
of 'Superman.'"
And so I guess--
I don't know
who the screenwriter was,
maybe Wesley Strick.
I got involved
because I had worked with Tim
on "Batman Returns"
about six years earlier.
I ended up staying
for the whole shoot
because he felt like
he needed a writer
at his side through the process.
I remember him sort of complaining
about making superhero movies.
He compared it to
Chinese water torture.
I asked him, "If you hate it so much,
why are you doing the sequel?"
And he said, "'Cause I think I learned
a lot doing the first 'Batman' movie,
and I want a second movie in which
I can put to use everything I learned"
and sort of undo the mistakes
he felt he had made in the first one.
I knew that there was
a Kevin Smith script.
I read it without any
preconceived idea about it.
But as I read it,
there was a lot about it I didn't--
it wasn't sort of clicking with me.
It's 'cause I'm not a sort of
Superman fanboy.
'Cause I hadn't read any of
the "Death of Superman" graphic novels,
so I wasn't up to speed
with all that stuff.
I was just sort of curious
what Tim's take on it was.
So we met-- I remember we met at the
Chateau Marmont in the lobby there,
and I said, um, "So, Tim,
I read the Kevin Smith script,"
and before I was finished
with my sentence, he said,
"I don't want to talk
about that script."
I was like, "Okay.
So, what do you want to--
like, what do you wanna do?"
And he wasn't sure.
We also were told by Warners
there were aspects of Kevin's plot,
if not his script per se,
that they wanted to keep intact.
Obviously, it was-- it was still based
on "The Death of Superman,"
to some extent.
Jon Peters
was very much involved
right from the get-go,
and Tim was,
I think, really ambivalent
about that, too.
He had-- he had already had a sort of
bad experience with Peters on "Batman"
and told me that the reason
he went to London to film it
was to get away from Peters.
And now he was making this movie--
the "Superman" movie in L.A.
in the same city as Jon,
and he was a little--
already uptight about it.
I think he'd kind of--
could see the future.
Jon is a force of nature,
and he's passionate about things,
and that's, I think,
where that sometimes,
where it becomes, you know, the problem.
You know,
it's-- it's-- it's-- it's...
it's like trying to control
the weather, you know?
It's-- it's not--
it's kind of not...
can't really do it.
You have to, you know,
even though you're the producer,
people just get mad at me--
I'm controlling, overbearing,
a force of nature,
all these crazy things--
only because it takes
tremendous energy
to move most people
who say it can't be done,
and most people
have no energy,
into being able to see the same vision
and then get the money to do it.
What Tim and I always discussed
vis-a-vis "Superman" versus "Batman"
was that "Superman"
takes place in daylight,
in sunlight.
Batman was--
came out at night.
I mean,
that was sort of the--
the real sort of yin-yang
of the two characters.
And Tim was excited about doing it,
'cause I think he felt
that a lot of his movies were, sort of,
movies made in the shadows
- and darkness...
- Right.
...and all of that and he--
I think he wanted to challenge himself
to see if he could make a movie
that was brighter, sunnier,
maybe a little more optimistic
than what he was accustomed to doing.
Schnepp:
So you basically changed Batman.
You were the one
who came in and said,
"We're gonna get Batman
a brand-new look."
We didn't really have the Internet
back in 1988,
when you were shooting this,
so the grumbling whiners
and complainers
didn't get a chance to attack
as hard as they do nowadays.
Where I just related
to people like, you know,
Nicolas Cage as Superman,
what a weird choice.
Or the same could be said
or Michael Keaton.
But that-- you know,
luckily, you're right.
It was before the Internet.
But there definitely was...
I luckily was here in England,
but I know that--
I had heard
there was a huge backlash
to that just because they thought,
"Oh, it's gonna be like a joke."
Even back then, luckily enough,
you know, I mean,
there wasn't the analysis
that you get...
- The breakdown, yeah.
...'cause it's like picking apart
the carcass before
it's even dead yet, you know?
No, it's true.
Welcome to the Internet.
That's, uh, 5,000 people
all have solid opinions.
- Yeah.
- Die.
Yeah.
( chuckles )
Michael Keaton had done a movie
called "Clean and Sober,"
which I saw, and I thought,
"This guy is a genius actor."
The shouting about Michael Keaton
as Batman
was so fucking loud
and proliferate
in 1988, '89,
that even though
the Internet didn't exist,
the Internet was still mad.
Like that's how fucking big it was.
People were like,
"What? Mr. Mom?"
Keaton: I also want to say
something in response to all the folks
who were, uh-- who kept those cards
and letters coming, you know?
All you got to do
is tell me no, baby.
The reason he worked for me
is that because,
you know, he looked like somebody
who needed to dress like a bat
to intimidate people.
I knew, being a street fighter
my whole life,
that you can gauge the toughness
of your opponent
by the look in their eyes.
And Michael Keaton
had that look.
And it's lights out!
Now, you wanna get nuts?
Come on!
Let's get nuts.
And I had just read "The Dark Knight,"
uh, the Frank Miller comic book.
So I was like,
"I want a badder-ass Batman."
- I wanted a darker Batman.
- Right.
And I grew up as a little kid
watching the Adam West Batmans,
and this Batman that came out
- was exactly what I wanted it.
- It was
and it did almost a billion dollars
in those days,
because we had a line where--
when he comes up he says, "I'm Batman,"
the line from the movie was,
"I'm Batman, motherfucker."
And Warners made me take out
the "motherfucker."
And I wanted to do that 'cause I knew
the kids in the audience would go,
"Yeah! All right!"
There were lots of reasons
why he chose, you know, Michael,
and so I knew, you know,
in my heart that--
and we weren't making a joke,
but there was-- I mean, you're right.
If the Internet had been around then,
it would've been...
Oh, it's like they just did--
I mean, they just announced something
- with Ben Aff-- you know what I mean?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Poor guy.
You know, it's like,
you know,
I'm sure he can handle it,
but, you know,
it's tough out there.
Yeah.
Lot of haters.
Lot of little trolls hiding behind
their little Mom's basement.
All right, so you've got Tim Burton
signed on, you've signed on,
you've got Warner Brothers,
you've got the rights together.
How did Nic Cage
enter the picture?
He reminded me of Michael Keaton.
They both had this...
weren't the handsomest guys,
but both had this tremendous,
tremendous gift as an actor.
Now when you think about it,
if somebody was just like,
"Would you like to see
a Nic Cage Superman movie,"
I'd be like "Fuck" and "Yes."
Take all my money,
'cause I wanna see what that looks like.
I was gonna play Superman,
and that fell apart,
for whatever their reasons.
And then I saw that movie
and said to myself,
"Well, that was a much more nostalgic,
traditional approach
to that character."
And I didn't wanna do that.
I was gonna turn that character
upside down along with Tim Burton.
The great thing about Nic
was that he was also--
he was a fan of the comics
but he also was a fan
of the sort of underpinnings
and the psychology of it all.
So that-- that-- that's, again,
what's what making it exciting.
He sort of understood, to me,
sort of both sides of it.
I think Tim looks at these things
slightly off-center.
You know, I mean,
if you think about Michael Keaton,
it's not the guy you would've
thought of casting as Batman.
And yet, when you saw it,
it was great, you know?
And I think when we first heard
the Nic Cage idea,
we were both intrigued
and also going,
"Well, that wasn't really the way
we were thinking of it, exactly."
I thought it was exciting that Warners
was sot of pushing the envelope
and allowing not a pretty boy
like Christopher Reeve.
I think that's what they were trying
to do is not have that squared-off jaw
like Chris Reeve or any of
the other people that have played
Superman in the past.
They wanted somebody
who was a little edgier.
Yeah, so it was your call
to get Nicolas Cage?
Yes, it was my call,
my idea, yeah.
He could create a character
that was an alien
from another planet,
so why couldn't he be
a dark alien and light?
I didn't wanna make someone
who was just... pink.
I wanted something for the street.
Because he's such an eloquent actor,
he's got a very powerful presence,
he can convey doubt and torment,
he can convey joy and happiness
and humor, and, you know,
he's an actor.
And the Oscar is awarded to...
Nicolas Cage.
I know it's not hip to say it,
but I just love acting,
and I hope that there will be
more encouragement
for alternative movies
where we can experiment
and fast-forward
into the future of acting.
When you match that with this idea
of making him a guy who
has some insecurities,
and Nic has that ability
to play so vulnerable,
It was actually
a very natural fit to his take.
Casting of Lois Lane--
um, some of the names that came up
were Courteney Cox,
- Julianne Moore...
- Courteney Cox I met with,
- Julianne Moore I met.
- And Sandra Bullock.
Sandra Bullock
was our main choice.
She would've made
a great Lois Lane.
( chuckles )
Gee, where was I?
I must not have been in that day.
Funny. She'd do it today,
but at the time, she turned us down.
- And Chris Rock as Jimmy Olsen?
- Yeah, I think...
I think we talked about Chris, yeah.
Yeah, I like Chris.
Yeah, yeah, that...
that sounds about right.
( chuckles )
Chris Rock came into work one day
on "Dogma" and was like,
"Guess who's playing Jimmy Olsen."
- And I was like, "You?"
- And he goes, "Why not me?"
I was like, "I'm just asking."
I was like, "That's awesome!"
He's going,
"Just got the call today."
I had heard
Jim Carrey as Brainiac.
Ooh.
Jim Carrey even born back then?
- Yes.
- Was he?
Schnepp: He had just played
The Riddler in "Batman Forever."
I also had sort of
Christopher Walken in mind for Brainiac.
One of the reasons why we all liked
Walken was because he's both
a very menacing cat,
but he's also very funny, right?
So there's a slightly off-centered
quality to who he is.
Your daughter's screaming.
Amy's screaming.
And Brainiac can come across,
I think,
very cold and very intellectual.
The idea of embodying him
with a guy like that
who has so much
bursting out of him...
Shh!
Kevin Spacey, I know,
he had talked about Luther,
- and that was eventually Bryan Singer.
- Yeah. Yeah, we did.
We always thought
he would be a good idea.
He'd done a lot of movies
at Warners with us.
He was definitely a favorite,
and I love him as an actor.
So it was sort of
a no-brainer, that one.
I always had
a certain thing in mind,
and talked to Kevin Spacey
about Lex Luthor.
Smith:
That is Lex Luthor.
The utter arrogance of, "Everyone
in this room is fucking beneath me."
Like, what he has to be
behind closed doors is,
"That fucking Kryptonian alien."
Like, everything is dripping with
"He's not one of us."
'Cause that's the only way that he could
possibly stand up to or over Superman.
Gods are selfish beings
who fly around in little red capes
and don't share their power
with mankind.
So I had this sort of idea of kind of
melding them in a certain way.
Strick: At some point, Brainiac
and Lex Luthor merge physically,
and Tim was, like,
kind of doubtful about that.
He said, "Isn't that gonna be
too much like that movie
with Roosevelt Grier and Ray Milland,
"The Thing with Two Heads"?
Like, that's when I read "Lex-iac."
"Wow, that's amazing!"
Burton: I remember
I had a meeting with Kevin,
and he's just-- he's very good
at doing certain imitation.
And, uh, he did a great
Christopher Walken.
Now, Christopher couldn't
be here tonight, Mike,
but he did send
the following telegram:
It's crazy.
You know, the A.F.I.,
it's an award--
it's like the Tony,
which I'm up for,
and you have a bunch of--
it's crazy.
- Well, you're saying Christopher...
- But that's who I wanted.
I mean, so, when I get something
in my mind, you know...
But I also wanted Sammy Davis Jr.
for "Beetlejuice."
Wrong.
In terms of design,
you always try to match
the design with the cast
and what you're going for and what--
you know, and I think nothing, you know,
nothing ever really got finalized
because everything else
was so, kind of, chaotic.
Well, a lot of the sort of guts
of the story is about
an evolution that happens
to our main character.
And we wanted, really,
to show that visually with the suits.
Schnepp: A lot of people
just jump to strange conclusions.
Especially, like,
we have troll wars...
And we were crucified for that.
Tim always talked about it
almost as though it was an alien
that was cradling him
and bringing him back to life
after he dies,
but it was a kind of a living organism.
Schnepp: Right.
I think what happened with that--
the Kal-El character, and he had
some kind of like robotic assistant
that then when Superman
lost his powers,
or actually when he got killed
by Doomsday,
he had this like Kryptonian
kind of regeneration suit.
Well, that has to be what it is, then.
Look at me-- I made it,
and I don't know what the hell
I'm talking about.
Atwood: That was, like,
the beginning of the regeneration suit,
as the layers went on in the beginning,
when he was in the tank.
So it's kind of the idea
of replacing
neural and circulatory things
in your body
that were kind of under the fluid
that could be laser-driven and stuff
without the kind of ecto layer
that you saw through later on it.
So the first thing we did is,
we sculpted a suit
and we cast it in silicone.
But we did it over
Nic Cage's light cast...
Kind of a biomechanical,
much more standard-looking suit.
So we did this test on Nic with this
basic, solid, silicone suit in New York,
and it was a complete disaster.
He hated it. I hated it.
Tim hated it.
Colleen hated it. I'm surprised
they didn't fire me right there.
Oh, no. It's not...
- What's doing it?
- I think this stuff is.
Schnepp:
You made a couple different things.
You made this exoskeleton
where he's kind of in this
fluid, kind of regenerating,
and then the robotic--
kind of those clear things.
Johnson: The biggest problem with it,
it's not clear enough,
it's not alive enough,
it's not iridescent enough,
and, hello, it doesn't really move
very well, so how can we fix that?
And I happen to have
a fantastic team.
I believe Lennie Macdonald,
who's a complete mad scientist
in this business and Bill Bryan as well,
teamed up on this,
knowing what was possible,
what we could do,
what we couldn't.
I first started working with Steve
at Boss Films on "Ghostbusters."
He was in charge of Slimer
and the librarian.
I decided,
you know what?
How about I just take a bunch
of the vacu-formed pieces,
go back upstairs to my loft
and start messing with them.
Vacu-forming is when you take
plastic, heat it up,
and then take suction and suck it
around a hard plaster mold
that we previously laminated
with an iridescent material.
Once that's set up,
we can then vacu-form it,
and something
interesting happened.
The iridescent qualities
become amazing, like an oil slick.
And we had done this on "The Abyss"
and it looked really cool,
so we thought,
okay, that's step one.
That's a soap bubble.
They had these vacu-formed parts,
and they were all in the places
that needed to move.
And I started overlapping them
and letting them slide
against each other.
Colleen, when she came in and, uh,
she looked at us and said,
"Hey, now, this has got
some possibilities."
And then she had us
develop it further.
Johnson: And we literally took
hundreds and hundreds of these
beetle-like iridescent shapes,
we sculpted all of these shapes--
every muscle in the body,
extending it a little bit further
than you would need.
And we came up with little clear staples
to go underneath,
and it was all held together
with clear vinyl tubing.
Johnson: Tie them together,
on Tim's recommendation
as he wanted to go
a little "Edward Scissorhands,
make it haphazard,
so we had this weird tubing
that was tying it together
in a very asymmetrical fashion.
We ran fiber optics
in all kinds of patterns,
sequenced them,
laid into the Superman suit.
You've got to know that number one optic
comes out at number one port,
number two--
through the hundreds of them,
so that you can then pattern the shapes,
just like a Las Vegas sign.
That was a layered costume,
so it was
a sculpt of musculature
with a sculpt of clear,
almost like a plexi layer over it
with etching in the plexi
where light could pass through it
and it would sort of have
a glowing quality.
Which were powered with lasers,
so it was really powerful stuff.
It looked great.
Heinrichs:
Tim was not a comics geek.
His thing was film, television,
and he was able to synthesize
a lot of what he saw
into a Tim Burton look and feel.
I've always admired the fact that
he doesn't approach things
with the same kind of reverence
that somebody who loved the comics
and loved certain things about them.
You know, every show Tim does,
he initiates the show with
sketches, character designs,
and they immediately give you a sense
of where he wants to go
and what he wants to do.
In your Tim Burton art book
from your museum show,
there's a big picture of Brainiac,
like with green flames,
and there's three characters standing.
Burton: Well, there was like a bit
Wizard of Oz-y kind of...
What about some of those images
that I saw in some of your artwork?
Like a-- he has like--
he's kind of a--
he was a supercomputer,
so he's kind of a greenish...
Yeah, I kind of, I don't know,
I had a weird mixture of, like,
that head in the ball
of "The Haunted Mansion."
Sort of like a fishbowl
kind of head kind of thing.
And there was, like...
he had a cape on
or he looked like he was human,
but then he's, like,
more of a spider.
You know,
I think I was inspired by
"The Brain That Wouldn't Die"
and there was a thing...
there was a spider creature
in "Jonny Quest" that I remember.
Weird mixture of things.
I was given a sketch
that Tim Burton did,
which I thought was cool.
Johnson:
And the sketches that Tim does,
they end up looking
a lot like that in the film.
It just was something
I had never encountered before.
And so I'm like, "Does he want me
to make this stuff look real,
or is he kidding?"
So I kind of took that sketch
and kind of made it
a little more superhero-ish.
It was still interesting.
We actually nicknamed that guy
"Edward Supermans."
How did those characters like Brainiac
come about visually for you?
You know, obviously, they're very crude,
so the thing is, is like, you know,
that's why you find people
to work with
who you know you can get something crude
and then interpret it
- to something that's real.
- Yeah.
'Cause to be honest, if things looked
exactly the way I drew them,
it wouldn't necessarily be so...
you know.
One of the concepts we were pursuing
is for Kal-El's journey,
that Jor-El provided with him
a means to survive.
And one of the main means
for his survival in this new world
was Kay.
It was to be a companion for him
throughout his life.
Tim had a brilliant idea
to have Kay start out
as almost a teddy bear.
Kal-El was a baby when
he got in the craft to come to Earth,
and as Kal-El grew in the spaceship
on his journey to Earth,
he'd have this little teddy bear,
a companion,
something to comfort him
a little bit.
And Kay had the abilities
to morph and to change
to suit his needs.
Schnepp:
There was a through-line with both
Superman and Kay.
I like the whole Kay concept.
Going from the rejuvenation suit
into basically, I guess,
the Kay character
kind of becomes his suit
for a little bit.
Atwood:
We decided that it was protective.
We didn't want
another Superman suit.
That was pretty much all I heard.
It's like, "Tim Burton, it's Superman,
and you're gonna design a suit
that is gonna replicate his powers.
I knew that there was probably an
element that he was healing inside it,
regenerating, possibly.
That kind of put this notion of
something that was maybe a bit Egyptian.
What about all the glyphs
on his suit?
Sharp: I thought the hieroglyphs
would give it a sense of age
and to make it feel alien.
And I probably completely
ripped off Ridley Scott with that.
The design I did was completely
unwieldy and impractical,
but it was always meant to be
just a leap-off point.
Carson:
We were kind of exploring a gothic,
art-deco, New York-ish
kind of a design language
on many of those.
Kind of different from the traditional
guy flying with a cape
so that it was
obvious that Kay
had melded with him
and become one with him
and just assisted
every part of his being.
Within the story,
Superman, you know, almost dies,
he has a healing bath,
he has a new suit at the end,
so it was a big deal with costumes
and studio and all that.
Here, I believe,
this one would be
after the Kay suit disengages,
and this is the reformed,
newer version.
This is the new,
darker Superman.
It feels a little more organic
than the suit.
Like, it feels a little more
exposed, in a way.
This "S" kind of broke apart
into, like...
- almost like a boomerang.
- Yeah, like weaponry.
And the logo was really important.
That logo had to break up
into elements.
Schnepp: I've seen
the silver "S," like, castings of it.
How far did you get
with that final outfit?
Atwood: We kind of knew
what the material was
and the shapes and all that,
but as far as really mechanically
making all that stuff work,
we weren't there yet.
Schnepp: Doing a good job
of sculpting it up in 3-D,
vacu-forming those.
They vacu-formed them
in clear, iridescent,
reflective colors and shiny stuff.
This was gonna have a super polished
sort of feeling to it
to show all the different definitions
of the muscles.
When you moved and flew,
it would look really cool
because black is hard to film.
So this kind of kicked back
enough light
that you could
sort of see the body
and kind of feel the movement
a little bit more.
What inspired you
for some of the designs
of Superman's outfit,
which some were super shiny
and rubbery.
What were you going for?
Well, we were kind of into
a new discovery, you know?
We were looking for something
that wasn't a leotard.
We were looking for
the definition of muscle
which was more, kind of different
than the original "Superman,"
that was more of that period
where people didn't work out.
What she was doing also,
using sculptors.
They were sculpting
this fantastic suit.
Everybody wants to know
about the suit, always.
We get e-mails--
I get e-mails all the time.
"Can you tell me about the suit?"
I've never understood the fascination.
It's a suit.
He set up a team over there like
Jose Fernandez,
was an incredible suit creator.
It's a different kind of vision
of what the Superman meant.
So in this case, you know,
he was cut.
And so his suit had to fit
and be a certain way.
So it was a combination
of Nic and sculpt.
The first motion picture
I worked on with Tim
was "Mars Attacks!"
So this was the follow-up to that.
To have that suit play a part
as the character goes through
a transformation I thought
was really unique and something
you really, I guess,
up to that point,
you really hadn't seen in anything.
Between that and the different
incarnations of the suit--
the bio suit, which a lot of people
speculated about, talked about--
I'm glad you're clearing up
a lot of those perceptions.
Two minutes.
Two minutes in the movie
inside some kind of weird
neutrino liquid bath,
you'd see this electric stuff--
That's it.
That's all you would've seen.
It wasn't him flying around
with a rainbow suit.
I know there's been stills out there
from those tests,
and the stills actually
don't do it justice at all.
Schnepp: It's fantastic. I was referring
to this footage as the holy grail.
Frey:
It is like the holy grail.
Initially, I was really struck
at how he looked in that suit.
His physique, it was different
than what we had seen before.
Obviously, he's quite
a lean fellow,
but there was a certain power
to him as well.
Obviously, they're early tests.
It's about the giddiness,
the excitement of Tim and Nic
and their passion for it
and their first exploration
of the character.
That's what always got me excited.
What did Nic say about pixie dust?
What was he saying? "Sparkle dust"?
The blue had a metallic finish to it.
That's what he meant.
But he's a car guy, so they probably
call it that in car world.
That kind of obre two-tone.
When it changes in the light,
it goes back and forth.
We started with a darker blue,
but because it was a
black suit at the end,
we ended up with a more kind of
metallic feeling
on the surface of the suit.
So we tested
a million different materials
to try to figure out
what to make it out of.
I had guys coming in from 3M
and all these places
going, "Hey, we have
this new product."
It was really exciting that way
just to see...
You know, it's like
industrial design, almost.
With Superman's iconic kind of
an "S" curl and things like that,
were you gonna go with like a bit--
like the pictures that we saw
were like obviously a test-- long hair?
When they make wigs,
they make them
- so that they can be...
- Oh, yeah. They cut it down.
But we could've made it
into a nice "S,"
we could've given it
a nice bouffant,
a big comb-over...
I mean, we had so much
at our disposal.
Of course the Superman of the '90s,
also a lot of people forget
that the Superman of the '90s
had long hair at the time.
In the comic books,
he had longer hair.
We looked at long hair, short hair,
this thing, that thing.
It's like your notes
to yourself, you know?
I always looked at Superman--
"Can we get the diapers
off of him a little bit? Ehh..."
The red underwear
on the outside--
you know, we tried all different ways
to avoid that, actually,
'cause people kind of tend to make fun
of that element on Superman,
like the old "tighty-whitey"
kind of vibe.
You know, with superhero costumes,
it's always about the crotch.
There was a suggestion
that Superman wears
basketball shorts
like the Lakers.
I don't even know where this came up,
if I'm dreaming this or...
They started mentioning, like,
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe,
the Laker outfits and doing it more
so it looks like
a basketball Laker...
I don't know.
Atwood: And you're just like,
"Really? How does that work?"
That's a horrible suggestion.
I'm glad that they didn't go with that.
It went away.
Atwood: We had capes
in all different surfaces and colors.
As the costume changed and evolved,
then the cape could also
go from light to dark
and for different purposes.
One of the things
that I tried to get Tim to do
at the time,
and we may have done it,
was to create a character
out of the cape,
so that in situations that he was in,
it became formidable.
It could take that cape
and he could throw it
and bring somebody to him,
cut their head off, whatever it is,
as a weapon that lived
and came back on him.
The thing we were gonna do,
and obviously we didn't even get--
we just had the initial thing--
was to give it
whatever that vibe was
but to make it him,
so whatever that was.
And it usually takes you a while
to organically find
what that image is.
You know, like in terms of the texture,
the costume and, you know,
all of that was just
real initial stuff.
Man: In the process
of making your film,
you found that actual moment
when Nicolas Cage was closing his eyes
in the middle of the screen test,
wasn't aware, he wasn't even
posing or looking at the camera.
Yeah, I was literally
going over the footage
and saw that flash frame,
and I was like,
"Oh, my God! What is that?"
And I went to it
and literally stepped through it
and saw the half-eyed...
like, he's in mid-blink,
and that's the picture
that went all around
the entire globe.
Bryan Singer would carry around
that picture of Nicolas Cage,
the one where he had the long hair,
and it was obviously a costume test.
People on-line
don't even understand
the beginning of the behind-the-scenes
and how things operate.
Fair enough.
Like, nowadays,
I do stuff...
If I want to practice something,
you know, or experiment,
I just do it privately
with my friends.
Those are like Halloween co--
you know, that's like kids playing,
you know,
and they didn't even know.
"Well, that's just--
that's the wig.
I combed it.
It's this and it's that."
- There's a whole bunch of...
- There are things called lighting...
No, no, no. I mean,
it's literally like showing your kids
Halloween costumes.
Back then, you didn't really
think about it. It was just for us.
Now there's nothing
that's just for you anymore.
So that's why we do it,
you know,
three miles under the earth
in a bunker
with only one camera.
What was your take on Krypton?
Well, you know,
that was a bit interesting to explore,
and I had a thing
with Brainiac involved,
and I thought was interesting.
Man: Tim had this concept
of him as a creature
once again who's able to plug in,
hitting the biomechanical theme,
who can also pass as human
in some places
and just be completely bizarre
and alien in others.
Jackson:
Tim said he felt like
Brainiac should appear
as the Grim Reaper,
and so we illustrated him
that way.
We did a quick sketch,
and Tim acted all that out.
He throws back his cloak,
and he reveals
who he is
and what he looks like, truly.
And then we see that spider-esque form
for the first time.
Did you ever interact
with anybody from I.L.M.?
No. We never saw their art.
Those worlds didn't collide, really.
Warner Brothers came to us
with the script for "Superman Lives"
I think sometime in '97.
Tim had the ability
to look at my drawings,
which were done almost entirely
with colored pencil and markers
on scraps of cardboard and paper,
and imagine how it would play
in the picture.
I kind of identified the sort of
three poles of design,
and that was the core, the humanoid,
and then the spider creature
with the holographic head
and the tongue,
and then the sort of
cobra-cloaked cobra Brainiac.
We were going to introduce
the organic, technical,
biomechanical
look and feel into Krypton.
The idea of instead of space
being depicted
as this cold,
technological place,
there were a lot of organic qualities
to what we were designing
that made you feel
that it was beautiful,
made you feel that
there was something poignant
that Clark missed out on
in his life on Earth.
My little contribution was
trying to figure out if
Krypton's a sphere,
it's a planetoid,
maybe it's split into tectonic plates
that maybe telescope up and down
or shift or are constantly moving
and reacting to the universe,
and also the Dr. Seussian
pod shapes
that maybe dwell underneath
the tectonic plates as they move.
It was fun playing with the atmosphere
and how that would work.
And, you know, obviously,
a sphere is the perfect vessel
to hold an atmosphere inside.
My particular technique at the time,
before computers,
was to take black paper and draw
with white or lighter colors
onto it,
so you're basically drawing with light
and how light affects things.
Rich Heinrich's production designer
wanted to stay true
to Tim's design sensibilities,
so we did a lot of bulbous,
spherical things.
We were playing with
some different color schemes
that weren't
always seen in film.
Let's go back and talk
about your interior art
that you did for Krypton.
Because that had
such a different tone to it.
What inspired you
with those drawings?
I think that
there's a sort of--
and this is something I've felt
on every movie I've worked on--
it kind of has to do
with jamming, like musicians.
The idea is to sort of
go beyond technique
and just let yourself drift
and see what the vibe is.
And I think
what was happening is
Tim Burton was head
of the project,
in a sense, organically.
The team that worked with him
was people like Rich Heinrichs,
but there was Bill Boes, who was part
of an entirely different team.
That part of the team was bringing in
a certain knowledge
about how to make the idea
of Tim Burton's world
function in three dimensions
in a fairly realistic world.
That's all the inspiration we needed,
was to go, "Okay.
This is what you guys are doing,
so what can we do
to kind of try to blend in?"
So I think we were all getting
an organic idea
of what a Tim Burton adaptation
of a D.C. comic might look like.
Schnepp: So
this outfit here...
Atwood:
That was a Kryptonian partygoer.
This kind of thing I saw
on the Superman suit,
like in the regeneration area
there's some kind of--
Atwood: Yeah. I tried to use
elements that tied it together
so it was sort of from pieces
of things from the world.
( Atwood speaking )
I did a lot of stuff
to get a look for Krypton,
so again I used these elements
on the ecto thing
done together as headgear
and a collar thing.
So I was just figuring out
ways I could apply the backing
into the healing suit,
the elements of that,
on the pedestrians in Krypton.
So she has the element
of the hand thing on her foot.
It's an interesting exploration.
Obviously never finalized it.
I just saw, like, yeah,
some of the early designs
had a kind of Moebius/Giger type
of biomechanical aspect to it.
Would that have ever--
I mean, who knows?
After a couple more months,
it might've turned into
"Logan's Run"-like jumpsuits.
Who knows?
I thought it might lose
the tinfoil aspect of it.
Schnepp:
Mm. Mm-hmm.
- The Jiffy-Pop...
- ( chuckles )
I always expected, like,
Marlon Brando to just
- explode into popcorn.
- ( laughs )
With Tim Burton,
we never really got far enough
to develop the complexities
about Krypton.
However,
when Krypton blew up--
hold on a second.
Just a second.
Pause for a second.
Hello?
I'm in the middle of this interview.
What do you need?
Yeah, do it.
Do it, do it.
Okay.
Hello?
Let me just take
this one thing real quick.
Everybody has heard
about the guy.
My guys know all about him.
I would love to have lunch with him,
if you could set that up.
Yeah.
How much money
did you guys raise for him?
So I could put some in there
if I wanted to? Okay.
All right, I love you.
Set this up for me.
I really appreciate it.
Okay, thanks. Bye.
- Sorry about that. Life goes on.
- No worries.
Sylvain was working primarily
on the skull ship.
He was doing
concept illustration,
beautiful pen-and-ink
and watercolor illustrations,
some done in marker.
This is one of the few times
I remember Tim Burton kind of
interjecting privately
that he wanted us
to try and design something,
like an actual vessel.
But Peters wouldn't have it.
He had a "National Geographic" cover
with an Australopithecus africanus,
you know, the Lucy thing,
and I think he pinned it
on our wall and said,
"It's a skull ship.
I want a skull ship.
Skull."
( grunts )
It obviously was a skull
that floated in space,
kind of like "Zardoz," that big face
that floats in the beginning of that.
The huge eye holes are the ports
that they look out,
and there's these little guys,
these little creatures about this big,
and in scale,
the eyes are huge.
I did some sketch models
of the skull ship
out of cardboard really quick.
That was going to be built
on Warner Brothers stage 16,
which is their biggest stage.
So introduced some of the design
elements from kind of a meld
between Giger and Burton.
That segued into
the skull ship
being sculpted by Bill Boes.
The skull ship itself was
probably about this big,
and then Rick wanted to have
all this really cool, like, tubing
and mechanical stuff
on the outside,
So him and I actually
jumped in the car,
got some parts
from the train store,
and we just started
gluing things on,
and it just sort of
took on its own identity.
Heinrichs: The extra of the skull ship
actually was an incredible sculpture.
that I believe ended up
over at Jon Peters' house.
Hey, Bill Boes,
I found the skull ship.
It's right here.
In the original concept,
Krypton blew up into
thousands of little pieces.
They all became colonies
and all had their own monsters.
All these monsters
were in the skull ship.
Right, they were called
the menagerie.
The menagerie.
And it was like a zoo.
And we had all of these monsters that
were in the back of that big skull ship
which descended into Earth,
which would've been amazing.
Johnson: We did hundreds of designs
for aliens in Brainiac's ship.
We worked for months
and months and months designing,
and got pretty excited
about puppetry,
strange hybrid blends,
digital removal of certain aspects.
Kerry Gammill,
which was a perfect choice
from his "Superman" days
as an artist for the comic,
designed hundreds of designs for us.
I spent several weeks
just drawing these things.
They put a little sign
on the design room door
that said,
"Kerry's Fortress of Solitude,"
because no one was allowed
to come in there.
And then I went even a step further.
I'm a huge Brom fan.
I thought, what can it hurt to
call up Brom and see if he's interested?
And he was.
( snaps )
There was essentially
a mad-scientist
part of an alien race
that was coming in,
and they needed all these characters
brought to life.
So they brought me on board
and set me loose to start creating.
I could put a dark sense
of humor to them,
and there were elements-- again,
this was a mad-scientist's lab--
so there was a lot
of experimentation going on.
Brainiac had gone through
and collected all these specimens,
which is why he was
coming to Earth.
There's one where it's basically
like a giant dinosaur creature
attacking Superman inside
of a spaceship-- where is that from?
I just made it up.
It was like
they just wanted us
to go crazy.
They said,
"Just draw monsters."
Jon Peters liked
the ones that I didn't like.
He would come in
and look at them,
and I would say,
"Look at this. Isn't this cool?"
And he'd go,
"I like this one here."
I think the nickname I heard
for him was "Loudmouth,"
'cause you could just
hear the bellowing
coming from all the way down the hall
whenever he showed up
with an army
of women and children.
Jon Peters came by a couple times,
and he had his own ideas?
He'd bring a little entourage of people
in the room with him,
and it was very disruptive,
and everybody kind of went,
"Oh, God, here he comes."
He'd bring these kids
into the office
who would look at our drawings,
never look at us,
and start commenting, going,
"Oh, I like that one. I hate this."
Usually I bring my kids--
because--
I have four kids--
because you get very jaded
in a studio atmosphere.
It's very controlled.
Most people are being paid by you,
so most people love everything,
nobody gives you an honest opinion.
But kids give you
a really good honest opinion.
I would be working on some of
Tim's designs some days,
and Peters might
come through the office,
and he might see that
and then say,
"We're not doing any of that."
"No, I don't want that.
I want to see muscles."
Every once in a while,
he'd come in and want to demonstrate
some new jiu-jitsu move he had learned
in front of these women,
so he would call
Rick Heinrichs in the hall
and wrestle him to the ground
in front of us.
So one day Rick comes
into the art department, he goes,
"Man, we just had a meeting
with Jon Peters,
and he-- John Dexter,
the art director, was trying
to explain something to him,
and he put me, like,
in a headlock.
Man, it hurt!"
You being the producer, you'd come in,
look at some art, and then, you know...
- Choke 'em out?
- Choke somebody out.
Well, I was more
creating an energy
of an action hero
and a world that most men
don't know anything about.
I mean,
you get both sides of it.
Sometimes he'd get somebody
in a headlock.
One time he kissed me
full on the lips.
Now, which is better?
I don't know.
I think I might've preferred
the headlock, but, you know.
Or kicked in the face,
but whatever.
I wanted what it's like
to break your nose--
I've been in 500 fights--
to break your hands,
to bleed, to taste
someone else's blood...
I wanted that in these movies.
It's shooting fish in a barrel.
We take a paycheck from his studio.
Of course he can humiliate us.
I mean, that's easy, you know?
I'd like to see him wrestle a shark.
( both laugh )
I remember that Jon--
at the time, he had three
separate houses up Benedict Canyon
that he was renovating.
Tim and were always driving up there,
getting sort of uptight,
'cause you could
never quite predict
what it was going to be this time--
it was always something.
And then Tim and I got into a conflict
with Lorenzo di Bonaventura.
I'd been told that Terry Semel
had never read the script
and he finally did,
and he said,
"What is this? I hate this."
I was also told
that Warners was changing
its strategy in terms of the slate,
and they didn't want to swing
for the fences anymore.
They'd gotten burned on--
oh, I guess on "Batman Forever," maybe.
- Schnepp: "Batman & Robin."
- "Batman & Robin."
And Tim has always been upset
about the fact that
the "Superman" project was doomed
by Joel Schumacher,
who fucked up
Tim's own franchise
and then fucked up
Tim's Superman movie.
And one day, Tim said,
"Can you come over?"
This is three or four months
into the process.
and I kinda said,
"What's going on?"
And he started
in this sheepish way to say,
"Well, you know, the Warners brass
and Lorenzo and Terry Semel..."
And I kind of interrupted him.
I saw where it was going.
I said, "Tim, you're firing me."
And he said, "Well, they told me to."
This is where it gets into that
sort of gray area of studio,
the black-hole development.
It's the hardest thing to describe,
but you go through it almost every time.
Why, I don't know.
It's just that I've been involved in
so many scripts where you're fixing it,
but you're basically
just smothering the life out of it.
And when you go down that track,
it's not a good one,
but it happens
a lot of the time.
You know, he told me that
they were gonna
hire somebody else,
which was Dan Gilroy, I think.
The first meeting was
at Jon Peters' house up in Bel Air,
and we started talking
about the current script,
and it was the idea
of going deeper with the characters
and working on the action,
and just-- it became a sense that
the script wasn't where they wanted it.
And the next day,
I was at Warner Brothers,
going to meet with Tim
at the production office,
and it became a daily,
for the next year,
it became a seven-day-a-week job.
And I think what was brilliant
about what Tim did
and what he wanted to explore
is to take
a classic superhero character
who is beyond emotional turmoil.
What Tim latched onto was,
"Wait a minute. He's an outsider."
Because Superman is unique.
He's not of the world.
Batman's of the world.
Spider-Man's of the world.
All of the X-Men are of the world.
They're mutants of the world.
It was the emotional angst
of somebody realizing
that they are not of us.
I think people who are drawn to fantasy
very much are drawn to fantasy
because it's literally an escape from
the bullshit nightmare societal damage
that gets created
by growing up.
In the later draft that I have,
Kay turns into Jor-El.
Gilroy: Our Kay, I think,
went much farther in the sense
of saying that somehow there was
a Kryptonian technology
that imbued
the essence of Jor-El,
that went beyond--
that went beyond just a projection.
I was playing
with looking at owls
as a kind of a touchstone.
Sort of like Brainiac was cobra,
I felt like Kay was owl
and was designed to
not only sort of
nurture and envelop Superman
when he was a baby,
but to teach him,
to train him, to befriend him.
And literally,
visually,
after Superman is killed
by Doomsday,
Kay resurrects him
and becomes the new costume.
I always felt that having Kay gave us
a more physical presence of Jor-El.
Really, the focus was on
Nic's character on Superman
and Clark and that part
of the story.
( Cage speaking )
( Burton speaking )
( Burton laughs )
It starts off with Clark Kent as a guy
who works at the newspaper,
but he had an apartment,
and inside his apartment
he had a separate place where it was
sort of his changing room,
his little man-cave,
and I remember on the wall
he had a tremendous number
of newspaper articles.
You could tell there'd been
a lot of research
that he'd done
trying to figure out
what might have caused
his condition,
that maybe this was some sort
of medical condition that he had.
So, early on,
when Lex, through Lexcorp,
uncovers the fragment of spaceship
near the Clark family farm,
the second that Clark Kent
realizes that he's an alien,
it is utterly, utterly devastating
emotionally to him.
And these are things
that dominated
the conversations
that I would have with Tim.
Both Tim and Nic
had this idea of, like--
Clark Kent was going to be
a bigger freak than Superman, almost.
Like, Clark Kent
would be the alien.
( Cage speaking )
( Atwood speaking )
( all laugh )
( Burton speaks )
Yeah, I guess the equivalent
of Clark Kent now would be
those guys, like,
in Silicon Valley,
like those kind of brainy guys
that are sort of--
who knows what
their secret life is?
( Cage speaking )
( Burton speaking )
It's a love story,
and we tried to make it
as simple as that.
But he did have a dark side,
like many men do.
On the other hand,
he was extremely vulnerable
because he really didn't have anybody
and he was alone.
She gave him the strength
of feeling,
you know, that he was
who he was
and that she loved him anyhow.
The relationship we established
early on was stalled.
He had this deep concern--
"What if we have a baby?
What if this baby punches
his way out of you, like 'Alien'?
What if the baby kills you?"
He doesn't share it,
but you can tell this is the dilemma.
di Bonaventura: He was going
to get engaged to Lois,
and he was sitting
in a restaurant
and literally pumping
his leg like this, you know?
And the water
on everybody's table was shaking.
He's so anxiety-ridden
that he leaves the restaurant--
it's, I think-- it was
on top of a building--
and then flew around the building,
like, 30 times,
trying to burn off steam.
He doesn't change his suit.
He doesn't look
for a phone booth or anything.
He just burns out of his suit.
He just takes off,
and that in itself is enough
to just shred the clothes.
Tim wanted more of a visceral punch
that you saw
in those Max Fleischer cartoons,
which is sort of an adaptation
of what Siegel and Shuster's
original "Superman" was.
That was our Kal-El.
That was our "Superman."
He's not somebody who can fly--
Tim said he didn't like
the idea of-- of--
of the sort of magical flying,
of just floating in space,
and so he said, "I want to ground it
and tie it to physics.
And so if he jumps
three miles in the air,
he comes right back down
like a bullet."
The first thing I'd done
for that was to do
almost a Superman parkour sequence
on a grand scale,
so it shows Superman
leaping across the city.
It might take him
five or six leaps,
but he makes each leap
being the equivalent
of two miles or three miles.
I'm much more interested in, like,
somebody flying through the clouds
and, you know, feeling the texture
of that on their face.
For me,
it was very important--
was the idea of
whatever was going on,
the feeling of
what it would feel like
to be like that kind of a character.
So I was trying to get more
into the sort of visceral feel of it,
uh, you know,
no matter what other bullshit
was going on.
How do you make flying cool
and also affordable?
Man:
I.L.M. got involved.
They were going to do
the visuals on the movie.
So they ended up coming down
and we did some tests
of just shooting this stuff
and then figuring out how
the cape was gonna fly.
Atwood:
We did a lot of testing with that,
and I think, you know,
for the time,
the guys came up
with some really great stuff.
It was pretty exciting.
It was still early in the process,
and we had some evolution
to be done to the techniques
that Tim was going for,
but we were gonna get there.
Then watching Nic Cage
in an outfit land
was kind of like, "Whoa.
There's Superman, the Nic Cage version."
That moment I remember
really acutely, 'cause it really--
It was like, "Whoa, oh.
We really are doing this.
You know, here we are."
There was lot of, like,
"at-odds"
between the studio,
the producers, and ourselves.
We were just like,
"Well--"
You know, there was
a push to have, like,
Superman having a lot of,
like, kung-fu fights.
It's like, well, he's not going to get
into a kung-fu fight
with a bunch of ninjas.
And, you know, no--
( grumbles )
There's this whole sequence
of Luthor's henchmen polluting
the waterways of Metropolis,
and Superman at some point
has to contend with
a group of ninjas.
( music playing )
I think they're there
as sort of, um...
( music playing )
- I'm gonna stop. Can we go back?
- Yeah.
I'm just trying to think
what they were there for.
- I don't remember.
- They had just seen "The Matrix,"
and they were like,
"We won!"
I really don't remember.
"You're the one!"
Superman's like, "I'm not Neo."
I think I thought
it was just absurd.
( music playing )
We went scouting
when we decided on
where we were going to shoot
a lot of the exteriors.
Most of it's gonna be done
on stage, obviously.
And we ended up going to Pittsburgh,
and Tim fell in love with it.
Burton: Pittsburgh--
I don't know-- just had
an interesting feel to some of it
and felt kind of right.
Man: A lot of our ideas
were all about getting these locations
and expanding them,
extending the sets
with visual effects.
There's the P.P.G. building
that was going to be
Lex Luthor's place.
You know, his lair.
Burton:
Lex himself was going to appear
almost at one
with his office that way.
Carson: We wanted similar proportions
to the "Daily Planet,"
so it was kind of the counterpart--
more gothic, more weighty,
slightly more villainous.
- What about Perry White's office?
- Instead of it being
the cliche newspaper office,
where it's basically the floor
surrounded with
the editors' offices,
we wanted Perry himself
also to have
a kind of vaunted sense
of himself.
My last interaction or crossover
with Superman
was when
we were making "Dogma."
In 1998,
we were in Pittsburgh,
and we went to use a building
for our MovieCorp.
They were like, "You can't use that.
That building's being held."
And I was like, "For what?"
And they're like,
"That's going to be Lexcorp
for the Tim Burton
'Superman' movie."
And I was like,
"Get out of here."
I knew Tim Burton loved kaiju
and Godzilla stuff.
Doomsday can be our kaiju,
our Hulk-plus thing.
So what if this was a thing,
an organism that destroys,
but it propels
its inanimate matter
with an engine of energy?
So this rock creature punches you
with laser rocket power
driving the punch,
and it's sharp,
then maybe I kind of create
a power source.
Is is some sort of energy core
in the middle of it?
Maybe its exoskeleton?
Let's also take it out of human anatomy
and give it a second pair of arms.
And Doomsday was supposed
to be cut in half
but some big ventilation fan
or something under there,
and so we were doing some designs
where he's cut into two pieces,
but then they sort of form
two Doomsdays
and then they sort of meld
back into another one.
In the comic book,
he was more of a big, muscular thing
with kind of bony protrusions,
and I tried to get a little of that
into the concept,
but they really just wanted
a big monster.
I don't know what stuck.
I mean, we were
all over the place.
So many hundreds
of designs done.
I was reacting
to what Tim put down initially.
He gave me a sketch
of a creature that had multiple--
its entire body was covered
with faces and heads,
And he explained
that during the fight,
some of these faces and heads
would morph and change
into people that Kal-El,
that Superman, knew personally.
It would be somewhat unsettling
to be fighting a creature,
and all of a sudden you see
Lois Lane's face there
or you see Perry White's face there.
The one thing I was really interested
in seeing the designs develop
was the Superman-Doomsday
battle in the subway.
I think it was underground.
A lot of it happened underground.
And just the real feeling of
power and force
and strength and destruction.
The concept designs for that scene
were quite striking.
The fight with Doomsday
was chilling,
because you had this guy
who you'd been tracking
for the first 50 pages
of the movie,
and you knew emotionally
he was dead.
He was emotionally devastated.
You could see, as the fight
was going on, that he was losing.
And you could see
that it was just all
being taken away from him.
And again, it goes
to this emotional power
that comes from this decision,
this primal decision that Tim makes
to want to go this route.
And I remember writing
the death scene,
and as he was dying, I remember
a part of me was thinking,
"There's a part of him
that wants to die.
There's a part of him
that wants to let go."
And I'll tell you something else
that's interesting--
Princess Di died
right while I was writing
that sequence.
And Jon Peters called me and said,
"You've got to come over to the house."
I said,
"Just copy what you see on TV
and write it into the script."
I wanted the grandness
of a world weeping.
Thompson: We were watching
the processionals and the funeral,
and that very much dictated
how we saw the death of Superman.
Heinrichs:
We had almost a severe fascist
or constructivist approach
to the Superman tomb.
In the scene that takes place,
it was originally going to be
at the Fortress of Solitude.
At the time the plug was pulled,
we were considering
it being in Superman's tomb,
but this was
the resuscitation of Superman.
What kind of brought
"Superman" down?
I don't think
there's any one reason.
As always, there's usually
a combination of reasons,
and everybody will have
a slightly different perspective.
As somebody inside,
"Superman" got caught in an unfortunate
moment in time at Warner Brothers.
So when you're
working on this script,
people are checking
on almost a daily basis.
It was a studio movie.
It was a huge budget.
I think it had a release date.
Before we handed in our first drafts,
nobody was talking about money
in terms of the budget.
It was just like,
"We're gonna-- this is a big movie.
We're going to write this big."
I got a phone call that Warner Brothers
had run a budget.
It was through the roof.
It would've been 200 for the movie,
another 100... it would've been
a $300-million investment.
The budget was not
an insignificant budget.
It was a really large budget.
There was a period of four weeks
where it was like,
"We've got to retool this again
and make this smaller.
It's too expensive.
We have to start cutting things."
And these big, huge
action sequences that
before had a blank check
attached to them,
suddenly-- it was like,
14 buildings don't go down.
We're going to keep it inside
the 5th floor of this one building.
And the Fortress of Solitude
gets jettisoned.
Everything goes into the tomb.
And it was very much
always in flux.
Development hell doesn't happen
with no-name directors.
It happens only
with famous directors
that a studio doesn't dare
break up with.
And that's how you end up for two years
just polishing a turd
until finally somebody walks away
at great cost.
We had several films
fail right around it
or under-perform
right around it.
So suddenly, the economic pressure
on all of us was very significant.
In the conference room
at Warner Brothers,
there's a big board,
and it's literally the size of a wall,
and it has their entire
release slate for the year,
including all the other films
coming out that weekend.
So it's broken up by weekend.
Warner Brothers got on one
of the all-time terrible rolls.
Bob Daley and Terry Semel
were in charge of the studio
and had a tremendous run.
These are very talented people.
But at this point,
for some reason,
things were misfiring.
And you could just see.
It was just like
every week,
the horserace was happening
and their horse
was coming in last.
Big movies.
So as we're coming in to discuss
at the conference table
our incredibly large-budget film
with a Tim Burton take,
which is deconstructionist
and unusual and unique,
what's going on around us
is you were looking
at the board and going--
you can just see the bombs
as they were going off.
Every time I'd come
in the conference room,
another executive had been fired.
And, as you know,
from a human nature standpoint,
when money starts getting tight
and people have to make big decisions,
safety becomes the big thing.
The risk that you can take
when you're feeling confident
is very different than when
you're feeling
a little bit on your heels.
And we were on our heels
at that moment.
We were all interested
in getting the script better,
the filmmakers were too,
and it was still in process.
Lorenzo's utterly right.
It's like, we need to work on it,
we needed to hone it, we needed
to make it better all the time.
But there was enough there that
you could see what it was going to be.
Dan Gilroy gave it
some real shape.
And I kind of liked what he did.
The studio didn't like it.
And there was nothing-- you never
felt you were on solid ground
when you were going in
to talk about the script,
because there was always
the sense that it was--
It wasn't even
a blinking green light.
It was a green light.
They were moving ahead.
I think the day before it shut down,
I think Peters' assistant
came by the art department
and said he needed the skull ship model
for something-- for a meeting.
And so we all
thought it was strange
because they had
just finished that model.
And so he took that model
that evening.
That was at the end of the day.
I think the very next day, we got word
that the production was shut down.
We built this test suit just for
one of the people
that worked at my studio,
and by the time we got so excited
that we were ready to explode,
spontaneously combust,
'cause we thought we'd come up
with exactly what Tim wants
and something
pretty damned unique,
we got the call
that the show was off.
Everything had finally come together,
and we were ready to go
to the next step.
Actually, the day
of the camera test
was the day that they came and told us
that the movie was off.
So we only had elements
of that costume to camera-test
to make sure it was all
visually strong.
So we never got to make
the whole thing.
It's the one costume I've never
gotten to really make
that I always thought
would've been, like, amazing.
We were literally
three weeks before production.
We were ready to go.
We were full-amped and ready to roll.
It was like getting
run over by a car.
That afternoon,
they called us all in,
and I remember
Tim and I and Jon went in,
and we sat with Bob
and Terry and Lorenzo,
and it was the
"Look, we're talking about this
and we're talking about that,
and the studio cannot sustain
this film at this point,"
and they pulled the plug.
Peters:
Terry Semel came up.
We did a show-and-tell.
Showed him everything
that we had--
the script, the storyboards,
all the stuff--
and he was my closest friend,
and he took me
in the room with Tim,
and he said,
"We're gonna cancel the movie.
We're gonna shut it down."
So we were being asked
to spend a lot of money
at a time where
we were a bit ahead,
or the script was a bit behind
where we were spending the money,
and then we had this overall pressure
going on within the corporation.
And I think it's really
three different sort of things
were happening at the same time.
I don't know that you can say,
"That's the one," but they were.
And, you know,
it is a financial reality
when you're inside a company.
When they're worried
about their results,
they look at the risk factor
in a different way.
I was angry,
frustrated.
I felt betrayed,
but it was their call.
What would you say
are the top three reasons
they pulled the plug,
from their perspective?
Budget, Nicolas Cage,
and Tim Burton.
I think they didn't
totally believe that Tim
could make a "Superman"
that would be commercial.
People were scared of this movie,
just like they were scared of "Batman."
Whether it was
they were still sort of--
still freaked out about my
"Batman Returns" or whatever
or "Mars Attacks!,"
whatever the dynamic was,
and I've had this happen
from the beginning,
is, like, they,
"Okay, yeah, do it,"
but then they're always slightly
worried about you in some way.
Highly creative people
have a hard time
getting their movies made.
Full stop.
That's all it is.
Because they bring stuff
that blows everyone away.
and as much as they claim
they want original,
they're terrified of it.
That's what happens.
So you don't see those movies
because they scare everybody
up the chain of command.
You know, like, when you
have a transplanted organ,
the body either rejects
the organ or not,
you have to have somebody in the body
that says, "No, I want that liver."
And usually
with these dangerous movies,
people are kind of going,
"I don't know."
And Jon is a tremendous,
passionate believer
and proponent
of the franchise,
and he fought like hell
for this movie.
Oh, I went to Terry Semel
and threatened him
with throwing him
out his window.
I mean, I was like,
"You can't do this to me.
I've worked on this
for too many years.
We're ready to go.
We're cast.
We have one of the great directors
who just made
a billion-dollar
franchise for you.
Roll the dice, man.
Roll the dice."
Nope.
So that year you were working
on "Superman Lives,"
how much money was spent?
I think it was somewhere close
to between 10 and 12 million,
and then I don't know
if there was any payoff to Tim
or any payoff to Nic Cage
or anything,
'cause I don't know
if they had a pay-or-play deal.
Tim was completely devastated.
He ran out.
He wouldn't talk to me
or anybody for a week.
A week-- a month.
Where the studio was,
Jon, the studio, me--
you know, the combination
just was, you know.
But it is pain--
I have to say, it is painful
to work so long on something,
you know.
Once that was over with,
and I couldn't even get Tim on the phone
to try to figure a way
to get it going again--
'cause I wasn't going to give up on it
until I got it made--
Will Smith said yes to
"Wild Wild West,"
and we went off
and began shooting that movie.
That was another big film
that Warner Brothers was developing.
A quite expensive film.
and we kind of got a sense like,
"Okay, we're gonna now
focus on that."
They actually mentioned in the room
while they were pulling the plug
that the funds were going to be
going over to "Wild Wild West."
And, you know,
that is its own story.
- Oh, that is a whole other documentary.
- Yeah.
I went to a movie theater
years later
to see a movie called
"The Wild Wild West."
All of a sudden,
the Kenneth Branagh character
shows up, like,
in this gigantic metal
walking spider, this monster spider,
bigger than fuck.
I was so caught up with this spider,
the Thanagarian snare beast,
that we did a comedic version
with "Wild Wild West,"
and that's where the spider came in.
I remember Jon Peters' name
in the credits.
I was like, "Goddamn it.
That motherfucker finally got
his fucking spider."
Now when I go to conventions
and I show people,
I'm actually doing the opposite
of Bryan Singer.
I'm doing like,
"Hey, come here a minute,"
and I show some fan who's like,
"Nic Cage is stupid!
He would've been horrible
in that movie!"
"Check this out."
"Whoa, that's not bad."
Cage: You know,
that character is such a bull's-eye
that you have to hit.
He's almost--
he's one of the most
precious icons of our country.
And the fact
that Tim and I
were pretty far down the road
designing it--
and I know that with Tim
and where I was going to go,
we would've done something
really special--
at least it's out there in the ether
that that could have happened,
but it doesn't have to--
we don't have to make the movie.
It's still interesting to people.
You know, from that perspective,
it was a big disappointment,
because I think
he would've really stretched
in a way he hadn't yet,
and maybe hasn't since.
I don't know.
He hasn't made that movie.
When "Superman Lives" ended,
obviously it was
a very dark time, you know,
to have something that-- for everyone,
everyone that worked on it.
You know,
it's a horrible thing
to be working
creatively on something
and then have it just
pulled from your life.
It's just amazing to me
to look back that way
and look at what's going on now
with these kind of movies
and wonder what that would've been then
and what it could've become.
It's just something
I think people should know--
that they're looking
at a process, not a product.
The ultimate product
would've been an amazing film.
I don't know how it couldn't been
at least received very interestingly
because it's a movie
I'd still like to see.
And plus I would've been able to do
a lot of cool monsters in it.
That was a big part
of who I am today.
That was the moment--
like, going out there
and telling that story
over and over again.
Because of "Superman Lives,"
that was when I realized
my true talent, I think.
It obviously wasn't writing
"Superman,"
it was talking
about writing "Superman."
That was where
the real money was, I guess.
I think it would've definitely
established the fact
that you can
make a tough guy
have a great deal
of insecurity.
It might not have been
the comic book "Superman"
or the television "Superman"
or Dick Donner's "Superman,"
but Tim Burton's "Superman"
would've been
something quite unique
and probably something
we'd still be talking about, you know.
Well, we are talking
about it anyway.
It didn't even get made
and we're talking about it.
Tim is really, I've got to be honest,
I think one of the only people
who could really do it justice,
because he understands it.
He's lived it.
And he, uh--
man, he would've fucking
knocked it out of the park.
I think it would've either been
laughed off the screen
or a big hit.
I think Tim Burton would've made a movie
I would've been proud of.
Would it have done these kind of numbers
that we needed to do?
Maybe not.
If we would've been able
to strip through all of the chaos,
I think we could've had
an interesting movie,
'cause it would've had
some cool imagery
and let Superman be Superman
and then also experience
what it's like to be hidden
and to be that character.
I mean, all those things were--
that was the core essence
of what we were
trying to do.
So any final thoughts
on "Superman Lives"?
If you think back about it now,
how do you feel about it?
Why are you trying
to depress me so much today?
Anybody got any cyanide
or anything I can take?
Visit me when I'm about 90,
and I'll be here...
( old man's voice )
Still gonna make it.
Gonna make it.
