Summer 1988
sorry for all the letters.
This is also about
your wife's adultery.
You may think this is
just some sort of prank.
So i have decided to write
this one last time.
This isn't a trick or a joke.
A man visits your wife at night,
when you go
on all-night fishing trips.
Hello.
You're home early today.
The door's open.
I'm home.
I'm packing your lunch.
You're going fishing tonight, right?
What'll you be fishing for?
Sea bass and black sea bream.
Then it's sashimi tomorrow.
Recently the
landlady has been ill.
It'll be cold tonight.
Take an overcoat.
...especially when
you go fishing.
What time will you be home?
Same as always.
Good luck.
- See you.
- Take care.
Leaving already,
mr. Yamashita?
They're just starting to bite.
You can have this.
Are you sure?
Say hello to everyone.
Take care.
See you.
Going back already?
- Shall i drive you?
- No thanks.
- Coming next week, too?
- Yes.
- Good bye.
- See you.
Korea prepares for the olympics
he drives a white sedan.
You killed her!
Murder! Help!
Help!
My name is takuro yamashita.
I live in wakaba, tama ward.
I just killed my wife.
This is the weapon i used.
Come inside.
Call homicide.
This way.
Homicide?
A man has just turned himself in.
Yes, please.
Eight years later
make sure you don't break any rules
while you're on parole.
And don't make any trouble
for rev. Nakajima, your parole officer.
Even if you see trouble occurring around you,
don't let yourself be drawn into it.
I hope you'll spend your two years
on parole without any lapses.
My car's in the parking lot.
You forgot this.
I put some oxygen in.
It should last all day.
What is it?
It's yamashita's pet eel.
Pet eel?
He kept it in a pond
inside the prison.
Actually, pets are forbidden
but we pretended it was ours.
But why an eel?
He listens to what i say.
He listens?
He doesn't say
what i don't want to hear.
The eel
where is your wife buried?
I don't know.
Is that so...
- tastes good?
- Yes.
This is my temple.
You'll have to come here
and report to me occasionally.
We can just talk,
that's all.
Will you come in?
My eel doesn't look so good.
Let's take a walk.
I'll show you that shop you asked about.
Can't you walk alongside me?
It's an 8 year habit.
Reverend nakajima!
Another funeral?
Time to rake in more cash, huh?
No.
We're just out walking.
He's an old student
who's visiting me.
This is mr. Takada.
This is mr. Yamashita.
I'm showing him the
sights of sawara.
Sawara is as empty
as the sahara.
- What's that?
- It's an eel.
It's a whopper!
At least a kilo.
You going to gril lit?
He's much too fond of it.
Shall we continue?
Where are you going?
There's nothing out that way.
I'll show him the old barber shop.
He's thinking of starting up.
Not that old place?
I agree. But he saw the photos
and liked the place.
Hello.
Mr. Yamashita,
come back here.
- What an odd guy.
- You might say that.
Are you sure about this?
Yamashita.
This is your bank book.
I got it from your brother.
He received 4 million yen
when your mother died.
He spent a million on the funeral.
This is what's left.
Yes.
Plus the 80,00 yen
you earned while in prison.
It's 3.8 million yen in total.
Take it.
It's a lot of money.
Prices have risen in
the past eight years.
Use it wisely.
Hello, takada.
What are you doing?
I like this place.
How about you?
Better than the prison pond.
What did you say?
I agree!
He certainly is different,
isn't he?
He thinks he did nothing wrong?
Well, he never admitted as much.
But that's apparently what he believes.
He doesn't regret what he did?
Thank you for the bath.
Be careful!
Let me introduce you to my wife.
I'm misako.
Nice to meet you.
I'll wash your things.
No, thank you.
I can do it myself.
Excuse me going to bed early.
Good night.
Sorry about this.
It won't be easy.
What's going on here?
You opening up shop?
What's he up to?
Apparently he's
opening a barbershop.
You're kidding!
He's too bloody unsociable.
How do you like it here?
What are you fishing for?
Nothing in particular.
What if a customer comes?
I can see from here.
Don't i look like a customer?
Talk to that eel,
do you?
Make you laugh,
does he?
I happened to catch it
and i'm just keeping it.
We should go
eel-hunting together.
That's downright unusual.
A woman here all by herself.
What's up?
Don't stand out there.
Come on in.
I'm going to get some food for my eel.
Takada knows a good place.
Does he?
While you're on parole...
don't let yourself be drawn
into any kind of trouble.
How'd it go?
I'm first in line.
Find any good eel food?
What are you on about?
Anything wrong?
- Will you come with me?
- What for?
It's something i saw.
You're not a child.
You should know better.
Why didn't you
report it immediately?
I just wanted someone
to be with me.
Was there anything in her purse?
Sleeping pills and lipstick.
Did you open her purse?
I didn't touch it.
Who gives a damn?
Nothing was stolen, right?
Come on,
we reported it!
I have to cover
all possibilities.
What for?
Is that so?
Good.
She'll live.
It's good she was found quickly.
They pumped her stomach.
We'll be in touch
if there's anything else.
I'll go to the hospital.
What a bummer.
It wasn't a murder.
Watch your mouth!
No pat on the back
for the good citizens?
Don't be a smart ass.
Come on, i'll show you
how to use the spear.
What spear?
The eel spear i was
telling you about.
Damn.
These days hardly
anyone spears eels anymore.
Only me in these parts.
Got 'in!
Pull it off.
Did you know that woman
who tried to kill herself?
No,
but she resembled someone...
really? Who?
My wife.
We're separated.
Right!
Game to try your luck?
What?
The spear.
I'll hold the light,
you spear.
There's one.
Right over there.
There you go.
What's wrong?
What was that for?
I don't feel
comfortable doing it.
I am writing to tell
you that your wife
i wanted to ask you a favor.
I was going to come tomorrow,
but the sooner the better.
A favor?
Yes. It's about
that miss hattori.
Miss hattori?
I'm sorry for all the trouble.
The policeman said
you saved my life.
May we come in?
Please.
Please accept this,
along with my apologies.
Actually, i should thank you, not apologize.
You saved my life.
Thank you very much.
Is this the favor?
She's looking for work in town,
so i thought of your place.
Here?
She stayed a few weeks with us
while she thought things over.
But she doesn't want
to return to tokyo.
Better she works
than stays idle.
Naturally she'll be
staying at the temple.
I'm sure it will work out.
You've no objection?
No objections.
But i don't...
good morning.
Catch anything?
The door's open.
Okay.
- Shall i wash the towels?
- Towels?
The used ones.
We're running low.
Towels are washed on tuesdays.
But it's such a nice day.
It's out back, right?
I worked for a barber as a kid.
I even did shampoos.
Anything else to wash?
Don't wash anything.
But we have very few clean ones.
And few customers,
too.
Are you sure?
I couldn't find a vase.
I don't like flowers.
No flowers in the shop?
I didn't say that.
What made you do it?
I shouldn't have asked.
I fell in love with
the wrong person.
I started to think,
what's the point in living?
I probably deserved it.
Punishment for what i'd done.
Good morning.
Hello there.
Not here for a haircut.
What do you make of this?
You don't like spears,
right?
This won't hurt the eels.
Leave it out overnight and pull it up
when there's something init.
Just leave 'em out overnight.
The tough part's
choosing the right spot.
Give it a try?
Slowly and quietly.
You didn't divorce your wife.
She died, didn't she?
I lost my wife,
too. I can tell.
Tie it tightly or lose it.
Am i right?
I've had my fill of women.
One month later
today's gonna be sunny!
What are you up to?
Mr. Yamashita said i could borrow this
when he's closed.
Think you can call
up a ufo with that?
They did it in america,
in colorado.
Come on in.
It's an hour's wait.
Here you are.
Settled in,
haven't you?
Some over here,
please.
- Have some potato.
- Thank you.
More than just settled in.
He couldn't do without her.
Why's that?
Why's that?
Look around you.
You like kids,
do you yamashita?
Never seen you so friendly.
Can you give this to emi?
It's a concert ticket.
She'll be by to pick it up.
Playing hooky again?
No, i'm in the
middle of a marathon.
Joji, take along some
fried sweet potatoes.
You two seem to
be getting along.
Cut it out.
Don't get so upset.
I don't want any rumors.
Please,
i'll give you a shampoo.
Too late,
word's already out.
Everyone's talking about you two.
You didn't know?
I'll go make lunch.
I'm sorry for any trouble.
Trouble?
You know,
the rumors.
- Involved with a would-be suicide.
- Get me the sauce.
I've been meaning to ask you.
Why do you keep that eel?
An eel suits me.
I'll do them.
That's ok.
What'll you do if aliens come?
I want to make
friends with them.
They're constantly watching us.
They only come to those
who really want to meet them.
Aren't you really just afraid
of making friends with people?
You're afraid of dealing
with people, right?
Just like you,
right?
You talk to your eel
because you don't like people, right?
I write to you
again to inform...
where's the garbage
you wanted removed?
Excuse me?
I asked them to come.
That garbage out back.
It's an eyesore.
- Back of the building?
- Yes.
Do you know him?
What happened?
I cut myself earlier.
It's really nothing.
Come inside.
Hi there.
What happened?
Sorry,
we're closed today.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You should see a doctor.
A doctor?
- Does it hurt?
- No.
Hang on tight.
You'll fall off.
Hold on tighter!
Hold your wife's hand.
No anesthetic?
Not for a scratch like this.
Keiko's all right. Nothing serious.
It only took two stitches.
She was impressed with you.
She seemed awfully pleased.
She did?
Young people!
Come here.
You say he was in
prison with you?
He's a garbage man
so we'll see a lot of each other.
You're afraid people will find
out about your past?
About keiko...
there's nothing between us.
I know that.
Is it bad to have such rumors
about a guy on parole?
No, i'm more concerned
about her feelings.
Has she said anything?
She wants to leave.
What?
Quit working for me?
No, she wants to leave here
and live at your place.
But she's reluctant to
bring it up with you.
What a marvelous device!
That'll never attract ufos.
What a fool!
What makes you think so?
One may come.
Ufos don't exist.
Tv stations invented
them to boost ratings
at his age he
should know better.
I thought i'd find you here.
I want to see his ufo.
Like a festival,
isn't it?
Masaki really believes
a ufo will come.
Why do you want to stay with me?
Because i've never met
anyone like you before.
When i cut myself...
no one's ever taken care of me before.
Not like that.
Going fishing tonight?
I'll bring you some food.
A boxed dinner?
I'll be waiting for you
at the sakura bridge.
Here it is.
- Any eels?
- Probably.
Just a minute.
Two big ones.
They've started coming back.
Homing eels taste best,
so they say.
They've fattened up
for their long journey.
They're feasting
on crabs and shrimp.
That's masaki's house over there.
The ufo guy.
Isn't that keiko?
A little rendezvous, huh?
No, not really.
So what's she doing there?
Don't stop the boat.
You sure?
That'll be 2,
000 yen.
Thank you.
Please come again.
Welcome.
I've been looking for you.
Can i help you,
sir?
I'm a friend of keiko's.
Eiji dojima.
Could you excuse us?
How are you,
mom?
The hospital was dreadful.
- Everyone is completely crazy.
- Really?
I like akita,
but not the hospital.
Mom, wait.
You'll get lost again.
Is dojima still with his wife?
He says he'll divorce her.
Now's a bad time for loan sharks.
I can help him out with a little cash.
Don't ever say that to him!
Lt'll make things worse.
In one gulp,
great!
I can't do much for you...
except 10 or 20 million yen.
Really?
That'd sure help.
The carmen of akita.
That's what they called me.
Mom,
that's enough.
Mother, stop!
About dojima.
The one who came today.
He wants a favor from mother.
Your mother?
She's in a hospital in tokyo.
What's wrong with her?
It's a mental thing.
I'll bring you
another lunch box.
You better go home.
Do you know about yamashita?
She's there again.
What'll you do?
'I'll be free tomorrow.'
'Be at the floodgate
at three o'clock tomorrow.'
'This is a warning.'
'You aren't reflecting on your
conduct and that's bad.'
'You're a murderer too,
but you're chasing that girl.'
'You haven't even
visited your wife's grave.'
'Who do you think you are? '
'Every day i sit before the altar,
copying sutras,'
'and praying for my dead wife
and mother-in-law.'
Takasaki quit the garbage company
and went back home.
No.
That's impossible.
His parole officer
called to tell me.
He knew you two
corresponded a few times.
He said it was a good thing,
it encouraged him to fit back in.
Parole officers know everything.
I'm no different to
what i was in prison...
hi, there.
Where have you been?
I had something to do.
Three customers came.
They'll be back.
Have you eaten?
I made some dinner.
I'll warm it up now.
I don't want anything.
You don't like stew?
You misunderstand.
Misunderstand what?
About me.
I'm not the man you think i am.
Because you were in prison?
You knew?
Who told you?
That garbage man
who came by the other day.
Do you know why i was in prison?
I killed my wife.
That was a lie,
about us being divorced.
I stabbed her to death.
I'm a murderer.
I tried to forget,
but these hands can't.
The blade slashing her flesh...
stabbing deep into her body.
How could i forget?
Why did you do it?
You surely had a reason.
I want to know
everything about you.
It's not your concern.
Go on home.
Leave me alone!
Morning sickness?
Knocked up by that wife-killer,
are you?
No. Stop it!
What a view!
You slut!
Don't be so smug,
you filthy wife-killer!
Gynecology clinic
how old are you?
I'm 34.
Your last period was in april?
You're four months pregnant.
Too late for an abortion.
It's highly irregular...
please.
I just can't have this baby.
I don't recommend one.
You should have it.
That turns me off.
I can't do it.
Should we send her back?
Let's wait a little longer.
But why?
Because you need her money?
Even with the money
i send my wife,
she won't agree to a divorce
yesterday, mr.
Mizumaki...
your mother gave me a vibrator.
He introduced me to a
creditor named machida.
If i become his mistress...
he'll forget the 10 million you owe.
What did you say?
You think it's a good idea?
Absolutely not...
i feel like giving mother
an overdose of sleeping pills.
And kill myself, too.
I need some peace.
I'm scared that it's hereditary.
If i'm in the way,
i'll kill myself!
Keiko,
are you all right?
It's very late.
Is it a nightmare?
I'm sorry.
Yes, just a nightmare.
Is it about mr.
Yamashita?
No,
it's nothing...
excuse me.
Care for a nip?
No,
i don't drink.
Come on!
A wee drop won't hurt.
Is keiko taking a holiday?
Either that or she's quit...
they used to say there
were no female eels.
Only males.
The females carry their eggs
2,000 kilometers or more, way down south.
They only lay when
the salinity's right.
2,000 kilometers!
That's as far as the equator.
The males follow behind.
Most of 'em die right there.
The tiny fry take up to
six months to return to japan.
Most of 'em die on the way back.
The ocean's full of dead fry.
I saw the paper on your door.
It was that takasaki.
It wasn't just a sutra.
It was dark,
no one else saw it.
I don't trust him.
I ripped it down, anyway.
So no one else would see it.
Is what he wrote true?
You don't have to tell me.
I couldn't forgive her...
because...
i loved her
i couldn't help myself.
I often wondered how i could kill
the one i loved so much...
i just couldn't forgive her.
When i killed emiko,
i died along withher.
I didn't want...
i couldn't accept anyone else.
When i read that letter...
that letter?
I wonder who wrote it?
What did you do with the letter?
- I threw it away.
- Threw it away?
Threw it away...
threw it away...
but when?
Where?
But maybe...
there was no such letter in the first place.
- Have you seen keiko?
- No.
She wasn't feeling well.
And she left this morning.
Have a seat.
She was always worrying about the shop.
We assumed she'd come here.
I thought she'd quit.
Why do you say that?
I told her about my past.
She naturally ran off.
No.
You've got it all wrong.
- But it's only natural.
- That's not it.
She loves you.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Mother,
shall we go?
Thank you all for everything.
Where are we going?
A wonderful place.
Like akita,
but it's not a hospital.
Let's go.
Come on!
Wrong number.
Please pay by the
end of the month.
Welcome.
Vice-president!
Good morning.
- Where are you now?
- In hachioji.
Good morning.
It's been such a long time.
You have mother's bank book?
Yes,
i think so...
where's the president?
He's out on an appointment.
- And mizumaki?
- He's with him.
Financial consultants.
I'm sorry,
he's out now.
Her seal, too.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
Okay, carry on.
Hey, yamashita.
The reverend and his wife came by.
He asked me about your girl.
I said i didn't give a shit.
Did you read my sutra?
No,
i threw it away.
Son of a bitch.
I did it for your soul.
You also wrote i'm a killer.
For my soul, too?
You're supposed to read it!
Then you'd understand.
It was the middle of the night.
No one else saw it.
I thought you went back home.
Why should i?
I hear you quit work.
My boss tried to stop me,
but he was happy.
People don't like ex-cons.
Stop bothering me.
I've had enough of you.
- Got any sake?
- No.
Get out of here!
Did you know she's pregnant?
I saw her puking.
Morning sickness.
Got a kid on the way,
have ya?
Get out of here!
Yeah, okay.
Clean up your act!
I can't wait to see
what the kid's like.
I bet it'll be like this.
You asshole!
I've been on parole for 3 years.
I've had no luck!
I copied sutras every day
and visited my victim's grave.
But it wasn't worth shit!
Of course.
What good would that do?
You bastard!
You're only acting.
It's not from your heart!
Bastard!
What would you know about me?
In prison you were
trained as a barber.
Now you've got a shop,
and a girl.
Fucking's better than sutras,
huh?
She isn't my girl,
you fool!
Fuck you!
You're such a smart-ass.
You're the smart-ass.
Those prayer beads! Just another act.
An ex-con with no job
or no money needs prayer beads.
This is bullshit!
Praise buddha!
Is this what you want?
You make me laugh!
Your shit don't stink!
You make a slut pregnant!
You're like a little schoolboy!
Why keep bothering me?
I'm sick of you.
I get it.
You must be lousyin bed.
What?
I said, you couldn't give
a good fuck if you tried!
You found your wife with another man.
That hurt!
You could only fuck her like a kid.
You're a lousy lay.
You saw that guy
fucking her like an expert,
it made you crazy,
so you killed her.
You never fucked anyone but her,
you little schoolboy!
Hey, yamashita!
You think jealousy is wrong,
don't you?
It's jealousy,
no matter what kind of act you put on.
You're only human.
I'm a real man!
I want to fuck a woman.
I hate this bullshit,
schoolboy crap!
I'll rape some chick
and go back to prison.
Reciting a sutra between
the warm thighs of a woman.
So long,
you little schoolboy fuck-up!
All praise to buddha...
hello.
Sorry for just leaving.
I had a lot to do.
- Sorry for the trouble.
- Where have you been?
- Come on inside.
- I'm very sorry.
A man calling himself dojima
dropped by earlier.
He was looking for you.
Some financial problem, he said.
He went to yamashita's place.
Yamashita's place?
I'm really sorry for everything.
This is my mother's
bank book and her seal.
Can you keep them for me?
We can do that,
but how much is in there?
Thirty million yen.
It was outrageous of me,
but it is mother's money.
I'm vice-president,
so i just took it.
It's a fortune!
How is your mother?
She's going back to akita.
Why throw her out?
But i didn't.
It's almost as if you did.
This place needs keiko.
Everyone knows that without keiko
the service here is lousy.
Keiko broke into my office
and stole 30 million yen.
Where is she?
I wouldn't tell you if i knew!
This is serious business.
Where's keiko?
Bring her here!
We don't know where she is.
Yes, you do.
Masaki,
go get the cops!
She stole my money.
I want it back.
You're free to search the place,
but she's not here.
Find her!
You go look out back.
You go upstairs.
The thing is...
i checked up on you.
You're on parole,
aren't you?
This is my lawyer,
naito.
You shouldn't get involved
in this kind of trouble.
You already served eight years.
You want to go back?
Are you threatening me?
It's in your best interests.
Come quick!
A man called dojima barged
into yamashita's place.
- I'd better go.
- I'll come, too.
I'm going, too.
I'll get the car.
Awano,
take over here!
She's not here.
We told you she's not.
Now fuck off!
Get out!
Stay back!
Who are you?
I'm a friend of them both.
You bastards!
There's no need for violence!
I'll bring keiko
to court for theft.
You don't want any cops,
do you?
I couldn't care less.
Hey, boss!
What are you doing here?
What are you talking about?
You stole my money!
That money isn't yours.
It was to be invested
in my new company.
I've got papers to prove it.
You saw them.
It belongs to my mother.
So go ahead, sue me.
I'd love to!
Your loony mother will
make a great witness!
We have power of attorney.
Return the money.
Why should i let you have it?
It's all she's got left.
Who gives a shit!
She's an investor.
I've got the papers!
Return those papers to her.
What's that?
No need to get involved.
Return the power of attorney.
Are you crazy?
No way.
What's it to be?
Yes, or no?
What's with you?
She's only worth fucking!
Whatever you think.
You bastard!
You stay out of it!
Look carefully, officer.
It's me being violent.
Okay, stop it.
That's enough.
Everyone, stop it!
That's enough!
Where's my money,
bitch?
Stop it!
It's all her doing!
Where did you hide my money?
She threw herself at me, too.
You're both fucking crazy!
Don't stop me.
Damn you!
You bitch!
Yamashita!
Stop it!
Stop it, i said!
Keiko's pregnant!
You're all fixed.
Pregnant with my kid?
No way!
It's not yours!
Then,
is it his?
Yes, it's mine!
Fuck you!
Stop it now!
What have i done!
I'm sorry!
You mongrel!
Lady!
That's enough!
Get out of my way!
It's my baby.
Police station
how did it go?
The power of attorney
has no signature.
The money belongs
to your mother after all.
And mr.
Yamashita?
No charges against takada.
But as for yamashita,
there'll be a parole violation hearing.
He'll have to wait four or five days.
I'll be in touch.
I'm sorry.
Does your head still hurt?
No, i'm okay.
It doesn't hurt anymore.
I got you into this.
I did it on my own.
We decided to have
a party tonight.
All of us?
To shed the bad luck
and celebrate your lady's pregnancy.
Celebrate my pregnancy?
Sorry.
Everyone thinks it's yours.
It must bother you.
They'd decided anyway.
I just confirmed it.
I'll have an abortion.
Don't.
Have the baby.
The reverend can
sit in the middle.
Come on,
masaki!
Where are you going,
yuji?
Where are you going?
He's going to do something.
C'mon, applaud!
Mr. Yamashita,
dance with me. Come on.
First a brat...
next a murderer...
what a pervert.
There were no letters.
Jealousy made you hallucinate.
Finally i've become like you.
I'll raise a kid by some
unknown father.
Your mother laid her
eggs near the equator.
Anonymous sperm
fertilized them to life.
Nobody knows your father.
But you're still a fantastic eel.
Sacrificing themselves,
they escort the babies back to japan.
Those who are born should
be cared for, right?
Time to say good-bye.
Farewell.
Closed
my statement should
carry some clout.
You'll soon be free again.
Thank you.
How long do you think?
About a year,
i reckon.
Can we stop on the way?
Sure.
We'll wait here.
You can have the barber's pole.
Thank you.
Take good care of yourself.
Can i wait for you?
Wait until you come back?
Take good care of the baby.
We'll both be waiting for you.
Did you know that
eels travel far?
What's that?
They travel as far as the equator
then return to the mud here.
You think they'll come?
Who?
The flying saucers.
If you put your heart into it,
i'm sure they will.
