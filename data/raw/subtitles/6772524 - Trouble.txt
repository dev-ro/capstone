Good morning, Master Trouble.
Another beautiful day.
Ah!
It, it attacked me!
Bat! A giant, blood-sucking bat!
[barking]
Oh, my goodness!
Master Trouble, are you okay?
Argh! How did that get in here?
Did it sink its fangs into me?
Oh, no! Do you think
I have rabies from that?
[barking]
Shall we grab the bug spray?
[barking]
Did you see the size of that thing?
More like get the blood-sucking bat spray!
-[barking]
-Quickly, summon Cesar at once.
[whimpering]
[whimper]
Waggy tails and Kibble kisses.
Come on. Go to your happy place.
Nothing can hurt you.
[toy squeaking]
You remember, nothing can hurt you.
Think about warm puppy milk dreams
and chew toy fairies.
[toy squeaking]
Mm!
[spitting]
Oh, thank heavens he wasn't killed.
Argh! Flea!
[sucking]

[gasping]
Better her than you.
Ah, perfect! He is ready.

Madam, I present your loyal companion,
Trouble.

[sirens blaring]
[indistinct chattering]
Uh, hello. I, I, I just landed
on my face, here.
Is, is someone going to call
the veterinarian, or...?
I... might have bent a whisker.
Hello?
Why isn't anyone paying attention to me?
[door closing]
[sirens blaring in the distance]
[tires screeching]
[siren fading]
[soft, melancholic music]
[birdsong]
[Norbert] Oh, wow! This is huge!
Look at the size of that thing!
[tires screeching]
She's gone!
[crying]
I can't believe it.
Aunt Sarah's gone.
What are you talking about, Claire?
We hardly knew her.
She was just our crazy old aunt.
Our rich old aunt.
Who we loved and missed very much.
Remember?
[maniacal laughter]
[clearing throat]
Ms. Claire and Mr. Norbert?
Welcome to the Vanderwhoozie home--
Oh!
Oh, dear beloved sweet old aunt.
How I miss her.
My condolences.
Mr. McBain will meet you in the study
shortly for the reading of the will.
Can I get you anything while you wait?
Oh, I can't even imagine
having anything at a time like this.
But since you're offering,
I'll take a latte.
One of those fancy ones with hazelnut
and a sprinkling of chocolate.
Oh, and a lot of ice. Cubed not crushed.
Ugh, and definitely no whipped cream.
Got it?
Can I get a tuna melt?
Farm raised or wild Alaskan?
Uh... just the fish kind.
I'll see what I can do.
[fake crying]
Took long enough for the old bird
to kick the bucket.
Ugh. That painting is tasteless.
We should sell it immediately.
Perfect opportunity to try my new app.
[dinging]
Claire! That thing's worth
over a million dollars!
Cha-chong!
We are going to be so filthy rich!
Argh!
Who knew that we were related
to The Mummy?!
[dinging]
-[laughing]
-How old was she, like, seven hundred?
-Ahem.
-[gasps]
Oh, this is so sad.
[phone dinging]
Where's the cinnamon?
Did I not say cinnamon?
Ugh.
Make it like I like it this time!
Thanks, James!
Oh, he is a joy to boss around!
Norbert, get a value
on those crystal vases,
antique furniture, and that chandelier.
[dinging]
-Yay!
-Ka-ching!
And golden staircase!
Those ornate vases. Ha! Ha! Ha!
That's strange.
Wait a second. She had a dog?!
[barking]
Norbert! Norbert!
Get this flea bag off of me!
Dogs are noisy, and hairy,
and smelly, and dirty.
And any money spent on dogs
-means less money spent on us.
-Exactly.
Now, we need to organize
all the valuable items for sale.
Right.
What about the worthless items?
The estate sale truck will be here soon.
Dump it outside.
[groaning]
[door slamming]
[Trouble] Animals! They obviously
don't know who I am.
Mrs. Vanderwhoozie is not
going to be okay with this.
When she finds out that they
manhandled me like this,
there's going to be-- argh!
Par-Pardon me, Sir.
Sir! What are you doing?
Those are my things.
-[squeaking]
-Mr. Honk?
Wait, where are you going with Mr. Honk?
-[barking]
-Hey, stop it!
Get out of here!
[whimpering]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Careful! If you break anything, I'll...
I'll, I'll have James do something.
Yeah, that's what I'll do.
Mr. Honk! Mr. Honk! Speak to me!
Are you okay?
[whimpering]
One, two, three, four.
-Breathe!
-[squeaking]
Oh, thank the canine gods!
You're okay!
Oh, it must have been horrible.
Can I... Can I get James to give you
a tumble dry,
with baby powder scented cleaning fluid?
[slamming]
Hey! Wait a minute!
Alright, that's it.
[engine turning over]
No problem.
Hello, everyone.
I have some sad news.
I bit the big one! He! He!
I've cashed in my chips.
[chuckling]
I'm dead.
[chuckling]
I've always wanted to do that.
[sighing]
She's just as annoying
-as when we were kids.
-Hm.
So, I've decided to pass on my fortune
to my only living relatives,
Claire and Norbert Vanderwhoozie.
Oh, yeah!
We get the money!
We get the money! We get the money!
[Claire] Norbert!
Ha!
But, with my fortune comes
a great responsibility.
You must be willing and able
to take care of my loyal
companion, Trouble.
Trouble? Who's in trouble?
- ...precious years.
-[beeping]
No one. Trouble is the dog.
Ha! Ha! Ha! Who cares about the dog?
You do. He's in your care.
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no!
No! I am not a dog person!
No?
Then I'm afraid you forfeit
the rights to the entire fortune.
But... Oh!
This dog isn't even like a dog to me.
It's more like family!
Family on four legs!
Oh, I've always loved Terrible.
Uh, Trouble.
The dog's name is Trouble.
Ugh, whatever! We simply adore her!
Him.
Him! We just love that little pooch!
Where is he?
Here, dog!
Dog? Where are you?
-Dog!
-I think I saw it by the shed.
Excuse me? He's in a shed?
No! No, no, no! Not a shed!
Ha! Ha! Le Shed!
It's a dog groomer. Very exclusive.
After everything the little guy
has been through,
we just thought he could use
a little R &amp; R.
A little TLC for the D-O-G.
[laughing]
Now, where do we sign
to get our inheritance?
[executor] Oh, no signing today.
Your Aunt Sarah specified in her will
that you must first spend some time
with her beloved Trouble, to bond.
-But--
-Then, after that, if you're both
happy with each other,
we'll move forward.
Oh, he'll be happy.
We'll be happy.
We'll be one big happy family.
We laugh all the time.
Shut it, Norbert, I'm talking.
I'll be back on Monday.
That should give you enough time
to get acquainted with Trouble.
[nervous chuckling]
What just happened? Are we rich or not?
Ugh! Not until we make friends
with that stupid dog.
And come Monday,
we're going to take that thing
straight to the pound.
[crow cawing]
[tires screeching]
-[squeaking]
-[Trouble] Oh! Ah! Ugh!
[sighing]
How could this happen?
I'm a Vanderwhoozie. This is terrible.
What? What? What is this? Dirt?
I don't do dirt!
I do creams, fur treatments, exotic oils.
My coat should be shinier
than a beaver dipped in Vaseline.
I pride myself on my clean appearance,
stank you very much!
-[rattling]
-Argh! Oh!
Ugh.
Ah!
Who are you? What do you want?
Don't hurt me!
Whoa, what is this stuff?
Ah!
Wait, this is Mrs. V's lipstick
and make-up.
She never went anywhere
without this stuff.
[Trouble whining sadly]
[whining]
She never went anywhere without that hat.
She never went anywhere
without that handbag.
That's me.
She never went anywhere without me.
If everything you love
is in the back of this truck, then...
where are you?
-[rattling]
-[barking]
[whining]
[howling]
[crickets chirping]
-Ah!
-[trunk horn honking]
[screaming]
Ah!
[grunting]
Ah!
[grunting]
Ah!
[Claire moaning]
Ah, that's it.
Just another three hours of this,
and you can start on my feet.
Huh!
-I can't find him anywhere.
-What?!
I checked the pool house, the greenhouse,
and... the shed house.
You idiot!
Why would she even have one of those?
This house has nine bathrooms.
Shed house. I said shed house.
Well, if you don't want
to end up in the dog house,
then you had better bring back Trouble.
-[cracking]
-[groaning]
Or find me someone who can!
-Got it?
-[cracking]
Now leave. You're annoying my masseuse!
[sighing]
A little to the left, James.
-[cracking]
-Ah!
[birds chirping]
[leaves rustling]
[chattering]
[snoring]
[chattering]
[snoring]
-[thudding]
-Oh! Who is that?
[Trouble] James?
Oh, hey, hey, hey! Stop that!
Oh!
Oh! Ahem, hey there.
You know, I think I fell
asleep in that tree, and, um...
Oh, no! Will you look at this?!
My fur is completely matted--ow!
Where did that come from?
[rumbling]
[chattering]
[loud crashing]
[whimpering]
Is it just me, or does anyone
else need to pee right now?
Nobody...
[snapping]
...touches our nuts.
Ha... I have a butler who can
vacuum those up for you
in a jiffy.
[squeaking]
Somebody has assaulted our nuts!
You might need to work
on your worrying a little.
[snapping]
Ah!
James! Help!
It took us a whole year to save up
those nuts,
and now they're gone!
What do you think,
nuts just grow on trees, or something?
[Trouble screaming]
Let's get him boys!
Let's teach him a lesson
for unplugging our nuts.
[squeaking]
-Whoo!
-Hey, hey, hey!
Give that back! Ow!
[soft whimper]
[laughing]
Hey! You can't take that!
That's mine!
Ah! Great!
Hello? Is anybody out there?
James? Where are you?
This must be a dream.
I-I'm having a bad dream.
I just need to wake up,
or start thinking about cotton candy.
[honking]
Oh! Mr. Honk?
Don't worry, I'm coming!
I'm right here, buddy.
-Hang on. I'm right...
-[continuous honking]
...here?
[sniffing]
Wow! I've never smelled so many smells.
[indistinct chattering]
[funky music]
[sniffing]
Ah-ha! That's what I've been looking for.
Mm!
[slurping]
[sniffing]
Ah... Liverwurst.
[growling]
-Knock, knock.
-Who's there?
-You gotta.
-You gotta, who?
You got about a second left to live
if you take one more bite of my dinner.
That's disgusting.
-Have a little class.
-Class? Hm.
No offence, but this coming from a dog
hanging out in the back of a meat truck.
[growling]
-[barking]
-Ah!
You're going to get us both caught.
What the...? Hey! Come here, you!
[whimpering]
-[barking]
-Oh!
[screaming]
Ugh! Get off me!
Look out!
[man grunting]
Can't see!
[indistinct chattering]
-[chattering stops]
-Well, this place is charming.
[gasps]
Gotta get out of here.
[in French] My God!
[in English] Dogs in my restaurant?
No!
[crowd gasping]
[Chef] No!
[Chef] Bad dog! Bad dog!
Don't mess with Chef Ludo!
Ah!
Oh! Coq au vin!
[crowd gasping]
[Chef] No! Not my dessert cart!
Ah!
[both grunting]
[gasps]
You just cost me a meal.
Yes! Pizza!
Oh, and it's Pauly's!
Wait a minute!
Hey! That's mine!
Come back here!
No, no! No!
Ugh. This cannot be happening!
[indistinct chattering]
[car rattling]
[tires screeching]
Ugh! Stupid piece of junk!
This is the first thing I'm replacing
when I'm rich.
When we're rich.
[birds chirping]
This is his office?
This guy gets five stars on TrackerGuy.com
It says that he can track down any animal.
[elephant trumpeting]
[monkey noises]
[mechanical humming]
Thurman Sanchez?
And I'm back!
You caught me channelling
a ringtail lemur.
That was you up there?
On the trail of Chumpy.
Escaped from Central Zoo last night.
Exotics are my specialty.
Well, we need to find a dog.
A dog?!
[snickering]
I don't track dogs.
I'm not a dog catcher.
Well, this one is very special.
Dogs drink out of toilets.
Dogs beg for treats.
They are the circus clowns
of the animal world.
We'll pay any price.
However, I do have a hole in my schedule.
We need him by Monday.
Ooh, sounds like a rush job. That's extra.
[sniffing]
Target looks like a mid-sized
domestic 30-pounder.
40 percent Terrier.
10 percent Alaskan Klee Kai.
[chewing]
Oh! Is that Maltese?
[gagging]
Alright. Cut the magic tricks.
Can you find him or not?
Wolves, jackals, canines,
they're all the same.
They follow the paw prints
of their ancestors.
-[gun clicking]
-[gasping]
I'll bring him back,
even if it's in pieces.
No, no! No! One piece!
Uh-huh. Dead or alive.
Alive! Not dead.
Make it look like an accident? Got it!
-Are you crazy?
-Maybe. Perhaps.
[whirring]
[engine turns over]
I'll be off the grid for a while.
You can reach me on this.
Okay, listen to me.
The dog's name is Trouble.
If we don't find him by Monday morning,
we could lose everything.
I hunt the most vicious predators
on the planet.
-[engine revving]
-I think I can find a domesticated canine.
[tires screeching]
This better work!
He's like the Dalai Lama
of Dr. Doolittles.
You're like the idiot of idiots.
[grumbling mockingly]
Hey, pizzas are cut in slices
for a reason, you know!
So that everyone gets a piece.
-[barking]
-Whoa, easy there, Miss Anger Management.
It's Rousey.
My name is Rousey.
[chewing]
Ever heard, "Sharing is caring?"
You ever hear,
"Eating gets you a beating?"
Ever hear, "Compassion is fashion?"
"Trespassing gets you a trashing."
"Do a good deed for those in need."
"A punch in the nose will make you bleed."
"Don't go to bed until you're fed."
"One step closer and you'll be dead."
Check and mate!
Nicely played, Scarface!
Hey, what did you call me,
you little runt?
[squirrels chattering]
Where did these guys come from?
-[snapping]
-You thought you could run,
you thought you could hide.
Hey there, nut disruptor!
Nut disruptor? What does that mean?
Um... I may have been in a little mishap
involving a large quantity of nuts.
[Rousey] Is that one wearing a girdle?
Actually, that's my collar.
You messed up my nuts.
You tossed them around.
You got them all dirty.
Rubbed them into the ground.
Ugh. This never stops
sounding inappropriate.
Now that we're nutless,
we ain't got no food.
So we'll take what you got.
Go get it, dudes!
Don't even think about it,
you off-Broadway Beavers!
This is my pizza, not yours.
Not whoever he is.
Trouble. My name's Trouble.
Of course it is!
Pepperoni, mushrooms, olives, cheese!
Give us some pizza!
Extra onions, please!
[burping]
I'm full.
Have at it, boys.
The rest of the pizza is all you.
Wait, wait, wait! You're not leaving me
out here with these...
these bucktoothed bush rats?
No! No! No!
[Trouble] No! Stay back!
This is my pizza!
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
And, and there were these two dogs.
Big one, and there was a little one.
And I was heading right for them,
so what do I do?
If I turn left, I'll hit oncoming traffic.
If I turn right,
I'll go right into a wall.
So, I hit the brakes. Screech!
And that's when, pop!
And then whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!
Plop! So, the pizza box,
it's sitting right there between them,
and the big one grabs it and takes off.
And the little one chases after
the big one, and I'm like,
"Hey! Bring that back!" And they didn't,
because, well, you know, they're dogs.
So, you were robbed by dogs.
Is that what you're telling me?
-Well, if you just say it like that...
-Let me tell you something.
How do you expect to move up
the ranks of the pizza biz
if you do a job like this? Seriously?
I'm not really looking to move up
in the pizza biz.
-I want to be a singer.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know what,
this is coming out of your check.
-But--
-Write a song about that. Ha! Ha!
The dog, what, they ate your...
[stammering]
No, I can't even.
It's too stupid for words.
[sighing]
Great.
[engine revving]
[sniffing]
Oh!
[tires screeching]
[birds calling]
[soft grunt]
[sniffing]
He has been here.
[birds chirping]
[sniffing]
He was on the ground. Unconscious.
In a coma? No.
Asleep.
He was woken.
There was an encounter...
with a ferret! No.
A rabbit? Strike that!
Squirrels.
The squirrels approached from
the north-east in an aggressive manner.
Something happened here.
But what?
[whooshing]
[inhaling slowly]
Something.
Some biting, jumping,
synchronized dancing.
Synchronized dancing?
No. No, that's insane.
-But something.
-[cacophonous ringtone music]
-[beeping]
-Any updates?
Sleep. Dirt. Squirrels.
These are the highlights.
Then I'm going to need more
than the highlights.
I am close.
I can smell it so much, I can taste it.
I am within striking distance.
No striking! Just catching! Remember?!
We need him in one piece.
I'll keep that in mind...
when I go in for the kill!
-But--
-Totally killing it! Thanks, buddy!
[beeping]
[soft strumming]
[sighing]
[beeping]
[ringing on line]
Hello, Jason Mraz here.
Hi.
I-I'm calling to enter
the singer-songwriter competition.
[Jason] Yeah. Yeah. What's your name, hon?
Zoe. Zoe Bell.
Zoe Bell.
And what's the name of your song?
[softly] Chair... chair, best...
Um, Room!
Room? Like in four walls?
Room... For Improvement.
Well, we'll see you at the competition
on Monday at 10AM.
[beeping]
[softly] Gotta write a song
by Monday? Great.
Room For Improvement? Ugh!
Hello?
Rousey?
Rousey?
Hello? Ah!
-What do you want?
-I'm lost.
I don't know where home is.
-Home?
-Yes.
This big house on the top of the hill.
Then why don't you go back there?
I'd love to, I just...
I just seem to be a bit lost.
That sounds like a you problem.
Oh! Huh...
Yeah, okay.
Now-- Argh! Oh!
Ugh.
What is this? Ugh!
A hundred miles from a bathtub.
It's getting chilly out.
Can I stay with you tonight?
You want to stay at my place?
Ah, that would be great.
Thank you! Thank you!
Ready whenever you are.
For what?
To go to your house.
Here you are.
Welcome.
But, but...
[stammering]
You're an outside dog?
Don't you label me.
I-It's cool. Totally cool.
Ugh. This is not ideal.
I haven't had my teeth brushed, and...
and there are an alarming lack of pillows.
I don't suppose you have something
like a warm blanket?
Perhaps cashmere?
[Trouble whimpering]
[sighing]
Comfy?
Why, yes. Yes, I am.
[yelping]
I don't snuggle.
[Trouble whining]
[Trouble snoring]
[Trouble shivering]
-Hey, Rousey!
-Ugh.
[Trouble laughing]
What are we doing today?
There's no "we".
[birds chirping]
I thought maybe we could go
on another pizza run.
-Or...
-Stop saying "we".
There is no "we".
So... What are you going to do today?
Whatever I have to do to survive.
I hunt for food, eat, and rest.
But when do you play?
Play?
I don't play.
-Ever?
-Ever!
You can't just leave me out in the jungle.
I travel alone!
-But--
-Alone!
But...
What is that?
[dogs barking in the distance]
[Rousey] That's the dog park.
So many dogs playing together?
Hey, hey! Maybe they could help me
find my way home.
You know, come to think of it,
they could help you.
-Really?
-Definitely.
Ha! Thanks, Rousey.
I owe you one!
[scoffing]
Dumb dog.
[man] She's adorable!
[woman] Thank you!
-You forgot your leash!
-Ready, girl? Ready for the ball?
[panting]
[man] What did you get into, man?
[indistinct chattering]
-[barking]
-Ready, girl? Ready for the ball?
Go get it!
Atta boy! Good job!
-Norm!
-Hey, Bella!
Hey, Gizmo! How's it going?
Ah, not good.
I think my owner wants to kill me.
-What?!
-Murder?!
He spent all day yesterday trying
to teach me how to play dead.
If that isn't a precursor to homicide,
I don't know what is.
Relax, Gizmo.
It's like shake a paw or roll over.
Playing dead is like a dog trick.
How is being dead a trick?
I don't understand that.
I'm telling you, he watches too much CSI.
CSI Miami, CSI New York,
CSI Las Vegas.
CS-I think he wants me dead!
Relax, it's a basic dog trick. Watch.
[mimicking choking]
No, no, no.
He's up to something, I can feel it.
Ever since I peed on his video game,
he's been out to get me.
Ah, jeez, Bella!
Do you have to do that in front of us?
All this murder talk is making me nervous.
You know I scratch when I get nervous.
-Guys, guys, guys, guys!
-Tippy! What is it? Spit it out!
New dog! New dog! New dog!
New dog! New dog! New dog!
[Norm] Well, what do you know?
We got ourselves a rookie.
[sniffing]
Ah! Wait, wait, whoa, hey!
Whoa, hey!
What-what are you doing?
Relax, alright?
This is standard procedure for newbies.
We got to get a little background
information on you.
That's how we know what's right,
we sniff the butt.
Okay...
You slept eight hours last night.
Dreamt about Samba dancing
with a cat, weird!
Got up to pee twice.
One movement, solid.
And you farted!
Whoo-hoo-hoo, he's good!
Oh, so, what? Kind of like
a backdoor web search thing?
[sniffing]
Is that blueberry?
[sniffing]
Is that fruit smoothie?
Wait. How could a butt smell so... fresh?
Do you wipe with a chammy?
I don't wipe. I get misted.
Something's not right.
Where you from, pal?
The mansion on the hill.
You live in a mansion? On a hill?
And you've never wiped
your own butt clean?
Of course not!
What am I, some kind of animal?!
But butt wiping is the best
feeling in the world.
Let's show him, guys.
-Oh yeah!
-Oh yeah!
-Oh yeah! Right there!
-Now that's it!
[Gizmo] Oh yeah! Give it to me!
Yeah baby! Work it!
Oh!
Oh! Oh!
Mm-mm, this is not good for us.
Gizmo, how is a dog wiping his butt
for the first time not good for us?
I mean, look at him. No collar.
He's obviously a stray.
And a good-looking one at that.
I mean, his butt smells
like potpourri, for God's sake!
If that mutt comes home with you or me,
we're going to have to share everything.
Do you understand?
Everything!
Ha! Wow, that was really refreshing.
So, where's your collar?
Oh well, that's an interesting story.
See--
You're a stray.
I am not a stray!
No collar. No owner.
You're a stray.
And strays end up in one place.
The dog pound.
You know what happens to dogs
at the pound,
-don't you?
-[screeching]
What do I do? I don't want
to go to the dog pound.
Well, there is one sure way
to get someone to take you home.
[vehicles honking]
So, what are the odds?
I feel good about his chances.
[screaming]
Two bones says he doesn't make it.
Two bones and a raw hide says he does.
You guys are sick!
-[honking]
-[tires screeching]
I bet four bones he chickens out.
[horns blaring]
[Gizmo] What's he doing?
What's he doing? What's he doing?
Run away from the cars!
-[horn blaring]
-Whoa!
You've got to move around!
Ah!
[Tippy] What is he doing?
-[horn blaring]
-[screaming]
[tires screeching]
What? Oh, you got to be kidding me.
You're the pizza thief.
[whimpering]
Ugh! I don't have time for this.
Where do you live?
Don't you have a home?
Oh, ugh.
I guess I have to take you with me.
This is just temporary,
until I find where you came from.
You got that?
He's doing it! Can you believe this?
The kid is doing it!
-He's doing it!
-I don't know what to say.
I do. You two owe me some bones.
[Gizmo laughing]
[growling]
[sniffing]
[Chef] Slobber on my appetizer!
Ruining my reputation.
-This is not a doggy diner!
-[sniffing]
Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing?
-Having a dog problem?
-Yes! I'm having a dog problem.
Does your dog problem look like this?
[in French] Yes!
[in English] That's the one!
I promise if I see it again I will--
A second dog.
Soil, pine needles.
[sniffing]
Forest!
What?
[Trouble barking]
Shh! You have to be quiet.
[Trouble whimpering]
Shh, shh, shh. Almost there.
[whimpering continues]
-Miss Bell!
-Oh, no.
The rent is late. Again.
Yeah, about that.
-[Trouble scratching]
-There was a bit of a snafu...
Ah!
Whoa! Whoo! What is this place?
There better be food. I'm starving.
There's the kitchen.
The dining room.
The living room.
Is the whole house in one room?
I think I've been saved by a poor person!
If you can't pay your rent on time,
I'll find a tenant that will.
I'm going to get it to you.
I always do, don't I?
If I don't get it by the end of the week,
you will be evicted.
-[barking]
-What is that? What is that noise?
Noise? I didn't hear a noise.
-[barking]
-There! I heard it again!
Is that a dog?
Do you have a dog in there?
Uh... Oh, that's just my new ringtone.
-[barking]
-Oh! There is goes again! Ha!
Three barks. Must be important.
Excuse me. I have to take this.
Pff!
Millennials and their phones!
-[sighing]
-[objects clattering]
-Hey! Hey! Ugh!
-[panting]
Watch it!
I only have four plates, you know.
-[barking]
-Quiet!
No barking!
[whimpering]
Look at you.
Just all alone and lost
in the big, mean city.
Looking for somewhere to belong.
-[barking]
-Okay, okay.
I get it. You're hungry.
Let me see what I can find for you.
Yes! Leftovers!
Oh, I wonder what it'll be.
Mac and cheese with caramelized bacon? Mm!
Potato soup, or even better,
pork chops with shallot butter.
Yes!
-There you go.
-Aw...
[sniffing]
Oh!
I have moved in with a poor person!
You eat, little dog.
I got a song to write.
Eat? This?
Even a cat with nine lives
couldn't survive this.
A cat with 300 lives
and a flair for eccentric cuisine
couldn't survive this.

Argh! Why, you little...!

Oh!
[Zoe] What was I thinking?
I can barely pay the rent.
I'm delivering pizzas
instead of writing my songs.
And I'm like, "Hey, Zoe, why don't you
take in a pesky,
demanding, butt-wiping dog?
That should alleviate all your problems!"
Outside, little butt wiper!
[grumbling]
[panting]
[door closes]
[sniffing]
She put me out with the trash?
-[clanging]
-[cat shrieking]
[sirens blaring]
[dogs barking]
[cat shrieking]
Okay... This is not pleasant.
I think I need to talk to Cesar.
[Trouble] Go to the safe place.
Go to the safe place.
Argh! Chewy toy delights!
-Well, look who it is.
-Rousey?
I thought the squirrels finished you off.
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?
These garbage cans
are on my nightly dinner route.
You trying to move in on my turf again,
you little pip-squeak?
-[growling]
-Hey. Easy, easy.
She picked me up off the street.
I had no choice.
Yeah, well, don't get too attached.
Humans will kick you out the door
any chance they get.
Do not trust them for a second.
What? No human
would ever treat me badly.
Then how come you're standing in the dark,
in the freezing cold,
next to a pile of garbage cans?
Because...
Oh.
Told you, see.
Now you're an outdoor dog like me.
You don't understand.
I don't do outdoors.
I'm a throw pillow, filtered water,
brushed twice a day kind of indoor dog.
Not anymore.
She's the pizza delivery girl, right?
I'll make you a deal.
A deal?
You help me get pizza,
and I'll help you be an outdoor dog.
No. No, you're wrong.
This human is good.
She saved me, picked me up out of traffic.
Humans love me.
I don't want to be an outdoor dog.
Don't say I didn't warn you about humans.
Good luck, mutt!
-[clanging]
-Ah!
[growling]
Ah!
-[guitar melody]
-[Trouble barking]
[scratching]
Quiet! You're going to get me
kicked out of here!
Then I will have no place to go,
and neither will you.
-You got that?
-[barking]
[sighing]
Look at you.
You don't even know where you are, do you?
Just a lost little stray,
looking to fit in.
Well, you got it easy.
I had to work three jobs just to save up
and strike out on my own.
Something my parents did not
want me to do, by the way.
"Why don't you be a doctor?
Or a teacher?"
"How are you ever going
to survive as a singer?"
Anyway, there were arguments,
there were hurt feelings,
and now, I'm here all alone,
not feeling particularly confident.
Waiting for my star to rise.
Talking to a stray dog. Ha! Ha!
This just keeps getting better.
I am a joke.
[whimpering]
[chuckling]
All alone, far from home,
where's all my friends and family gone?
In a city so far away.
[barking]
I'm just a girl who lost her way,
another dreamer, another stray.
Ha. I can't tell if this song
is about you or me, buddy.
-[barking]
-That felt kind of good.
Okay, I get it.
Ramen noodle, probably not
the best choice for a dog.
How about a pizza slice?
-[barking]
-I get them free, anyhow, so...

[laughing]
[insects chirping]
I smell Trouble.
[growling]
You're not Trouble.
But he was here quite recently.
He formed an alliance of some sort.
A friendship.
[growling]
He slept here.
But then...
[clicking tongue]
...a playful romp, a fight to the death,
a lovers' spat.
[growling]
You thrust him away in a fit of rage
with your powerful hind legs.
And it was here that Trouble lay,
rejected, despondent, alone in the night.
And so, rejected,
Trouble ventured off into the woods.
[sniffing]
It is that waft of sorrow
that will lead me to him.
[thunder crashing]
[whimpering]
[thunder crashing]
Oh, buddy! It's okay.
It's just a little storm.
[Trouble exhaling]
Good morning!
[uptempo funky music]
[Bella] Can you believe this thing?
I mean, there goes all my licking.
Thank you, cone of shame.
She looks like a furry satellite dish.
Ha. Wait a second... Satellite dish.
What if the government is using Bella
to transmit secret messages
to the Russians?
Oh, no!
Oh, please!
It's a lick guard.
A saliva suppression device.
Got it?
That's what they want you to think.
[gate squeaking]
-Go on.
-[barking]
I'll find you after I put
these flyers up, okay?
Well, well, look who's back.
Road kill.
Guess what?
Playing in traffic totally worked.
Yeah. Lucky for you.
Except her place is extremely small,
like, no butler.
That's a minus.
So, you want her to adopt you?
Uh, I, uh, I thought you were
trying to get home.
She's helping me with that.
Good. Because, nothing personal,
but you don't really fit in here.
What? This little beat up,
pee-smelling park?
[sniffing]
It's not just pee.
Not to mention some of the rather
questionable clientele.
Will you get off?!
[screaming]
[squeaking]
[Norm] Well, excuse us, Mr. "I come
from a mansion on the hill".
Sorry we don't have butts
that smell like fruit smoothies.
Come on, gang.
Let's go find some squirrels.
-[growling]
-Jeez!
[Bella screaming]
Whoa.
Somebody stepped on my nut!
[snapping]
Somebody's going to pay.
Hey, no offence, guys,
but the past is the past.
Alright, and I'm sorry
I messed with your nuts.
Can I please just get my collar back?
It's the only thing I have left
of my old life.
Please!
Hey, yo, it's too late for you, mutt.
You ruined our nut... tss.
[laughing]
Boom, goes the squirrel. Get him, boys!
[Trouble] Please don't hurt me.
I promise, the first chance I get,
I'll refresh your nuts.
-[squeaking]
-Okay, that sounded so wrong.
Look, I just want my collar back.
Squirrels took your collar?
Oh, not in my park.
I thought you guys left.
Bella hears everything.
It's the cone. I hear dead people!
You may not have made
a good first impression, kid,
but we draw the line at squirrels.
No squirrel is ever going
to wear a dog collar in my lifetime.
Taking away a dog's collar
just ain't proper.
Let's get them, boys.
-[all growling]
-Charge!
[barking]
Ah!
-[growling]
-Ah!
Ooh!
[barking]
[squeaking]
[pop music]
[Thurman] Oh, don't worry,
little squirrel.
It's just a dominance thing.
Been there, done that.
[squeaking]
My collar! Give me my collar!
[barking]
Ya!
Aye!
Ha! Thurman always gets his vermin.
Ya!
[growling]
[barking]
[rumbling]
Guys! He's got Trouble!
[all barking]
[tires screeching]
[Trouble barking]
[tires screeching]
Ya!
[squeaking]
Hm, you're not Trouble.
Trouble?
-You know where he's at?
-[squeaking]
-You can lead me to him?
-[laughing]
[squeaking]
Oh, I'll make it worth your while.
-[cacophonous ringtone music]
-Oh, wait.
Speak.
What is happening?
We have less than 24 hours
to get that dog.
Roger that.
I got a lead from a reliable source.
Reliable source?
What reliable source?
Tree squirrels.
I can't believe
I'm even saying this, but...
will they talk?
[chuckling]
For a price.
[excited squealing]
See you later!
Hey, buddy, stay off the furniture,
and I'll bring you some pizza.
-[panting]
-I know you'll like that.
Ah, I got the place all to myself.
[cars honking]
Operation Trouble is in the final stages.
-[Norbert] You found him?
-Affirmative.
I'm about to go in for the kill.
[Claire] Did he say killing again?!
My rodent friends are about
to infiltrate the canine's domicile.
They'll be flushing him out momentarily,
at which time,
I'll intercept the package.
[Claire] And by rodent friends,
you mean...?
Squirrels, yes.
[suspenseful music]
Come on. We've got this.
[squeaking]
W-Wait, what are you guys doing here?!
[snapping]
[whimpering]
-[excited squeaking]
-[rock music]
Alright, this is not your place,
and that is not your property.
[growling]
[barking]
Not so fast! Hey, you, get off of that!
[barking]
Oh, oh, oh!
[Trouble barking]
-[splashing]
-Ah!
Hm!
You messed with the wrong dog.
[Trouble] No you don't!
Hey, hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa!
Where's that echo coming from?
Ooh, when I get this thing off my head,
you're all squirrel kebab.
Ah!
[all snickering]
[door opening]
Hey, buddy! I'm back.
[gasps]
[dramatic soft music]
[gasping]
[rattling]
-[whimper]
-[sighing]
You!
[soft whimper]
[inhaling audibly]
Bad dog!
-Bad dog!
-[whimper]
-I leave you alone for one--
-[Landlord] Miss Bell!
Argh! I just--
I knew you had a dog in here!
He isn't my dog.
He's just lost.
[Landlord] Well, now he's not,
-because I'm calling the pound.
-I... wait, I just--
Ah, da-da-da-da!
I've heard enough from you.
You're evicted from this apartment,
and you're not getting
your security deposit back.
-But, but--
-This place is a mess, Miss Bell.
I should have known better
than to rent to a Millennial musician.
What was I thinking?
I want you out of this apartment
by tomorrow!
[door slamming]
[sighing]
There you are.
I see you're looking for a home.
[growling softly]
Well, I got just the place.
[dogs barking]
[Trouble] Help! Help!
There's been a mistake!
I don't belong here.
I didn't do anything!
-[Rousey] I tried to tell you.
-Rousey?
Humans can't be trusted.
It's a story as old as time.
When things go bad,
the first thing humans do
is get rid of the dog.
No. Not this girl.
She was taking care of me and everything.
She would even sing to me.
She liked me.
W-What are you doing in here anyway?
Nothing.
It's a long story.
[Caramel] Not really, precious.
See, you were in the alley, mowing down
on half a discarded
meat lover's delight pizza
and a few teriyaki crazy wings,
when bam, bro! Dog catcher nodded you
like a sockeye salmon
sucking sourdough on the sea shore.
Shut up, Caramel!
Whoa. How's that not a long story?
Uh, excuse me, I'm not done yet.
Long story short, I was there too!
I got nabbed at the same time
and had an empty bag of sour cream
and onion chips stuck on my head,
didn't see the dog catcher bro coming.
Plus, I was riding some pretty gnarly
sour cream and onion fumes too, you know?
Dumpster diving, it's not pretty,
but it keeps us street dogs alive.
You feel me?
Well, look at the bright side.
You might be at the pound,
but you might get adopted too.
I told you, kid. Humans can't be trusted.
[slow harmonica melody]
I was like you once.
I had a family that supposedly loved me.
And I loved them too.
[barking]
[tires screeching]
[gasping]
[crying]
Oh, my God. Oh, honey!
Argh!
-Bad dog!
-[yelping]
But you saved his life!
Tell that to them.
All they saw was the cliché
killer pitbull.
Next thing I know,
I'm dumped in the pound.
A lousy stray.
But there's good people out there too.
I know it. I've seen it.
Oh yeah? Where's your pizza
delivery girl now?
Once you a stray, nobody wants you.
And they can smell it on you,
like a stink.
Like a stank.
Like a bear that ate too many berries,
and squats down behind a log and--
Stop! I get it.
Only choice now, kid,
is to turn you into a real dog.
An outdoor dog.
Well, first we have to have
a ceremonial butt sniff.
[sniffing]
[gagging]
You know, just to make sure
you're clean, bro.
Then once we're out of here, you're gonna
have to chase at least three cats.
Just so we know you're not one of them.
You're going to need to learn
how to bark, bite, and growl.
-[growling]
-Yeah.
Scrounge for food.
Fight with other dogs and squirrels.
A real dog!
That's not what real dogs do, Rousey.
We're supposed to be there
for our owners, let them play with us,
and feed us, call us silly names,
throw balls for us,
keep us healthy and safe.
Tickle our bellies, and laugh
when we eat peanut butter.
Hug us when they're sad.
[tearily] Shut up, kid.
[Trouble] And all they ask for
in return...
I said quit it!
...is that we give them
unconditional love.
[Trouble] When was the last time
you ever loved anyone, Rousey?
[sighing]
[phone chiming]
[door buzzing]
Ah-ha! That has to be her!
I told you she'd come for me.
Oh, there you are!
Oh great, this guy now.
You know this grease ball too?
Pfft. Everybody knows this fool, man.
He'll snatch you up for a dollar.
Well, I know he ain't here for any of us.
As my daddy once told me,
"Strays don't pay."
Dog, you just made that up.
You are absolutely correct
in your assumption, sir.
Oh, you are an elusive beast.
Your owners, and my bank account,
will be very pleased.
Hey, hey! Hey, get your-- whoa!
Huh.
Thurman always gets his vermin.
[Trouble barking]
Something doesn't smell right.
-It was the kibble.
-[farting]
Sorry.
Why should I care, right?
I tried to tell the kid
that humans were bad news.
Nothing but heartache.
And now, the pet snatcher guy has him.
That's what you get for putting
your faith in humans.
[slow harmonica melody]
Would you knock it off with the harmonica
and the sad prison music?
It's not a harmonica.
I actually make the sounds with my mouth.
Nothing? How about my French horn?
[upbeat French horn melody]
Are you here, boy?
Where are you, buddy?
I'm here to take you home.
-[dog whimpering]
-[Zoe] Where are you?
[sighing]
I just want to take you home.
I wish I could take you all home.
[whimpering]
[sighing]
[sniffling]
Um...
Am I the only one
getting emotional over here?
[crying]
[blowing nose]
Wow. She was, like, really sad.
Yeah. Like really, really, mega sad.
She really wanted Trouble back.
But that slime ball
with the greasy hair took him.
We... We gotta do something.
If I bust you guys out of here,
will you help me?
We in it to win it.
We'll be right behind you.
[doorbell chiming]
[sniffing]
[neck cracking]
Oh, there she is!
-He. He's a he.
-Ugh! Whatever!
As promised,
your canine has been returned.
Oh! I've missed you so, so much...
Make sure he's cleaned up.
We need him ready
for the big day tomorrow.
[Thurman clearing his throat]
So I suppose we should settle the bill.
[laughing]
The check is in the mail.
[doorbell chiming]
[inhaling]
[doorbell melody continues]
[sighing]
I don't do checks.
Oh, what a shame.
[doorbell chiming]
Norbert!
[doorbell melody glitching]
[fades out]
I want my money.
We're not paying you.
I guess we're doing this the hard way.
[door opening]
[humming softly]
[growling]
Alright, guys. Here's our chance.
Okay. On my cue.
[Rousey] Three, two, one.
[aggressive barking]
[barking]
[buzzing]
Jailbreak.

What is she doing here?
This park is for domesticate dogs only.
I'm looking for a, um... somebody.
Wait, isn't that Trouble's collar?
Fruit cocktail butt guy?
There's something I don't trust
about that guy, you know?
Has anyone checked to see
if he's on any no-fly lists?
Oh, I told him not to trust humans,
and now he's making
the biggest mistake of his life.
We haven't seen him.
Not since he got picked up by her.
Yes! That's the human who wants Trouble.
I mean, you should have seen
the broken-hearted look on her face.
But the problem is this creepy
animal catcher guy.
We saw him. He was here
during our squirrel war.
Well, where is he? He's got Trouble.
Hang on. I got this.
[sonar beeping]
A vintage Mustang.
[distant sirens]
A city bus.
Needs an oil and filter change.
She can hear everything.
Without a permit.
[Bella] An electric car. Good for them.
It's unconstitutional, if you ask me.
Shh! Oh, wait.
Wait, yes! Yes! I found it!
A 16-foot motorhome
with squeaky brakes and exhaust issues,
is that way at 49th and 16th,
turning right onto Piccadilly Boulevard.
Whoa! You are good! Thanks!
[Rousey whining]
[gasping]
Do, do you know where he is?
[barking]
Can you take me to him?
[Zoe] Come on, you guys.
We gotta get Trouble. Let's go!
[barking]
Okay, keep going straight.
Right now, take a right.
No, no! I mean a left, take a left! Hurry!
[executor] So, I trust the weekend
went well.
Oh, oh, yes, yes, yes!
Oh! We really connected
with the little fellow!
-[Trouble growling]
-Lots of walks, and...
...playing ball and biting things.
You know, typical dog stuff! Ha.
He even slept with me at night.
I'm happy to hear.
I know you lawyers get paid by the hour,
so let's not dilly-dally.
[tires screeching]
[doorbell melody glitching]
May I help you?
Uh... This is kind of hard to explain.
But I have reason to believe
that my dog is here.
Somewhere. I think.
[barking]
You be a good girl,
and wait here for me, okay?
[grunting unhappily]
Alright, listen up.
These two cheapskate scoundrels
are the target.
When I give the signal to attack,
you will swarm the target,
and then, in all the mayhem,
I snatch their precious pooch
and hold it for ransom,
until I get paid.
-You got that?
-[squeaking]
[snapping]
No, no, not yet my little friends.
There will be a time and place
for that, I promise.
Now, you have your orders.
[Thurman] Move out!
Uh, you mind telling me again
what we're doing here?
I saw Rousey pick up
that Trouble dog's collar.
Rousey don't pick up nothing
unless it's food.
Something ain't right.
If chilling in a giant mansion on a hill
with grass greener than Angelina Jolie's
eyes ain't right, bro-ski,
uh, then I don't know what is.
We about to find out. Come on.
Let's follow those squirrels.
There. I think we have everything we need.
It's about time!
[door opening]
Ahem, uh, pardon the interruption.
But may I present Zoe Bell.
-Who?
-[barking]
Oh! Thank goodness you're safe!
I've been looking everywhere for you.
What's going on here?
Who's she?
She's here to find her dog.
Well, he's not mine really.
But I have been taking care of him.
He was playing in traffic.
[James chuckling]
Apparently,
she saved him from certain death.
Hold on, I thought he was with you.
He was. This is a complete fabrication
from a girl who is clearly delusional.
[executor] What in the world?
I want my money, or else.
And who's this?
-I was hired to find that dog.
-[barking]
I've been chasing him all over
the city for the last week.
Well, this is completely
unacceptable behaviour.
It changes everything.
I swear I've never seen
this maniac in my life.
[Claire] We have a signed contract!
Oh, we had an agreement too.
I deserve that money!
Really? Well, as executor
of the Vanderwhoozie estate...
-Ah!
- ...you still need my signature,
and I don't think you'll be getting that.
-[Norbert] No!
-[Claire] No!
If you want to play rough,
then Daddy's going to play rough too.
Ooh!

Let's get 'em, boys!
Yeah!
[snapping]
[Trouble] Whoa, whoa! No! Stay back!
Ah-whoo-oo!
-[thudding]
-Not so fast, bush beavers!
You want them, you go through us first.
[growling]
-[sighing]
-Bring it.
Hey, hey! Snoop! Otis, Caramel!
What up, my dogs?
Let's bop it, drop it, bro-skis!
-[dramatic classical music]

[thudding]
Trouble?
[barking]
[angry squeaking]
Oh, I do hope my rabies shots
are up to date.
[Rousey barking]
[music tempo quickens]
-Ah!
-[gasping]
Alright! Give us what we want,
or the little guy gets it.
And believe me, I've been waiting
to do this a long time.
Oh.
I'm going to count to three.
And then... pfft!
-[gasping]
-One...
Oh, I do like his style.
-Two...
-I can't look!
And yet, I am.
Whoa!
-Three--
-[Rousey barking]
Okay, punk, you tell your little
tutu troupe to pack their tap shoes
and go home.
Dance class is over!

[squirrels chattering]
Rousey! You got out the pound.
You're free!
Oh yeah.
Hard to keep this old stray on lockdown.
But... But why did you come here?
Ugh... I never thought I'd say this but,
you belong with a human. That human.
She's been looking for you everywhere.
[indistinct chattering]
Oh, and I figured you'd want these back.
I... I don't know what to say.
You already said it, kid.
You made me look
at what I was doing, who I was.
I've been dumping on humans for so long,
I can't even remember
what it's like to be loved.
But when that girl came
to the dog pound looking for you,
all I could see was all kinds
of love in her eyes for you.
And it got me thinking.
If a human could love you,
ha, maybe there's one out there
that could love me too.
Ugh. Excuse me?
Are we done here? I'd like to get off
Noah's Ark, if that's possible.
Well, we're almost done.
With so many parties
vying to be Trouble's owner,
I think it best we let Trouble decide.
Let him pick who he wants his owner to be.
[birdsong outside]
You know, I never noticed this before,
but Rousey's kind of hot!
-Come here!
-Come here! Come here, girl!
-He's a he.
-Whatever.
-Look what I got you, Trouble.
-Boy! Come here! Dog!
I'll split whatever I get with you.
[Norbert] Come! Trombo!
-[Claire] What?!
-[gasping]
[licking]
Fine.
Well, looks like Trouble
has made his choice.
[executor] Mrs. Vanderwhoozie
always wanted Trouble
to go to someone who loved him,
and would give him a happy home.
All that remains is to make it official.
Wait, this means Trouble is mine?
Oh, not just Trouble, but all of it.
The mansion, the assets, and her fortune.
But... but I wouldn't know
what to do with all that.
All I really want is him.
You seem like a good person, Miss Bell.
Likewise, I'm sure you'll find something
good to do with the money.
[soft clapping]
[yelping]
[whining]
I promised myself I wouldn't do this.
Hug me!
Ugh! Ah!
-Horrible!
-Oh yeah.
The breath!
[blowing]
[grunting]
[barking]
[barking]
[applause]
[Zoe] Welcome everyone to the brand new
Vanderwhoozie dog park.
[cheering]
You know, every now and then,
we all get lost
and need to find a place
that feels like home.
[woman] Yeah.
The journey isn't always easy.
At one time or another,
we all might all feel like lost strays.
[Zoe] But if we share a little love,
open our hearts, and help each other,
we strays can find our way.
[crowd cheering]
[guitar melody]
[woman] We love you, Zoe!
