THE FOUR MUSKETEERS
I remember when they made
Musketeer D'Artagnan to the king.
It was a special ceremony.
Came the great personalities,
as distinguished
of French society.
Of course, I was there.
Who else but me, Aramis and Athos
layer could place it to D'Artagnan?
For the race
of a young person is important
be sponsored
by a person of honor and prestige.
It gives you confidence in yourself.
The king gave him his blessing,
Queen of course also because
D'Artagnan, Aramis,
Athos and I we prevent
knew that their relationship
with the Duke of Buckingham.
What a silly woman,
looks at fall in love with an Englishman
Prime Minister and over.
D'Artagnan
deserved reward.
The four had risked
our life and reputation by it.
One of his most dangerous enemy was
Cardinal Richelieu.
A formidable and ambitious man.
For the sake of power had even
betrayed and destroyed the Queen.
There was a man of honor.
His allies were Lady De Winter
Rochefort and his lover,
two wolves in sheep's clothing.
She would not forgive him
D'Artagnan and his lover Constance
having frustrated their conspiracy.
He wanted revenge.
A terrible woman.
But what mattered to us then
it Rochefort or Cardinal?
We were young and carefree,
Typical Musketeers.
D'Artagnan was in love
Fine dressmaker.
And we were very busy fighting
against the Protestants of La Rochelle.
We tried to teach the rebels
what is Christian compassion,
bombing them into submission.
These thugs with the idea of ??a
working class as a religion!
Even our old enemy
Rochefort spying for us.
With little luck, you see.
Fortunately for him and unfortunately for us,
we help you escape.
If it was for me,
we would have abandoned to their fate.
- This is enough for him.
- We did not know how many.
Lie.
Cojan rods load!
Sink the bullets!
Shake the rod load!
Go back to catch the muskets!
Light the wick!
Take away the soot!
Take away a musket insurance!
Have you prepared Porthos horses?
Yes.
Have you prepared the horses?
Yes!
Drop!
Place the muskets!
Perhaps you could close one eye.
Eleven muskets!
Take cover!
The bomb! Quick!
Open the look!
It has been off the wick!
Aim!
Fire!
Idiots!
Do not know or execute someone?
Go back to load!
Why do you trouble her?
At the end will finish dying of old age.
Add the horse, Rochefort!
Hurry!
- You arrive just in time!
- Who wants to rescue a spy?
Close the door when we come!
The door!
Yes, exactly.
Aramis!
Spend less!
Give now!
No, again! Come again!
I'd rather die than have to
bring you this news, Your Majesty.
The rebels hope to help
fleet of the Duke of Buckingham.
- I wish I were dead.
- Me too.
All of us.
- My life is in your hands, your Majesty.
- But I do not want it!
I do not want to hear those stories.
I want to get successful
in La Rochelle.
- The Duke of Buckingham Queen wishes.
- No, Your Majesty.
What he wants is La Rochelle
and will help the rebels.
But the Queen
not betray France.
- In France, no. But to me, yeah.
- But his Majesty is France.
Tell the rabble which leaves no
to storm La Rochelle.
The walls will collapse soon.
La Rochelle fall.
But it is tedious fight
day to day without success.
Majesty
Do you wish to continue here
the siege while his Majesty
returns to Paris with the Queen?
Let us do the dirty work.
Yes it's dirty job,
and Queen deceives me.
You should consider yourself lucky.
I risked life
of my Musketeers to rescue you.
Do not do it again.
With two eyes you'd see why.
I like it.
The gratitude of the nobles.
"Spy" is an ugly word.
At your service, Eminence,
that word sounds familiar.
Kneel down, miserable,
before your master!
Listen, Rochefort.
Unfortunately, the Queen
sends love letters to Buckingham.
While Buckingham
sends his fleet against France.
You'll keep these letters,
retaining the wearer.
Constance Bonacieux,
Queen's dressmaker.
Then remove it, my son.
But this time I'm not going to rescue.
At the end of the day is just a woman.
The goose is young, sir.
And repent.
I do not want.
My mother says that only well
can you tell if fresh.
Peaches!
Are not they beautiful?
Beside you, my dear Constance,
look old and wrinkled.
Melons!
Moron.
Who will now pay for this?
¿D'Artagnan?
D'Artagnan!
Take her away!
Get up and fight, you coward!
Poor, poor gentleman
Relay!
Metedlo in the carriage.
But with care.
It hurt.
But Constance ...
Quiet.
I'll take care of you.
He is a young
really handsome, Kitty.
- Are you awake?
- Who are you?
A friend.
Melons for Constance!
- I have to go!
- Do not be foolish.
I have to find Constance.
Please excuse me.
Such generosity to a stranger.
Lord!
Do not you feel good.
You should rest.
Should.
But now I have time.
But back
to thank you
accordingly.
A very handsome young man.
If I had my way,
would have bled to death in the street.
But you are a friend.
What if we knew
to her friend, the dressmaker?
So much beauty wasted
in a ridiculous musketeer.
I simply follow orders
Cardinal and entertain.
Is not that what you want the Cardinal?
And you as always
enjoy your work.
What do you think, Lord Buckingham?
God would have given us wings,
if he wanted to nadásemos.
To end the siege of
La Rochelle, we should take boats.
Well ...
Your submarine
is a great invention,
but how much meat in salt
can lead to the rebels?
How many weapons can you carry
Richelieu to end?
Here we are!
But the submarine is sufficient
to steal the Queen of France.
- I do not need to steal the Queen of France.
- No.
When the time comes,
waiting for you.
My dear sweet Anne ...
Those damn priests!
Those damn Protestants!
Three weeks enduring the rain
in La Rochelle, and for what?
My best dressed
still on the way to Paris.
These religious wars. Beatrice,
I'm losing patience!
- Majesty, perhaps this ...
- No!
With that look like a pillow exploded.
Constance will
make me a new one. Where is it?
- Where is the Queen's dressmaker?
- Your Majesty, we can not find it.
What do you mean?
Two days ago nobody
have seen here or at home.
Has disappeared.
Cardinal.
What have you done with it?
But where? Where?
You say he has been kidnapped? Given ¿
your nose? And there were only four?
Losing a lover
normally it's terrible,
but her that they take
tucked in a basket
is nonsense and almost tasteless.
Especially if you already have the
interest of another beautiful girl!
Poor Madame Bonacieux
she prefers to be
with the kidnappers.
If It treats me to mine and ...
Aramis! Aramis!
Look at my new trick mortal!
My enemy will unsheathe the sword,
when suddenly ...
Oh, Porthos!
Try again!
Porthos only invent new ways
to disarm itself.
When will you learn?
Why would kidnap her?
I do not even listen.
- It was a scientific experiment!
- Are you hurt, Athos?
No, I'm drunk.
You are wounded,
concerned.
You're really worried.
What?
- My lover has been kidnapped in my presence ...
- Well.
Do you know where they hide?
- No.
- Well!
- I hear you have a new lover.
- No!
Porthos has told me.
Do Porthos perhaps a liar?
No.
He talked about an aristocrat
with which you are viewing.
No, no!
To her I love her head.
But my Constance I was robbed,
I love her with all my heart.
Who would have thought you were going to
steal the heart so easily.
Old drunk!
Do you ever stolen your heart?
Me? No.
Never. I met a man who
was stolen. But not me, ever.
Listen to this love story.
There was once a man.
A noble
who stole his heart. He loved
a girl who had nothing.
But it was the most beautiful
you can imagine.
He was a man of honor.
He could have taken no further.
But he was a man of honor.
So he married her.
Not knowing where it came from.
He gave his name,
his fortune and his love ...
... honorably.
One day, hunting,
she fell off the horse
and he saw
her bare shoulder.
He saw the stigma of a prostitute.
He had before him a thief.
His angel bore his name and at the same time
the mark of disgrace.
Prostitute, killed or worse.
Marked on the shoulder.
He ..
I had seen.
He ..
What?
I think she is ...
... Dead.
Hope is dead.
Do not you wish you were him?
Poor man.
Poor man dishonored.
Well!
This story
should be cured of love.
You need a love story
to heal.
Of fascinating women.
Tell me something. Is your lady
as beautiful as the dew?
It's so beautiful
as dew in summer. So beautiful.
Please forget it.
It will bring bad luck.
You're right.
In addition, I owe it to Constance.
I will be faithful.
- Lord D'Artagnan!
- Kitty! How is your wife?
- Good, but not here.
- Is not it? But if he said at four.
- He left before four to take the air.
- Is the air?
Why the hell does that?
That pretty flower!
She does not love you at all.
Is that what you say?
No. But I've seen
my wife with other men.
But why tell me?
- Because I have my own interest.
- Do you?, Do you Kitty?
But of course.
¿Sure, I could expect?
My dear girl.
We have ten minutes
before my wife again.
We're here.
Thank you very much, Milady.
Damn arm.
¿Kitty?
- He has gained weight.
- Why not buy a horse?
¿Kitty?
Kitty!
- Were Sleeping?
- I was resting.
Thank you.
- Has been our Gascon and is off again?
- No, Milady.
He has not come.
May have had
to go with the army to La Rochelle.
We may have to teach
Monsieur D'Artagnan manners,
get rid of it before.
- What will you do with it, Milady?
- Who knows?
I'm flattered to be adored
by a handsome man.
Rochefort end up making you apart.
Maybe I should see it.
In her dressmaker ...
are responsible for the followers of Rochefort.
Tonight I put this.
Wait!
Thank you!
No. ..
Where is Constance Bonacieux?
- Fast! Or this bed will become your deathbed.
- Wait, wait.
Please try and make you
stigma around the body!
- Fast, Kitty! Give me that coat!
- Kitty! Open the door!
But ...
Excuse me, sir.
Wait! Come back here!
Kitty opens the door!
I think your lady calls.
But there ...
Hello, hello.
Hey.
- Thank you.
- Continue, please.
Kitty!
Very good.
Kitty! Open the door!
Bad luck, Aramis!
Shine! Do you want someone who
will wipe the boots? ¿You, sir?
¿To wash boots?
- D'Artagnan! Lend money!
- Wine!
I need more wine!
Ah, thank you.
Where did you get that?
Milady.
Your story,
the collar, stigma ...
Was it?
My God.
He hoped she was dead.
It belonged to my family for several
generations, until I gave it.
- They have not found out, okay?
- If
So it has come back to haunt me.
And you too.
Never forgive you.
You know his secret.
Kill you.
You've tried.
Now go.
Go to Paris, go to France.
Get away from it all possible.
Do you?
I'm safe.
She does not know that there Athos.
If you stay, your life will be worthless.
Do you understand?
No. You forget
I have to find Constance.
That clumsy seamstress!
Watch out! I love her.
Or I think so.
I will ask the Queen
help us find her.
As regards
stigmatized the lady and her revenge:
Our regiment moves tomorrow
to La Rochelle. Far enough.
- Where are you going, musketeer?
- To see the Queen.
His Majesty receives none,
but will be happy to Cardinal.
D'Artagnan of Gascony.
They say you are a swordsman.
I halagáis.
- A conspirator.
- Everyone has something about it.
- An enemy.
- It is my honor to have you as an enemy.
Me?
I have no enemies.
Only in France.
But I seem to be surrounded by
enemies carrying your emblem.
You also bear my emblem.
You serve to France, just like me.
Accept a job on my watch.
Those enemies
are enemies of France.
Averiguad who they are.
Take my emblem.
Accept my appreciation.
Eminence, what I can say?
A "yes" would suffice.
I can not.
You're soaked.
Wet or not, I can.
- Give me your hand. Your fortune is assured.
- No, I can!
I will not withdraw my hand.
I am offering the.
It is your future.
Give me your hand!
No.
- Are you going to the siege of La Rochelle?
- Yes
It is a dangerous journey.
I wish you no harm,
- But I can not protect you.
- Not me I have asked you.
Do not move a finger to save you.
I am very sorry to
accept your offer.
I do not make an offer
twice in one day.
But if you return alive to Paris
could repeat it.
Because then
you would be an extraordinary young man.
Not fail to tell the tale.
Goodbye.
This young idiot
has rejected the offer of Richelieu.
That opens the season for you.
That boy cocky.
No!
We should make sure you have
a journey full of emotions.
That's an easy fix.
The Musketeers
and his regiment leave Paris tomorrow.
Serve as messengers
on their way to La Rochelle.
D'Artagnan and his friends travel
normally in small groups.
Should not be difficult
entertain during your trip.
Great. And the Bonacieux?
Enjoy the company of my
guards in the castle Saint-Cloud.
They strive to meet
their basic needs.
So it is in good hands.
Do not worry.
The Queen will need a new
seamstress as you say so.
What Saint-Cloud?
He will kill
my wife as desired.
And she will do anything
to get back at you.
The release you tonight.
- But where can go?
- In the convent of Armentières be secure.
But the men of Rochefort
await you.
Let us do so. This is what
least we can do for you.
She can stay with the sisters
while we are in La Rochelle.
I'm sure
they will have much to say.
I will remplazaré in gait and
we will meet within three days.
You try to comfort someone
until we return.
Aramis!
Forgive me!
The key!
Do not let the lame!
We need it!
Go to the window!
Hello, dear.
Would you get on my shoulders?
There he is!
Come, my dear. Here we are.
- Yes!
- Good morning, sister. Be good.
The siege of La Rochelle
has been very difficult.
Especially since no one obeys.
For example:
I would have raised
siege towers at dawn.
No, no. Before dawn.
- Good afternoon. Have you seen a musketeer?
- No, not yet.
On the table is a letter
for you. It arrived today.
Unfortunately, my superiors
not appreciate my strategy.
Love, your ...
What does it say?
The lyrics are almost
unreadable. Maybe you could ...
"Dear Monsieur D'Artagnan,
Knights Athos, Porthos and Aramis
were in my inn. "
The letter is dated Villoix innkeeper.
"They were so drunk they will
to spend a few days in jail.
They sent me to send you this wine
to provide for them. "
This I call true friendship.
Even drunk I think.
No. I pay the deposit
and we drink together.
But what have I done?
Who the hell
fight outside in this weather?
- Only a fool.
- Do you think that D'Artagnan has something to do with it?
Who else in this way?
That is why!
And this.
Do not worry. I'm coming. I help ...
- Take me with you!
- Get out!
Help me!
Are you hurt?
- No, no.
- Well, come on.
He still lives here.
Then we took.
We chat
on plans for the lady.
What about me?
I'm freezing!
- What do you think?
- Nothing.
We had to go to the inn
"Palomar red" near La Rochelle.
Oh, God, my arm!
I swear not a name!
Planchet!
- Brandy!
- Come on! Move!
Here is your wine.
This will help.
For the love of God,
Give me something to drink.
Do I have to die I thirst and cold
while the baby robber?
- Have you gone crazy?
- There you go!
I never liked that crop.
- Where did this come out?
- You guys have sent!
Villeroy came from the inn.
- We have not sent any wine.
- But we know who has.
An ambush on the road.
Poisoned wine.
It appears that Milady is tenacious.
The sooner we get to the field
Battle of La Rochelle, the better.
Posada "red Palomar."
- To me they are disgusting.
- But please, try one.
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Spirit.
Sight
these sinners who hang here.
Cardinal!
- La Rochelle has fallen, right?
- Not at all, Your Majesty.
The pigeon has arrived
the pigeon, Eminence.
Eminence!
Yes, it's here.
Or the luck is on your side,
or you cheat.
- It's a matter of faith.
- Your faith costs me money.
Every afternoon in this place, only
because this rogue has appointed him.
What are we waiting?
Richelieu!
What the hell is he doing here?
- So no one knows you're here?
- The host has been well paid.
In any case, Milady.
To charge shall do the following:
A ship waiting at the mouth.
Embarcad tonight. In London
shall pray to the Duke of Buckingham
that does not support the rebels.
No food,
no help, no English fleet.
If it still supports them,
go to war with France,
a war that can not win.
Addition,
Queen of France,
at which the both appreciates,
will be put into evidence and dishonored,
I give you my word.
What if you listen to?
Then we must pray
that the Duke has an accident.
I understand.
Of course, we advise
take the right decision.
Bon voyage, Milady.
I do not want money as a reward.
No?
I have matters to settle.
Your issues do not interest me.
It is my desire.
Your desires do not interest me.
But of course you can
you set the same price.
A death.
I will not help you
in your private murders.
I need help.
I just need
your signature on a pass
to eliminate the harlot
Bonacieux and her lover.
No.
Eminence.
The death of Buckingham
for the death of D'Artagnan. Their lives
for the good of France.
- So?
- Seek D'Artagnan and stay with him.
Do you?
- I'll go when I can.
- Be careful.
What do you want? Who are you?
How dare you?
He was right.
You're still beautiful.
Count de la Fere!
Oh, no, milady.
The count of Fere has died.
Years ago I killed it.
Do you remember?
A hunt.
On a summer day.
I'm so stigmatized like you.
What do you want?
No longer binds us all.
Thank God.
But perhaps one thing we do.
I know you.
I know what has happened here.
Let me tell you something.
I do not care if you kill Buckingham.
Is an Englishman and an enemy.
But if you touch him
a hair of D'Artagnan,
I swear I will kill you
with my own hands.
No.
Monsieur D'Artagnan
attacked and insulted me ...
Since when can you insult?
... and die for it.
Have you ever seen a woman
shot in the stomach?
I know, Milady.
Give me the letter from the Cardinal.
I give you five seconds.
All right.
One, two,
three, four ...
"On my orders
and for the sake of our state
has done what he has done
the bearer of this letter. Richelieu. "
Very clever and witty,
Cardinal.
It gives you what you want
without incriminating.
Unfortunately you have no time to
inform you before your departure.
Have a good trip.
In the outer bastion
are not rebels.
But we will not endure.
It's only seven.
At nine we will
a frontal attack. Or at ten.
- A musketeer! Where have you been?
- Good morning, gentlemen.
Shine! Come, quick!
- What is it, handsome?
- Let me! Obsessed!
Thank you very much.
Where is the Gascon?
We need to talk to him.
There, in the trench.
A meeting? But where?
Here nothing is secret.
The Cardinal has eyes and ears
everywhere.
Right. Where can we go?
We had much to do.
And where were the musketeers?
We prayed for you.
I also have.
In the bastion
was like being in a hive.
However,
you have not been to breakfast.
You would have done neither.
What bet?
I bet more ...
I bet the best of dinners
to breakfast in the bastion.
And now.
I agree.
- Have you heard, Spengler. We're going to eat the two of us.
- What happens?
Athos has been proposed that kill us
up there for breakfast.
Planchet! Bring bread, four chickens,
ham, oysters and wine. Right now!
Instead of wine, take champagne.
What for breakfast? My dear Porthos!
- Planchet! Money, money, money ...
- You you can afford!
- Thistles!
- A little far for breakfast!
Is not that right, Athos?
There! Is it that you are blind?
Someone approaches the stronghold! Fire!
Hurry! I cover you! Quick!
There!
Be careful, Planchet!
All right?
Why the attacks
are always uphill?
I'm getting old.
- I have to tell you something important!
- You have to speak up!
You three id up there!
And all three of you so prepare yourselves!
Finally we can talk in peace.
Here tennis your wine, sir.
It's an ideal temperature.
Come Planchet, open it now!
Cursed Pirate innkeeper!
This is not champagne!
The wine will not bear transportation.
Have you seen the cardinal?
And you want to kill Buckingham?
If necessary. And from what I know
Buckingham, will be necessary. Bring!
One moment, gentlemen!
We are eating breakfast!
They have no manners, these infidels.
- We can not allow!
- Why? He is on his side.
Exactly! And is English!
No! It is a brave and honorable
who love our Queen.
I will not let die
into the possession of ...
She also has condemned you to death,
to you and Madame Bonacieux.
Here, read it while you eat breakfast
and then hide it well in the boot.
Fire!
Failed.
It would be better to strangle Milady
to shoot these devils Protestants.
Why kill them, why sing
French and us in Latin?
Porthos, is that you know nothing?
What do you think is a religious war?
Here they come!
Come on, every shot a hit!
Hurry, Planchet!
Re-load!
Come Planchet.
Use both hands!
A loaf of bread!
Mine!
What a waste!
Forgiveness.
Quick, come! The Wall!
Pushing force! Pushing force for your lives!
Sorry, gentlemen.
Push, Porthos! Be strong!
- Athos! I have to tell the Queen of Buckingham!
- Later!
I suggest we go!
Take!
Thank you very much.
Could you give me a hand?
Can you help?
Shopping.
Can you?
Seguidles!
Come back soon. Safely.
Back and pagans,
or we will find you.
We will never see them.
- Here we are.
- Well done, D'Artagnan. And Athos, come.
It goes against our
principles, but toast!
And Aramis! You too. Well done.
Here's money.
Be filled with the stomach.
Your journey has been in vain.
Tell him or her threats
or convince me your beauty.
I help the Protestants
La Rochelle.
Tell him to the Cardinal.
I do not think that you may live to
repent, Lord Buckingham.
He was sure that Cardinal
exhaust every diplomatic option.
Now I am completely determined
to help the rebels.
He communicated to His Eminence.
Do not you notify anyone.
You came as an ambassador,
but you remain as murderous.
- No you will boldly.
- Oh, no?
A week in a room
overlooking the sea in the tower.
When navigating with my fleet to
France, you also navegaréis.
To the colonies of the King in America.
America!
They say they are
full of wild-looking.
Once there, perhaps you succeed
Use your beauty
for someone to bring you home.
But until then,
no illusions for yourselves.
Your jailer not see the beauty
however extraordinary it is.
You can not soften. Felton!
¿Milord?
Milady leads to the tower.
It is under your supervision.
No one else can see it.
¿Good man?
Could you comfort me in this place
with the word of God?
A Bible. And the Psalms.
Are not you Catholic?
No.
No, sir.
I Huguenot.
They condemn us for our faith.
This is mine.
Tomorrow will bring the Psalms.
God bless you!
Does the Cardinal
that woman has sent to England
to kill?
Oh, no.
We must warn you!
- Go and tell, D'Artagnan!
- I can not go!
The spies of the Cardinal
are everywhere.
But our messenger could
take a letter to Lord Buckingham.
- I am indebted to you.
- No, Your Majesty.
Majesty the King is waiting!
I have good news.
Constance is safe.
It is in the convent of Santa Cecilia,
near Armentieres.
Then end the siege,
the take back to Paris.
Lady, the King!
Salvadle for me.
God bless you.
And tell the messenger
to hurry.
This is the best
I could get for the money.
Do not let your foot be moved;
or numb the ...
Lord is your protector;
The Lord is thy shade upon thy right ...
The sun shall not smite you by day,
nor the moon by night.
Lord shall preserve thee from all evil;
He saved your life.
Jehovah

... now and forever.
Lift my eyes unto the hills:
Where does my help come from?
My help cometh from the Lord,
who made heaven and earth.
Do not allow your foot
nor slumber that keepeth thee ...
Lift my eyes unto the hills:
Where does my help come from?
My help cometh from the Lord,
who made heaven and earth.
Lift my eyes unto the hills:
Where does my help come from?
My help cometh from the Lord,

Behold, he is numb ...
Lord shall preserve thee from all evil;
He saved your life.
When they cry,
the Lord
listens
and delivers them from all their troubles.
The Lord is near ...
Amen.
Master Felton.
For two nights I do not sleep.
Wake up I'm closer to God.
God will sail while you sleep, Milady.
Help me!
God, help me! Help to mine
not to be condemned!
Deliver them of the traitor, the antichrist,
so as not to corrupt and destroy
as it has corrupted and destroyed
to me. Send me an angel
to destroy your enemies!
Help me! Help me!
Who is the antichrist, traitor?
Your master, the Duke of Buckingham.
He is the Philistine cursed Israel.
Thou art Puritan
and still serve him.
- In La Rochelle die for their faith and betrays them.
- No!
- No! He will save them.
- He deceives the world and will betray.
He goes to Paris to meet
Catholic Queen with her lascivious.
Help me, master Felton.
Vos tennis eyes of a saint.
Help me to warn our people.
I can not think.
Help me.
Felton,
can not stop this betrayal
unpunished.
- Your destiny is in God's hands. His will be done.
- Yes
So be it.
Then the dragon
was enraged against women;
and went to make war
the rest of her offspring.
Say ten pence.
Is steel good, hard as ivory.
Your change, sir. Its back!
Lord Buckingham!
Seems that Lord Buckingham
not going to leave England.
Congratulations.
Reek of England and to Calvinism.
The issues
Cardinal is fixed.
Now I take care of mine.
I'm going to St. Cloud to see Bonacieux.
No. It is in the convent
Santa Cecilia in Armentieres.
One of my men has followed
but it has spoiled.
Sorry.
- And D'Artagnan?
- La Rochelle surrendered three days ago.
So La Rochelle has fallen.
And not in time.
- What you going to spend, Porthos?
- After paying the drink
Athos and Aramis pardons,
will not be too much.
Do not forget the needy.
Come on. Constance is in danger!
Are on their way to Armentières
to pick up her lover.
Do not worry,
can not be beyond Paris.
We may be
in Armentières at dawn.
Twelve of our men are already there
to give
Welcome to D'Artagnan.
And ye have to all, Milady.
Welcome,
welcome, Musketeers!
The poor animals
are exhausted, Athos.
Not only the poor animals.
- How much is left to the monastery of Santa Cecilia?
- Two miles!
Following the road to Brussels.
We're almost there, boy.
Time for a glass of wine!
Then we accompany you to
your loved one. Wine! Come, come!
So reassure us.
Hey, stop!
Faster!
Athos!
Athos! It's here!
Rochefort! I have seen! Come on!
Let us follow him!
Come on! Hurry!
Sigámosles!
Sigámosles! Quick!
The horse has no seat, sir!
There they are!
Easy!
There is another entrance.
Bring them in! Go to the barn!
We are! Stop!
Look for the girl!
I take care of the riders!
Here they come! Here they come!
Fire!
They come from behind!
Do not let them escape! Fire!
Aramis!
Fire!
Thank you!
Come on, Rochefort!
Come!
- Aramis!
- Porthos!
Aramis!
Quick!
... Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil ...
What happened?
My dear girl.
Do not be afraid. Keep praying.
- The shooting ...
- ... soon be over.
I'm a friend.
Soon you will be free.
- Monsieur D'Artagnan ...
- Are here!
Next comes.
End of praying.
Pray also for him.
- And his brave men.
- Yes
- You really are here, sister?
- And will not leave without you.
So ...
I expect you.
"Only Porthos invent new ways
to disarm itself. "
Out of here!
Do not cry, little girl.
You have to be pretty
for D'Artagnan.
Yes.
- Why is it always my turn?
- You're getting old.
Where is Rochefort?
We have not seen.
Constance!
Constance!
Where will you go will not need
no horse.
I warned you.
I advise you to run
to save your life.
Murderer!
Damn!
Stop! Stop fighting!
We are here as judges.
What is your verdict?
Death penalty.
Death penalty
Death penalty.
Death penalty.
Vos the estigmatizasteis then.
As earl Fère and
authority granted to me,
- Condemn this woman to death.
- I want five doubloons.
D'Artagnan!
No!
No! You are not my judges.
Take me to a judge!
No!
One more step, D'Artagnan,
and our swords will cross.
I swear to God
this time going to die!
Two more doubloons row.
I'm executioner, not a sailor.
Monsieur D'Artagnan.
Your Sword! Yours too!
On behalf of Cardinal!
On one occasion
I held out my hand.
This time I will not.
This time you are accused of murder
a servant of the state.
I fought with their own weapons.
And you won.
Also against Rochefort. Not bad.
But your victories are expensive.
For me and for France.
I extend the hand of France
to get paid.
I will not pay a penny, or
shed a tear, not to repent.
Then you judge and condemn.
I think not.
I have a pass to all.
¿Signed by whom? The Queen can not,
King would not.
For you, Your Eminence.
Why me?
"On my orders
and for the sake of our state,
has done what he has done
the bearer of this letter. "
One must be careful
what you write.
And who delivers it.
I have to remember.
This makes you real musketeer.
Name is missing,
but I give it to you.
Your friends are also free.
Good morning, Monsieur D'Artagnan.
Athos,
Cardinal has given me this.
I can not accept.
Should be for you.
To the Count de la Fere is little,
for Athos too.
You deserve it, boy.
Aramis, dear friend.
You have education and studies.
You should have it.
You forget that I
I am only a Musketeer provisionally.
Whenever I get time
ordain me priest.
- Look at me, please! How do I have?
- Well,
- But that you would be much better.
- Lieutenant!
I'm flattered, but I will not.
One has to wonder
if such a position is for a gentleman.
Would lose my friends!
A lieutenant can not go
with private Musketeers.
Even with those who
helped when I was young and foolish.
When run over to all
to fight a duel,
was ridiculous,
struggled with the guards
Cardinal as his friends,
older and wiser, trying
stop him and him away from trouble.
Oh, how we help
to take his first steps!
We teach the rules
high society.
We aleccionamos in all the arts
a young gentleman should know.
We protected him against enemies
and temptations of this wicked world.
What would become of him without us?
Or we be without him?
So it really was:
"One for all and all for one".
