Dash! Dash!
Dash!
Oh, shit.
Cover me!
Miller!
Is that it?
Project 725.
If you provide a server
powerful enough,
the A.I. will run off this.
So small, yet so powerful.
This...
is how we change the world.
Need some help up here, hurry!
Miller!
Don't leave me!
You did it.
Good job, good job.
Boy.
Derek Miller.
- Donovan Chalmers.
- Pleasure.
Welcome to Chapter House.
I read up on you.
Impressive stuff.
Just doing my duty.
Spoken like
a true soldier.
Well, it takes one
to know one, right?
Ah, you did your homework.
Yes, sir.
It's not every day you get
to meet a ground and pounder
turned CEO.
75th Regiment,
Task Force Ranger...
B Company.
Mogadishu?
Mogadishu,
Somalia, Bosnia...
Iraq.
Quite the career change.
Why the switch?
Hm.
Family life...
changes everything.
Yeah.
Your refrence spoke
very highly of you.
Is that right?
And who was it that referred me?
I did, you son of a bitch.
Fox! Look at you.
Uh-oh.
"Suits and ties
are for pussies."
Oh, man.
Maggie wanted me out of the game
while I still had all my limbs.
- Wives.
- Yeah, tell me about it.
She made me sell
my soul for a fancy 401(k).
- Looking good.
- Thank you, brother.
- It's good to see you.
- You too.
- Right.
- Hey, Fox...
Yes, sir?
Walk Derek
through the proposal.
I'm sure you recognize
your old friend,
the Pardoner.
The terrorist revolutionary
who's been raising hell
all over the globe
for the past two years.
How could I forget him?
He put a bullet
in my back.
Still have the scar
to prove it.
What's this have to do
with Chapter House?
Last week,
the Pardoner stole
a piece of Chapter House
technology.
A piece of proprietary tech that
we do not need in hands like his.
Why's that?
Could be bad.
"Could be bad?"
Bad for who?
Bad for you?
Bad for everyone.
Flight 314...
Crashed off the coast,
no survivors.
Now, we have reason to believe
that the Pardoner is liable.
Now, fortunate for us,
we put a fail-safe on the
trigger of the device,
just in case
for circumstances like this.
That's good, right?
Yeah...
but there's only one man
that has the code to decrypt it.
And now that man is
a high-value target.
That man is me.
The board put a trip
on the books for Mr. Chalmers
to check out a site
for a new factory.
Now, it's an old warehouse
that they're dying to tear down,
but we need to act fast.
Tax incentives,
credits, rebates...
Billions on the line.
So, what?
You want me and my team
to babysit you?
Come on.
Hey. This is a lay-up.
Okay, maybe nothing happens,
but you and your team,
you go in,
you go home
with an easy payday.
Or maybe...
Maybe you get another chance to go
another round with the Pardoner.
I don't know, Nick.
We don't usually
do security detail.
Come on.
I need you on this one.
Can't you call in
some favors?
Get a couple more
teams involved?
The Pardoner is a former Tier-1
turned radical.
His influences run deep.
Now, we can't risk
the possibility of infiltration.
I can trust you.
I can't say the same thing
about my other contacts.
Remember Darfur?
I'm the one
that saved your ass.
I figured you owe me
on this one.
Chapter House has
unlimited resources.
We're prepared to offer you
a very lucrative contract.
Lots of zeroes, buddy.
Lots of zeroes.
Okay.
If we do this,
we do it my way.
You clue me in
on everything.
And everything
goes through me.
No questions asked.
Then you'll do it?
Yeah.
Uh, Crystal,
can I have two beers?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
What'd you do last night?
A little bit of laundry.
- Party girl.
- Yeah.
You got anything
for tonight planned?
Washing the dog.
Okay.
All right, well,
I'll catch you later.
Have fun with your dog.
Your usual, honey?
Yes, please.
Club soda with lime.
Thank you.
What's wrong?
You seem down.
Just stuff.
What's up, buddy?
Nice to see you.
Dude, do you think
I should talk to her?
- Her?
- Yeah.
Oh, absolutely.
You can't let a girl like that
drink by herself now, can ya?
Uh...
What do you think...
Listen, listen.
That's not just some girl.
That's a woman.
A real woman.
Now, you be brave.
And you slide
right over there,
you look her
in the fucking eyes,
you kiss her.
All right?
Chicks love that shit.
Go get 'em, big guy.
- There you go!
- Fuck it!
You are an asshole.
This should be interesting.
Hey...
Ooh.
Don't you fucking put your hand on me.
Jesus, Sasha.
Really, Dash?
Let him go, Sash.
Fuck.
We've got business to discuss.
Look, I know
I'm asking a lot.
Last time, we got our
asses kicked by the Pardoner.
We lost our VIP.
And if you remember correctly,
you almost came home
in a body-bag.
Is this some sort
of revenge thing?
That doesn't feel
like you, man.
It's a job.
Nothing personal.
Listen, I don't give a flying
fuck if you've got a score to settle.
This is a shit-ton of money
we're talking about here.
- That's right.
- Life-changing.
I'm in.
And what about you two?
You know, it's
"all for one and one for all."
Right?
I don't know. I feel like we're
not getting the full story.
And I want to know
what this Pardoner guy stole.
We all do.
But that ain't the job.
This is strictly
VIP protection.
Easy money.
But why the skeleton crew?
Wouldn't it make more sense
to have a presence?
I'm with Fox on this one.
You know,
going in with a full kit
could intimidate
the city council on site.
Might even look bad
for Chalmers, too.
Do we have to bring
the corporate stooge?
We go way back.
He's good in a fight.
Trust me.
All right.
If you want another shot
at the Pardoner,
I got your back, boss.
Look, you know I'd go anywhere to
bust some skulls with you guys.
But this thing ain't right.
Being rushed out there,
no prep...
Sasha, you can do this
if you want...
- I'm out.
- Harrison, you're right,
but this payday
is a game-changer.
Wouldn't you want
to spend the rest of the year
not getting shot at
for once?
I mean, think about it.
Come on.
Do it for me.
Fuck.
There we go.
See? That's what
brothers are for.
To keep their sisters
out of trouble.
Such a heartwarming moment.
All right. Crystal!
Another round of shots.
Hey, Crystal, make it two.
You buying?
We'll send the bill
to Chapter House.
I hear that.
- Hoo-ha!
- Hoo-ha!
What a shithole!
Not loving the spot, boss.
Lot of windows,
lots of places to hide.
Less time here,
the better.
Where's our rendezvous, Fox?
You said we were meeting
the building manager?
Mr. Chalmers?
Tell 'em.
There is no building manager.
There is no rendezvous.
- Fuckin' knew it.
- What the hell is this about, Fox?
The Pardoner.
- He's coming here.
- Hold on.
You knew the Pardoner
was coming
and you didn't bring
the fucking cavalry?
We are the cavalry.
A cavalry that's outmanned
and with limited firepower.
So, this was all a set-up?
We did what we had to.
Posing as civilians
was the only way
that we could get
a team in range.
This will work.
If the Pardoner saw us
come with the authorities
he may have pulled back.
It had to be
a small security team.
It had to be you, Miller.
Great. No service.
You guys are Chapter House,
can't you move a satellite or something?
Probably just the Pardoner
jamming the signals.
So we're bait.
No. You're not the bait.
I am.
Of all people...
I expected you
to understand.
When this is all over, you're gonna
see why it has to be this way.
You lied to me.
I had no choice.
I know you, Miller.
All you
ex-jarheads-turned-PMCs...
You're all the same.
You come back stateside
and still want to live the life,
but it's not about
God and country,
it's about how much money
you can make.
Well, you're getting paid.
So do your job.
You put my team in danger.
They have families, lives.
And you brought us here
unprepared.
After everything
we've been through.
Have any of you
checked your bank accounts?
Half the money up-front.
Just like you wanted.
We get out of this alive
and you get the other half.
It's not about the money.
Who wants to beat
the shit out of this guy?
Me. Anyone else?
- Gladly.
- I'll have a piece.
Come and get it.
Leave him alone.
It doesn't matter
how you got here.
If you want to survive,
we're gonna have to work together.
I just want to know why.
That son of a bitch
is using my daughter
to get to me.
You got kids, Miller?
You'd do anything for 'em.
Right?
Right now,
my baby's in trouble.
We got a fight
coming to us.
And Harrison's right.
We're outmanned, outgunned.
But the fight's still coming...
whether we like it or not.
Let's get you someplace safe.
This'll do.
Still know how to use this?
Don't worry about me, soldier.
Just go get my little girl,
all right?
No matter what happens,
don't open this door.
Miller, please.
We'll get your daughter.
I promise.
I know you will, Miller.
Anything happens
to my team,
I'm coming after you.
Wouldn't have it any other way.
Let's move.
Time to shake off
the rust, buddy.
Come in.
Come in.
We've lost connection
with our scouts.
Apparently, Chalmers and his
friends are more resourceful
than we thought.
Time for a new strategy.
I hope you're ready.
We're moving.
Eyes on how many?
Hard to say.
I count ten.
Maybe more.
Too much cover out there.
Layered attacks.
They'll come in waves.
They'll save the big attack
for when we get desperate.
You know...
I hate to say, I told you so.
A check that big and that fast,
there's always strings attached.
I let my friendship with Fox
get the better of me.
You know what? Fuck 'em.
Money already hit our
bank accounts.
Let's just make a run for it.
Let Fox and his boss
- fend for themselves.
- No.
No.
But I'm not doing this
for Fox or Chalmers.
It's hard to look
a man in the eye
who asks for help to save
his family and tell him no.
Besides, we don't run
from fights.
Hooo-rah.
That must be Eva.
Come on.
It's Eva.
We've gotta get her now.
Hey, hey.
Look...
Give me some cover
fire and I'll grab her.
Slow down.
The Pardoner is smart.
That's exactly what he wants.
So, what, we're just gonna
let her stand there?
No.
Eva, are you okay?
Who are you?
Nicholas Fox.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean for any
of this to happen.
I just wanted to test
it in the field.
What's she talking about?
Look, none of that
matters right now. Okay.
We've all come to
bring you home.
My dad isn't here, is he?
Please tell me that
my dad isn't here.
It was the only
way to get you.
Me?
Or Project 725?
Enough!
Nice to see you again, Miller.
How's the back?
Seven pounds.
That's the amount of pressure
required to pull a trigger.
Just like that.
It's all over.
Look, you leave her
out of this, okay?
If you want Chalmers, you
come and get him, bitch.
In due time.
My men fight for a cause,
for a purpose.
For a New World Order.
We know what's at stake.
Do you?
When your men learn the truth,
will they stay by your side?
Will you stay, Derek?
And what truth is that?
That you're a psychopath?
This facility is a security
nightmare.
Lots of ways in.
Hard to protect.
Just remember.
We have all the weaponry,
all the manpower.
And all the leverage.
Now, I'm giving you one hour
to bring me Chalmers
and the code to Project 725,
or it's going to get messy.
No, hey!
Not now.
I'll see you soon, Miller.
Did you find her? Is she okay?
She's alive. For now.
What's Project 725?
Tell me.
Look I told both of you, that
if I was gonna take this job,
I needed to know everything.
And all I keep hearing
is lie after lie.
Tell me what
the fuck's going on.
Project 725 is an artificial
intelligence system.
Not just an A.I. system.
It's a quantum A.I.
Wait, you cracked a two-state
quantum system?
How about we cut the geek-speak.
It's binary on steroids.
What? I subscribe to
TechCrunch.
It was my daughter's project.
Fresh out of MIT.
And she built something
way beyond me.
And then she stole it.
Eva...
Eva was confused.
Angry about a lot of things.
She's just got too
much of me in her.
So you tried to take the A.I.
from her, but instead
she brought it to the Pardoner.
The board.
They just saw the
project differently.
Very differently.
And here we are.
Yeah.
Here we are.
I know you're upset.
You came to me for help.
You wanted me to help
you change the world.
That's what I'm doing.
I reached out to you
because I wanted to test
Project 725 in the field.
To prove that it worked.
To prove that it would
help people.
And you promised me that.
And you lied.
That is exactly what I'm doing.
We are fighting
for the same cause.
Why do you not see that?
You wanna use your technology
to fix society.
To fix what is already sick.
We have the opportunity to make
real change, but in order
to find a cure for the sickness,
we have to know the cause.
Greed is the root of all pain.
Of all suffering,
of all evil.
Pharmaceutical companies enhance
their drugs to become
more addictive.
Politicians are lining their
pockets while homeless people
flood the streets.
I am not the bad guy.
I am a saint
compared to the pain and misery
they cause every second,
of every minute of every day.
You wanna find a cure for this
sickness, I am telling you
what it is.
With the code from Chalmers,
we can burn it.
Burn it all to the ground.
Aren't you tired
of being a pawn?
Time's up. Send them in.
Courtesy of our recently
deceased friends.
Nice.
Even with the extra guns
and ammo,
it's gonna be a tough fight.
And the sun's
going down fast,
so they'll be knocking on our
door before we know it.
Derek.
It's okay, we got it.
This isn't your fault.
Yeah, I'm not so sure
about that.
I talked you all into this.
Actually, I'm pretty sure it was
the gold-covered carrot
they dangled.
Which you all agreed on.
Guys, we all decided
to come, remember?
Look, still got your back, boss.
Well, if we're gonna survive,
we gotta be nimble.
Use the location to our
advantage.
We'll never make it through the
night if we take them head-on.
Let's do this.
Where do you think
you're going, pal?
Let's go.
Come on, you sons of bitches.
Go.
Side and main entrances
are compromised.
Are you sure about this plan?
Are you doubting the cause?
No, it's just...
We're losing good men.
I feel their pain, but you know
what's at stake here.
Their sacrifices won't
be forgotten.
Trust me.
Take a few men and go
around the side entrance.
Signal when you're inside.
Copy that.
B team, let's roll out.
We're here, back entrance
of the sub-basement.
Let's go.
Time's up, Miller.
Where's Chalmers?
Hold your fire, or she dies.
How much is Chalmers
paying you, Miller?
How much is enough?
You're out here putting
your life on the line.
Your team's lives
on the line.
And for what?
Money?
More money.
You are sheep.
You are slaves to a machine.
You're slaves to those
who run it all
for their mass profits,
while you cling to the pennies
that fall from their pockets.
I'm gonna make you
an offer, Miller.
Just put your weapons down
and fight with me.
You can have a seat at the table
and fight for something
that actually matters.
Fox!
Tear this place apart.
Fox.
Sasha, get down.
Listen to me. He wouldn't
want you dead either.
Let's go.
Come on.
Eva?
He's still alive!
Cover me!
Over there!
Eva, get down.
Hang in there, big guy.
Come on.
Over there.
What the hell
were you thinking?
I wasn't.
Hey.
Tell Maggie I'm sorry.
I just tried to get it in
one more time.
But I guess she was right.
I should have stayed my
ass behind the bench.
Hold it. Put pressure on it.
Come on.
Don't let that terrorist son of
a bitch find Chalmers.
You can't let him
start Project 725.
Promise me.
Miller.
Miller.
Boss, we gotta go,
it's getting hot out there.
Let's go.
Come on.
Fuck him. Let the bastard die.
He got Harrison killed.
If he hadn't lied to us
and manipulated you,
my brother
would still be alive.
That asshole got exactly
what he deserved.
Sasha.
Don't.
That's my brother's
dead body out there.
Mine.
You told me to trust you.
Harrison knew.
He knew this job was wrong
from the start.
And I talked him into it.
We all have his blood
on our hands now.
Especially you.
Hey... Hey,
where do you think you're going?
I'm not leaving him out there
for those animals.
That's suicide.
Listen, I would give you time,
but we don't have any.
Please.
Fine.
What's our next move?
Stay here.
I'm gonna go find Eva.
I can't believe this.
We'll be okay.
No.
Dad, what don't you get
right now?
I mean, this is my fault.
It's my fault.
You should've come to me
first, Eva.
I wanted to but I didn't
know what you would say.
You've never trusted me.
Sometimes I feel like
you loved your company
more than you loved
anything else.
If you ever thought that,
I'm sorry.
Well,
if we make it out of here,
I want you to tell me
why you still have
that ring on.
To remember.
Mom left you
a really long time ago, Dad.
Mistakes...
Really, lots of...
Many mistakes.
I can't let myself forget.
I guess we both have a hard
time letting things go.
Well, like father,
like daughter.
What was that?
- Get in.
- Are you serious?
Get in, yes.
Just trust me.
- Are you not coming?
- No, they need me.
Go, now.
Be careful.
Drop it, Chalmers.
If you kill me...
Project 725 is dead.
You're right.
I can't kill you.
That is gonna pale
in comparison
to what I do to you
if you don't give me
the code.
Pick him up.
Halt!
Still not talking?
It's all right.
Not quite finished
setting up yet, anyways.
Look Donovan...
Do you mind
if I call you Donovan?
You and I both know there's
nothing I can do to you
to make you
give me that code.
The more time you wait,
the more time I have
to find Eva.
And when I do,
I'm going to torture her.
And I'm going to make you
watch the entire thing.
You'll beg me
to use Project 725
by the time
I'm done with her.
I can promise you that.
You wanna torture somebody?
Torture me.
You leave her out of this.
Fuck this.
Over here.
Come on.
We're needed at base camp.
Oh...
Eyes on Dr. Chalmers.
North hallway.
We're closing in on her now.
Oh, it looks like
our guests are arriving early.
Don't underestimate
my daughter.
She's full of surprises.
Shh!
I'm not one of them.
Derek Miller.
- You're Fox's friend?
- That's right.
- I'm sorry.
- No time for apologies.
We gotta move.
All right?
- Okay.
- Come on.
Sir, we lost her.
She just vanished.
Please explain to me
how you lost her.
I keep saying, good help
ain't easy to find.
Are you hacked
into the cameras yet?
Almost.
Bringing up the live feed.
Wait a second.
She's... She's gone.
Explain to me
how that is possible.
I don't know.
It's like she just vanished
into thin air.
She vanished...
Find her!
And get me a new walkie.
No, no, whoa!
Hey, it's me.
Eva.
Tell 'em what you told me.
The Pardoner
has my father.
My dad
is one of the strongest,
most hard-willed men
that I've ever met.
But these last few days,
I've seen how dangerous the Pardoner is
and I've seen just how badly
he wants the access codes
to Project 725.
Please...
I don't know how much longer
my dad can hold off.
We can't let the Pardoner
control Project 725.
- We just can't.
- Why?
What's so fuckin' special
about this computer anyways?
When we created it,
I wanted to use it to
revolutionize the way that we live.
To help our government
run more efficiently,
our economy,
every aspect of society.
And it is more than capable
of doing those things.
I know that it can.
I tried to convince the board
to give me the funds
for a trial run.
My dad even backed me up.
They voted him down.
All they kept thinking about
was the money they could make
to flip it to the military.
They wanted to turn it
into a weapon.
Exactly.
I couldn't let them do that,
not after how hard
I'd worked
to bring about
something good.
I just kept thinking
if I could show them
the data,
if they could see it,
then they would understand.
Did you ever test it
in the field?
Once.
Flight 314.
The Pardoner
triggered the crash remotely
and got a taste
of its power.
Luckily, I was able to
stop him from going further
by initiating the fail-safe.
And what else does the
Pardoner want to do with it?
I wanted to save the world
with Project 725.
He wants to use it
to burn it to the ground.
What do you mean?
She means that he plans
on using the program
to wipe out everything.
Financial records, bank
statements, communications...
Jesus.
It would send us back
to the Stone Ages.
Exactly.
You see,
the Pardoner believes
that if he resets
everything to zero,
that that's the only way
that it will save society.
Wipe everything out,
start with a clean slate.
Unbelievable.
And the Pardoner
can do all this?
If your dad gives him
the fail-safe?
I've made a terrible mistake
and I realize that now.
This is a power
humanity is not ready for.
We're the only ones
that can stop him.
So I am begging you,
please help me.
It's been a long time
since we fought
for something
other than a payday.
But maybe that's why
we're here now.
Maybe that's why
all this shit happened.
This.
This is something
worth fighting for.
My brother died today.
This...
This is the fight
that Harrison would want.
He'd wanna stop
the Pardoner.
And that's what
I'm gonna do.
I'm all in, boss.
I'll do whatever it takes
to make that happen.
Dash?
How do you want
to play it, boss?
I know that you guys
are the experts,
but I have an idea.
When did you see
the schematics?
The Pardoner had blueprints.
He's been casing
this place for days
waiting for my dad.
So, you're drawing this
all based on memory?
It's a little crude
but it should give us
a good idea of the space.
The control room.
This is where the main power
to the building runs from.
Hard to run a computer
if we cut the power.
You think it will work?
It has to.
Clear!
Fan out! Eyes open!
Miller, hold there!
The control room's that way.
Okay, let's go. Move.
I see another one.
Shit!
Derek Miller.
Your resolve is impressive.
You truly do not know
when to quit.
It's admirable.
Stupid...
But admirable.
But did you really think
we wouldn't notice the
security cameras going out?
Look, I'm assuming
Dr. Chalmers is with you.
That's good.
My guards
are moving into position
so I'm gonna make you
a limited-time offer.
Hand her over to me
and you live.
You get to walk out.
You and your team, go on,
do whatever you wanna do.
I'll be waiting.
We gotta get off
his radar.
Any suggestions?
Yeah.
This way's clear.
They must've gone down there.
All clear.
Not too bad, Miller.
Got it?
Dash, Eva, you're up.
This is one complex
and out-of-date grid.
Yeah, it is.
All units,
converge on the generator room.
Any time now.
Try not to get
electrocuted, boss.
My
patience is wearing thin, Miller.
Just pull it.
My offer to
let you live is officially revoked.
- Come on, Dash.
- Just pull it.
Come on, they're coming.
Let's go!
Fuck it.
Well... Fuck.
All right.
What happened?
We lost all power.
Come out, you're surrounded!
Is something funny?
Can't figure it out?
Yeah.
It's gonna be, you know, pretty hard
to launch your little toy there.
Bring me the back-up
generator from camp.
Yes, sir.
On second thought...
I'm coming with you.
No more mistakes.
Okay, this is it.
We make our move while they're
distracted by the power.
- We nab Chalmers and get the hell out of here.
- Yeah.
But what about Project 725?
We leave it
with the bad guys?
They'll still be
coming after Chalmers.
I think I know
what to do about that.
Let's take it.
Sell it on the black market.
You can't do that.
Dash!
What the hell
are you doing?
Dash...
Money's not gonna bring
Harrison back.
No, but it won't hurt, either.
Call it hazard pay.
Dash, come on.
I can't let you
do this, man.
I'm sorry, Miller.
I gotta do this by myself.
Don't do this.
Dash, no!
- Dash?
- Dash!
Come on.
Dash!
Dash!
Dash!
Oh, shit! Take cover!
I don't know why you think
this is gonna end
any differently
than the last time
we met, Miller.
It's time for Eva
to go see Daddy
so he can give me the code.
Hold your fire.
I got what you want.
The money for the girl.
We got a deal?
Smart move, soldier.
Hand her over.
- We have a deal?
- Yeah, we got a deal.
Kill him. Go.
Cover me!
No! Dash.
- I'm not ready to die. Sash...
- Goddammit!
Oh, Jesus Christ!
You're hit.
Come on, we got to move! Now!
Some rescue, huh?
I told you to run.
You should know by now
I don't listen to you.
I told you
I'd find her, Chalmers.
Do you know why they
call me the Pardoner?
Anyone?
The Canterbury Tales.
Two Ivy League diplomas and no
one knows The Pardoner's Tale.
Once upon a time,
three men,
distraught over the death
of their friend,
form a pact
of brotherhood.
To seek out
and kill death.
A wise man tells them
death can be found
under the oak tree
in the grove.
When they arrive,
all they find...
is a pile of gold.
Two of the men
greedily kill the third
so they could split the
treasure between themselves.
Unfortunately,
after they kill
their friend,
they drink the wine
he'd poisoned
and they both die.
Some pact of brotherhood.
I'm just the wise man
pointing to the oak tree.
You're pretty sick,
aren't you?
Sick fucking terrorist,
that's what you are.
You like that?
All of my acts
of so-called "terror"
have been to level
the playing field.
When the generator
is running
and Project 725
is back online,
you're going to
give me the code.
What the...
What happened?
Fuck.
Just wrap me up.
Find me a gun
and let's fucking go.
I love your enthusiasm,
but you're not
going anywhere.
The fuck I'm not.
Hey! They know
our location.
It's only a matter of time
before they find us here.
And I'm not losing
anyone else tonight.
I'll draw their attention.
Keep them as far away
from here as I can.
When you think it's clear,
get the hell out.
I'll meet you back at the edge
of the road when it's all over.
No way.
This is all my fault.
But I'm gonna fix it.
This time I'm putting a
bullet in the Pardoner.
Put a second one in there
for me, too.
And for Harrison.
Hooah.
Hooah.
What about Eva
and Chalmers?
I told you I got this.
Um...
I know it may not mean
much now, but, uh...
for what it's worth,
I just want to say...
I'm sorry.
For everything.
Sir.
Generator is back online.
Here we are, Project 725.
Awaiting activation code.
You sure about this?
'Cause once we do this,
there's no going back.
That's the point.
A lot of innocent people
are going to die.
Two years...
we've spent working on this.
The time,
all of the resources,
all of the lives lost
would be for nothing.
If you don't want to be
a part of it, then say it.
Say it!
Say it!
I do.
I'm gonna give you
one last chance, Chalmers.
Give me the code.
Don't do it, Dad.
Yeah, Dad. Don't do it.
You're not gonna shoot her.
Not if you want the code.
You have no idea
what I will do.
You're only delaying
the inevitable.
Tell me!
Tell me, you motherfucker!
Now!
- Don't.
- Tell me the code.
No, Dad.
Dad, don't tell him.
Don't tell him.
Don't tell him.
Fine.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
- Don't tell him, don't.
- I'll do it.
I'll give you
the goddamn code.
Good.
It worked. We're in.
With the push
of a button...
everything changes.
So, what do we
destroy first?
Good question.
Why don't we let
the creator pick?
You wanted
to change the world.
Now's your chance.
Pick.
Fuck you.
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Come in.
Come in.
Come in.
How
many men you got left, Pardoner?
Two? One?
The answer is none.
You're dead, Miller.
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.
Let's play.
Fuck this.
I'm here, Miller.
Let's finish this.
Man-to-man.
Come here.
Where do you think
you're going?
You got any more
fancy words to say?
I'm done talking.
Come on.
- Eva, you're not able...
- Maybe we can salvage it.
No, no. You want
to change the world?
This is how.
Oh, I can't lose
this research.
We have to destroy it.
The board will fire
you from your own company.
So what?
We'll start our own company.
Eva... please.
It takes both
our fail-safes.
- You're right.
- Okay.
All right.
Eva, let's do this.
- Ready?
- Ready?
Come on.
I got your back, soldier.
Hey.
You okay?
Do I look okay?
Harrison...
would be proud.
Fuck you.
I've got a helluva
worker's comp claim.
So, what now?
Retirement sounds pretty
fucking good right about now.
Yeah.
I don't know
about you guys,
but I can use
one last drink.
Well, it better be
on Chapter House.
I think
I can arrange that.
Yeah, I'm good.
Well, who's driving?
Not me.
Do you see
this fucking arm?
