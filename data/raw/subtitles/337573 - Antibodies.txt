"IF THERE IS NO GOD...
...EVERYTHING IS ALLOWED."
FYODOR MIKHAILOVICH DOSTOEVSKY
The world is unfair. Even to people like us.
Pedro Alonso López,
"The Monster of the Andes",
committed 300 sex murders.
Now, 20 years later, who remembers him?
Not a soul.
Jack the Ripper is world-famous,
and for what? Five bitches. Five!
And Charlie Manson?
That hippie they called "Our Emperor", but
he didn't even commit one murder himself.
POLICE
Hello?
- Police. You called?
- Finally! My God.
Up there.
That's where the screams came from.
- Is Bosowski here yet?
- Wouldn't you know it if he was?
Make sure he doesn't show up too soon.
I'll bet 10-to-1
that this jerk-off is our jerk-off.
Move away, we're taking over now!
Come on!
Lights!
Behind you!
I got you, jerk-off.
I'm innocent.
I'm innocent.
What are you doing?
- Are you going hunting?
- Why are you up already?
What is this?
You're 13 years old.
- It won't happen again.
- Finish up before your mom gets up.
You said I could come.
Not this time.
Schimanski!
HERZBACH
A HAPPY PLACE
ANTIBODIES
Schimanski!
- Who's that?
- That's Holy Saint Michael.
There you are,
thinking there's no evil in the world.
Stupid animal!
Well?
They're keeping out of sight.
All right. Why are we here?
I was talking to Rosa.
I hate to see my daughter cry.
I'm a good husband.
Anyway, it's no business of yours.
Wrong!
Everything is my business.
And you treat her badly.
That's not true.
- I can't imagine she told you that.
- I have eyes in my head.
Listen, boy.
- I know Rosa is starting to show her age.
- Is that why you wanted to talk?
I heard you want us all
to give saliva samples.
- Who told you that?
- Is it true?
- It's an idea...
- Oh, really, "an idea".
How long will you keep telling people
that there's a sick murderer among us?
- Until I know there's not.
- One and a half years without a clue.
Now you crown your incompetence
by planning to humiliate us all.
- I'm just doing my duty.
- Oh, we should be grateful
that God sent such an upright person
to our small community.
It's too late anyway. I have authorization.
The federal experts are coming next week.
It's also an opportunity
to regain the peace...
Are you crazy?
You should think it over again...
Carefully.
Schimanski!
Schimanski!
I'll have a look
at what wandered into my sights.
You twisted bastard! Sick swine!
Asshole! You idiot!
Stop it! Will you stop!
Stop!
Why did you do it?
I don't know what you're talking about.
It must've just wandered into my sights.
No idea.
Then it was an accident.
- A hunting accident. Happens all the time.
- You're sick. You're sick.
Go on, bury your dog.
Sarah, Christan, the bus is here!
Hello, angel.
Christan!
I'll not drive you to school again.
Great.
Only hours ago, a breakthrough
was reported in the serial murder case.
"Crucifix," the special unit headed
by Chief Commissioner Seiler,
arrested a suspect in Berlin.
The arrest ends the gruesome
series of murders and the manhunt
that had kept the police and the nation
in suspense for over six years.
Together with a team of experts,
we drew up a suspect profile...
Yes?
I'm watching it now.
No, he's out hunting with my dad.
Bosowski? I don't even know where he is.
Bosowski, there you are.
Always at the ready.
As usual.
I wanted to congratulate you
on your stroke of luck.
"Luck and competence go together."
Bugs Bunny.
You think you're pretty smart, Seiler.
- But I've been in this game longer.
- What?
- No rejoicing at the victory of the good?
- You did me in once, but I'll kick your ass.
Yes, I've heard that you swing both ways...
You are flying high, Icarus.
Let's talk.
- On my terms.
- Asshole!
- You need me.
- We have you.
The forensic unit just left your place,
and we can already
prove you committed nine murders.
I know you did more.
You and I have lots of work to do,
so stop jerking off.
Get used to me instead.
I'm the toughest gorilla in the cage,
and there are no terms.
School's starting soon.
The kids will be buying their notebooks
and colored pencils
for the new school year.
First-graders choose their rucksacks.
They have no idea that life
will only have shit to offer.
- Don't assume that everyone is like you.
- In the store, there's a display.
That's where the fancy things are,
the ones the rich kids buy
to make the others jealous.
There are La Strosse notebooks,
bound in leather.
Bound in red leather. That's what I want.
That and crayons.
So that I don't hurt myself.
Those are my terms.
- Crayons?
- Yes.
- A little red notebook?
- By La Strosse.
A red notebook.
- That's it?
- That's it.
- No lawyer?
- What for?
That's what I always say.
Once I have my red notebook,
I'll tell you whatever you want to know.
Then I am completely at your disposal.
We're playing. Good.
When did you murder the first time?
It was him, Martin Saales.
June 6th, 1996.
He was a floating ray of light.
Meiser?
I need something from the stationary shop.
A red notebook,
made by La Strosse. And crayons.
What's going on here?
- Karl? What is this?
- It was just on the news.
What?
They have him.
They caught the swine.
Who?
You know who we mean.
Now we'll have peace and quiet again.
Let's wait and see.
You've tested our patience for long enough.
I won't hear any more of it. That's it.
Or else what?
Will you shoot one of my horses?
Now let me through, or I'll arrest you
for obstructing state authority.
They don't understand.
They think it should be over.
- I don't understand either.
- We still don't know if it was him.
The Feds thinks so. Everyone thinks so.
It's not over until he's proven guilty.
Just believing in our innocence
isn't enough.
Faith is enough, even for God.
God can see into our hearts.
Who else can do that?
The boy was beautiful.
A little angel of darkness.
He and his nasty friend
inflated frogs until they burst.
Ever seen how that works?
You shove a straw in its mouth,
so it can't shut it.
Then they inflate more and more.
Works with cigarettes, too.
Makes a nice smoke cloud when it explodes.
- I'll bet you know all about it.
- I'm from the country. We all did it.
We didn't have any gays to bash.
Even more fun is tying two cats
together by the tail...
Martin Saales!
I knocked him out with chloroform
and dragged him into my VW van.
I'd dreamt about it for so long.
I couldn't hold back.
I fucked him while he slept.
Then I drove to my place.
I chained him to the table, and he woke up.
He spoke so calmly, asked me to let him go.
Brave little boy.
Naked and trembling all over.
But he didn't cry.
I took pictures.
You know, crucifix pictures.
He lay there,
not really as innocent as I would've liked.
But still, much purer than I.
Next time I'd take a purer soul,
a more innocent, a more worthy victim.
I cut his legs open with a scalpel.
He screamed.
I was hard. I stuck my pulsating...
Hey, are you jerking off?
- You sick pig!
- Hey!
Pig!
Is that a grave?
Yes.
Schimanski?
Yes.
Hunting accident.
I'm sorry.
He was a good dog. He'll go to Heaven.
Should I help?
No, go...
Better go inside and do your homework.
Dear God, we thank you for this gift,
for always having enough to eat,
not like the poor children in Africa,
for having it as good as we do.
And pretty please,
let Schimanski into Heaven with you.
Make sure that he can hunt rabbits there,
but that they're faster than he is,
for nobody should die in Heaven.
- Amen.
- Amen.
People are pretty excited about the arrest.
I know.
Does this mean it's over?
It's not over for the Flieders.
- What, for their sake, you're...
- Please, not at dinner.
Your son has problems at school.
- What happened?
- I don't know yet.
- Mrs. Wagner wants us to stop by.
- The teacher said
Christan's a little devil.
What happened, Christan?
Let's hear it from you.
Did you get into another fight?
Miriam said he showed her his penis.
Is that true?
- No.
- Don't lie to me.
I didn't show it to Miriam.
Thomas dared me, so I showed Laura.
But not Miriam.
- Laura told Miriam, who told everybody.
- He also wanted to see her vagina.
- Not true, you tattle-tale!
- You be quiet!
If you behaved,
your sister wouldn't be a tattle-tale.
Why did you do that?
Why did you behave so indecently?
I don't know.
You don't know why
you showed Laura your member?
What's so funny?
Do you think it's intelligent to do something
that gets you in trouble
without knowing why?
No.
Do you think it was worth it?
No.
Then maybe you should
learn to think before you act.
And decide whether what you're
about to do is decent or indecent.
Yes.
So? What is it?
Indecent.
And what should we do with you?
Can you tell me that?
After dinner, you'll get your notebook
and write, "It's indecent to show my penis"
500 times.
I'm going home.
Bye.
It's been like this for hours.
He won't say anything.
That's all for today.
You are going to talk.
You're going to talk.
Michael, maybe we should talk to Dr. Kares.
- Let's not read too much into it.
- He just can't
- cope with it.
- It was one and a half years ago.
You can't excuse everything with that.
The boy...
The two of them were friends.
My God, Michael, we're not even over it.
What do you expect of a 13-year-old boy?
I doubt that exposing his dick
is a sign of his sadness for Lucia!
He's a boy, he's 13...
He needs moral discipline.
Moral discipline?
He has that already.
I won't let a psychiatrist ruin my boy.
It might help if you just hugged him,
like you used to do.
Maybe it'd help you both.
MISSING PERSONS REPORT
FLIEDER, LUCIA
LOCAL INQUIRIES HAVE SO FAR
TURNED UP NO RESULTS
Hey, what's going on?
What happened?
I just wanted to scorch it a little.
That tattle-tale's always telling on me!
I'll be watching you.
I won't let you out of my sight!
I won't let you go astray!
Not my son! Not my son!
Thus spoke the sinners.
Let us lie in wait for the righteous,
for he is inconvenient to us
and opposes our actions,
and reproaches us for sins against the law.
He professes to know God,
and calls himself a child of the Lord.
The very sight of him is a burden to us,
because his life is unlike that of others,
and his ways are completely strange.
Let us see if his words are true,
and let us test
what will happen at the end of his life.
- It can't be true.
- ...run away...
Take the kids home.
I'll be there for dinner.
What is it, Esther?
I don't know. Tamara's gone.
- Wasn't she in her play group?
- No, I thought she was sick.
She never did that before.
- Where are the kids?
- Outside. They'll be back for dinner.
- What's wrong?
- Tamara Gabhart is missing.
We're going to wait one more hour
and then look for her.
You think...
She wasn't in her play group
and she's not at home.
She's probably out playing.
Sarah!
Christan!
Sarah! Christan!
Christan!
Tamara!
Tamara!
Tamara!
Tamara!
Out!
Out!
I just phoned with Seiler.
I'm going there tomorrow.
To the city?
What for? You think they need you?
I need myself there.
What about the harvest?
It can wait.
If I have to stay longer...
The others will help you.
- We'll share the harvest.
- But we need it all.
We have plenty.
We've never had plenty,
with the part-time job you have.
- Without my father's...
- This is a nightmare.
And it'll never stop. Never!
This town needs to regain its peace.
And you can regain it?
No.
But he can.
- Talk to your dad!
- What the hell? You fag, I'll kick your ass!
He hasn't talked in weeks.
At first he wouldn't even stop
to catch a breath.
The psycho-quacks think
he's manic and suicide-prone.
I think he just wants to jerk off,
while speaking.
- When can I see him?
- At 5:00.
But I don't think it'll be any use whatsoever.
At least I have to try.
Why?
The guy admitted to 14 murders,
almost all of them children.
He was in your area
at the time of Lucia Fiedler's murder,
- and it was his style.
- Flieder!
Lucia Flieder!
- He only killed boys.
- No.
He only confessed to killing boys.
You've never questioned a criminal,
or a murderer.
Let alone the biggest jerk-off
in our united fatherland.
I like you, farmer,
and I think you did a perfect job
on your case out there.
But this plan of yours is a waste of time.
Go sightseeing!
Go to a brothel!
We know it was him.
I'll eat my wallet
if he so much as speaks a word to you.
Do you have a plan?
- I have a stomachache.
- That's normal.
These guys can be pretty scary.
Michael. Do you know
the holy trinity of serial killers?
Playing with fire, tormenting animals
and bedwetting.
Those are their common youth experiences.
If he tries to make you nervous,
just envision him as a bed wetter. Okay?
- It helps, you'll see. All right?
- All right.
Okay.
Your turn.
The psychiatrist is done for the day.
- Anything?
- Not a word, in the last two hours.
No idea why he insists on my visit.
A waste of taxes.
Who did you expect, Hannibal Lector?
- Gabriel Engel, and who are you?
- Knock it off.
- Michael Martens.
- Oh, an alliteration!
I'm happy to see
you've rediscovered your voice, buddy.
- You and your hand not getting along?
- Tell him to leave us alone.
I'll tell you what you want to know,
but only you.
Send those fuckers away.
Would you please leave us alone?
Does he know we're listening?
Yes.
Let's hope he doesn't blab.
Hey, that's my coffee!
May I?
So what do you want to tell me?
What do you want to know?
Did you kill Lucia Flieder?
That's what you want to know?
Yes.
Is that all?
Yes.
If you want me to help you,
you better not lie.
- I'm not. I'm asking if you killed her.
- That's not what you want to know.
- I don't understand.
- You're wasting my time.
I thought you were different.
What do you think I want to know?
Why am I here?
Do you think you're a good person?
I'm not worried about that.
Admit it, you do.
Let's not start our relationship with a lie.
You're good, I'm evil. Those are the roles.
Did you kill Lucia Flieder?
But what about when you fuck your wife?
What goes through your mind?
What do you think?
Did you kill her?
Do you think, "I'll fuck you till you burst"?
You see her writhing
and you think, "You nasty slut!"
Is that what you think?
Or is it worse?
- Are you still really good then?
- Did you ram that knife into her crotch
and slit her open?
- No, I didn't.
- You're lying.
You didn't come all this way from Herzbach
to ask me stupid police questions.
It's the easiest thing in the world
to close a case. Easy.
What's in us that lies, steals and murders?
Who slit Lucia open
and masturbated into her panties?
Who fell upon the innocent girl,
tore, humiliated, destroyed her?
Who does a thing like that?
It wasn't me.
Her underwear was never found.
Only the murderer
can know there's sperm on it.
I killed 13 boys and a cop.
I did it, and I confessed.
Compared to some,
I'm just an average serial killer.
- You know I'm from Herzbach.
- How do you think I know?
You reek of the countryside.
You stink like law and order.
Of course I know
where Lucia Fiedler comes from.
I've been interrogated often enough.
What else do you want?
Her name was Lucia Flieder.
Your question isn't answered, is it?
Yes, it is.
It was you.
You won't admit it.
- You don't want us to have peace.
- Come on, you never thought it was me.
Maybe not, but now I do.
I can answer your questions, Michael.
I know who did it.
Nonsense.
What did you think when you came in?
- I'm going to go now.
- You expected a monster, right?
You were disappointed.
But I am a monster, we all are.
We're the monstrosities of God's creation,
his biggest mistake.
Come on, what do you think when you fuck?
Don't pretend you don't fuck!
We all fuck! We're all fuckers!
You were right, I'll close the case.
The easiest thing in the world.
Don't forget, I know.
I know who slit open Lucia Flieder.
I know, and I can prove it!
Ouch! Damn it!
What did you think when you came in?
What's in us that lies, whores,
steals and murders?
...slit her open
and masturbated into her panties.
What kind of person...
You expected a monster, right?
I am a monster, we all are.
We're the monstrosities of God's creation,
his biggest mistake.
What do you think when you fuck?
Don't pretend you don't fuck!
I can answer your question, Michael.
I know who did it.
Can I lead you into temptation?
Excuse me?
You've been sitting here for 40 minutes.
So either you like me,
or you like my suits.
Neither one. I was just sitting here.
- That wasn't nice of me, was it?
- No.
A very big faux pas.
- May I correct myself?
- Just this once.
I do like
- your suits.
- Nice.
I haven't had a customer all day.
- But I can't always afford what I like.
- You won't be able to resist.
Fits like a second skin. You can't tell
where the suit ends and the man begins.
It is very nice.
But I...
- I'm not big on clothes.
- But you should be.
They cover over 90% of your body.
Whatever you think you may
or may not be, you'll always be right.
You are what you think you are.
I hardly recognize myself.
A successful,
self-confident and stylish person,
that's who you could be.
I am having a drink with colleagues shortly.
Cheaper than a weekend in Paris,
and lasts longer.
- I've never been to Paris.
- You have a lot to catch up on.
Yes.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Hey, farmer! Finally!
Nice outfit.
Where is everybody?
I thought we were all going out for a drink.
Who else? Just you and me.
We're going to have a good time.
Alex! What will you have?
Listen, your performance was sensational!
Since that success,
Bosowski's been spinning in circles.
But be careful, he'll try to take the credit.
- It's dog-eat-dog! But the glory is ours.
- But I'm leaving tomorrow.
- No, you can't leave!
- Don't you think he's lying?
He lies whenever he opens his mouth,
but he opens his mouth.
But he might accidentally
- tell the truth.
- There's no point.
- And you were right, I'm inexperienced.
- Hey, farmer, farmer!
Please, keep it in perspective.
You were good. Professional! Listen,
he's into you.
Nobody knows how these perverts think.
But he wants to talk to you. Okay? Trust me.
- He can't control himself.
- Do you think he murdered Lucia?
As sure as this is a brothel!
Yes?
Hi, boss.
- It's late.
- It's been a turbulent day.
Have you been drinking?
- Yes.
- Did he say anything about Lucia?
- He said it wasn't him.
- So you're coming home.
- They need me here for a while.
- Who needs you?
The Federal Police, Seiler...
You should've seen it.
After weeks of not talking, he talked to me!
I'm not interested.
You promised me something.
I know.
Why do they need you?
The can make do without you.
The harvest is going bad.
One of our cows is colicky.
They want me to continue.
They said I was "professional".
They're using you like everyone else.
Really, he only talked to me.
He knows who killed Lucia.
Great!
A lunatic who only talks to you.
You can really be proud of yourself.
I'll be home soon.
Sure.
Hello, Michael.
- I don't want any company.
- Don't worry, I'm not here for company.
Hey, farmer, you're a real womanizer!
It's all quality checked by the police.
- Please sit over there.
- Oh, what's wrong?
Don't you like me?
These are nice tits, aren't they?
They're nice, but I'm married.
- My friend is a little uptight.
- That's okay,
I have an idea.
Michael.
Michael.
Michelle, come here. Sit down beside me.
Come, sit down, come, sit down.
It's not your fault.
You really should get yourself laid.
It's good for the soul.
- I'm going back to the hotel.
- I'll pick you up tomorrow.
You're staying?
I have my hands full.
...who turned away from Rome
to found their own cult...
Here, take one.
I don't take medication.
Fine, more for me.
What do you think when you fuck your wife?
- I won't tell you.
- Why?
- No need to be embarrassed.
- I know what you're up to.
You need a fool, someone you can impress.
Someone to get you privileges.
It's not going to happen.
We won't develop any bizarre friendship.
No relationship at all.
- There are no privileges.
- What do you think when you fuck her?
Who killed Lucia Flieder?
What do you think when you fuck her?
How did you know the murderer
masturbated on her underwear?
What do you think when you fuck her?
- Were you there? Was there an accomplice?
- What do you think when you fuck her?
- What do the squares mean?
- What do you think when you fuck her?
That I love her.
I think that I love her!
- While fucking?
- Yes.
You don't think, "You nasty slut"?
No.
You don't think about other women?
No.
- Have you ever cheated on her?
- No.
One more "no" and I don't talk
to you any more. Okay?
- Yes.
- No more "yes" either. And no lies.
What's the point?
It's fun. A game.
Another rule: no more questions,
and stop being so polite.
- I won't sit here, following your rules.
- No,
what you meant to say was,
"Screw you and your rules."
Am I right?
I have Lucia's panties.
What?
I'd like to know how you...
Tell me how you got Lucia's underwear.
I was in your area for about a week.
I watched the murder happen.
- Then tell me who the murderer is.
- Ever cheated on your wife?
- I haven't.
- She ever cheat on you?
She hasn't.
- How can you be so sure?
- I just know.
Do you play with yourself?
- It happens.
- Often?
I don't know.
- Do you love your wife?
- Of course.
Are they listening to us?
Come on. It's a simple question.
Are they listening to us?
Holy shit.
If you lie...
They record every conversation.
Shit.
- Let's talk about Lucia.
- How old is your son?
How...
- Tell me how you know about my son.
- So you have one.
Do you believe in God?
- I do.
- Old Testament or New?
I don't know, both.
I'll be in jail for the rest of my life.
Three meals a day, books, TV, medical care.
- I don't know what you mean.
- What do you think about that?
- You deserve it.
- By doing what?
By your crimes.
I kill 14 people, and that's it? Is that justice?
What about an eye for an eye?
This isn't justice.
- Does he look like you?
- Who...
- I don't know whom you're talking about.
- I'm talking about your son.
- He looks like me.
- How old is he?
Thirteen.
- Just how I like them.
- I ask you to leave my son out of this!
You're being too polite again.
- Leave my son out of this.
- Do I scare you?
- You do not.
- Why not?
- You're behind bars.
- So why not talk about your son?
Tell me about the murder.
Do you have a photo?
Come on. Do you have a photo?
- In my wallet.
- Show me.
Certainly not.
What does he look like?
He lives. Let's talk about the dead.
Is he pure and innocent,
with parted hair and a Sunday suit?
- Why are you doing this?
- I'm sure we would get along.
- Me... And your son.
- No. No, never.
You said "no." You lose!
You can't do this.
You promised to answer my questions!
Where are the panties? Who killed Lucia?
You wanted to talk to me.
I know you want to tell me.
Where's Lucia's...
How pathetic.
That's the worst attempt
at an interrogation I've ever experienced.
It'll be my pleasure to document
this incident in your file for posterity.
How could you put a village cop
on this case,
our biggest case in 10 years?
We got results.
I'll say!
Thanks to your protégé,
Engel now knows his cell's bugged.
How idiotic!
Let's not overdo it. With all due respect,
your idea with the recording
didn't lead to much, did it?
At least Engel admitted
he has Lucia's underwear.
I would...
With your permission, I'd like
- to have a look around Engel's apartment.
- Tell me,
are you kidding me?
- Why? I...
- Mr. Martens.
For strategic reasons,
my office is terminating, as of now,
your involvement in this case.
Stay away from Engel's apartment.
Stay away from my agents.
You should just leave the city.
- We're ignoring his instructions?
- Bosowski will be fuming.
Go ahead.
Have a look around.
I've been here often enough.
- These pictures...
- Sick shit.
He painted with his victims' blood.
Would you believe it?
- Where are the originals?
- They were taken in as evidence.
Here's where they found the last victim.
He killed the boy while
the police were at the door already.
That's from one of our guys?
A cop. Poor bastard.
- Why? He survived.
- If you can call it that.
He's still in a coma.
What are you doing?
All the obvious leads
have surely been checked. So...
- I'm looking a bit deeper.
- Don't bother.
- They used ultrasound and UV-devices.
- Better safe
- than sorry.
- Right you are.
In your interrogation,
the jerk-off asked you
what you think about his punishment.
You know, an eye for an eye, and all that.
What do you want to know?
You think he wishes he were dead?
If I could, I'd kill him.
And you?
These squares... There are 14 of them.
And?
14 squares, 14 victims.
Just like in his cell.
He admitted to all 14 murders.
In his cell, he had newspaper clippings
pasted onto each square.
Until the guard removed them.
Among those 14,
- is the dead policeman included?
- Yes.
Then there should only be 13 here.
In jail, he knew about the dead cop.
But here...
Something's not right.
Something's not right.
- He pasted reminders into the squares?
- Yeah, newspaper clippings.
What are you up to?
- And the apartment next door?
- The whole floor's empty.
What are you doing?
A pair of underwear.
A boy's.
And full of sperm.
Of course.
Hey, Michael! Michael...
This is girls' stuff.
Lucia.
Full of sperm, just like the others.
Farmer, you just...
Listen, we'll take
all the boxes and get out of here.
Farmer!
You solved the case.
The farmer.
The farmer solved the case.
You're good.
You're professional.
A professional.
What do you think when you fuck her?
Are you scared of me?
No!
No, I'm not!
