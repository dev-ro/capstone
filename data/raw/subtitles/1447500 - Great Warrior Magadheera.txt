Tell me the truth,

Open up the love
you've hidden inside.
Atleast in these last dying moments...
please make me your life partner...
My being... my breath...
my destination...
you're everything to me, my Mithra!
I love you!
I love you more than myself.
These dark clouds are proud
of taking your life,
it doesn't know that you're the Sun,
today you may've gone down,
but some day you'll come back piercing
the darkness to claim your love,
you'll come back.
You'll come back, Bhairava!

Bike jumping competition will
begin in 10 minutes.
Many participants are to compete.
One who jumps the highest
will be the winner.
Wow! So many girls here today!
I must ask someone a bike
and flatter atleast 2 girls.
Oh God!
They are faster than bikes.
Don't stretch it so long,
tell me what's the bet?
Rs.500 for Rs.100?!
You can pay for my dowry
and get me married, buddy.
Tell me the height.
Why are you saying it like
it's just 20 inches?
We are dropping out, it anything
goes wrong we'll end up losers.
What Harsha?
I knew it.
I'll not do it for your 1:5,
can you make it 1:10?
Pay up, boy!
Buddy!
If we lose this Rs.10000,
we may've to live cleaning bikes.
Take it.
That was shattering!
What's the feat boy?
It was pulse pounding!
Drink this, it'll cool you.
Where's my golden goose?
Buddy! Our money!
You book the ticket,
I'll pluck feathers from the goose.
Golden goose is here!
Hey girl!
Golden goose is here!
Hey girl!
See the secrets of her orange sari...
Don't go overboard, my dear...
It's in there, tell me...
When you see it,
they are swelling up!
I'll see your shameless beauty
in between the gaps...
If you need I'll come again,
don't steal my beauty completely...
Aimed at you, my golden goose!
Tell me, what's up in you, my dear?
My beauty is hiding
intoxicated with your touch...
You're caught, my goose...
Take out what's hidden inside...
I'm in hot pants...
Take yourself whatever you want...
Boss! That boy is shaking me up
with his dance.
How arrogant he must be
to enter your domain!
Greetings Master!
What boy? It seems you're
trying to weld her.
No master, just a little tinkering.
Tinkering?
What's this tuft for?
Style, master.
Turn your face little right!
Little right!
I'll cut it!
Your tuft!
Look brother!
Now you can!
I like you!
Dance doesn't mean shaking your body.
The roof must come down with the
whistles of fans for our dance.
Am I right?
Already the roof has come down, master.
You're very talented boy!
- That's in my blood, master.
You move away, boss.
Can you dance better than my boss?
Can you? Can you? Do it...
Why are you pushing me, dear?
Please boss.
- You want me to?
Okay then!
What are you looking at boy?
Shocked?!
- Yes.
You were shattering, boss.
He'll take a week to recover.
Drink boost and take rest, my son!
Come, my golden goose!
They'll not trouble you anymore.
Hey goose!
- What?
Oh my son! You shook her!
Well done!
Boss, your share.
Hey goose! Never cross my path.
That one?
Hyderabad
Bloody miser!
To save few bugs, you hired
an auto instead of a taxi.
Can we reach airport or not?
- Don't worry, dude.
For this traffic and our budget,
auto is better than taxi.
If we don't reach airport in time,
your hospital budget will bulge.
Where are you going so urgently?
To Bangkok for bike races
and bike jumps.
But your face isn't of a biker.
Buddy, a girl is waving hands,
if we pick her, cost will ease.
I'll smash your face!
Buddy!
Buddy!
Stop the auto!
What happened?
- That girl...
You said no to her, right?
The girl in white churidhar...
without her...
Buddy! I'm also coming with you.
He's having the purse.
- You stay back here.
Come on!
- Sit here!
Did you see a girl here
in white churidhar? - No.
Where did she go away?
Did you see any girl here
in white churidhar?
Where could she go in a flash?
Are you searching someone?
Yes, just now a girl in white churidhar
was waiting for auto...
That's me...
Why do you want to see her?
Do you know her?
If you ask do I know...
I do know her a little...
Please give her address,
tell me where is she?
Please... l'll take down.
Hello! What do you want from her?
I mean... we both are very close.
- Is it?
Are you so close that you don't
know her address too?
It's a long story.
- No problem, go ahead.
A year ago, that girl and
I fell in love very deeply,
but her father is a big hurdle.
- Hurdle?
Taking away my heart with her,
he left the place without
leaving any trace.
Please give me Rani's address.
Rani isn't her name...
Did you see?
He has changed her name too.
What is she called as now?
- He's a crook to the core.
Indu!
Okay, this name is also fine.
Let's settle for this.
Please give me her address.
I'm going that side, come with me.
What? Won't you get me an auto also?
I'll get it immediately.
So many has tried to flatter me,
but nobody for my dress.
I'll show him how smart I'm.
Careful... go now.
Buddy!
- Sit down.
If you go on make me sit here,
how can you get money?
Did you see it?
Buddy!
Stop here!
- Stop here!
Is this Indu's house?
You rush too much.
I mean I couldn't stop my excitement.
- Pay the fare.
No change, sir.
- No problem, keep it.
Excuse me... why are you going away
without giving her address?
If you go straight and turn left,
fourth house on the right side.
What?
Can you please call your daughter?
She's not my daughter but my wife.
Bloody...
- Got bald at young age.
You're mistaken.
Bald at young age.
I was asking about
your daughter Indu.
Should I've to give birth
to a daughter for him?
What? Love affair?
So, you're my son-in-law.
- Oh God!
How nicely you're feeling shy!
- Thank you sir!
My daughter never told me about
having such a handsome son-in-law.
Not yet fully committed.
She may tell after committing...
She hasn't committed,
you haven't yet committed,
to get yourselves committed,
you're here to make me commit.
Go!
Are you showing a scene?
I don't have children.
- No children?
Why did she guide me here then?
The lady here is my wife, try her.
Give love letter tomorrow,
show scene next day,
next day take her to Mumbai,
and then sell her off.
I'll sit inside and
sing devotional songs.
Get out! Wants a girl!
As if I've two wives and
four daughters.
Who knows? Uncles like you
silently have concubines.
What are you saying?
- Go man!
Concubine!
May have accused me but
the thought is soothing.
Who is she?
Is she so beautiful?
How long your affair with her is on?
Are you suspecting me?
He was running a fake show.
This is real shot!
Is that kid useless like you to come
and talk about your concubines?
Okay.
- I said no sound.
Where's that family?
Swearing on God?
Which God were you swearing now?
Lord Krishna?
So, you've eight concubines?
Shut up! Are you like Lord Rama?
Go, get the boy and make him say
you don't have another wife and kids.
Only then I'll let you
into the house.
Else I'll call police and charge you
under violence against women,
and get you lynched by batons,
what would I do?
Go!
Go I say!
Got a stick?
That mean you wantonly gave
me the wrong address.
Atrocious.
Atrocious? What else can I do?
How can I without knowing about you?
What if you brandish a knife
at her to love you? - Me?
What if you rape her?
- Rape?
What if you rape and kill her?
- Kill her?
What if you dispose the body?
Oh God! You're beautiful but
have a horrible brain.
What?
- She's my life.
Trust me, I never even
touched her once.
You saw her today only,
how can you touch her?
Why don't you talk to me?
Nothing has happened as you imagine.
I want to see Indu only once.
Can you give her address?
Isn't her father a big bore?
He may bite if you go.
- Big mouth!
I'll manage and bring her to
Rock Garden restaurant.
You come there.
Leaving the girl, why have you
fallen in love with her dress?
I must study you thoroughly.
Buddy, at your age if you touch any girl,
sparks are bound to fly.
Do you've to go after every girl?
Shut up.
- Let's find her.
Don't trouble me,
already I'm mad unable to find her.
This time I'll not leave her.
I'll get he complete details.
Auto has come.
Giving a pose too?
I went little overboard when you
came to my home, right?
Indeed.
I had abused you also.
- Indeed.
When bad time is on us,
we do blabber.
Can't avoid it.
Can you please step aside with me?
I'm near you only,
tell me, what's the matter?
Will you please come to my wife?
Come this side.
How do I appear to you?
A bevy of beauties are coming, buddy.
How can you find Indu amongst them?
Are you new to me?
Please move aside.
Why didn't you bring Indu?
She said she'll come little late.
Yuck!
- Yuck?
Are you yuck and she's a queen?
Please stop... please come...
Oh God! They are eating
like gargantuan!
Their sizes aren't matching
their food habits.
Buddy, one minute.
- What?
I've a doubt.
There's no Indu, they are here for
free food using her name.
We'll go bankrupt.
Did you see her face?
How cunning she appears?
- There!
Who is it?
Bloody!
He thinks we are beggars.
Get up!
Bloody!
- Why slap me?
Who are they?
Indu's friends, that means our friends.
Respect... respect them.
You please be seated
and carry on.
We can't eat if he's here.
He looks like rotten puff.
You're modest, he's like
years decayed food. Go away.
Are you asking me to leave?
Me?
They are using him to free load.
Any fool would understand it.
But he can't understand.
Have you understood it?
- Understood it clearly.
Please tell my friend.
Why should I?
I may lose money on bill.
Why are you still standing here?
I'll bring her to lmax tomorrow,
let's go.
No please, by chance if Indu
comes and finds no one here,
it may not be good.
You carry on, I'll wait.
Any which way I may look,
that fort and property
belongs to you only.
He's your sister's husband only.
He has no rights.
Though the property is ours,
I'm not able to do anything.
I've been going around the
courts for 15 long years.
Till now you didn't meet me,
I'll file a case tomorrow
in Supreme court.
You'll be in that fort within a month.
Udhaigarh
He's very dangerous man.
He has taken up this case,
it means we've lost.
We are losing the hold on the fort.
Greetings my lord!
Your son is here!
How did he come to know
about the lawyer?
Sir, I accepted this case
without knowing about you.
I'll stay out of this,
please leave me.
I beg your pardon sir,
I've wife and kids sir.
Please spare me sir.
Please tell him sir, please leave me sir.
Tell him to leave me, sir.
Run away!
Run away!
If I decide anything is mine,
I must get it at any cost.
I didn't get this thought,
anyways, it's done.
Not yet, there's still one more.
One more?
What is it?
If he goes another lawyer will come.
If the plaintiff himself dies.
He's your maternal uncle Pratap Varma.
Bye dad.
- Where are you going early morning?
A scapegoat is waiting for me.
Indira, if you kill her too,
it'll be over.
Sister... flower please.
- You want a flower?
Take it... take it...
Is it good?
What happened son?
Indira has grown very beautiful.
I want her.
Okay, first finish him,
you can have her tonight.
Notjust for one night,
I want her day and night all my life.
I want to marry her.
- Marry?
Are you mad?
He'll not agree till I'm alive.
He'll agree if you're dead, right?
If I decide anything is mine,
I must get it at any cost, father.
Uncle!
Uncle, you must be living like a king but
my father had done injustice to you.
Done great injustice.
He didn't listen to my advice.
He usurped your property,
That sin took his life.
What? What did you say now?
Yes uncle, my father is dead.
Oh God!
I don't have anyone other
than you, uncle.
This property and fort is all yours.
I'm lucky if I'm with you.
I don't want anything else.
Had you father a little
of your goodness?
Our families wouldn't have split.
Thank God, atlast we are united now.
That's enough, uncle.
Where is Indu?
Just movie tickets only or can you
go little up with your free lover.
Let me see,
how much he can take.
Ravishing shape!
Dude! What a lovely figure!
Lt'll be shattering with her.
- Yes.
What a sexy figure!
- She's running away.
What's nuisance on road?
- Get lost man.
Why always come with old faces?
Where's Indu?
They are commenting horribly.
- Who?
Youth, it's common.
Do you know what they said just now?
They will say... we must...
Forget about them and
come to our matter.
Tell me, when will Indu be here?
Indu will never come.
- Why?
They commented on her
more shabbily.
Hey... you're finished...
Why are you going away?
How dare you pass
comments on Indu?
Who are you man?
- Where are you guys escaping?
How dare you pass comments!
I like you...
I like you very much.
He didn't care no matter
how much ever you cried.
But when said that they
had bad mouthed Indu,
he is beating them to pulp.
Have you fallen in love?
Will you tell him that you are Indu?
He is coming.
- You go away.
They will never tease Indu again.
Will you tell Indu that they are gone
and ask her to come?
I've already told her.
She said she will come to park.
She said she'll come, didn't she?
- Yes
Hello, she's coming sure, ah?
- Okay
Will you keep distance?
- Why?
Though not as beautiful as Indu,
you still are a beautiful girl.
The moment you come close
to me, Indu might come.
We don't need that, do we?
Keep distance.
Is that enough?
What do you do?
How much do you earn?
Never ask a man's earnings.
Have you saved any money?
- I have enough.
I'm going to marry Indu.
Had any love affairs before meeting Indu?
- What?
Do you have any?
Affairs means... I had... of the
other type. No love affairs.
What do you mean by that?
- It means...
Don't expect me to tell you everything
in detail. You must understand.
Okay. Your opinion about me.
- A broker.
You misunderstood what I said.
A broker means someone great
who unites two lovers.
Why hasn't Indu come yet?
Oh shit!
- What happened?
I told her to come to
Sanjeevaiah Park.
Stupid.
I don't understand anything.
Why don't you tell him you are Indu?
No one gets this chance.
- What chance?
A chance to see my darling
yearning for me.
The way he yearns for me.
The way he worries about me.
The way he lies for me.
It's so good.
It's good...
It's so good...
When you pluck your hair
for my sake... it's good...
When you go mad about me...
it's good...
When you jump wall for me...
it's good...
When you bite nails looking for me...
it's good...
I'm so mad about you...
it's good...
I've reliable information that
you go forjogging in KBR park...
On the frozen Swiss streets,
speaking in French...
I've information that
you're having a burger...
My expectation is that you'll sleep
on the bed of flowers in deep sea...
I think playing hide and seek with
me in public is your intention...
On seeing a girl,
I thought it was you...
But after knowing that it wasn't you,
I left dejected...
Have you ever given a thought
she could be near you only?
I think of her... I dream of her...
I want to spend my life with her...
A beauty so near yet so far...
When will I find her?
Your suitor Raghu Veer.
He has come to return
our wealth to us.
Indu, guest house in Hyderabad is so big,
think about our fort in Rajasthan.
My dream to see you
there will get fulfilled.
What happened?
I was never interested in wealth.
But after so many days,
I'm seeing my father so happy.
Thank you very much.
Uncle, why to wait?
We'll leave by tomorrow.
Tomorrow? Let's go after a week.
I've few jobs to complete.
- Whatjobs?
My exams must get over.
- Okay.
Ghora!
I was mad about her.
But I couldn't even touch her.
I felt someone beheading me.
I'm going crazy.
An anger to kill with my own hands.
An unknown vengeance in my heart.
Who is that coming between us?
I need an answer.
Ghora has no questions
without answers.
Love desire...
...its 4 centuries old unfulfilled desire.
About 400 years ago...
you were Commander-in-chief of Udhaigarh.
This is your past life's history.
Born again after 400 years?
I can't believe this. - Fool!
This is the history of Udhaigarh
written over centuries.
Portrait of then Princess Mithravinda.
Have you recognised her?
You were Ranadev Billa
who died going mad on her.
That desire has made you
take another birth.
That strong desire of lust is making
you to do anything for her.
Just like you, he has also taken
birth to get back what he had lost.
Until he is alive,
you can never touch her
If you want her to be yours,
you must kill him.
His face is not clear.
Where will he be now?
The woman who made you
come back into this world,
you both will meet again
because of her.
Like in your previous birth,
you both will fight for her.
How to find him?
Nature will recognise you both before
you can recognise yourselves.
When you both come face to face,
birds will fly away.
The red sun will turn black.
He will come like an erupting volcano.
He is Bhairava.
Salim bhai, 2 teas please.
- Serve 2 teas.
Look at those police horses.
How beautiful!
If we get on them & ride...
any girl will fall for us.
What if before she falls for you,
you fall down from the horse
and imagine the horse
kicking you...
Like Robin Hood, I spent
my childhood on horses, buddy.
You have mistaken buffaloes
for horses.
Oh! Aren't they the same?
So scared of horses?
Never rode a horse? - No.
I can't.
We should rather ride a bike
or drive a car these days.
Why are you still holding on
to those horses, donkey?
Donkey? That means Buffalo.
One word in Telugu has
many meanings in English.
Madam is seen often with a
young man Harsha who lives here.
Search nook and corner.
Bring everyone with the name Harsha.
Go & find him. Go.
Hello boss... you can sit here.
What's your name?
Chiranjeevi.
Which company are you from?
I asked you.
Which drama company are you from?
Very colourful churidhar,
a turban and a locket.
It doesn't suit you well.
How does he look in these clothes?
You have something in your mind.
Come on say it.
Doesn't he look like the
wallet parker waiting for tips?
She has been calling this
number many times.
Hello... - The aircel number
you are calling is busy.
Don't you still understand?
They must have forgotten
to take the phone.
Your number is on display.
I don't see any signs as mentioned
by Ghora. May be it is not him.
Never mind even if it is not him.
Anyone close to Indu should die.
How is it?
Stop... stop.
Stop.
Her name is not Rani.
What is her name now?
- Indu.
What are you doing?
Return it to me.
Return my chunni.
I'll kill you.
- Go ahead, kill me.
If you fall, your limbs will break.
- Shall I fall down?
Are you mad?
- Yes, I am mad about you.
How arrogant he was!
- Forget it.
I'll find out who he is & inform Harsha.
He will kill him.
Stop. Only those who write
exams are permitted inside.
Hello... l'm talking to you.
Think of the devil and
the devil is here.
Not now. We can talk after
I finish my exam. Wait outside.
It's alright. Write your exams.
I came to tell you that I found Indu.
What a nasty jerk!
What? Did you find Indu?
- Yes.
We are finally united.
Thanks for all your efforts.
You too will find a good boy friend.
- Stop...
Once the card has been swiped,
you can't go out.
Keep talking.
What?
Feeling bad for what had
happened last night?
Come on... such things are
common these days.
Still... you must feel bad only if
I refuse to marry you. - Marriage?
Now... I came to thank the broker
woman who wants to unite us.
No... lndu.
My chemistry doesn't match with hers.
Shall I come... to Golconda?
Oh! To Golconda?
I'll be there right away.
Again? Okay.
Indu, what are you doing?
If you fail to write your exams,
the entire year will go waste.
My entire life is about get wasted.
Come...
- I'm tensed.
Come here.
You ass!
My family won't accept.
- Crap! What are you doing?
Hi! It's you!
How can I say this to you?
I'm kissing my darling,
my sweet heart Indu.
You crap! That's not Indu.
She is too good.
How couldn't she be Indu?
Trust me.
Is Indu fat & black like a pig?
See through my eyes you'll know
Indu's beauty. - Take your hands off.
Oh no! I am Indu.
Darling, why is she disturbing us?
Tell her to go away.
Am I a disturbance?
You... Get lost.
Planning to take him away from me?
Do you want my Harsha for your dirty face?
Turn this side.
Look at me. - Don't pull.
Oh no!
Will you take away my Harsha from me?
She is very jealous.
She caught hold of my hair
for touching you.
She might have killed me
had I kissed you.
She is caught red handed.
We did it for fun.
- It's fun for you but I hate it.
Don't touch me.
O candy doll!
Never stop me from
holding your hand...
O branch of snow flowers!
Never stop me from touching you...
If you order me not to touch you
or come closer...
what would happen to me?
O damsel! I was born for you...
If I don't get you,
this life is waste...
When I touched a flower,
it scolded me saying...
That you're the tender flower
and guided me to you...
Never come after me...
This flower is full of thorns...
Touch me and
you will cry in pain...
When I touched a creeper,
it scolded me saying...
That you're the lightning
and guided me to you...
With lightning comes thunder,
with thunder comes floods...
Later its flood like you...
I'll consider the floods
as a boon...
I'll even drown myself
to unite with you...
The air touched you,
so did the land...
Is it wrong for me to touch you?
I breathed air...
I walked on land...
Tell me what's so special about you?
The light touched you,
so did the rain drop...
Why is this indifference with me?
The light showed me
the path of hope...
The rain drop quenched my thirst...
How could you be compared with them?
They will be with you
until you're alive...
I'll be with you even when you die...
This place is wonderful.
You're astonished for this,
Udhaigarh fort will be mind boggling.
Let me go.
How dare you touch my daughter?
- Father...
I'll kill you if I see you
again with my daughter.
Indu is mine. Mine.
Understood?
If you try to separate us,
I will kill you. I will kill you.
Harsha, leave him.
- I will kill you.
Indu is mine. Take him away.
- I will kill you.
Let's go...
No...
Forgive me for not telling
you about my love.
There was only pain in his
words & not vengeance.
But I know that he sincerely
loves me. I want Harsha.
It's your wish to make
the decision now.
Forgive me.
I was scared that you might
separate me from Indu.
Nothing personal.
Since childhood, she has never
asked me anything till now.
But now, she asked me a favour.
She said she wants Harsha.
If I don't fulfill her only wish,
I would be at fault.
I will surely perform
your marriage.
I never thought that you will agree
for our marriage so soon.
Is he Indu's fiance?
- Yes.
Don't mistake me for what had
happened on the other day.
Nice. A perfect match.
This one thing is enough to
prove how good a lover he is.
A good father-in-law and
a good son-in-law.
A beautiful daughter.
What am I then for?
Say something uncle.
Madam... come fast.
He is trying to kill your father.
Sir...
Hey boys! Take him away.
- Father.
How dare you kill him?
Since he didn't agree for
our marriage, will you kill him?
Listen to me, Indu.
- Crap!
Don't believe him. Listen to me.
- I will kill you.
Let's take him to the hospital.
- Come...
How dare you kill my uncle?
Hey Pilot, start rolling.
Careful...
Indu, listen to me.
Pilot, start the engines.
Indu is mine.
When I wish for something,
I must get it.
Nature will feel the heat of
your enmity before you could.
When you both come face to face,
birds will fly away.
The red sun will turn black.
He will come like
an erupting volcano.
Hey boys! Let's go and
get our boss. Get up.
Indu, please listen to me.
Indu, listen to what I say. Listen to me.
Bring the helicopter down.
- Pilot, go down.
Indu, you are mistaking me.
Listen to me once. Listen to me.
Your father agreed...
- Leave me.
Long live Udhaigarh Emperor
His Royal Highness Vikram Singh.
O fellow men, the judge to
this competition is
none other than the
future queen of Udhaigarh,
our King's one & only daughter,
Princess Mithravinda Devi.
[-=DDR=-] ~ [-=Naresh=-]
The first contender is
future son-in-law of the king,
[-=DDR=-] ~ [-=Naresh=-]
the Commander-in-chief of
this Kingdom, Ranadev Billa.
[-=DDR=-] ~ [-=Naresh=-]
The second contender is the
warrior who crushes our enemies,
the mightiest of the mighty,
Kala Bhairava!
Kala Bhairava!
Kala Bhairava!
Here comes Bhairava...
In 10 minutes...
let's go back 400 years...
King, these bad omen are indicating
calamity to our kingdom.
Calamity?
- Yes.
It's eight planets coming
together once in 400 years.
Eight planets come very
near to Earth,
they are so bright that
they appear in daylight too.
Third day after this,
a comet will fall,
according to the horoscope
of the princess,
this will bring calamity to us
and this kingdom, King.
Isn't there any way to avoid
this calamity, Guru?
I can't even predict in which
form it may befall on us.
Yes King, I do see indications
of it already.
According the information
from our spies,
Sher Khan is waiting on the boundary
with a lakh of army to attack us.
Sher Khan?
Who is Sher Khan, my Lord?
A barbarian who wants to rule
over entire India.
Every kingdom he eyes either have to
become his vassal or get ravaged in war.
Guru, this storm is
attacking us now.
Yes lord!
Udhaigrah! What a beautiful place!
- Yes my lord!
Our flag must flutter on
that fort in a week.
No need of a week my lord,
say yes and one day is enough.
No Usman, your anticipation
is wrong.
They have remained
unconquerable till now.
Do you know who trains their soldiers?
Mighty great warrior Kalabhairava!
Kalabhairava? Is he God?
When a sword pierces into his heart,
even he'll bleed to death, Mansingh.
You're right, Lord.
But there must a man to do it.
Till now no man there has
lived beyond 30 years,
to them death is
just another play.
Any man born in that clan will not die
before killing hundred enemies.
Stop that nonsense!
Remember this Mansingh,
I, Sher Khan will rewrite that legend.
I'll kill Bhairava in this war,
I'll kill your fear that a man there
kills hundred before dying.
I swear on Allah, the great!
Mighty warrior Kalabhairava!
A warrior who can kill hundred!
You missed the target, Princess.
Why don't you be alert always?
No use of casually, go.
- Wash yourself clean.
Finding an enemy behind must be the
first character of Udhaigrah's princess.
Aren't you here to find it?
Future queen of this kingdom
mustn't depend on others.
If you lose heart,
you may miss the target.
I'm not able to do it, teach me.
Your vision must be on the target.
Hail Princess Mithravinda Devi!
Yourjob is to protect like a dog
staying behind the women.
Are you going to train Princess?
Suitor!
If you want to learn battlefare,
I, Ranadev Billa is at your service.
You don't need fools who boast
about ancestors' prowess.
HRH Vikram Singh is arriving!
Hail King Vikram Singh!
Got information that Sher Khan
is attacking us.
Till now your clan had
protected this kingdom.
I trust you, Bhairava.
King, to keep that trust,
I'm ready to sacrifice my life too.
He's not alone this time,
I'll also wage war along with him.
Just now Bhairava taught me to
use bow & arrow to hit target.
Would you like to see?
Very nice, madam.
But, what's the meaning of it?
For his love,
breaking the traditions,
a warrior who made his love
to win, my Bhairava.
Stop...
- Where is she?
What is this?
I'm telling you to stop.
This is princess' harem.
Men are not allowed.
I'm her future husband.
Your shyness is making me go mad.
Your body is more gleaming
than this fruit.
I want to squeeze out the juice.
But one can enjoy the fun
only when eaten in little bites.
How dare you attack
with a dagger!
What if the fruit is poisoned?
You would die.
As a bodyguard,
it's my duty to protect you.
You must eat only after I test it.
You can eat now.
Should I eat food tasted by you?
I'll eat it.
If I desire anything, I must get it.
Remember it, Bhairava!
By the end of tomorrow's competition,
the doors to your death will open.
Mighty warrior Kalabhairava!
Here comes Bhairava!
I'm also excited along with
my subjects to see who will win.
Let the competition begin.
[-=DDR=-] ~ [-=Naresh=-]
King, there's another thing which
people must know before it begins.
What is it?
Who will be the next king?
Silly question.
It's Mithravinda Devi,
who'll be the next queen...
Order me, King!
- Stop Bhairava!
You've crossed the limit, Ranadev.
Why did you do that?
I've a reason, King.
Future queen!
On facing danger, she closed her eyes
and covered her body,
she didn't draw a sword.
How can a queen who can't defend
herself rule this kingdom, King?
Sher Khan is waiting on
our boundary with an army,
people are living in fear,
competition must happen under
these circumstances,
not to know who the best is,
it must go on to find
a beau for Princess,
and to know who will become
heir to the throne.
Mithravinda must marry the man
who brings back her upper cloth.
If you feel I'm wrong,
hang me right now here.
If not accept my challenge.
Do you accept, King?
People are waiting for
your decision.
Do you accept?
I accept.
But on one condition.
What is it?
The loser will be banished
from the kingdom.
Wow! Winning over me,
and banishing me from here,
do you want to enjoy with him?
He'll not come back alive.
I'll let him come back alive, Princess.
As people spit on his face,
when he walks head hung in shame,
I want you to see it, Princess.
One who crosses this line first with
Princess' upper cloth is the winner.
King, people want Bhairava to win.
He'll win definitely.
I know who will win, Prime Minister.
Bhairava! I know your heart isn't
as strong as your body.
What would you do now?
Will you save the horses
or save princess' honour?
What would you do?
Badshah!
Pull up Badshah!
Badshah!
We must save princess' honour.
If not no use in saving my life.
Come on.
They are coming!
Mithravinda is mine!
Princess, your upper cloth
is with Ranadev.
Bhairava will win!
How could you be so sure
that Bhairava will win?
Banish him!
Banish him! Banish him!
O warrior! I can't hold
myself any more...
Come and unite with me,
O braveheart!
An adventurer par excellence...
Come and rule over me,
O my king...
You're brilliant in battlefields...
Show brilliance in love now...
With permission
I'm your bodyguard...
Shall I become king and usurp it?
Duty or love, it's same to me...
I've the prowess to serve or
attack you, my love...
My life and my soul is yours,
take it...
We are like moon
and lion's union...
It's like a sword playing
with tender flower...
If beauty unites with manliness,
it's like that only...
Won't every moment be heavenly?
There's passion which no royal
edict on earth can stop it...
There's a raging fire of desire in
the deep dungeons of heart...
Even hundreds of births can't
quench thirst of my love...
A star has united with me...
My heart is pounding...
Her beauty is making me sing...
Make love and show her bliss...
Oh rushing off!
You were wrong, King.
Bhairava has won.
I knew Bhairava will win, Prime Minister.
Why are you sad then, King?
Princess too loves him.
Look, how happy she is!
- You see happiness on her face,
but I see widowhood on her face.
King?!
Every man in Kalabahirava's clan had
sacrificed life for this kingdom,
nobody ever lived
beyond 30 years.
He's fated to die in the
battle with Sher Khan.
If I accept this marriage,
I may have to see my daughter
as widow all my life.
Royal priest had predicted
this calamity only.
You saved princess' honour,
I don't have any worry till a
warrior like you is with me.
That's my duty.
I can sacrifice my life for you.
You're ready to sacrifice life
for the kingdom,
can't you sacrifice your love?
King!
Not as your king,
I'm pleading with you
as Mithravinda's father.
To save Mithravinda's honour,
and Udhaigarh's prestige,
I entered the competition,
not with any intention of
occupying the throne.
I'm just an ordinary soldier.
Hail Bhairava!
Arrangements for outing is ready,
come madam.
Bhairava!
He hasn't come, madam.
He's here!
Bhairava is not here, madam.
He's preparing for the war.
Bhairava is here, I know it.
Is it true, Guru?
- Yes, my lord.
Bhairavakona is situated about
80 miles from here.
It is holy place of all powerful
Lord Kalabhairava.
If we offer prayers there,
we can overcome the calamity.
What a great news!
King, prayers must be over before
this 8 planet gathering ends.
So, I'll go there immediately
and make arrangements.
May you live long.
Yes my king...
This is your responsibility.
- As you say, my lord.
Princess, get ready...
for the journey.
May you live long!
If you offer prayers with
these 7 colours,
you'll get his blessings, dear.
Yes, Guru.
Beat the drums to please the God.
As you say.
Bhairava.
I don't need these prayers.
Proclaim your love for me.
I need an answer, Bhairava.
I must know where I stand
in your heart.
Tell me.
Tell me the truth.
It's getting late.
Start the prayers.
Are you sacrificing our love
at the altar of duty?
You might be known as
a man of word.
But don't forget that every letter
will be written with my blood.
Oh God!
What happened, Jairam?
Ranadev has turned traitor.
He joined hands with Sher Khan
and opened the fort gates.
As long as Bhairava is alive,
you won't get Mithra, traitor.
Mithravinda is mine.
He killed the king.
He is coming here for
the princess with his army.
Aim.
Attack.
Bhairava, save the princess.
Hold fire.
Mithra, now this kingdom is mine.
And your place is here.
Come.
Mighty warrior clan!
A clan where a man dies
only after killing 100 men.
Mansingh.
I'll prove now that what you
said is merely a puppet story.
Hey Bhairava...
I've given my word to
present the princess to him.
Bring her, make her sit on his lap,
fall at my feet.
I'll spare your life.
I'm also giving you a promise, Sher Khan.
Handover the traitor to me.
I'll spare you & your army.
Wow!
Are you going to spare my life?
I'm God.
If you are true man and have the guts,
I'll send 100 men.
Stop them from touching her.
I'll handover you the kingdom
and the princess.
Send as many men as possible
who will not turn their backs.
The very sight of them
will leave you almost dead.
Never mind if the count is more.
Make sure it's not one less.
- Even if one man survives, you lose.
Don't send one by one, Sher Khan.
Send everyone at the same time.
Mere talking will not do.
Show it in action.
Army of Satan.
I won't spare him, princess.
I'll cut his head,
and you must watch me offering prayers
to Lord Kalabhairava with his blood.
The game starts now.
One!
Ten!
Twenty three!
Attack him from behind.
Twenty nine, thirty!
Hey, you swine.
Attack him from right not from back.
Your highness, thirty two.
Forty three!
Wow!
Fifty five!
O warrior! Stay alive and
keep on fighting...
Eighty five!
O warrior! Let silence be heard...
Don't give up fighting...
Ninety three!
Ninety five!
Ninety five!
Ninety nine!
Enough, Sher Khan?
Want to send another 100 men?
Wonderful!
Bhairava.
I've come across kings who give away
their kingdoms on hearing my name,
And armies which ran away
on seeing my eyes turning red.
Though your heart is bleeding,
you killed your enemies.
I'm seeing such a braveman
for the first time.
I, an emperor who had
terrorised entire India,
is now a slave to your bravery.
I'm lucky to join hands
with a soldier like you.
Join hands, my dear.
How dare you kick Sher Khan's friend?
You have given your word, Sher Khan.
You promised to handover
the kingdom & the princess.
[-=DDR=-] ~ [-=Naresh=-]
Will you keep your promise?
Tell me.
Will you?
Forgive me, Bhairava.
Mithra.
Who is the real man?
He or me?
If I don't get something,
no body will.
Atleast, accompany me
in my death, Bhairava.
But some day you'll come back piercing
the darkness to claim your love,
you'll come back.
That's it!
Come out...
Come out...
It's too heavy.
What could it be?
Has my good time begun?
Come, Yesu & Thomas.
What's it, Solomon?
Run fast & find out how much
is Srikakulam will cost?
Srikakulam?
Why?
Planning to buy it.
I've caught a treasure in my net.
Treasure?
Pull the net with strength.
Solomon, you have caught
a very big treasure.
Is Srikakulam enough?
Or will you even buy Vizag?
I'll break your teeth.
Stop laughing & help me out.
Clear the bench.
- Okay.
How long will you take
to remove it?
Oh no!
He is too young.
Why did you do this to him, God?
Boy...
Boy...
Can you hear me?
Can you see me?
Boy...
Sher Khan.
I'm Solomon not Sher Khan.
He fainted again.
Get the cart ready.
Uncle move.
Solomon has caught
a very big fish today.
Stop teasing me.
What happened, Solomon?
Move away.
Let's help him.
Doctor, make it fast.
Give shots of injections or pills,
but he must be alright soon.
Okay.
Buddy, your sweetheart
is signaling you. - Move.
Dear, I can't buy your shyness
even if I sell Srikakulam.
I fell in love on seeing
your smile.
Give me a kiss.
Solomon, the boy is not
going to survive.
What happened?
His pulse is very weak.
- Get lost.
Solomon, what is this?
Arrack.
This is both poison & medicine.
Well done!
This is called Solomon's treatment.
Boys, Hamsa is here.
You Hamsa...
- You little boy.
Stop crumpling my upper cloth.
What would happen then?
- My mom will get angry.
What?
Will my mom keep quiet if
my upper cloth is crumpled?
Will my grandma keep quiet
if my vermillion is erased?
If that happens, aunty will go mad...
What can I say?
What can I say?
Don't say it... don't ever say it...
Don't tell any reason...
don't shake your hips...
Don't try to slip out of
my hands, O deer...
If you do, you'll pay for it dearly...
We are fated to unite...
We make best couple...
Hey you boy!
Wherever a flower blooms, I'm there...
Always after you...
Cut it fast...
Do it always...
Today is bad day,
leave me alone...
I'll follow you like a top...
I'll siege you like a prison...
I'll chase out shame from you...
Show you bliss...
Even if it rains fire...
I'll not stop for a moment too...
I'll jump over fire...
I'll hoist my love flag in your heart...
I can fly over stars...
Shall I show you the wonder?
Once I have it,
I can't hold on anymore...
Hey boy!
When chill breeze blows,
come under tree shade...
Into the dilapidated house at noon,
on the banks of lake, river,
into the street, and lonely place,
into the groves, farms,
into the grass hut near onion farm,
O boy... O boy!
Will you come with me?
I'll come like arrow...
I'll write like chalk...
Carry you like palanquin...
Come like a festival...
I'll come to your like an arrow...
I'll write your name like a chalk...
I'll carry your youth like a palanquin...
I'll be with you like a festival...
In the rain of thunders...
though life is at stake...
Will my journey stop?
Greetings Mr. Raghu Veer.
Greetings Priest.
- Greetings.
Indu, if you light a lamp here,
the dead will rest in peace.
Light a camphor in
the name of your father.
Pratap Varma.
Harsha.
You've a noble heart, Indu.
Though you're angry on him,
you still want his
soul to rest in peace.
Priest.
Why?
What happened?
Harsha isn't dead.
What are you talking, Indu?
He fell down from the helicopter...
No. He is still alive.
Indu.
- He is somewhere here.
Make sure I don't see him.
I can't even stand his shadow.
This isn't enough.
You don't have courage to kill me.
Come on try.
Come.
Come on.
Convert all your energy in
to vengeance, Ranadev Billa.
So, you also know it.
- Yes.
Now, Indu has to know about it.
The moment she recollects her past,
you'll meet a gruesome death.
Even death would fear
on hearing your cries.
Kalabhairava himself must feel the heat
and end this centuries old rivalry.
You've very little time left.
Try your best.
Hail Lord Shiva!
What are you still thinking about, boy?
If your sweetheart lives there,
just take her away.
Solomon, today is your wedding.
What are you doing here?
I must've separated lovers
in my previous birth.
So, I couldn't find
a partner in this birth.
If I unite you with your sweetheart,
all my sins would
vanish into thin air.
What do you say?
What's happening, boss?
I'm confused.
The one whom we thought
is dead has come alive.
Strange things happening
in the sky.
That's called 8 planets
coming together.
Ghora.
This is the right time to
make Indu yours completely.
Tell me, Ghora.
What should I do now?
Before this event ends and
if Indu does not recollect her past,
she can never remember it
in this birth.
Make sure he doesn't meet Indu.
Then, you will win, Raghu Veer.
- I'll surely win.
I've to tell you many things, Indu.
Do you want to narrate
how you killed my father? - Indu.
I don't have time to
explain in detail.
As you think,
your fiance is not a good man.
You're in great danger
if you stay here.
Please come with me.
How many more lies?
You killed my father.
I saw that with my own eyes.
Isn't that true?
I feel disgusted on myself
for falling in love with you.
Get out.
Get out from here.
Don't talk too much.
Let's go.
Leave me.
You're Bhairava, aren't you?
Yes.
How did you know my name?
- I know everything.
Only you must get her.
That's the right thing.
Come, I will show you the way.
Come.
Come.
Go this way.
Hey boy!
That's it.
Are you fine, boy?
- I'm fine.
Is she fine too?
Boy, I don't find another way.
I'll jump first.
He will throw the spear at me.
Before he takes another spear,
you escape with her.
Not a word more.
I can sacrifice anything
but not friendship.
Oh dear!
Wow!
The colour of their clothes are same.
We can escape by switching them.
Come.
Jump my boy.
Take her & leave.
I'll manage these guys.
What?
Where are you taking me to?
Bike is not a bomb.
Run over it.
Go.
Go back...
What do you want?
Why did you bring me here?
I hate you. Leave me.
- I can't, Indu.
I lost you once for not
expressing my love.
I won't allow the mistake
to happen again I did earlier.
Earlier birth?
- Yes Indu.
We fell in love with
each other in an earlier birth.
Try to recollect, Indu.
You questioned me infront
of everyone.
You ordered me to
accept my love for you.
You begged me here in your
last dying moments.
Before I could tell you
my love, you died.
Do you remember?
Did I fall from here & die?
If you don't stop
spinning love tales,
I will jump & die for real.
Before I die,
accept that you love me.
Won't you leave me even
if I threaten to kill myself?
Accompany me in
my death, Bhairava.
Indu, get away from him.
Won't you leave me even
if I threaten to kill myself?
Forgive me, Bhairava.
Boss...
Pilot, bring it down.
Go.
- Slice him off.
I've come, my boy!
Leave me.
If I don't get something,
no body will.
Kill him, my boy.
You both look very cute.
Careful.
How to get over there?
Solomon is here to help us.
Hey Solomon, take us there.
Fall at my feet.
Then I will think over it.
Hey boy! Why are you sitting on edge?
Don't shout. Mind your work.
- Get lost.
I don't care about you.
I'm leaving.
Are you listening?
I'm leaving.
Hey Solomon...
- What?
It's very hot.
Can I get an umbrella?
I'll hit you, boy.
Once upon a time...
Why didn't one fish brought
by the princes dry?
Why only one didn't dry?
It rained before fish could dry...
Point!
It flooded after the rain...
A mighty warrior loved by women...
A warrior to steal hearts...
A warrior the world salutes...
There's a shining lemon in
the grove near by...
You must make it stand
on your moustache...
You must promise moon...
Do impossible things...
Let all the evil eyes cast on you...
May get warded off...

With one shot everything must go...
