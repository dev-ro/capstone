"Man is created from anxiety."
Euripides
Cemal.
Cemal, I'm heading off to Hasan's.
I got things to do.
You open up the shop.
The tap near the door is leaking.
Get a gasket from Coskun's store...
...on your way and
tighten that up, will you?
God forbid,
it will go off one night...
...and we'll find the shop flooded
in the morning.
If you can't do it, call Huseyin.
Get him to do it, okay?
Huseyin owes us 20 liras; he came
in three times and didn't pay once.
Two shaves and a haircut.
If he asks you for money,...
...tell him to settle with me.
OK, son? Did you hear what I said?
Cemal?
The gasket...
I'm off.
Don't forget your keys, okay?
CiCEK BARBER SHOP
YAKUP CiCEK AND SON
Cemal... Cemal...
Cemal?
Do you have change for 50 liras?
- Come again?
- Do you have change for 50 liras?
- Probably, let me see.
What?
Bro...
- Will two twenties and one ten do?
What the...?!
So, Cemal...
Do you hear me?
You take your pills and get
your head together, okay?
We'll get over this together.
We'll get over it by talking.
Trust me, we'll get over
this together.
How come you don't know?
You know Cakir's coffeehouse near
the old bus terminal in Soma?
This Sissy Sevket has bought
that place and settled in.
He's supposed to be a former referee
or football player or something.
He lives in Salihli but has connections
here in Akhisar and in Sindirgi.
He and his people have the control
of the amateur football games.
They say there's a shitload
of money in it.
Now they got a hold of the boys,
the football players.
They get them to fix the games.
You score two goals, the other concedes.
And this Sissy Sevket gets the money.
They even printed
fake coupons and stuff.
But this Sissy Sevket is trouble.
They say he takes down
whoever he comes across.
He knows nobody here; comes
from around İzmit or whatever.
You know, they say the guys
from there are ruthless.
One time a player said he won't do it
and they broke one of his legs.
Cemal, I haven't found a way in.
I can't get into the game.
They don't just let anyone in.
They say you need a connection.
If you know someone inside,
maybe we can arrange something, eh?
Why don't you shoot?
Look, they're flying away!
Look!
See how it flew away?
If you weren't going to hunt,
why did you come with me then?
I don't feel like it.
I feel bad for the animals.
They're just trying to survive.
It's just prey. You think it wouldn't
shoot at you if it had a gun?
Look,look!
THOU GILD'ST THE EVEN
Cemal.
You haven't fired this at all.
You haven't fired at all.
Why do you go hunting then?
Even still, why don't you clean
the gun up once you're back?
You shouldn't leave it like this.
Cemal...
Who am I talking to?
You've knocked it all down!
Cemal!
- What is it dad, what?
You keep going hunting
without using a single shell.
What are you looking for like crazy?
What is it?
Mom had a necklace,
a locket with a photo in it.
I'm looking for that,
but can't find it.
Not there either?
You're now obsessed with
the locket? How nice!
Two days we've been
looking for it.
- Is Nazim not here?
- No. He'll be back soon. What is it?
What is it, Cemal?
What's up with you?
There was a necklace,
a locket with a picture in it.
Yes! Your mom's locket, right?
Its snap was broken...
...and you brought it to me.
It's been a while.
That's the one! Did I get it back?
Of course you did, a long time ago.
- It's lost now.
- I sent it to you with your father.
So how are you?
How are your arms?
My arms?
My arms are fine.
So have you started
with the games?
Yes?
Yes, dad?
No, the game is over.
Games don't last this late.
I visited mom and the kids.
I thought I'd clean the graves.
It is such a mess, dad.
No, I won't be back today.
I have an appointment
with Mr. Dundar today.
I'm killing time around
the vineyard house.
How was it not today?
How come?
It must be today.
Cemal, what's up?
What's that in your ear, spy gear?
- You hear through this, speak into here.
You don't take the phone to your ear,
you don't have to hold it like this.
And when the phone rings,
it answers automatically.
What's wrong with holding the phone?
Mr. Dundar's car isn't around.
When will he be here?
- He won't come today.
- He won't?
Today is Sunday.
He doesn't come on Sundays.
Come back tomorrow
at about 4 o'clock.
Okay?
Don't come any earlier.
- Dad?
- Yeah?
- What are you're doing here?
- Come here.
Come, look.
Look.
It's your report card
from primary school.
Fifth grade.
Excellent, excellent, excellent...
Look what your teacher Vildan
wrote here...
"I'm sure that Cemal,...
...who graduated from primary school
as the first of his class,...
...will sustain his success
all the way to university.
May his path be clear. Vildan"
See? She was such a nice woman.
Cemal, she's still alive, you know?
- Is she?
- She is.
They say they saw her at the market.
- Where did you find this?
- You kept insisting about that locket.
I was looking for it.
Because you said so.
Look here, look.
You see this? Solid as stone!
Those were the days.
Put it on, come on.
Cemal...
Will you pick one?
I feel dizzy.
This one's fine.
It's hot; why don't you take that
jacket off? You'll get hot.
Cemal...
Do the graves look bad?
- Why do you never visit the grave?
Don't you miss mom at all?
The kids... Don't you miss them?
I can't take it, Cemal.
I can't.
One day you'll be down under, too.
How will you take it then?
I'll...
...go to the mosque in the morning.
I'd better turn in.
You turn that TV off.
Behind the insurmountable power of
lions lies their capacity for idleness.
Each lion rests for about
twenty hours a day.
But during the mating season,
for three or four days,...
...they move every 25 minutes through
day and night without eating.
Lions start mating
at the age of two,...
...but they reach full maturity
at the age of five.
Before and during copulation,
the male roars continuously.
I am naked.
So is my father.
We had an old house.
It burned down.
We're just standing
in front of that house.
Inside is my mom and
my brothers and sisters.
They keep staring.
We keep standing and...
...all of a sudden
the house goes up in flames.
When the flames spread around the entire
house, I want to go and rescue them.
Dad holds me by the arm and pulls me
towards him so that I don't go.
Then he begins to kiss me.
When dad begins to kiss me,
I kiss him, too.
We're both naked, you see?
- Then?
- Then...
I woke up.
I'll release these three months
later. They're the fifth lot.
About three hundred grouses.
I came here on exile.
It wasn't a regular assignment.
There was this medical secretary,
a bastard;...
...drove me away
over a drug stamp worth five liras.
The locals are into hunting.
And there's a new hunting law now.
Made a deal with Suleyman
from the association.
He took care of the permits
and everything. Fifty-fifty.
A bird costs me 12 or 13 liras,
until its release.
A hunter gives me thirty eight.
Twenty six liras isn't bad.
I don't know much about hunting.
Are you into hunting?
Sometimes, a wheel spins
in my head.
But it's me, spinning that wheel.
How can I put it?
I imagine a wheel and
then I start spinning it.
But later, I can't stop it.
I open my eyes, for the wheel to stop.
The wheel doesn't stop, it spins.
Then I close my eyes again.
It keeps spinning.
Nazim, you've got all
the strange sayings, boy.
What was that one? You were
saying something about love.
- "No love, no game."
- Right; "No love, no game."
Are the girls like that nowadays?
Do they look for love?
You get the girl's number somewhere,
you check her out a little.
If she turns out to be an easy one,
you text her saying...
...I love you, do you love me etc.
She immediately relaxes,...
...spreads her legs and you do
the screwing. Fuck love!
What an animal!
Come on, you play your game.
He goes around horny as a dog
all the time and wonders why.
Who's horny, me? Let's go to İzmir
in the weekend and I'll show you.
Chicks are all over me.
- Bro, where in İzmir is this?
Nursing home?
Stop talking shit and
pissing me off.
Cemal, what the fuck are
these guys saying?
Come over here.
What are you looking at?
Hey, I'm talking to you, come
over here. Come here, bro. Come.
What were you looking at?
Cemal, you need to help me.
Tip me off.
I'm following up with this amateur
league. I need to be prepared...
...to seize the opportunity, if they
let me in. They are playing dirty.
I told you about Sissy Sevket's
wager gig. You gotta tip me off.
Don't you have some referee
friends or something?
- You shot the bird that time.
- What bird?
- The time we went hunting.
- Right, the grouse hunt.
- You shot it there.
- Yeah, I shot it.
That bird existed.
Now it doesn't.
- Yeah, I sold it to Nejat.
It's no longer here.
Nor is my mother.
Nor my brothers and sisters.
They all existed before.
Now they don't.
No, they don't.
We're here. You exist.
These exist, too.
We're lingering in here,
you know...
What if we never existed
what would have happened then?
- What do you mean?
- If you had never existed,...
...never had come to this world,
All these things then...
You wouldn't have known any of this.
Yes?
- What would've happened then?
- What do you mean?
What would've happened to what?
What if we had never existed?
What...?
What would happen?
Cemal, are you in love or what?
Where do you come up with these?
SHAKESPEARE
THOU GILD'ST THE EVEN
Hi.
Are you into poetry?
No, I'm not coming today.
Well l've told you.
I already told you that
I wasn't coming.
Mr. Dundar is available at 13:30.
In the morning,
I went to see the doctor.
How the hell could I know why you
didn't hear it! I don't know; why?
I told you I'd see the doctor
in the morning...
Yes sir.
The animals are ready.
I notified the distribution service.
No.
Right, okay.
No, Mr. Dundar isn't here.
That's for later, then.
Right, I'll tell him.
Have a nice day.
Welcome Cemal, how are you?
I'm fine, Cigdem.
It's the usual; keep cutting hair.
And you?
- I'm fine. Work and stuff.
You look good.
The weather is hot like hell.
So, how is the business?
People keep eating sheep, eh?
- They sure do.
- How is Mr. Dundar? He's fine too?
- Fine. He's alright, all fine.
How are the games going?
- Fine. It's going well.
We have a flag and keep waving it.
- Isn't it hard?
- Waving it?
- Yeah.
No, when needed, I take it out and
I draw the flag just like that!
I have no mercy
in such situations.
Cigdem!
Cigdem, look here.
Cemal, you came today?
Wasn't it Monday?
- Today is Monday, Mr. Dundar.
- You don't say!
Well, I'm too busy today.
- So I'll come back later.
Yes, you come back later.
Alright then. Come in here.
Why don't you come when I call?
- But we had a visitor.
- Was there?
- Stop now. Easy.
Please, not here...
Stop moving. Stop!
God! Oh my!
- I didn't see you. Sorry.
- No, it's fine.
- I'm sorry, I didn't see you.
- No, it's really no problem.
Sorry.
I didn't see you.
At least let me pay for it.
- No, really, no problem.
What is it?
What do you want?
Shall we drink soda in
the youth park together?
We can eat sandwiches too if
you like. You won't be late.
I'm Cemal.
- And my name is Yasemin.
- I know, I learnt it.
You were wiping a man's ass,
who was that?
- My uncle.
- Your uncle?
Yeah, my aunt's husband.
She used to look after me. She died.
And there was one boy,
about 18 or 19 years old?
You mean Cengiz, my Aunt's son.
You three live together?
My mother died when I was a child.
My father was in prison; he died too.
- My mom and siblings burned to death.
- Yes, I know; I heard of it.
- Really? How do you know?
- Well, it's a small town.
And I grew up here.
- I wonder why I didn't see you before.
- I left after primary school.
- Where did you go?
I went to Istanbul. It's only
last year that I came back.
- Who is there?
- I'll go back.
They gave me these pills.
I tried to kill myself last week.
I cut my wrists.
We have a barber's shop.
I work as a barber there.
I used the razor to cut my wrists.
They rescued me.
And the doctor gave me these pills.
I'll take them, but...
Would you like some, too?
Okay.
Is it good?
I don't know.
I'm not feeling anything yet.
- They're too big, hard to swallow.
- You can swallow.
I've never taken these pills before.
How do you take them, at what time,...
...how many? Do you chew them?
I have no idea.
- Hard to swallow when you take too many.
- Such big pills.
Are you feeling something as well?
- I feel like laughing.
- Really? Same here.
It's like I'm getting tickled
from the inside.
Forgive me, God...
I can't help but laugh
as I look at you.
I look at you and laugh...
God, forgive me.
- That's the primary school went to.
- It's mine too.
- How old are you?
- 27. You?-22.
- Have you ever flown before?
- Yes, once.
I went to Istanbul on a plane.
- How did you get back?
- By train.
- I think trains are nicer.
I think the train takes too long.
I like planes.
How about me?
- What?
- Do you like me?
I’ll like you if you want.
I think I want it.
- Does your stomach feel funny, too?
- Yes, but out of excitement.
- Could it be the pills?
- The pills?
Are you afraid?
- A little.
- Don't, we're puking the pills out.
- I noticed that much.
So, will you marry me?
- What?
- I say, will you marry me.
Let's get married; look at us,
we are a mess already.
If we get married,
maybe something will happen.
Wonderful, wonderful...
Look how handsome I look.
May you have a long lasting marriage.
Thank God for this blessed day.
So it's time for kids now, eh Cemal?
- It will be, Mr. Dundar.
But it has barely been two weeks yet.
- Don't say so. Sooner the better.
Don't wait too long.
Cigdem!
You've got to strike while the
iron is hot. No use in waiting.
Kids are good.
Kids are very good indeed.
Cigdem!
- Yes, Mr. Dundar.
- Here, take these. Cemal brought for me.
Get them framed and hang on the bar.
After all, I'm like a father to
both of them. Right, Cemal?
They are nice.
Okay.
Father.
Thanks, dear.
Cemal...
Cemal...
Apple?
- Eat, son. Apples are good, eat.
Elif, my friend from the factory,
is getting married tomorrow night.
The wedding is at the
Gar Wedding Hall. Shall we go?
Of course, do go.
One should attend such things.
Yasemin, listen. Look at
the bride, you see her?
- What's with her?
- Didn't you see her veil?
They spent a lot of money.
They didn't rent, they bought it.
- Bought it?
- Yeah.
Come on, let's hit the dance
floor and kick up our heels.
- Cemal, shall l go? Dance?
- Don't mind him. Look at the bride.
Why are you so early, Cemal?
What the hell were you doing
at the photographer's store?
I had left this for repair.
It's your mother's.
Your father had given it to me.
He said, Cemal was looking
for this for some time.
He found it somewhere. I had it
cleaned up at the jewelry store.
The meal will be ready
in half an hour.
How come you beat a woman?
Are you a beast or what?
Are you taking your pills?
Guess not!
What kind of men are you?
You're all assholes!
What kind of town is this?
What sort of men are you people?
In this fucking town
you've all turned into assholes.
This fucking place.
Assholes, that's what you are!
You're all dicks
in this fucking town!
What are you looking at?
It's spinning, right?
It keeps spinning;
it won't stop.
Fucking thing...!
There!
- It was a goal!
- What offside?!
Go to your place...
To your place; now!
They are getting out of control,
Sagdic. This is ridiculous!
In the Sindirgi game,
they tried to beat Ertugrul.
- Ertugrul wouldn't let them.
- I swear, the striker was...
...about to shove the flag up his ass.
We barely got him off his hands.
That's the the treatment they
deserve, these players. Fuckers!
The guy has already waved the flag.
What can he do; revoke his decision?
Right, Cemal?
You've drawn the flag already.
It's not like you'll put it down for
fear of those faggots, are you?
What happened to you there?
Turn around. Come here, here.
Cemal has no fear of players.
They think, because he is young...
But that's not how it works. I swear,
the flag looks good on you, bro.
Of course it does. First of all,
he holds it like a real man.
He doesn't referee like a girl.
Did it hurt? It'll be fine now.
Just don't move for a moment!
Hold still!
Cemal, you should consider my offer.
I'm telling you, you'll be a king.
You won't get stomped on like this
and we'll be on your side.
Work with Sissy Sevket,
and you live the life.
Rather than being bullied by
a bunch of inglorious players...
You listen to me,
you become the master.
Don't get me into that stuff.
You go ahead. I have enough troubles.
How is that? Better?
Teacher?
Cemal?
What a great surprise.
Mr. Ali, this is Cemal;...
...one of my first graduates.
He was a great student.
He was even qualified for the Bornova
Anatolian High after primary school.
But for some reason, the rascal
didn't go on to study.
- That's life, Ms. Vildan.
- Right. He became a barber then.
Is that so?
- Yes.
Come on, let me offer you some tea.
I have a free hour anyway.
I am suspicious about my wife.
I couldn't tell my father.
The man has lost half his mind already.
You can't tell friends about such.
I didn't know what to do,
so I came to you.
- So, what made you suspicious?
- You know Mr. Dundar he sells livestock.
- Yes, but what have you seen?
- I didn't see her, but...
There's this girl who works for
Mr. Dundar, his secretary.
One day he was feeling her up...
- So?
My wife has the same necklace
as that secretary girl.
- So?
- She doesn't get paid enough...
...to buy such a thing.
- So?
- I beat her.
- Who?
- I beat my wife.
- Well done!
Son, how come you beat your
wife of three weeks?
And now you've come here to
tell me about it. This is horrible.
I beat her a lot too; poor woman.
She just took it silently.
Cemal...
Do you love your wife?
- You haven't changed at all.
- I haven't? It's been 20 years.
Of course I've changed. Anyways...
Tell me, do you love your wife?
I do.
I love her very much.
What I mean is...
I had no such thing in mind.
Why would a woman marry a man
she doesn't know?
One gets all sorts of ideas.
- Those are heavy accusations.
You can't go around blaming people
with no evidence like that.
I'm unwell. I'm not fine.
I'm all stiff inside.
Okay.
Now, you should first go
and soften up your heart.
Then give your wife a present.
I don't know;
take her out to a dinner.
Make it up to her, and don't go talking
such nonsense. Tell her nice things.
Say nice things?
SHAKESPEARE
THOU GILD'ST THE EVEN
- Is this a good book?
- It depends on you.
- What?
- Do you like poetry?
Is it good? Are there
nice sayings in it?
- Those are Shakespeare's sonnets.
- Yeah.
- Give me that. What will you do with it?
- Well, it's a private thing.
Yes, they usually are.
What is yours; why do you want it?
To apologize.
Kind of like a present.
Anyway, have a nice day.
- Hey, just a moment.
To whom will you apologize?
- My wife.
Okay, this is good.
This will do.
He jests at scars
that never felt a wound.
The envious moon,
sick and pale with grief,
Thou art far more fair than she...
You know, I hit you the other day.
I want to apologize, but...
...a simple apology wouldn't do.
So I will read you a poem.
- What? Read a poem?
- Yeah. Read a poem.
He jests at scars
that never felt a wound.
The envious moon,
sick and pale with grief,
Thou art far more fair than she...
I bought some tripe. We'll make
fresh "mumbar" in the morning...
What the heck are you doing here?
Will you excuse us for one
moment, dad? Please.
He jests at scars
that never felt a wound.
The envious moon,
sick and pale with grief,
Thou art far more fair than she;
First of the fairest stars
in all of heaven,
Thou!
Thou gild'st the even.
You are so beautiful, Yasemin,
that I can't take my eyes off you.
Does the poem have "Yasemin"
in it as well?
Yes.
You have nothing to be feared.
Actually, you have something
to be happy about.
You are three months pregnant.
Haven't you thought
it would come out?
I was using a pill.
I was supposed to miscarry.
And you didn't?
I thought you were a good man, Cemal.
I trusted you.
I trusted nobody in this life, but...
I don't know.
I just trusted you.
You know the day you gave me
those pills, we flew...
You and I, flew, Cemal.
So, I thought you'd understand me,...
...help me.
I know it is very hard, but...
...this is a good man,
I said to myself.
Of all the people only Cemal,
would help me, I thought.
I suffered a lot in this life.
I thought, maybe...
...this time I'd see the light of day.
I said to myself, Cemal...
...will understand you, forgive you.
Help you.
Will you, Cemal?
Hey, spy...
I see you're getting ahead.
What is it with the gun?
But your dad was a hunter,
wasn't he?
Why do you shoot the animals?
Isn't that a pity?
They have lives, too.
They're just trying to live.
- For once, fuck off...
What?
Yes, Numan?
Which pipe?
The one at the back?
Okay. Alright, I'm coming.
Hey man, you're late.
Give me a cigarette.
Everyone has their own
troubles in this life, Cemal.
And this is mine.
Fuck that, I can't die.
You think this is a good thing, don't
you? That's what they all think.
But ask me.
You know the worst thing about it?
You have no fear of anybody, anything.
You lose the sense of shame.
Right and wrong, and
everything gets all confused.
If you knew what these fuckers
believed in a hundred years ago,...
...you'd have a good laugh.
I do.
I'll know what they will believe
in a hundred years, too.
I know every single thing, Cemal.
Knowing everything is the same as
knowing nothing.
You feel all dead and empty.
That's why you shouldn't
dig too deep into things.
There is no way a mere mortal can
solve the problems of this world.
Now tell me,
what made you so upset?
- Yasemin...
- Yasemin?
I swear l have nothing
to do with her, Cemal.
Granted, Yasemin is a beautiful gal.
And I'd be lying if I told you
I never had any thoughts about her.
I did think of fucking Yasemin.
It did cross my mind.
I really wanted to,
but I didn't have the time.
I have nothing to do with it, Cemal.
I didn't do it. I swear, I didn't.
Everyone has the right to lie once in
life, but I'm not lying to you now.
But Yasemin is a good girl. Be fair
to her, she's a very good girl.
You couldn't get yourself
forgiven?
I guess the book
didn't work for you.
Take it back. Maybe it will
work for someone else.
I knew it.
What?
- That you'd come back.
- How?
Don't ask how.
You'd come back, and we'd
hang out. I knew that.
Everyone knows.
- Everyone knows?
Everyone knows what? I'm so
confused, I can't understand you.
Don't worry,
I'm saying good things.
- What's happening?
- You're falling in love.
What?
Come on, take me somewhere.
I stay here with my grandmother.
In fact I'm studying in İzmir.
Literature and stuff.
I got bored of it, ran out of money and
so on. So I came back for a while.
Whatever it means, to come back...
I've been a boarding student
since primary school.
You were lucky that you get to
know your mother.
Mine died giving birth to me.
And I faintly remember my father.
He had cancer, colon cancer.
In other words,
he came to a sticky end.
I fell in love with a boy in İzmir,
he loved me too.
Then I learned that he was married.
His wife, her brothers and so on,
things got really messed up in İzmir.
So I just came back here.
And here my grandmother is ill.
I keep rushing her to doctors and
hospitals and so on.
In short,...
..."On the road of sorrows for years,
I'm neither the first, nor the last.
Life is putting me down;
I'm a child of sorrow."
I don't like Orhan Gencebay.
- This is not an Orhan Gencebay song.
- I know, but I don't like him.
He plans every little thing.
I mean...
Right, maybe he's the best "baglama"
player in the country;...
...or, he's great at changing four modes
just in the intro of the song and so on.
But why put the guitar into it?
I think he doesn't behave as he feels.
He doesn't seem sincere to me.
But Ferdi is different.
He seems more straightforward to me.
He does as he feels, without planning.
He doesn't get into things
he doesn't know.
He may know only three things, but he's
the one who knows them the best.
Orhan would tear himself up
saying "I know too";...
...but Ferdi would just sing
"I miss you too".
What have you done, man? If you
knew so much, why didn't you...
...tell it all to your wife?
- She wouldn't listen to me.
And she already knows all of this.
Everyone knows these.
These are things we all know.
Our problem is bigger.
It's not something that a goddess...
...or whatever can heal,
as it turns out.
Well, you don't like Gencebay,
you don't like Shakespeare...
We need something else.
Something we never knew before.
Your path is a hard one.
This is the hand we are dealt.
It's always the same.
However you arrange the cards.
No matter whose story you hear,
it's the same words, same types,...
...same boring plans.
- So you say,...
...you ain't no good to me, either.
My God! He says "ain't"; so cute.
"Ain't"!
Are you pregnant?
I think so. Why?
What do you want from me?
- What is your name?
- Cemal.
Cemal...
I've never met a man who read his
wife poems to apologize. Right?
Isn't that enough by itself?
Is it?
MUNICIPALITY OF AKHiSAR
Now, it is simple. We get you assigned
to a game and tell you what to do.
You either chalk a goal off as offside,
or warn the referee for a penalty.
Or you get a player to curse
and the referee sends him off.
You might ask why the referee
does not do it himself.
Because the referee has
deals in other games.
We use one person in each game.
In this one, we'll use you, got it?
Once the game begins, Samet will come
and stand behind the wire fence,...
...make eye contact with you,
and tell you what to do.
Well, it's only human nature,...
...you may be on a bad day and
not feel like doing it, right?
So we pass it on to someone else on
the field, and the next morning...
...we gather for your funeral.
Is that understood, too?
Fine. You keep nodding like that,
but this shit is serious, you know?
You people panic once the game begins,
mess things up and big men like...
...club chairmen end up doing time,
and we still deal with this mess.
Do you get how serious this is now?
- I'm aware of how serious it is.
What do we get in return?
Good. I like a man
who cuts to the chase.
Ten for the first job, twenty for
the next; and then we'll negotiate.
Keep in mind that you'll have more
responsibilities each time.
Today we have the Sindirgi game,
at eleven. Get ready for that.
Fine, I will.
How about rather than paying
me, we make another deal?
My, my. It turns out you're
a real man of the business.
Tell me, what do you want?
I want my wife.
Find my wife.
- Dead or alive?
- I love my wife so much.
So?
Don't let her die...
Cemal...
Teacher?
- Where have you been all day?
- I don't know.
Where is your wife?
She went. She's gone.
Is she gone?
- You said you were...
...very worried about your wife?
- Where is she?
She's going.
She must be on the plane.
Plane?
Hello there.
Cemal Cicek.
I heard that you've done
extremely strange things today.
You violated the contract,
didn't go to the game.
Who told you that you could
break the deal on your own?
Nobody told me anything.
It all happened as necessary.
Fine...
Is there anything
I can do in this case?
You don't give a fuck, right?
Are you sure?
- I'll find my wife.
- First, pay your due...
You got in the game, bro?
Will you shoot me?
Why the hell did you do that?
- Look, we want you to understand us.
Fine, you don't believe us,
but at least understand us.
It was you who broke
the deal; not us.
You didn't keep your end of the deal,
but we will. A deal is a deal.
You'll get your wife tonight.
Dead, or alive...
Do you think it's all so easy?!
I didn't wave that flag!
I didn't!
And you won't shoot my wife;
do you hear me? Do you?
Do you hear me, you bitch!
Cemal?
Why didn't you help me Cemal?
I told you I was in trouble.
Look what they did to me.
You lied...
Why did you lie?
You said there was a boy.
You said he was married.
But you are pregnant
by the doctor.
This is really a small town...
Yes, I lied to you.
But everyone has the right to lie
once in life, right Cemal?
Let me tell you everything.
Yasemin! I'm here.
You're there, aren't you?
Are you running away from me?
Don't go, Yasemin.
We'll get rid of all the troubles.
I'm coming to you.
We'll fly together again.
I love you so much, Yasemin.
I'm coming to you.
Yasemin.
I know I don't deserve you at all;
but who deserves what?
To whom does all of this belong to?
All this land, trees, birds...
Who is it all for?
Whose is it all?
Where among all these do we live?
In the midst, on the edge, under, above?
Where among them do we stand?
I don't know any of this.
I'm coming to you, Yasemin.
I love you so, so much...
I'm coming to you.
You're there, aren't you?
You're waiting for me, aren't you?
THOU GILD'ST THE EVEN
