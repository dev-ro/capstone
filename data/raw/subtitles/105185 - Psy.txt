Mr. Mauer, what did you do
to Captain Nowakowski
who wanted to establish
Solidarity in the service?
I shot him in the head With a 7.8 mm Mauser.
Can you explain that?
He killed his wife, had his daughter on the roof
threatening to kill her.
What did he want?
Registration of Solidarity and a pay rise.
And?
I climbed a chimney
and shot him in the head. Got it?
You got a medal for that...
I hit him in the temple
with one shot from 250 yards.
Since then, they've invited me hunting.
Did you know Captain Nowakowski?
We studied together. Witek...
Captain Nowakowski was my...
he was my friend

Jerzyk, up you go!
There were that many informers?
This is only two years and two districts.
Take this.
Well, Lieutenant, how's it going to be now?
Nothing. The same...
Or even better?
Careful. Granddad.
Go easy.
Burn it all.
I remember.
I almost got him.
It turned up in the end
in a shop in Hamburg.
The church bought it back.
Through that...
Zielinski.
Right. Hold this.
- What happened to him?
- Stroke.
Last winter.
Into hell!
What you're doing is breaking the law.
We've informed Knita's Senate committee.
He's checking this Firm out.
The what?
Don't play games with us.
Stop burning those files.
You'll be up before Senator Wencel soon.
Him from the Christian Union.
What about the Otwock case?
Hang on, Olo.
Mr. Wontecki.
I'm obeying orders. Ask my superiors.
Do I throw this away?
Please wait in my office,
Irenka will show you the way.
I know it by heart I'd find it blindfold.
Blindfold, there and back.
You're a great lay. And I know you want me.
I'll call the police.
I am police.
- The priest from Otwock.
- Close it. No evidence
Just like that?
No. Question his daughter.
But we're going to burn the file.
Question her first.
We've got to do things properly.
If she says something...
Heard this one? A water skier is drowning
and the lifeguard gives mouth-to-mouth...
I've heard it. They're taking my flat away.
It turned out to be the caretaker's flat.
I have to move out or clean the block.
Big block?
Question her for me.
I have to talk about the flat.
Talk to that bastard you wanted to kill once.
Call her in tomorrow.
Better to go to her. The case is closed anyway.
Where is she?
In a home. He couldn't
keep her at the church
Angela.
- Why?
- Why not?
Angelica Wenc.
Get up!
The lieutenant wants to talk to you.
Hi, Franz.
Good morning, Lieutenant.
You are looking good.
We have to discuss Bazylak
sometime. He's on remand.
We won't disturb you. Bye.
Who's that?
Arms dealer.
I'm full. You can fuck me now.
Hi.
- Grabek asked about you.
- I'll find him.
Don't you want me?
You won't take me back there?
I don't know what I'll do.
- Why'd you get me out?
- To stop him fucking you.
You're 22 days too late.
You got a house? Family?
My father's supposed to be a priest.
My wife's in America. She left me.
Silly bitch.
She took my son.
My brother's in New Zealand.
So why are you here?
Are you talking about my brother or my wife?
Your son.
I'm tidying up loose ends.
I like your car.
It's my wife's.
It's not a cop's car.
What else did she leave you?
Nothing. She took the lot.
Why did she leave?
Simple. She's a bad woman.
And you're perfect?
I'm a saint.
Shame.
Want any more?
The sons of bitches sent
the Building Committee to
pull my house down to see
if the materials are stolen.
They want invoices.
Who holds onto bills that long?
- You said you had them.
- Fuck off.
Cheers.
They only fired 20% of the Lodz staff.
70% in Krakow.
We should have killed
them when we had the chance.
Right. A few lads,
a few spades, a lot of sacks.
I can't eat this!
Third-class dog meat,
minced with the kennel
and a bitch.
They can't get rid of everyone.
They have to have some sort of security service.
The Jesuits?
They'll choose a few of their own.
We'll be the beat.
Wouldn't be so bad...
It's fine for you. You're young.
What about me? On the street.
What can I do? I'm only an interrogator.
Go on TV. A quiz show.
Drink up and go home. Before tonight.
- How much?
- Three truckloads.
Officer Morawiec from the Police Academy.
Got your papers?
I'm glad you're here and so on
but I've got plenty of good men and no work.
What's wrong? Start a business.
A gun shop.
Or a sex-shop.
- His dad's a prick.
- Do something about him.
Let's go.
Franz, you've drunk the
least. Come with me.
The rest of you, to bed.
- Get up, Police!
- Security Police.
Tonight, we're burning the past.
You know each other?
Captain Stopczyk questioned me eleven times
in fifteen years.
What are you lighting up?
Me? Polish cigarettes.
But Franz has Camels.
Don't fuck me around.
What are you burning at the dump?
Trash. The health service
is taking the building.
Burning bills.
For clothing, stationery.
No one buys wastepaper now.
Major that was a secret.
Don't fuck me around!
No more bullshit!
These gentlemen reckon that you're burning files.
What files?
Major, are we supposed to believe this farce?
Jeromil
Waldek, tell us what you heard downstairs.
Captain Stopczyk arranged
with his drunken officers
to burn files tonight.
What do you say to that Stopczyk?
I don't believe it.
Neither do I. What do you say?
Olo. Smell anything?
Mmm, not shit, more like... Dead meat.
How does informing usually end?
In a cemetery.
This is outrageous!
That was a death threat.
I demand the immediate dismissal of these men!
You're dead and buried.
They'll sling us out.
No worries. We'll open a gun shop.
That bald guy would give us a license.
Wolski?
He had two strokes and retired.
Well then, a sex shop.
I'll never forget his face.
Any trouble?
I couldn't open the door.
I'd like you to meet each other.
Hi, Olo.
Hi, Angela.
Nice guy, that Olo, isn't he?
Funny.
- Known him long?
- Long enough.
Not too vain.
He's as old as you maybe even older?
I didn't mean it like that.
Understand?
Jesus. You're beautiful.
Franz, let's go to bed.
It's stupid, sleeping apart.
Don't be like this.
You won't be disappointed.
Come on, just once.
No.
Why not?
Somehow I don't trust you.
Somehow I don't love you.
God, it's only sex. Don't be such a saint.
Leave it.
I disgust you.
Because I've slept with so many men?
No, I'd disgust myself. Got it?
Sometime... in 10 years
- will you love me?
- You'll find out.
How?
Go to sleep.
Nice camera.
From the Firm?
A friend lent me it.
You've got friends?
Yes.
- Careful. It's expensive.
- Expensive?
Jesus - you bastard!
Are you crazy?
You're all fucking mad.
You should be locked up.
You threw it away!
You little prick. You think this is a game?
Office politics?
This is the real world.
What do you want to do?
Kill 50,000 informers?
You want blood, you Little shit?
When you grow up, you'll
understand. This is no game.
This is real politics, here.
We leave it here, or stay forever.
Understand?
Are you mad?
Do you fucking understand?
You missed at that range?
Understand?
What are you looking at?
There's no-one here.
I guess I'll be off.
Lonely here, alone.
Did you see Lt. Zwirski
fire at the new officer?
At the dump?
I don't know anything about it.
Ask Olo. He knows who he killed last.
It's not funny.
You're on trial, not me.
Times change, but you're
always on the Commission.
Are you prepared to enforce the law?
In the new Poland?
To the bitter end.
Poland's or mine?
Did I ever put you away?
Take a backhander and let you down?
You're looking at me like I'm one of yours.
They threw you out?
They threw me out.
They kept the others on and slug me out.
But I could still have you put away.
Can I help you?
Whisky and coke.
Got a gold watch?
Then I will have you locked away.
You can't. I outranked you.
Hang on...
From Lublin Major Gros.
Cunt! Fucking Cunt!
We haven't got whisky.
Will vodka do?
I've got a job for you.
What sort of job?
Why don't you ask how much?
Tell me the job and I'll tell you how much.
After a year on the dole you'll be different.
I'm a mechanic. I'll find something.
None of ours ever got a job.
As muscle?
I've done worse.
Where's Franz Mauer?
He's serving the new Poland.
They kept him on?
Fuck the priests.
Fuck them all.
Priests and Reds.
Fuck them all I'll drink to that.
Fuck them all.
Hi!
I did steak for supper.
It's probably cold by now.
We were drinking.
We're on the crime squad now.
Expect Olo.
- Bad news?
- Only for Olo.
You should be going to school.
They'd only all fuck me again.
A point against school.
Jealous?
Get lost.
How do you like my 17-years-old body?
Old enough.
Why did she leave you?
My wife? I told you she's a bitch.
I think I like you for your smile. Smile!
What is this? Request Spot?
- Please?
- I don't feel like it.
I'll never leave you.
Can you wait? I'm eating?
Police, is it?
And you're Stasi.
You've confused me with someone else.
You want to meet the Slaby brothers?
Marian and Zenon.
To introduce the new connections.
The last one was eliminated.
Between you and me the next one will be too.
Calm down.
This is provocation.
You're boring me.
Officer.
The Slaby brothers have
25 kilos of amphetamines for you.
You lost the goods, the money and the connection.
200,000 Marks.
Didn't you?
And your friend?
Is he as witty as you?
My name is Major Bien. My rank: Major
You are under my command as of yesterday.
I'm your direct superior.
You're in the real police now.
You used to be well paid for doing nothing.
Now it will be lots of work.
And hardly any money.
No one here gets 30 reprimands.
You would be after 2, even
if your father is general.
Waldek the map.
Maurer shut the door.
Tonight, we stake out the hotel for can thieves.
Stolen is Germany, sold in Russia for big money.
Anyone takes a bride,
I'll kick his ass so hard
he'll taste shoe polish.
The doors?
I could stand maybe a day or two.
But you?
This'll do. Won't?
Where and when?
Do you pick the drugs up?
Talk!
Talk! Where and when?
Talk! When?
When and where?
When and where?
What if he doesn't speak German?
He should fucking learn languages then!
Nice place for a summer house.
When we take over the connection
you'll be able to buy it all, to those chimneys.
You're sure he wasn't lying?
No one lies with a car
battery wired to his balls.
Tough bastard.
He won't float?
They never float.
Franz, this is Jerzyk. Over.
Franz here, over.
Nothing new. He's smoking
his tenth cigarette.
Bloody cold. Get me a relief.
Ask the new kid. It's his operation.
Over and out. I don't
ask an informer for anything.
He can kiss my ass.
Taking in the school kids was best
They were so scared.
One word, and they'd run.
The girls were different cheeky.
Boys knew they'd get hit. The girls...
I don't know...
Maybe they thought they'd get away with it.
Fucking weather.
Ever fucked in this kind of weather?
I remember weather like this once...
Lieutenant.
I got you some coffee.
Lieutenant, it'll go cold.
You scared me.
- Don't shout.
- It'll go cold.
Thanks.
Do you remember taking the Solidarity radio down?
In '82, weather like this.
You switched to Crime.
That wasn't work with
your lot. See old friends
in cuffs. I couldn't look them in the eye.
So pull their eyes out.
Keep shouting, and you'll be directing traffic.
Not bad...
Fuck!
Bastard! I'll kill him.
Said he had a Ph.D in Politics.
His dick was hanging down to his knees.
Come on!
It was...
- I've never seen bigger.
- You haven't seen much.
Franz, what a mess.
Bastards.
Fascists...
Shit! I though the war was over.
Check it out.
Maybe your men are up to something.
At last.
What's up?
He's left, or put the light out.
Check it!
Alone?
I'll get them together.
Fuck this for a job.
I grabbed her cunt in the hall...
She pulled free when she saw my cap.
- Let's get him.
- And the others?
Move. Jerzyk's up there alone.
Student?
What's up?
Get Mauer. We're going in.
He went to phone.
Get him! Where's Junior?
Getting burgers. Here he is.
Drop them. Get Franz!
I'm hungry.
Now! That's an order!
It's an order is it. Bastard.
After he's had our booze.
Student, where's Franz?
He went to phone.
You go and get him.
Open up. Police.
Don't mess around. Open up!
Don't make me wake everyone up!
Open up or I'll get the keys from reception.
- On holiday?
- We' re working, you prick.
You couldn't afford it.
Don't go away, girls.
Let me do it, son.
Police!
Open the door.
Or we'll break it down
Christ!
I couldn't get through.
All day.
Junior?
My gun's in the workshop.
Let's go.
I haven't got a gun!
I haven't got a fucking gun!
What's a code?
Fuck knows. Give me the gun.
Let go. Shut up.
This is Motel One. Junior!
The magazine?
What do we do?
How do I know? Where's the room?
Hang on... 2nd floor round the corner.
Listen!
You see anyone with a gun, shoot to kill.
I've never shot anyone.
Kill them or I'll get fucking killed.
OK.
20 years service.
The boss gave me reward.
Outstanding service.
I want to work in the office.
I can type.
I want to work in the fucking office.
I'd be good at it I know the printers.
And the connections.
And the Oppositions.
The Opposition is in charge now.
They killed Granddad.
Fuck this!
What's happening, fuck it?
I die for 200 fucking bucks?
They shot at me!
What are you staring at?
I didn't go to college to be shot at.
What the fuck is this? I've had enough.
What's going on?
They shot at us! Understand?
They're here. Out.
Halt or I'll shoot!
Christ.
It's not all bad. Jerzyk
only broke his collarbone.
He's been given blood and he'll come to soon.
You'll be able to talk to him.
Kazek lost part of his
ear - he can't hear much.
The specialists reckons
he'll be out of shock soon.
Junior is worse off...
They are doing their best.
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch.
Calm down!
Fuck it, I'll be calm when I'm dead.
You know why they're dead?
Grandad, Student - why?
The bastard had to phone.
He had to phone. He wasn't there in time.
Jesus!
Fuck! They're dead. Understand?
Shut up! Fucking shut up!
Don't say a fucking word!
Shit!
Shit!
No-one else is going to
die because of this bastard.
No one.
Fucking no one!
I'll report you.
I'll ignore it. We don't report each other.
I'll deal with all of you.
Will you stop if it hurts?
Don't be silly.
But will you stop...
Let me in.
Is that it?
All?
Darling.
Squeeze me.
Not with your arms.
- I don't know how.
- Squeeze me.
Like this?
Make love to me, Franz.
What?
I like it.
What's new?
Grandad and Student are dead.
Junior will die soon. Kazek went mad.
Jerzyk is badly hurt.
We were supposed to take
in car thieves at the Max.
They weren't car thieves.
We were like target practice.
The guy we were watching...
They cut him in pieces
pulled his eyes, tongue out
They knew we were police and they shot at us.
Olo, they're dead.
What's the Firm doing?
Bien wants to relax the firearms rules.
In any normal country they'd already be dead.
Quietly...
What do you want to do?
I'm out. Wladek reported that's my fault.
This is your chance to get back in.
Who are you watching?
A Dutch drug dealer.
Used to be an East German citizen.
A Stasi agent.
Remember Jaworski?
Went to East Germany
a lot. They fired him too.
I'll ask him.
The Slaby brothers' produce
drugs in demand in the West.
Now the Stasi are gone they've got a monopoly
Who set them up?
Jaworski. Know him?
Yes.
They said he was on the take from drug dealers.
Same as they said Franz shot the Pope.
Ask him yourself
Olo doesn't believe you took bribes.
I can't believe it myself.
12,000 bucks a year.
Now, I want more.
Mum?
This is the price of an ounce in Berlin.
Clean business; clear profit.
Will they let you in on the business?
They're having bad luck.
They lost their connection money, goods.
The Slabys' backers are losing patience.
Who?
Reliable people.
They're in Moscow now. They'll be here soon.
The Slaby brothers...
How much can they make?
As much as we want 20 or 30,000.
Dirty business.
Clean profit.
Dirty in here.
You could do with new flat.
You will go to Cracow with Prosecutor Nowrocki
and meet Prosecutor Zurawski.
Chaplinski.
I'm Nowrocki.
You'll sell Chaplinski a lottery ticket.
- For how much?
- Face value. 50 cents.
How much will he win?
$10,000.
Ask him to let Chemist go.
Before the end of the month.
Does he know what's going on?
Like that flat?
Go on then.
Nice car, isn't it?
Gross will sell it cheap.
300hp, turbo, goes like a dream.
They are in a hurry with Chemist.
Generous... twice the going
rate for letting someone go
or losing files.
I was softhearted.
Hold on to the wheel.
Don't worry.
Rush job. The controller's
coming in from Moscow.
They' re afraid the Slabys will be first.
Good money, eh?
I can't imagine even a bank having that much.
Let me onto the investigation.
And who are you? You and your mates?
Try treating me like a policeman.
They didn't treat you as
Police. They shot at you.
No one shoots policeman.
You are just a thug.
Who lost all his red support.
People like you and Olo used me for 30 years.
People spat at my uniform.
Now you can't even lick my boots.
Go to sleep, Franz.
Bien, we'll be fucking back.
Olo and me.
- What about the mortgage?
- I don't know.
I'm glad you're back. They're from America.
They went to buy your house.
Is this yours?
My wife's. I'll put the kettle on.
Got any money?
Almost $500.
How much do you earn?
$400 a month, with overtime.
A fortune.
Enough for two. Or do you want more.
No.
Shame about the car, though.
I'll miss it.
Don't cry, silly.
I never liked that house.
It'll be heaven.
Fuck it, we were so good together.
Do you want to leave me?
Do you love me?
So what's the problem?
The Slabys are here.
One shorter than the other.
When will Chemist be out?
On the 26th.
Something's up. Follow him.
The big one we can convince, Zenon's tougher.
What do you mean?
Zenon, Slaby is stubborn.
Hard to get through to.
But if we get rid of him
the big one is softer.
Who'll do it?
Whoever's taking the stuff to Amsterdam.
How much of it will there be?
25,000 units.
Want me to do it?
Stop here.
Ever killed someone from close up?
I'll do it.
Keep the car. The papers are genuine.
Take Chemist from the hotel on the 27th
He's got to be in perfect condition.
If Slabys get him it'll be a mess.
They took my car. I'm always late.
I had to take Angela to a friend.
Keeping an eye on her?
Keeping an eye on her?
No, taking care of her.
After Milena, I never thought I'd care
about a woman again.
I really love her.
That child?
I'm sorry.
Take my car. I don't need it any more.
Thanks. What happened?
Tonight, the chemist Jaszczak checks in.
He'll give the name Blusz.
Take him in. Quickly.
Hold him for a week.
Long time.
Joblonski can keep him under arrest.
Not for free...
If they find out you were
in the Firm, you're dead.
Take Chemist in. I'll do the rest.
Line them up.
We don't know enough yet.
We'll deal with them.
Both of us.
Now, the Chemist vanishes.
I'm not setting myself up.
Who was your father?
Read my file, smart-ass?
He got Marchwicki. So...
He was the best detective in the country.
You won't get me like that.
You won't get round lead us to these bastards.
Coming? Or just waiting?
Listen...
I understand.
Nice place.
You can always ask for a transfer to Archives.
You could get fired. I won't cover for you.
Archives...
- I don't want to.
- Shut up.
This is it.
Who the fuck you are?
And who the fuck, are you?
Where the hell are you going?
Police.
Blusz? You should be in jail.
I have heart trouble! Call an ambulance!
You don't have a heart.
You had your brother killed.
Let him go. He's ill!
A doctor!
An ambulance!
It's a stroke. You'll kill me!
So die.
Stop! He's having an attack.
I can wait. You can't. Who got you out?
Who got you out?
- If I tell, I'm dead.
- If you don't, you are dead.
- Who got you out?
- You can't do this!
Prosecutor Nowicki, ask him.
Good morning.
Good morning.
May I speak to Prosecutor Nowicki?
He's in hospital.
Heart attack.
Please don't smoke.
You're bothering the birds.
I'll leave him a summons.
When he's better, tell him to call in.
To the animal shelter?
Not exactly.
You're late.
Chemist was taken last night.
Shit!
Get him out.
Who took him in?
I heard it was Franz.
Give him $10,000.
He might not be able to...
He's here.
Which one?
The one with the flowers.
Don't tell them, or the Slabys
about Chemist.
I'm talking to you.
Tell Franz that he frees Chemist or dies.
Is Franz a friend?
We get along.
Rewizor talked to the Slabys today.
They don't know about Chemist but can't wait.
Here he comes.
Who's the girl?
Nobody. Some little whore.
He's fallen for her.
Fallen for her?
You mean he loves her?
Know her well?
Met her a few times at the place.
Talk to Franz and clear the Chemist thing up.
Or we'll have to kill Franz.
Meet the girl.
If she loves him she might help.
When the Reds left the priests moved in
and this mess turned into a circus
with dancing dogs.
Then I saw Student's body.
With two bullets in the head.
And Student had the guts to quit,
to be an ordinary cop.
Another one.
Ever thought about money?
Big money?
To get it...
A million, for example.
If we don't stop these bastards
we really are shit
and we belong in the sewer.
Are we good for anything?
If we're not policemen we're nothing.
Why?
Some are born priests,
some whores, some thieves.
That's good, because you can spot them.
I'm not a whore.
No, of course not.
What do you want?
Coffee.
I want to speak to the man in the gray suit.
The one with his back to us.
How's Franz?
Did he let Chemist go?
No. But I'll talk with him.
My turn to talk with him.
Hello?
Hi. Who are you purring for?
You know.
No, I don't. Tell me.
No.
Just say it. I'm a big boy now.
I won't slash my wrists.
You know...
I don't.
I won't shout. Don't worry.
I know. You never do.
Who is it?
You know...
Who?
Olo.
I don't feel like talking to you.
Something important, Tadek?
Very important. Get in.
You wanted to talk to me?
- I haven't got much time.
- We'll manage.
One on one.
I don't understand.
I work for Siwy.
We'll have to frisk you.
Rewizor can't deal with two at once.
He'll prefer Siwy.
Siwy offers a better margin, safer transport.
And the best product
Siwy hid Chemist somewhere.
I've got Chemist.
- How much?
- A million.
I can get the best experts for $10,000.
A million for his eyes, not for his work.
My brother won't agree, but I'll talk with him.
I'm afraid you'll have to decide by yourself.
- I'm ill.
- Where is Nawrocki?
He didn't show up?
Must still be in hospital.
What are you up to, Franz?
Not much, why?
Never seen a dead body? Put him in the car.
They're already talking,
he must have been important.
Once...
We're here.
Franz, we're here.
Want a drink?
What?
Just joking.
Maybe we should go back?
Why?
Franz was... strange.
Take me home.
If it bothers you, go back yourself.
Go on!
Fuck!
So, Mr. Nawrocki, still alive?
What, another check-up?
No. Not worth it.
I'll call the nurse!
You're breaking my finger!
Not here. Somewhere better.
This'll do. Do you know Blusz?
I didn't let him go. Some mistake.
I got a summons
I sent it.
You?
You 're a policeman?
I'll file a complaint. What's your name?
Show me your ID.
It's your last chance to use it.
Brezhnev is dead, and so is your system.
You're way out of line.
Who got Blusz out?
I'm saying nothing under these conditions.
Who?
This is abuse of power!
Who?
You were only ever thugs!
No!
Who?
Olo Zwirski brought the money.
I was only the driver. Ask Olo.
- I'm dying.
- Good.
On the 30th of this month once again
Franciszek Mauer has been brought before us.
His record indicates that he is not prepared
to guard law and order in democratic Poland
and that he is unfit to serve as a policeman.
And so his employment is hereby terminated.
Mr. Maurer.
Please wait.
I haven't finished.
There are still charges against you...
A present.
Thanks.
I don't have a player.
Listen when you get out.
I'm sorry you got fired.
Waldek.
Thanks for coming back then.
Pigs have to stick together.
I'll clear it up after you.
Put me on a new shelf.
You're late.
You're looking good, Franz.
A drink?
Sorry you lost your job.
But it's one cop less.
I need a gun.
I had to hand mine in.
Trying to set me up?
Don't worry. I'm just an
ordinary bandit now.
You are a stubborn bastard.
- Get in!
- I'll call the police.
I am the police.
Bullshit.
I'll break your head.
In broad daylight?
With a hundred witnesses?
You don't scare me.
I'll kill you if you don't get in.
You wanted to talk to me?
I've got urgent work to do.
I'm making a coffin for my
brother. Now talk.
They've got an edge on you.
Contacts and experience.
They know how to hunt, find, plan and kill.
Well trained, secret policemen.
They were in the best run Mafia in the world.
This is routine for them.
And they'll take your boys apart.
What do you advise?
Employ the same people.
So why did you bring me Chemist?
You don't have to kill him. Buy him.
He's too afraid of them.
I'll take care of them.
For half a million.
Alone?
Alone.
How do you aim to that?
I'll kill them all.
Evening. What's up?
Hello, Sasza. Got a gun?
What do you think this is? A hoover?
Who is it?
Two men. One with a briefcase.
For Daddy.
Daddy, there's a man with a briefcase to see you.
We'll open the case.
Dress up, we've got guests.
I don't have anything.
You should get me something
What's up?
Rewizor wants to see the factory.
No one here.
Not very welcoming.
Not Polish style.
Let's get out of here.
It's a police trap!
We didn't pay this much
to set up for the police
for my brother!
I don't have time.
My plane leaves at six.
You've got guests from Moscow.
Wielki? Don't make a fool of me.
Fuck off.
Dead... is dead.
Franz, don't be stupid!
We've been friends for 20 years.
You think I shot at you?
It was that psycho!
I got rid of that bastard.
Please! You're the one
who said we had to clear up.
You think I betrayed you?
I never betrayed you!
They wanted to kill you. I stopped them.
I did the same as you. I
couldn't wait for the court.
I wanted to bring them down.
Don't fuck around.
I swear I'm telling the truth.
Don't fuck around with my woman.
Why?
A matter of principle, you son of a bitch.
Yes.
It's me.
Who?
Angelica.
I've got nothing to say to you.
