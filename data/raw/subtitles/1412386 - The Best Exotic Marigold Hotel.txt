Mrs.
Greenslade, thank you fur waiting
I've consulted with my manager-
Now if you'll just stay on the
phone for a moment and talk to me.
Just talk to me.
Of course.
I'm not even clear- I mean, I don't actually
understand what it is I'm trying to order.
Is wireless the same as Wi-Fi?
And what do either of them
have to do with broadband?
Mrs. Greenslade, since the
account is not in your name,
before we can make
any changes,
we need to verify details
with the account holder.
Can I I please speak
to the account holder?
What?
I'm asking if l can talk
to the account holder:
Before we can make
any changes-
You can't talk to him, no.
He's dead.
He died of a heart attack.
There's only me.
Mrs. Greenslade, since the
account is not in your name-
Lord Justice Walton requests
the pleasure of our company.
- Had you forgotten?
- I hate retirement parties.
Crap cheese, crap wine.
Endless speeches.
Why do people do that?
Nobody- Nobody ever said about
a retirement party, you know,
Well, this is great.
I can't wait to have
one of my own.
it'll be yours one day.
One day very soon.
You've been saying that for years.
It was often said of Stancombe
that his bark was worse than his bite.
But as the recipient of both,
I can testify to the fact that
neither actually required surgery.
His relationship with
all his pupils...
was founded on respect.
We respected him, and he respected that.
Indeed, to this day,
I recall his response."
to the unwelcome news
that I would trans-
...praeciptium a tergo lupi.
[Echoing]
This is the day.
Graham?
This is the day.
And there's an unlimited range
of leisure opportunities...
just a stone's throw away.
So, as I say, what you're looking at
here is very competitively priced.
You won't see better
for your Grey Pound.
Another little feature-
not necessarily right now,
give it a few years-
rails on the wall
to help you get around.
And over here, a panic button.
In case of a sudden fall, brings
the warden running.
What if we fell
somewhere else?
Sorry?
It's just we might not manage
to plan our sudden fall...
in the exact corner where the button is.
Yeah, but-
And would it be possible to have the rail
going through the middle of the room-
Darling. to help us get
across, as well as around.
Um, c-c-could we have a moment, please?
Thank you. Yeah.
Thank you so much.
Darling-
Thirty years in the civil service,
and this is all we can afford.
W-W-Would it help
if I apologize again?
No.
But try it anyway.
Could Dr. Mackenzie please
make bra way to Theater 7.
Dr. Mackenzie to Theater 7.
Young lady, I want a cup of tea.
And I want it now.
The trolley
will be along shortly.
How hard do you have to fall
to get proper attention?
I've been lying here for hours.
Not a single doctor
has come to see me.
Now that's not quite true,
is it, Mrs. Donnelly?
A doctor did try and examine
you, and you sent him away.
What, that one? He can wash all he likes.
That color's not coming out.
I want an English doctor.
Oh, an English doctor.
Why didn't you say so?
I'll get one right away.
Thank you.
Mrs. Donnelly,
this is Dr. Ghujarapartidar.
Notes, please.
J Now here we go with the
flow of the girls you know J
J The ones seen in Argentina
and Mexico JJ
And after that, I worked as a
systems analyst for a few years,
but I just found it so dull.
What I really wanted was to do
something more creative that matched-
Um, I'm sorry.
Um, on the form, they asked
for our age bracket."
and the age
we wanted to meet.
And in both cases,
I ticked 25 to 39."
That's right. So did I.
Anyway, don't stop. Uh-
Something more creative.
How old are you?
Early 40s.
And, you know, my interests
are travel, theater-
Do you mean you were born
in the early '40s?
Judy, I know what you're asking.
It's Judith.
Judith. Trust me.
I've still got it.
Just can't ind anyone
that wants it.
Hi. I'm Norman.
This is crazy. You're crazy.
You can't just up and leave like this.
And yet, if you watch me, that's
exactly what you'll see happen.
What's going on?
Your mother's lost it.
- My mother never had it.
- You talk to her.
She doesn't listen to me.
Nobody listens to you.
I still don't understand
what's going on.
I just asked her to babysit,
and now she says she's leaving.
But you love babysitting.
I loved it last night.
We had pizza
and stayed up late.
- And the night before?
- We had Chinese and stayed up late.
If you don't go,
tonight we could do a curry.
It's tempting, darlings,
but you know I have to leave.
We know.
Being here is stopping her
finding a husband.
Another one?
Bye, Granny.
Bye, Granny.
Don't let the buggers
get you down.
How many husbands
have you had anyway?
- Including my own?
- Mother.
Mother.
Mother!
Thank you, yes.
Right. Name the place, darlin'.
Where you going?
I've absolutely no idea.
There's no other way.
There just isn't.
Harold told us this
three months ago.
And I'm afraid
matters have only got worse.
We can't wait any longer.
We need to put this flat on the market and
at least start paying off Dad's debts.
I've talked it through
with Polly and the boys.
Of course, we all agreed.
Ma will come and live with us.
I think that's best, Evelyn.
And it's what Hugh
would have wanted.
Good. Well, that's settled.
End of discussion.
Oh! That's just what your
father used to say- Ma.
When there'd never been
any discussion at all.
I want to look after
things for you.
What, like he did for 40 years?
Look how that turned out.
How on earth do we know
what Hugh would have wanted?
And would he have seen it
to tell us anyway?
Obviously,
the flat's got to be sold.
And you're very kind,
and dear Polly.
But I shan't be
coming to live with you.
You need a new hip,
Mrs. Donnelly.
It's not a difficult operation.
That's easy for you to say.
You're not having it.
Regardless.
You do need a new hip.
- I'm not gettin' it from you.
- Not me personally, no.
- No, none of your lot.
- I see.
When do I have the operation?
I'm afraid you'll be on the waiting
list for at least six months.
At my age,
I can't plan that far ahead.
I don't even buy green bananas.
There is another way.
Our hospital trust is funding
a pilot scheme...
that will enable us to outsource
you to another hospital."
where they can perform the
procedure almost immediately...
and at a fraction of the cost.
Is it local?
They cover the
cost of the flight out apparently.
When did you get a computer?
How far along
is the progress bar?
That thing at the top.
It tells you- I know what it is, Ma.
What are you
showing me anyway?
Come and spend
your autumn years in an Indian palace...
with the sophistication
of an English country manor.
Tucked away on the outskirts of Jaipur, and
graced with breathtaking surroundings-
"I My terraces,
open courtyards,
domes, arches".
And canopied balconies
abound with opulent comfort.
Indeed the entire building
exudes historical ambience...
and transports one back in time to
the proud tradition of the Raj
Is that good?
It is. It is.
Very good.
Thirty-six years, four months since
the day we were called to the bar,
and you've never once
talked about India.
Do you want
any of these books?
You might be needing them again.
- Mrs. Megson.
- Sir?
I want you to have this.
Are you sure?
Oh, absolutely.
Th-There's a little crack there
just on the bottom,
but I think you know something
about that already.
I used to live there...
a long time ago.
There won't be
any golf courses.
Well, that's just as well.
I can't afford the green fees.
But a retirement home?
It's a luxury development."
where all the residents
are in their golden years.
Like the Costa Brava?
Yeah, but with more elephants.
You know
who'll be there- Indians.
Loads of them.
Brown faces and black hearts.
Reeking of curry.
And you never see one
on their own, do you?
I mean, they always-
they move in packs.
Makes it easier to rob you
blind, cut your throat,
You know what?
You can wheel yourself from here.
You're supposed to
take me to my flat.
My wife's from Mumbai.
Well, don't blame me, mate.
You married her.
My wife's from Mumbai.
Has anyone thought about what happens
when you get to the other end?
They said somebody's
going to meet us in Jaipur.
How are we going to know
you're all right?
Well, I'll call.
They do have phones there, you know.
Or you can read my blog.
Your what?
On the lnterweb.
Just log in whenever you
like and read my news.
Well, I hope the first item
will be announcing your return.
I don't suppose they'll be
paying for the journey back.
Look, before I go, I wonder, could
you say one thing that's supportive?
I've never done anything like
this in the whole of my life.
You've never done
anything at all without Dad.
I don't think you'll
be able to cope. Well,
let's just ind out,
shall we?
And the connecting flight to
Jaipur is first class too?
That's right.
I tell you. it's tough
to get upgraded nowadays.
I had to flirt so hard
with the travel agent,
it was practically
phone sex.
Oh.
Well, this is my lucky day.
Sir.
We'd like to take a look in
this bag, madam, if you don't mind.
What have you
got in here anyway?
It's just PG Tips.
And some brown sauce.
Thirty-one packets
of chocolate Hobnobs.
That's pickled onions
and, yeah, pickled eggs.
And that's just pickles.
Pickles.
- No liquids on the plane.
- What's that mean?
It means you can't take
the pickled onions...
or the pickled eggs.
The pickles fine.
Oh!
Obviosly, one
has read one's Kipling,
but we view this as an opportunity
to explore another culture,
as well as making
new friends.
And a High Court judge is just the
class of guest one was hoping for.
isn't it, Douglas?
Sorry?
And, um, is this your
first time in India? Yes.
You don't look like
an experienced traveler.
Oh, I'm not.
But one has read one's guidebooks.
It should be there.
No.
Oh.
Oh. Hi.
Hello. We haven't met.
Norman Cousins.
Madge Hardcastle.
A pleasure.
Play your cards right,
and it could be.
Look. My chair, What?
Oh, yes, yes. Hang on.
May I have your attention, please?
We regret to announce cancellation
of Flight 105 to Jaipur,
owing to bad weather
at the destination.
We apologize
for any inconvenience caused
Right.
Of course iris a good idea.
Who can one trust
if not a High Court judge?
I suppose this way
we see more of the country.
If anyone asks,
say you're my mother.
I don't want people
to think we're together.
In your dreams.
Douglas, these are not words
that often pass my lips,
but you may actually
be right.
This country seems rather more
civilized than one originally thought.
Okay. Thank you.
The bus- The bus will take us
to the center of the town,
and then we can get tuk-tuks
the rest of the way,
What did he say?
So it's down there. Yeah, it's down there.
Down here. The yellow one.
That one.
But look at the bus!
There's not enough room!
First rule of India-
There's always room.
There we are.
Ah.
Sorry.
In you go. What larks, Pip!
Well, let's hope so.
Oh!
Oh!
I'm really
loving this.
Oh, Thank you.
Are you insane?
Avoid all food
not from a reputable vendor.
It'll be washed
in impure water.
It's just a sandwich.
Oh, marvelous. Then I'll have
ham, cheese and streptococcus.
Or perhaps bacteria,
lettuce and tomato.
Huh.
Would you like some of this?
I believe it's called
aloo ka paratha.
No, if I can't pronounce it,
I don't want to eat it.
How long since
you've been here?
Forty years.
Oh.
That's as long
as I was married.
My husband died recently.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you think
we'll be all right?
God, don't ask me.
I'm more scared than you are.
Oh.
No.
It's going to be
extraordinary.
What exactly is a tuk-tuk?
Oh, look! What's that? Look!
Oh!
Ah!
ls this it?
Well
Here! Watch it!
Sorry.
Welcome to The Best
Exotic Marigold Hotel!
Oh!
There's an Indian in there.
Ah.
This will do.
Bird in room.
This is a building
of the utmost character;
which means that perhaps not everything
will function in the way you expect it to.
But, as the manager."
and chief executive supervising
officer of this Marigold Hotel,
I can tell you with great pride that the
building has stood for centuries...
and will continue to stand for many
more in 100% shipshape condition.
Please follow me, carefully
avoiding that naughty stone there.
Around this corner,
leading us most successfully
all the way to-
your bedroom.
Where?
Here. In here.
My dear man,
rooms have doors.
What you're showing me here
is an alcove.
A door is coming soon,
most definitely,
How soon?
Let us not concern ourselves
with details, Mrs. Hardcastle.
Rather than speaking
of doors,
we should instead take pleasure
in the freedom to roam.
Does your room have a door?
A most effective one.
Good. Then that's
where I'll be staying.
You will be
coming to the hospital...
once you ire satisfactorily
recovered from your journey.
The operation requires a stay of five days,
and it is done under general anesthesia.
A hip replacement usually
takes only two hours.
Your surgeon will remove
the top end of the thighbone...
and insert
an artificial bone instead.
A most routine procedure.
Have you got
a marker pen on you?
Why?
I want to mark it.
I don't want you
to do the wrong hip.
I want to stay at the other hotel,
the one that's in the brochure.
Mrs. Ainslie,
prepare to be amazed.
This is that very building,
madam.
You Photoshopped it!
No. I have offered a vision
of the future.
Of course, I'd hoped that by
now it would be the present.
But, you know, in India,
we have a saying-
Everything will be
all right in the end.
So if it is not all right,
it is not yet the end.
What will start to make it all right
is if you'll give us a refund.
Of course. Of course. If that is what
you desire, then you must have it.
Absolutely no problem. I'll refund you completely.
You will?
Most definitely, madam.
Straightaway?
I most definitely will.
Straightaway
in three months, okay?
Um, have you tried, um,
jiggling it about a bit?
Yes, I did that.
Did you kind of bang it lightly
on the desk a few times?
Yes, I did that too.
Okay. Um-
Right.
How do you come
to be in India?
Oh, uh- Oh.
I invested our-
well, my retirement money."
in our daughter's
Internet company.
She assured me that as soon as the
start-up actually, uh, started up...
and the conversion from virtual to
actual became sufficiently viable,
then she'd be able to pay it all back.
I'm not sure I understand
what most of those words mean.
Well, it turns out
neither did she.
Ah. There you are.
Good as new.
Really?
No, of course not.
Now, would you like me
to, um, not ix that chair?
Because I could almost
certainly do that as well.
How long have I
waited for this moment...
to present to you,
in honor of your arrival,
a special Welcome Britishâ
roast for you all.
Cooked lovingly by myself...
and my most loyalist helper
and friend, Young Wasim.
- Roast what?
- A wonderful taste of Blighty.
Roast what?
Roast goat curry.
Gentle friends, you have found
your way to this place,
bequeathed to me
by my beloved father,
that I have raised from the
ruins of his broken dreams.,.
And renamed The Best
Exotic Marigold Hotel.,.
For the Elderly and Beautiful.
Yes. I use these words
most deliberately.
For you have all heard
the chimes at midnight,
and long in tooth
have you become.
Who knows how many days
you have left?
But we are most honored that you have
chosen to spend that time with us.
Please-
Oh!
What's he got?
Douglas, do something.
Let me through, please.
My brother is a doctor.
Sorry, please.
This man is dead.
Oh, my God!
Please, we must cover his face.
We should preserve his dignity at this terrible moment.
I'm sorry, buddy.
- He coughed. I saw him cough.
- He moved.
He's alive.
Did- Did I nod off?
All is right. He didn't die.
I was looking forward to that meal.
it's hell.
I was frightened.
I'm in hell.
Marigold
Hotel, Jaipur. Day nine.
Old habits die easier than
we think, and new ones form.
No longer do I reach out
in the .morning for Radio 4.
My news comes instead
from the Jaipur Herald.
Soon, I might even grow accustomed to
the storm of car horns and vendors.
One moment.
The carburetor, sir,
Carburetor is broken.
Can there be anywhere else
in the world...
that is such an assault
an the senses ?
Those who know the country of old
just go about their business.
Bu! nothing can prepare
the uninitiated. ..
For this riot
of noise and color;
for the heat the motion,
the perpetual teeming crowds.
Soony is conducting his own
personal assault on our senses...
with a How of exotic dishes he
demands daily from the kitchen.
Mooli moong dal,
bagara baingan,
banjara gosht,
paneer methi chaman,
mutton vindaloo.
Initially, you're overwhelmed.
But gradually
you realizeit's like a wave.
Resist
and you'll be knocked over.
Mrs. Donnelly!
Drive into it, and you'll
swim out the other side.
Excuse me, I wonder, could you
direct me to this address?
No more. No more.
I don't have any more.
I haven't got any more.
This is a new
and different world.
The challenge
is to cope with ft.
And not just cope, but thrive.
Graham was talking about
this marvelous temple.
I thought you might
want to come with me.
I'm your wife. Have we met?
Would you really rather
stay here all day?
Yes,
given the alternative.
When I walk out in the morning,
all the street kids smile at me.
That's 'cause
you give them money.
Um, okay.
I'll go on my own.
- This can't be right, surely.
- I am thinking so, saab.
There used to be houses all along there.
These were homes.
I can take you
some other place?
No. No, no, no. No.
That will be all for now.
Thank you.
Here. Thank you very much.
Thank you, sir.
Um, excuse me.
Yeah?
- Uh, there used to be houses here.
- All knocked down.
What about the people,
the families?
They moved to
a different place.
Uh, don't- don't grip it so
tightly with your right hand.
The bat.
Yes, it's just there
for guidance.
You keep
your left elbow high."
so you play through the ball.
Thank you.
Okay,
You're ready to go home,
Mrs. Donnelly.
That's not my home.
I want to go back
to England.
As soon as you can stand up and
walk onto the plane, you can.
Until then, I will assist
in your recuperation.
How is the hip feeling?
They must have got lucky.
It's strange.
The more operations they
perform, the luckier they get.
Oh.
I didn't realize.
Um, sorry.
Oh!
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm dreadfully sorry.
Yes?
Sorry.
I'm just looking
for this address.
Yes.
Do you understand?
Could you help me
find this place?
Yes.
Is that, yes, you do understand
or, yes, you could help me?
Yes. Yes.
Oh.
Well, let's just
go with both, shall we?
Yes.
Oh!
Yes.
Give me the ball.
I can take him.
Down is where
you are going, uncle.
You do your worst.
Come on, Sanjay.
You can do it.
Come on, Sanjay.
I felt the need,
the need for speed.
Yes!
Are you all right, uncle?
Yes. Yes, I'm fine.
Oh.
We do appreciate your custom,
which is very important to us.
And can I draw your attention
to our special new-
Are you sure I can't
offer you something?
We have some, uh, English breakfast
tea, Building tea, as you call it.
A builder's tea?
Builder's tea.
No, thank you. I'm fine.
So, tell me. How can I help you?
I don't think you can. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have come.
No, wait.
It's just that I saw your
advertisement in the local newspaper,
and it specifically mentioned the
ability to talk to older people.
But this wasn't
what I imagined.
- You came for a job?
- I'm sorry. I've wasted your time.
Look, everyone working here is a
graduate from a good university.
This is a place for ambitious
people, young people.
Yes, I see that now.
I'm sorry.
No. Please, sit down.
Sit down. Please.
So it is really builder's tea?
Yes. We dunk biscuits
into it.
You dunk?
Well, it means lowering the
biscuit into the tea...
and letting it
soak in there."
and trying to calculate the exact
moment before the biscuit dissolves...
when you can whip it up
into your mouth...
and enjoy the blissful union
of biscuit and tea combined.
It is more relaxing
than it sounds,
Perhaps you can
help us after all.
I thought
you weren't coming.
Have I ever let you down?
Um-
Don't answer that.
I have to go.
Leave this place.
Come to work for me.
You can't afford me.
I can't afford anything.
I miss you.
Am I coming round tonight?
Uh, let's meet somewhere else.
I will rent a hotel room.
Sonny, you own a hotel.
It has many rooms.
Some of which are now occupied
with actual real guests.
Paying guests?
Why must you nitpick?
It is not an attractive quality.
Sunaina.
Hello, Jay.
Sonny boy.
Don't call me that.
If you're gonna mess around with
my sister, don't do it in public.
Let's go.
Good evening, Your Honor.
Ah, good evening, Mrs. Ainslie.
You have a good day?
What did you get up to?
Well, I started
in my bedroom,
where I spent a happy couple of hours
giving all the cockroaches names.
And then, after a lunch that will
long have a place in my heartburn,
I came out here
and stared blindly at a book,
waiting for someone-
anyone- to rescue me.
And how glad I am
it was you.
Why would you not go out?
There's so much to see.
All life is here, Mrs. Ainslie.
I tell you.
Oh, I could have a word
with the chef if you like,
Perhaps some grilled chicken
and plain rice?
That would be
much appreciated.
All right.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Please. Please, sit down.
Oh.
Thank you.
I trust you had
a good day.
I'd rather hear about yours.
I got a job-
my first ever.
I'm going to be a sort of
cultural adviser.
A role I'm sure you'll perform
with great distinction.
Perhaps you wouldn't
mind keeping that to yourself.
Well, I-I-I'm flattered
you told me about it.
Good evening, the Ainslies.
Did you have a good day?
Spectacular actually.
I went to the temple you told me about,
a place of meditation and peace.
It was quite stunning.
So spiritual, I bet you never
noticed the smell of elephant dung.
No elephants, sadly.
I thought I might see you there.
Where did you get to instead?
Yes, where do you
get to every day?
Well, I-I've just been telling
Mrs. Greenslade all about it.
I'm sure she wouldn't
mind hearing it again.
Oh, I talked to the chef for you.
Absolutely no problem.
Did you hear that, Douglas?
Plain grilled food,
Manna from heaven.
I don't have Io have it too, do I?
I can't thank you enough.
You really should
see this temple.
Oh, I'd like to very much.
But maybe take
a clothes-peg for your nose.
Good night.
Good night.
Um, Mrs. Greenslade?
Evelyn.
Would you mind
if I showed you something?
I grew up here,
just a short drive away.
It was a big house.
We had servants.
Oh, we knew their wives
and children, and...
one of the boys, uh, Manoj-
Oh.
He, um-
He became my friend.
And, uh, we played lots
of cricket together, and-
Well, we played everything together, and-and
it stayed like that for a few years.
And then, um-
And then one night, it, uh-
it became something else.
We had a few months together.
We had that.
And, um- And then there was
a weekend in Udaipur...
where... we were sitting by a lake
and watching the sun go down.
And, uh, I remember thinking that I-I
would never be this happy again.
And- And I was right.
Because, suddenly,
it was over.
We'd fallen asleep,
and they found us.
Well, it was bad enough
for me.
But I knew who I was, and I
think my family guessed.
But for-
for Manoj, the-
the disgrace was absolute.
His father was fired.
His family was sent away, all of them.
And, uh,
well, I don't know
what I could have done.
But it should have been
more than nothing.
I just-
I just let it happen.
I didn't put up
any kind of a tight. I-
And then, um-
Then I went back to England,
to-to-to university.
And, uh, I always said, you know, I'm
going to go back. I shall go back.
And I never did.
Until now.
Until now.
And now I think-
What if I'm the last person in
the world that he wants to see?
Do you want to see him?
Yes.
Yes, yes.
Then you must.
So now that we are
fully operational, Mr. Maruthi,
it is clear that, with a small injection
of funds for the phase two development,
The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
can rise like a phoenix...
to its previous stale of glory.
And, look,
when I say small injection,
I mean small in the sense
of, uh, medium-sized.
- Possibly larger.
- Well, this hotel was never glorious.
Just the phoenix part then.
How many rooms will there be?
Many. Mmm.
How many?
A great amount.
Plenty of rooms.
No question.
I'm not a details man, Mr.
Maruthi. Nor was your father.
Mr. Maruthi, I present to you
one of our beloved guests.
Dear Mrs. Donnelly,
please can you describe to us in
as much detail as you desire...
your experience of the
ambience and atmosphere."
of The Best Exotic
Marigold Hotel.
Words fail me.
Ah, the English wit
we love so greatly.
Thank you, madam.
See, the wheel is spinning, but,
you know, the hamster is dead.
- Mummyji what are you doing here?
- You called. I came.
No, I couldn't have called.
The phones don't work.
That's why I came.
- Wait! Mummyji this is my office!
- Who is that man out there?
The contents of that desk are mine.
Do not open the drawers.
I must insist that you
do not open the drawers.
Tell me.
Why have you come?
Do I need a reason
to visit my favorite son?
No. He's in his mansion in Delhi.
All right. My second favorite.
He went to Canada
to make his fortune.
- And make it, he did.
- As I will make mine!
I have a dream, Mummyji.
A most brilliant one.
To outsource old age.
And it is not just for the British.
There are many other countries where
they don't like old people too.
Sonny, your brothers own
one-third of this hotel each.
They're also entitled to
one-third of the profits, no?
Success does not
happen overnight, Mummyji.
This is blue-sky thinking, and it requires
long-term strategy and-and-and patience.
How is your girlfriend?
I look forward
to you meeting her.
And I look forward to your meeting
the girl you're going to marry.
She comes from a very good family
in Delhi, beta, a very good family.
I can marry as I choose, Mummyji.
I don't need anyone's permission.
I presume it is your girlfriend who tills
your head with this nonsense, huh?
A very good reason
not to marry her.
What if I love her?
An even better reason.
Now go and get Young Wasim to come
and get my luggage from the car.
He cannot carry. He has a dicky back.
Wait. Your luggage?
How long are you staying?
As long as it takes.
Dear, you won't get anywhere
sweeping like that.
I was in service for years.
Looked after a lovely house.
Kept it spotless.
You need to put more pressure on the brush.
She won't speak English.
She's what they used to call
an untouchable.
To a good Hindu,
even her shadow is polluted.
Namaste-
Where do you go every day?
ls it a woman?
Go for a curry?
Have a bit of afters?
No, no, no. I don't think so.
I'm, um-
I'm gay. Uh-
Though nowadays,
more in theory than in practice.
But I-I-I'll see you later.
[Man ] The Viceroy Club was opened
by the great Lord Kitchener himself,
and many of its fixtures have
remained unchanged since then.
Yes, I see that.
Perhaps you could tell me a
little about the clientele.
Any maharajas, wealthy
widowed landowners?
It is not the policy of this club to
divulge details of our members, madam.
- Good morning, Your Excellency.
- Very good morning.
Where do I sign up?
The admission fee
is 120,000 rupees,
and, thereafter, it will be
15,000 rupees each month.
I wonder if I might get a little
discount, owing to my status.
Your status, madam?
Yes. One was rather hoping
to fly under the radar,
but one is a member
of the royal family.
Which member, madam?
I'm Princess Margaret.
It is most certainly
an honor to meet you, madam.
And may I say
how well you look,
especially taking into account
that you died nine years ago.
Your real name please, madam,
and 120,000 rupees.
You know where he goes.
I know you know,
but you won if tell me.
I can get Hobnobs out here,
you know. I know a way.
As many as you like.
Milk or plain.
Public records office.
My mother doesn't
want us to be married.
She hasn't met me yet.
She doesn't need to meet you.
She knows you're
not from Delhi,
that you have no family money,
and you work in a call center.
You're part of a modern India
she cannot welcome.
Then you must tell her what you want.
I'm trying.
Try harder.
Do you love me, Sonny?
My feelings for you cannot
be reduced to a single word.
It's a nice word.
People like hearing it.
You know, it will be easier to talk to
my mother when the hotel is a success.
And what if it isn't?
Everything will be
all right in the end.
And if it is not all right,
then it is not yet the end.
Sonny!
It will succeed.
It has to.
Because then you can
stand up to your family?
Because then
I can stand next to you.
Are you all right,
auntie?
Uh, yes. I'm about to make the
first public speech of my life.
Imagine them naked.
Sony?
It's the way not to be scared
when speaking in public.
You imagine people naked.
Well, I'm afraid I gave that up
several years ago.
Let's see.
Oh, dear.
Excuse me, Would there be any
wealthy single men in this evening?
Uh, there is one.
Perhaps you could
seat me next to him.
This way, madam.
His Royal Highness,
Prince Michael of Kent.
I'll have that back.
Thank you very much.
Ready?
Yes.
- Ring me up.
- Ring you up-
As you would.
You know, dial my number.
It's ringing.
Hello.
Good morning, madam.
And how are you today?
Oh, no. That won't do for a start.
That's much too nursie.
I feel as if I'm on my deathbed.
if I could just take a few moments
of your time to tell you about-
How long
will you actually take?
Twelve minutes.
Then you've lied to me already.
No, I can't talk to you.
I'm watching TV.
Why does she need
12 minutes?
Well, we believe the longer we
keep our customers on the phone,
the more receptive
they'll be to our message.
It's my favorite program.
Yes, but I really think if you
heard some of our special-
No, no. Don't talk like a robot.
Now just talk to me.
You've heard
I'm watching TV.
- What are you watching?
- Oh, a marvelous program...
where a chap talks to
a panel of young women."
whose boyfriends have all
slept with their mothers.
Well, the girlfriends' mothers,
I mean, not-
Although-
Anyway, the boys have come on,
and everybody's fighting.
It sounds amazing.
Hang up right now.
- I'm Sunaina.
- Good. Now that's very good.
Evelyn. Evelyn.
Now can I speak to you
about our special offers?
Still too soon.
I obviously want to talk.
Is your husband watching
with you, Evelyn?
No, No, he died.
Um, perhaps you-
You know, I've actually had
a version of this call.
A little while ago, I talked to someone
who was so constricted by the scripts,
well, sales agenda,
that she spoke
without a trace of humanity.
As if she hadn't
realized that...
I was going completely to
pieces at the end of the phone.
You must miss him very much.
Now, sympathy's tine.
But be more optimistic.
Um, but, you know, sometimes
I ind when one door closes-
The rest of them stay shut as well.
No, you're right. Of course you're right.
It's a new beginning.
Now what do you want
to talk to me about?
There.
Three minutes?
Well, either I've saved you nine,
or I've talked myself out of a job.
I still think
you're cramping my style.
Oh, please.
You have no style to cramp.
That lady at the bar
keeps looking at me.
As one would
something in a museum.
Why must you mock?
I just want to
feel young again.
To feel needed as much as I
need, if only for one night.
One wonderful night.
Tell me you don't know
how that feels.
Give me a minute
and then come and join me.
Rejected again.
Many years ago that man over there gave me
the most extraordinary night of my life.
To describe his bedroom skill
as technique would-
- Those drinks not ready yet?
- They say patience is passion tamed.
- I'm Madge.
- Carol.
And this is Norman.
How do you do?
Carol. As in Christmas.
- I suppose.
- Great.
So what brings you
to Jaipur, Carol?
Yes, Carol. What, uh-
What brings you to Jaipur?
Actually, I've lived here all my life.
My father worked for the foreign office.
- You're very Ht.
- Beg your pardon?
- Oh, God.
- You look like you keep yourself in good shape, physically.
Well- I
did join a gym last year.
It cost a fortune,
and I didn't get any fitter.
Apparently, you actually have to go.
Ah!
So, um,
what do you do, Norman?
- Me?
- Yes.
Norman's in business.
Well, I- Yes.
- What business?
- You tell her.
Import-export.
Although nowadays, there's
rather more than im."
- If you know what I mean.
- No, I'm afraid I don't.
I have to go and splash
some water on my face.
Please, God,
I drown in it.
Well, look. It's been lovely chatting.
No, it hasn't.
No, it hasn't.
But I really have to go.
Look, Carol, Carol.
Can we drop
all this pretense?
Start again?
I'm not charming.
I'm not good at repartee. And-
My name's Norman,
and I'm lonely.
My name's Carol, So am I.
Day 22.
Like Darwin's finches, we are
slowly adapting to our environment.
And when one does adapt
my Goa!
the riches that are available.
There is no past that we can
bring back by longing for it
Only a present that builds and creates
itself as the past withdraws.
Didn't sleep a wink last night.
The tap in there never stopped dripping,
Ah. I spoke to Young Wasim
about that.
- What did he say?
- No idea. It was in Hindi.
- I thought I might fix it myself.
- You? When?
Well, no time
like the present.
Where is this? Where are we?
Janta Colony, Kachchi Basti.
Well, what happened
to my usual route?
Anokhi has invited you
to her home.
Who's Anokhi?
The one who brings
your food.
She wants you to meet
her family.
How soon can I leave?
She wants to thank you
for your kindness.
I haven't been kind.
You are the only one
that acknowledges her.
I'm not eating that.
You will insult her
very deeply if you do not.
It's good.
Oh!
Get off there!
The little bastards! Get off!
Get up! Get 'em off there!
Get 'em off me-
Ah.
I- I di-
I didn't know they were playing. I-
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
How much for this piece?
One thousand rupees.
Thank you.
No, no, no, no.
Forgive me. Forgive me. No, no.
That's, um- That's not how it works.
Uh, sorry to butt in.
But, uh, you don't ask him how much he wants.
You just tell him how much you'll pay.
She'll give you, uh- She'll give you 200.
Absolutely no more, final offer.
One thousand rupees.
Pity,
Walk away. Now walk away.
Oh, but-
I know what I'm doing.
- The thing is I really wanted to buy that.
- He'll come after us.
Do you think so?
Absolutely.
This is how the game is played.
Just keep on walking.
He's playing it very cool,
but he'll come.
Ah.
He's playing it
very, very, um, cool.
850, 900, 950, 1,000.
Thank you.
Sure.
You'll get him next time.
Why are you carrying a tap?
You see, what I think, and
of course, I'm no expert,
is that the gland nut has
come away from the spindle,
so it needs to be
tightened and resealed.
