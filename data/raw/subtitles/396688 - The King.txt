King Palace, Coimbatore
He's Raja Ravichandra Varma.
A good business man.
He believed in business
which not only earns profits
but also gives jobs
to the jobless.
His three sisters mean
everything to him.
And these three men are those
who married Raja's three sisters.
Raja loves his sisters whereas
these three men love Raja's wealth.
He is Raja's brother-in-law,
an absent minded man.
But he is a good man too.
After Raja's death, his children
became the point of attraction.
Bhagat Seth,
a criminal minded business man.
Earlier, he was a professional killer.
Now he is a business man.
You start.
No one has come from
King constructions.
After Raja's death, who's left
to represent the company.
Raja's elder son.
Has this kid entered the business?
- Yes sir.
You can start.
Government's minimum bid
amount is Rs.10 lakhs.
Rs.10 lakhs & 10 thousand.
Rs.50 lakhs.
Bhagat construction bid
is Rs.2 crores 2 lakhs.
One moment King.
Business is not a ball game.
But for me, it is just a game.
Didn't get me?
This spinning mill which isn't
worth even Rs.50 lakhs,
l provoked you & made you
to bid for Rs.2 crores.
And l made workers to earn
a profit Rs.1 .5 crores.
A real King not only wins
but also one who
makes people win.
l won.
Well done.
Why do you congratulate your elder son
when the younger one had won it?
He lost to make him win.
A real King not only wins
but also one who
makes people win.
Have you lost the suitcases?
Tell me.
Please stop it.
Tell me where have you
hidden the suitcases?
Why are you beating him?
l should kill him.
Your brother trusted him so much
but he is trying to cheat us.
What did he do?
Tomorrow is Raja's birth anniversary.
He says that the money brought in boxes
to be given as bonus to the workers
have gone missing.
Don't get angry.
lf police interrogate...
Stop it, uncle.
Sir, l'm innocent.
Just leave this place.
Do you also suspect me?
l said leave this place.
Just leave this place l say.
When he mentioned about the police,
l really got scared.
l got much more scared.
Where did you keep the suitcases?
Don't worry.
They are safe in my room.
Did we steal it to be
hidden in your room?
Go, get it.
- l will.
l know about you all and
Ranga Rao's honest nature.
l kept my mouth shut
because of my sisters.
You don't have to worry about
any affairs of the palace.
Come with me & seek
forgiveness from Ranga Rao.
After his father's death, we thought
we could gain control of the wealth,
but he's an hurdle everything.
What do we do when someone
becomes a hurdle in our path?
We take another path.
You guys do that.
What about you?
We remove it from our path.

Mother...
After my elder son's birth,
something inauspicious
happens every 3 years.
l called you here to
show his horoscope.
This boy will lead a royal life
and will face some hurdles too.
ln the 2008, a danger awaits him.
Very dangerous.
lf he escapes from that,
he will live long.
What should we do as a remedy
to avoid that danger?
As humans, let's do all that we can.
2008, March 26
Move...
How did it happen?
The contract will be ours for sure.
Don't under estimate the King.
What will he do?
l've bribed everyone.
lt's Murthy...
Yes Murthy, tell me.
Sorry sir. A bad news.
King has won again.
What happened?
King has won again!
l'll even kill the King to win this time.
lt's wrong.
As his bodyguard,
you failed to save him.
You've no right to live.
My son, you wanted King to die
until your death.
Notjust the King,
l'll wipe out his entire clan.
Hello brother...
Only if you come to the airport
and give me a send off,
l'll board the flight to London.
lf you don't come, you know
about me, don't you?
l'll come back.
My name is Kittu, Coal Kittu.
This is my business.
And my side business
is to kill for money.
Now l took money to kill you.
Are you scared?
Notjust me, no one in
my family ever gets scared.
Do you know why?
Everyone believes in God,
who is unseen.
We believe in God we see.
God you see?
Who are you?
- King!
Let me see how King saves you now.
Kill him.

Who are you?
- King
The way he spoke about you
made me anxious to see you.
Electricity gives light.
lf you try to touch it,
you will die.
You dared to warn me in my den,
do you know my gift to you for it?
Your brother's death as you watch.
lf anyone of you dare touch my brother,
l'll leave this place right away.
Try if you can.
Get up.
Get up.
Take this.
Touch him.
Touch him l say.
Who gave you money?
King knows to protect his people
and also knows how to
control men like you.
l'm not here to tell you
not to lock horns with me.
Lock horns with me
but not with my people.
lf you again think
about my people,
l'll be forced to think about you.
You can't stand before me.
Why are you so dull?
ls it because my brother
has gone to London?
No.
She doesn't want you to leave.
Yes.
The priest had predicted this year
is not good for you.
You don't have to travel now.
Munna called me just now, mother.
There's a small problem
in our factory.
l've to go there to solve it.
l'll be back in 2 days.
After our brother's death,
you're our only hope.
Nothing will happen to me when
l'm protected by your love.
Actually...
Gopi said that you're leaving.
Your aunt wants a golden girdle.
Gold prices have come
down by Rs.1000.
lf you give me Rs.5 lakhs...
You'll bet on Pakistan and
Australian cricket teams.
l've quit betting.
Tell him.
You don't trust lndia.
l don't trust you.
He hates lies.
Ask him money point blank.
He won't deny us, will he?
l won't.
l know about you all.
l spared you all because
of my aunts.
Go & do your work.
When he has made it so clear,
why stand here like dogs?
Let's go.
- Finish off all your work & come back.
Do you need a girdle?
lf l need anything
l would ask you not him.
He is lying.
Well said.
Hope you have not forgotten anything?
You forgot.
Forgot what?
Forgot to wear your pant.
Sorry. l forgot to wear
my pant in hurry.
Anything message to your mother?
- Will you forget?
Why would l?
Tell my mother that
l'll come back safe & sound.
Okay.
He told me to tell his mother that
he will backsafe & sound.
Hubby...
Why did you shriek now?
- You didn't wear you pant.
Yes.
What did he say?
- How will l know?
Yes, you're right.
What did he say?
He said something.
King has tightened the grip.
Das from whom we borrowed money
is threatening us if we don't repay.
What should we do now?
This phone keeps on ringing.
lt's Das.
He will live for 100 years.
Yes, he will live for 100 years.
lf you don't pay the loan,
this is your last year.
Stop scaring me.
lt's betting Shafi.
Shafi, l'll bet on Australia this time too.
Won't you answer my call,
you scoundrel?
Mr.Das, is it you?
How did you call from this number?
l'm in Delhi.
l thought of meeting you
in person once l reach there.
So, l cut the call.
Agra Peda is special sweet here,
can l get it for you?
lf you were in Delhi,
how did you hear the gun sound?
Where are you, Mr.Das?
Wherever l may be,
you're at my gun point.
What would you get if you kill me?
Give me some time.
l've made a foolproof sketch.
lf you miss, l won't shoot
the bulb this time.
lt'll be your brain.
What do you mean by foolproof sketch?
l won't tell you.
l'll put it in action.
King who went to Uttaranchal
will not come back.
l'm hearing this from
the day l got married.
Will he finish the job?
lf not him...
Will you finish the job?
Have you made any master plan?
Date: March 26
Location:Dehardun Airport, Uttaranchal
This phone is disturbing me.
The flight landed just now.
You're new to the job.
Handle with care.
He's very smart.
Don't make me tensed.
l'll handle the situation.
What's the problem?
Local mafia threatened the workers
and are stopping from working.
They want to takeover the factory.
You don't need to run this
factory fighting those men.
We feel it's better to
shutdown the factory.
When 3000 families are affected
because of a few men,
we need to finish them off instead
of shutting down the factory.
They are very dangerous.
A soldier can fear war
but not a King.

His walking style is rocking...
His shoe sound is shaking...
His speed is breath taking...
He knocks down men
with his powerful fists...
His enemies get shivers...
His punches are like
bursting crackers...
Even guns take a step back
on seeing him...
He comes like a cyclone
and breaks all records...
King is coming...
A king with brawn and
with a kind heart...
Even silence blows whistles
at the one & only King...

When he enters the battlefield,
he over runs everyone...
When he tightens his fists,
he strikes hard...
He is a walking army...
Everything is a cakewalk to him...
When he starts to hunt the beasts,
there's no stepping back...
He even electrifies
the electricity...
He is known for his adventures...
He is too hot...

His eyes are like a cheetah,
always stalking...
When injustice is done,
he attacks ferociously...
He leads from the front, our king...
He caretakes everyone
single handedly...
Solves any problems he faces...
When such a hero is with people,
they all like him...
Location: Windrock Valley, King Estates
Date: March 29 Time: 10.20 am

lt's getting late to the flight.
l'm waiting in the hotel.
Where are you?
- ln graveyard.
Graveyard...?
A day after King's death,
Victoria Hospital
You had lodged a complaint
about a missing man, right?
Yes sir.
Try to identify him.
ls he the one?
- No.
ls he the one?
- No.
ls he the one?
ls he the one?
What?
Has he gone missing?
l searched everywhere.
l've lodged a complaint
in all police stations.
But no information about him.
How will you get information?
What do you mean?
King who went to Uttaranchal
will not come back.
King who went to Uttaranchal
will not come back.
King who went to Uttaranchal
will not come back.
He is finished.
What is all this?
An evidence to your plot.
lnspector...
DCP!
Put him in jail and give
him a police treatment.
Truth will come out.
Mr. Appaji, you've to come to
the police station with us.
l will come.
l've many evidences against you.
l'll show you all.
Move.
He may really bring.
He has escaped.
How far can he run with
his big tummy?
Search. You'll find him.
l now understood the meaning
of your cunning smile.
You finished the King there
and trapped Appaji here.
Moreover a cunning smile too.
Let's ask your younger son
to come back.
No.
He can't tolerate it.
My son will be fine.
You don't have to worry.
l gave them hope.
But you are my hope.
Make sure my son is
back home safe.
Safe...?
Safe...?
Sister, your son told me that
he will come home safe
and wanted you not to worry.
l know.
He will come.
God will bring him back to us.
Old City, Hyderabad
Greetings sir.
Why have you come back again?
Didn't l tell you that l'll not vacate?
Your lease period is over.
He has to perform his
daughter's marriage.
lf you vacate this bar,
he will sell this bar and
perform his daughter's marriage.
Who are you to say that?
- Bottu Seenu's man.
Who the hell is Bottu Seenu?
Get out. Get out.
Who are you?
East side, Marredpalli,
West side Kukatpalli,
North side Kompalli,
South side Upparapalli,
all round Hyderabad, is there anyone
who doesn't know 'Bottu' Seenu?
What Bottu Seenu?
Do you know Charminar?
- Yes.
Golconda...?
- Yes.
Birla Mandir...?
- Yes.
Don't you know Bottu Seenu?
- No.
l'll give you a clue.
lf Bottu Seenu hits, your head reels.
- l see?
Do you have any doubt?
lt's reeling.
l'm Bottu Seenu.
lf someone asks me who l am,
they will regret for asking so.
This building owner made a deal
with me to vacate this place.
lf you don't vacate he'll feel bad.
lf he feels bad, l'll get hurt.
What if you get hurt?
This will be the result.
Just vacate this place.
What's going on?
Look, he is hitting me badly.
l told you to vacate it.
How dare you say that
infront of the police?
l'll gun you down.
l'm sorry. Leave me.
- Go.
Let's go, boys.
Let's go.
Don't get scared.
lt was a drama.- Drama?
Everything was dummy.
- You're really great.
Enough of praising him.
Get me the money.
Rs.10000.
Rs.10000?
lt'll not even cover costumes & drinks.
- Give me more.
Don't be so money minded.
We helped in his daughter's marriage.
lf you hadn't done thatjob for free,
we all would've gone to touch.
Touch...?
- l mean Pub.
Pub is full of girls.
Drink & enjoy.
You forgot about my marriage
but want to enjoy in pub?
l'm trying my best.
ls it to ruin my marriage?
The profession we are in,
no one is coming forward
to give his daughter to you.
We can't change our profession.
But we can change our looks & styles.
There's a right time for everything.
- lt has started raining.
Shravani, don't get wet in rain.
Come here.
Don't drag us out.
What happened?
l saw a girl in the rain.
l've gone mad.
Girl...? Where?
She went in the bus.
Let her go.
lf not her someone else.
l've decided, l want that girl.
lt's okay that you've decided.
Where can we find her?
lf Bottu Seenu decides, it's done.
Now take a look.
How is it?
l don't know what it is!
What?
lt's really wonderful.
lt looks like a real dog.
When l paint a dog,
it will look like a dog.
Will it look like you?
Show that to the dog?
lt'll feel happy.
How is your painting?
You kept on moving.
Else it would've been better.
Master will be stunned to see this.
- Yes boss.
Why is it barking?
lt must be thinking that
another dog has come here.
Boss...stop it.
Khairtabad is going out of our hands.
You tell me.
How is the painting?
You tell me.
- Making fun of me? lt's a dog.
You call this a dog?
You scribbles some lines and
these fellows praise you.
Why should we try something
that we don't know?
To hell with painting of a dog, a fox!
Let's talk about Khairtabad.
l liked it.
lnsulting art?
l will crush your neck.
Forgive me, boss. Leave me.
l might die.
l spared you because you were
with me from childhood.
What's your problem?
Someone named Bottu Seenu
is into running kangaroo courts.
lf this goes on,
what will happen to our reputation?
How dare he runs kangaroo court
in my area?
Where can l find him?
Boss, you be here.
l will take care of him.
Who is Bottu Seenu here?
How dare you run kangaroo court
in our area?
l'll chop you into pieces.

l heard that you run kangaroo courts.
Khairtabad is mine.
ls Nizam area your
grand mother's property?
Hello boss Gyan. You?
Narasimha..?
- Yes. He is my son.
Let's go inside & talk.
The twin cities must do what l say.
l threaten them and
l get protection money.
How could you dare step
into my business?
lt means competition.
Just by hitting a few people
doesn't mean you're a big shot.
l've come across many guys like you.
Police wet their pants on seeing me.
Our boxer Ashok is being beaten
to pulp at SR Nagar police station.
Tell my name.
They are beating him badly
after telling your name.
Our boss will talk later.
What about you?
lf you do business here,
should l open a bangle shop for a living?
You do it knowingly or unknowingly.
lf you wish to be a goon,
work for me.
l won't work for anyone.
What is he saying?
He is very arrogant.
He listens to no one.
l've dealt with many
such arrogant people.
You're Narasimha's son,
take Khairtabad & 100/0 commission.
Have l come top you or
you've come to me?
l came to your place.
Then the choice is mine.
- Yours?
You take that 100/0.
How dare he talks to me like that?
He is very arrogant.
Never listens to anyone.
What a son you've, Narasimha!
l'm quiet because of you.
As you say. But to the outside world,
be it the other way round.
Why?
They don't know about
our relationship.
They might feel that
l'm afraid of you. Tell him.
Yes.
- Okay.
Yadi, bring that here.
This is what l gave you, right?
l have brought you a gift.
- What gift?
Open it. You will know.
What is this?
- A painting.
You call this a painting?
lt's like a drunkard scribbling.
Who painted this?
l've never come across
a worst painting than this.
What are you doing?
My boss painted it.
Shut up. Take his comments positively.
Narasimha...
- Yes
Our building in Khairtabad
is really good.
You can shift there.
You too boys.
What shift?
That place is full of pigs & rats.
lf we clean it,
it will look wonderful.
Bye Narasimha.
- Bye.
Bye Seenu. Take care.
Bottu Narasimha fell on my feet
and embarrassed me.
l pitied him, told him to handle Khairtabad
and take 100/0 commission.
Why 100/0 commission?
He needs something to survive, right?
He does the crime and
we get the commission.
Did he agree for 100/0?
- Good question.
l've settle your account.
When l was threatening them,
you came & said our boys were being
beaten to pulp in SR police station.
l beg you. Don't beat me.
l won't beat you.
- Thank you.
l will break your bones.
You said there are pigs
in that building.
You must clean the entire building.
From now, my boss has given powers
to Seenu to take care of Khairtabad.
He didn't give power.
We took it from him.
He is Mental Rajesh.
- Greetings.
He committed many crimes from
childhood, made a lot of money.
He set up a wine shop there.
The problems start there.
Women stage protests since their
husbands don't give them money.
ls he a fool to have invested
so much money in it?
Apart from your childhood crimes,
you have set up a wine shop.
lt's him not me.
You take their hard earned money
before it reaches their families.
You take their lives selling illicit liquor.
- Where are they?
Tell me.
lf you listen his story, you roll
on the ground & cry.- Really?
His father-in-law promised to give
him Rs.2 lakhs before marriage.
He gave him Rs.1 lakh only.
And is refusing to pay balance Rs.1 lakh.
He got angry & beat his wife and
smashed his wife's head to the wall.
Her father wants to file a case
against him. lt's injustice.
Do you need dowry for your dirty face?
- He married her not me.
Are you trying to ruin her life?
Where are they?
They are gone.
Do you have only such cases with you?
Only such things come up for settlement.
Settlement is not for us
to get settled in life.
lf you bring such stupid cases to me,
l'll kick your ass.
Why is everyone so tensed?
- Sir is coming.
The entire city is scared of our boss.
But our boss is scared of Sir.
ls our boss scared of him?
- Shut up.
Our boss fell in love
with his sister.
She said her's is a family of artists.
And his' family of killers.
She put a condition that only if he
learns to paint & satisfies her brother,
she'll agree to marry him.
Have you finished your home work?
- You have to see it.
l spent all night to paint this.
You spoke like a great artist.
What is this?
Merciful sky.
Caption of the painting.
The boy in the painting
is an orphan.
He has no food or water.
Not even clothes to wear.
lt's alright. Doesn't he have ears?
- He is deaf.
Won't the deaf have ears?
l can't convey in the painting
that he is deaf.
So, l removed his ears.
So, since you've no brains,
can l remove your head?
Go ahead.
When he feels hungry,
he looks down.
When he feels thirsty,
he looks at the sky.
Finally, the sky feels pity on him.
lt releases 3 drops of water.
Your creation has lot of shit in it.
lt's not enough if you alone
understand that shit.
The one who looks at it
must also understand.
lt's very clear in the painting.
What's clear?
- Boss...
What? Why are you disturbing us?
- lmportant matter, sir.
This is even more important.
You illiterate!
You say that this is very clear, right?
Yes master. lt's crystal clear.
Tell me the concept of this painting.
Tell me.
This boy came here to shit.
Forgot to bring water mug.
He's looking at those leaves
to wipe his shit.- That's all.
Don't feel bad.
You too have some shitty
thoughts in your brain.
When they come out,
they turn even worse.
What can l do?
When l paint, my hands shake.
- Stop drinking.
How is drinking related to painting?
Your hands will stop shaking
and you can paint well.
Try again.
Will see you tomorrow.
What did you say?
ls he waiting to wipe the shit
with those leaves?
l'm sorry, boss.
Tell me what's in your heart.
l'll tell him exactly as you say.
ls he a fool to ask you again?
- Leave it.
Bottu Seenu is spoiling
all our business.
He is conquering Khairtabad.
He is taking huge sums of money.
He is troubling us.
People trust banks & deposit
their money in banks.
lf people use credit cards & refuse to pay,
banks will be forced to shutdown.
lnnocent people will the final losers.
ln Khairtabad alone, more than
Rs.15 crores is due for our bank.
lf you recover that money,
l will give you 100/0.
More than the commission,
l like yourjob. Deal okay.
We will be on it from tomorrow.
He gave me a wrong information
that you're spoiling the business.
l like your style of business.
Very happy.
There should be honesty
in the business l do.
My boss wants money notjustice.
lf we do wrong things for
the sake of money,
the affected people will
be angry with your boss.
That's dangerous for you.
lf we deal such cases,
we get money & a good image.
What do you say?
- Nothing to say.
We'll never interfere in your business.
Do business in your style.
Bye Narasimha.
- Bye sir.
Let's go.
You convey everything wrong.
There, you insulted me
in front of my master.
And here, you say that
l'm very greedy.
What shall we do with him?
l beg you. Treat me as
your brother. Leave me.
l won't leave you.
l will finish you off.
Vehicle is very good.
- New model, boss.
Boys, have you understood?
The dealing must be very smooth.- Okay boss.
Don't say boss. Say okay bro.
Bro means brother, corporate style.
Who are you?
l'm coming from the bank.
- Have you brought it?
What?
l applied for the credit card.
Have you brought it?
l'm here to take not to give.
- Take what?
Credit card bill.
- Bill.
There is no outgoing
only incoming here.
Which means that l only take money.
l never give money.
l may have to take
legal action against you.
Legal action?
l'll complain to TV9 that you
brought goons to my house.
l'll lodge complaint in police station
that you misbehaved with women.
When a lender is so smart,
how smart a defaulter like would be?
Do you need a credit card?
Yes. l need one.
My repayment record is very clean.
l do prompt payment.
You come here fast.
l am waiting for you.
Why are you taking my belongings?
Why are you taking my car?
Why are you hitting me?
First, l'll deal very smoothly
in a corporate style.
lf it doesn't work, Bottu Seenu will be out.
- Who is Bottu Seenu?
lf Bottu Seenu hits you,
your head will reel.- How?
How was it?
l feel the reeling.
You must be Bottu Seenu.- Got it?
Pay money & take your belongings.
Load everything.
l think l spoke a lot.

Which floor is he in?
- 3rd floor.
Can't you see?
- My girl friend.
Girl friend for you?
Give me your goggles.
lt'll be nice on you. Get lost.
What's this noise?
- Today is Valentine's day.
Today, if girls accept flowers from boys,
it means she has accepted his love.
l don't believe all these.
These stuff is for those with
lot of money. Let's go.
Among the shoppers who did
shopping in our mall today,
first prize winner is token no. 153.
What are you looking at, boss?
The girl l saw in the bus stop.
Your name?
- Shravani.
Sister-in-law's name is Shravani.
Nice name, right?
- Yes boss.
What will you do with this Rs.25000?
l request you to donate it to any
orphanage on my behalf.- Wow!
She is too good.
On this valentine's day, you're giving
this money to an orphanage.
What are you going to give
to your boy friend?
Sorry, l've no boy friend.
Boss...
- She has no boy friend.
Can you tell us the kind of
a man you're looking for?
He must be kind hearted.
lt's okay.
Must be a follower of Gandhi.
- Boss.
Should make his dreams come true.
None of her expectations matches your.
- Forget about her.
She caught your balloon.
She holds your flower which means
your love will be a success.
Shut up. He never believes
in all that stuff.
Now l do.
- Boss, she is leaving.
We thank you all for making
this program a grand success.
We missed her again.
l didn't miss her.
She is in my heart.

l searched all over AP...
l explored both Hollywood
and Bollywood...
l fell for an angel like you...
You're my sweetheart...
l'm looking for a boy friend
like Brad Pitt...
l need a man like Jet Li...
lf you prove that you're a man
with both qualities...
you'll be my Emperor...
O beauty! You're my love...
l'm mad at you...
To be my hero,
my heart should believe in you...

We are a perfect match...
Like Amitabh & Jaya,
a made for each other couple...
We are a perfect match
like Rajesh & Dimple...
lf you say Yes,
let's get married like Abhi & Ash...
The man who Jaya loves
was No: 1 ...
The man Dimple fell for was
a romantic hero...
Ash liked the qualities of Bachchan...
Do something to prove yourself
as someone special...
O my dear Trisha!
l'm a slave of your beauty...
Love is an intoxication...
One should be mad like you...

Like Ambani,
l'll build a palace for you...
Like Shahjahan,
l'll gift you the Rose Mahal as a bonus.
Like ANR, l'll build
a studio in your name...
lf you love me,
l'll make you the next CM...
Wearing a buttonless shirt,
you look like mass hero...
On looking at your kind heart,
you proved to be a man of class...
Like Majnu,
you cast a spell on me...
You made my heart beat
to your tunes...
Darling, you're my dawn...
what you said is the
sweetest thing of all...
O my darling! O handsome!
l like you...
Take rest for a few minutes.
We will get ready.
Hello...Record it.
- Okay.
How is it?
- As it is.
l mean to say that this is the
song we heard in our car.
lf we give the CD, our boys will
compose the tunes.- Shut up.
The tempo is different.
The tune is different.
The language is...
lt was in Hindi.
This is Telugu.
Greetings sir.
Shravani, he is Jayasurya.
Greetings sir.
Ask that girl in blue dress
to come in.
Let's give her a break.
Greetings sir.
- Sit down.
Your name?
- Shravani.
There is music in your name.
See Shravani, to be frank,
l know nothing about music.
How is that possible?
By stealing other composers' tunes.
l heard it.
To come up in the industry,
all you need is a relationship.
Especially, the relationship
between a singer & musician
must be like that of
a husband & wife.
You...
l mean to say that we should've
a good understanding.
Let's forget about music
and stuff like that.
Let's talk about life.
Book a guest house in the evening.
Send our car to her house.
She will come.- Okay sir.
Understood?
l understood very well.
l wish to beat you with slipper.
But l respect your age.
l trust my talent not you.
Shall l book the guest house?
Swaranjali
Greetings. Welcome to
Tata lndicom's Swaranjali.
Among the selected semi-finalists,
the great music director Jayasurya
has come to select the finalists.
Our 1st participant is Shruthi
from Srikakulam.
l'm going to sing the song from
film 'Saagara Sangamam'.
Om Nama Shivaya...
Written by Veturi,
music by llayaraja.
Our Raja.
When l worked under him,
l used to call him Rajaji.
He too liked me very much.
He always use to say that if l was born earlier,
he wouldn't have survived in this field.
That's why you're copying his tunes.
l heard that.

What tune did you sing?
- Hindolam raga.
Hindolam means Sa Ri Ga Ma.
How did you sing?
Sa Ga Ma Da.
- Where is Ri?
There is no Ri in Hindolam.
Yes, there is no Ri.
But it's traces should be in the song.
That's magic.
Such small mistakes do happen.
We too have committed such mistakes
before coming up in life.
Correct it in the finals.
Our next contestant is
Shravani from Hyderabad.
l'm going to sing a song from
the film 'Shankarabharanam'.
Samaja Varagamana...
Written by Veturi, Thyagaraja Keerthana
Music by K.V. Mahadevan.
My uncle's song.
l've a bond with this particular song.
Don't say that you composed
music for this song.
We stayed in golden beach to
compose tunes for Shankarabharanam.
You know about Vishwanath.
He never accepts anything in first go.
Sometimes we used to sit till 2 am.
Those days, we were so dedicated.
Uncle was humming like this...
l said that the tune is ready.
And he made the tune.
He values my judgement.
You must be very brave to
have selected that song.
Don't keep changing the channels.
Give me the remote.
Wait.
- What happened?
That's the girl whom l mentioned about.
What are you singing?
What is the tempo of the
song you're singing?
Do you know the value of that song?
lt's a romantic song between
Chandramohan & Rajalakshmi.
Where is the romance?
What l mean to say is that a man
who is hungry shouts differently
and the man who is hurt
shouts differently.
Every thing has a unique tune.
lnstead of concentrating on your clothes,
you could've concentrated on the song.
Sometimes, l fear that Telugu film
songs have come to an end.
Don't kill music director's creativity
with your half baked knowledge.
Don't disappoint us who want
to give you a good break.
We want to take you to greater heights.
But you remain where you are.
You never come there.
You mean guest house.
Atleast show some dedication
in the finals.
l'm ready to give you a break.
Why did you get tensed?
l thought you might die.
Are you disappointed that l didn't die?
You were emotional and
spoke too much.
Wait for the reaction.
My heart is overjoyed
in your thoughts.
My heart has crossed the boundaries
of love with your looks.
Stop it.
What's that language?
Even l couldn't understand it.
How will people understand it?
People will understand.
- Shut up.
Making fun of me!
Can we send those track singing girls?
Aren't they taking money?
Are they singing for free?
lf they need any favour, they must ask me?
Who are you in the middle?
lf they ask you a favour,
they know what you will ask them.
Get lost.
Sing something in our style.
- Okay master.
Sing.
O girl! You opened the
doors of your heart.
Someone has come to see you.
Let them in.
- Okay sir.
lt must be that girl!
How is the reaction?
She came to me running.
O girl! You opened the
doors of your heart.
Girl...girl...
Replace girl with thatch...
O thatch! You unlocked your heart.
O thatch! You unlocked your heart.
ls this also a settlement case?
- No, a personal case.
Greetings sir.
Who are you guys?
Your fans.
- Fans?
Khairtabad Jayasurya youth association.
When did you start this?
- Just now.
A few days back,
a group of people came here
and promised to throw flowers
when my name appears in the titles,
and took Rs.25000.
They didn't even clap.
We aren't like them.
- So, what are you then?
They took but didn't clap hands.
But we will clap without taking money.
Then okay.
Sit here.
What brings you here?
- l will tell you.
On your birthday...
Will you distribute free food?
- No. Blood donation.
All over Andhra Pradesh.
My blessings are with you always.
- We need your blood not blessings.
Whose?
- Yours.
l will tell you.
Close the doors.
We have decided to donate
your blood all over the state.
Who are you to donate my blood?
Who are you to steal other's tunes?
Why are you hitting me?
Why are you hitting me?
Why are you hitting me?
Understood?
lf you raise a question,
my answer will be this.
So, shut up & do as l say.
What should l do?
- Make a tune.
Write lyrics to that tune,
sing that song & try to impress us.
Okay.
Hey, B22.
We must drink & breathe Telugu.
Drink & enjoy.
The gardener's head should break...
Trying to cheat me just like you
cheat producers & directors?
What did l do?
Why are you in a hurry?
l will tell you.
Sing the original song of this tune.
Do you understand now,
why l slapped you?
Yes, l do.
Understood what?
You want something new from me.
Start.
l didn't expect you to have
such good music knowledge.
Don't try to act smart.
Sing your own song.
By God's grace l didn't have to
make my own tune till now.
Now try.
l can't compose a tune suddenly.
What are you talking?
Don't keep hitting me.
l composed a beautiful tune before
becoming a music director.
l never gave it to anyone.
No one took that tune.
l'll dedicate it to you now.
- Go ahead.

What happened sir?
The tempo is different.
The tune is different.
What are you singing?
What is the tempo of the
song you're singing?
At times, l fear that Telugu film
music is in its last days.
Your fans want to take
you to greater heights.
But you insist to stay here.
You never try to come there.
l understood.
You're not my fans.
Her fans.
You're very sharp.
That's why you caught the point so late.
Did you understand?
- Yes sir.
That girl in the finals...
You don't have to tell everything.
Watch the remaining part on TV.
You will come up in life.
Hope my life doesn't end.
lt depends on your behaviour.
l didn't expect so much reaction.
Take your bank receipt.
Seenu paid your credit card due.
He warned you not to
take any more loans.
Okay sir.
Why is she here?
You must be Shravani who reached
the semifinal in Swaranjali.
People know me.
Yes.
Finals will start in a few hours.
Why are you still here?
l'm not participating in finals.
Boss, sister-in-law is not
going to the program.
ls it?
Where is she now?
Are you blind?
Shravani...!
Yes.
Are you also my fan?
Notjust an ordinary fan.
A very big fan.
l couldn't pay for the
SMS's l sent for you.
So, my outgoing got cut.
The program is being shot there.
Why are you still here?
Go immediately.
l'm fed up explaining to all my fans.
l'm not participating
in that program.
That's all.
Boss, l'm Jayasurya speaking.
lt's getting late for the program.
That girl hasn't come.
What should l do now?
Postpone the program.
lt's nice, ah?
Move...move...
Why are you in a hurry?
Can't you be careful enough?
Shravani's program is about to
start on TV, so...
So, l was in a hurry.
Are you also her fan just like me?
- Yes sir.
As her fan, what are you doing here?
A bad news for all her fans.
- What?
She is not participating in it.
l had so many dreams.
lf what you're saying is true,
l wish to lie on the railway tracks & die.
Take me to the railway tracks.
- You don't need to.
She will sing.
You don't worry.
She will sing for fans like us.
You don't worry.
Go.
Make sure she sings.
Shravani, you shouldn't cry.
You must wipe out the tears
of your fans.
lt was you l first dreamed about.
lt's you who is infront of my eyes.
O dreams! Tell me whether
you'll come true.
O heart! What is she?
A silence or a beautiful song?
So close yet so far.
Won't you be mine, O friend!
You call this a song?
What lyric is that?
What we gave him wasn't
enough l think?
lt was wonderful. Fantastic.
She is very different from
the semi final presentation.
She is like Goddess Saraswathi herself.
That's all.
lt's not my success.
lt belongs to my fans who gave
me courage & sent me here.
Do you think it's for your song?
Fans! Don't waste time.
lf you want to do some good
things on behalf of me,
like blood donation,
l request them through
this program to do it.
Boss, don't entertain such things.
- Leave it.
He is feeling shy.
Uncle, did you get all the details
of the person who comes now?
Secretariat Gopal Rao
recommended this boy.
You will find fault in everyone.
Just don't mind it.
Don't quarrel with anyone.
Deal carefully.
- Okay boss.
To me, marriage is like betel leaves.
Life will turn colourful only if betel, nut
and calcium mix in right proportions.
lf not, your life will burn
like your mouth.
Right?
- Yes.
Since you're very cautious,
l pit the one marrying you.
You don't have to fear.
A Cupid will come for her.
l know. Come inside.
Come in. Sit.
Settle it immediately.
How many more should've to come?
You won't have such problem.
You're being refereed by
Secretariat Gopal Rao.
You will be my first preference.
You & the girl must meet.
Both should agree.
And get married.
Do you think l'm here for
bride seeing ceremony?
Yes, l think.
You?
Yes, it's me.
Do you know him?
Yes, uncle.
He is my fan.
What's your name?
Didn't you tell her my details?
l did tell her.
But she might have forgotten.
His name is Sharat.
What's your occupation?
Haven't you told her even this?
l did tell her.
Software engineer.
Where?
Haven't you told her even this?
l did tell her.
Don't get angry.
He is working as software engineer
in Tata lndicom.
Now l'll tell her everything in one shot.
- Okay.
As Secretariat Gopal Rao said,
l'm working as Software Engineer
in Tata lndicom.
My name is Sharat.
Let's be friends for sometime.
Only then l will know your
good & bad qualities.
And you will know about
my good & bad qualities.
lt looks like a big process.
Really?
ls it?
Okay. l will take care.
What happened, uncle?
lt's about credit card people.
They will lure us with a sweet voice
to take credit card.
Once taken, then they threaten us.
Moreover, they have hired
goons for collection.
ls this fair?
- No.
The real Sharat must have come.
lt must be them.
Shall l deal with them?
No thanks.
l will handle them.
l can manage them.
l'll talk to them.
Let me talk to them.
Sharat, leave him.
lt's usual for him.
You sit down.
l'm Sharat.
Who cares?
lt's me.
l know who you are & why you're here.
lt will not work out. Go away.
You asked me to come here.
You came because l invited you.
Now l'm telling you to go. Go.
How could you address me
without any respect?
l'm like this.
l won't give you any respect.
What can you do?
Not here. l will inquire
in the secretariat.
Excuse me.
Do you think l will get scared
on hearing the secretariat name?
Secretariat Gopal is my close friend.
He might be your friend.
But he is my relative.
Actually, Gopal Rao...
Will you ask him to put this man in jail?
Won't you leave him even after that?
What are you talking?
Actually Gopal Rao...
There is no one called Gopal Rao here.
You get inside.
Come here.
l would've died in suffocation.
l should tell him that l'm the boy
whom Gopal Rao has sent.
You should not.
- Why?
Have you ever fallen in love?
lf l really had, why would l come
here to see this girl?- l fell in love.
With whom?
The girl you came to see.
Does she love you?
lf she loves me,
why would she agree to see you?
You're right.
What should l do now?
Sacrifice.
Why should l do it and
for whom should l do it?
Do it for me.
Who are you?
They will tell you.
Where is the money?
What is he saying?
While discussing about wedding cards,
l told him we shouldn't talk
about credit cards.
Thanks.
No formalities between us.
Don't get too close.
Ourjourney has just begun.
l've a small doubt.
ls there anyone accompanying
you apart from me?
No. l go one by one.
That's all.
Only then, l can have
full concentration on him.
ls this enough?
lt was little more.
Now do you understand?
Understood in detail.
What did you understand?
l came here to become her husband.
You became my demon.
What a punch!
l was punched so badly.
When l heard about you,
l thought you will have goons
and girls around you.
But you look very simple.
Like in your films, do you want me
to kill someone all the time?
Painting is my life.
lt's great to be both painter & goon.
Tell me why you have come here.
Nothing, brother.
l couldn't sleep for the past 3 days.
Do you want me to massage your legs?
l don't have to explain you
how soft an artist will be.
A goon, a third class fellow,
came to my studio and
hurt me infront of my staff.
Notjust hurt, he beat you
to pulp, right?
Stop staring at me.
We shouldn't hide anything
from doctor & goon.
Tell him as it is.
Have you finished talking?
Shall l tell him the rest or will you tell him?
This is it.
This is what had happened.
What should l do for you?
You must show your power.
No obligation because
l'm the top music director.
Charge as per your market rate.
He should be beaten so badly that...
l will tell him.
You should beat him
the way he beat you.
How will l know the way he beat him?
l know.
l've never seen anyone
beating like that.
Like Sivamani beating Jazz.
Like Zakir Hussain with Tabla.
Like AR Rahman's music
in Shankar's film.
He beat him & then asks him to sing.
ln one word...
You said so many words.
ln short, he beat him like a dog.
l understood.
He beat him to pulp.
We should beat that guy to pulp, right?
Yes.
Who is he?
Bottu Seenu.

You look good. Like a top.
Are you trying to make us
go for each other's neck?
l had no such ideas.
My hip is paining for standing
like this for the past 3 hours.
Let me relax for sometime.
Don't move.
He might start afresh.
You feel bad more than him.
Just because l've a creative mind,
l'm drawing your face & leaving you.
lf you repeat this again...
Will you draw my portrait again?
l'll garland your photo.
lt's over.
Come down & see for yourself.
You will be happy.
Look there not me.
You look like a monkey.
The entire gold shop is on you.
Won't you pay the credit card bill?
l don't even pay the current bill.
How can l pay credit card bill?
lf you do anything, l will lodge
a complaint that you're threatening us.
Will you lodge a complaint
to the police?
Take all the gold.
Stop beating me.
Stop it.
Why are you beating him like this?
Stop it.
lf he hasn't paid the bill,
will you hit him?
Beating a fellow man is not right.
l will pay his bill if you want.
Return him gold.
You take the gold & go inside.
Shravani...you?
What brings you here, Shravani?
l was going to temple.
l saw you. l stopped.
Really?
Even l was going to temple.
l saw them quarelling.
So, l stopped.
l go to temple every Saturday.
Let's go.
What happened?
He is beating my fans.
Boss...
Why is he calling you boss?
ln Hyderabad, if someone needs help,
they address others as boss.
You be here.
Sir, stop beating him.
Who are you man?
- l'm a fellow man.
Then get lost.
Stop.
Your sister-in-law is watching us.
We can deal with him later.
Go.
Please stop.
You stop.
Leave him.
lf l see you again in this area,
l will break your bones.
You want me to pay the bill...?
Shravani...you?
Did you get hurt?
When someone beats us,
we do get hurt.
He came & saved us at the right time.
l did nothing.
She pressed the brakes
on seeing you suddenly.
Why were you quiet when he
was trying to beat you?
He will feel bad by tonight.
What did Gandhi say?
When someone slaps you on one cheek,
he told us to show the second cheek.
That's something we can't do.
Atleast if we don't slap the guy who
beat us, Gandhi will feel happy.
How dare you lay hands on Bottu Seenu!
Rs.10 lakhs. Total Rs.15 lakhs.
- Keep the money inside.
Okay.
Your men beat me all night.
My boys haven't completed
boxing practice.
l will leave you once their
practice session is over.
l beg you.
Stop it.
lt's me Shravani.
Hello Shravani, tell me.
l wanted to talk to you.
Really? Where should l come?
Why leave your office & come?
You be in your office.
l will come there.
Thanks. Bye.
You seem to be very happy.
Shravani is coming.
ls she coming here?
To office.
When did you have an office?
So, she is going to Sharat's office.
Hey girl,
Where is Sharat?
- Which Sharat?
The big guy like a buffalo.
ln that cabin.
Hey, what are you doing?
- You?
Give me your coat.
- For what?
l said give it.
Give it l say.
Did someone come here for me?
Why would someone
come here for you?
Didn't l tell you that l will use
you & your name at times?
Don't press as you like.
They might get deleted.
To hell with you.
l know everything.
Now, l am Sharat.
Who am l then?
Hi Sharat!
- Hi!
Sharat, he is...
Guess who?
Your PA.
What's yourjob here?
Tell her.
Do you have to tell her about my job?
l told you to order something
for her to drink.
You're very clever.
You change everything
to your convenience.
l told you that there is virus
in my laptop two days back.
Clients are coming.
Don't you have any sense that
l've to give them a presentation.
Sharat, why is he talking to your PA
instead of talking to you?
We don't talk to each other.
He is our mediator.
What's the problem?
Ego problem.
Whenever l come to talk, you take
leave to meet prospective brides.
What's this meeting?
Who are they?
Who are you say that?
Did you say that too?
l was wondering why you haven't
said that till now.
Come on, go ahead.
Ask me who l am?
Ask me why l'm sitting in this office?
Ask me who this girl is?
Who is this girl?
lf there are any problems between us,
we must solve them.
How could you insult her
by asking who she is?
ls asking an insult?
- Asking a celebrity who she is, is an insult?
ls she a celebrity?
What celebrity?
Shravani, a great singer.
l've never heard her name.
Shravani, don't feel bad.
He has no manners.
You can become the
CEO of this company.
But you can never become a singer.
l feel insulted to speak to
cultureless creatures like you.
What?
Why are you shouting?
You mannersless.
You don't get angry.
He is like that only.
Shit!
- Worst behaviour. Let's go.
Shit...?
You brought strangers to office and
made them abuse me, ah?
l'm in no way related to them.
Why did they come to your cabin
and sat in your chair?
Notjust in my chair,
but also in my life.
Why should we quarrel with him?
When he is so rude,
why were you so polite?
l am not interested in fights.
But how could you be
so soft & polite?
He will feel bad later.
The other day, when someone hit you,
you said that he will feel bad later.
But did he feel bad?
Forgive me, sir.
l couldn't sleep last night
after hitting you.
Now if you forgive me,
l will sleep peacefully.
lf you feel bad for you acts,
it is the greatest regret.
There is a change in you
atleast now.
That's enough for me.
Never hit anyone, Go.
Shravani, my family members
are your fans.
You must marry a good man like him.
Bye.
Unbelievable Sharat.
Your formula is really great.
l did nothing.
Gandhiji laid the foundation,
l followed his foot steps.
You mentioned aboutjourney earlier.
Can l know how far we have
travelled in thatjourney?
We are near the canopy.

l'm your king,
you're my queen...
Shall we unite and
rule over Andhra Pradesh?

l was waiting eagerly to be yours...
Have a ball with me...
My heart is on rocks today...
Nobody ever moved me
like this till now...
O girl, you're my beautiful
Cinderella...
By God's grace,
l'm on cloud nine...
You've created sensation
in my heart...
By God's grace,
l'm on cloud nine...
Up above the clouds
l'm touching the peak of love...
You're a star,
l'm near you...
Wiping out the distance between us,
l'm coming closer to you...
l'm getting lighter and
floating in sky...
As l share my love with you...
l'm happy for getting you...
May l save this unexpected
bliss forever with me?

Though l love you for long time...
l'm angry on my lips for
expressing it to you..
Though you're near,
though you've called me...
But l got an opportunity
to meet you now...
Though l'm in your thoughts
and your breath...
Without me your loneliness
is unbearable...
l've lost myself in dreams
losing my sleep...
May l give you as gift my bliss?
lt seems there was an exhibition
of MF Hussain's paintings.
And he got millions.
Let's also have an exhibition
of your paintings, boss.
We too can make millions.
- Shut up! Never sell art.
Even if you wish to sell
there are no takers.
Without colouring it,
why are you making noise?
Am l talking, Master?
My boys are doing it.
lf you don't concentrate you'll also
end up as fool like them.
Boys! Respect master!

l didn't like what you did.
You claimed it was your fans who
made you win the song competition.
You didn't say a word about me,
your brother.
lf l had, people would come to know
l'm your sister, isn't it brother?
How much foresight you've
regarding security?
l couldn't think about it.
lt's a surprize if you could,
what's so surprize if you couldn't.
My foot! Aunty...uncle...
- Yes son.
Are you taking good care of her?
We don't have children so we take
care of her as our own daughter.
That's okay, how far your
painting classes have come?
With master's guidance l'm now
into colouring from curvings.
Even young boys take just 2 weeks
to reach this stage,
your brother took 2 years.
My sister has come and
my creative work is disturbed.
So, please grant me leave
today from class.
Did you see the Hippocratic world?
They say l'm like God or their son
when they come for a settlement.
But nobody gave their daughter
in marriage to me.
They said l'm a goon's son.
Now l've crossed
the age of marriage.
Forget about me.
l sent to you to be with uncle to avoid
you also becoming like me.
Did you find any good man?
- Yes, brother.
Who is he?
l found a man l dreamed
about since my childhood.
Moreover he's my fan, name's Sharat,
he's a software engineer.
Why are you delaying it?
Bring him here and tie the knot.
Here? He'll die in shock.
ls he an heart patient?
- No, he's a coward.
l've kept our background
secret to him.
lf he comes to know,
he'll ditch me.- ls it?
How?
You don't worry, brother,
l've a plan for it.
How come you're getting ready so early?
Where are you going?
Shravani wants to introduce me
to her family. That's why!
Seenu sir, l'm Sharat.
- Who?
The identity you're using.
You?! Tell me.
What am l to tell?
- Then, hang up.
Don't cut it sir, l used your identity
as you used mine.
How's the result?
Sir, money.- Do you know who am l?
- No.
East side Marredpalli,
West side Kukatpalli,
North side Kompalli,
South side Upparapalli,
all round Hyderabad, is there anyone
who doesn't know 'Bottu' Seenu?
Are you Bottu Seenu?
Take anything you want sir.
l'll come back if l want.
l used his name.
l'm very happy,
use my name as you like.
l tried that too.
Money sir.
Do you know who am l?
- No.
East side Marredpalli,
West side Kukatpalli,
North side Kompalli,
South side Upparapalli,
all round Hyderabad, is there anyone
who doesn't know 'Bottu' Seenu?
Are you Bottu Seenu?
Bloody!
Leave my vest, who are you?
Abids area Cl!
How dare you threaten my brother-in-law
to settle credit card due? Come!
Along with favours you've to
face troubles too, enjoy it.
Well said, please do me a favour.
- What's it?
They want to come to the station
everyday to sign.- Do it.
They may arrest me again for forgery.
What do you want me to do then?
Tell Sl that you're real Bottu Seenu.
No need to spend a rupee also.
Line was clear till now.
l can't hear it now. What can l do?
How could he accept it directly?
lf he's here, someday she may know
you're not the real Sharat.
Then, let's bump him off.
Shut up! l'll tell her the truth
at an opportune time.
Okay brother.
What's this? lt's funny!
Why are we still revolving here only?
How do we go inside?
Sir, the way in is this side.
l know, you go away.
Who are you man?
Brother! ls it you?
Got deceived, right?
You look like a business man
to any stranger.
Even known people must
feel like that.
Otherwise, bones will crack up!
- Shut up! Useless!
lf you say anything l'll burn your mouth.
Shut up!
Or else our plan will fail.
- Do as she says.
But where is Sharat?
Hey King!
Who are you?
Why are you getting into the vehicle?
Reverse the jeep.
Why should l?
No questions, just follow the orders.
l'm on an important mission,
why are you troubling me?
Don't act smart, King!
King? Who is he?
- Get going.
Why so many guns and Sumos
like in faction films?
Leave me boys,
my girl is waiting for me.
Don't talk.
Brother...got him.
East side Marredpalli,
West side Kukatpalli,
North side Kompalli,
South side Upparapalli,
all around Hyderabad,
l've a name 'Bottu' Seenu.
Who is this King?
Kill him!
Why hasn't he come yet?
Did he pick up any fight on the way?
Fight? Sharat is scared of fights.
You know this? Sharat faints on
seeing blood.- Poor man!
lf you make a wrong call,
you waste only a call.
lf you disturb a wrong man,
wastage will be heavy like this.
Where did he go away?
Why hasn't he come yet?
Why did get so late?
My brother is waiting.- Brother?
l don't have anyone else
other than my brother.
He sent me to live with
my paternal uncle.
What does your brother do?
Come, l'll introduce you to him.
Brother!
Brother!
She gave me the shock of my life!
She made me believe she's pint size
Mother Teresa with her acting prowess,
but actually she's
king sized Phoolan Devi.
That's okay, but how did you
manage to come out?
l'll tell you.
- Brother!
Bottu Seenu, how dare you trap
my sister with fake identity!
Who are you talking to sir?
- Why are you turning back?
l'm talking to you.
- Me?
Yes, Bottu Seenu!
Brother! What's this?
His name is not Bottu Seenu.
l'll make him say he's not
Sharat but Bottu Seenu.- Brother!
Why are you calling Bottu Seenu
as Sharat who works for me?
What are you saying, brother?
He was referred by Secretariat
Gopal Rao, uncle's friend.
l selected him after many tests,
you spoiled entire the show
by brandishing a gun.
lf people know l'm your sister,
no educated man will ever marry me,
so l stayed with uncle,
and made up a story that l hate goons,
and trapped this innocent man.
you spoilt everything.
You acted as singer with
such a violent mob background.
Spill water and wake him up!
Hold it.- You said your brother
is into hardware business...?
What's that gun?
Who is this Bottu Seenu?
A dangerous goon.
He's a replica of you.
- Yes.
Why is he carrying gun then?
Brother is a big business man,
he's facing a threat from him, that's why.
Carries a gun for self defense.
l don't understand what's all
these guns and threats?
You don't worry,
l've an urgent meeting,
you carry on with lunch.
Come on boys.
Brother is no ordinary man.
- Always great!
Greetings sir.
- Greetings, where is Seenu?
That is...that is...
- What's it? Where is he?
He's sleeping.
- Yes brother.
ls he any Nawab to sleep till now?
Wake him up.
No brother... - Get up...
- Please listen, he'll beat on waking up.
Are you so weak?
Pull it with strength.
Who is that disturbing me
early morning?
Partner! How come you're here?
For your commission?
No, we came to confirm.
To confirm?
- You shut up.
Where were you at 10.30?
Abids police station.
- Police station?
l threatened Cl's brother-in-law
for credit card dues.
He locked me up all the night.
ls it? Get me Cl Ramesh on phone.
Brother! - Ramesh! Did you pick up anyone
by the name Bottu Seenu?
Notjust picked him up but
bashed him up all the night.
How dare you threaten my brother-in-law!
- Stop it.
When did you free him?
- l freed him at 10.45.
Are you sure?
- Sure.
You say he locked you up,
he says he bashed you also,
won't you tell him
that you're my man?
Will he be there after basing me?
He's boasting with you.
l'm confused who should l trust
and who l shouldn't.
Bye, let's go.
Bye Seenu.
Thank God!
- How can they look alike?
l'll tell you brother.
l saw an old Hindi film on TV recently,
there's a big Nawab's family in it,
they have twins after
years of marriage.
Twins?
- Twins!
Why did you say that in English?
Carry on.
They celebrate it grandly and children get
washed away when a cyclone hits them.
l got you, enough.
One washed away son grows up as
Bottu Seenu with Bottu Narasimha.
Another reaches a good family and
grows up as our Sharat Babu.
That's all, isn't it?
- Yes, boss.
Tell me brother.
- Give me Sharat's address.
l behaved rough with Sharat
mistaking him for Bottu Seenu.
l'll say sorry to him personally.
A guest at lunch time.
You?! No way, go away!
- Open it!
Didn't you find anyone else
here other than me?
l beg you sir, please leave me
and my identity.
As if you gave your identity for free,
are you not using my name?
l used it without knowing your reputation,
so police are playing with me.
Looks like we have visitors.
You've a family too?
They were here before
you came into my life.
How to manage them?
- You've a facility.
My grandma is blind and
my grandpa is deaf.
l like your family.
Your grandma is blind, your grandpa
is deaf and you're brainless.
You're very lucky.
Who are they?
- Friends.
My name is Sharat.
You too have same name
like my foolish grandson.
Why have you all come at a time?
Bride's brother is coming
to meet Sharat.- ls it?
So you'll come here everytime
they come for you.
Hey idiot!
- Granny, that side.
You don't say yes because
l'm blind and he's deaf.
You're an average looking guy.
They may refuse seeing
so many handicaps here.
Right granny.
So sit straight before me
when l talk to them.
Otherwise, my looks will not match.
l think they are here, come, let's go.
- What to do now?
You? What brings you here?
He's Sharat.
- Yes.
l feel bad for what had happened.
You got confused little.
So l came to meet your family
and say sorry to you.
Who is he?
Sharat?
- He too is Sharat, my friend.
Confusion with identical people
and identical names.
lntroduce me to your family.
- Come.
He's Gyaneshwar, Shravani's brother,
he came to say sorry for the incident.
Tell him to sit and say it,
it'll be clear.
Sharat, sit here.
l'm not saying because he's my grandson,
he's a thorough gentleman.
Devotee of Goddess.
- Yes, she's right.
Uncle!
Aunty!
l brought a marriage proposal
for Sharat, didn't l?
lt's cancelled,
it seems they abused our Sharat,
he told me unable to tell you.
Let it go, l'll get better ones.
Gopal Rao, you're short tempered,
bride's brother is here to say sorry.
Greetings Gopal Rao.
- Look before you say something.
What did l say now?
By the way, who is he?
ls he Sharat?
- He's also Sharat.
Voice is different, where is he now?
l must manage without
committing anything.
You got confused with
just identical names,
l got shock of life with identical faces,
that's why l got it wrong.
Sharat, l get an idea on seeing you.
lf you say yes, l'll find you
another good proposal.
What do you say?
ls it good on your part?
How can you talk about finding another
proposal when we are talking here?
Shouldn't we see another proposal?
- You shouldn't.
Why not?
Come out, l'll tell you why not?
- Where are you taking me?
Can you bring a better proposal?
- Why are you pushing me?
He's handsome and smart,
so l promised to get a better proposal.
What's wrong in it?
Do you think we are software
engineers in suits?
What will you do?
- He's going overboard.
Take him and give him
a good thrashing.
He mustn't be seen
till marriage is over.
What's happening here?
Why are you sitting there
instead of here?
Change your positions.
- He's coming.
l talked and convinced Gopal uncle,
he asked us to fix the marriage.
What do you say, grandpa?
- As you say.
Do you always say it short?
- Yes.
Sharat, just a minute please.
Bye granny.
- Bye son.
Why is your brother-in-law very close
with your friend than you?
Don't try to know everything at this age,
you may die in confusion.
That's right.
What's this?
Open it, you'll know.
Who painted this?
MF Hussain?
Ravi Varma?
Your brother-in-law.
- Who is he?
lt's me!
- You?!
Unbelievable.
See, he's an educated man,
so he knows the value of creation.
But that Bottu Seenu is
an uneducated goon.
You're talking a lot about Bottu Seenu,
who is that man?
He's not a man but manhole.
Bloody, cuts throats for money.
Obnoxious man!
Please don't ask about that Satan
at this happy hour.
l must tell this to my sister, bye.
- Bye, be careful!
See, both brother and sister
have played a trick on you,
and then dare to use
bad words also.
They started the drama
and l'll end it.
Both brother & sister must go mad
about identity confusion l'll create.
Bloody! How dare you lodge a
complaint with police against us.
Stake another 25 on Pakistan
also for safe side.
Do you want me to
settle the accounts?
Accounts?
Where will it go away?
Brother. Call his family, and ask them
to take him away. Go.
Give me Rs.50000.
You haven't settled old dues yet,
how can l lend you money everyday?
Won't you?
- l won't!
Why should l live then?
l'll kill myself.
l'll give whatever you ask.
- l'm living to repay your loan.
Take Rs.50000.
- l know you're generous, Das.
The day l find King,
l'll settle my entire loan.
l'm sending Rs.50000,
stake 500/0 on each one.
How long should we have to bear him?
Can't avoid till we get back our money?
What happened?
- We found King!
What a great news!
ls my nephew in this city?
Find him quickly!
Das, take it as your loan is settled.
Let's celebrate it.
Have a party on my account.
We must find him first.
Where will he go?
We'll surely find him.
What's it, brother?
You're so happy.
How can l else be other than happy!
l thought Bottu Seenu was fooling
me with two identities.
Both are different people.
They are as different
as sky and earth.
l selected him to match our family.
So, let's fix marriage before he comes to
know about us. What do you say?
As you wish!
- Aunty, sister is feeling shy.

Just a look is enough, O Adonis!
My pulse rate is racing...
Know it, O handsome!
The desire of my heart...
Just a look is enough, O Aphrodite!
l can't hold it anymore...
l know it, O beauty!
The desire in your heart...
Unite me into you forever...
Unite with me so that
we become as one...

What's the use of my youth
if it can't become yours?
Shall l write my name
with your lips?
lf clouds of love want
to shower on me...
How can l say no?
Shall l take this great beauty
into my arms?
l wish to spend my life
with you...

O beauty! l read your wishes...
Mischievous desires are gushing
and rushing towards you...
l've given myself to you...
Lost myself in you...
Take everything from me,
l've opened myself to you...
May l explore the
unexplored in you...
Madam's horoscope is
like Goddess Seetha.
Sir's horoscope is
like Lord Rama.
Then, let's conduct their
marriage immediately.
The real problem is the auspicious
time is just an hour away only.
An hour only?
ls marriage like going to
shop and buying sweets?
You asked suddenly and
l checked almanac immediately,
auspicious time is fixed suddenly.
How can l fix marriage in an hour?
Find another time.
Then, fix another groom not this one.
Have you gone mad? lf you say
anything l'll bash you up!
Please madam don't get angry,
the problem is that,
if you don't get engaged now,
many a confusion will come,
particularly to the groom and when
your sister delivers the first child,
it'll swallow the maternal uncle.
Am l any chocolate to swallow?
lt's bad omen to the uncle,
your life will be danger.
This man is aiming barrel at me!
Forget it, don't believe it.
l don't want to take chances,
shouldn't l be here to
take care of you?
What's the time now?
You've already lost 5 minutes
in the countdown.
Already lost 5 minutes,
make arrangements quickly.- Yes boss.
You call Sharat here.
- Will he accept it?
lf you tell him the details,
he'll eat away the remaining time.
You call him here
narrating some tale,
l'll take care of the rest.
Already 30 minutes over,
has that doubting Thomas left his office?
Why are you standing here
like a wall? Get lost!
Brother, Sharat is here.
What's all this?
He has started it,
give me your hand,
vow on Goddess, don't open your
mouth for next 30 minutes.
You've made a vow on Goddess.
Shut up!
Be silent, l'll tell you.
Priest saw your's and
my sister's horoscope,
he said if you both don't
get married in an hour,
you both will end in forest like
Lord Rama and Goddess Seetha.
Who is Satan here?
That Bottu Seenu.
l'm arranging this to keep that
bloody idiot out of our lives.
You're worried about
your family, right?
This is just for a formality,
let's invite all when we do it again.
You've sworn on Goddess, you can't speak,
priest, groom is here.
Stop...
Come...come...
l've made him swear on Goddess
to keep silence,
let's do it quickly.
Shut up!
Bride and groom say do
after finish the hymns.
Say do, not no.
ls the groom deaf?
What would a deaf man do?
Saying yes in heart will do.
Then do it like that.
- As you say.
Say yes in your heart.
You can exchange rings now.
Give me.
Wear it. Give me your hand.
Put the ring.
- lt's over.
Put this ring to her.
Do it, auspicious time is elapsing.

lf he opens the mouth,
he'll kill me with his doubts.
You both go out and enjoy.
lsn't she a Telugu girl?
Hindi girl who acts in Telugu films,
forget about girls and watch the film.
He thinks we are software
company owners in suits.
No use in giving us
just a marriage feast,
you must present us
with silk saris also.
You're ready to take
silk saris as gift,
but never bothered to find
a girl for me in 10 years.
What did l do?
- That Nizamabad girl was ravishing,
you said l'm a goon and marrying me
is like death and she refused me.
They wanted an intelligent boy,
you had brawn but no brains.
lf l had no brain,
would l've trapped Sharat easily?
Why did he come again?
Have you forgotten
anything to come back?
Coming again?
l'm coming now only.
Coming now? Where's Baby?
Baby?
- My baby.
l'm coming now after getting
a call from your Baby.
Who came earlier then?
- lt was Bottu Seenu.
His look alike, he was trying
to say something,
you played a trick and
made him shut up.
Sir, if you pay my fee,
l'll take leave.
l beg you, you come here,
you wait here.- Okay.
l made a grave mistake.
You must get her married to the
man she's engaged now.
l'll strangle your neck.
He's just a henchman, should l get
my sister married to him?
l beg you, find a way out.
- There's a way out in the almanac.
What is it?
When the bride is not available,
her brother can do it,
that means you can do it.
What are you doing here then?
We both must get engaged quickly.
l'm not like that.
- Am l like that then?
According my family tradition,
l must get engaged
to my brother-in-law.
lf we don't do it in next 3 minutes,
priest says you both will go to forest
like Lord Rama and Goddess Seetha.
Tell him l say.
- Yes...yes.
Where is Shravani?
- Went to watch a film.
At this hour?
lt's a tradition that bride must watch a film
while engagement is going on.
You carry on.
- You sing a song.
Leave me, what's this injustice?
lt's over...over...
- What's this?
What's this nasty?
A man putting a ring to another man?
This is our tradition, you put.
Okay, l'll.
- Put it.
Excellent!
Already 20 seconds past,
if l tell him l'll die.
lf l don't he'll die.
That's better!
l'm confused what's all this
nasty traditions and dancing?
lt has just started,
you'll know it, don't worry.
Brother, Bottu Seenu is very cunning.
l'm worried about Baby.
- Yes.
Keep aside your doubts & go home,
we've to meet a person.
Who?
- Satan!
Where did you go till now?
- l went out on an urgent work.
Sister mustn't know this.
Who are you man?
You? What are you doing here?
- Come out!
Come out...come out...
l'll come back in a minute.
- Where are you going again?
Come here.
Shouldn't you ask
what was happening there?
Shouldn't you reveal your identity?
Wanted to use the situation
and trap my sister?
You never gave any chance to speak.
You didn't brother.
l accept it was my mistake,
l got her engaged to you
instead of Sharat.
Engaged to me instead of him?
Are you drunk?
l don't drink in day time. lsn't it?
- Yes.
Sharat is your photocopy,
you know that?
With the exchange of rings,
our hearts too got exchanged,
l'm in love with your sister now,
can't change my heart as easily
as changing the ring?
l'll tell your sister that l'm Bottu Seenu,
problem will be over.
Don't do it, my sister is hard on surface
but very delicate on sensitive issues.
Her heart will break if she comes
to know she's engaged to a goon.
l'll find a better bride for you
if you're interested.
You couldn't find one for yourself,
how can you find for me?
You promised 100/0 in Khairtabad,
l don't want that also.
Brother, what's this?
- You...
What do you say?
l'll say only one thing,
engagement in Bottu family
is like half marriage over,
so l'll not leave your sister at any cost.
lf any Sharat comes to stop me,
l'll break his limbs,
make a biryani of it and
send it to your home.
Tell your sister to accept
Bottu Senu as her husband.
Brother!
What brings you here?
He's here because...
- l'll tell her.
One of our aunt said newly engaged couple
mustn't go out, so l came for you.
What's this you've become
so superstitious?
We'll go out to shop and
come, you carry on.
No dear.
Calling you.
- Me?
lf Sharat comes to know this,
he may jump.
We must make an intelligent move.
No need of intelligence, boss.
Let's do it ordinarily.
You're straining yourself,
are you composing any tune, sir?
l'm planning.
- What?
Planning to kill Bottu Seenu
and Gyaneshwar.
Looks like you're not satisfied
with what had happened,
no need to extend it.
You don't know what is revenge.
Why not? We saw it here recently.
- Shut up!
My brain is filled with revenge,
l'm not able to create anything.
Why strain newly to create?
Let's buy CD's as usual.
l can understand your pain sir,
l know the pain of revenge as
a native of Rayalaseema,
l know few factionists
who are in the city now,
they will do it for you.
l don't want to waste your time
with my revenge story,
what's your price to kill a man?
Price depends on the person.
He's the person.
Tell them it's my order.
ls it any exhibition?
What do you want?
We want him.
ls it Bottu Seenu or Sharat?
Who is he?
King!
King?
Where did he come from?
He came from Coimbatore.
Rajachandra Pratap Varma.
We came in search of him.
Brother.
- What?
Come aside for minute.
- Why are you taking me aside?
Brother, in Nawab's family the mother
gave birth to triplets not twins.
This is the third...
- l got it, keep quiet.
Sharat, Seenu and King.
These fellows don't know there
are others here just like King.
Before they see Sharat,
if we handover Seenu to them,
my brother-in-law will be safe
and Seenu will die. Come on boys.
Okay, if l give him to you,
yourjob is done,
how would it benefit me?
He says Rs.1 lakh,
agree for Rs.2 lakhs, boss.
l'll pay Rs.100 lakhs.
Money isn't important,
you've come to me for the first time,
Yourjob will be done in 2 days.
Call me afterjob is done.
Bye. Come on boys.
Are they beasts?
No civic sense at all.
lf you promise to take it easy,
l'll tell you a shattering truth.
Tell me brother.
By mistake l got you engaged to Bottu Seenu
who is a look alike of Sharat.
Brother?!
- Yes dear.
What actually had happened was...
Should l've to marry Bottu Seenu now?
Would l allow your life to ruin, dear?
lt's not a serious thing also,
it happened by mistake, priest says
it's not counted by almanac rules.
What should we do with Seenu?
- l've a plan for him.
You be alert, don't get drunk.
Sister.
- Brother.
You act like moving close with him.
We'll take care of the rest.
Brother-in-law is coming.
Come Seenu.
Why did you call me?
l and my sister have
come to a decision.
What are you looking at?
Tell him.
For good or bad,
l got engaged to you,
it's right to marry you.
- What about Sharat?
l don't care about anyone
once my sister decides.
lt's our tradition to throw a feast for
brother-in-law after engagement.
What are you waiting for? Get it.
- Get it fast.
Get it.
How neatly you've packed it!
- What is this?
Drink it, you'll know it.
- You want me to?
lt's nectar.
Drink it l say.
That's it!
lt's a feast thrown by
my brother-in-law...
l came running...
He gave me something to drink...
l had few gulps...
Just for few pegs l'm going crazy...
Just for few drops, stars from the
sky came down to earth...

Charminar and Shah Alibanda
are rocking...
Golconda has turned topsy turvy...
l wanted to enjoy but
my brain has gone bonkers...
What have you done to me?
You've made me crazy,
Yadagiri Narasimha...
l'm rocking to the local beat...

l saw you in Koti and
broughtjasmine flowers...
l saw you in Bhongir,
l was attracted by your manliness...
Your ear studs shone
in Ram nagar centre...
l'll shower you with kisses
in Nimboliadda...
Your sexy sultry body is
driving me crazy...

l'll become all yours happily...
l'll unite with you and have you...
lt's festival time in Medaram,
will you take me in a bullock cart...
Let's go to Mumbai in a flight,
will you come?
My brother fixed this marriage
floored by your valour...
He did a good job!
Look, they have brought him.
Das, your Rs.500 millions
are rolling in.
What's it you shorty?
Put him down.
- Open it.- Stop it.
l gave you information,
l've an obligation.
You want to open it.
No, l must take revenge
before he comes out.
How dare you beat me!
Who do you think l'm!
l'll stamp you out!
Enough! Why are you beating
a man in sack?
What are you watching?
Open it.
l would've died!
How come you're here?
l told you to get him drunk and finish,
but you got drunk and tried to finish me?
Who kicked me?
- That music director!
This short man?
- Yes brother.
You bloody rascal!
Please leave me brother!
- Nobody ever dared to touch me.
How dare you beat me!
- What's this drama? Where is King?
Shut up! He's smart,
he escaped from us.
l'll personally get him,
come on boys.
You'll go out from here
only after he comes.
How dare you threaten me!
Have you drawn all your guns?
Are you crazy?
Would he come if you kill me?
Think over it using brain.
What are you saying?
l can't repeat it dear.
l don't know how you do it,
bring him here.
Brother is in danger
for your lousy job.
When Bottu Seenu comes here,
l'll engage him with my talk,
one shot with this at an
opportune moment. That's it!
No blood or no death!
- Okay madam.
But the bloody idiot mustn't
get up for two hours.
We don't know that technic, we'll beat him,
we don't mind if he lives or dies.
What else do you know then? Bloody!
He's coming, you all hide.
Run, huge like buffaloes.
Come fast...come fast.
Get him out, come.
- He's here!
You've come at the right time.
Brother, how dare they keep
you as hostage.
Let's settle it.
Settle? Are they humans to settle?
Beasts, l'll settle things with them.
You clam down.
Hey beard!
Here's your King,
do whatsoever you want to,
but l'm warning you, be careful,
he's very cunning and smart.
Give him to them.
With this ends trouble from Seenu.
- Yes brother.
Go, get the payment,
l want highest denomination only.
Miss Shravani! Who are you guys?
Please leave me. What's this?
Miss Shravani?
Sir...where is the temple?
Where is the God?
Come!
Brother, l think he's Sharat.
Tell them to leave me,
l've to go to my office.
He says office,
it means he's Sharat.
What to do now?
Hey you stop!
- Miss Shravani!
Come without shouting.
- Stay here!
Aren't you satisfied with
what you gotjust now?
Who are you guys?

Come King!
l beat your men for
calling me like that.
lf you call me King again,
l'll thrash you also.
l know you're not King.
lf l place you in King's place
since you're his look alike.
All my problems will be solved.
So, you must impersonate
as King for few days.
Why should l?
l'll pay you Rs.100 millions.
l must like the job also
along with remuneration.
l'll support only if you're
on the justice side.
l'm on the justice side, l'm living
a dog's life amongst these wolves.
My nephew's money for good cause
has become noose to me now.
l can understand your dilemma,
what will happen to me
if King returns?
King's no more, he won't come.
Why will he not come?
- He's dead!
You promised to settle the loan after
finding King but now say he's dead.
Leave me.
Will you spare me alive
if l say King is dead?
That's why l didn't tell you.
l got an opportunity with Seenu
to settle your loans.
That's why l'm telling you the truth.
What's the guarantee that
you're telling the truth?
He saw King die. Tell him.
l kept his death a secret
to keep his family safe.
lf you help us,
l'll catch King's killers also.
l liked your point as well
as your payment.
Why did you come to the temple?
l told you l visit the temple
every Saturday.
As usual l came and some
bloody fool hit me from behind.
When l opened my eyes,
l'm here.
You're saying all that we know,
tell us what happened inside?
lt seems some King who
is my look alike,
they promise to pay Rs.100 millions
to impersonate him.
l got scared.
You don't get scared, Sharat.
Let's tell them he's Sharat not Seenu
and take him with us.
Why are you also talking mad
like him? Use your brain.
They don't want Seenu or Sharat,
they want someone who looks like King.
What to do now?
You act like King, l'll get Seenu
at right time to save you.
Then l'll go to office
and apply for leave.
Stop! Have we come to watch a film?
They will not allows us to go.
Why not? What have we done?
Explain to him.
- Actually, the problem is...
Elderly man! Seenu is cunning man,
he'll cheat you & escape.
Why would he escape?
He loves my sister.
She's her weakness.
We'll take her also.
She too has a weakness.
- For her too? What is it?
My sister loves me very much.
She'll not go anywhere without me.
l'm worried about how to
fit him in Kings' place,
l'll give invitations and you can
come with an entourage.
You don't worry,
l've a great idea.

Just by offering obsequies
to your dead father,
your father's soul will not rest in peace
who died in humiliation, Pooja.
There's another thing that you've to
do to make him rest in peace.
Only you can do it.
Deposit this Rs.20 lakhs cheque today.
- Yes madam.
Sister, we've searched
all the states for King,
only three states remain
to be searched,
Haryana, Gujarat and
one more state with Ch...
Chattisgarh.
- Correct Chari.
l think giving newspaper ads
there will help us.
But it'll cost you Rs.2 lakhs.
Okay, do it.
- Thank God!
Chari, pay in cash to Kona.
- Okay madam.
l think God will be more helpful
than spending on media, sister,
so l've decided to offer free food
in all the temples of the state.
Sorry sister.
- Okay, do it.
lt'll cost Rs.10 lakhs for doing it.
Anybody would've second thoughts
for such big amount.
l'll not have it.
Because my King is priceless diamond.
Well said sister,
our King will come back definitely.
Appaji has come back!
- Father!
How dare of you to come back here!
Why are you silent?
How could you come after betraying sister?
Are you worried about missing King
or me coming back?
Don't trap us with your words,
we don't care if you live or die.
We are worried about missing King.
Don't cry, l can feel your pain.
Nephew!
- What happened to you son?
What is this? Talk to me.
Sorry madam, he can't recognise anyone,
can't speak also.
What happened to my son?
Appaji would've done something.
Don't accuse him,
King met with an accident in Uttaranchal.
l'm Dr. Gyaneshwar Kale,
she's my sister Dr. Shravani Kale.
Greetings.
We were searching for herbs in the
forest when we heard human cries,
when we went to see,
we found your son on the verge of death,
we saved him with herbs and
were looking after him like an infant,
suddenly this man recognised him
as nephew and brought us here.
l was worried about missing nephew,
another worry was living away from you all,
l was searching in forest without
food or water, there l found him.
You don't look like a man fasting
but a gargantuan.
My body is like that.
Will my son become normal, doctor?
He'll definitely,
but he needs Art treatment.
Art treatment? What's that?
Yes, using tablets is English medicine,
Ayurveda is treating with natural herbs,
Art treatment is treating with arts.
You saved my son,
stay here till he's normal.
As you say madam.
We'll not go from here,
till your son moves.
Brother. Arrange for their stay.
- Okay, sister.
Come sir...come.
- Give way.
Trying to over ride me with your
Gudivada and Kakinada brains?
l'll rip out your skin.
Thanks Appaji, you saved Rs.12 lakhs
by bringing back King.
What you've seen now is nothing,
the real story begins from tomorrow.

Music has become my pulse
and beating as you in me...
Love is flowing out of me as music...
Kiss of love is seeding life into you...
Good times are upbeat
with great expectations...
Heart is blooming with divine music...
Music is blessing of God
creating sensation in heart...

Tell me who is that?
Mother!
Eldest uncle!
My sweet darling!
Who is this?
Gudivada uncle!
Kakinada uncle!

l'll make them believe Seenu is the King
and settle your loans. Okay?
This is your last chance.
You'll say like that only. Bye.
Appaji, l can't play this
drama anymore.
l feel l may become invalid
sitting in that wheel chair
l can't bear Gyaneshwar's horrible paintings,
and his sister's terrible songs.
No way, l'm leaving.
Don't do it, l'll see that you're
normal by tomorrow.
The last dose of Art treatment
begins today.
Do as l say closing your eyes to ward off
evil and any hitch in the treatment.
Hail Lord Ganesha!
Open your eyes now.
Who are you?
l'm Jayasurya,
creative music director,
l'm the chief of this art treatment.
Am l not?
Yes madam, he's my Guru.
- Greetings.
What have l taught you and
what you're doing here?
Will you come to the climax
without following any order?
We did follow order.
Which order did you follow? Tell me.
Kalyani raga must bring back legs,
Keeravani raga must bring back joints.
Which raga will cure diabetes?
ls it so powerful?
You're forgetting an important thing
with your half knowledge.
What is it, Guru?
- Sense of touch.
The last raga must be tried only when
patient has lost sense of touch.
lf there's any trace of it, the treatment
may leave him invalid for life.
l don't have any sense of touch.
- l must test and decide it.
Where is going?
You go back little.
Feel it?
You go back.
- Okay.
Feel it?
- No.
No?
Feel it?
- No feeling at all!
l feel he's taking revenge
instead of treating him.
You're crying! That means
you can feel the touch.
Not crying Guru but tears ofjoy for
your attention and love for me.
He says no feeling at all,
let's start the last treatment.
What's the time now?
lnauspicious time!
lf you do good things at bad time,
patient will get well but
doctor will become a patient.
Have you forgotten it?
We forgot it in tension.
Art treatment will not work in tension.
Let's start tomorrow at auspicious time.
You must understand an artiste's anger.
l'll make you understand it.
l'm dead! Bloody bas...
He beat me black and blue, mother f....
l must kick that son of a b...
He bashed me up.
Only l know it's pain. Bloody f...
Stupid idiot!
Why are you talking like Bottu Seenu?
What can l do?
l don't know any bad words,
l heard it someone using
these bad words. l copied it.
You brother and sister watched the fun,
never tried to stop him also.
Look, how black it has turned.
l can understand your pain,
l'll tell my brother to cut that
short man to his size.
Just few slaps up and down and
he'll go to the dogs, bloody idiot!
Bloody street mongrel!
Why are you speaking in local lingo?
Cursing makes me lose
control over language.
That's better. carry on.
l did re-recording for many
revenge films in my career,
the kick or punch we get after taking
revenge is something out of the world.
You got the revenge, let's go.
How can l? Still Gyaneshwar is there
who made me stand in hot sun to paint.
Then...
- Then?
That singer.
- Guru!
Despite my busy schedule,
l'm here for Shravani.
What?
- There!
Oh Gyani! As fellow artiste
l'm giving you a chance.
lf you give your sister to me
and fall on my feet,
l'll leave this place,
think it over, the choice is yours.

How dare you think of my sister!
l beg you sir, please leave me.
Fold your hands, l'll spare your life.
- Okay sir.
Do it Guru.
Fold your hands, l'll spare your life.
- My hands are not moving.
He beat his legs,
why are you breaking his hands?
You keep quiet, don't fuel to fire.
He took revenge, right?
Why are you shouting?
Brother, break his legs.
Look how he has come.
You broke it simple like sugar cane,
what's the technic?
This is known as leg lock,
must use it very carefully,
or else he may become
impotent for life.
Brother-in-law, l'll try on this leg.
- Try it, it's all yours.
Thanks brother-in-law.
He says he's new, please you do it.
Can anyone become a doctor
without killing few patients?
He's very enthusiastic,
let him do it.
You do it...
- Take rest now.
Good landing.
- Guru, are you still there?
l'm still there.
Great! You used the technic
perfectly the first time.
Why are you leaving me
in this condition?
Would l be in this condition all my life?
You'll be fine when you get the
shock of the life, till then enjoy it.
What's my position now?
You went for her and become an invalid.
- You stop it.
Like a snake charmer dies
from snake bite,
Art doctor has become
a patient of art treatment,
After two pegs doctor tried the last
treatment on King and it backfired.
lt left him in this state.
Who is worried about him?
First see that King walks.
Auspicious time is also elapsing,
start the final treatment song.
Don't help him,
let him do it himself.
Son!
- Be careful!
Mother, l can walk.
Brother! What's this magic of losing legs and
getting it back like in mythological films?
l can't understand his looks.
Mother...
Brother...
Why has he come all of a sudden?
What should l do now?
- Who is he?
Your brother.
- My brother?
King's brother.
You have to handle the situation carefully.
- Keep watching.
Mother.
Why have you come here
all of a sudden?
l wanted to see you all.
So, l've come.
Where is my brother?
Chinna...
- Brother...
How are you?
- You must be very fine.
Yes master.
Go up.
- What?
Who are they?
After you went to London,
your brother met with an accident.
They brought him home safe.
- Accident?
Why didn't you inform me?
- l'm very fine now.
Why have you landed here
all of a sudden?
l wanted to give you all a surprise.
Pooja, she is my mother.
- Greetings.
My brother.
- Greetings.
Greetings.
Who is she?
l know her even before
going to London.
Mother, if you agree,
she will be your daughter-in-law.
You knew that we won't go
against your wish.
That's why you brought her home.
Lakshmi...
- Yes
Give her the traditional welcome.

Come in.
We have no use of this dummy
who's acting like King.
We've to kill King's brother
soon and move out.
What can l do?
He's not able to move from here.
Find someone else.
Hang the phone.
Sai Kishore...
- Yes.
Call Gopi Mohan.
Stop ordering me like this.
Do l look like an auto driver to you?
What do you have to do with him?
l've got an idea to finish
Gyaneshwar & his gang.
Even though he broke your limbs,
you haven't reformed.
So what? l have my mouth
to take revenge.
Do you want to lose that too?
You'll see whether l will lose my mouth
or will make you run away from here?
You said you made King vanish.
How did he come back?
l don't understand.
l'll explain that to you.
Hey Appaji!
Have you replaced the King
with a fake man?
He has planned to usurp
all his wealth
l didn't tell you to memorise it.
Let's go & teach him a lesson.
Hey Bottu Seenu,
with the help of Appaji,
you became the King and fooled us.
Are you drunk?
l'm the King.
lf you were the King,
an unforgettable incident occurred between
you & me when you were 10.
Tell me what it is.
On your thread ceremony,
your father gave you a gift.
Tell me what was that.
Hey you guys, he is not King.
Call the police and
they will put them all in jail.
Why are you staring at us?
When l was 10 years old,
you fell on my feet pleading me
not to expose your theft.
l still remember.
You asked me what was the gift
my father gave me on thread ceremony.
This knife.
- Slowly master.
Do you know why he gave me this?
To hunt down beasts like you.
Why did you kill me? Tell me.
Why did you kill me?
Gopi Mohan, you said you did
something. Tell him.
l'm not a murderer.
l said so to have control over him.
You're looking very dull.
Didn't you sleep last night?
l felt like someone sitting
on my chest.
And since morning,
l have an headache.
lt happens in old buildings like this.
You will get used to it.
Don't worry.
Please come & have breakfast.
No. We will eat later.
- l said come.
Today is the end of King's brother.
Have your breakfast, uncle.
lt's alright if l don't eat.
Das is sitting outside the gate.
lf l don't give him money, he'll kill me.
lf you could get me Rs.1 crore
from your mother,
l'll throw that on his face and
keep his mouth shut.
Good morning brother.
- Good morning. Sit.
Go inside & get me money.
Slowly...
Drink the juice.
- Why are you refusing?
Son...
Leave her.
- Brother, what are you doing?
Why did you come here?
- Tell me. Tell me.
Leave her.
- Hey, what are you doing?
Tell me.
- Son...
What happened? Brother...
- What happened?
What happened, mother?
Sometimes, the medicines
take control of his body.
This is just a result of that.
- Doctor, what's wrong with my son?
You don't have to worry.
Let him take rest and
everything will be fine.
Take him with you.
Come my son.
Gyaneshwar, he pushed me down,
lifted such a big table,
tried to crush her neck.
Has he gone mad?
lt wasn't him who did this.
- Did you do this?
l'll show you who does this tonight.
l know about you, Gyani.
You can't sleep without drinks.
So, you're spinning some ghost story
and keeping us for your company.
l too feel the same.
You will understand.
Show me. You said something.
What's in there?
Don't make any noise.
Just see there.
Listen to what l say.
The one you are seeing now
is not Bottu Seenu.
lt's the King who has possessed him.
There is no more King.
He is dead.
To take revenge on those
who killed him,
the King's spirit which roams
round this palace
has possessed Bottu Seenu
who's his look alike.
ln the afternoon, when you were
busy eating on the dining table,
l was concentrating on Seenu.
When Swapna came,
l noticed a change in Seenu's behaviour.
What did you see?
- l saw his eyes turning red.
Why is King angry with the girl
who is going to marry his brother?
May be he is against inter caste marriage.
There could be other reasons also.
l made them believe that those were
the side effects of the treatment.
After referring to the books written
by Sigmund Freud on ghosts,
l got a clarity.
What you say is like the story
of the film Chandramukhi.
Even movies are made based
on real life stories.
Look, Bottu Seenu has fully
turned into King.
But Seenu is not aware that he is
being possessed by the spirit of King.
Should he have to come on
him only, that too now?
l've a treatment for this problem.
An amulet with blessings of Lord Hanuman
after years of penance.
As long as this is with him,
no evil spirits can touch him.
He must have this on him all the time.
According to his horoscope,
once he gets over his bad time,
his marriage is on the cards.
So, performing his marriage
soon is good for him.
Just tie the amulet & leave.
Why talk unnecessary things?
Where will he find a suitable
girl all of a sudden?
A suitable girl for him
is in this house.
Who is she?
- Shravani.
What do you say, doctor?
l've nothing to say.
lt's up to her.
What do you say?
l'm very happy.
Brother...
- Yes.
Find the auspicious day for
the engagement.- Okay.
lt is an auspicious function taking
place in this palace after a long time.
So, invite everyone to the function.

You're ready...l'm ready...
and the music band is also ready...
Date is fixed... place is ready...
let's marry happily...
Crazy dreams in eyes are ready...
Desires in heart are ready...
My love, flowers are also ready...
Henna designs on hand are ready...
Sparkling cheeks are ready...
O moon! Place is ready
for you in my heart...

You seem to be so near...
but you are far...
Don't run away from me
and tease me...
You come after me...
Asking me how long will you be away?
Look around, the distance between us
for few more days only...
You weren't like this till yesterday...
Don't become indifferent suddenly...
Tie the knot and
l'm all yours...
Son-in-law, why are you rushing?
Don't fall prey to
pangs of separation...
When so many are around,
you can't romance in public...

When l see you draped in sari...
l'll ward off evil eye cast on you...
l'll desire and wish for you and
take you into my arms...
Tie the knot with me
and l'll shed my pride...
l'll give up myself to you
and enjoy life...
lf you say like that
l'll make every day a bliss...
l'm waiting...
l'll become a part of you...
We'll celebrate the event and
get you married in near future...
Play the marriage band,
ravel in festivities...
The impersonator is becoming
a hurdle for everything.
l'll take care of the impersonator.
King's brother must die tonight.
Baba, we can't trust girls fully.
Hey...who are you guys?
He fight too well.
Wow Sharat! You're beating them to pulp.
Sharat is not so brave.
Then, you are...- Bottu Seenu.
Bottu Seenu...?
What happened to my Sharat?
He left once l came here.
Planning to fool me & get
your sister married to him.
lf you don't get your sister married
to me on the same day,
Sharat who escaped will die.
Shravani...get up.
- What's it brother?
Why did you disturb my good sleep?
You can sleep later.
But your life is about to get disturbed.
What happened?
Since Bottu Seenu has entered this house,
Sharat has left this place.
What now?
We have nothing to do with this guy.
All we need is Sharat.
Wait for the right time & let us
also escape. Pack our bags.
Okay brother.
My life is in danger but you're busy
in your marriage arrangements.
lf you don't get me money somehow,
Das will kill me.
What are you staring at?
There is an amulet tied to your hand.
Oh God!

Why did you come here?
Why did you come again?
Why do you want to kill my brother?
Who are you?
Tell me. Who are you?
Leave me.
- Tell me.
Leave her.
Have you gone mad?
Brother, she is here to
ruin our family.
l know that you're Bottu Seenu.
- No. l am king.
King died long back.
l got him killed.- Why?
To get rid of him.
People call me as King's brother.
The world doesn't know my name also.
Even if l win, the credit goes
to the King.
King is everything.
So, l wanted to be the king.
So, l got him killed.
Now you've come here as King and
acting as king to mint money.
Tell me how much you want.
l will give you.
Just leave this place right now.
Who are you guys?
Before knowing who we are,
you need to know a lot of things.
Many tried to kill King.
None could succeed.
But you killed him.
You killed the faith king had in you.
You killed his affection for you.
But you couldn't kill the King.
Killing King is notjust tough
but impossible.
Don't you understand.
Knowing that his only brother whom he
loved so much had tried to kill him,
and one who is in
unbearable pain is King.
Rajachandra Pratap Verma.
l know him very well.
He is Bottu Seenu & not King.
There can be men of same characteristics.
But a man like him is just one.
King's body guard Munna's real name
is Bottu Seenu. He is my son.
After knowing that a plot has been
planned in his house to kill him,
he made you all believe
that he is dead,
and came back here as Bottu Seenu
to find out the killer.
When he knew that it was you,
he is really dead.
Boss, Pooja is none other than the daughter
of our ex-employee Ranga Rao.
Bhagat Sait who couldn't destroy
your family directly,
used Pooja's revenge to
demolish this family.
So, Pooja trapped your
younger brother.
Why should l marry you?
You depend on your brother
for everything.
What if there is no King at all?
Pooja, if King hadn't come here on time,
you would've killed his younger brother.
He would've killed you too.
Tell her.
Yes, Bhagat Sait told me
to kill you too.
Pooja, to protect my family's honour,
l couldn't say anything on that
day regarding your father.
By the time l came to your house
to seek his forgiveness,
he had committed suicide.
l handed over the responsibility
to your aunt to bring you up
and made all the
necessary arrangements.
But l never let you know that.
Because l knew that
what l did wasn't a favour.
For the injustice done to you,
you've the right to kill me even now.
But Ajay is no way related
in this matter.
Father made me King and
what he gave me wasn't power.
lt was responsibility.
l wanted to give you all that l missed
in my life because of responsibility.
l treated your education as mine.
l treated your victory as mine.
l was never your brother.
l was like your father.
l thought that l was giving
all that you needed.
But l failed to know your wishes.
Ever since astrologer predicted
danger for me,
mother never had a peaceful sleep.
lf she comes to know that
you are my danger,
she wouldn't bear that truth.
Brother...
Sorry brother.
What you did wasn't a small
mistake to be pardoned.
Father, l've completed all
my commitments.
But l couldn't keep all of them happy.
l've only one choice to make
them all happy.
l must go far away from here.
Your mother has left this house.
Uncle...?
She told you not to look out for her.
Here is the wealth, fame & everything.
From now on, you're the King
of this palace.
She also wanted to convey
something to you all.
She was strict towards you all not
because of any revenge.
But to protect you from
falling into difficulties.
To look after her sisters-in-law properly,
she has equally shared the wealth to you all.
Surprised?
l forget everything even if
a small glass breaks.
Are you surprised how l could
remember all these things?
We can forget if glass breaks.
lf heart breaks, we cannot forget.
Date: September 18, 2008
Location: Temple
l wonder where & how my Sharat is.
Make sure he comes back to us soon.
Prayers are answered immediately here.
Sharat...
- Brother-in-law...you?
Where did you go without
even informing us?
Bottu Seenu threatened me.
l got scared & went to
my grandma's place.
Your cowardice saved your life.
What coward? l won't spare him.
l'll file a complaint with police.
What complaint can you lodge
on someone who is gone?
Gone where?
- To hell.
Look, that's Bottu Seenu's father.
He'll not be able to bear the
news of his son's death.
Be kind hearted & whenever you've time,
meet him & act like Seenu.
l cannot.
- Why?
What can l say?
l saw King's mother in the train.
l thought like you and
acted like her son.
Now you want me to act like Seenu.
How many characters can a man do?
l'm not a movie star.
Nothing wrong in doing any number of
characters for a good thing to happen.
Then, l will ask Shravani.
Where is she?
Sharat, you went missing suddenly.
l really got tensed.
Shravani, l want to tell you a truth.
l'm not Sharat.
Then?
- King.
Kittu, do you know why l'm leaving you?
l must know every plan of Bhagat Sait.
Swapna's name, all other details are fake.
How did you appoint her in
our company so foolishly?
On seeing your recommendation letter.
l had signed these blank letter
heads & kept it in a safe.
Which means that there is
someone in my house...
The one who attacked you
is Bhagat Sait's man.
But l couldn't find out the details
of the girl who shot you.
Your day to day program details
are on Bhagat Sait's table.
Even your Uttaranchal Trip.
l doubt that someone in your house
is trying to help Bhagat Sait.
Munna, listen carefully.
l started this drama with
the help of Munna.
Get inside fast.
Police are after you.
l found out that my eldest uncle is
not connected with this plot.
l entered into this palace
with his help.
l also found out that other 2 uncles too
are also not connected to this plot.

To give my brother his
most desired post,
l made everyone believe that l am dead,
and later came here.
What's it Kittu?
What is the matter?
Bhagat Sait gave me money to plant
a bomb in your brother's car.
What did you do?
- l planted it in his car.
Kittu, is the job done?
Bhagat Sait, l warned you before
that if you think about my family members,
l will be forced to think about you.
Who are you?
- King
l'm coming.
Since you were worried about
Sharat for the past 2 days,
l didn't tell you the good news.
- What is it?
You know that l love his
sister Parijatham, don't you?
Yes, l know.
You also know that she
put me to test, right?
Yes, l know.
He has passed me with full marks.
Brother...
- Don't be surprised.
l didn't pass him because
his painting was good.
l couldn't see his paintings everyday.
Let me talk.
Let our marriages
be on the same day.
What do you say, Sharat?
- As you say.
When Gyaneshwar's sister is
getting married to Bottu Seenu,
how should the marriage be?
- Twin cities should celebrate.
He thinks you're Bottu Seenu.
lnnocent guy.- Yes.
Let's perform their marriage
as fixed earlier.
We have to buy saris & jewels for
my daughter-in-law.- Okay mother.
She thinks you're the King.
- She is innocent.
Hey Sharat...
- Why did you call me like that?
Not you. Him.
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.
Why did you come here?
l didn't know that you'll be here.
Sharat...
- Yes.
He is calling me not you.
Tell me.
- lnvite your friend to the marriage.
Heard what he said.
l'll kill you if you come to the marriage.
My grandfather says l'm useless.
But l am of great use to you.
Sharat, hereafter you have to act
like 3 people & satisfy them.
l wonder how you're going
to do that.
You're telling him as
if he is very new to this.
He is used to all that.
Why does he say ''used''?
