A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM
- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.
How are you doing?
- Much better. Thank you.
- Good to hear.
Congratulations, de la Torre.
She is a very lucky woman.
Not as lucky as I am.
- Monsignor.
- Good evening.
A pleasure seeing you.
Ah.
Your father would be so proud.
- You've fulfilled his wish.
- I would like to think so.
Don Felipe,
always such a pleasure seeing you.
You'll have to come by the house soon.
I have some new cigars
I think you'll enjoy.
You don't say.
Excuse me.
Ignacio.
Carmen, splendid as always.
I'm glad you came, Ignacio.
Amada is waiting for you.
So discrete.
It was his mother's ring, you know.
Poor woman.
If she knew where it ended up.
Well, Luz, it's on your sister's finger.
My half-sister.
Don't worry, you'll all find
good husbands, too, I'm sure.
Hmm. Yes, of course.
I hope mine's a foreigner.
Un Romain, perhaps.
Lorenza et Romain.
Obviously.
Will you excuse me?
Ladies.
I hope you have no objection
to my stealing Amada.
And not a minute too soon, I'm sure.
To think in my hometown
all I wanted was a little sister.
You look beautiful.
Félix!
Ignacio.
I knew something was missing
from this party.
Mr. President, I apologize for being late.
Félix.
Effusive, as always.
Congratulations, Ignacio.
I hear you've been appointed to Congress.
What a nice wedding present.
No doubt Mr. President is a very...
generous man.
Only with those who deserve it.
Thank you for your trust, Mr. President.
What is given can also be taken away.
That said, I expect you will uphold
your end of the deal, Ignacio.
To make my daughter happy.
I'll do my utmost to ensure
that this is the case.
But Villada is one
of the president's men.
And now, so am I.
Does Díaz know about this?
I wanted to consult with you first.
If he finds out,
he'll consider it treason.
Do you...
or do you not want to replace Villada?
Absolutely.
But why replace him with you?
If the president were to change
the official candidate...
who else would you choose?
I may have forgotten,
but I don't think I've seen you before.
I just started here.
Evaristo Rivas.
- Ignacio de la Torre.
- Pleased to meet you.
Likewise.
Do you usually stay here so late?
It's a bad habit.
It is one I share.
Hmm.
May your union be fertile.
May you both see
the children of your children,
and after a long and happy journey
on this earth,
may you be among the blessed
who are greeted
into the Holy Kingdom of Heaven
by Jesus Christ, our Lord.
Amen.
It's almost a miracle
everything turned out so well.
So many people were dancing when we left.
Even Luz congratulated me.
The Limantours left early though.
I hope it wasn't because of the food.
Don't you think we've had enough to drink?
It is never enough.
This is Dolores, your personal maid.
Socorro and Francisca
are the other two maids.
Doña Gertrudis, the cook.
Marco is the valet.
Doroteo,
Francisco, Roberto, Aníbal...
and Lucas.
Isidro is cook's assistant.
As is Juan.
And Mateo is the stable boy.
I was about to leave, and...
I thought you might fancy a drink.
I was going to work for my father,
but, uh, that wasn't going to end well.
So I came here instead.
Is your whole family still in San Luis?
Let's just say the distance does us good.
When my father was alive...
I would always volunteer
to visit the estates.
The further, the better.
Yes, the further, the better.
What does Mrs. Rivas say?
There isn't one.
Waiting for the right one?
And waste my time?
- Yes?
- Congressman.
I'm about to leave.
Is there anything else?
- No, thank you. You may go.
- Very well. If you'll excuse me.
Of course.
That was nice.
You need to...
loosen the wrists.
And simply let your fingers fall
on the keys with their own weight.
I may not know how to play the piano,
but I bet you don't know another woman
who can clean, load, and fire a rifle.
No, fortunately.
What are you doing up so late?
I was waiting for you.
I don't like you
losing sleep on my account.
It's the only way for me to see you.
Amada, it's not decent for you
to be like this in the parlor.
Everyone's retired for the night.
There is still work
I haven't quite finished yet.
Can't it wait till tomorrow?
It's for your father.
Senator Téllez.
Please, after you.
Very kind of you. Thank you.
A box of El Buen Tono, please.
Good luck in the session tomorrow.
It tastes a little sweeter than a peach.
Try it and tell me what you think.
Well, the nation's son-in-law
honors us with his presence.
Please, show some respect.
Ignacio.
How do you do?
Mr. de la Torre!
Tell your wife that we ladies
simply loved her dress.
It was divine.
- Who made it?
- All right.
- Leave it. I'll get you the name later.
- No, no, no, don't give her ideas.
It's really difficult.
Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
I'll see you again later.
So, how is the married life?
Some duties
are more difficult than others.
I met someone who could fit in well here.
Let me guess.
You've invited him.
Ignacio.
Why do we have rules?
For the others.
Nacho.
If you ever do this again...
I'll have to kick you out.
That's the truth.
- To your health.
- Look who it is!
Ta-da! Come over here.
Oh, good.
There is no way. Nobody would.
That way the queen is still protected.
- Let's say I didn't move the pawn.
- Right.
- See what happens?
- Yes.
All right, gentlemen. Who is going to...
I'm an old fox!
Thank you, doctor.
The doctor says you should rest.
She won't forgive me
for not inviting her to the wedding.
Carmelita and my father wouldn't let me.
And now everybody knows
that my mother is an Indian.
How long has it been
since you've seen her?
Six years.
Ignacio.
You and Papa are all I have.
Get some rest.
Whoa!
You need to uncover your chest.
Excuse me?
You may still leave if you wish.
Evaristo Rivas.
Have you come of your own free will?
Yes.
And do you know
what unites us in brotherhood?
Socratic love.
And do you, Evaristo Rivas,
confess to being eligible
to join our society?
I confess.
I'm a pansy.
Do you swear to never disclose,
even under pressure,
what takes place here?
I swear.
Evaristo,
welcome to our club, which is now...
The Club of the 42!
Gentlemen...
let us raise our glasses
in honor of our new member.
Cheers!
I've never seen
so many queers under one roof.
I knew you would appreciate.
- Did you go through this as well?
- Mmm-hmm.
Who introduced you?
Don Felipe.
He was a close friend of my parents.
He invited me when I turned 18.
Maximilian passed on the club to him
before he was executed.
Can somebody pass the wine, please?
Well, my glass is looking a little empty.
You will love it.
That is Aristeo.
He's the only founding member left,
but unfortunately, he rarely comes now.
Cheers!
- Cheers!
- To your health.
Those are two senators.
And over there, that's Agustin.
The newest member until you arrived.
Gabriel introduced him and
they both like to wear women's clothing.
Carlos is a board member
of the Bank of London.
A very interesting man,
but a bit complicated at times.
Gustavo is a bit of an introvert,
but he's very nice.
And there's Rafael.
You already met him.
Welcome.
Thank you.
Ah, yes, that feels good.
- Where were you?
- Dinner went long.
- With whom?
- With friends.
I was very worried.
I'm sorry.
I didn't have time to let you know.
I sent a message to my father's house.
They're searching for you.
Why did you do that?
You didn't return.
I assumed something terrible
had happened to you.
Next time this happens,
don't worry so much about me.
We wouldn't want you to fall ill again.
What's going on here?
These gentlemen are asking for you.
If you'll excuse us, sir.
We were told something unfortunate
had happened to you.
- As you can see, I'm fine.
- Our apologies.
You'll have to ask him.
His office is over there.
Beautiful apology.
Accepted?
Wouldn't it look better with a bracelet?
A pair of earrings, perhaps?
If something truly unfortunate
were ever to occur...
at least we know
we can count on my father.
That's a relief.
Did you think
I wouldn't find out?
Pardon me?
You're conspiring against me.
Mr. President, I would never dare.
In that case,
how would you call going behind my back
to promote an agenda I strongly oppose?
It's no secret the ranchers
are displeased with Villada.
They believe I could defend
their interests better
since I share those interests.
And they suppose
I'll support you.
Are they mistaken?
You don't even meet
the criteria to be governor.
You need to grow up.
You've never shied away
from amending the law
to benefit the people, Mr. President.
How's my daughter?
Happy.
As always.
This conversation is over until
you reach the legal age.
- Mr. President...
- Ignacio!
De la Torre. Your turn.
My wife thinks it would be a good idea
to make him a little suit.
But I don't think
it's a suitable gift for a young boy.
Not very exciting.
How old is he now?
Ten.
A bicycle.
- Aren't they dangerous?
- Yes, terrible.
Riding on cobblestones
you get thrown around like a rag doll.
I think there's a new model
with inflatable tires.
Ha! What will they invent next?
Well, if that's the case,
I'll definitely get him a bicycle.
And the suit, of course.
I wouldn't want to upset my wife, would I?
How modern of you!
I don't mean the tires,
but for being so concerned about Carolina.
When you're part of a family,
you have to compromise.
That's something you'll never understand.
Do you live here?
Since they drove me out of my house.
One has to go out.
Meet new people.
- I think you're in the right place.
- Uh-huh.
Do you want to have some fun?
Gentlemen, my most profound apologies,
but I must leave you.
One more. A rematch.
It was an excellent performance.
You would've liked...
And you?
You don't even say hello?
Congressman, how are you?
I thought we had an understanding.
And I thought you had
more important things to do.
Ignacio.
- Stay a little longer.
- No, it's late.
He likes to ride his mare
early in the morning.
Come with me.
Eva.
- Eva.
- Mmm.
Put the chair
in front of the mirror
and the candle closer to the bed.
Ignacio.
What are you doing?
I don't want you staying up because of me.
Please, Ignacio, don't change rooms.
We haven't even been married a year yet.
What's wrong?
The doctor said
that you need to sleep well.
Did I upset you?
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.
Nothing.
This arrangement is more suitable.
For your health.
They agreed to leave us alone
in the box for a moment.
When he gave me the ring,
the audience applauded.
I would love a story like that!
There are plenty of stories like that.
The problem is always what comes after.
And so tell us, Amada,
what comes after?
I really can't complain.
The other day, Ignacio offered me
a beautiful diamond necklace.
I really couldn't refuse.
Has he had more dinners
that last until the next day?
Luz!
Don't be impudent.
No, Luz.
No, no more long dinners.
Well, my dear,
I say you should enjoy it while it lasts.
These things tend to disappear
when you least expect it.
One day you're his sun,
and the next he's getting warmed up
in someone else's glow.
Isn't that right, Carmelita?
- Elena, would you like a glass of water?
- No.
Anyone else would like one?
- Yes, please.
- No, thank you.
Isn't this a perfectly lovely afternoon?
Do you like the gift I sent you?
I didn't think you would get
so many signatures.
Now we're just missing
the most important.
Alvaro, Manuel.
I want you to prepare a detailed report
on the political viability
of this young man here.
Of course, Mr. President.
Thank you very much.
It's not a "yes," Ignacio.
It's a "we'll see."
If you'll excuse me.
What position?
Governor of the State of Mexico.
Coward, you have dishonored the woman.
Ah! On your guard!
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Such a tragic pene... tration.
Oh, no!
He had gonorrhea!
Bravo!
Whoo!
If I may take this opportunity,
since we're all here,
to announce that our annual ball
will be held on 17th of November.
♪ In the immensity ♪
♪ Of the waves, floating I saw you ♪
♪ And going to save you
And going to look for you ♪
♪ The whole thumb I stuck in ♪
With the big toe!
♪ Your sweet vision... ♪
It's all or nothing.
There's no other way to go about it.
Don't be so sure. You have many friends.
- It's not impossible. That's right.
- Of course not.
- Ladies, I think I'll be turning in now.
- Don't be such a party pooper!
- No, no, no.
- Why, Nachito?
Because I have to work on
my campaign for governor, that's why.
- Governor of what?
- What do you think? Of Sodom!
- Of the State of Mexico.
- Even worse.
I really think you could be president,
Nachito.
Evaristo could be First Lady!
Indeed! I like that.
Just teasing. Great idea.
Gentlemen, can you imagine?
Our next orgy could take place
at the Chapultepec Castle.
- Yes! I'll wrap myself in the flag.
- Ignacio de la Torre for governor!
- Long live Nacho!
- Shut up already!
- Shh.
- Oopsie.
Shh.
Mr. de la Torre.
Mr. de la Torre!
Don't forget your girlfriends
when you set up your cabinet.
Well said.
- Careful, don't encourage them.
- Shh.
What is going on, Félix?
People have been talking, Amada.
I WOKE UP SHAKING TO THE SOUND OF
YOUR KISSES ON MY BACK. EVA.
I'm new at the office.
They're treating me very well.
My husband treats you very well.
Actually,
I work with various senators, and...
I invited Eva
to spend the evening with us.
I see you have been going through
my letters.
You leave me no choice.
- I should come back another time.
- Sit down.
My husband is exhausted
from working so much.
But I'm sure you know that better than I.
I was just telling Amada
about my work as your lawyer.
Hmm.
- Eva and I were talking about spending...
- Mr. Rivas, Amada.
Speak properly.
You are not in your village anymore.
Do you mind me calling you Eva?
No.
Eva and I were talking about
spending time in the country on...
Mr. Rivas won't be able to.
He's very busy with the contracts.
- I thought it was a new bill.
- That too.
Why did you come?
Because the invitation was in your name.
Mr. and Mrs. Ignacio de la Torre.
Please don't ever come here again.
Give it to me.
I will not ask again.
Give it to me.
I'm not stupid enough to keep them there.
Amada!
Amada, what are you doing up there?
Amada!
Leave me alone!
You'll slip and fall.
Since when do you care what happens to me?
Get back in the house.
You get back in the house!
Amada!
Go away!
Ignacio,
you have to give me a child.
If you don't, I will reveal what I know.
What will they say about you?
We are married, Amada.
The least you can do
is keep up appearances.
For me.
Doesn't everyone believe
that we are...
deeply in love?
He probably
won't come tonight either.
Evaristo, it isn't wise
to behave like this.
As if you were husband and wife.
It will not end well.
COME BACK, I MISS YOU
EVA
I'm afraid the electorate
doesn't have the best opinion of you.
I'm sure you can find
a more favorable sample.
With all due respect, congressman,
your way of life has people talking.
How do I know the results are not biased?
Because I'm in charge.
The last three reelections,
I'm the one who advised the president.
I strongly advise you not to run.
Truth is,
you don't stand a chance of winning.
And the general doesn't like to lose.
Doña Carmen. Mr. President.
Ignacio.
I'm glad you could find the time.
- Did Alvaro and Manuel deliver the report?
- Porfirio... not now.
Not yet.
There will be plenty of time over dinner
to discuss these things.
- ...represented an extreme duality.
- Yes, but more restrained.
Yes, unlike today.
- Nowadays it seems...
- Things have changed.
...social encounters
are much more casual.
Yes.
- More enjoyable. Huh.
- Less formal.
Your home is truly lovely.
Thank you, Doña Carmen.
It's a pleasure to have you with us.
Red snapper with sauce ravigote, Papa.
Just the way you like it.
Look at you.
Soon you'll be teaching Luz
how to host a dinner party.
I find it a little dry.
It's delicious.
Later.
All you need now
is to be a mother.
Porfirio.
What?
I can't say that?
I want grandchildren.
How long have you been married now?
- Ignacio.
- We're working on it.
That's what I wanted to hear.
Do you know where
the word ravigote comes from?
- No.
- From the French.
It means invigorate.
This sauce invigorates
the diners' appetite,
from the time it is made
to the time it is eaten.
How are you today?
What are you doing here?
Is a wife not allowed
to visit her husband?
What are you doing?
I will cure you.
May God free you from your sin.
May God free you from your sin.
May God free you from your sin.
May God free you from your sin.
May God free you from your sin.
Touch me again
and I'll have you locked up in an asylum.
I'm not afraid of you,
I was born on a battlefield.
Get out.
Not until you give me a child.
Let go of me!
Ignacio.
Ignacio, give me a child.
Ignacio.
Amada, open up.
It's for you own good.
Amada, open the door.
Amada! Open up.
Open up!
Amada!
What is it, my daughter?
I'm worried about Ignacio, Papa.
Whatever you need, Amada.
What's wrong?
I'm being followed.
By whom?
I don't know, but I know who sent them.
Were you followed?
No, I...
I don't think so.
Let's get out of here.
Where to?
Let's leave the country.
That's pure lunacy.
I know.
We were starting to be quite worried
about you, Nachito.
What is this?
Your new bodyguards.
I don't need them.
That's not your decision to make.
Very well.
- Have them watch over Amada.
- No.
They're for you.
You don't have the authority.
You're mistaken, Ignacio.
I have all the authority.
And if you don't like it,
I suggest you speak to the president.
Nachito.
Lead them outside, Teo.
They can't be in here.
Thank you, Teo.
- Who is it from?
- Amada, this is unbearable.
Who is it from?
The tailor.
There's a lot of pressure, sir.
I understand there's pressure,
but what do they want?
They want a meeting with you.
No, I can't do that. Tell them...
Congressman?
Tell them I've postponed running
until the next election cycle.
There you go.
You look gorgeous.
- And this one here?
- There you go.
Let me tie it up.
Ah, yes.
You'll look beautiful in this dress.
Midnight raffle!
Forty-two tickets, only one winner.
Anyone feeling lucky?
- Wonderful! Whose idea was this?
- Midnight raffle!
Wait your turn.
- Hey, hey.
- May I have a ticket, please?
I need one, too.
You look...
beautiful.
Forty-two tickets, only one winner.
May I?
Do you want one?
No.
Oh, you got two.
Get your ticket for the midnight raffle.
The train leaves at 7:00.
Shall we?
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Thank you.
Cheers.
That's it. That's it.
- Circle them!
- That's it.
Stay back.
Come on. You there, move. Get in there.
That's right.
What is it?
A raid was conducted
in La Paz Street during a party.
At first,
everything seemed perfectly normal,
but then I realized
it was attended only by men.
Get to the point, Félix.
Those who seemed to be women...
were men wearing dresses.
We arrested 42 men, sir.
I only count 41.
My son will find out.
My son will find out.
And I'm going to die.
My son will find out and I'm going to die.
Get this faggot out of here.
Shame on you! Faggots!
- You should be ashamed of yourselves.
- Homos!
Dirty perverts!
Go to hell you fucking swines!
Abhorrent!
You're disgusting!
- You should be ashamed of yourselves.
- You sicken me.
Awful!
- Faggots!
- Dirty perverts!
Shame on you all!
Rot in hell, you despicable perverts.
To prison with them!
Those present here
are an example of the putrefaction
that must be eradicated from our society.
May the chastisement of these sick people
serve as an example for all those
who seek to go against
the principles of morality.
Let it be clear.
Filthy, evil weed will be uprooted
without any hesitation.
For the good of our society
and the safety of our families.
You faggots!
Shame on you!
You should be ashamed of yourselves!
I asked my father to leave you in prison.
Did you tell your father about Evaristo?
Why?
God sees all.
Amada, I beg you.
If you help me
get Evaristo out of jail, I promise...
He was sent to Yucatán.
At least there
he'll be able to atone for his sins.
Congressman.
The president wants to know if he can
count on your vote during the session.
Tell him he can.
It is the premiere of La Bohème
at the Teatro Principal.
Shall we go?
If you want.
Or would you rather go to Tacubaya
for the weekend?
Ignacio.
Sorry, what?
Would you rather go to the opera
or the summer house?
I don't care.
Evaristo is dead.
I don't have any more information,
I just know he died.
So, La Bohème or Tacubaya?
