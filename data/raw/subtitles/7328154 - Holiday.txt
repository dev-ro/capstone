- Oh, I think it says
declined.
Do you have another card?
- Hello?
- Hello, Sascha.
- Hello?
Sorry?
- Everything okay
at the airport?
- Sure.
- Okay, I'm outside.
- Okay.
- White car.
- See you out,
I'll come down now.
- See you soon.
- Okay, in a second, bye.
Bye.
There is this one little thing,
I had to borrow just a
little bit of the money.
Well, it was just, it's
a little over 300 euros,
and yeah, I know it's
really stupid, it just.
Yeah, really stupid, I know.
Gee.
I was in the shop, and I
couldn't pay,
and the lady, she just
looked at me I was...
- How fucking old are you?
Pretty girls,
everything's for free,
and nothing is, no
consequence, not really.
Just a little smile,
maybe sucking off the right guy.
That's the way the
world works, huh?
You're not gonna be
sucking me off,
if that's what you're thinking.
That, what is gonna happen,
I'm gonna tell Michael that
this new girl is too stupid
to be trusted in
anything at all,
and he's gonna send you flying
out the window, all right?
- Please.
- Sorry?
- Please, I'm so sorry.
- I don't give a fuck.
- Please.
- Look at me.
Look at me.
Look at me, take your hand down.
I said take your fucking hand
down now.
Look at me.
Can you see, something
even remotely like this
will never happen again,
do you understand?
Do you understand?
- Yeah, never, never.
- This is your one
and only warning.
- Thank you.
- Damn right, now,
give me the money,
and get the fuck out of here.
- There is 49,600 euros in
here...
- Get out of the car.
- It is a white
diamond,
and it has a very nice
color, you can see there,
these were custom.
- Beautiful.
- It was made in.
- You can put
that one away for me.
- If you like
it, it's 20,000 pounds.
- 20,000?
That's not too bad.
- Yes, this is a nice gift,
maybe, what do you think?
- What do you think of this?
- You would like them?
Oh, all right.
That's pretty.
- There's something.
- Oh, yes.
- Well, how much would...
- Mastic,
what is mastic?
- I feel so boring now.
- Yeah.
- You know?
- Yeah, no, I was
gonna order vanilla,
but now, I mean...
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Strawberry?
- You don't look like
vanilla at all.
- What?
- You don't look
like vanilla, at all.
- I don't?
- No.
- And what do I look like, then?
- Yeah, I think
that's good, thanks.
- Let me see.
- Do you have some
sauce?
- Strawberry cheesecake,
strawberry cheesecake.
- No.
- No?
What would you say?
- I would say strawberry
champagne sorbet.
- So I was right about
the strawberry?
- Yeah.
- And almost champagne?
- Hello.
- Hello, I'm Tomas, hi.
- Oh, hi.
- This is Frederik.
- Hi, Sascha, you said?
- Sascha, yeah.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Tomas, Frederik.
- Frederik, yes.
- He's a real estate agent,
I used to be in marketing,
but now I live on a boat.
- Okay.
- Just sail the
seven seas.
- Really?
- Yeah, and you,
you're on a holiday?
- Yeah, me and my friend, yeah,
we are on holiday,
just a bunch of...
- Where do you stay?
- A bunch of friends together
in a villa,
yeah, in the mountains, yeah.
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah, it's beautiful.
- Barbecuing,
the pool, right?
- Yeah, nothing else, yeah.
- Really, sounds great.
- Yeah, we're just
barbecuing all day.
Ooh, sorry, sorry.
- Go away, please, go away.
Go away.
Go away!
- Welcome, welcome.
- Thank you, how are you?
- I'm good, good to see
you, good to see you,
you look good.
- Thank you very much, a
little present for the friends.
- Wow, some sandals?
- Just...
- Right on.
- Something.
So how's the driver, is he good?
- He's very
good, he's very good.
- I'm so glad,
this is our new guy, yes?
- Can you move on?
- And you remember
Sascha.
- How are you?
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you?
- Good, you, good.
- And this is?
- This is Emil.
- Emil, hi.
- Yeah, it's a little one.
- How are you?
- Thank you very much.
For the princess, make
a little drink here.
That's gonna be fun.
Would you excuse
me for one second,
while I just serve
my girlfriend a drink?
- Yeah, I'll just,
yeah, I'll just.
- Hello.
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm good.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I'm just,
I'm having, hi.
- Hello, hi.
- Were you standing
here a long time?
- Yeah, I heard how
amazing you were.
- Oh, God.
- No, no, no, no.
- That's interesting.
- No, I just, I just
came, I'm having dinner
with some friends, and...
- Oh, sit down.
Oh, okay, oh,
you're having dinner.
- Yeah, exactly, so, but
yeah, I just wanted to say hi.
- That's so sweet, well, hi.
- Hi.
- Where are you guys from?
- We're Danish.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and you're Dutch, right?
- Yes, we are.
- Yes, you are.
- Yeah, but we met here,
actually,
Frederik is working
here, he's from Bodrum.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Hey, Sascha.
- I was just texting you back.
- Hi, hi.
- Hi.
- It's good to see you
again, you look beautiful.
- Thank you.
- So you were bored?
- You know when they, like,
when they put this really
big bottle of alcohol
and fancy, on the table?
- Yeah.
- And it's supposed to be, like,
so exclusive, and then, then
at a point, you realize,
this is the same shit that I
used to drink
when I was, like, 15, to
get drunk really cheap.
- Yeah.
- So, yeah.
- I don't like these kind of
folks at all.
- No?
- No.
I like, you know, it
looks beautiful, right?
- Shall we go?
- You want to go?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sure.
- So glad you texted me,
I fell asleep on the boat.
- Oh, so did
I wake you up?
- Yeah, but,
but thank God you did,
otherwise it would
have been a very, oh?
- I think I
have to take these off.
- Yeah, your shoes.
- Yeah.
- Wow.
Can you even walk on them?
- A lady knows
how to wear high heels.
- Yeah.
You stay here
with friends, right?
Are they, they're good
friends from back home?
- Yeah, I mean,
they, they all know each other
'cause they all lived at Ama,
which is this place near
Copenhagen,
and some of them are
friendly or something,
and two of them
have a kid together.
MDMA.
- Oh, wow.
- You want to do some?
- Sure.
- Sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- Let's do some.
I like this so much, it's
so nice when you.
Chemical.
- Is this too much?
- No, that's fine.
- Ugh.
Oh, fuck, this is so.
- I kind of like it.
I kind of like the taste of it.
- So now we just wait?
- Now we just wait.
- Will you dance after
her?
- Yeah,
sure, do you want me to?
- No, both naked.
- Well.
Maybe, for the right
price, I might, for you.
- Sing.
- You want me to sing?
- Yeah.
Hello?
You know Torba?
Torba's this way?
Thank you.
Yeah?
What?
Sorry, I don't.
Oh, shawl, okay, thank you.
Thank you, bye.
Yeah.
Ow, ow, ow.
- Oh, fuck.
- Alka.
- Alka?
- Yes.
- Really, Alka?
- Alka.
- Halka?
- Halka.
- Do you have a
telephone?
Can I write my number?
- Go ahead.
- Can I?
- Go ahead.
- Do you have it?
- What's your name?
- Tanja.
- Hey.
- Tanja.
- Hey, wait, but
push it now, push it now.
- Who is it?
- I don't know.
- Tomas?
Tomas?
Hello?
Hello.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Wow.
Wow, wow, you're actually here.
- Yes.
- That's so nice.
- Hi.
- Hey, how are you?
- Hey, I'm good.
- I didn't think I
would see you again.
- No, you didn't?
- No, no.
- Hello, Sascha,
nice to see you again.
- Hi, hi.
- You look beautiful.
- Do I?
- Oh my god.
Wow, how did you get here?
- Yeah, I was at the restaurant.
- Yeah?
- And then, then I thought
I would just go look
for the boat with
the Dutch flag.
- With the Dutch flag.
- Yes.
- Just across there, it's.
- Were you standing
here a long time, or?
- No, no, I just came.
- Oh, okay, great.
- Yeah, yeah, I just came.
- We've got white wine,
and cheese and crackers,
would you like
to join us, please?
- I do.
- Nice timing.
- Please?
- You enjoy, well,
I think I have to get back to...
- No, no, not again.
- Oh, come on.
- No.
No.
- I'm sorry.
- It's nice white wine,
tangy and peachy
and oak-y, and Turkish, and
cheap,
and , but it's
supposed to be really nice.
- Okay, okay.
- It's the best you can get.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Please?
- So after you?
- Please, let's go.
- Yes.
- Come on.
Good.
- Hey, what happened
to your neck?
- It was just a small
accident
in the scooter, it was,
it was really nothing.
- Wow, that's...
- My lady,
can I have your hand?
- It looks
insane, right?
- Wait, now, this
is a little bit unbalanced, but
there you go, there you go.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- So this is
where the party is at.
- Hello.
- How are you guys?
- Hi.
I'm sorry, can we help you?
- This is, um...
- I'm Michael.
- Hello, Michael.
- Hi, I'm
Sascha's boss.
- Oh my god, oh, really?
- Don't worry,
I'm not a party pooper.
- Oh, hi, hi, nice to meet you,
I'm Tomas.
- Tomas?
- Yes.
- Nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you.
We've got white wine
and cheese, and...
- Hi there.
- Please, please.
- I'm Frederik.
- Hi,
nice to meet you.
- What do
you want to drink?
- White wine is
perfect.
- White wine it is,
man,
white wine it is, welcome.
- I ended up in sales, which
was, like,
this huge mistake, I mean,
the way they pressure you to
perform,
it's like, it's important
for the whole world
that people use this green
toilet cleaner instead
of the blue one, you know what I
mean?
Yeah, and it's really
addictive, you know, the rush,
the physical rush of lying
successfully to someone,
it's really dangerous, it's
really awful.
And I started thinking that
the whole world was like that,
lying and deceitful, and
I got really filled up
with this feeling of hate,
and then just one day, I,
I just walked out of there.
And I don't know exactly
what happened, but
I decided that,
you know, whatever I
would do with my life,
I would never, ever be
this careless with my soul.
- Your soul?
- Yeah.
- Your soul?
- Yeah.
- What do you mean?
- Well, a soul.
Is that hard to?
Whatever.
- But there's...
- I sold the apartment,
and I bought this boat,
And I sailed the seas, and
I know it sounds corny,
I know it does, absolutely, but
it worked.
She gave me everything.
I feel so free, and.
Can I get you something warm?
You're freezing.
- It's fine.
- You're sure?
- Yes.
- You want, can I take,
a blanket or something?
- Go get her a blanket.
- Yeah, sure, why not?
- Come on, be a.
- No, it doesn't even
smell bad, so there you go.
- Thank you.
- There you go, that's better.
- That's good.
- So tell me, all right.
- Yeah?
- You were in sales, and you
feel this emptiness, right?
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, it's like everything
is, doesn't give meaning.
And then you buy this boat.
- Yeah.
- Did it take away the
emptiness?
- Well, that's a good question.
It does most of the time,
I guess.
- But you don't, you
don't seem like this guy
that is completely full.
- No, and what do I look like?
- A guy that gets a lot of
pussy out of having a boat.
- Oh, wow.
- It's a great...
- Really?
- Fellatio ride.
- Oh, okay, okay.
- I don't know, it's just, you
know.
- I hope he's right.
- Well,
well, you know
he isn't right, right?
- No, not really.
- I'm sitting here every
night with him.
- Does that mean...
- And that's true?
- True, absolutely.
- That's true.
- That means you actually
get a lot of pussy.
- Sorry?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Hi, hey, Tomas, this is
Michael from the other night,
the grumpy old guy.
Yeah, I was thinking about
buying a boat,
and you seem kind of the
guy that knows about boats.
I was just wondering
if I could tempt you,
if I threw a couple of really
juicy steaks
on the grill tonight,
I hope you're not one
of these fucking vegetarians.
And I've got some wines,
and they're not bad at all.
And he gets into his truck,
and he just drives out the,
the, it was the little pathway,
and out comes this little
dude with a big fucking gun,
you know, and points
at the truck.
And the guy gets out of the
truck,
and he points the gun at
him, and so, like, all right,
"Do it with yourself."
- What?
- "Do it with yourself."
And the truck driver's like,
"What, what the, what?"
"Do it with yourself," you
know, he's standing there
with a gun, so he, you
know, unzip, you know,
and takes it out, and starts
jerking off, you know?
And it's very hard
situation to jerk off to,
you know, this guy's just
pointing at him.
And finally, he, like,
he's really working on it,
and then finally some,
a few drops comes out,
and he says, "Do it again."
Fuck, no, oh, shit, you
know, it's the second time,
you know, and he's just, and
he's red, and he's, like, sore,
itching, really, and he finally
squeezes a few drops out,
and suddenly he goes,
"Do it again."
He goes, fuck.
He really goes at it, and a
third time,
he just finally gets a little
drop out.
And then this beautiful woman
comes out of the bushes,
beautiful, with big breasts,
and brawny, and beautiful.
And this little guy
with the gun says,
"And now, you take
my sister to Napule."
Sometimes this works.
- I didn't get it, was that...
- That was the end?
That was the end?
- Yeah, "Now, you take
my sister to Napule."
He'd just jerked off
three times, you know?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
But I once told
it to an African guy,
and he was like, he was
looking at me, going,
"Well, give him 20 minutes,
he can fuck her anyway."
By the way, have you seen,
have you seen this big,
fucking monster boat at
the end of the harbor?
The one with the
blue thing on it?
- Yeah, the Russian one.
- The Russian, okay,
the Russian one, yeah.
That is awesome.
- You think?
- That's the kind
of boat I want,
I want that shape,
I want that size,
that's exactly a boat like...
- That's not ready a
boat I know much about,
but if it's the
Russian one, you mean?
- Yeah.
- I heard they're making
really a lot of trouble.
- A lot of trouble?
- Yeah.
- Don't worry about that,
don't worry about that,
'cause trouble is what
makes the world go round,
my friend, yeah, without
suffering,
we have no will to live.
What, ha?
- Now there's a joke I like.
You think so?
Wow.
- She's nice, isn't she?
- Yeah.
- You think you're
gonna fuck her tonight?
- Hmm?
- Well, maybe you already have.
Maybe you fucked
her when you did MDMA
on the beach, I don't know.
No, well, she says no, but.
I have a hard time
believing that,
you know, it is
a love drug, isn't it?
- I'm really sorry if
there has been some sort
of misunderstanding,
Michael, but...
- Misunderstanding?
- Yes, I thought she was
available, I,
I didn't know.
- Of course.
Available?
- Yeah, well, you
know what I mean.
- Well, of course she is,
come on.
- Hmm?
- Of course she is,
it's a free world,
she can do whatever
the fuck she wants.
I mean, look at her,
she's beautiful.
She's beautiful, she
needs attention of men,
and she grows from it.
- Can I ask you a question?
Why did you invite me here,
you want to buy a boat, really?
You want to talk about a boat?
- Well.
- Tell me.
- Actually, I don't
know why I invited you.
Maybe, you just got
me in a soft moment,
and I, you know, you're this,
you're this good-looking
guy, you know, young.
And I'm, like, this
fat, old rich guy on
the sofa, so I was just,
I don't know, I just
have a lot of experience
with women, you know, and
I just see your innocence,
it just, it just.
Maybe I just want to
teach you a little,
how to win a woman over.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- So show me.
- You want me to show you?
- Sure.
- All right, Sascha?
- Yeah?
- See this, she's all wet.
You know, this little
power game we're going,
that's really turning you on,
she's got her juices flowing,
right, you want to smell?
Come on, smell.
What?
- No, I don't want to smell.
- What?
You're not interested?
- No.
- Good, 'cause let me just
get one thing straight here,
so there's no misunderstanding,
you need to crawl back
to that little suburban
hole you came
from before I hurt you.
Understood?
- Sure.
- Good, get the fuck out
of my house before
I really hurt you.
Oh, Jesus.
- Hey.
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, so am I.
What about the
mark on your neck?
Does he hurt you,
does he abuse you?
- No, no.
- You're, you're sure?
Then what the fuck
is wrong with you?
Is this some stupid
game you guys play?
- No, no.
- No, are you sure?
- Yeah, no, I...
- Don't, don't touch...
Oh, fuck.
- Are you okay?
- Jesus, fuck.
- You okay?
- Don't touch me, what
the fuck is wrong with you?
Jesus.
How can you let yourself
be treated that way?
It's fucking disgusting,
go see a shrink,
you fucking psycho,
Jesus Christ.
You and your friends are all
gonna be dead
or in prison in five
years, really, trust me.
Now get the fuck out of
here, you stupid cunt.
What the fuck did you expect?
I was gonna sail away with you,
and live happily ever after?
Get the fuck out of here,
stupid, stupid, stupid.
- Do you speak English?
- A little.
- What?
- A little.
Are you okay?
- Hey, Frederik, hi.
- Hey.
- Hi, Frederik.
- Sascha, hey.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- I'm fine.
- What are you doing here?
- Actually, I'm
just waiting for Tomas.
- Okay, he's not here?
- No.
- Okay.
- No, no, he's not
here, I mean,
I've been waiting for him for
two hours.
- Two, did you try to call him?
- Yeah,
there's no answer.
- Okay.
- No.
- That's strange, yeah,
I had the same,
I tried to call him, so I
came out, and, you know,
see if he's here.
- Yeah, and he's not.
- No, for two hours,
are you okay?
- Yeah, maybe more, actually,
I feel like I've been waiting
for all morning, I'm just.
- Okay, that's a long time.
- Yeah.
I know I'm okay, I'm just,
I'm hungry, actually.
- Okay.
- Have you had lunch?
- Can I take you out?
- Yes, please.
- Yes, really?
- Yes.
- Let's go.
- Thank you.
- Here we go.
- And excuse me
for my broken heart,
now I already feel better.
- Your broken heart?
- Thank you.
- Well, tell me,
what's up?
- What's up, I
don't know, I just, I'm just,
just being stood up.
- 'Cause where
would you like to go?
- Maybe
somewhere with a view?
