- You're kidding yourself.
- You see evil everywhere.
No, I'm realistic, that's all.
Of course, it does happen,
sometimes--
Sometimes? Are you joking?
At the office, at school,
it's the same everywhere.
There's always a prick.
They're not all dishonest.
Give me a break.
You say that because they don't
tell you what's going on.
But if you dig a little...
lf you order 1 2 oysters
and one's bad,
you don't throw them all--
How many examples do we need?
The office, school, oysters.
l got it already.
You offer $20 to an oyster,
what's it going to do?
- Your example isn't a good one.
- Maybe this one isn't.
But you can't condemn everyone
because of one that's corrupt.
Maybe this guy was honest.
So why didn't he impose
an obvious penalty?
- Maybe he didn't see it.
- No?
- It's sneaky and underhanded.
- Who knows?
They're exactly the same.
We're well-positioned.
lt's a mere formality,
but it should clinch the deal.
On the other hand,
we can forget about Simpson.
I'm not surprised.
He's just a fag.
Miss!
Please, bring us some
little pastries, the little--
- Mignardises.
- Yes. And the check, please.
What?
Those are really bad for you.
l didn't have any dessert.
lt's exactly these little things
that you should avoid.
- We had a very rich meal.
- It's too late, anyway.
Do l have to go tomorrow?
Can't you go alone?
Why do l have to be there?
l thought it was a good idea.
But if you prefer--
l only know four English words.
l'll be there, asking you the
whole time, ''What's he saying?
''Tell him that...''
lt's going to slow things down.
- Go by yourself, l prefer--
- You have a 3:30 today.
A 3:30 appointment? With whom?
Mrs. Devaux,
the English teacher.
Oh, yes.
ls it really necessary?
You make what a month?
Eight thousand?
- More.
- Ten thousand?
- Iess.
- So, nine thousand.
- Iess.
- Who cares?
That's not the point.
I'm explaining something.
lmagine you're a referee.
A guy offers you some dough,
just like that.
He asks you to look
the other way. What do you do?
Give them a call to explain.
l'll call them right away to say
that 4:30 is better.
lt's just half an hour.
THE TASTE OF OTHERS
This Weber is a real gem.
Could you close
your window, honey?
Efficient, devoted.
l admire him, really.
- I give him enough money.
- Excuse me?
l pay him like a king.
He'd better be devoted.
The opposite would amaze me.
The money he earns
isn't important.
I'm talking about
human qualities, about...
He's such a smart dresser.
You should ask him
where he buys his suits.
l ate too much.
l won't eat.
An apple and right to bed.
You, eat an apple?
That would be surprising.
We're going to
the theater tonight.
Aw, shit!
Aw, hell!
Do l have to go, too?
Your niece knows we're coming.
Why did we tell her?
What the hell will we do there?
- Good afternoon, Mr. Castella.
- How are you, Gustave?
- Did we change the robot?
- Yes, last night. No problem.
- Did we lose much?
- About 1 0 hours.
The production's back on again.
Do they really have
to follow me everywhere?
That's the idea.
Frank. I'm not used to it,
so explain a little.
You must follow me everywhere?
That's what I'm paid to do.
Here in the plant?
What can happen?
A bad situation
can happen anywhere.
An attacker has
plenty of choices.
l think you're the one
who's going to...
Mrs. Devaux has been waiting
for 1 5 minutes.
- Who?
- Devaux.
- Your English teacher.
- Oh, yes, dammit. Iet her in.
When do we sign
with the lranians?
- Wouldn't l like to know.
- This bodyguard is oppressive.
- I know, but the insurance...
- Screw them.
Here you go.
- Good afternoon.
- Hi.
- Sit down, Mrs...
- Miss Devaux.
- You're an English teacher?
- Yes, l give English classes.
Do you have funny
teaching methods?
Funny? l wouldn't know
if my methods are funny.
How long will it take?
What?
OK.
You know what?
I'm going to think about it,
and l'll contact you.
So, we're done?
Yes. I...l'll call you.
OK. Alright.
You'll feel good here.
This is a nice apartment.
- Thanks to you.
- No, it's Jean-Jacques, really.
But it's really...
lt's really kind.
He's your brother.
lt's only natural.
- We never see each other.
- But he's your brother.
He couldn't let you sleep
in the streets with your kids.
He has money,
so he can help you.
He never held it against you.
What exactly?
That you ignored him.
He invited you over many times.
Paris is not that far away.
You never came.
You never came either.
Well...
Where are your children?
With their father.
He's going to help a bit?
l don't know.
lt's odd, l never liked
your husband from the beginning.
l did.
Some fabric would look nice
here, don't you think?
l was thinking about
this green--
Green? Oh, no, it's a cold
and harsh color.
Something warm, reassuring.
l don't know...
Dusty pink, maybe?
Or else a flowery fabric.
That's Flucky.
What's happening?
Fuck! I can't believe this.
ls this dog neurotic, or what?
- It's your dog?
- No need to be rude.
- Yes, it's my dog.
- Muzzle him.
He's dangerous.
The little shit got me!
- He bit him.
- What did you do?
What did l do? l was walking.
He doesn't like people walking?
There must be a reason.
Something must have happened.
l didn't do a thing!
Enough already!
Could you stop screaming?
lt's very upsetting.
- Keep calm.
- I'll bite your calf...
and see if you keep calm.
That's enough! Excuse him,
excuse him, end of story.
l asked him to keep calm,
and he threatened to bite me...
to see if l keep calm.
What a disagreeable
and aggressive fellow.
l thought he deserved it.
He was not a nice man.
Listen, you'll have to do
something. He bites a lot.
Yes, but, you know,
it's always with reason.
When he's bothered
or when people are mean.
- Dogs can feel that.
- Yes, that's true.
These seats are hell!
You want to have a bite?
Then we congratulate her.
No, Jean-Jacques!
That wouldn't be nice.
We're here now.
Some guy, armed
to the teeth, says,
''You move, you're dead.''
What do you do?
l don't move.
- You do like everyone else?
- There's nothing else to do.
l try to stay alive.
She looks like my fiancée,
that girl, something in her...
You have a fiancée?
l haven't met her.
She's not here. She's doing
an internship in the U.S.
- When will she get back?
- In four months.
You're patient.
I'm in love.
That helps.
l wanted to ask you something.
Have you ever killed someone?
Here, let us pause.
The splendor of these halls
is new to your eyes, Arsaces.
Oft to this chamber,
stately and withdrawn,
Titus often unburdens
his most secret thoughts.
Shit! They're speaking
in rhymes!
Here it is sometimes,
stealing from his Court,
he comes to whisper--
Those costumes are ugly.
This door gives access
to his private chamber...
and this other entrance
leads into the Queen's.
Go to her...
Tell her, loathe
to intrude on her,
l dare to ask her
for a private talk.
Yes, this must be painful.
That's fine.
You destroyed my larynx.
You're crazy. It hurts.
- What are you thinking about?
- I'm not thinking. I'm bored.
You looked like
you were thinking.
Castella is OK, but this job
is a fucking bore.
Can you buy me some cigarettes?
l can't move.
That's convenient, isn't it?
''l can't move.''
- What kind do you smoke?
- I don't care.
Thank you.
He won't be here all night?
lt's going to be hot. Thursday?
Yes. It would be nice
if you could do the closing.
l don't know. I'll have to see.
- There's someone at the bar.
- Oh, yes.
- Good evening.
- Could we eat something?
Yes.
Here you are.
Everything from here down.
You don't remember me?
Don't worry.
Miss? l'll have a...
ham and cheese.
Where did we meet, exactly?
I'm sorry...
lt doesn't matter.
We just had sex.
We had sex?
lt was a while ago. I've cut my
hair since, and we were smashed.
Yes, but it's amazing
that l wouldn't remember.
Don't worry. It happens.
More often to men,
but it happens.
lt's only natural. We're not
made equal physically.
lt's not the same act,
the same...involvement.
Let's drop it.
Or if we are not
master of our tears...
lsn't Virginie down there?
- At least let honor...
- That's her.
Let the whole world
plainly recognize...
an Emperor's tears and
the tears of a Queen.
For, my Princess, we must part.
Cruel.
ls this the time to speak?
What have you done?
l thought myself beloved.
Accustomed to the joy of seeing
you, l lived for you alone.
Did you not know your laws when
l first confessed my heart?
To what excess you've led me!
Why did you not say,
''Wretched Queen,
you are too far committed?
''Curb your hopes.
Give not your heart.''
Look at her face.
Did you not take it,
only to return it,
when its one wish
was to depend on you?
The empire planned
our downfall ceaselessly,
there still was time.
You could have left me then?
A thousand reasons then
could comfort me.
l could have blamed your father
for my death,
the people, the Senate,
the whole Empire, Rome,
rather than so dear a hand.
l know what torments
are in store for me.
l feel without you
l may no more live.
l had sex with this chick,
and l didn't remember.
lt was so fucking embarrassing.
And when she told me,
l had a good look, and
l still didn't remember.
lt's only natural.
Same thing could happen to me.
From the 200 or 300 l've fucked,
l would recognize 20.
Once you're drunk, once it's
dark, or when it's quick...
- You can't remember them all.
- Yeah, you're right.
ls ''200 or 300''
a figure of speech?
No, not at all.
I'm 45. I started at 1 5.
lf you average 8
to 1 0 chicks a year...
over 30 years,
30 times 1 0 is 300.
I'm 40. That's,
let's see...25 years,
multiplied by...
2, let's say...50.
- 50...not bad.
- Shit! You think too much.
No...l stayed with
a few of them.
What about you?
Yes. Once.
- Did you buy me cigarettes?
- I forgot. I'll be back.
Manie.
l should have remembered.
l didn't tell you it.
What? Go ahead.
Would you be interested
in going out one of these days?
- Just to talk.
- OK. I'll give you my number.
- Yes?
- Coffee, please.
Yes, right away.
Want to get a bite?
- Yes, of course.
- See you tomorrow.
- What a bore, what a bore!
- I liked it.
- You're silly.
- It's slow. It's way too slow.
You slow down the scene.
lt should go twice as fast.
- Where is Laurent?
- Virginie.
- Hi.
- Who's that guy?
The director.
- So, you're happy?
- Did you like it?
We didn't see you much.
lt was too short.
But you were cute. The costumes
were ugly, but you were cute.
- But did you enjoy the play?
- Oh, yes.
You don't know how to cry.
- The tears were--
- It's very difficult.
lt's hard for an actor, along
with the memorization, right?
Anyway, you had three lines.
- What's wrong?
- What's the problem?
- We're leaving, Valerie.
- I'm coming.
See you tomorrow.
We'll meet outside.
What's wrong?
l found it really good.
- On my tab?
- Yeah.
Let's go together,
it would be less boring.
l'd like to come.
l love the atmosphere.
The unemployment agency --
it's warm, convivial.
- I like being humiliated.
- I may not have enough hours.
What about the lbsen play?
l haven't heard a thing.
And you?
They're going nowhere.
They haven't got money.
lt's not happening.
- You're not constantly working?
- No, I'm not, after all.
I'm not an actress in demand.
Each time an actor tells me,
''I'm doing this and that,''
l want to strangle him.
Fred's always smiling at me.
ls it a tic, or what?
- Does he smile at you?
- Not particularly.
l have a soft little
black piece waiting for you.
Have you decided?
- Roast beef.
- Pot pie.
I'm hungry.
l also have
a little Moroccan stuff.
- Is the black stuff expensive?
- A gram is 60.
Wow! I don't know.
l'll stop by, and we'll see.
The table behind you, next to
Regine-Anne. Don't look now.
They were talking about
the play. They loved it.
And the guy with
the long hair...
He's very fond of you.
Don't look now!
- He's not bad.
- I think he's revolting.
- Revolting?
- I don't like his kind.
- Is there anybody you like?
- Why?
You don't like
any guy l show you.
That's not it at all.
So show me someone you like.
l don't know...
That man there in
the corner, for example.
Where? That old man, there?
Yes, but you see, he moves me.
- To have sex with him?
- It's not about that.
- Have sex with whom?
- With no one. That's the point.
lt's sad.
- I was trying to tell her--
- It's true...
l can't have casual sex,
l need to be in love.
lt has to be meaningful.
ls that so strange?
l just came for the check.
But...
How could l have forgotten?
- Maybe it wasn't you.
- Truly. You don't believe me?
You want one?
OK, why not?
l wanted to say...
I'm sorry to tell you this now,
but if l tell you later,
it will be...
even more...
lt wouldn't be very...
Anyway, l think it's better
if l tell you.
l have a girlfriend.
You are so cute.
Well, how's she doing?
- She's not here.
- I noticed.
She's in the U.S.
for six months.
How is it going?
l had no news
for three weeks, but...
the last time we talked,
she was OK.
No news...for three weeks.
Why don't you contact her?
She's never home.
Strange.
But I'm not worried.
l trust her.
- And you?
- Me...nothing.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Fine.
- Why didn't you call first?
When l called, you said tonight.
Yes, but, now...Sorry.
Come in.
He turns toward me and says,
''How could l forget?''
lt's funny, because at
the same time, l was thinking,
''How could l remember?''
- Here you go. 300.
- Thank you.
- Here.
- Thank you.
lt's closing night.
Every time I'm acting
for the last time,
it's as if l'll never act again.
Given my age,
it's likely to happen.
What do we call a 40-year-old
unemployed actress? Redundant.
lt's not the same for you.
You have talent.
Sure. What talent!
What's going on, Clara?
Are you depressed, or what?
Absolutely.
l don't know what to think
about my life anymore.
When you're 20, the uncertainty
and all that doesn't matter.
You have hope and lots
of imagination, and then...
But now I'm 40.
And I'm at the same place,
worrying about my rent.
As far as hope goes,
it's pathetic.
I'm alone. I have
two days to procreate.
Besides, l don't have
the father.
l don't want to go through this,
to find somebody.
lt's too tiring.
You were a bit pushy, abrupt.
One has to be careful with
these people, you understand?
- The way you deal with--
- What about it?
Let's just say sometimes
you should be more diplomatic.
l never do or say
the right thing.
You're always correcting me.
lt's like always being tested.
- You're a pain in the ass.
- I'm thinking of the company.
There are some constraints.
Things to do and not to do.
l must remind you of them.
- It's my job.
- I agree. I'm happy with you.
You're competent,
no doubt about that.
But why do you talk like
a government official?
Can't you talk
like anyone else? No?
What did l want to say...?
See you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
He's full of shit.
They graduate from
the Polytechnique and think...
l agree.
- Want me to drive you home?
- No.
Am l driving too fast?
I'm not even going 40.
But I'm not feeling well.
Your driving makes
me nervous, anyway.
I'm honest,
l always tell the truth.
Besides, it's dangerous
on these small streets.
lmagine if a child
crossed, or a dog.
ls this OK?
Yes, now it's OK.
Stop, Bruno!
- You scared me!
- You almost hit it.
What? Where?
Poor bird! Oh, poor little bird.
He's shaking like a leaf.
He's probably traumatized.
He's shaking like a leaf.
We're in the middle of the road.
Hello? Yes.
ls this Mr. Castella?
No, she's not available.
She has her hands full.
She's holding a bird
in her hands.
A bird.
She found it in the road.
Because it...it wasn't well.
All right.
He said he'll be back
tonight at about 1 1 :00.
l wished myself to hear
you in this place.
l'll hear no more.
And so farewell forever.
Forever...
Ah, my Lord,
reflect how harsh...
these cruel words fall
on a lover's ear.
ln a month, a year...
how great our pain will be,
with all the seas still
parting you from me?
When the day dawns
and when the day will end...
while Titus seeks
his Bérénice in vain,
and all day long
my never seeing you.
But how deceived l am!
Consoled of my departure
in advance,
he bids my absent days
untold remain?
These days so slow
will fly for him.
l will not have
many days, Madame.
My hope is soon
my sad renown...
will tell you were beloved.
You'll see that Titus
was unable to--
lf it's true, my Lord,
why separate?
l talk not of a wedding now.
Has Rome condemned me
not to see you more?
Do you begrudge me
even the air you breathe?
- What did l do in Act V?
- It was wonderful.
- Wonderful, Clara.
- I never did it like that.
More pins in my hair
than spectators.
No, it was crowded.
lt was perfect.
- Should l roll one?
- That would be nice.
Yes, come in.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Do you remember me?
l know you, but--
- The English lesson.
- Oh, yes. The funny methods.
My niece acts.
She's not really good, but--
- Who is she?
- Virginie Jerome. My niece.
Virginie is very good.
- She's a little...
- She's very good.
l don't like theater,
but tonight--
l can't stop crying.
That's stupid, but...
it was so good tonight,
you were good.
l saw the entire
second part, it was...
These closing nights
are painful.
- I don't like theater--
- Why did you come?
But, actually,
it didn't seem like theater.
Your acting is so--
You were wonderful.
Absolutely wonderful.
Tonight was magnificent,
just magnificent.
You saw the scene with Phenice?
Tonight there was...
a grace, a magic...
And Duclos was here.
- He finally came?
- He positively adored it.
He said he hadn't seen
a Bérénice like that since...
Thank you, my Clara, thank you.
- He'll write you. See you.
- Yes, bye.
You...You really are...
perfect.
Thank you. Excuse me,
l should change.
Sorry. Sorry.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
l've seen the show twice.
Who is he?
Shall we go, Mr. Castella?
What are we doing?
Mr. Castella?
What?
Let's go.
You're not hungry?
Very low level...
l was working with a tough guy.
His name was Turtle.
Chief lnspector Turtle.
- Iike a turtle?
- Yes.
l liked the guy. A pain in
the neck, but l respected him.
You don't meet a guy
like that every day.
Anyway...
We were after a client,
untouchable, see?
Powerful. You look forward
to the moment you'll get him.
ln this business, you're always
happy to destroy a guy...
who is above the law.
- And then?
- And then...
He was really above the law.
We busted our asses for months,
and it was over in one day.
Case over. Everybody goes home.
Go have fun somewhere else.
The law...my ass!
- So you guys resigned.
- I did.
l did.
- Turtle, he stayed?
- Yes.
Turtle, he shut up. Not a word.
I'm going to bed. I'm exhausted.
- What time is your date?
- She should be arriving now.
- It's the girl from the bar?
- Yeah.
That's your way
of being in love?
l don't see why not.
You still don't have news?
Maybe she's like you.
Maybe.
- OK, l see.
- You don't see anything.
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.
- How are you?
- Fine.
Frank, this is Manie.
- You want something to drink?
- Coffee and cream.
May we have a coffee and cream?
- So, you're the bodyguard?
- Yes.
lt's a cool job, isn't it?
No, not really.
- Oh, really?
- No.
l'll leave you alone.
Excuse me? Hello?
You should go.
You don't have to wait.
l know. Don't worry.
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Thank you.
- Do you know Bruno well?
- No, not very well.
We have sex every 1 0 years.
You have some free time, then.
These cell phones are awful.
l have to pick her up
at 7:00 a.m.
Well...l have to get up at 6:00.
l'll call you.
- Sleep well.
- Bye.
I'm upset, because she asked me
to take care of the decorating.
lt wasn't my idea.
l did it because
she's your sister,
and because the poor girl...
Anyway...
l find magnificent stuff,
and she never agrees.
l told her to do it
or to let me do it.
lt's my profession, after all.
She doesn't know what she wants.
She has to live there.
But considering that she asks
for professional help,
which is good,
because she has no taste,
why doesn't she listen
to my advice?
l try to make her appreciate
beautiful things, and...
she's totally closed-minded,
she turns against me.
- You should talk to her.
- I won't.
l won't interfere.
Can l have a beer?
Your son called. He didn't
receive the money order.
Why do you say ''your son''?
He's not yours?
- It's a figure of speech.
- I sent it eight days ago.
- He's in England, not in China.
- It must be the strike.
- The strike?
- They said there's a strike.
The strike ended a week ago.
Tell me when something happens.
l want a divorce.
l didn't want this.
l don't even know
how it started.
Who is she? Do l know her?
lt's Liz.
Here you go.
He told her he wants a divorce.
That's it? He told her?
He told her
he's sleeping with Liz?
- How did she take it?
- She's heartbroken.
She asked if it was because
they can't have children.
So she went to see Palomino?
lt makes sense.
You don't want her to beg.
Wait.
- Why did you change it?
- It's over. They're kissing.
Precisely! Put it back!
What are you doing?
You're eating chocolate
behind my back?
l don't want to tempt you.
Eat your chocolate normally!
What are you talking about?
l do it for you.
Put the extra large one here.
You think so?
- I'm not sure.
- The ones at your place?
lt's difficult to imagine.
These things are so ugly.
They sell like hot cakes.
- Amazing!
- No, it makes sense.
lt's decorative
and not disturbing.
People want
to continue to sleep.
- This young man, here.
- Hello.
- So you're taking over.
- You're the artist?
Yes, that's me.
lt was a success. Happy?
Very happy. I was lucky,
it went well.
But it's a good gallery,
lots of passers by.
- So you're a painter?
- Yes, so am l.
There's a trick
for the lighting.
- I can show you.
- No, it will be fine.
Shall we go? Good-bye.
l have my appointment
with ''Moustache.''
This guy is so thick.
You know what he did?
He wanted to tip me. He added
1 00 francs and said, ''lt's OK.''
l wanted to kill him.
Good-bye.
Like pissing cows.
Are you acting again soon?
What's the most difficult part?
The memorization?
l don't understand.
To depend on another's desire.
l would have seen it
a third time.
l can bring you the text.
Nice. I could read
all your parts--
That's it.
- You want some?
- Thank you.
Hi, Tomas.
I'm working Friday night.
lf you want. But 3:00 a.m.
isn't convenient.
No, it's not convenient.
What about tomorrow?
Yeah, noon is perfect.
OK, bye.
What were we saying?
Nothing. We weren't
saying anything.
What a surprise. How are you?
Of course, l can see you.
l have a green skirt
and a brown one.
Yeah.
l'll be here all day.
OK. No problem.
You want some?
l don't need that.
l don't either.
l want it, it's different.
Let's say l don't want it.
lf you want to marry me,
you'd better be nice.
I'm not nice?
Borderline.
You're very popular.
Thank you.
l prefer praline.
Have you seen her apartment?
lt's perfect.
- You can thank your brother.
- I did.
ls everything all right
with Angélique?
Yes. But l could have
done it alone.
lt's better this way.
lt helps you,
and she can practice a little.
She's a decorator,
and she never works.
Angélique does
very beautiful decorations.
Their home is perfect.
Hazelnut.
Why does he say
that it's like praline?
You must be happy, it came.
Hell if l was!
- You see, you were saying...
- I was wrong, l agree.
What time is it now?
We have plenty of time,
45 minutes.
l don't like to hurry.
The station is 400 yards away.
Clara. Miss Devaux!
Hi.
Let me introduce my father,
Mr. Castella...
and my sister, Beatrice.
She's teaching me English,
but she's a great actress.
- Actress? What's your name?
- You wouldn't know me.
- I'm in theater.
- I never go to the theater.
- What about television?
- No.
- Do you work with celebrities?
- You're bothering her.
No, but I'm in a hurry.
- See you Thursday?
- See you Thursday.
l didn't bother her, did l?
She doesn't seem like
an actress. Is she really?
Do you know a play
called ''Bérénice''?
- Yes, of course.
- I didn't.
So, how is she doing?
Fine, fine.
l'll finish it at home.
- Sorry. I'm bothering you.
- I prefer to read it at home.
Frank told me. ''You can kiss
her good-bye'', he said.
He knew something was wrong.
But I'm always so naive...
- I didn't even tell him.
- Excuse me.
Anyway, she doesn't say
it's over.
She doesn't.
But it's as if she did.
When you have sex with
someone else, it means...
What does it mean?
No, it's not the same.
lt's not the same for a man.
A man can have sex
with whomever.
lt doesn't mean anything.
l wasn't talking about you.
No, no, but l think
you're wrong.
For plenty of women, it doesn't
mean anything either.
Really?
- You just say that to be kind.
- No.
On the other hand, she could
have kept that to herself.
l don't see the point.
She does what she wants, but--
- How are you?
- Fine.
- And you?
- Fine.
Castella took so long tonight.
l thought he would keep me
until 2:00 a.m.
l'd like a beer. How about you?
- I should go.
- Have a drink with your pal.
l have to rest.
I'm picking her up at 8:00.
- Just one last one and...
- That's better.
- Are you OK?
- Yes.
- Fine.
- Good.
We had dates.
She wouldn't show up.
Then she was crying,
feeding me all kind of bullshit.
One day it was one thing,
the next day it was another.
l really tried hard.
l hung around for three years,
l tried to understand,
l forgave everything.
And each time
it was something new.
And l fell for it.
l was in love.
l got swindled for three years.
But...what's the connection
with Bruno?
He's kidding himself.
He's trusting.
Anyway, he's too trusting,
not only with women.
He trusts everybody,
he's too kind.
One day he's going to be really
disappointed, really hurt.
She wrote. So much the better.
- Who's that?
- That's...
That's a friend.
l'll be right back.
Hi. Hold on. I'll be right back.
Here you go. 500.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
I'm sorry. He couldn't
come at another time.
- Why the long face?
- What about it?
Should l burst into laughter
when you're selling this shit?
This shit?
- OK, I'm leaving.
- Really?
l'd bother your clients.
I'm not expecting anyone.
You're not bothering me.
Don't you want...
a cup of coffee? Yogurt?
l have some cookies,
if you want.
Are you upset? You're not happy.
No, I'm not happy.
Give me a break.
- You don't make a living?
- I have a normal job.
- So do l.
- You must be kidding.
A tobacco store,
that doesn't bother you?
- No, that doesn't bother me.
- Or a bar?
What do you mean?
Alcohol is legal,
so are cigarettes.
- What is this bullshit?
- Don't use that tone.
Are alcohol and cigarettes
legal or not?
Are alcohol and cigarettes
harmful or not?
lt's 1 0 times worse.
But you don't care.
Your problem
is that it's illegal.
Your arguments won't
help you in jail.
Why? You'll turn me in?
I'm out of here,
you're really...
l brought you the book.
- Did you read it?
- I couldn't.
l've read four pages,
the other ten pages.
Then l stopped.
They weren't very good.
l think they're wonderful.
Really? l don't--
You don't like them.
l know. Don't bother.
l have to push myself to read.
Then you will never read.
So what?
Yes, it's true.
l read your play three times.
You're only going to read that?
l also enjoyed the novel
you gave me afterwards.
lt's better here for
the classes, more pleasant.
He doesn't get bored
doing nothing?
That's his job.
- You can go.
- I'm waiting for a friend.
- We're going to the theater.
- You're going to the theater?
- Flowers, sir?
- No, no.
- Be nice.
- I told you no.
What a pain.
- That's no reason to...
- To what?
To be unpleasant.
He's selling flowers.
He's a human being.
- Sir.
- That's my friend!
- That's all right, Frank.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Who's that guy?
- Mr. Castella's bodyguard.
The bodyguard...
How funny.
- Mr. Castella, Mr. Reichner.
- A pleasure.
l hope he didn't frighten you.
He surprised me.
He says he doesn't mind--
lt's really not important.
You know that?
Of course, l know it.
What's that?
You don't understand things
that are obvious to me.
l only want to help you.
lt's not for money.
- You didn't want me to pay.
- I wasn't going to charge you.
l don't know what to say.
Every time l make a remark,
you get upset.
- You can't bear my opinion.
- No, that's not it.
lt's not because you interfere,
but each time,
your suggestions are...
- Are...
- Are what?
Can't you see?
Some things go together,
some don't.
You have to be consistent.
lf you want to keep
the pigs, keep them.
- What can l tell you?
- Mr. Castella called.
He said you shouldn't wait.
All right.
We'll talk about it, OK?
Let's go. We have
a million errands to run.
What time is it?
Oh, my goodness!
Flucky is coughing so much.
l don't know why, it must be
the pollution. It's awful.
And the little bird?
How is he doing, Mrs. Castella?
He's dead.
We should've gone to the vet.
Oh, please.
What a shitty play!
I'm appalled.
He has nothing to say.
Nothing to say?
Wait. He's the director--
You remember his Hamlet?
A piece of shit.
- I didn't see it.
- I know plenty of these idiots.
How can you work like that?
Did you read Dumont's article
when he destroyed him?
- The lmaginary lnvalid.
- Should be rendered invalid.
lsn't that your student
up there?
What's he doing here?
Stop! He'll come over.
He's really friendly.
Why shouldn't he come over?
You're not the one
he'll talk to.
I'm not up to it.
How are you?
lt was great, wasn't it?
l enjoyed it.
l couldn't stop laughing.
The one who plays the
lmaginary lnvalid is so funny.
- Is he that funny in real life?
- Yes, he is.
- Iet's eat something.
- Yes, let's go.
We're getting a bite.
l could come with you,
if you don't mind.
lt's only a bar.
You can eat, but--
That's perfect, perfect.
lt goes like this--
The evening is over.
They come back. The woman
goes into the bathroom.
The man goes to bed.
The woman washes up.
She puts on all her cold cream
for the night.
When she's finished,
she goes to bed,
they turn off the light,
and in the darkness,
after 3 seconds of silence,
the man says...
''Don't you think
it smells like shit?''
That's the best one yet.
lt's so subtle.
l preferred the one before,
the one about vomit.
lt was funny.
On that note,
l have one so funny--
Maybe we should stop now.
We're eating, and l've had
enough potty humor.
I'm sorry. You're right.
- Are you an actress?
- A wardrobe mistress.
But I'm unemployed
at the moment.
One is often unemployed
in this business.
That's what l tell myself
every morning.
lt's the same for you.
You don't work very much.
lt's sad not being able to work.
The jokes are over. Satisfied?
Yes, I'm thrilled.
Why don't you do a comedy?
That would be a good thing.
People want to take
their minds off things,
forget their troubles.
For example,
tonight it was full.
But last time it was half empty.
But, you know, l enjoyed it.
But, generally, that's what
people prefer--a funny play.
ln my opinion,
you should do a comedy.
You always play drama,
and then you wonder.
All right, I'm going to try it.
l'll do comedy.
l think he'll enjoy
your next show.
With lbsen, he'll die laughing.
- Who? With whom?
- Ibsen.
lbsen is funny.
Very funny, he's a kind
of Norwegian comic.
Another very funny one
is Strindberg.
l prefer lbsen.
He's the funniest.
When Nora leaves Elmer
at the end of A Doll's House...
We're just joking.
lbsen really isn't funny.
That's enough, now.
Did l tell you the latest one
about Valerie?
- Aren't you bored?
- I'm OK. I'm just watching.
- Who's that guy at the bar?
- A customer.
- Want a drink?
- My boss needs you.
Shit! You scared me.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
Watching you sleep.
And was it interesting?
lt was nice.
You were talking.
Really?
What was l saying?
You were saying,
''Mommy, Mommy...I'm scared.''
- I don't believe you.
- I'm kidding.
You were saying,
''The chick hasn't been born
who'll get me.''
That's more likely.
You were very nice with
your customer earlier.
lt's good for business.
You don't make
your living in that bar.
Why do you say that?
No reason.
l work two or three nights.
l don't make much.
That's why you're a dealer.
True. I don't do it for fun.
- Do you sell powder, too?
- Grass and hash.
You're giving me a lecture?
You sound like my father.
Fathers sometimes
speak the truth.
Not mine.
Your boss is a good guy.
He doesn't seem mean.
He's dense.
They made fun of him all night.
He didn't even realize it.
But he isn't mean.
Why ''poor guy''? He put himself
in this situation.
He comes, it's one stupid thing
after another, and in the end...
he picks up the tab.
- It's not my fault.
- OK, OK.
lt's the truth.
- When will you have some hash?
- I can't reach my guy.
l'll try someone else.
l'll have to stop sometime.
l can't do this all my life.
What else would you like to do?
Have children.
Tend to my home, cook.
lt's tempting.
Where is Schafter?
Schafter? She didn't come.
She has other fish to fry.
- And Orvitz?
- He won't come.
- You don't know that.
- Are you kidding?
He doesn't show for paintings.
- Where does he go, then?
- Conceptual Art.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Paintings are outdated for them.
l saw Zaramba earlier.
Yes, he came because of Oraki.
Anyway, it's crowded.
l heard good things.
- Hi, Valerie.
- Hi.
Look, lsabelle and Cécile.
You OK? Need some help?
- I'm OK. You want something?
- How about a little white wine?
A little bit for me, also.
I'm glad that l invited him.
- Has he seen you?
- No, not yet.
He's seen me now.
What are you doing here?
He told me to stop by. Hi.
Hi. How are you?
lt's wine.
ln French, in French.
lt's so crowded!
ls he a well-known painter?
Ah, Mr. Castella.
How do you like it?
l haven't looked yet.
Who is he? Do you know him?
He's good-looking.
l don't like mustaches, anyway.
Good afternoon. Congratulations.
l haven't looked yet,
but it's crowded.
l didn't know this city
had so many people.
Are you happy?
He's not happy?
He is, but a lot of journalists
didn't show up.
They said they were coming
and didn't?
What a bunch of fags.
Fags? What do you mean?
You know, fags.
You mean ass-fuckers
like my friends and l?
Antoine, you want something?
What about you, Benoit?
lf you want to marry me,
you'd better be nice.
Yeah.
OK. See you tonight. Bye.
- You're getting married?
- No. It's an inside joke.
- Did Manie tell you?
- What?
About my...
my girlfriend?
Well, what is it?
You were right.
She's seeing someone.
- Shit.
- You were right.
- You knew it, unlike others...
- That's too bad.
Yep.
- She doesn't say it's over.
- Of course not.
When l told Manie,
she told me that a woman could
have sex with a guy without...
- Just like us.
- Really, Manie said that?
Manie says what she wants.
l think she's taking
advantage of you.
You're in a weird situation.
l know it all too well.
- Good-bye.
- Say hi to Louis.
I'm sorry for
what l said earlier.
Did l upset you?
- You didn't find it appalling?
- It's not important.
lt's just a figure of speech.
l spoke without thinking.
Yes, that's the problem.
l bought a painting.
The one in the corner.
The little...
Why are you smiling?
- You didn't have to.
- That's not it.
l like it,
that's why l bought it.
l looked at them all,
and l liked that one.
Hi.
So, where were we?
You were supposed
to write a few lines?
l have it here.
Oh, a poem...good.
Yes. Should l start over?
You're progressing.
- I checked a dictionary.
- Good.
A few mistakes, but...
You understood?
- Whom I'm talking about.
- Yes, l think so.
Yes, l understood.
Should we correct it or go back
to the irregular verbs?
Dunno.
I'm sorry.
There's nothing l can say.
You write me a poem,
it's very sweet,
but, unfortunately...
l don't share your feelings,
so we should move on,
you understand?
- You understand?
- Yes.
Would you mind
if we stopped now?
l'd prefer it.
Are you going to stay here long?
Dunno.
lt's getting chilly.
What is it?
Did you notice anything?
What do you mean?
l shaved my mustache.
Oh, yes, it's true.
l hadn't noticed.
l didn't see that
you shaved your mustache.
Nobody does.
- How's it going?
- They're gone.
They waited until 5:30 and left.
''They'' who?
- Oh, the lranians.
- Yes, the lranians!
l rescheduled for
the same time tomorrow.
- You treat people like dirt!
- OK, OK.
We've worked on this contract
for a month!
Contract aside, you're absent
even when you're here.
We can't work like this.
Everything bores you except
for your English classes.
Mr. Castella, every one
must take responsibility.
l can't do it all.
l've had it up to here with you!
Don't use that tone with me.
You think you're a hotshot
with your diplomas.
That's enough!
l'll be on time tomorrow!
You have anything else to say?
So...when do we get married?
Whenever you want.
When my contract is over, then.
OK.
- I'm kidding, you know.
- Me too.
After that, we go on vacation.
A little honeymoon.
Yes, of course.
A little honeymoon.
Then you move in here.
- No, no. You'll follow me.
- Where?
- It depends. Here and there.
- Really?
What do l do while you work?
Take care of the house,
the kids, the cooking?
ls it so degrading?
You do it then.
l'll work.
You take care of the house.
lt's not degrading.
No one can order you around.
Why do you say that?
- Nobody steps on your toes.
- Should l let them?
No, you're right.
Don't let them.
But you seem
to think the opposite.
When will you be done?
ln a week or 1 0 days.
When they sign.
I'm going to make some pasta.
Think about my proposal
for the plant.
Good-bye.
Thank you. Good-bye.
You're already home?
You shouldn't drink, honey.
Alcohol is sugar.
Who put that there?
- What's that thing?
- It's a painting.
l just bought it.
You bought that? But, why?
l like it. I find it nice.
lt's awful. You won't
leave that here, l hope.
Angélique...
l like that painting.
l can't get used to your face.
You look so weird.
Why don't you sit down?
But what's going on?
What's the matter?
Aren't you well?
- But, why?
- I don't know.
- You want a cookie?
- No.
I'm sorry. Did he hurt you?
- It's OK.
- He just nipped you, right?
lt's funny that
you never got along.
l didn't know l had to
befriend a dog...
in order not to be bitten.
Do you like animals?
l like people better.
You don't think animals
have a heart?
l just said l prefer people.
l don't always.
Well...
- The fabrics are really nice.
- Very nice.
- So you're happy?
- Very.
- You won't need me to--?
- No, it's fine, l assure you.
OK...
- What did she say?
- She wants to settle there.
Now it's really over.
- What a stupid letter l sent.
- What letter?
l wrote her a letter saying...
''I'm not mad. Don't worry,
it happens to everyone.''
- What's wrong with that?
- It was stupid! She used me.
I'm so naive. Moreno was right.
Forget tonight. Castella
is making me work overtime.
He wants to go out.
Something new.
- 1 8 X 9.
- That's big.
The front wall.
He already did a few sketches.
He has two or three
very good ideas.
- Hi.
- You can come to the studio.
We can bring them to the plant.
You decide.
- What do you prefer?
- I don't know.
- We can come to the plant.
- OK.
Cécile?
Sorry, Clara, but...
What would be good
about the corrugated iron...
l waited for you, Mr. Castella.
Really? l...I'm overworked
right now, and...
l can't take classes anymore.
- You could have told me.
- I forgot.
l have too much work.
l'll pay you what l owe.
Why are you stopping?
lt's a shame.
Why is it a shame?
Because you were progressing.
Want to see the menu?
No, thank you. I have to go.
What are you doing?
- I'd like to walk by myself.
- Don't.
No, it's OK.
We can't leave you
alone in the streets.
You start like this,
you end up a doormat.
- That's absurd.
- He'll hold it against you.
The moment always comes.
l should keep my mouth
shut, obviously.
- Things would go much better.
- Then he's an idiot.
Don't do that,
just be more diplomatic.
She won't change.
He must be mature.
I'm always at his throat.
She's right.
l should let go of a few things,
ignore them sometimes.
But he's so conservative
that l can't help myself.
And l can't refrain
from seeing him, so...
Why do l always fall
for that type?
lt's so complex, shit!
- You cleaned up, Manie?
- Yeah.
What are you doing now?
Nothing special.
How about a drink
somewhere else?
OK.
See you tomorrow.
Bye, Valerie.
That girl over there isn't bad.
Go tell her that
l'll buy her a drink.
- She doesn't want it.
- Why not?
She didn't say.
lt depends if you'd rather
have a metallic panel...
above the entrance, for example.
The entire surface,
I'm not sure...
What I'm not sure about is if
l want to have it glued on.
l don't know if you want to have
it just above the entrance,
or if you want just this part...
l don't want the entire front...
l'd like it large,
as you mentioned.
OK.
24 francs, please.
- I'll take this.
- 31 .50.
lt's true. But l don't think
they're all like that.
You're kidding.
They're all very nice,
they promise the moon,
but in the end, these assholes
just think about their money.
- The rest just sells papers.
- What do you do?
- What do you mean?
- What do you do?
You sit back
and spectate, it's easy.
You abandon everything,
then you criticize.
Change the world,
since you're so pure.
l'll get it.
- Yes?
- Is Manie in?
Nobody's home.
You know what time it is?
- She told me to stop by.
- She made a mistake.
What were you saying?
Where is it?
- What?
- The painting. Did you move it?
lt didn't look good.
l'll put it somewhere else.
Where?
l don't know.
l'll think about it.
Listen. That painting
is...very odd.
- Iet me watch my show, honey.
- I like it.
- Could l watch this?
- Why did you remove it?
l didn't like it.
- It doesn't go.
- I don't care!
l didn't choose one thing
in this house.
For once l like something,
and l can't have it?
Do you think I'm happy
in this candy dish?
l can't stand these pink walls
and these birdies any longer.
Where's Moreno? He's not home.
Let's try at Manie's.
He should be there.
Manie? Who's she?
l'll smash his face in, OK?
How are you?
Fuck! It's every night now.
Yeah. But he's not well.
Stop!
- Are you OK, Mr. Castella?
- Yeah.
Yeah?
They broke in
and took everything.
- Does it sting?
- Not at all.
Didn't you have
a mustache before?
Yes. Finally.
Nobody's noticed.
Except my wife...
who thinks that l look weird.
No, l like it.
ls Clara a friend of yours?
She didn't notice.
She told you
l made a fool of myself?
When? Oh, yes, the other night,
having dinner at the bar.
l made a fool of myself then?
No, l thought...l don't know.
What happened?
- My...my declaration.
- Of what?
l...l...
- She didn't tell you?
- She didn't say a thing.
- A declaration of...
- Pardon?
l wrote her a...
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah.
lt's OK. It will go away.
l hope so.
Excuse me. I've got to go.
- You're leaving now?
- Yes.
- Could you tell Maité?
- Yes. I'll leave this here.
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.
Blue is very nice here.
Very nice...because blue is...
- This is the one l really want.
- OK.
Yes, Mrs. Rousset,
our Head of PR,
thinks so also, and...
Sylvie, come see a second.
We won't tell her a thing.
Sit down, please.
- Do we agree on this one?
- Yes, this is much brighter.
- Truly.
- Yes, yes, truly.
- Have you been waiting long?
- Just 5 minutes.
l was with Castella.
lt took longer than expected.
You're always with Castella.
What are you doing with him?
We have a project together.
We need to discuss things.
You found a gold mine.
That's nice.
Mostly for Benoit. He won't
have to worry for a while.
That doesn't bother you?
Not at all.
Why should l be bothered?
Perhaps l have
too many scruples.
And l don't?
You're taking advantage of him.
lt makes me uneasy.
Absolutely not.
What are you talking about?
He enjoys Benoit's work
and wants a fresco.
- Where's the problem?
- Antoine, you know what l mean.
Don't tell me that
Castella enjoys Benoit's work.
Castella doesn't know anything.
He's spending his money,
and you make him believe
that you're friends.
l don't make him believe that.
I'm cordial, that's all.
He doesn't know anything,
but he likes his painting.
What can l do?
Why am l on trial here?
- Was the fresco his idea?
- No, but...
- I want some coffee. And you?
- Coffee.
How are you?
Guess who was in my bathroom
for an hour yesterday.
- Castella.
- Of course.
- Why ''of course''?
- No reason.
We talked about him.
lt was interesting.
l was touched.
What was he doing
in your bathroom?
You're not doing well,
Mr. Castella.
Neither am l.
I'm not well either.
Really?
lt's tough.
- Want to talk about it?
- No.
No, l'd rather not.
Yes, sir.
- Are you OK?
- I was thinking.
We sign in two days.
- Very good.
- Yes, it's good.
- So you'll be finished here.
- That's what we decided.
Good.
lt must have been
very boring for you.
lt was Weber's decision,
because of the insurance.
lt wasn't really necessary.
Except the other night,
but you weren't there.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Castella.
- No, don't worry about it.
l could get mugged
all year round.
But thank you.
You haven't slept much
because of me.
- I'll give you a bonus.
- It was my job.
Besides, it's not
the first time--
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Could l talk to you?
- Yes.
- Pardon me.
- Sure.
- Want to sit down?
- No, thank you.
l don't have an appointment.
lt won't take long.
But something is bothering me.
l feel like it's...
my fault.
l know that you intend
to purchase...
an expensive painting,
a fresco for your entrance.
lt's none of my business,
but since l introduced you
to these people, l...
I'm uneasy. I feel responsible.
To be plain, l feel like
you're...let's say...
you're being taken advantage of.
l talked to Antoine.
Even if he says the opposite,
l really think...
he's taking advantage...
of your feelings for me.
I'm not sure l understand.
Why do you say that
he's taking advantage of me?
l like these paintings,
and l buy them, that's all.
What's the problem?
All right, then.
ls that why you came here?
Yes.
And why did you think
l was buying them?
You thought it was
to please you? ls that it?
To make a good impression?
l don't know. Maybe.
You didn't imagine for a minute
that l could...like them?
ls that what you think of me?
Don't worry. I like them.
Believe it or not,
it's not to win you over.
Your liking me is not even
conceivable, l understood that.
lt's the kind of thing
that even l can understand.
- See you Monday.
- Remember, 1 0:00 a.m. sharp.
- Don't worry. I'll be there.
- Oh, here.
l wanted to give you
my letter of resignation.
Really?
- You want to leave?
- Yes.
I'm not a good match for you.
l thought about it thoroughly
and didn't find a solution.
l don't think the situation will
change, in spite of my efforts.
You decided from the start that
l don't belong to your world.
You say l talk like
a government official.
lt's true, it's my background.
That's how l was educated.
l tried to change.
l did all l could to please you.
But let's face it...l failed.
So...l think it would be better
for me to leave.
Well...see you Monday.
Weber.
That doesn't suit me very well.
- Would you think about it?
- I did.
- That's why l talked to you.
- It's too bad, because...
l was mistaken.
l thought you despised me.
I'm sorry if l hurt you.
l didn't mean to.
You don't want to
think about it...
before making your decision?
- He's staying at a hotel?
- No, at the plant.
Flucky is happy.
He doesn't understand
nastiness or hypocrisy.
He's content running everywhere.
He's happy.
He doesn't bother a soul
or know how ugly the world is.
The world is what it is.
We deal with it.
l don't want to.
lt's too disgusting, too awful.
I'm not interested.
You should move to Disneyland.
The former Minister,
Nicolas Sauvageon,
is in police custody.
With us is lnspector Turtle,
who made the arrest.
Turn that off.
- Wait just a second.
- Please, Bruno, turn that off.
He was a member of
the government from 1 995--
- Thank you, Mr. Castella.
- Good-bye, thank you.
So...
- Not going to say good-bye?
- Are you kidding?
- Good-byes are stupid.
- Yeah, they're a pain.
l wanted to ask you,
what was the name of the guy...
you could never--
Wasn't his name Sauvageon?
You haven't read the paper?
Look.
lt's your buddy Turtle
who arrested him.
A good guy.
He was right to stay.
Yeah.
OK. So long, Bruno.
Take care of yourself.
- Yeah, you too, Frank.
- OK.
Bye.
Hi, Camille. How are you?
Who's here, Camille?
lt's Angélique.
Come in.
- He left me.
- Yes, l know.
- You know?
- He came by the other night.
Really?
You're seeing each other again?
- You changed everything.
- No.
- Just a little bit.
- It's nice like this.
How is it? Not too tight?
Provided l don't breathe.
- And now?
- Now it's fine.
Antoine--he's picking me up.
Want to have dinner with us?
No. I'm seeing Fred tonight.
lt's strange, you know,
l would have never guessed it.
We had nothing in common.
lt's incredible how
we can misjudge people.
l could have missed him.
- Are you sure it's OK?
- Yes, it fits.
l knew it was going
to finish late.
We came home
at 5:00 a.m., smashed.
l slept 2 hours maximum.
l have a headache.
Do you know
if Castella is coming?
- Castella? Where to?
- To the opening.
- How would l know?
- You could have talked.
No, l didn't say a thing.
We're not going to have him
on our backs all the time.
Why? You were afraid
that l invited him?
l invited him.
So, you saw her?
Yes, she's coming.
You must stay, Mr. Iaforgues,
or she'll have to leave alone.
True. Thank you very much,
Madame. I will therefore stay.
Very well.
l will talk to the maid.
Elliot, this matter,
this question about the future,
will it be the subject
of your lecture?
Yes, that is what l heard
at the bookstore.
You would give a series
of lectures.
Yes. Don't hold it against me.
Of course, l understand
that it upsets you.
lt's not good for her
to see us doing this.
Madame Estelle,
you'll live at Aunt Julie's.
l'll come every night.
We'll work there.
She shot herself in the head.
Can you imagine?
Lord have mercy.
This isn't a proper thing to do.
Here we go.
We cut on the third at the end.
The third time.
Sharp.
