And ready, here we go.
Five, four, three, two--
Good evening. Tragedy in Taiwan.
Disaster in Denmark.
Mayhem in Malaysia.
Those stories and more coming up later.
Tonight's lead story:
the computer game phenomenon. . .
. . .distributed by alleged Russian
Mafia leader Konstantine Konali. . .
. . .has taken the world by storm.
Out of the cold climates of Russia. . .
. . .comes the hottest
computer game sensation. . .
. . .simply called ''The Game. '' Ed?
-Ed, what are you doing?
-You gotta try this game. lt's great.
Not now, Ed.
ln the past six months. . .
. . . ''The Game'' has generated
over $ 1 .5 billion in revenue. . .
-. . .breaking all previous records.
-Get him, you miserable bear!
What makes this game stand out?
This is the first time that a video game. . .
. . .has appealed to a youthful. . .
-Ed!
. . .as well as a more sophisticated market.
-Oh, sh--
-''The Game,'' available in cartridges. . .
. . .as well as floppy disks for computer,
has everybody playing.
Take it, Lindsay, take it.
The creator and mass-marketer
of ''The Game'' is Konstantine Konali. . .
-. . .allegedly head of the Russian Mafia.
-No, no, no!
Konali and--
What is he up to in Moscow?
Get your hands off it.
-Get your hands off the game!
-l want that game!
l'm not giving you my game!
Give it to me!
ED: You're through at this station.
LlNDSAY: You're through.
Misha, take care of Skippy.
Ay.
Leonid, Leonid, Leonid.
Enough living in the shadows.
Someday. . .
. . .this will all. . .
. . .be mine!
MAN 1 : This crime problem is out of hand.
MAN 2: Yes, Boris Nikolayevich.
BORlS:
We need help.
MAN: I can recommend a man I met
during the international conference.
I understand he has already
had dealings with Konali...
... when Konali was in America.
l will make this very clear.
Can he help us get Konali?
Yes, Boris Nikolayevich.
He is just the man for the job.
Keep me informed.
Ah.
[CHEERlNG ]
Oh.
There you are, son.
How are the new recruits doing?
lt might be the best class ever,
except for one man.
-He's afraid of heights.
-See what you can do for him.
l find that sometimes the least likely
cadets make the finest police officers.
Commandant Lassard, throw us the ball.
Off the scoreboard. . .
. . .off the floor, off the wall. . .
. . .off the redhead.
Nothing but net.
-Not bad.
-l love this game.
Connors. Where's Connors?
WOMAN:
Thanks, Connors. You fixed it.
That's a classified police file.
''The academy has assembled a special
team for a mission to Moscow. ''
l'd kill for that job.
CONNORS:
Webster's on the list. Why him?
Because he graduated first in our class.
Yeah, well. . .
. . .can he do this?
Yep.
Can he do this?
-Yep.
-That's all l got.
WOMAN:
What are you doing?
-Well, l've never been to Russia.
-Okay, now put it back.
Connors. Sergeant wants you.
-Yeah.
MAN: Now.
l'm so very, very glad to see you.
The Moscow police
have asked us to assist them. . .
-. . .in apprehending Konstantine Konali.
MAN: Russkies?
LASSARD: The godfather of Russian
organized crime.
Men. . . .
Six years ago. . .
. . .Konali helped to establish a branch
of the Russian Mafia here. . .
. . .in our country.
Nearly got him then.
Unfortunately, he slipped through our
fingers and escaped back to Moscow...
... where he continues
his criminal activities...
...aided by his brother Mikhail
and pet snake Skippy.
[TUNlNG RADlO]
SPORTSCASTER:
Home run!
Now we get another chance
to apprehend him.
[SlZZLlNG ]
CADET 1 :
Man, what a wimp.
[BLOWS WHlSTLE]
Connors, get down here.
You're never gonna pass the test.
l've gotta pass. My father was a cop.
His father was a cop.
His father was a horse thief.
-You got vertigo. Let's go.
-Vertigo. Ha!
l don't have vertigo.
CADET 2:
Yo, Connors, you want a doughnut?
CADET 3: Not bad.
COACH: Connors, let's face it.
You don't have what it takes
to be a cop.
Take this to Commandant
Lassard's office.
-He'll sign off on your dismissal papers.
CADET 4: Bummer, dude.
Now, l want you to meet. . .
[KNOCKlNG ]
. . .a new addition to our team.
-You must be Cadet Connors.
-Hi.
l'm very, very impressed by your file.
-Cadet Kyle Connors.
-Mm.
LASSARD:
Top grade average in the class.
CONNORS:
Sir, I have to tell you something.
Congratulations.
Thanks, but l'm not really the man
in that file.
Oh, l know what you mean.
These reports never do give
an accurate picture of who we really are.
-Hm?
-Yes, but--
CONNORS:
Ow!
Ooh!
What the hell is this?
Uh-huh.
Come on, come on. Come on.
-Let's all pull together.
WOMAN: Okay.
Okay, all together, on three!
One, two, three!
MAN: Oh, God.
-Sir!
Ah! Captain Harris, our expert in
surveillance, will be accompanying us.
Team, we're all off to Russia. . .
. . .to kick many, many butt-skis.
[SPEAKS lN RUSSlAN]
Ah, Alexander Nikolaivitch.
[CLEARS THROAT]
Men. . .
. . .this is the honorable Commandant
Alexander Nikolaivitch Rakov.
-Sasha.
-May l say it is an honor. . .
. . .to have the great Commandant
Lassard visiting our country?
-Yes, you may.
-May l kiss you again?
-No, you may not.
-May l escort you inside?
Yes, you may.
lt is really wonderful
to have you here in Russia.
Please say hello to your lovely wife. . .
. . .and tell her l'm sorry
she's not here with you.
[CLEARS THROAT]
Yes. Lieutenant Yuri Talinsky.
Head of our organized crime unit.
Please, don't underestimate
the power of the Russian Mafia. . .
. . .the most sadistic organization
in the world.
Katya.
This is Sergeant Katya Sergei.
She has been handpicked
to be your guide and translator.
Lieutenant Talinsky,
l hold you personally responsible. . .
. . .for the comfort and safety of the
Americans and Commandant Lassard.
-Yes, sir.
-Now, Americans and Russians. . .
. . .we must grab Konali
like the insect that he is. . .
. . .and we must then crush him!
-God.
HARRlS: Make way. Jones. Jones.
-Jones. Make way. Make way.
-Oh!
l am Captain Thaddeus Harris
and in this case. . .
. . .l have state-of-the-art
American surveillance equipment.
l'll have this Konali business
wrapped up for you in a few days.
Excuse me, Ricky.
l must go to the toilet.
Yes, of course.
-Pardon me. Which is my car?
-The one in front.
The one in front. Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKlNG lN RUSSlAN]
-What did he say?
-Well, he said that you had. . .
. . .a marvelous attitude and you're
a pleasure to work with, sir.
l'm going to keep my eye on you.
[SPEAKS lNDlSTlNCTLY]
WOMAN OVER lNTERCOM: The red zone
is for Communist parking only.
The one in front.
WOMAN OVER lNTERCOM: The red zone
is for Communist parking only.
Oh, hello.
Lieutenant Talinsky didn't
tell me his family would be here.
Very nice of you to come and greet me.
Katrina, l want you to think of me
as America's goodwill ambassador.
And you think of me
as translator and guide.
[SOBBlNG ]
Stop! Stop!
Ay! Ay-yai-yai-yai-yai.
l'm in deep borscht.
[SPEAKlNG lN RUSSlAN]
Captain Callahan, 51 1 .
Sergeant Jones, 51 3.
Sergeant Tackleberry, 51 4.
Cadet Connors, 520.
Captain Harris, 51 5.
Not exactly a four-star hotel, is it?
Well, we spend our police budget
on fighting criminals. . .
. . .not on pampering
out-of-town visitors.
Your government brought us here.
They also bring in monkeys for zoo. . .
. . .but we don't put them
in four-star hotel either.
Well, l just go check
on Commandant Lassard.
Lassard. Lassard. You!
[SCREAMS]
You.
-Hm-mm.
-You.
[SPEAKS lNDlSTlNCTLY]
l have job for you.
Again. When you hear door,
you say:
''l'm in the bathroom.
l'll meet you there. ''
''l'm in the bathroom. Meet me there. ''
Again.
''l'm in the bathroom.
l'll meet you there. ''
''l'm in the bathroom.
Meet you there. ''
[KNOCKS]
Come in.
Again!
BELL HOP:
''ln the bathroom. Meet me there. ''
Excuse me.
ls the commandant in?
Well, l just saw him. He's very tired
and enjoying moment of rest.
Ah. Thank you.
[SPEAKS lN RUSSlAN]
l have to get to next level. Eh. . . .
-Looking for something, captain?
-Bugs. You can never be too careful.
-Call me paranoid.
-You're paranoid.
l'm down to one life. l can't make it.
Can l show you a little trick?
Watch. You just want the bear
to go back three spaces. Right?
See?
lt makes it to next level.
-l made it. Thank you.
-Game.
RAKOV:
Good morning, everyone.
l understand that your commandant
will not be joining us today.
However, we will proceed
with briefing anyway.
Konstantine Konali,
Russian Mafia godfather.
[lMlTATlNG CHALK SQUEAKlNG ]
Jones!
His brother and second-in-command,
Mikhail Konali.
[lMlTATlNG CHALK SQUEAKlNG ]
[GROWLS]
Konstantine Konali is involved
in extortion. . .
. . .gambling, fencing jewelry,
arms dealing.
But he does not choose
to involve himself. . .
[JONES MAKlNG
FARTlNG SOUNDS]
JONES: Too much cabbage.
-. . .in day-to-day running of operations. . .
. . .which makes it rather difficult
to catch him. However. . .
. . .we know three places
that he frequents regularly.
One: his restaurant. . .
. . .where he conducts meetings
in back of office.
Two: his dacha. And three:
Hello. Hello.
His warehouse, where he conducts
legitimate video games business. Now. . .
[BELCHES]
. . .we believe Konali
is up to something big.
Unfortunately, attempts
to infiltrate his operations have failed. . .
. . .but we will now work together
and we will capture Konali.
-Excuse me.
MALE VOlCE: Ow!
Adam.
So good to see you.
Thank you for inviting me, Mr. Konali.
However, your delivery service. . .
. . .leaves a little bit to be desired.
l have the perfect plan,
but l need your help.
-My help?
-l want you to design a program. . .
. . .that will bypass any computer
security system in the world. . .
. . .letting me have access to secret files.
You're talking about. . .
-. . .a passkey?
-Bingo.
-Nothing like this exists.
-Create it.
l want to be able to tap
into the world's banks. . .
. . .manipulate the world's stock markets,
know what heads of countries know.
We could control the world!
Louder, Misha. l don't think
all of Moscow heard you.
Even if l did create this passkey,
how will you get it into their computers?
l have already thought of that.
You, my dear Adam, will design
a new version of ''The Game. ''
We will call it. . .
. . . ''The New Game. ''
And we will put the passkey in it.
When you slip it into your computer,
bada-bing!
l will have access to impenetrable files.
Pretty good, no?
Lassard.
Bah! Yankee police.
Ow!
Boys, watch them.
l want to know their every move.
Good luck, babushka.
Uh. . . .
''ln the bathroom. Meet you there.
ln the--
ln the bathroom. '' Yes.
TACKLEBERRY:
Sir, we have to go now.
-Sir?
-ln the bathroom.
-Meet you there.
-ls everything okay?
The commandant is having
some problems adjusting.
-He's gonna meet us there.
-Oh.
Whew!
LASSARD: You know, in America,
funerals are in English.
This where you live?
Good day.
[SPEAKlNG lN RUSSlAN]
l have a fish.
[SPEAKS lN RUSSlAN]
He lives in a bowl too.
You have a lovely, lovely apartment.
Somehow, l feel quite at home here.
HARRlS: A Russki police academy.
What a joke.
ln Lassard's absence,
l will do all the talking.
You'll say nothing, do nothing,
watch your every move.
Be on your toes.
Any false move could embarrass us all.
And don't trust these guys.
Just because we're buddy-buddy
with them now. . .
. . .don't forget they
were our sworn enemies just--
Just a little while ago.
-Move it. Move it, move it.
MAN: Moron.
The topic for today is police field tactics.
The Russian and the American approach.
American police. Good.
Perhaps you can tell us
about apprehending criminals.
-Me?
-You. You.
[APPLAUSE]
Goodness' sakes.
-Major.
-Sergeant.
Class, this is Sergeant Tackleberry.
Okay. You know, as cops--
l don't have to tell you this.
lt's tough to uphold the law,
but in the States. . .
. . .we have to deal with constantly
changing police regulations.
l mean, take for example
the excessive force issue.
-l could use a volunteer.
-Tackleberry, what are you doing?
l am in charge here.
Captain Harris,
perhaps you should demonstrate.
-Well, that's more like it.
-Back in the old days. . .
. . .there wasn't anything you couldn't do
trying to apprehend a perpetrator.
Take for example
the highly effective chokehold.
Tackleberry!
Well, nowadays this is considered
to be excessive force.
Or. . .
. . .the ever-dependable,
always reliable PK-24 police baton. . .
. . .which, with a single blow
to the body. . .
. . .say to the lower thigh. . . .
Renders a subject
completely incapacitated.
But, no, no.
Nowadays this too is considered
to be excessive force.
They want me to uphold the law. . .
. . .but they tie my hands.
Fortunately. . .
. . .there's always Old Reliable.
Why mess with success?
Uh, thanks.
[GUN FlRES]
Have you seen Lassard?
[SPEAKS lN RUSSlAN]
l have had it with you losers.
l will capture Konali
because l use my head.
TACKLEBERRY: Yeah, right.
CALLAHAN: Think we can lose him?
Excuse me.
ls possible you help me?
Sure. Uh. . . .
Why don't you guys run along
and l'll catch up with you later.
Uh-huh. Sure.
Katrina, how can l help you?
You ever want something
so badly it hurts?
-Yes.
-And no matter how much you wait. . .
. . .and hope and wait more,
you don't get what you want?
Well, yeah.
But my advice is don't give up.
Just go for it.
-l want--
-Thattagirl. Follow your heart.
-l want--
-Say it.
-l want my vacation.
-What's that?
l wait three years. Three years.
Then you Americans come.
Talinsky, he assign me to you.
-Mm-hm.
-Now l can't go.
l have plan.
Connors, l don't leave you. . .
. . .without anyone.
Come. l select suitable replacement
for you.
She's best in department.
Yeah, l'm sure she is.
Look, all l know is Lassard
disappear at airport.
Organize search, find Lassard,
but keep quiet.
-What are you doing here?
-Just browsing.
Ah.
Hey, Yuri, that translator, Katrina?
Very good. She's excellent.
All our people are excellent.
For instance, this is lrina Petrovskaya.
She is expert in forensics.
She can tell you everything
about person. . .
. . .just by looking at one hair from head.
Ow!
Hmm. My observations conclude
this man is picky eater. . .
. . .afraid of heights. . .
-. . .and still a virgin.
CONNORS: What?
l'm not a picky eater.
Cadet Connors is also a forensics expert.
Maybe you'd be so generous
as to share with us your expertise.
-Uh, sure.
-This one puzzles us.
We were able to remove only one
fingerprint from scene of crime.
This is our only clue. . .
. . .to identity of criminal.
Okey-dokey.
[SCREAMS]
No wonder you're puzzled.
This glass is all cracked.
Enough!
Next assignment, Chernobyl.
Excuse me, lieutenant. . .
. . .but the chief said you and your men
would be available to us.
Absolutely, Captain Callahan,
and l have just the men for you.
[SHOUTlNG lN RUSSlAN]
CONNORS:
These guys are cops?
You get the feeling that
we're not wanted here?
l'll tell you what we need to do.
-We need to let Konali know we're here.
-On his turf.
-Hit him where it hurts.
TACKLEBERRY: l like that.
-Get in his face.
-Kick some butt.
TACKLEBERRY:
Better get Katrina.
Hey, bud. Nice work.
lt would be a shame
to see this all go up in smoke.
-How do you mean?
-Accidents happen.
Fire breaks out,
beam gives way, workers--
Get out.
Tell Konali l won't pay
his extortion money.
Hey, buddy. Commandant Lassard
sends his regards.
l can't tell you how it makes me feel. . .
. . .to be received so very, very
generously into your family.
[SPEAKlNG lN RUSSlAN]
[COUGHS]
[SPEAKlNG lN RUSSlAN]
Oh.
[WHlSTLlNG ]
HARRlS:
l'll take matters into my own hands.
MAN:
What is he doing?
-Sir, would you like to have lunch?
-Meet me in the bedroom.
ln the bathroom.
-Sir?
BELL HOP: Meet me there!
Meet you there! Meet you there!
This sewer stinks.
So Americans leave
without saying goodbye.
Russians say goodbye
without leaving.
Oh, allow me.
[WOMAN SPEAKlNG lN RUSSlAN]
[SlNGlNG ''HOME ON THE RANGE'']
Ooh!
This went rancid.
[CONTlNUlNG SlNGlNG ]
TACKLEBERRY:
l promise you this:
After today, Konali's gonna know
this cop's in town.
KATRlNA:
This is a typical Russian bathhouse.
[MAN YELLS]
Okay. So this is Konali's sauna.
lt's just a front. People come here
to fence stolen jewels.
All right. Let's get naked.
Come on. Come on.
[WOMEN SPEAKlNG lN RUSSlAN]
Hello, ladies.
[SCREAMlNG ]
Hi.
Nice place you got here.
[WHlPS CRACKlNG ]
[MEN YELLlNG ]

You may resume. . .
. . .whatever it is you were doing.
[SPEAKlNG lN RUSSlAN]
Okay, okay. l should be

[WOMAN LAUGHlNG ]
-Did you like the necklace?
WOMAN: Oh, yes, my pushki.
-How much?
-In fact, it is all that I am wearing.
I decided that from now on...
...I will only wear diamonds,
diamonds and diamonds.
-Yes.
-Really?
KONALl: l'm going to see you later, right?
WOMAN: Oh, I hope so.
KONALl:
l'm going to bring you big surprise.
-What?
-How about Big Skippy?
-I love Big Skippy.
-And Little Skippy.
WOMAN:
No, not the little one.
-He bothers me.
-All right. l call you later.
HARRlS:
Hey, move it. Down in front.
Mr. Konali, we've got bad news.
lt's American police.
They're messing
with our operation again.
No more. You hear me?
As of this moment l am putting
a contract out on Lassard and his team!
We squash them!
My fish, Swimmy Lassard.
He eats at this time every day.
MAN:
This will be fun, Vlady.
[SPEAKlNG lN RUSSlAN]
Hey, you little punk, get lost!
Hey, spread out!
-You okay?
-Yeah.
Listen, just because they're good on bikes

This one's for you, kid.
Now, check this.

There. Don't miss.
[SHOUTlNG lN RUSSlAN]

[EXPLOSlON]
l've been here for 30 minutes.
Shouldn't we see if Konali's inside?
[SlGHS]
The Russian work ethic.
You know, Katrina,
you take this job too seriously.
You have to learn to loosen up.
l want to loosen up.
Had vacation planned. Go to beach.
Now l sit on bench here with you.
You sure you speak with Talinsky?
-Da, Talinsky.
-l not understand.
l should not be here.
Well, you know, Katrina, sometimes
you have to expect the unexpected.
[LAUGHS]
-l know your type.
-My type?
You just like to hunt fox.
You like the chase.
Katrina, go out with me tonight.
Just one date.
Give me a chance.

lt's the Zemskov family. They're great.
They've been doing this act
for over 1 00 years.
They look amazingly spry for their age.
The Zemskov family
passed the act down. . .
. . .from grandfather to father
to son and daughter.
lt's tradition. Keep secrets in family.
Ooh.
Maybe that's one they should
keep a secret.
One more of those, it could be
the end of the Zemskov family.
ANNOUNCER: And now lvan Zemskovi
will perform the impossible!
The triple Salto Mortale.

What are you thinking about?
What's Russian for ''kiss me''?

You know, Konali. . .
. . .he's done many bad things.
But he brought you here.
Where does Konali hang out at night?
-The casino.
-Suddenly l feel the need to gamble.

No food?

Nuts?
-Your little game is over.

Tomorrow it'll all be over. . .

Could you let me up now, please?

And with Konali. . .
. . .he takes ''deadline'' literally.

Okay, stand back. There's only one way
to get this safe open.
Wait a minute. You blow that thing,
Konali's gonna know we were here.
Hmm. What are we gonna do?
[MAKlNG CLlCKlNG SOUNDS]
You're amazing.

Can l get paid now?
Oh.
