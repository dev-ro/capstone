[ man ] For heaven's sake, Wendy,
Look for an airport!
Will you look For the airport?
Oh, don't make such a fuss.
Just put it down
On a mountain.
[ man ] What do you mean,
Just put it down?
I'm lucky I can keep it up.
I told you, I never flew before.
[ Wendy ] Don't shout at me.
I'm a first-class passenger.
[ man ]
You're a first-class lunatic!...
It's all over, Wendy.
Our relationship has
A quarter of a tank to go.
Yes, but you do love me,
Don't you, Harold?
I know this is an awkward time
To bring it up,
But I must know
For our future.
Ohh! Aah!
[ Wendy ] Harold, darling,
Do answer me.
[ Harold screaming ] [ Wendy ]
Oh!
[ no audible dialogue ]
You can stop pretending
To be asleep, Sidney.
It's over.
I was listening to
Beethoven's ninth.
Somewhere on this plane
There's a wonderful orchestra...
The cameraman must do
Luggage commercials. ...
All you could see
Were the bags under my eyes.
We'll be landing in Los Angeles
In five minutes, Miss Barrie.
I suppose we must.
You were terrific!
I loved it!  
Oh, thank you.
That's sweet. 
What? 
Oh. I hope
You win the Oscar!
It's bizarre. 
Eight years with
The national theatre, ...
Two pinter plays,
Nine Shakespeare,
Three Shaw,
And I finally get nominated
For a nauseating little comedy.
That's why
They call it Hollywood.  
Oh!
Gorgeous color.
The smog.
I wonder if
They sell it in bottles.
It would make A wonderful present
For the folks back home.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Mr. Barrie.
The "no smoking" sign's on.
Oh, sorry.
I thought it was meant
For the people down there.
[ laughing ] 
[ sighs ] 
Oh, Christ.
The royal treatment.
And if I lose,
We go home in a station wagon...
[ Sidney ] I can get used to this life
Very easily, darling.
Promise me you'll
Get nominated every year. 
[ man ]
We have a magnificent suite
Back at the hotel for you.
[ woman ] How nice.
[ starts engine ]
I'll call you In half an hour.
Fine.
Thank you.
Well, that's just fine.
Unless you're making
A pot of tea,
I think we're in big trouble.
I didn't build the car.
I just drove it.
Did you look at the gauge
Like I told you to?
I looked at the gauge
More than I looked at the road.
I ran off the road.
I did not run off the gauge.
But if you looked at the gauge,
It wouldn't have overheated.
You mean
Lookin' at the gauge real good
Stops it from overheatin'?
No, but you've got to speak up.
You've got to say,
"hey, the gauge says
We're overheating."
This is not the kind of news
That you keep to yourself.
You know, I hate rent-a-cars.
Why don't we just
Leave it here?
It's cooling off, see?
I told you. All we needed
To do was give it a chance.
All right, close the hood.
Let's go. I'll drive.
Oh, no! Oh, god.
Say he didn't slam the hood.
What's the matter
With the doors? 
Didn't the man say
Not to slam the hood down?...
Didn't the man say the doors
Sometimes lock when
You slam the hood down?
Did the man say
I would burn my hand?  
It's locked, all right.
Who's got the keys?
The car's got the keys!
Why didn't you take the keys?
I only went
From my seat to the hood.
I thought it would be safe.
You on this side.
Stand over there.
what fool closed the windows?
- that fool closed the windows.
Even with my eyes on the gauge,
I saw that fool
Close the windows.
The air-conditioning
Doesn't work with open windows.
Well, now the car doesn't work
With closed windows,
Does it, fool?
Smile, everybody!
We're in los Angeles!
I'm not paying for this window.
Bettina, you're keeping
The books.
Put the window In his column.
We're drivin', ain't we?
We're not bein' towed,
Are we?
Deduct the cost of being towed
From my column.
Oh, when are you two
Gonna stop bickering
And start vacationing?
It's been like this
Ever since we left Chicago.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Can we pull off
And find a gas station?
Okay, honey.
"okay, honey"? 
What do you mean,
"okay, honey"?
This is no time For "okay, honey."
We're on a freeway.
When your wife wanted tacos,
I heard enough "okay, honeys."...
Now, how am I
On that side, honey? ...
[ Bettina ]
You're fine. Hurry up.
He's not fine
If he has to hurry up!  
[ horns honking ]
Now! Now!
Go now!   
[ Bettina screams ]
[ horns honking,
Tires screeching ]
Whiplash!
Now we all got whiplash,
Okay, honey?
Good luck tonight,
Miss Barrie.
Uh, would you?
Oh.
Everyone says
You're going to win.
Listen, Im pleased
Just to be nominated. ...
Can I have
Your picture?...
Oh, just by yourself. ...
Herb, how are you?
Charlie, what do you say?...
Billy boy. How's
The new script coming?...
I found all the words
In the dictionary. I just
Have to put 'em together.
I mean, we'll never
be able to afford this. ...
I mean, the prices
Out here are ridiculous! ...
Yeah, sure.
Mrs. Hannah Warren, please.
I asked them.
Bill Warren. 
[ telephone ringing ]
Yes? 
Where are you?
306.
Why don't you come up?...
[ knocking on door ]
Come in.
One double scotch,
One tea with lemon.
Six dollars And ninety-five cents.
Yes, ma'am.
Would it be possible to just
Rent a couple of drinks? ...
Ma'am?
[ telephone ringing ]
Uh, would you put that
On the coffee table, please? ...
Hello?
Oh, yes, put him on.
Bob? Oh, thank god,
A civilized voice.
How are you? 
No, awful. I can't wait
To get out of here.
It's like paradise
With a lobotomy. 
How's Washington?
Rain. Oh, god.
How wonderful.
No, no, nothing's settled yet.
He's on his way up. 
Bob, I don't want
To call in a lawyer
Until I see how it goes.
When have you known me
To be intimidated?
That doesn't count.
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I remember it in detail.
Bob, can you save
The erotic conversation until
It can do us both some good?
Yes. Yes, I will.
I'll call you
As soon as he leaves.
I do too. Bye.
[ hangs up phone ]
looks like another...
beautiful day, huh? ...
For a change.
Hello, Hannah. 
you were supposed to knock. 
I was going to keep you...
waiting in the hall. ...
You screwed up
My big moment.
You still have trouble
Saying a simple "hello."
Oh, I am sorry.
You always did get a thrill out
Of the little things in life. ...
Hello, bill. ...
Hello, Hannah.
how are you?
- at this moment,
I'm completely nonplussed.
What the hell have you done
To yourself? You've turned
Into a young boy again.
It's good to see you.
I mean it.
You look like the sweetest,
Young, 14-year-old boy.
You're not spending
Your summers at camp, are you?...
Just three weeks
In July. 
Shouldn't we kiss or
Shake hands or something?...
Let's save it
For when you leave.
I made a 1:30 reservation
For lunch.
Is that all right?
Just, uh, give me a minute.
When you haven't seen
Your ex-husband in nine years,
Your eyes have to... Adjust.
I love Your California clothes.
They're Bloomingdales
Of New York. 
It's the best place
For California clothes...
My god,
You look so-- ...
I don't know.
What is the word
I'm looking for?
Happy.
Casual...
You never know out here.
Are you dressed up now,
Or is that sporty?
I didn't think a tie
Was necessary for a reunion.
Is that what this is?
When you walked in like that,
I thought we were
Gonna play tennis.
You certainly look
Fit enough for it...
"fit." You think I look fit?
You awful shit.
I look gorgeous.  
Yes, you do, Hannah. ...
Your tan, of course,
Is perfect.  
I always wondered how
You got the back
Of your ears so dark.
You put the top Of your car down
And drive away from the sun.
Look, if we're gonna
Banter like this,
Give me a little time.
After nine years,
I'm a little rusty.
Oh, you'll pick it Right up again.
It's like French.
You see, that's what Id miss
If I ever left New York--
The bantering.
San Franciscos
Only an hour away...
We go up there
And banter in emergencies.
I never liked San Francisco.
I was always afraid...
I'd fall out of bed and
Roll down one of those hills. ...
Not you, Hannah.
You roll up hills.
Oh, good.
You're bantering. 
The flight out
Wasn't a total loss.
I detect a bit of snip
In the air.
Does that mean
Your conversation with jenny
Wasn't all that successful?
Oh, I don't know.
I thought that we glared
At each other rather well.
I ordered a drink before lunch.
I thought one of us
Might be a little nervous.
I gave up
Double scotches on the rocks
Six years ago.
I'm big on apple juice
These days.  
Well, I guess Im the one
That's nervous. 
It's obvious this place
Agrees with you, bill...
Or do they call you Billy?...
That's right.
Jenny told me.
Everybody calls you Billy.
That's me-- Billy.
it's just adorable. ...
Forty-four-year-old Billy
Standing there...
In his cute little sneakers
And sweater.
You'd better sit down, Billy.
You're making me feel like
Your math teacher.
I promised myself driving
Over here I would be pleasant.
I am now being pleasant.
You drive everywhere, do you?
Even to your car?
Everywhere.
If we're going,
I think we'd better get started.
You have changed, Billy.
You know, you don't get rattled
As easily as you used to.
Well, they don't have
As many rattlers out here.
Maybe this lunch won't be
As dull as I thought.
Marvin!
Hey, Marvin!  
Harry!
[ laughing ]
Hey!
Hey, boy!
Harry.  
You-you got so bald.
How did you get so bald?
You don't see your brother
In five years,
That's all you gotta say?
I didn't even know It was you,
You got so bald.
Where's Millie?
She's coming in
On the morning plane.
We don't like to fly together
On account of the kids.
You got so bald!
Hey, Marvin, take a gander.
Hmm? Oh, Id give up
Two years of my life for
One hour with each of them.
[ Marvin ]
You still haven't changed,
Have you?
Let's say "hello."
Let's see how far we can get.
Hey, don't start in
With me, harry.
I'm here one night Without Millie.
Don't get me into trouble.
Would I do that to you?
You did it to papa
When he was 82 years old.
Don't do it to me. 
Oh, miss? You-- Stop already
With the girls!
Your kid is getting
Bar Mitzvahed tomorrow...
Hey, stop it. What is this,
A jogging outfit?
That's what we do here.
[ Hannah ]
Jenny tells me you've moved.
You're not in
Hardy canyon anymore.
Laurel.
Laurel canyon.
Laurel, hardy,
What the hell.
She says it's sort of
A small French farmhouse...
With a little water mill
In back...
And the sweetest
Little tennis court.
That's right.
Sounds awfully rugged.
Well, we're from pioneer stock
Out here in the west.
There's a glass house
Two blocks down the road if you
Want to throw some more stones.
Maybe Ill just drop something
From the plane...
When I leave tonight...
With jenny.
This is very familiar.
Yeah.
The house we rented
The year before jenny was born
Is just down the road there.
That wasn't a bad summer,
Was it?
I thought it was terrific.
[ sighs ] ...
Yes, well, the pacific ocean
Was a lot more interesting
In those days.
[ bill ] No, thank you.
No cigarettes either?
No, I gave them up
Eight years ago.
Don't you miss the coughing
And the hacking
In the morning?
It woke the dogs up.
I have dogs now.
Isn't divorce wonderful?
You have changed, Billy.
You've gone clean on me.
Tell me, what else do you do
To keep that winsome
Adolescent look?
You're just dying
To make a little fun of me,
Aren't you?
No, I don't mind.
I have an hour to kill.
Would you believe I, uh,
I run five miles
Every morning?
After what?
Oh.
After a good night's sleep.
I don't even have a pill
In my medicine cabinet,
And I gave up analysis.
Oh, I heard that.
Why did you quit?
I went sane.
Sane? My god.
How boring.
Tell me something, Billy,
Don't you ever get depressed?...
Yes.
When?...
Now.
And I, uh, I hear
You went in for an operation. ...
A hysterectomy.
It was nothing...
I have them every year...
I understood you had,
Uh, prostate trouble.
Small world, isn't it?  
Well, our past sins Do have a way
Of catching up with us.
Jenny tells me
You have a new boyfriend. 
[ chuckles ] No. 
I have a lover.
Jenny has boyfriends.
Oh.
A writer in the
Washington Post, 
Im told. ...
mm-hmm. ...
He's 54 years old,
He has a heart condition, ...
Asthma,
Leans toward alcoholism.
He also has the second-best mind
I've met in this country
Since Adlai Stevenson.
What's with you mate-wise?...
"mate-wise"?
Mate-wise, Im seeing
A very nice girl.  
Are you? Where are
You seeing her to?
Come on, Hannah.  
I beg your pardon.
Have I offended you?
My god, it's a long time
Since Ive been involved
In a smart-ass conversation.
I'm sorry,
But you're the one
That said things like,
"I hear you have a boyfriend,"
And "Im seeing
A very nice girl."
I'm not the one with
The Bobsey twin haircut
And the peter pan phraseology.
I can see you've really come
To hunt bear, haven't you?
Hunt bear?...
Is that what you said?
"hunt bear"?
Is that the kind of nifty
Conversation you have...
Around the campfires out here
In the rugged west?
Can we talk about jenny? 
What's your rush?
She's only 17.
She has her whole life
Ahead of her.
If Im gonna turn my daughter
Over to you, which I am not, ...
At least I wanna know
What you're like.
Jenny is our daughter.
Ours.
Maybe. We'll see.
They've been a little slow
With the blood test.
Christ.
Five million cigarettes...
Are murder on the lungs. 
[ panting ] Oh! 
When you were younger,
You were the healthiest girl
I knew. What happened?
With Nixon in the White House,
Good health seemed to be
In bad taste.
Your friend's about
A size too small for me. 
How does she fit you?
Nicely, thank you.
Is this the neophyte actress
With the golden hair
Jenny's been telling me about?
Am I being too nosy?
Not for a Newsweek editor.
Yes, she is, and she's
A damned good actress.
Married before;
Has a nine-year-old boy. 
Really? Should make
A nice pet for jenny. ...
Is marriage contemplated?
It's contemplated.
It's being discussed
And seriously considered.
And we all get along
Like clams.
Right. And would there
Be room for all of you in
The little French farmhouse?
Or will you have to take them
To a Moroccan villa
On Wilshire boulevard?
What the hell
Are you so bitter about?
You used to be bright and witty,
And now you're just
Snide and sarcastic.
It comes with age.
When you don't have
A fastball anymore,
You go to
Change-ups and sliders.
Can we go?
I feel like we're playing
From here to eternity.
Pretty girl.
I think so.
I suppose if jenny stays,
She'll grow up
To look like that--
Blonde hair, blonde teeth,
Blonde life. 
God, I can just hear
The quips flying...
When you and
The second-best mind since
Adlai Stevenson get together.
Sitting there freezing
Under a blanket at
The Washington redskins games,
Playing anagrams
With the names of all
The polish players.
Your mind clicks off
Bric-a-brac so goddamn fast...
It never has a chance for
An honest emotion or thought
Ever to get through.
And you're so filled
With honest emotion, ...
You fall in love every time
Someone sings a ballad.
You're worse
Than a hopeless romantic.
You're a hopeful one.
You're the kind of man who would
End the world famine problem
By having them all eat out,
Preferably at a good
Chinese restaurant.
Oh, for god's sake, Hannah.
Let's stop this crap.
I don't know if your bitterness
Is because jenny ran away...
Or because she ran away
To somebody whose lifestyle...
Epitomizes everything
You consider cheap and banal. ...
I don't have a lifestyle. 
 I have a life. 
You have no legal rights To her.
You understand that?
Certainly.
Then tell her
To come home with me.
I did.
She would like to try it
With me for a year.
She's not happy
In New York, Hannah.
Nobody's happy in New York,
But they're alive.  
What a snob you are.
Thank god there's
A few of us left.  
[ dryer whirring ]
what is there so beautiful...
about your life...
That makes it so important
To put down everyone else's? ...
[ shuts dryer off ]
New York is not the center
Of the goddamn universe.
I grant you,
It's an exciting, vibrant,
Stimulating, fabulous city,
But it is not Mecca.
It just smells like it.
To hell with New York
Or Boston or Washington.
I don't care where jenny lives.
I care how.
She's a bright girl
With an intelligent mind.
Let it grow and prosper.
What the hell is she
Gonna learn in a community...
Whose greatest literary
Achievement is the map
Of the movie stars' homes?
Tell me about it,
Hannah.
Tell me about The political elite
On Marthas vineyard in July.
I remember vividly
Those charity luncheons...
To raise money for
The California grape pickers. ...
A teeming mob of women
Who must have spent $12,000
On Gucci pants...
So they could raise 2,000
For the grape pickers.
Why the hell didn't they just
Mail them the pants?
You were terrific when
You used to write like that.
I haven't seen your newest film.
I'm told it grossed very well
In backward areas.
Jesus. Was I anything
Like you before?
I couldn't hold a candle to you.
No wonder
Nobody here talked to me
For the first two years.
Lucky you.  
Look, we have
To settle this today.
If you respect jenny
As a person, then respect
Her right to make a free choice.
You get her for the summers.
That's enough.
It takes me the other
Ten months of the year to get
The seaweed out of her brains.
How much time do you
Spend with her? 
How often do you have
Breakfast with her? ...
How many nights a week
Does she eat dinner alone?...
You really think she's
Happy with that $20 bill
You give her...
Every time you go off
To Washington
For the weekend?
The girl is growing up
Lonely, Hannah,  
And she's flown out here
On her own savings
To prove it to you.
She has two dogs,
A Dominican cook,
And every good-looking boy
In the senior class
Living off my refrigerator.
Despite her gothic reports,
She is not living
The life of Jane Eyre.
Would you like to know what
Jenny has to say about you?
She told me. She thinks
I'm a son of a bitch.
She also thinks
I'm a funny son of a bitch.
She loves me,
But she doesn't like me.
She's afraid of me.
She's intimidated by me.
She respects me,
But she doesn't wanna
Become like me.
We have a perfectly normal
Mother-daughter relationship. ...
How the hell
Can you be so flippant... ...
When it comes to your
Own daughter's well-being?
And how the hell
Can you be so pompous...
Not to recognize a perfectly
Normal, rebellious attitude
In a young girl?
If she didn't complain,
I'd probably send her
To an expensive shrink.
Since she's with me
Ten months of the year,
It is only normal You're the one
She's going to miss.
I think by and large she and I
Have managed quite well.
But like all young girls,
She needs a father image.
I don't mind.
If it's only July and august,
It might as well be you.
This is April,
And she came out
Without your permission.
She never had
A good head for dates.
What would you do if
I just keep her here with me?
I will call my friend,
The attorney general
Of the united states,
If she's not on
The 9:00 plane tonight.
Why didn't you ever run
For office, Hannah?
I always thought you'd have made
A hell of a governor.
I don't think A democratic system
Really works.
Offer me a monarchy,
And we'll talk.
It's 2:30.
Will you call jenny or shall I?
No.
no, what? 
no, sir. 
The truth, Hannah.
You know if we leave it
Up to jenny, you don't
Stand a chance in hell...
Of getting her On that plane.
Certainly.
Why else would the ninny
Run away? 
Who said
We don't have problems?
She is 17 years old,
And when we go at each other,
She needs another shoulder
To cry on.
But Ill be goddamned if
I'm gonna give up a daughter.....
For a pink cashmere shoulder
Three thousand miles away...
This is an event.
It's the first time in my life
I've ever seen you so nervous...
[ chuckles ]
I'm not nervous.
I'm scared to death.
That's good of you
To admit it. 
But honesty always was
One of your strengths.
You're pretty cute yourself.
I mean it.
Oh, why do men
Have to get better looking
When they get older?
Remind me to bring it up with
The equal rights commission. ...
[ Marvin ] So where are the stars?
I don't see any stars yet.
[ harry ]
They come out at night.
I'll pick you up for dinner
At 6:30 in front of the hotel...
Suit and tie,
Or sloppy like you?
[ sighs ]
Look at that beauty. Mmm!
They fall out of the trees
Here like oranges. 
Lucky thing I didn't move out here.
I'd be bald, like you.
How come you're so preoccupied
With sex, sex, sex?
I thought all that jogging,
You'd forget about sex.
You know something better?
Thank you.
Here you go. Thanks.
You're still the same--
Girls, girls, girls.
You fall apart every time
You see a tuchas.   
[ telephone ringing ]
%% [ big band on radio ]  
Hello?
Oh, yes.
How are you?
Well, she's a bit nervous,
I think.
Do you really think she will?
Well, let's hope so.
Oh, yes, and, uh,
Thank you for the flowers
And for the fruit...
And for the lovely suite
And for the caviar...
And for everything else
You send up by the hour.
One moment, Joe.
Diana, it's Joe Pickman. 
Tell him Im in the can.
The man has paid for this trip,
He's paid for this suite.
He's given you the best part
You've had in five years.
I am not gonna tell him
You're in the can. 
Then Ill tell him...
Joe, darling. ...
I told Sidney to tell you
I was in the can.  
I didn't want to speak
To you, that's why.
Well, because I feel
So responsible.
I don't want to
Let you down tonight.
I know how much this film
Means to you,
And I want so much
To win this award for you, Joe.
No, there was
No picture without you.
Well, goddamn it, it's true.
After four studios
Turned it down,
You deserve some
Special perseverance award.
you're a chubby little man, 
and I adore you. 
If I win tonight, darling,...
It's not going to be
An Oscar.  
It's going to be a...
Joe Pickman.
You're an angel. ...
- that was very sweet.
- did you like it, dear? ...
That's gonna be
My acceptance speech.
Your acceptance speech?
All except the part
That I was in the can.
[ chuckles ] Well, naturally,
You and I know I don't have
A hope in hell, but
You have to prepare something.
you can't just
stand there sobbing...
all over Burt Reynolds. ...
You've got as much chance
As anyone else.
[ TV, indistinct ]...
No, I-- I don't have the sentiment
On my side.
You've got to have
A sentimental reason...
For them to vote for you. ...
Any decent actress
Can give a good performance,
But a dying husband, that
Would have insured everything...
You wouldn't like to get
Something fatal for me,
Would you, angel?
You should've told me sooner.
I could've come over
On the Hindenburg. ...
We are dreadful,
Aren't we, Sidney?...
God will punish us.
I think he already has.  
Let's do something naughty.
You always think of such
Good naughty things to do.
I was naughty All day yesterday.
Not with me, you weren't.
You'll just have to learn
To show up on time.
Well, except for
An extremely critical decision
That's still to be made,
It's been a nice day.
What do you say, Hannah? 
I'm out of cigarettes.
I can't be expected to give up
My daughter and cigarettes
On the same day.
Goddamn it!
I only have
One more year with her.
Next September,
She's gonna go to college.
She's gonna come out
In four years
A revolutionary or a nun.
Or worse,
Like you or me. 
A little bit of both
Wouldn't be so bad.
Do you like your mother? 
My mother?
She's dead.
Don't quibble.
Did you like her? 
Yes, I liked her.
I don't like mine much.  
Can you imagine being
A pain in the ass
For 78 years?
I knew there was something wrong
Even when I was in the womb.
I never felt comfortable.
I think I was hanging too low...
[ sighs ] 
We shouldn't have had jenny.
People like you and me,
We're too selfish.
And I-- I don't want her...
To grow up hating me, ...
And I don't wanna see her
Growing up out here...
'Cause Im scared
I'm gonna hate her.
I know.
Maybe you and I should've
Stayed together.
We could've--
We could've let jenny go, huh?
What do you think?
I think you're still one
Of the most interesting women
I've ever met.
He's not gonna live long,
You know. 
Who isn't?
My friend
At the Washington post.
He had open-heart surgery
That was a total waste of time...
I'm sorry to hear that.
So am I.
The man could really
Make me laugh.  
Oh, well,
You win some, lose some. ...
Talk about resiliency.
Oh. For a smart lady
In a man's world, 
I'm not doing so bad.
Tell me something, bill.
Is being in love better now? ...
Yes.  
- why?
- because it's now.
Oh, Christ.
I can't wait
To become a grandmother.
I think I screwed up
The first time around...
[ telephone ringing ]
Yes.  
I see.
Yeah, I understand.
No, no, no.
I'll take care of it. 
Okay, bye-bye.
[ hangs up phone ] 
It's jenny.
She's downstairs
With her bags packed.
She says it's up to us.
She'll abide by
Whatever decision
we both make...
And you agreed?
Certainly.  
Oh, what a cunning bastard
You are. 
If we say she goes back
To New York, she's
Gonna think I coerced you.
We say she stays here,
She's gonna think I didn't
Even put up a fight for her.
You think she has
That devious a mind? 
Of course.
She's my daughter.
I don't suppose you'd consider
Spending ten months
Of the year back east?
Only if
Everyone there leaves.
You want me to make it
Easy for you, Hannah?
I'll throw in my vote.
Whatever you say goes,
And Ill tell jenny
We both made the decision.
Oh, Jesus.
No wonder there's so many
Used car salesmen out here.
How much time do I have?
I've always panicked
At deadlines.
As much time as you want. ...
Is it only from here
She looks so small to me?...
I say she goes back.
I see.
All right,
Then she goes back. 
You think Im wrong,
Don't you?  
I'm disappointed,
But I trust your instincts...
If you feel it's right,
I have enough faith in jenny
That she'll see it too.
Im--
I'm so afraid
I'm going to lose her, bill. ...
What are you looking at?
This is a new color for you--
Vulnerable.  
Well, take a picture of it,
'Cause you're not
Gonna see it again.
[ whispers ] Keep her.
what?
I said, keep her. ...
But for six months,
Not a year.
And I get to choose the school,
And any school I choose has
To give me three references.
God, what am I doing?
Stay the weekend, Hannah.
Talk it over again with jenny.
You don't have to make
A decision just because
You got a plane ticket.
I'm a fighter, Billy.
If I stay the weekend,
I'll not only take jenny
Back with me, I might take your
Goddamn girlfriend back too.
Don't let me bully you
Into this, Hannah. 
Look, why can't The three of us
Talk it out?
I'm gonna get jenny Up here.
No, goddamn it!
If I have to give her up
To get her back,
Then let's do it.
You never stop
Amazing me, Hannah...
I'll tell you one thing.
You're not the same woman
I left nine years ago.
And Im missing
The ovaries to prove it. 
Well, guess who's
Nonplussed now?
You never thought
I'd say "yes," did you? 
Keep up that
Pioneer spirit, Billy...
You're gonna need it raising
A 17-year-old daughter.
I think you're doing
A terrific thing, Hannah. ...
So do I.
I suppose you wanna see her
Before you go?
well, you suppose wrong.
I've seen her.
I'll call her
When I get to New York.
Bell captain, please. 
What should I tell her? ...
Tell her I hope she'll be
Very happy and Im selling
Her record collection.
Would you send someone up
For the luggage, room 306?...
Thank you. 
You know, we couldn't
Have been too bad together.
We produced a hell of a girl.
I think you have that
A little wrong.
I think the two of you
Produced a hell of a mother.
Maybe you're right.
Um, can we shake hands now?
I'm about to leave. 
Sure.
What more can I lose?...
[ elevator door opening ] 
N-no--
Serve her plenty of broccoli
And lima beans. 
- she likes them?
- she hates them. 
But from now on,
What do I care?
Good-bye, Hannah.
It was very good
Seeing you again.
I feel like a--
Like an artist...
About to part with a painting
That she doesn't want to sell...
I'll frame it and keep it
In a good light.
Do that. ...
Take care
Of my daughter too...
Bye.
What do you mean,
Just one room?
There are two reservations.
Dr. And Mrs. Willis Panama,
Dr. And Mrs. Chauncey Gump.
I have here one deluxe room,
Double bed,
For dr. And Mrs. Panama
On the 3rd, 4th and 5th.
Yes.
I have nothing
For a dr. Gump.
There must be a clerical error
Or an omission of intelligence,
Because my travel agent
Made the reservation.
Now, he's my wife's brother,
And he's also my patient.
I wish you'd double-check it.
I already double-checked
Our files.
Here's the telegram we received.
You can see for yourself.
Yes, I can see that my name
Is missing from this wire.
But as you can see,
I'm not missing
From your hotel.
Now, there's four of us,
And we need two rooms.  
I don't have Two rooms available.
I'm sorry.
It's academy award week.
We don't care who wins.
We just wanna get into bed.
I do have
A small single.
However, there is
Some repair going on.
It's not terribly comfortable,
But I can squeeze
A small daybed in.
I'm sorry, but it's
The best I can do.
Well, what do we do?
I'm not gonna stand
Around here with whiplash
And argue with the man.
I'm gonna check in
To the Hilton. Let's go, baby...
Well, it's our last few days
Of vacation. I'd hate
For us not to be together.
What do you mean,
"not be together"? We're all
Gonna check into the Hilton.
Well, they do have A reservation
For the two of us.
You wanna stay in this hotel
After the way
They've been treatin' us?
Well, they're treatin'
Me and Bettina all right.
I really had my heart
Set on staying here.
It's so pretty here, Chauncey.
Oh, listen. Listen.
What?
Even a tiny room in this place
Couldn't be too bad.
And it's only For two nights.
Please, Chaunce?
Come on.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
We'll toss for the small room.
Why? I already
Have my reservation.
Willis, you're not thinkin'
What I hope you're not thinkin'.
I didn't make the reservation.
I don't see why
We have to suffer...
Because her brother is an idiot.
We see enough blood
In the hospital.
I don't wanna see any blood
In this hotel lobby.
Now, either we toss
For the room, goddamn it,
Or we toss for the room.
Now, call it.
I'm not tossing
For any room.
I'm going up
To my registered room,
Sit in my reserved bath.
Come on, honey.
No, no.
Take it easy.
What time is it?
What?
What time is it?
It's a quarter to 1:00.
I want you to remember
That time, 'cause that's when
We declared war.
Yes, we'd like the court
From 10:00 to 11:00
Tomorrow morning.
And split the charges
With me and dr. Gump. ...
Balls and everything.
All right, thank you.
We got it!
We are set, tomorrow morning...
And we're gonna cream 'em
Six-love, six-love.  
And if we have time-- [ together ]
Six-love again.
[ telephone ringing ] ...
hello?
- Chaunce? Hi, buddy.
What you doin'?
Oh, nothing much.
Uh, just sittin' here
Watchin' the toilet flush.
It's been flushing
About two hours now,
Wouldn't you say, hon?
Well, that's too bad.
You and Lola
Wanna use our john?
Nah. We were thinkin'
About waitin' till
We get back to Chicago.
Well, we're all set.
Tomorrow morning, 10:00 a.m.
How's that?
Fine, fine.
[ chuckling ] 
Sneakers'll be
A little damp though,
But you won't mind.
What time we going
To the Greek restaurant? ...
Lola wants to know
What time we're going
To the Greek restaurant.
Oh, didn't I tell you?
Bettina felt like Japanese,
So I booked Fujiyamas
For 7:30.
We'll see you
Down in the lobby, 7:15.
Now, don't be late, ya hear?
Fine.
That man will never
Get to Chicago alive.
The, uh, real dark horse
In this year's Oscar derby... ...
Seems to be Diana Barrie, ...
One of the most respected
Actresses in the business
And perhaps best known...
[ ringing ] For her portrayals of
Shakespearean queens...
And pinter heroines at
London's national theatre...
Diana is up For her first Oscar...
Hello?
In the funny but featherweight
Comedy that might have
Slipped by unnoticed--
Oh, yes. Yes.
We'll be down in about,
Uh, five minutes.
Thank you. 
Sidney?
Yes?     
Sidney, take a look.....
And-and try
To be gentle.
Channel two just picked you
As a dark horse.  
they must have seen The dress.
you hate it.
How much was it?
Nothing.
Joe Pickman paid for it.
Then I love it.
Damn it. 
I wish you didn't have
Such good taste.
I have a definite hump
On my left shoulder. ...
It cost 500 pounds,
And I look like Richard III.
Do you notice the hump,
Sidney? 
[ clears throat ] Isn't that
Your regular hump?
Don't joke with me.
I am going
On national television.
There are no humps...
I can see no humps
At this particular time.
I should've worn
Something simple. ...
My black pantsuit...
Why the hell didn't I wear
My black pantsuit?
Because I am wearing it.
We should never have come...
I never know how to dress
In this bloody country.
It's so easy
To dress in England.
You just put on
Warm clothing...
Why did we come, Sidney?
Because it's free, darling.
Glenda Jackson never comes...
She's nominated
Every goddamn year.
We could have stayed in London
And waited for a telephone call.
David Niven could have
Accepted for me.
He'd have been bright and witty,
And no one would've
Noticed my hump.
Use it, sweetheart.
People will pity you
For your deformity,
And you're sure to win.
Maybe if you put
Your arm on my shoulder.
Keep your arm on my shoulder
At all times. 
If I win We'll go up together,
Your arm around me.
They'll think we're
Still mad for each other
After 12 years.
Oh, I thought we were.
I keep forgetting. 
How many gin and tonics
Have you had?
Three gins and one tonic.
Catch up on the tonics...
We don't want to be
Disgusting tonight, do we?...
What's wrong with my hair?
I look like
I've combed it with a towel.
When you played Elizabeth
You looked like a warthog,
And you never complained once.
That was acting.
This is living.
Living,
I want to be beautiful.
It's the strangest color.
I asked for a simple rinse,
And that ditsy queen's
Given me crayon.  
Shall I walk with my arm
On your head as well?
Oh, Christ. I hate
Getting dressed like this.
Why is it Im always
Perfectly comfortable
As somebody else?
I'd of been perfectly happy
Going as Hedda Gabler.  
Try Quasimodo.
Try shutting up!
Now, check me out.
Do I have too much jewelry on?...
Jingle it. I can't tell
If I don't hear it.
Will you please
Be nice to me and pay me
One bloody compliment?
I've been getting ready
For this horseshit affair
For three hours.
- Diana, you're just--
- what? What?
[ chuckling ] I was-- 
I was just gonna say
You're making a mountain
Out of a molehill.
But I didn't think
It would amuse you.
That's not funny, Sidney. ...
That's bizarre.
Give me a drink.
You have the most bizarre
Sense of humor.
Bizarre people often do.
Give me a bit more.
It's all right.
I won't get pissed
Till after I lose. 
The car is waiting.
Oh, god.
Why do they have
These things so early?
I mean, no woman can look good
At 5:00 in the afternoon, 
Except possibly
Tatum ONeal.
Finish your drink.
Mmm.
I don't want to miss
The sound editing awards.
Oh, those bloody photographers
And newsmen.
I can't wait
To see how they explain
My hump in the papers.
Where are you going?
I need another drink. ...
The last one
Wore off in the lift.
Gin and tonic, please.
Nothing for me...
I heard that if you're late,
They put nondescript people
In your seats.
Do you know what I might do
Next year, Sidney?
I pray anything but Ibsen.
I might give it all up.
It's no fun anymore.
Oh, god, how I envy you.
You're the one With all the talent.
I'm the one...
Who has to make
A horse's ass of myself.
Talent?
What talent do I have?
You have nothing but talent.
You cook better than I do,
You write better than I do.
God knows you dress
Better than I do.  
Better than "I."
The "do" is superfluous.
You speak better than I do--
What's that green slime
You're eating?
It looks like a dish
Out of Oliver Twist. 
I'm not sure.
I think they run the front lawn
Through a blender.
You've got that glazed look
In your eye again, Sidney--
That "bored-with-her-life"
Attitude.   
I'm never bored
With your life, my angel. ...
I love the openings
And the parties. ...
I lead a very gay life.
Let's be honest, pet. ...
How many antique dealers
Get to go to
The academy awards?
I think you hate
That dusty little shop.
You're never there When I call.
Could I, miss Barrie?
It's for my daughter.
Excuse me.
Oh, certainly.
What's her name?
Uh--
Just say, "to frank."
What do you do
With your afternoons, Sidney?...
In London?
I don't think
We have afternoons.
Gin and tonic, pl-- Check, please...
Come along.
you should never have
given it up, Sidney.  
What?
Acting.
Christ, you were good.
You had more promise
Than any of us.
Really? I can't think
What it was I promised.
You were so gentle
On the stage.
So unselfish, so giving.
You had a sweet,
Gentle quality.
Yes. I would've made
A wonderful Ophelia.
You could go back, Sidney,
If you wanted to.
We could do plays together,
Have more time together.
No, there'd be problems.
It would be awful if we were
Both up for the same part.
I'm perfectly happy selling
My 18th century door knockers...
You still haven't told me
What you do
With your afternoons.
I just told you,
I look for knockers.
[ speaking Spanish ] 
I think I got it stopped,
But you won't be able to use
The water in the bathroom...
For a while.
Oh, it's okay...
We have enough
On the floor to last us.
Thank you.
Okay, hurry up.
What? Lola--
The man is 20 minutes late.
How would you like to be lying
On an operating table...
With tubes going in your nose,
Waiting for him to show up?
Your brother's
Gonna pay for this.
I'm tired of being nice
To that man. The next time
I take his x rays,
Wait till I tell him
What I found on them.
My feet are still wet.
The foot powder
Is turning into concrete.
nine Japanese restaurants
in ten nights? 
I am sick and disgusted
Of stepping on raw fish.....
In my stocking feet That that man
Drops on the floor.
Now, come on, woman.
This is pearl harbor night...
Can we get going?
I'll drive.
You'll what?
Do you know where Fujiyama's is?
No.
I'll drive.
Why don't you two argue
In the back? I'll drive.
Okay, honey.
"okay, honey"? Watch out
When he says, "okay, honey."
I feel like
A caged animal, Sidney.
They look as though they're
Going to throw nuts at us.
[ Sidney ] Nonsense, darling.
They're just ogling us.
I adore being ogled,
Don't you?
Oh, Sidney!
Yes?   
Sidney, kiss me.
Kiss me and wish me luck.
There's your kiss.
Now turn around so I can
Rub your hump for luck.
Sidney, please be nice to me.
I'm scared to death.
I wish you everything.
I wish you luck,
I wish you love,
I wish you happiness.
You are a gifted
And remarkable woman.
I hope you win
The bloody Oscar.
Fifty years from now,
I'll be able to sell it
For a fortune.
Just hold my hand, angel. 
[ cheering, whistling ]
And now,
Ladies and gentlemen,
To again prove that
The academy awards are
Indeed international in scope,
We're so pleased
To welcome here from London...
The academy award nominee
For her best performance...
In that wonderful picture
No right turns--  
No, it's called
no left turns. 
Miss Diana Barrie
And her very handsome husband,
Mr. Sidney Barrie.
Sidney Cochran.
Sidney Cochran.
[ siren wailing ]
And you say when you put
Your foot on the brakes,
Nothing happened?
I didn't say "nothing happened."
I said that the brakes
Didn't work.
When the brakes didn't work,
That's when
Nothing good happened.
You snapped the cable
Holding the cars.
I've never seen
Anything like this in my life...
I thought it was a jet...
I thought, "oh, god,
We've just been 747'd."...
My legs are paralyzed...
I can't move.
My legs are paralyzed.
Okay, we're gonna get you out
As fast as we can, all right?...
It's not from the car.
It's from sittin' in
A Japanese restaurant.
Hold on tight.
I'll get you
A cup of coffee, all right?
Congratulations.  
Come on.
It's after 3:00.
Don't give me that
Superior-than-thou crap. 
You're stinking,
Aren't you?
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm a lady.
A loser and a lady.
One of the great
Losing ladies of the cinema. ...
[ Marvin ] You remember that night
Up in the Catskills...
When you ran away and
You came back an hour later...
Because you stepped in
The cow doo-doo?  
[ both laughing ] ...
Oh, that was funny.
Whoo, am I tanked, harry.
Are you sure
This is the right hotel?
Don't ask me. I'm blind.
Hey, bubbie,
Thanks for a terrific evening...
Thank me in the morning.
The night is not over yet.
What do you mean?
What are you smiling about? ...
Sleep well, kid.
Don't forget to leave
An early wake-up call.
What are you talking about?
What's going on here?
[ tires screeching ]
I don't trust that guy.
Something's going on here.
%% [ humming ]
Hi. I'm bunny.
Is this 203?
%% happy birthday
From your brother harry %%...
%% happy birthday to you %% 
[ pouring drink ]
This is not my birthday.
My birthday isn't
Until next month.
I'm in no hurry. ...
Tequila? 
You never told me
What award I missed
When I went to the can.
The best documentary
Short subject.
Oh, damn it.
My favorite category.
What won?  
the midgets of Leipzig. 
a Czech-polish production. 
Sigmund Wednetski, producer. ...
Directed by Litweil Zumbredowicz
And Stefan Vlech.
Mmm.
I thought they would. ...
What was the best picture?
The best picture?
You were there
When they announced it.
It came after
The best actress.  
I was in a deep depression
At the time. What was
The best bloody picture?
Do you mean what was
The best picture of the year,
Or what did those idiots...
Pick as the best picture
Of the year? 
What won the award,
You asshole? 
I am not an asshole.
Don't you call me that.
Sidney, I have just thrown up
On some of the best people
In Hollywood.
Now is no time To be sensitive.
What was the best picture?
I'm not telling you.
I'm not asking you...
I'm threatening you,
You crud!
Now Im definitely
Not going to tell you.
I'm sorry.
I take it back, Sidney.
You're not a crud.
[ gasps ] God! Definitely.
Am I still an asshole?
Then Im never going To tell you.
You behaved abominably tonight.
Did not. Did not.
Asshole crud!
Abominably. Abominably.
I am going to bed.
We have a 10:00 a.m. Plane
To catch in the morning.
10:00 a.m. Is the morning...
That is redundant,
You a-h.
Oh, do you think I don't know
What you're saying?
I can spell, you know.
Not without moving
Your lips, you can't.
I would like
Another drink, please.  
You drank everything In this state.
Try Nevada.
Oh, Sidney! 
I saw your privates.
[ chuckling ]
You were right.
We should never
have come here...
Have you ever seen a greater
Assemblage of hypocrites.....
Under one roof
In all your life?  
Were the hypocrites there?
Why didn't you
Point them out to me?
Hypocritical hypocrites.
They love you and fawn over you
On the way in.
And if you're a loser
When you come out, it's...
"too bad, darling.
Give us a call
When you're back in town."
You should have thrown up over
The whole bloody lot of them. ...
Sidney? 
yes?    
Was I hit by a bus?
I look as though I was hit
By a fully-loaded,
Guided tour bus.
Did you notice how quickly
The winners got their cars? ...
They must have known
Beforehand who the winners
Were going to be...
In order for the winners
To get their cars
Before everyone else.
We've come 6,000 miles
For this bloody affair, and
They park our car in Vancouver.
I've aged, Sidney.
I'm getting lines
In my face.
I look like a brand-new,
Steel-belted radial tire.
Even Litwell Zubredowicz and
Stefan Vlech got their cars
Before we did.
And then, those little twerps--
They splashed water all over
My trousers as they drove by.
I'm hungry. 
- what are you doing?
- Im phoning room service.
I want some eggs benedict.
Hello?
Eggs benedict, please.
You have to ask
For room service first, twit.
Room service, please.
- twit and a half.
- oh, touché.
Isn't there anyone there?
I only wanted
Some eggs benedict.
Oh. 
Oh, I see. Mmm. 
Well, it just isn't
My night, is it?
Where are you going?
To their bloody kitchen to make
Myself some eggs benedict.
- twit!
- twitette!
[ rattling ]
Lola, I don't feel so good.
What is it?
Raw fish and wet feet.
I'd like to throw up,
But the room is too small.
Lola, I think I'm gonna throw up.
Oh.
I'm positive.
I'm gonna-- Lola!
All right.
Lola, it's coming.
Lola!  
Lola. Lola!
[ groans ]
[ telephone ringing ]...
Who could that be At this hour?
Who do you think?
[ sighs ] Their game plan is to see
That we don't get any sleep.
Hello?
It's Lola.
Yes, Lola.
What? You're kidding...
Well, tell him to take
Two compid spansules. ...
What?
Listen, I don't make
House calls when Im working.
Why should I on vacation?
All right,
All right, all right.
I'll be there. All right.
He's purposely doing this.
He knows I don't play well
Without eight hours sleep.
I'll give him sleeping pills.
He won't be able to raise
His racket for a week.
Willis, don't start in.
He'll sue you for malpractice...
But we'll win the match.
I found the people
at the Oscars singularly...
unattractive this year. ...
didn't you? 
oh, Christ. 
I noticed a general decline in
Face-lifts and hair transplants.
Must be the economy,
Don't you think?  
Did you get your eggs
Benedictined?
Bitchy. Bitchy, darling.
You haven't started
Anything naughty without me,
Have you?
I didn't expect to see you
Until dawn.
I heard lots of other cats
Prowling around out there.
Well, we're not all
As lucky as you, Sidney.
You got your prowling in early.
who was he, Sidney?
- what are you talking about?
That adorable young actor you
Were chatting with all night. ...
Gorgeous, wasn't he?
Where did you find him?
He was at our table.
We shared a butter plate. 
How spreadably cozy.
Careful, darling.
We're tired, and we're smashed.
Let's not
Get into shallow waters. 
Oh, I am sorry.  
Let's just talk showbiz,
Shall we?
Well, who did you
Vote for tonight, Sidney?
I don't vote, dear.
I'm not a member
Of the motion picture academy.
I'm an antique dealer.
One day, when you're an antique,
I shall vote for you.
That's a promise.
No, I mean who did you
Vote for privately-- ...
In the deep, deep,
Inner twit recesses...
Of your redundant mind? ...
When miss no-talent Ran up there,
All teeth and teary-eyed,
I could feel The tension release
From every part of your body.
What a nasty streak you have
When you drink.
Also when you eat
And sit and walk.
picky. Picky, Sidney. ...
are you unhappy
'cause you didn't get...
to wear my dress? 
If I had worn your dress,
It would have hung properly. ...
Nothing personal.
There never is
anything personal
Between us, is there, or
Is that getting too personal?
I was devastated
When you lost.
But look at it this way:
It's just a little, bald,
Naked statue.
Just like you'll be one day.
Did he carve his telephone
Number in your butter patty?
Oh, go to hell!
What's this, Sidney--
A direct assault?
A frontal attack?
That's not like you, Sidney.
Wit and parry. Wit and parry--
That's more your style.
You make me sick!
When you can't have what you
Want, you make certain everyone
Around is equally miserable.
I hadn't noticed any equals.
You can throw up verbally as
Well as you can nutritionally.
Adam-- that was his name,
Wasn't it?
Adam, the first man.
Not very appropriate
For you, is it?
Diana, come off it.
We keep up a front for
Everyone else. Why can't we
Do it for ourselves?
You mean,
Lie to each other that we're
Perfectly well mated?
A closet couple--
Is that what you mean, Sidney?
I have never hidden
Behind closed doors,
But I am discreet.
"discreet"? ...
You did everything
But lick his artichoke.
Oh, please. Let's not have
A discretion contest.
I have heard about your
Lunch breaks on the set.
The only thing you don't do
In your dressing room is dress...
Now Ive lost count
Of my Librium.
If Im not up by 9:00,
I've overdosed.
Why is he Coming to England?
Who?
That boy. He said,
"see you in London next week."...
what's he doing in London?
- acting, of course.
He's making a film there.
what film? 
I don't follow Other people's films.
I barely follow yours.
[ sighs ]
Goddamn him! 
And goddamn you,
Goddamn the Oscars,
Goddamn California,
Goddamn everything!
What is it about this climate
That brings out
The religion in you?
Why don't you love me?
What film is that line from? ...
You bastard!
Answer the question.
Why don't you love me?
It didn't sound like a question.
I'm tired of Paying for everything
And getting nothing in return.
I thought Joe Pickman
Paid for everything.
If it wasn't for me,
You wouldn't be here tonight...
To have arranged to meet him
In London next week.
Why don't you
Love me anymore, Sidney?
I've never stopped loving you,
In my way.
[ sighs ]...
Your way doesn't do me
Any good.  
Diana, it is nearly
4:00 in the morning. 
Now is not A good time to discuss
Biological discrepancies.
faggot!
- oh, good. I thought
You'd never ask.
Don't turn away from me.
I'm so miserable, Sidney.
Don't do this to me.
Please.
I'm sorry. It hasn't been
A winning evening, has it?
Screw the Oscars.
Screw the academy awards...
- screw me, Sidney, please.
- Diana--
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
I don't want to put you
Off your game.
Diana,
I am always here for you.
My friendly filling station.
Why don't you stick to
Your own kind, Sidney?
If there's anything I hate,
It's a bisexual homosexual.
or is it The other way 'round?
it works either way.
Jesus god, Sidney,
I love you so much.  
- I know that, darling.
- why do you stay with me?
What do you get from me that
Could possibly satisfy you?
A wider circle of prospects.
I am a minor celebrity
Once removed. 
Sorry I didn't win
That award tonight.
Your dance card would have
Been filled for a year.
We haven't done
Too badly together.
I'm kinder to you
Than your average stuntman.
There was a time, Sidney, ...
When I thought you'd
Give it all up for me.
I love you, my angel,
More than any woman
I've ever known.  
Christ,
I can't get a break.
I do the best I can.
Thank you.
You can't say we don't
Have fun together.
Oh, hell, no.
The dinner conversations alone
Are worth the trouble.  
[ yawning ] Sorry.  
Sorry, Sidney.
It wasn't the kiss.
It's my life.
Tired? Come on, then.
Losing Oscars always
Does that to me.
I'll get up first thing
And order your eggs benedict.
You do take care of me, Sidney.
I'll say that.
And good help is
So hard to find these days.
You scratch my back,
And Ill scratch yours.
It's been an evening
Of ups and downs, hasn't it? ...
Mm-hmm.
Care to continue the motion? ...
Tacky.  
You're getting tacky,
My angel.
I love you, Sidney.
Don't close your eyes,
Sidney.    
I always close my eyes.
Not tonight.
Look at me tonight.
Let it be me... Tonight. 
- long!
- what?
Long. The serve was long.
You're half asleep.
How can you see
The serve was long?
I saw it with the half
That was awake.
Second serve.
I hope he knows something about
Orthopedics, 'cause he won't
Be able to walk after this.
Long! Double fault.
Love-fifteen. 
What? What?
How can you call
That ball long?
It's simple.
Like this: looooong!
Now, serve the ball.
Serve the ball, Willis.
We only have the court
For an hour.
After I serve you head for
The clubhouse, 'cause there's
Not gonna be any survivors.
- "long."
- you ready?
oh! Ooh!
- get a towel,
Somebody, quick!
God, Willis!
Jesus!
I'm sorry.
Does it hurt to massage it?
Honey, Im sorry. ...
It's okay. It's okay.
You all right?
Yeah, Im okay.
All right. Fault!
Second serve!
Let them have the room tonight,
Please. It's safer.
[ moaning ]
never again.  
Never again. Never. ...
Never.  
Oh, god. 
What are you doing here?
I thought you left.  
Hey, hey. Come on.
You can't stay here. ...
Wake up.
[ groans ]  
Ohhh.  
Oh.
10:45?
Jesus Christ, it's 10:45.
Hey, wake up. Wake up.
Don't you understand?  
It's 10:45.
Crazy. I must be crazy.
Hello? Hello, operator,
What time is it?  
10:45?
Why didn't you call me?
I left a wake-up call
For 8:00 this morning!
I did! I didn't?
Well, you should have
Called me anyway.
Hey, come on. Get up.
My wife could walk in
Any minute.
Hey!
What's wrong with you?
You deaf or something?
You all right?
What'd you do? You drank
An entire bottle of tequila
With my wife coming in?
Are you crazy?
Oh, god.
Oh, listen, listen.
You gotta sleep this off
Someplace else. This is
A bad place to sleep this off.
Water.
How 'bout some nice water?
Here, lady.
Sip a little water.
Drink, sweetheart,
For my sake.
Open your lips,
You crazy broad! ...
[ breathing deeply ] 
Don't panic.
Panic is the quickest way
To divorce.
Don't panic.
Mustn't panic!  
Move. Move! 
Please, god, make her move.
I'll never be a bad person
Again, I promise.
All right.
We're going to get you dressed
And down into a cab.
That's it. 
I'm really sorry
This happened.
It was a wonderful evening,
Whoever the hell you are. ...
Come on, darling.
Push.  
Get your leg in there.
Get your foot in there
And push.
Come on! Come on.
Push, darling, push.
Get your feet--
Feet in here.
Come on!
Damn it, push!
Legs up, and push.  
[ mock sobbing ]
Get the foot in. Come on...
Come on!  
You're not gonna
Help me, right? 
Think, think, Marvin.
Think, think.  
[ sighs ]
Change rooms. 
Let some other idiot
Get stuck with her.
Hello, operator?
Get me the front desk, please.
This is an emergency.
Listen, I have two wonderful
Children who need a father.
Don't do this to me.
Hello, this is Mr. Michaels
In suite 203 and 4.
Listen, Im very
Uncomfortable in this room.
The bed is very bad for my back.
When I woke up this morning,
I thought my life was over.
[ chuckles ]
Well, we don't have
Another vacancy
Until 2:00 this afternoon.
One moment, Mr. Michaels.
May I help you, ma'am?
Marvin Michaels.
I'm Mrs. Marvin Michaels.
He's on the phone now.
Suite 203.
Thank you. Would you
Tell him Ill be right up?
Mr. Michaels, as I was saying,
We can have a...
Very nice suite for you
Sometime after 2:00.
I can't wait until 2:00.
My wife is coming in
From the east any minute now,
And I know she's not gonna be
Happy once she sees this room.
Who's here? My wife?  
My wife is here?
You sent my wife up here
Without calling me? 
What the hell kind Of a cheap hotel
Are you running here?
Well, send somebody to stop her
Before she sees this bed!
It could ruin
Her entire vacation!
I could jump.
With two broken legs,
She'd never be angry with me.
[ door buzzer ]
oh, my god. 
- Marvin?
- oh, god. 
Oh, my god.  
Marvin? Hello? 
[ knocking on door ] ...
Marvin?  ...
Open the door!
Just a minute!
what are you doing, ...
rearranging the furniture? ...
open the door! 
I'm going into the other room.
Once Im in there,
Lock this door
And don't open it for anyone!...
what? 
I cannot hear you. ...
[ door buzzer ]
who is it?  
it's me, Millie. 
Millie?   
yes! 
just a minute!   
Millie?
Hello, Marvin.
Thank you for opening the door.
Hello, sweetie.
Why didn't you pick me up
At the airport?  
Why?
Yes, why?
Why.
I've been sick all day...
I just threw up In the other room.
Don't go in there.
The doctor left
About ten minutes ago...
I have acute
Gastroenteritis. ...
but it's nothing To worry about.
oh, my god!
When did this happen?
About 2:00 in the morning.
You look terrible.
Why don't you get into bed,
Honey. You'll feel better.
Come on, you'll be more--
Oh, no! Oh, no!
I'm not supposed to lie down.
It makes me nauseous.
It just makes me nauseous.
Honey-- okay.
Oh, you're so sweet.
[ kissing ] 
I feel much better In this room.
It's so much cheerier.
I think you better lie down.
[ gagging ] ...
I need
Some compazine spansules.
What's that?
Aah! It stops nausea...
Compazine spansules.
Did you call downstairs
To the drugstore?
They don't carry it.
It has codeine in it. 
The nearest place
That has it is a drugstore
On Santa Monica Blvd.
But they don't deliver.
I'm gonna have to go
Down there myself.
All right, Ill go.
I'll go.  
Where's the prescription?
What prescription?
Didn't the doctor give you
A prescription? You can't get
Codeine without a prescription.
Yes, you can.
In California, you can.
Compazine spansules.
Well, then--
I have to go to the bathroom.
Now?
well, I haven't gone...
in four hours. 
I told you,
I just threw up in there,
All over.
Please, give me the opportunity
Of making it presentable first...
It means a great deal to me.
We've been married for 15 years.
You've never cleaned up
A bathroom before.
Well, I think it's
High time I started.
Don't you?
Please.
I'll be right out...
Sit down for a minute.
No, please, no--
Here, have a piece of fruit.
Go to the bathroom if you're
Gonna clean up, okay?
I'm sorry, miss. 
I'm gonna have to leave you
Out in the hall.
Don't worry about it. ...
They'll take care of you.
They have
Very good service here.
Mr. Michaels?
Oh, Christ!
D-don't ever do that!  
I'm sorry.
I was just bringing up
Mrs. Michael's bag.
Oh, good.
They found your bag, honey.
She was very worried about it.
She was just going down
To look for it.
You want it in the bedroom?
No!
Um, yes.
No, leave it there. 
In the hall?
Uh, yes. Uh, no.
Um, give it to me.
No, uh, put it in the bedroom.
Is Mrs. Michaels all right?
Yes, she's very tired.
She just flew in from New York.
Thank you very much.
Uh, Ill
Take care of you later.  
[ grunts ]
Marvin,
Why is the door locked?
I can't hear you!
I'm in the bathroom, cleaning!...
I can't wait anymore.
Open the door. 
I'll open the door.
Here comes the door!
Marvin!   
The opening of the door
Is coming!
What are you doing?
I'm on the way to the door...
The door is open.
Don't you know how
To work a door?
What took you so long?
What's the matter?
You got a girl in here?
That's right!
I have a beautiful blonde
In the bed!
I smell perfume--
Women's perfume.
They spray it in all the rooms.
It's a terrific hotel.  
Oh.
[ sighs ]
My god,
I'm never gonna make it.
Feel better, sugar pie?
I've got circles under my eyes.
I didn't sleep all night. 
I've gotta take a nap.
A nap? Why do you want
To take a nap?
You can nap at the bar mitzvah.
You know how boring they are.
We're never gonna get there
If I don't have
A few minutes' rest.
Come on, move over.
Wait--
Millie, would you
Sit down for a minute?
I have to tell you something.
Can't I lie down and hear it?
It's the kind of thing
You should hear sitting up.
Millie,
You mean more to me
Than you could possibly know. ...
But sometimes we transgress.
Sometimes we do foolish things
Which unwittingly...
Cause hurt and injury
To the other.
I don't think you've ever
Consciously hurt me.
Consciously, no. ...
But a careless word here,
A foolish gesture... There--
Nothing major, Marvin.
We've had disagreements,
But nothing major.
I'm glad you
Brought that up, Millie.
What would you consider major?
Major? I don't know.
I-I can't picture you
Doing anything major.
I-I guess if you were
Cruel to the children,
That would be major.
I would put that number one.
I would say that
That was the worst thing
A man could do in a marriage.
To be cruel to the children
Is unpardonable.
All else could be forgiven.
If I caught you
With another woman,
That would be major.
Let's not get off
The children thing so fast...
To me, children are
The reflection--
Marvin, Marvin,
I've got to lie down.
Oh, Millie,
I've missed you so.
Mm-mm-mm. Oh.
I've missed you. ...
So-- Let's go to the living room.
God, Ive missed you.
Let's make love In the living room.
You've missed me?
You've only been away one night.
I know, but there's
A three-hour time difference.
My god, Ive never
Seen you look so pretty.
Come here,
You cute little thing.
Don't be ridiculous.
There's not even a bed in here...
Oh. Oh, well.
They-- they have
Terrific carpeting.
Come on.
We tried pot last year.
Let's try carpeting this year.
Maybe tonight.
If I don't lie down,
I'll pass out.
Millie! Millie, wait!
Millie, don't! Millie!
You don't Have to get so upset.
I said tonight.
I've never seen you So sex-crazed
In the morning.
I didn't realize
It was the morning. 
Why don't you just
Lie down next to me
And relax?
We don't have to make love...
Just lie down next to me
For-- for half an hour...
Come on. You can
Do that, can't you?
[ whimpering ]...
Come on. ...
[ continues whimpering ] ...
what are you doing Down there?
my back is acting up again.
the bed is too soft.
- I don't believe that
For a second.
Millie,
I can't keep this up anymore.
I'm gonna get a heart attack.
I'm gonna tell you something,
Millie, and this is the truth...
No more lies.
It was never my intention
To hurt you, Millie,
But it's very possible
That in the next few minutes.....
You may be terribly,
Terribly hurt. 
Uh-huh.
Is it major or minor?
To me it's minor.
To you I think it's going to be
Extremely major.
Well, tell me, Marvin.
It couldn't be that bad,
As long as you're not
Trying to cover up something.
I'd like to show you something,
Millie, but Im gonna ask you
To do something for me first.
Say nothing for ten seconds.
Whatever comes to mind, please,
For the sake of both of us,
Say nothing for ten seconds. ...
I'm praying, Marvin.
I'm praying that the maid
Came in to clean...  
And got dizzy from overwork
And fainted in your bed?
It's not the maid, Millie.
Well, then,
I'm very anxious to hear
Who it is, Marvin.
I can't wait to hear
What you have to say next...
I'm waiting, Marvin.
I'm waiting too.  
You know what my guess is?...
My guess is that that's
A woman in your bed.
That's my guess too, Millie.
What woman,
You can tell me in court. ...
I'm leaving now, Marvin.
Before I go,
I want to ask you
One silly question.
- why doesn't she move?
- I can explain that. 
Don't tell me
You've been carrying on
With a helpless paralytic.
I won't buy it, Marvin...
Millie, she drank
A whole bottle of tequila
By herself!
Set and match point
Coming up.  
watch it!
- like I watched the gauge? ...
It's mine!
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Look out.
Chauncey, lob it! 
I got it.
- I got it, I got it, I got it...
I got it, I got it.
Willis, I got it.
ooh, I got it. Watch it!
Oh!  
ow!    
Ooh. Ooh! It's broken.
Oh, god. It's broken.
I can feel it.
It's not broken. It's sprained.
You're a nose and throat man.
How do you know?
We were dead drunk,
The both of us.
You think Id do something
Like that stone sober?
Let me tell you something else.
Being cruel to the children is
Number two. that's
number one.
To you, Millie.
I can understand it being
Important to you.
To me it was meaningless.
That's a shame, Marvin.
I always get so upset when
You don't have a good time.
good, good. Get it out.  ...
The quicker you get it out,
The quicker you'll be
Rid of it.
God.
And what do I do now?
Do you expect me to go
To your nephew's bar mitzvah...
And say "congratulations"
To the man who paid that woman
To sleep with my husband?
He'll probably wink at you.
He doesn't know
That you know.
I see.
Well, then the joke's on him.
Only you and I know that I know.
You're right, Millie.
You don't deserve to be
Treated like that.
Forget the bar mitzvah. I'll go
Back with you on the next plane
If that's what you want.
No. I will not give
You or your family
That satisfaction.
I am going to behave
With more dignity
Than you ever dreamed.
I am going to that bar mitzvah
With my head held high.
I am not going to divorce you.
I am going to forgive you.
I am going to forget
This ever happened. I am going
To figure out why it happened,
And Im never going
To bring it up again
As long as I live.
And now, Im going in there,
And Im going to spend
Every last cent you have.
Here we go, dear. Here we go.
To the right. To the right. ...
Oh, I feel like a piano--
A dead piano.
All right.
Lola, please get a wet towel
Out of our bathroom.
[ moaning ] You mean,
This is all your room?
Huh? I slept standing up,
And you're living like
The king and queen of England?
The queen is about to
Abdicate her leg
If we don't get her into bed.
Lola! Lola, I want you
To see what they got--...
[ yells ] Oh, god.
[ glass shatters ]...
What happened, damn it?
Oh.
[ clears throat ]...
I broke a bottle of perfume.
I'm sorry, Bett.
Don't worry.
It was only $90 an ounce. ...
Of all the stupid-ass Things to do--
Hold on.
She did not do it on purpose.
You mean it was
A planned accident?
We don't have to take this crap.
We can go up to our cigar box
And watch our broken television.
come on, honey. 
ow! Oh, I cut my finger. 
It's bleeding.
Oh, damn, that perfume burns!...
Only good perfume.
Cheap perfume
You can't feel at all.
Oh, Bett, there's broken glass
On the bathroom floor.
Be careful where you step.
I'm glad you told me.
I was gonna walk in there
A lot today.
[ Chauncey ] Willis, do you have
Any band-aids?
[ Willis ] we'll take care
Of one casualty at a time.
[ yelling ]...
Grab her! 
Oh! Ohh!
[ window shattering ] ...
Oh, my leg!
All right, all right. ...
will you please help us? 
now you want my help, huh?
Ohh!
Watch the step. 
Ouch! Oh, help me.
Oh, help me, somebody.
Lola, what's-- My head. 
I banged my head
On the medicine cabinet.
I'm gonna pass out.
No, you're not.
I am. I'm passing out...
Lola, don't pass--
Lola. Lola.
My god. Would you get me
A wet towel? She passed out!
Lola. Lola, sweetheart,
You're gonna be all right, baby.
Don't lie to the woman.
She knows she's not okay.
Lola! Lola!
Lola, you're bleeding
On the man's rug.
He'll charge me for it.
Lola? Lola.
[ glass crunching ]
Lola, listen to me.
Lola? Lola?
How many fingers?
Lola. Lola? Lola? Lola?
I just stepped on
A broken piece of glass,
And I hope you're satisfied. ...
That feel better?
No, that's the wrong ankle.
Would you help me lift her
To the bed, please?
Only on vacations.
This only happens on vacations.
Grab her feet. Oop!
God, it's like Guadalcanal in here.
Oh, easy! Easy!
Easy! Oh, ouch.
Ow! Oh, careful.
Hey! Ow!
Wait a minute!
Ow!
Ohh! 
[ groaning ] You're all right. ...
This bed is bigger
Than our whole room.
Let's settle up!
What?
How much do I owe you, huh?
Because after I pay you,
I ain't gonna see you.  
All right. All right.
Now, let's not get
Our noses bent outta shape.
It's all over.
Let's forget it.
Forget it?
Forget it.
Forget it? Forget the year
I planned for this vacation?
You know what I got
To show for it?
An overdose of Japanese food,
Mildew in my feet
From sleeping in a wet bed,
A wife with a concussion,
Two lawsuits for two car crashes
That I didn't drive two times!
And you want me to forget it?
Ha!
I'm writing a blank check.
You fill it out
And shove it up your--
No!
Hey, hey, hey!  
You don't use that language
In front of the ladies.
The ladies are unconscious.
They can't hear us.
Now, I owe you for
A bottle of perfume,
Bloodstains on the rug,
And an acetylene torch
That burned us out of the car.
I've had it!
Ah-ah-ah.
I want to go home.
I need a vacation!
Now, come on, buddy.
Now, look, let's shake-- ...
Let's shake, and let's
Forget it ever happened.
Oh, shake hands with the man,
Chauncey, please.
[ screams ]...
Watch what you're doing,
Idiot!
"idiot"? That's the hump
That broke the camel's back!
Aah!
Either you apologize
To my dear, sweet wife
For calling her an idiot,
Or Ill take this
Japanese aluminum racket
And Ill backhand you to death!
Don't threaten me.
Never threaten a man
Who's spent two years working
The drunk ward. Now, back off!
Apologize to my wife
By the time I count to five,
Or Im gonna start serving
With your big head.  
one!
- don't fight.
Please don't fight.
two.
- somebody'll get hurt
And fall on me.
three.
- don't hit him with the racket.
I just had it restrung!
Four!
And you know what comes
After four, don't you?
I'll mess you up so bad,
Even I won't be able
To fix you up.
Apologize
Before I get to five!
Say it.
Go ahead, say it.
Say it.
Are you afraid to say it?
Say "five." five.
I'll say it for you.
Five! Five! Five!
Say it!
It don't count Unless I say it.
Five!
[ yelling ]
Thank god their patients
Aren't here to see this. 
Millie.
No word
From sleeping beauty?
Oh, thanks.
Thank you very much.
Forget about her.
We'll get dressed,
Go to the bar mitzvah.
And tonight,
We'll move to another hotel.
May we do that, Millie?
I wonder if harry
Spent as much on her
As we did on his lousy kid.
Millie, Ill never do
Anything again to hurt you
As long as I live.
You're the most special woman
In the world to me, Millie,
And I love you.
I love you, Millie.
Please,
Not in front of the hooker.
Oh, god, get him off of me!
Chauncey, don't bite.
You'll ruin your caps!
Get him off of me!
Get him off of me!
I've had enough of you.
Don't you ever bite me again.
Do you know you could
Give me a blood disease?
Now, tell me we're friends!
Now you say...
That you enjoyed the vacation--
Say it!
Friends!
You're going to tell me
That you enjoyed--
Friends!
Friends! Now!
Friends!
You tell me that you enjoyed
Being with us on our vacation!
Best time Ive ever had! 
You better believe it.
[ yelling ]
Call your wife off.
Get off! Get off!
Get off! Get off!
[ all yelling ]  
Did you love the Japanese
Restaurant? Say it!
Huh? Say it!
[ gagging ] 
Say it!
Willis! ...
And you say...
That you are going...
To love...
Going with us next year
On a vacation again. 
say it!
- you can crack my ribs,
But I won't say it.
You like it?
Mildred, you look beautiful. ...
Yeah?
Thank you.
Beautiful.
Come on, darling. There's
A cab waiting 20 minutes.
What happened to our roommate?
She's gone.
She couldn't find her shoes.
I gave her yours.
Anything to get rid of her.
[ chuckling ]
Hey, wait. What are you doing?
Hey, you're giving away my cab.
I asked you to hold that.
I'm sorry, sir.
I couldn't hold it any longer.
For cryin' out loud. Will you
Get me another one, please?
It'll take about 20 minutes.
we're gonna be late.
I knew it.
hi.
can I give you a lift?
- no, thank you. We'll wait. ...
That's very nice of you.
Get in the cab, Marvin.
Are you serious?
I didn't come 3,000 miles
To be late.
Get in the cab, Marvin.
Do you know who that is?
Yes, it's our hooker. ...
You think Id ride
With strangers? ...
this is very nice of you. 
thank you. ...
oh, my pleasure. ...
Nice shoes.
Thank you...
Live out here?
Sometimes.
Passengers holding
A blue boarding pass may
Enter the aircraft at gate 37-a.
Thank you.
Mother! Whew!
I was afraid I wouldn't make it.
What are you doing here?
Where's your father? ...
My god.
Was it the lima beans
And broccoli?
No, no. He's waiting
Outside in the car.
I just wanted to say
Good-bye and thank you.
And I love you.
You don't know
What this means to me.
I've been very depressed.
I just found out
I've already seen the movie.
I'm gonna miss you, mother,
But I know Im doing the--
No, no, jenny.
Don't say it.
It's all right.
I'm doing the right thing.
There. I said it anyways.
This is for you.  
What is that?
It's a map
Of the movie stars' homes,
Just in case you ever
Make it out this way again.
Sir, Im sorry about
Dropping that suitcase.
Oh, that's all right.
It wasn't the foot
With the glass in it.
Tell the hostess I have to sit with
My good eye near the window.
I don't want to miss
The grand canyon again...
[ raspy ] How can I lecture
And operate on Monday?
I can't speak,
And I can't look down...
[ stewardess ] good afternoon,
Ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome aboard flight 211...
To New York and London.
Our flying time
This afternoon will be
Four hours and fifty minutes,
And we'll be cruising
At an altitude of 37,000 feet...
We'll now be serving you
Cocktails and beverages
And then serving lunch,
Followed by our film,
No left turn, starring
James Coburn and Diana Barrie.
Oh, Christ, Sidney,
Let's get off. Tell them
To let us off this bloody plane.
