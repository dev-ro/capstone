Aah!
Cut.
Thank you
very much, renee.
I'm sorry.
He grabbed me.
I'm sorry.
He keeps missing my arms.
Why don't we give this up?
Frank,
i can't see anything
down there.
I'm working blind.
Okay, okay.
Sorry, renee.
Tell me the truth--
you get off on seeing me suffer,
don't you?
Ahh, water everywhere.
Can i get a cigarette?
You're going to
soak the set.
Can you hit
your mark this time?
It's not a matter
of marks.
There's not a damn thing
down there to see.
Okay, look,
i need this.
Jeff?
Right here, mom.
Hey...
how long
have you been here?
A couple minutes.
How was your weekend
with your father?
Good.
H-he wants to come down
to the set for dinner
if it's all right.
I mean...
what i'm really trying to say is,
he misses you.
Dinner would be great.
I just don't want you
getting your hopes up, okay?
We're trying to work
things out, but--
i know, mom.
Okay, people.
Quiet.
Final touches.
Now's the time.
I think
it's showtime.
Jeff?
I love you.
Roll, please.
Eight camera
rolling.
Castle of terror,
scene 13, take 33.
Okay action, renee.
Ooh!
Aah!
Cut!
For christ's sake, cut!
There's a dead short!
We've lost the neutral!
Cut the power!
Cut the power!
Aah!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
I know this
is hard for you,
but i thinkyou've made
the right decision.
He was
a very old dog.
He had
a good life.
Dr. Matthews,
your son is on line one.
He says it's an emergency.
Can you take it?
Excuse me.
Yeah, jeff.
What's going on?
I am the resurrection and
the life, sayeth the lord.
She who believeth in me,
though she were dead,
yet she shall live.
Whosoever liveth
and believeth in me
will never die.
I know my redeemer liveth,
and that he shall stand
until the latter day
upon the earth.
Friends, let us
bow our heads
in silent prayer.
Being lowered...
friends, uh, our service
is now concluded.
Here we go.
Come on, folks.
Let's keep it back.
Show a little
respect, now.
Keep it back there.
I know
it's a difficult--
obviously you boys
didn't hear me.
Show a little respect.
You probably don't
remember me, chase.
I'm gus gilbert,
town sheriff.
I remember you.
I hear you're moving
into the summerhouse.
You plan
on staying full-time?
Just wanted to get
my son jeff out of l.a.,
start things over.
Yeah.
Well, deepest regrets.
Thank you.
We got six of these
big wardrobe boxes.
Sure you want them all
in the attic?
Jeff, why not give
the clothes to goodwill?
We'll keep the rest.
Just the clothes.
You're the one
who wanted to move.
All the renee boxes--
in the attic.
Hi.
Um, i'm marjorie hargrove,
your new housekeeper.
Hi.
Uh...
is something wrong?
No. Uh, you just
look different
than you sounded
on the phone.
Please, come in.
I'm real excited to be working for you,
mr. Matthews.
Well, we're glad
to have you, marjorie.
This is my son jeff.
You can call me chase,
okay?
You know,
i-i adored
mrs. Hallow.
That one goes up
in the attic.
Say what, john?
Look out! Look out!
Oh, i'll get that.
Ohh, this is gorgeous.
This is what she wore
at the emmys, isn't it?
Hey, don't touch
her stuff.
It made her crazy when
people touched her stuff.
I'm--i'm sorry.
It's okay.
Hey, wait up.
I'm coming with.
That's great.
I can sure use
your help.
Ha ha! Come on!
Right behind you.
This isn't too bad.
It's, uh, pretty bad.
God, how long ago
did this guy retire?
It's been a few years.
A few?
What's down there?
I think kennels
are in the back.
Aah!
What happened?
You all right?
Yeah.
I'm all right.
I just got spooked
by a bunch of fur balls.
Oh, great.
Now i've opened up
an orphanage, too?
Well...
if it's okay,
i'd like
to take one.
All right,
i'll tell you what.
You clean up
these old kennels,
and, uh...
she's yours.
All right.
Thanks, dad.
Come on, you guys.
No, zowie!
Zowie, come back!
Zowie!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey...
drew, you get
a handle on that dog.
Sorry. He gets
kind of hyper.
That's all right.
He thought
it was lunch.
Hi, chase.
You met my boy?
No.
Drew, where are
your manners?
He's
a cool-looking dog.
What's his name?
Zowie.
Zowie.
Hey, what happened there,
zowie?
Damn dog stuck his nose
in on my rabbits.
They ganged up on him.
That dog's dumber
than lobster bait.
Is he going
to be okay?
I'm not really
set up yet,
but i'll take
a quick look.
Come on, pal. It's okay, boy.
Up on the table.
Oh, good boy.
Good boy.
Let me look
at you here.
When i was younger,
i thought cats were girls
and dogs were boys.
There's three more girls
where that one came from
looking for homes.
Not our home.
Facial lacerations.
They'll heal up
pretty quickly.
I'll give you some antibiotic
ointment for that.
Drew,
you listening?
It's your dog.
He has corneal abrasions--
scratches on the surface
of his right eye.
These eye drops
will help,
but it'll still
take some time,
so try to keep him
away from those rabbits.
Thanks.
Hey, jeff,
you know your mother and i
used to be sweethearts?
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Prom, homecoming...
whole nine yards.
Of course,
that was a lifetime ago.
* I'll tell you why *
* everything looks different
in my eyes *
* no need to lie *
* i know everything
'cause i've got spies *
check it out.
* Have you lost
your mind? *
Celebrity boy.
* It's all in the papers
that you signed *
* on the dotted line *
take your seats and settle down, please.
* Everything looks different,
i'm not blind *
* i've got spies... **
hey, what's
hollywood like?
Excuse me.
In the back,
would yousettledown,
please?
Hey, wait up.
I don't know
what i would have done.
What's the hurry,
junior?
Where you off to?
Sorry about
your mom, huh?
Paper said
it was pretty gross
getting fried
like that.
Who you got there?
You're supposed to
introduce your friends.
Yeah. What's the
cat's name, junior?
Tiger.
Tiger.
Don't you think
that's kind of
a pussy name?
Can i hold her?
Promise i'll be
real careful.
Hey, jeff,
have you ever seen
a kitten run before?
Yeah.
I mean really run...
like this.
Shit.
You having fun yet?
Give me the cat,
all right?
I would, but, uh...
there was
a little accident.
She was trying
to get away,
and her head got caught
in the spokes.
What's left of her
is back in the pet cemetery.
Heard about the
creed murders yet?
Heard about the place
where the dead rise?
Just back there, jeff.
Just down that path.
Come on, clyde.
Tell him
where the cat is.
I told him
where the cat is.
Shut up, dick-wad.
What are you
going to do, fat ass?
You going to sic big,
bad old gus on me?
What do you think, jeff?
Maybe you can
dig up your old lady,
bury her back there.
And maybe if you
pray real hard,
maybe she'll come back.
Punk.
You got him good.
Asshole.
This way, fat boy.
Showed him, huh?
There you go.
I've never seen anybody
punch clyde before.
He pissed me off.
Sorry about your mom.
She sure was beautiful.
You never really think your
parents are going to die.
Sometimes...
i wish
gus would die.
You shouldn't say that
about your dad.
Stepdad.
Gus is my stepdad.
So...
what was all that stuff about
people coming back to life?
Nothing.
It's just
an old ghost story.
Hey...
let's get
out of here.
I agree.
There you go.
Oh, damn it.
Thank you.
Hey, how was
school today?
It sucked.
Hey, the first day of school
is always the hardest.
You're not
my mother.
Jeff...
jeff?
Live action resumes
at the cumberland county
civic center
this friday evening...
drew, i don't remember
inviting zowie in for dinner.
Just until he heals up?
Don't start with me.
Hi, beautiful.
Oh, god.
Oh, gus.
Hi.
Gus...
stop it.
You're breaking the law.
Turn it off.
Your mother spent
the last hour cooking.
Show her
some appreciation.
Really, gus,
it doesn't bother me.
That a boy.
There you go.
Not that much
appreciation.
Now, i thought
we were going to tone down
on your flabby ass.
Hey, i'm so sorry i'm not the stud you are.
Okay, knock it off, guys.
You better watch your mouth, drew, buddy.
I'll take that hey
and shove it right
back down your throat.
You understand?
Where's your boyfriend?
I don't know.
Don't lie to me.
Jeff.
I'll give you
one more chance.
Jeff.
What?
Are you all right?
Do you think mom and you
would've gotten back together?
I-i think so.
I still can't believe
she's dead.
Goddamn it.
Goddamn it.
Goddamn dog.
That dog is history.
Goddamn it.
You hear me, boy?
Goddamn it.
Don't shoot him.
What, drew?
What did you say?
Gus, what have you done?
Come on, amanda,
stop looking at me like that.
He's had ample warning
about that dog.
Zowie?
* Where are you now? *
Zowie.
* It can't be here *
* i look into your eyes *
* and i see nothing there *
* i hear you fading away *
* who do i tell? *
* What can i do? *
* Your soul
is lost somewhere *
* i can't find me there, too *
* i feel you fading away *
* i feel you fading away *
* i want to scream *
* i want to run away *
* i want to tear
this world apart *
* i want to cry *
* i need somewhere
to hide *
* the only place i know *
* is the place inside
your heart... **
i was just going
by your house.
Where's your bike?
Zowie's dead.
I have to bury him.
I don't want to
go out there alone.
All right.
I'll go get
a shovel, okay?
So where do you want
to bury him?
I'm not going
to bury him here.
Then why are we here?
There's a better place.
It's back there somewhere,
through the bog.
Come on.
It's supposed to
be up there.
What is?
The old indian
burial ground.
Drew, come on, that's
an old bullshit story.
You said so yourself.
What if it's
not bullshit?
If i bury zowie there
and it works,
he'll come back...
alive.
I know your dog died,
but get a grip.
You're freaking me out.
If there was even one chance
in a million it would work,
wouldn't you
just want to try?
Look, let's just get
this over with, okay?
If this doesn't work,
you can't ever tell
anyone i did this, okay?
You got to promise.
Well... you need any help?
You have to bury
your own.
That's the way
the indians did it.
It's like a rule.
I never had anyone
die before.
But i guess
you get over it.
I mean, eventually.
No.
No, you never get over it.
Look, maybe we should
get out of here, huh?
Yeah.
So long, zowie.
Want to get in?
Your mama's worried
sick about you.
You take off in
the middle of the night.
You don't show up
for school.
What are you trying
to prove?
I'm not trying
to prove anything.
I was burying my dog.
Life is full
of lessons, buddy.
No one's above them--
not you, not me.
Now get in the car.
Zowie?
Drew, you unlock
this door right now.
Unlock it, drew.
What did i do now?
Open this door,
drew gilbert.
Where do you come off lying like that?
"I buried my dog."
You think a lie
like that
is never going
to catch up to you?
Zowie.
You say your good-byes,
mister.
Zowie's going outside,
and you are grounded.
That's the new law,
buddy.
Drew, honey, i'm going
to call the vet.
Hey, drew.
Jeff, why don't you
give him a hand, huh?
Hey. Hey, zowie.
Let's go up here,
pal.
There you go.
Lie down. Lie down.
There you go, boy.
There you go.
How did it happen?
Some psycho
got trigger-happy.
I'm going to give him
a local anesthetic
so i can clean up
the wound.
I'd like to take him home
tonight for observation.
Can you keep him at your
place until he gets better?
Yeah. Sure.
Come on.
Listen, maybe he wasn't dead
when we buried him.
He was dead.
You know he was.
Jeff.
Mom!
I'm waiting for you.
Aah!
Mom!
Is he going
to be okay?
I don't know.
It's been
three days.
His immune system should
have responded by now.
Shh. It's okay
i'm not getting
a heartbeat.
He must be so weak,
it's just not registering.
Jeff, let's take
some blood, huh?
Yeah. There you go.
Good boy.
Good boy.
Listen, why doesn't
he have a heartbeat?
Maybe it takes a while.
Grrr! Aah!
Ohh!
Happy halloween,
dr. Matthews.
Trick or treat.
Okay, guys,
take it easy.
Evening, gus.
Evening, ralph.
These your girls?
Sure are.
Happy halloween!
Trick or treat!
Behave yourself.
Have a good night.
Come on, girls. Bye.
Go to the next one on your own.
Okay wait. Wait.
No. Just hold still.
Hold still.
Hold still.
Just make sure
you're home by 10:00.
If gus finds out
i let you go...
i will drink his blood.
Don't worry, mom.
I'll be home.
Where is everybody?
Aah!
Jeff, honey,
mommy's here.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Look at this...
junior here practically
shit his pants.
Check his shorts.
Oh, no!
Mommy's here, jeff.
Ha ha ha!
Are you going to run
home to daddy now?
Fuck off.
Ooh.
Ooh.
What a blast.
Did you see the look
on his face?
You're home early.
No. Just ran out
of smokes.
Lucky me.
Where's the boy?
In his room.
Drew?
Goddamn it, amanda.
You want me to be
father to that boy,
and every time
i lay down the law,
you let him
break it.
Where is he?
Where is your son?
Pet cemetery.
What?
Pet cemetery.
Yeah. That old louis
was one sick puppy--
digging up little gage.
Maggots pouring out
of the dead kid's eyes.
Ellie creed was
the only one that lived.
And then one night...
she freaks out,
hacks up the grandparents
with an ax.
Whoa.
Police found her licking
the brains off the blade.
Threw her
in the psycho ward.
All she could say
were two words--
pet cemetery.
Here's the best part.
Two nights ago,
she escapes.
Man, i hope she doesn't
show up here.
Shit,
we wouldn't even
recognize her.
Not if she was wearing
a costume.
She could be one of us.
Oh, my god!
What?
What?
Aw, shit!
It's drew's dad.
It's gus.
He's going
to kick my ass.
You boys better not
be drinking.
Drew, get your ass out here,
front and center.
Thanks for screwing up
our halloween, dumb shit.
You get out of here,
jeff matthews.
This is between
me and my boy.
I warned you, buddy.
You broke the law,
now you have to learn the lesson.
Zowie!
No, zowie, stop!
Drew, call him off!
No, zowie!
Call off your dog!
Drew, call him off!
Drew!
Is he dead?
Oh, man, jeff...
we killed him.
Are you sure?
What are we
going to do?
We can bring him back.
We can, can't we?
It worked on zowie.
All right.
Oh, god.
Drew... do you know
what time it is?
Did gus ever find you?
God,
what happened to you?
Nothing happened, mom.
We just ditched gus.
That's all.
You been drinking?
Drew's mom
called hours ago.
The other kids
were back by 10:00.
Where the hell
were you boys?
Just out.
Just out?
Hold it!
I've been letting you
get away with a lot
these past few weeks,
but i will not stand
for crap like this.
I don't care if it's halloween.
It's a school night.
Don't you ever
do this again!
Dad, listen. I'm really,
really tired,
and i just
want to go to bed.
Go on.
We'll talk about this
in the morning.
All right.
Ha ha ha ha!
Drew...
drew, buddy.
Lost my keys.
Gus?
Found them.
I need a shower.
Ugh.
Ha ha ha ha!
Honey...
i'm sorry about tonight.
Please come to bed.
Aah! You're cold as ice.
Oh, you smell bad.
What did you
get yourself into?
Oh, my god, gus.
What happened--
gus! Stop it!
What are you doing?
Stop it!
Gus, let go of me!
What's wrong with you,
gus? Stop it!
Let go of me! Gus!
Well?
Picture this.
Gus comes
down to breakfast,
and he doesn't
say a word.
He even
kind of smiles,
like he forgot
he hates me,
and then you know
what he does?
He serves me an extra helping of pancakes.
I asked him if i was
still grounded.
"No."
I asked him if you could stay over tonight,
and-and he nods.
It's like
we're family,
a real family.
Chase, this is
elliot rudman.
I looked over the blood specimen
you sent me on canine zowie.
Give me a call.
Are you open?
Yeah, yeah.
Come on in.
We saw your sign.
Do you have
any kitties left?
Uh, yeah. You can
take your pick.
They're back in
the boarding area.
You can go on back.
Right through there.
Ready? Let's go.
Hello?
Rudman, it's matthews.
Matthews,
was it your idea of a joke
to send me blood
from a dead animal?
I didn't get that.
I said next time
it might be a good idea
if you take a blood sample
while the animal
is still alive.
Can you just give me
the lymphocyte count?
It's normal.
There's nothing here
to indicate
that the animal died
from an immune deficiency.
Died, died.
There's some kind of mix-up here.
This dog is alive.
Not this dog.
The cells are
completely deteriorated.
You took over
for yolander, right?
Yeah. Why?
The last person
that sent me blood
from a dead animal
was yolander.
This is not blood from a dead animal, rudman.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Oh, my god!
What happened?
Huh? What happened?
Jesus!
Oh, no.
Hey!
How's it going, losers?
Jeff!
Drew!
Saved by the bell.
His dad has to come
and bail them out.
Can i spend the night over
at drew's house tonight?
Yeah, yeah. That's fine.
Listen, guys, i got
the test back on zowie.
He's not well.
Don't ask me how,
but he's gotten out.
So if he finds
his way home, call me.
Whatever hour, okay?
Sure, dad.
Yeah.
All right.
See ya.
You would be so much
more interesting with...
blue eyes.
State your business!
Dr. Yolander,
i'm chase matthews.
I just took over
your offices in ludlow.
I sent out a blood sample
for analysis,
and they told me that the
blood was from a dead animal.
You might as well
come in.
Why are you
bothering me with this?
Can't you
just let it be?
The pathologist,
he said that you had a similar incident
with a cat.
The creed cat.
That's right.
Bastard's name
was...
church.
Let me guess.
Your dog's tissue
isn't healing,
uh, pupils aren't
dilating,
maybe you can't find
a heartbeat.
Exactly. I thought it was
some kind of blood condition,
but i--
there's no
blood condition.
The dog isn't sick.
It's dead...
and so was creed's cat.
And so was his wife...
on the night she was
killed for the second time.
You want some advice,
my friend?
You get in your car,
and you get the hell
out of that town!
Ha ha ha!
Ho ho ho ho!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
* When i get mad *
* and i get pissed *
* i grab my pen,
and i write out a list *

This isn't funny.
Where's your boyfriend?
I don't know.
Don't lie to me.
I'm going to give you
one more chance.
I don't know.
Aah!
* Time *

Oh!
Aah!
Oh, god!
No!
Do you think everybody that came
back would be like your stepdad?
I don't know.
Maybe it depends
on what you were like.
Before you died?
See you at school
monday?
Yeah, sure.
Hey, jeff,
do you ever think about running away?
All the time.
See ya, man.
Shit.
Well, well...
look who's here.
Have fun, junior.
Here we go.
Guess your dad's not
here to save you now.
I'm not afraid of you.
Yeah? You ever see a tire
take off a nose before?
Neither have i.
Might even kill you.
Wheel might chew
right in your brain.
You can visit your mom.
Jesus christ,
gus!
Go home.
I said go home!
I was just
fucking with him.
What are you going to do,
give me a ticket?
I mean, shit, gus,
come on.
You can't
lay a finger on me.
What are you doing,
man?
I'm just
fucking with you.
Stop it, man!
Ooh hoo!
Stop it!
Aah!
Whoops.
This is the police.
Come out
with your hands up.
Zowie, it's me.
Stay back.
Forget something,
drew, buddy?
Drew, buddy.
You have the right
to remain silent...
while i bash
your head in.
You have the right
to an attorney,
but you won't need one
'cause you'll be dead!
No, zowie, it's me!
No! Zowie!
Zowie!
Oh, god!
You understand these rights, drew, buddy,
or are you
just too fucking stupid?
Mom!
Gus killed
clyde, mom!
He's trying
to kill me!
What are you
talking about?
Aah!
Oh, shit!
Drew,
daddy's not done.
What are you
saying? What?
Aah!
Gus is dead!
What are you
talking about?
He's dead!
Just stop it!
I don't need--
* i wanna die
just like jesus christ *
* i wanna die... *
oh, no!
* I wanna die,
go see paradise *
* i wanna die
just like jesus christ *
mom, look!
God,
what does he want?
He wants to kill us!
Oh, god!
No!
What do you want?
Oh, gus, no!
Stop it!
* I wanna die
just like j.f.k. *
* i wanna die
in the u.s.a. *

* I wanna die *

aah!
I'm taking you up the hill, clyde, buddy.
That's the way
the indians did it.
Heh heh heh heh
heh heh.
And in local news,
tragedy has struck
the town of ludlow.
Friends and neighbors
paid respects
to drew
and amanda gilbert
who died in a head-on collision on saturday.
They are survived
by gus gilbert,
sheriff of
kennebago county.
Those poor people.
Did you see gus
at the funeral?
Yeah.
I feel so bad
for jeff.
How's he taking it?
I haven't talked to him.
He's been up in the attic
all afternoon.
The disappearance of a ludlow
youth remains a mystery.
Clyde parker was last seen
on saturday afternoon.
His motorcycle was
found off highway 62.
Hey... what are you doing?
Getting things ready
for mom.
Your mom is dead, jeff.
You know that.
She doesn't have to be.
What are you
talking about?
I can bring her back
the same way me and
drew brought zowie back.
What you're saying
is crazy, jeff.
Zowie didn't die.
He did.
We buried him.
There's this place
in the woods.
If you bury something there,
it comes back to you.
We did it on gus.
Don't you lie to me!
Fine!
Don't believe me!
Chase, you have a phone call.
It's the caretaker
at the cemetery.
I'll call back.
He says
it's an emergency--
something about
your wife's grave.
We're not finished.
What?
No, no, no.
I'll be right there.
What happened?
I-i don't know.
Can you stay here
with jeff
while i take care
of this?
Don't let him
leave this house.
Okay.
I'm sorry to disturb you,
dr. Matthews,
but i thought you might want to come over
and have a look
for yourself.
It's the damndest
thing!
Gus did this?
Yes. He stuck around
after the funeral,
told me that he had an
order to exhume your wife.
I didn't think
about it
until i saw him drag the
body out of the coffin.
He put your wife
in his pickup,
then he drove off right through
amanda and drew's headstones.
I swear,
this is the...
weirdest thing
that's happened
since louis creed
dug up his boy.
You bury your own.
Jeff?
Jeff?
Jeff?
Are you okay?
Aah!
Aah!
I hate that dog.
I'm sorry.

Well, i was building

What's going on
around here, gus?
Why did you
dig up my wife?
'Cause i wanted
to fuck her.
Ow.
Oh, i hate it
when that happens.
Yee-ahh!
No, no!
Got a permit
for this?
Aah!
I didn't think so.
No!
Ow!
Let me know
if this hurts.
No! Aah!
Aah, aah, aah!
No brain, no pain.
Think about it.
Remember, chase,
i had renee first.
Look.
Marjorie.
Jeff?
Did you really think you could be like me?
Aah!
Aah!
Mom.
I came back
for you, jeff.
We're going to be
together again.
We can try again,
chase.
Oh, my god.
We can make it
work this time.
No.
Don't you love me
anymore, chase?
You're not renee.
Renee's dead.
Get away
from her, jeff.
Get away.
Jeff, honey,
why don't you
go downstairs?
Your father and i
need to talk.
Jeff?
I love you.
I love you more.
Hey, junior.
Shit.
Want to play?
Jeff!
Uh-oh.
Looks like daddy
got a boo-boo!
Now, where were we?
No!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Here it comes, buddy.
Here it
fucking comes!
You're going to die,
junior.
You're going to die.
Eat this, asshole!
Come on, dad.
Get out.
I'm going to get you
out of here, dad.
Come here!
Oh...
i'm melting.
Jeff, honey,
what are you doing?
No!
You're not going to
leave me, jeff!
Your father and i are
trying to work things out!
Jeff!
I don't want
to be alone!
Jeff!
Come back. Jeff.
I love you.
She's not your mom.
Jeff, she's not your mom.
Let's go!
Stay with me!
Dead is better!
Dead is better!
Dead is better!
Stay with me!
Stay with me!
Aah!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
You all set?
Let's go.
I never
had anyone die before,
but i guess
you get over it.
I mean, eventually.
You never get over it.
