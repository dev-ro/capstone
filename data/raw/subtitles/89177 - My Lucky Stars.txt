Excuse me.
You take the stairs
- Let's go. There are cops.
- This way.
After them.
What are you doing? Stop!
Damn, a dead end.
Reverse back.
They're over there.
What now?
Hold tight.
Hold on.
Watch where you're going!
Let's split up.
Fujikyu-highland
Mind out!
Ouch! What are you playing at?
Ricky! They're over there.
Hey, you! Watch out!
Calm down. Those two won't
be able to find us.
Let's take another picture here.
Cheese.
No, you don't!
Mind out!
Welcome. Please do come in. Welcome.
Can you take our picture please?
Thank you.
One more picture.
I'll take one of you.
Say cheese.
Thank you.
- Do we have to go in?
- We've bought tickets now.
- You're pretty good.
- Here's the pictures.
As I said, there are advantages
to being on my turf.
If I want it,
that cop is as good as dead.
Ping! Answer the phone.
You get phone calls 24 hours a day.
I have to take the undercover
phone calls from all over the world.
Try the Bulgarian line.
Answer it yourself.
Ah, it's Ka-kui.
Hello, Superintendent. It's Muscles.
I've found him.
He's come out of hiding.
- Then bring him back.
- We can't. They've got Ricky.
I'll send over two more agents
to help you out.
No point. They already know who's in
the Hong Kong special branch.
- So now what?
- Get my friend Kidstuff to help me.
Who? Kidstuff!
Boss, if we don't get rid of it now,
it'll cause trouble.
- So what's it worth now?
- It's about 32\.
Sell it.
I thought I'd make a killing.
Dicky and Lam are fighting, Boss.
- Why are they fighting?
- It's over Bridget.
Show me Bridget.
Tell them they can have
this picture a week each.
Leave it alone.
- It's for the boss.
- Have it then.
It's Maggie Cheung, Boss.
- Is she clean?
- She's clean. Just a little dusty.
Put it in your pocket.
I'll have it later.
Get on with your work.
Sir.
Get those wasters from Block 3
over here.
7181 ! 5734! 6377!
Come over here!
- They're here, sir.
- Call 1663 over here.
You can go back to work.
1663! Over here!
You're being released today.
What, sir?
You're saying I can go free today?
Don't tease me. Even taking
into account holidays and weekends,
I'll still be here in the spring.
You're being released early for
good behaviour. You're free to go.
- Really?
- Sir doesn't joke.
I've got to get my belongs, sir.
You know - my watch and lighter.
No need. Here's $500.
It'll compensate for your loss.
Just go.
Can I say something to my friends?
- You have 30 seconds.
- Thank you, sir.
I'm going now. There's four packs
of Marlboro under the flower pot
and half a bottle of Coke
under the bed.
Share it amongst yourselves.
Remember to put away Cherry Chung,
Lee Choi-fung and Jenny.
Time's up, 1663!
I'm going, sir.
Goodbye, sir.
I want to fly up into the sky.
What have I done?
- Jail break.
- What?
You're just fitting me up.
Of course it's a fit-up
but if you cooperate with the police,
the charge will be dropped.
And there's a $2 million reward.
- Only if there's World War Ill.
- It's not that serious
We just want you to help us
bring back a fugitive.
Is it a cop?
It's unfortunate that
there was a bent cop on the force.
Using special branch as cover,
he stole a billion dollars worth
of gems.
He absconded to Japan and sought
protection from a known gangster.
The police can no longer pursue him,
so we're using a criminal genius
to bring him back.
I only became a crook
because I was rejected by the police.
I've always said that they should
change the selection criteria.
I need your answer.
Will you do it?
I'll do it.
But I need my friends to help me.
I don't care who helps you,
just as long as you are at
this address in 24 hours time.
And await my orders.
- I'll need an advance.
- I anticipated that.
Here.
First, write down the names
of your friends and give them to me.
Let's go. In your dreams!
Herb!
There are five decaying teeth -
three on top and two on the bottom.
- $3,000.
- What was that?
- $5,000
- Is that it?
- $7,000.
- It can't be. Give me another price.
$10,000 is all I have.
Fine. Give it to me.
Be careful or your white coat
will turn red.
Come in.
Mr Millionaire Chan is outside.
He says he is busy
and wants to be seen now.
Ask him to wait for two minutes.
Millionaire Chan is here.
What an opportunity.
- Hey, he's...
- If he's called Millionaire Chan,
he must have a million.
Or at least a hundred thousand.
- Don't be rash.
- Shut up and get over there.
- Please don't.
- Don't?
- Did you think 'don't' with him.
- No, don't.
- Calm down, Mr Chan.
- Don't.
Please come in, Mr Chan.
I...
- Are you Mr Millionaire Chan?
- Do you know me?
I'm a dentist and I am more familiar
with the teeth of my patients.
Do you know this person?
- She's an old girlfriend.
- So something did go on.
Do you mean a relationship?
- Of course.
- I also had a relationship with her.
- What relationship?
- Husband and wife.
What a coincidence.
Don't you think you deserve to die?
Look closely, I'm not that guy...
Tell me that he's not the adulterer.
Yes, it's him.
This is the moment that you will show
your true manhood.
Manhood I have
but I really don't know you.
I'm going to kill this adulterer.
- Please don't. Don't
- Out of the way.
Don't move. We're police.
- Who are you?
- I'm a crook.
We'll arrest the crook.
Got that, 36YE?
- Yes.
- Take him in.
So you're a crook?
Move it.
Don't go anywhere, the uniformed
officers will be here soon.
Buy my golden balls.
If you run, I won't be afraid.
Taking such a skinny dog
out for a walk?
Does this look like dog? It's a duck.
Shh! I'm talking to the duck.
It's none of your business.
Goodbye.
Teach Yourself Basic Telekinesis
With all my powers
focusing in on you,
I will you to lay an egg!
Lay an egg. Lay an egg.
He's crazy.
Why are we looking for him?
He's saner than you.
Look at this place.
You've got food, shelter
and it's rent free. No worries.
Hey, he's over there.
Hey, Sandy.
It's you lot. Have we got a job?
Why else would we be looking for you?
Fantastic. Fantastic.
We're going to be rich.
- Let's go.
- I'm going to be rich.
Here - take the dog.
But it's not female.
- Mah jong tonight?
- What?
- Mah jong tonight.
- What?
- Mah jong tonight!
- What?
- Mah jong tonight!
- OK.
- What time?
- What?
- What time?
- What?
- I asked what time!
- What?
- I asked what time?
- 3 o'clock.
- It's a date then?
- What?
- It's a date then.
- What?
- It's a date then!
- What?
- It's a date then!
- Right.
- Why aren't you working?
- What?
Why are you walking around
and not working?
- What?
- Why aren't you working?
You're too noisy.
I can't hear you.
- What are you doing?
- He shouldn't have told me off.
I'm just going to move this case
around.
Dinner time.
Didn't Roundhead used to work
with you? What's he doing here?
When his sister was single,
I helped him out,
but she's married now. Why bother?
- Where's Roundhead?
- Out to dinner.
Come on, deal!
We're back at work soon.
I won!
- Him again.
- It was flying over here.
He's over there.
- Hey.
- Shh!
- It's me!
- Damn!
It was coming over...
Big Bro, Bigger Bro,
Big Bigger Bro, Biggest Bro.
Forget about the Coke factory.
Come with us.
- OK. I'm off to get rich.
- Hey, the money!
- What was that card game?
- African rummy.
African rummy? How's it played.
We each hold 13 cards and
whoever's hand the fly lands on wins.
I don't know what you want us for,
Kidstuff,
but if Roundhead's in, I won't be.
I don't work with low IQs.
He's still part of our gang.
And he's loyal.
He's more toil than loyal.
Tell him to jump into the road.
Loyal?
Roundhead, I need you to do a job
but it could be dangerous.
Whatever you want me to do, brother.
Be a crook, whatever.
I'd sell my soul for you.
Jump into the road, then.
I jumped into the road, brother.
Teach Yourself Basic Telekinesis
Don't read when you're driving.
Turn left. Turn left. Turn left.
Turn left.
We're going to crash.
That was lucky.
Are you trying to kill us?
I'm sorry but I'm in the wrong van.
What the hell are you playing at,
Sandy?
First things first. Kidstuff,
you sort out the delivery driver.
- I'll handle the minibus driver.
- Hey, buddy.
What do we do now?
Don't worry. We stick together
and take on the enemy.
Be loud and aggressive, understand?
- Understand?
- Yes.
Let's go.
Today, there is no wind
and the sky is clear.
A person can walk unimpeded
and the traffic flows freely.
The cars come and go,
like the north and south winds.
Ahead is the road,
you can see in front and behind.
You reverse and I'll back up.
You bastard,
how dare you damage my van.
Think carefully
before you say anything.
Herb, last month an ape crashed into
your car. What happened to him?
He's become my hallway carpet.
He has patches of hair
here and there.
My friends think I've killed
a mountain gorilla.
Rawhide, what happened to that guy
who scratched your car?
No point bringing up past victories.
What about you, Kidstuff?
I'm more compassionate.
I put mine into
a bottle of formaldehyde
and gave him to Hong Kong University.
Tell him how you deal with
these situations, Roundhead.
Me? When my car is hit,
I get out and apologise.
Then I give him all my money
and I ask him to forgive me.
You idiot.
That situation was exactly like
this one. I can't act tough.
Is there a problem, Paul?
- Are they bullying you?
- Yes.
These are our own people!
As soon as I heard the accent,
I knew we were friends.
If I'd known earlier,
just a single sentence
would've settled this matter.
- We apologise.
- No need, they're our own kind.
No need to be too formal.
Let's move the vehicles and not block
the road for other road users.
Hey, brother.
Aren't folks from Chiu-chou
supposed to stick together?
Yes.
- Aren't Chui-chou folk loyal?
- Yes
- Don't they look after their own?
- Yes.
So why does a Chui-chou guy like me,
and in front of all my neighbours,
have to ask for a way out?
No need to ask.
But you're blocking my way.
So I'm asking can we go? ls that OK?
You can go but they can't.
Why not? They're Chui-chou folk, too?
They've just been in Hong Kong
a long time.
They don't look like us.
- Time changes people.
- That's right.
Recite a poem to him about the moon
in the Chui-chou dialect, Roundhead.
- Yes.
- Recite it to me.
Speak to him in Chui-chou.
Seven Eleven.
What?
That's all I know.
Hey, brother, what he said
wasn't in the Chui-chou dialect.
I told you to learn more Chui-chou
but you didn't. See what happens?
Enough! There's nothing special
about Chui-chou idiots.
Telekinesis!
You got us all beaten up.
So what if we had a crash?
The van was stolen.
It was you lot
that caused all the trouble.
It's Kidstuff's fault. He says he's
a good fighter but he cleared off.
What? How dare you criticise me?
It was your 'Seven Eleven'
that got us into this mess.
That's enough,
just blame it on the van.
Fine.
Fine? It was your fault.
Just Seven Eleven! And nothing else.
- Yes, Seven Eleven.
- You shit.
OK. That's it.
No more arguing.
Can you drive us to this place?
- What sort of place is it?
- Well, it's that place.
What sort of place is it?
I don't know.
When we get there, we'll find out.
What is this place, Kidstuff?
I don't know,
I was told to come here.
Herb, I think this house is older
than both you and me put together.
It's older than me
but possibly not you.
It doesn't matter if it's old,
as long as it's not dilapidated.
Not a problem.
A two-storey fall won't kill you.
But a fire would be serious.
We'll have to be careful.
I hope there isn't a ghost
because how will we know how it died?
- Have you finished?
- I've finished.
Let's go.
Good luck not bad. Good luck not bad.
Good luck not bad!
Wow! It's totally different
on the inside.
Home from home.
Not just home,
even the colour scheme suits me.
Yes, it feels like a brothel.
It suits you.
What?
- Can you help me?
- With what?
If I begin to stare at an object,
break my focus.
No problem.
Sit down.
Scrumptious.
We're all here, Kidstuff.
Talk to us
and don't keep us guessing.
I hate having to use my brain.
It's not that you hate using it,
you just don't have one.
Rawhide, in the orphanage,
did we ever fight?
They weren't fights,
you were just a punchbag.
A man fights only for two things.
The first is a woman
and the second is...self-respect.
If you so much as touch me...
I can if I want to.
- And so can l.
- And I'll do it back.
Don't fight you two.
Someone'll get hurt.
- What?
- What's it to you?
We can fight if we want to.
- Don't touch me.
- I want to.
If I wasn't so patient,
you'd be floored. Don't touch me.
I like touching you.
- Don't touch me.
- I want to.
- I'm warning you.
- What are you going to do?
If you keep trying to touch me...
Disperse the anger.
Disperse the anger.
Disperse the anger.
Disperse the anger.
- Why did you kick me?
- You said I had to break your focus.
I was helping them.
I'll make your stomach blow up.
He's...
Thank God it's not me. He can give
you stomach ache just by looking.
Me, first.
- What is it?
- It's you.
I ate some of those grapes and
I've been on the toilet ever since.
How many toilets are there
in this house?
There are five
but I'm using this one.
Which is closer, Superintendent?
Left or right?
To your right.
Better not.
Is everyone better now?
Who are you?
I'm...
He was the sergeant
who first arrested me.
That was then.
Now I'm a superintendent
with the special branch.
My name is Walter Tsao.
Are you shopping us
to the cops, Kidstuff?
It's really not my fault.
- You grassed us up!
- How could you?
- Get up.
- No.
It's not his fault.
I forced him to.
So it's nothing to do with us.
Let's go.
No need to hurry. Switch on
the television and find out the news.
- What news?
- I don't know.
...we'll stir-fry some more
and soon the dish
will be ready to serve.
There now follows a special bulletin.
At noon today,
six masked men entered the Dong Po
bank in Tsim Shai Tsui with guns
and escaped with
$200,000,000.
Yee-hai is our reporter
at the scene.
Do the police have any leads?
Although the men were masked,
we have several leads
and the police know who they are.
They are Rawhide,
Sandy, Kidstuff,
- Roundhead, Herb and Poison lvy.
- Thank you.
That's the end of the Bulletin.
It's got nothing to do with me.
You've got to believe me.
Don't be so hasty.
I arranged all of this.
You are all fugitives now
and you can't escape.
But right now, I am the only one
who knows that you are here.
No-one knows?
Apart from me, nobody else knows
what has happened here
and I came here in secret.
- Really?
- I, Walter Tsao, swear it.
Brothers, I have a suggestion.
Since no-one knows Superintendent
Tsao is here,
Iet's play a game with him.
- Is it Five Fugitives Beat Up Cop?
- Yes.
Help!
- Freeze.
- Don't move.
Luckily, the government
consider me irreplaceable,
or you'd have beaten me to death.
If you don't have a go at me, they
won't have a go at you. All right?
No more.
OK. Then there's no problem here.
Stand down.
Yes, sir. Stand down.
You're intelligent people,
you do realise your predicament?
I won't leave you on your own.
I have a top assistant
who will accompany you.
No need. The five of us
can handle it.
That's right.
We don't want the police involved
or there'll be misunderstandings.
We're always against the police.
Now you want us to co-operate?
No way!
I second that.
Hi, beautiful.
- Who are you looking for?
- I'm Mr Tsao's assistant.
I'm called Herb.
Let me help you with your luggage.
- Please come in.
- Thank you.
- Mr Tsao, Sir.
- There's no point in coming.
With an assistant such as yourself
to help us,
the mission is already
half completed. Welcome.
- Welcome.
- Welcome.
Please take a seat.
Please sit.
- Please take a seat.
- Excuse me.
I'll be off now. Miss Woo will fill
you in on the details of the mission.
- Fine.
- Miss Woo...
You four,
see Superintendent Tsao out.
No need. Who wants to move?
Come over here, Miss Woo.
Please.
- Make sure you follow the plan.
- I will.
- I wish you success.
- Fine. Have an early night.
Let me introduce myself.
I'm Miss Woo.
I'm an inspector in
the elite Hong Kong special branch.
You can call me lnspector Woo.
But for the sake of the mission,
you should call me Poison lvy.
- So she's Poison lvy.
- Who would have guessed?
Miss Poison lvy!
Who is it?
- What do you want?
- Shh! Can't you hear it?
No.
I saw a dark figure
enter your room.
- Is he under here?
- What are you doing? That's so lame.
Get out.
Fine. Look after yourself.
- Don't move. This is a robbery.
- A real robbery?
Shut up or we'll stab you.
What now, brother?
Don't move.
You over there.
Get up. Get up!
Get up. Get up.
- Don't resist or they'll kill us.
- Give me the rope.
Don't tense up or it'll hurt.
Let's see what's in here.
Don't be scared, lvy.
It'll be over soon.
What's in here?
When it's safe, I'll shout for help.
- It's done.
- Hurry up, Sandy. You go in now.
Hurry up and go in.
- What happened?
- There's been a robbery.
What? You've been robbed.
Don't worry let me undo the rope.
Sandy, you stay here and protect
Poison lvy. I'll call the police.
I'm here, Poison lvy.
Don't be afraid,
- Don't move, this is a robbery.
- A robbery.
You'd dare to commit a robbery
with me here? What do you want?
- Move it.
- What do we do, brother?
Tie them up.
Don't move.
Tie them up tighter.
Look in here.
Nothing in here - Iet's look outside.
Since we're like this,
how about a dance?
Dance on your head!
- What happened?
- Nothing. Nothing.
- We've been robbed.
- Robbed!
You take care of her.
I'm off to call the police.
- It wasn't enough.
- Hey, where are you going?
Get in there.
- Get changed.
- Hurry up and go in.
- Don't move. This is a robbery.
- Another robbery?
- What do you want?
- Just money, not your life. Move.
Don't try and resist us, fatso.
Get over there.
Move it.
You're so heavy, I can't breathe.
Don't get any ideas, fatty.
- I won't.
- Let's go.
Don't be scared.
- Thank you. Off you go.
- Someone will come.
What's going on?
- A robbery.
- A robbery?
You take care of her.
I'll call the police.
Yes. Fine.
- It's their turn now
- Hurry up.
- Are you OK?
- Don't move.
I'm going to faint!
- What do we do, brother?
- Tie them up.
Move it.
Now it's my turn now.
Finally, it's my turn.
What happened, Roundhead?
Don't worry about me. Off you go.
It looks like you've been robbed.
Let me undo the rope.
It must have hurt but it's over now.
- Thank you.
- It's all over now.
Let's call the police.
You call the Police.
I've got to protect lvy. Go.
Hurry up.
If you're being robbed,
you should scream out.
If you'd screamed,
I'd have come in and protected you.
Didn't you know
that I really care about you?
- This is a robbery.
- Yes! This is a robbery.
- What? Another robbery?
- Yes, another robbery?
Do we tie them up, brother?
Yes, but this guy looks
quite violent.
So I brought an extra rope to tie
them up separately.
- Tie them up separately?
- Is that a good idea?
Yes!
No! What are you doing?
He was all bundled up with her
but I have to be tied up separately?
I'm not playing any more.
I knew you'd betray me, Roundhead.
I'm not Roundhead.
You think we can't recognise you now?
It's nothing to do with me.
Nothing happened between us. Right?
Sorry, we were only playing.
- Nothing more.
- Nothing more!
- Get out, all of you.
- Get out.
You're totally out of order.
Fooling around like this.
It's late. Let's get some sleep.
Get out.
Welcome back!
It's late. Let's get some sleep.
We're sorry.
We're really sorry.
We apologise.
We were just playing.
We're going now.
Smile everyone.
Ready, smile.
Done.
Look at this gear.
Will they give us a plane to fly?
No flying, just whacking.
- Whacking? How come?
- Ask Poison lvy.
We can go, everyone.
Now you know how to whack off.
- Like this.
- Whack me, would you?
You're always fooling around.
I'll get you, Roundhead.
Forget it.
You wait here
while I get you checked in.
I'm off to find a toilet.
I need a drink of water.
Well, I'm off talent spotting.
Stand there and don't move.
Sir, I'm sorry but this paper
is for the Telex machine,
not for drying your hands.
Thank you for your understanding.
(Speaks made-up Japanese)
Wait here, Fong.
I've got to get something.
Watch where you're going.
You're the one not looking.
- I was too busy looking elsewhere.
- What are you looking at?
That Nip girl is quite stunning.
How do you know she's a Nip?
You know the difference between
a cabbage and a turnip?
What are you doing, Roundhead?
- I lost 100 yen outside.
- So why are you looking for it here?
It's dark outside but in here
it's light, so I'll look in here.
Just keep searching until daybreak.
How are you going to find it in here?
I found it. 100 yen.
Hey, that's my 100 yen.
- We can go up.
- Get the suitcases.
It's really nice!
Who do you think lives over there?
- Well, it's not you.
- That's obvious.
The hotel is full,
so we're all sharing.
Fantastic.
So we can all bunk together?
If you want to bunk together,
I won't object -
you'll be in the lounge
and I'll be in the bedroom.
Let me help you carry that.
- This room has two beds, lvy.
- So?
- We can't waste a bed.
- That's right.
OK, one of you have the bed.
Don't embarrass her.
Get out. Get out. Get out!
I'm sorry, lvy. But the boys
need to talk something through.
Get out.
We've all grown up together
and I'm nearing middle age.
There's not much of my youth left.
You can pity me or give me a break
but let me have the bed.
Roundhead, set a good example
and speak first.
- No
- What?
He said no.
Tell me again, Roundhead.
No. No. No.
I always let you win
but I have to get a wife,
so I can't now.
- OK. We'll settle this the old way.
- Fine.
When I was walking past your house
With a pail of water you did me douse
The water splashed onto my shoes
The passers-by were all amused
Not a thing to me did you say
Just stared at me in this way...
Which bit is funny?
I was pretending,
I don't know Japanese.
Keep pretending then.
- You're inhuman.
- How can you even think it?
And I thought I knew you.
You lowlife!
I'm sorry I kicked you.
It was a mistake. Please forgive me.
I forgive you. But I don't know why
it still hurts so much.
- Close your eyes.
- But I won't be able to see you.
When I've rubbed this in,
then you can see me.
Don't say a word.
- Acting up!
- That'll teach you.
You're sleeping on the floor.
The bed's got two layers.
Give me one.
Move it yourself.
Do you know him?
Ka-kui.
Right. He's here in Japan
using the name Muscles.
- Kidstuff...
- Enough said, I'm not doing it.
Ka-kui is only out for himself. Being
with him will be the death of you.
You can't let personal feelings
get in the way of the mission.
I don't want to shirk
my responsibility
but it's hard to work with him.
As children, we stole sweet potatoes
but when we got caught,
he fingered me with the blame.
Then when we grew up, we were playing
rummy and I gave him the good cards.
He won, and he didn't split
the winnings.
I had plans to open a gambling den.
After I told him my plans,
he said he was a cop
and he'd bust the joint.
Now you want me to help him.
Look at me, Kidstuff.
The eyes are the window
to the soul.
If that's true,
you'll be able see my dedication.
- I don't understand.
- Come closer.
And now?
I can only see me.
And he's the only thing in my heart.
You're the hero in my eye
but I've yet to see a heroic act.
- There will be soon.
- We shall see.
I would like to see how a real man
shows his true courage.
And forsake the kid's stuff.
- I'm with you.
- I haven't finished praising you.
You have to face the task ahead.
So let's co-operate
and rise to this challenge.
Let's go, then.
I was a little too eager there.
Follow me.
In here.
Muscles?
Muscles?
Don't move, fatty.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm meeting a girl.
Where is Muscles?
Tell me.
I'm looking for him, too.
- Don't let anyone escape.
- With just the two of us?
And me.
Wherever you go, there's trouble.
- It's him.
- Kill them.
A present for you.
- How are you? It's been a long time.
- I was fine up until now.
- Thank you for your help.
- If I'd known it was you...
Let's forgot our childhood for now.
We're here on a mission.
Let's tie them up.
Here's 200 million yen.
Go and spend it.
You think I'm going to die.
I don't want it.
It's bait.
- Here you are, sir.
- Good evening, sir.
Thank you.
- Have you found him?
- No, I've searched everywhere.
Kidstuff has always been selfish.
Let's order.
How may I help you, sir?
Milk. Ham and eggs.
How may I help you, sir?
- He doesn't understand you.
- Yeah.
- Milk.
- Yes.
Ham. Cooked ham.
- Fried eggs.
- I understand.
And you, sir?
Me? Coffee.
- Coffee.
- Coffee.
Spaghetti with a meat sauce.
Meat.
Meat sauce. Spaghetti.
Spaghetti with a meat sauce.
- And you, sir?
- Club sandwich.
In English, club sandwich.
Bread, butter...
Chicken, ham...
Bread, butter...
Egg.
Lettuce and tomato - I can't do.
More bread.
With so many layers,
it has to be a club sandwich.
- Do you understand?
- Certainly, sir.
I want...
If you can't explain it,
you don't eat, Roundhead.
And you can't have what we have.
- Grapefruit Juice.
- Grapefruit juice?
Grapefruit...juice.
OK? And sausages.
Sausages?
How are you going to do that?
You know "sausages" in Japanese?
I didn't say a thing,
I showed him.
Very good.
A club sandwich.
The gambling den here
belongs to a Japanese gangster.
You'll have to pretend to be bigshots
to get their attention.
I won't be there to help you out.
Just stay alert.
- Let's play, gentlemen.
- Come in.
Please play whatever you like.
This is boring,
if it's not odd, it's even.
- I'm here to help.
- OK, fine.
- Here, this is yours.
- Thank you.
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.
Could these gentlemen
have these seats?
Please sit. Good luck.
Rawhide, Herb, Kidstuff, Sandy and
Roundhead, do you know how to play?
- Don't use our names, Poison lvy.
- That's right.
- Place your bets!
- Place your bets!
Hey, there's a hole.
- What is it?
- 2 and 3. Odd.
If it was that easy to see,
they'd go broke.
Even
- It's just a little bet.
- Let's see.
Two and three. Odd.
I told you.
- Place your bets.
- Place your bets.
Lay a bet. Do you want to take
the money back to Hong Kong?
What is it this time?
- If you trust me, it's odd.
- I trust you.
Let's play. Three and six. Odd.
Odd.
Bet.
Excuse me.
Don't go, beautiful.
If we win, we'll give it back.
It's only the bank's money.
If you take this money back
to Hong Kong, they'll arrest you.
- Over to you.
- I understand.
Pleased to meet you.
Hello, Big Brother. Outside there
are six people from Hong Kong.
Judging by their names and faces,
they could be the bank robbers
the police are looking for.
What should I do?
It's the cops! Get out! Get out!
This way,
our friends from Hong Kong.
Hurry up.
Thank you very much indeed.
A drink, everyone.
I really admire what you did
in Hong Kong.
Your bravery paid off.
Our organisation needs
new people like you.
I extend my welcome to you.
- One more dance.
- No, thanks.
These Japanese folk songs are
the same as the ones in Hong Kong.
I thought they would drink,
eat and bathe with you.
Don't be stupid.
This isn't Hong Kong.
It doesn't matter,
we are here as guests.
I know what you mean.
I've already arranged
some pretty girls for you.
Not bad.
We welcome you, gentlemen.
These five will be fine
just eating and drinking.
They have all their hearts desire
and I don't think they'd want
their girlfriends to find out
they'd been enjoying
outside pleasures, right?
I won't force you.
Hold on.
It would be impolite to turn down
this gift. It's just entertainment.
If our girlfriends found out,
they'd forgive us.
That's right. When you're out
in the big wide world,
you may hold one girl
but you're thinking of another.
They're here to provide a service,
so we won't disappoint them.
I've just had my heart broken
and I need comforting.
Speak. Do whatever you want.
It's been offered,
so we can't turn it down.
Please keep enjoying yourselves.
I'm being called for.
Yes, yes.
Come over here.
- So?
- I don't know the five men,
but when I was in the police,
I saw Fatty with Muscles.
I'll take care of it.
- Let's change seats, Roundhead.
- Why?
I don't have to explain myself
to you. Just do it.
Get up.
One of you will have to leave
this happy group for a while.
I do hope you will join
our organisation.
So that we complete the formalities,
who's going to get the money?
This task is a great responsibility.
I'm not worthy.
I've always been a man of leisure,
so I can't.
I'm mentally ill and an attack
can come on at any time.
Surely such an important duty
can't be given to me.
OK, I'll go.
Well, it was me who hid the money.
- Ma-chui, take this gentleman back.
- I understand.
Look after yourself, Poison lvy.
I've always looked after myself.
Just go, Kidstuff.
Don't be dramatic.
- Hurry up, before it all goes bad.
- It'll be OK.
I'm just telling him
to get a move on.
Enjoy yourselves.
Kidstuff...
Do it yourself.
Muscles...
Triple one, six, one, seven.
- Hello?
- Hello?
Hello, Kidstuff.
- Who's that?
- Muscles. How's it going?
They're over there and I'm back here
to get 200 million for their ransom.
- You don't have it.
- So what do I do now?
- I'll give it to you.
- Hurry up, I'll wait.
Stop mucking about.
How was I supposed to know
it was you coming in?
- So 200 million looks like this.
- It's 100 million, not 200.
You said 200 million,
so why is there 100?
They only want half,
so why give it all to them?
- Where do you make the drop?
- At the fairground tomorrow.
I knew it was the fairground
but I don't know where exactly.
Here's a lighter. When you light it,
I'll get a signal.
Remember, as soon as you are
in their hide-out, notify me.
Try it out.
Hey, Kidstuff.
Don't light it here.
Only when it's time.
Don't keep staring.
It's me - Muscles.
Roll up, roll up
for the House of Horrors.
Keep the queue moving!
You don't want to miss this.
Roll up, roll up.
Closed for repair.
Please enjoy our other attractions.
You don't scare me.
So many lanterns here!
Big ones and round ones.
That startled me.
That's not a real one.
Come on if you dare!
It's real!
Stop wasting my time.
Kill
Where are my friends?
We checked out the Hong Kong robbery
and the money you brought over.
- And so?
- Both are fake.
We've got stuff like this, too.
- Tai-lok.
- Yes.
Go to Mount Fuji and take this
lighter. Smoke as much as you can.
Take some matches,
it's almost out of fuel.
Really?
You idiot. As soon as you lit it,
you told the police where we are.
Get out.
If you get caught by the police,
don't ever come back.
I understand.
Take him inside and lock him up.
Pack up the stuff.
- You finally got here!
- We're having so much fun.
Catch, lvy.
Where's the other policeman?
Answer her.
He's pretending.
Well done, Muscles.
Sleep! Sleep! Sleep!
Don't hit me. Don't hit me.
Don't hit me.
I said, don't hit me.
- Protect me, brother.
- Keep calm.
They can't hurt you if I'm here.
What's with you?
Good boy, get up.
Come on, get up.
- Are you OK?
- No problems. How about you?
I'm fine.
- You tempted us with women.
- And conned us.
Let's hit him.
- Hit him.
- Hit him!
Get him.
- That was a brave move.
- You missed by how much?
- Just a bit.
- After him.
- Ricky!
- Open the door first.
I'll take care of her.
She's too powerful.
You're on a salary. Why so dedicated?
Dedicated to vengeance.
I give up.
- Where are they?
- They're over there.
- There's lots of police upstairs.
- Let's go.
So what? We're police, too.
Oh, yeah.
Get in the car, you lot!
Get in, get in.
Thank you for your help, Kidstuff.
No need. I just don't want
to see you again.
- Get a car for them.
- We won't ride in a police vehicle.
- You're older now, grow up.
- Of course.
When I was walking past your house,
With a pail of water you did me douse
The water splashed onto my shoes
The passers-by were all amused
Not a thing to me did you say
Just stared at me in this way...
With thanks to -
# I watch the crowd
that flows like cloud
# It's a small place
but things change every day
# Lazy or hard-working,
you're all human beings
# You all have kind hearts
# The lucky star is shining upon you
# Keeping you safe from danger
# Free your heart from its burdens
# Rid the hatred
and may you have no enemies
# Be relaxed and cheerful,
let everything please you
# Laughter's heard in every family,
dreams come true
# Everyone finds their true love
and the love lasts forever
# The lucky star shines
and brings you wealth
# You don't mix with people
and don't help others
# You are so childish
# Whether you are rich or poor,
you are a human being
# Don't be so uptight
# The lucky star shines
and changes your luck
# May it keep you safe from danger
# Free your heart from its burdens
# Rid the hatred
and may you have no enemies... #
