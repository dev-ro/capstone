Over 100 years ago,
Titans suddenly appeared
and devoured most of humanity,
decimating civilisation.
The survivors built
three massive concentric walls
to prevent another Titan invasion,
and managed a peaceful life inside.
But even though the walls
have stood for 100 years,
there are no guarantees
they won't fall today.
He was fired again!
What a hopeless kid.
Eren? Again?
What to do with him...
What to do, indeed.
Sorry, Dad,
I need to step out.
Going to see Eren?
Tell him!
I'm all out of job leads.
I'm going now.
Make it clear.
The usual hill, I bet.
- Be careful.
- Hey there.
- Welcome!
- Can I get some rapeseed oil?
It's a good crop this year.
- A full tank.
- Sure thing.
Outta the way!
Armin!
This thing you made me, it broke.
See?
I'll fix it later.
Don't take too long!
Oh, sorry.
Is Mikasa around?
Mikasa?
Mikasa!
Yes?
Eren!
I knew you'd be here.
This thing keeps people away.
It's dangerous.
Chill out.
It's a dud bomb.
Eren!
Ow...
What if it explodes?
So be it.
I wouldn't mind
if it blew us all up.
Heard you got fired again.
Only a month into the job.
Longer than the security gig.
Why can't you ever stick with something?
What is it you want to do?
Are you happy
just taking over for your dad?
Look, this runs on batteries.
"Batteries"?
I want to make more things like these.
Just be careful so you don't get arrested.
And you, Mikasa?
- Me?
- Yeah.
I only...
Are you content?
The Inner District is full of
big buildings and rich people.
And lots of stuff you can't find out here.
Don't you want to go?
Then what about outside the Wall?
Born inside the Wall,
and dying inside it...
You're fine with that?
I'm...
Not.
I'm just like...
This thing.
Wait...
Hey, let me see.
Look.
A woman?
The ocean.
"Ocean"?
The big water you mentioned?
This blue thing must be the ocean.
Ocean?
So it was real.
- Not a pond?
- A billion times bigger.
That really exists out there?
Just like I said.
I wonder if that bird
has seen the ocean.
Wanna see it?
Protecting the Wall instead of people.
Screw that job.
Let's go.
Wait a second.
We can't get near it.
This way.
Hurry, over here.
It'll be fine.
Careful.
Right?
Never seen the Wall this close.
Let's go.
I don't need to go now.
Then when?
If you climb the Wall, you'll be executed.
And they say the outside is full of Titans.
Due to a huge bomb,
only Titans can survive outside.
You seriously believe in Titans?
No one's seen them in over 100 years.
Yet we're holed up in here, afraid of them.
I'm sick of it.
Maybe the other side
is paradise.
Hey, what're you doing?
You renegades!
Come!
This is off limits!
Don't touch her!
Stop resisting!
That was uncalled for!
Armin, don't!
That's enough.
You'll be executed!
Hey, hey...
You haven't changed.
Old man Souda...
Leave this to me.
You guys can go. Hey!
They're just kids.
Here.
Go.
Go on.
So, trying to show off in front of her?
It's not like that.
I get it, I get it.
I was caught doing the same thing as a kid.
I asked your mom to come along.
Your dad ended up winning her, though.
This isn't about that.
It just pisses me off.
"Even paradise could become a prison
"if you take notice of the walls."
Now, don't tell the others about this.
We're starting a scout.
A scout?
You're going outside?
Lies, it'll fall through again.
It won't. Looks like the
council will finally pass it.
The public discontent is rising.
You're really
going outside the Wall?
We're forming a Scout Regiment.
Eren,
how about it?
Once we find new land,
we're free to live anywhere.
Mikasa.
- An earthquake?
- Too big for an earthquake.
The Wall's shaking.
It's from outside.
Eren, no!
So they're real.
It's taller than the Wall.
This can't be...
I thought we were safe!
There's something there.
What is that?
Remember our drills!
Run! The Wall will be breached!
The town!
Hey! Run this way!
Aim the cannons at the Titan!
Aim the cannons at the Titan!
- Prepare the cannons!
- Hurry!
Prepare the cannons!
We don't have permission
to use gunpowder yet...
Hurry, they're coming!
Hurry!
Don't panic! Remember the drills!
Look at those faces...
Prepare the cannons!
- Draw them in!
- Yes, sir!
Prepare the cannons!
Cattle.
Cattle, cattle.
- Ready to fire!
- Fire!
It's a hit!
Did we get it?
The legend was true.
They're immortal.
Reload!
Reload!
Come on!
Hurry!
What're you doing?
It's hopeless.
Kill the Titan!
Help me! I'm sorry...
I'm sorry!
Squad Leader! Squad Leader!
Let's run!
Armin!
That thing won't...
I'm gonna check on my home!
Armin, run...
That's Armin's dad.
Let's go!
Don't cry!
Let us in!
Don't push!
Wait!
Wait!
That woman...
I'll go.
Get up! Get up!
I'll get the baby.
Mikasa!
That's it, close it!
Now! Close that door!
Mikasa!
Why?
There's still room!
Don't you dare open it!
The Titans are coming!
Only trying to save yourselves...
Mikasa!
Mikasa.
Hold him down!
Let me go!
Mikasa!
Mikasa...
Help!
Two Years Later
The price for our years of peace
was paid for with tragedy.
The Outer Wall in the Monzen District
was destroyed by a Titan
larger than ever imagined.
Unable to counter the surge of Titans,
we abandoned the agricultural zone
and retreated behind the Middle Wall
to the commercial zone.
With hordes of refugees
and the loss of farmlands,
our food shortage is becoming dire.
In order to reclaim our farmlands,
we must restore the broken Outer Wall.
This, we vowed!
It is to carry out this prestigious mission
that you have all completed your training.
- Weapons Squad Leader Hans.
- Sir!
The days of our being trampled
by Titans are over.
Now we have omni-directional mobility gear!
With ODMG,
victory will be ours!
At the Omotemachi transit point,
we will join the recon team
led by Captain Shikishima.
Captain Shikishima!
We will depart for Monzen at sunset.
May you fight to honour
the spirits of the war dead.
Give your hearts!
Give your hearts!
I'll be back, so take care of Mom.
The family's in your hands.
Now that's a good daughter.
You were always a glutton,
never making yourself useful...
Sasha, pick 'em up! Pick 'em up, I said!
- I'm sorry.
- Just do it, Sasha.
I can't get it.
Jean, my son, you must take revenge for me.
Jean, become the pride of our clan.
Offer your soul
to the spirits of the war dead...
Jean! Jean!
My son!
Mommy's only going to be
gone for a little bit, OK?
Just be a good girl and...
Riko!
Riko!
Hey, don't cry, little brother...
Hey, hey...
Koyuki, who's this?
Is this supposed to be me?
It's a little fat to be me, no?
Hey, don't cry, I'll be fine.
Cry baby.
No one's gonna be waiting for us.
Mister.
Here, you can have this.
Thanks.
Koyuki, your brother's leaving now.
Brother...
Koyuki, let's go.
Here.
Thank you.
That's mine.
Mr Souda.
Armin.
Old man Souda?
Eren?
So you're alive!
So now...
You boys, too.
Well, everyone died.
What happened to the girl?
- It was my fault.
- That's not true.
That's why
I'm going to kill it.
Revenge on the Titans, eh?
Killing one or two
won't make a difference, you know.
Why did you volunteer, then?
To see my wife and child.
They're waiting.
Excuse me!
Who're you?
I'm sorry.
Are you finished?
Are you even listening?
Look, right now,
the Outer Wall in Monzen
has a hole in it like this.
So we detonate this portion
to plug that hole.
The Wall here becomes shorter,
but it's twice as tall as the Titans.
So we can stop any more
Titans from entering.
That's the Outer Wall Restoration Mission.
Once we plug that hole,
we exterminate the Titans inside!
Sasha.
But previous restoration
missions failed miserably.
They were attacked by Titans
before reaching the Wall,
and ran out of explosives.
We no longer have materials
to make the bombs.
All that's left are
the last explosives in Omotemachi.
If we fail,
it'll be the end of humanity.
We have no choice.
You don't have to.
Pipsqueaks like you just get in the way.
Not just you, look around.
Just a bunch of useless bums.
It's been a long war of attrition.
Inevitably there will be
more inexperienced folks.
Sure.
But even the Scout Regiment
was wiped out in this mission.
Instead, we've got
a potato girl whose mind
is only on eating...
Seconds, please.
How could you eat right now?
Sorry, lady.
Not enough farmlands.
But I was told workers
won't ever go hungry.
How na√Øve are you?
Your parents sold you to save costs.
You all came here because
you couldn't find work.
Now I'm being lumped with
you scum who're just here to die.
Stop with this talk of dying.
I can't... I just can't do this!
Lil, Lil, Lil...
Don't worry, I'll protect you.
Damn love birds, get a room.
He seems annoyed.
He's afraid of Titans.
You nailed it.
Titans are like nothing to me.
Do Titans have nipples?
Do they have nipples?
You talk big for having never seen one.
Just a spoiled brat from inland.
- Say that again.
- They don't!
I told you, Titans have
no reproductive organs.
So they have no nipples, either.
How they propagate is a mystery.
I want to dissect one,
but they evaporate when they die.
So I need a live Titan!
I want to do this!
Gather in 10 minutes for gear check.
Yes, sir!
Oh, that reminds me...
There was a guy who abandoned
his girl when he saw a Titan.
Bet he's missing his nuts, too.
Hey, stop it! Knock it off!
Why do you two always go at it?
Sannagi, let me down!
Let go of me!
We gather in 10.
Hey, pick up the pace!
This way!
Hurry up!
Don't lag!
It'll be OK.
You're going home.
You're from Monzen, right?
Everyone died.
I want to go home, too.
Sannagi, were you from a Yuen farm?
Yeah, I want to go home and farm again.
For my brothers and sisters.
I'd do anything for them.
The old road to Omotemachi.
Titans sleep at night,
and their eyes won't work anyway.
So we'll go straight to Omotemachi by dawn.
But do not raise your voices.
Titans are very responsive to human voices.
And the other Titans will notice.
Bite your tongue before you scream!
If you don't want to die,
get to Omotemachi by dawn.
- Open the gate!
- Open the gate!
Ready to move out, sir!
Move out.
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."
Past this hell, the Goddess
awaits at Omotemachi.
The Goddess?
You don't know?
The Titan-slaying female
squad leader under Shikishima.
They say she killed over
10 Titans in half a year.
Sounds more like a Grim Reaper
than a goddess.
- I'm afraid.
- Don't worry.
There's something there.
Stop the vehicles.
- Already there?
- Awfully early.
What's going on? This isn't Omotemachi.
Check the premises. Move out.
Oh, come on.
What is it?
Just cattle.
Do Titans only eat humans?
Forward. Each squad to the front.
Potato Girl, you'll wake up
the Titans with that noise.
Here.
Not enough?
You always feed me.
Wait.
Still no Titans coming out.
We should get there by dawn.
Hey, don't say it aloud. You'll jinx us.
All clear, let's go.
I hear a child...
A child left behind.
Don't be stupid.
We have to help.
Hey.
We have to help.
Hiana.
I can hear it.
Shit.
We're close.
Get up!
Those idiots.
Where? Where are they?
Hey, keep it down.
You'll wake up the Titans.
Keep calm. Keep calm!
Keep calm!
No matter what happens...
Captain!
They brought them.
Director General!
Go! Go!
Forward!
Hey, wait!
We're not on yet!
You guys, wait!
There are tall buildings up ahead!
Run and meet us there!
We're not fighting?
- What about the ODMG?
- Where do we fire them?
We can't beat them head-on.
Go!
Armin!
Sannagi!
Don't raise your voices...
We're almost there! Run!
- We're there!
- That's Omotemachi!
Kill them!
Titans are not invincible.
Even if you destroy their limbs
or head, they'll quickly regenerate.
But this spot right here!
If the nape is severely damaged,
it will perish without regenerating.
However, it's difficult to
attack this area with firearms.
Currently, what's most effective is this.
The omni-directional mobility gear!
With this on our hips, we can move
quickly and freely in the air.
Fire the anchor and reel it in
to lift yourself up.
Maintain the height as
you aim for the nape.
Of course, remember to evade
the Titan's attacks.
Then use the blades to carve
the flesh from the nape.
Without its nape, the Titan will die.
Once a Titan dies, its body will evaporate.
At present, this is the only
known method of killing a Titan.
The Scout Regiment!
That's Captain Shikishima.
Wouldn't mind a hot Titan chick for once.
They're still here!
We're finished!
I'm tying it. Hang in there.
Director General Kubal is here.
You guarded the explosives well.
I attempted to inspect the contents,
but this was impossible to open.
Director General,
what about the explosives?
There are rumours of an insurgency,
you see.
I see.
Certainly safe down there.
Sorry, it was top secret.
Finish loading by dawn!
They're our last explosives,
treat them with care.
You messed this whole thing up!
If you wanna die, do it alone!
You've got a death wish.
You smell, you spoiled brat.
You peed in your pants, huh?
The Titans scared you?
Hey!
Stop it.
Stop it!
You're too slow.
You're the one who's slow.
Thanks.
What the hell...
Enough with the disturbance.
Mikasa.
Mikasa, it's you, right? What happened?
Nice kick...
It's Captain Shikishima!
...for just messing around.
Rookie, your name?
Eren. I'm Eren!
Eren?
From Monzen?
Your parents?
They died. I was too young to remember.
I see.
About Mikasa...
Why is she...
Why?
Why what?
Why is she able to toy with Titans?
I taught her.
You want to learn, too, huh?
Well, of course...
I want to defeat the Titans.
Why?
Because I hate them...
Those Titans.
Why do you hate them?
Because
they're the ones who trapped us in.
Wrong.
The true enemy
isn't the Titans.
The true enemy?
The true enemy
is safety.
What do you call animals that live
inside fences in fear of wolves?
Cattle.
And what are you?
I'm...
Not!
Then go fly.
Fly?
You can only gain by letting go.
The kid I gave this to... He died.
I hear there used to be lots of machines.
People back then even flew the skies.
But now it's forbidden.
- Director General!
- At ease.
Tell me, did you learn in school
what that technological advancement
led to?
Environmental destruction,
wasted resources,
useless competition and war.
Precisely.
Now get yourself some good rest.
Yes, sir!
At daybreak, we head for Monzen.
Inspect your gear and rest up.
Fighting is the one thing
he was always good at.
You reek of booze.
Why do you hate that guy so much?
His face...
As if he's carrying
the world's misery by himself.
He lost his girlfriend, right?
Her name was Mikasa.
Mikasa.
I'm just...
Glad.
Glad?
That baby was eaten.
And so was I.
The world is cruel.
I'm just going to kill Titans.
Sorry.
Did I interrupt?
No.
Want it? It's good.
Calling the Titans again?
Sorry.
It should be me apologising.
Forget it.
What happened between
you and Squad Leader Mikasa?
Still act like a kid, huh?
It doesn't matter any more.
- There's someone here.
- It's fine, they're not looking.
Hey, wait.
Your back feel OK?
Lil, I love you.
Wonder if those two will get to marry.
If they make it home alive.
It's not right that we need
permission to get married.
And even if you have a baby...
Riko...
You have a daughter, was it?
By volunteering for duty,
I get child support.
You OK with a single mother?
Will you be father to my daughter?
I don't want to die! No, let me go!
Riko!
We're surrounded! We're under attack!
We're under attack!
We're under attack!
Hurry! Put on your ODMG!
Lil!
The enemy's here!
- Lil, let's go!
- Wait!
Defend the explosives!
Too narrow here to fire our anchors!
ODMG troops to the rooftop!
Damn!
Four ahead, you go left.
Will do.
Quit fidgeting, at least die with dignity.
Die!
Come on, move it!
Stop, stop it! I, I...
Just come!
It's all about the explosives!
Defend them at all costs!
This side is gone, retreat!
Come.
Hey, wake up! I said wake up!
Please, wake up...
It's dangerous here, let's go.
Wait!
Will you please treat him?
I'm sorry, but your boyfriend is...
No!
Fukushi...
We have to go.
Let me go! Let me go!
I'll kill them Titans!
I'll kill them!
Let's go.
Hey. Who's driving that?
No one gave you permission!
Thief! He's stealing the explosives!
Stop! Stop! Get out!
Move!
Die, you Titans!
Stop it! Stop the vehicle!
- Why's it on fire?
- Stop it!
There you are!
I'll kill you all!
Get down! Get down!
Fukushi...
How pretty.
But such a waste.
The explosives. That was it!
Don't! You're gonna die!
How could this happen?
This belonged to the thief.
This is hell...
What are you doing here?
Humans are...
Weak, you see.
We'll be eaten.
Now's the chance. Let's run.
What do you call animals that live
inside fences in fear of wolves?
Cattle.
And what are you?
I'm not!
Then go fly.
Then go fly.
I can't! There's no way we're going to win!
Then be that way for the rest of your life!
That bastard...
Damn it.
You can't fear being caught!
Fly right into them!
Fly!
Close one.
Always go back to deliver the final blow.
I'll do it!
You're mine!
Well, sometimes we're unlucky.
Hey!
Hey, look!
Jean!
He only talked big.
Everyone, I have a plan.
Hey!
Pull back.
Hey, big guy! Wanna eat more?
Then try eating me!
You can never eat enough!
What, you clunkhead? You angry, huh?
Mr Souda, please...
Guys...
Come here, Titans!
Come on, you slowpokes!
Now!
Don't mess with me!
Well done!
Good, let's move on!
Where's Eren?
Somewhere up there, dead.
Armin!
Damn, they're not working!
Armin!
Armin!
I won't let you
die here!
Eren!
Armin!
Hiana!
I'm driving you all out.
We're done here! It's full of Titans!
Something's calling them.
- Where's Captain Shikishima?
- Fighting, probably.
Where's the Director General
and the Guards?
They already evacuated.
Don't tell me they used us as bait.
Don't come near!
Hey, get away, Minami!
Minami!
Mikasa.
Eren was eaten.
It was my fault.
I'm sorry.
I'll carve an escape path.
Our task is still to kill Titans.
You can't! You're almost out of gas!
Come!
What was that voice?
What's going on?
A Titan attacking a Titan?
What's happening?
What's with that arm?
It's regenerating so fast!
They're gathering here.
Is he on our side?
His fighting clearly
demonstrates intelligence.
I've never seen this!
It's him...
Mikasa, get back here!
Like hell he's on our side!
Eren?
Is it my fault?
Mikasa.
- You OK?
- Can you stand?
Is he dead? So he's finally out of steam.
He'll evaporate! He's gonna evaporate!
Ow, it's steaming hot!
Cut open his nape,
but don't injure the inside!
What? What're you talking about?
Just do it!
Hurry or he'll be absorbed into the Titan!
The cells will assimilate!
What?
- Is that Eren?
- Eren...
I see.
So that's why the Titans'
weak spot is the nape.

the monsters, lest you become one."

Eren is humanity's last hope.
We're not cattle.
What triggers explosive cell divisions?
They're like-minded comrades.
His consciousness is overtaken by instinct.
We must nip evil in the bud.
This might solve the mystery.
I've been waiting.
I've already given my heart to the cause!
Without me, you'll all die.
I won't abandon anyone any more!
So fight with us!
With nothing to protect, you'll be strong.
I want to know the truth about this world!
You'll die!
You were chosen.
You did that to your own son?
Hurry, go!
As long as we've kept fighting,
we haven't lost!
It's hell outside the Wall!
You were always with me.
Mikasa!
I've waited for this day!
