FRANCE, WORLD WAR II
BRESSON MANSION, SUBURBAN PARIS
- I'm counting on you.
- Okay.
Hey there.
Here.
Let's go.
Well then,
hand over what we came for...
Professor Bresson.
I have nothing to give to you.
Nazi scum!
Oh no!
Hey! Are you okay?
LUPIN III: THE FIRST
YEARS LATER, PARIS
Ladies and Gentlemen!
We have the greatest mystery left by
the renowned Professor Bresson,
the Bresson Diary,
and we are proud to
present it to you here today!
Please take a good look!
They say the person who reads
the diary inside that case
will obtain a vast treasure.
I'm very intrigued.
I've heard that even the
Nazis were after it.
Sir!
We just got advance notice from
Lupin III, he's going to commit a crime!
What did you say?!
"I will make an appearance
to obtain the Bresson Diary."
"Lupin III."
For now, put it in the safe.
I'll take care of it.
Wait.
That face...
Inspector Zenigata! I've captured
the man believed to be Lupin!
Lupin!
You're under arrest!
You came running in here,
and yet you haven't broken a sweat.
Oh my, aren't you observant.
You're coming with me!
Bye!
Hold it!
I'm not letting you get away, Lupin!
Shoot him!
I'll be back! See ya!
After him!
Damn you, Lupin!
Inspector! We should
first put this in the safe!
I'll leave that to you!
You! Escort her.
Yes, sir! This way.
Um...
I'm sorry!
You're... also... a thief?
- Anyone injured?
- I'm really sorry!
Caught a big one!
Sorry, but I'm gonna be taking this.
I never imagined you were
in this trade too, though.
Stop it, are you crazy?
Calm down!
Do you even know the true
value of this thing?
Better than you do, I bet.
Thieving isn't something
you do half-heartedly.
See ya!
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap!
And jump!
A 10.0!
Please, give that back!
Sorry, missy...
But I'm a real thief!
So that's why I'm
gonna be taking this.
Thanks, Lupin!
You did all the heavy lifting.
Dang it, Fujiko, you always...
Lupin!
Pops!
Betrayed by one of your own again?
Get him!
Stay down!
You fools!
He's over there!
And listen, don't let the
female thief get away either!
Lay off!
Oh?
I'm sorry, Grandfather. I failed.
I knew this sort of job
was way over my head.
Useless child.
Nevermind. The backup handled it.
You can just forget about
our little deal we had.
Professor Lambert.
Sir.
Everyone, rejoice.
I've been informed we achieved our long-
felt wish of obtaining the Bresson Diary.
However...
As you all know, the Bresson Diary is
protected by an impregnable mechanism.
No matter what the method,
we must get past it!
She's here, sir.
The woman has arrived.
Sir Gerard.
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.
Here it is. As promised.
Finally, in my hands...
Finally, indeed.
It certainly took long enough.
M-my apologies, sir.
So what about my reward?
Take it.
This is the keyhole, and this
part and this one are interlocked.
Sir Gerard, it is just as
my research showed.
Hold it.
What is this about?
Were you planning to get to the
treasures of Bresson Diary before us?
- Thieving woman.
- Oh my.
Pops...
Isn't this going a bit overboard?
There will be no escaping
for you this time!
The Bresson Diary is said to be the
one time Arsène Lupin was met with failure.
I can understand why his
grandson would want to go after it.
So this is the end for me, huh?
As if!
Here they come!
Stop that car!
See ya!
Come back here!
I said to come back, Lupin!
Ugh, what a hassle.
Ugh, more hassle.
Seriously, what a pain.
Take that, damn cuffs.
What took you so long, Jigen? Goemon?
You should be thankful
we even came for you.
Man, you look pathetic.
Got it off!
Okay, let's pull ourselves together
and go take back the Bresson Diary!
That thing will only
tell us the location
of a treasure
that may or may not exist.
Do it yourself.
Oh, come on! How cold.
So that's how it is, huh?
Fine. Even when I find some
amazing treasure, I'm not sharing it.
What?!
What's wrong?
No, this simply cannot be.
This has to be the
key to the Bresson Diary.
I asked what's wrong.
Well, um...
We're very close, Sir Gerard!
Those words disgust me.
Never say them again!
Worthless fool.
You're... also... a thief?
I told you.
You're not cut out for it.
You're...
- How did you find me?
- Oww!
Well, guess what this is.
Wow, look at all of this.
What do you want?!
Are you after the treasure too?
Treasure? What are you talking about?
The Eclipse. You know, like when
the Moon covers the Sun?
Hey, I saw your eyes light up.
- Did you write this thesis?
- Hey!
Archaeology, huh? I see.
So that's your primary interest.
That's right. I'm not like you.
Archaeology is the only way to find
out the truth about the past.
Look. This is how you talk to the
people who came before us.
But, you know, I'm amazed you
researched all of this stuff.
That's probably the other half of this.
Why do you have that?
I inherited it from my grandfather.
So it was stolen?
Don't make assumptions!
So, tell me.
Where did you see this key?
Calm down a sec...
Um... Can I change first?
Okay?
No peeking!
Um, Grandfather?
Lupin showed up at my place.
He has the same key as us.
I guess... there are two keys.
That explains it.
Listen. This is your
last chance, Laetitia.
Bring Lupin to me,
along with the other key.
Seriously?! I don't want to
work with a thief.
Is that so?
If you succeed, I will reconsider
the arrangement we had.
Let's make a deal.
I'll give you the information I have.
In return, you work with me to solve
the mystery of the Bresson Diary.
Why do I have to work
with a kiddie like you?
Not a chance!
That's too bad...'cause the
other info I have is in here.
I’ve got plenty of ways to get that
information out of you, you know.
You're not that kind of person, right?
Mr. "Greatest Thief in the World"?
Come on, let's work together.
Just like how Bresson did!
Bresson did what?
It's said that he had a partner who
helped finance his excavations.
Are you talking about Hitler?
Don't be ridiculous!
It's said that Bresson
laid down his life to prevent...
the Nazis from obtaining the Eclipse!
Okay, I get it. I see.
But... at the same time,
he also left a detailed clue.
In the form of the Bresson Diary.
Aren't you curious why he did that?
I want to know.
And I want to solve the
mystery of the Eclipse!
Okay, fine.
I'll work with you for now.
Really?
I don't have Jigen
and the gang anyway.
Then, can I ask you
to lead the way, missy?
Yes, of course!
Oh, by the way...
It's Laetitia.
My name. It's Laetitia.
Laetitia?
Are you sure this is
heading to where the key is?
Well, there's no fixed address...
but I know that this supply ship
makes contact once a week.
I still can't trust you.
Laetitia is an alias, right?
An alias?
What are you talking about?
How do you explain this?
LAETITIA,
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY
That's your mother right?
Laetitia's the name of your mother.
My mother is Laetitia.
And I'm also Laetitia.
It's a tradition to name the girls
born into my family Laetitia.
Well, that's pretty lazy.
Well...
Both my mom and dad died in
an accident when I was young.
So that's just what I
deduced from the photo.
What exactly is supposed to be here?
I told, didn't I?
There's no fixed address.
We're about to unlock the Bresson Diary.
All we need now is the other key.
So this is where it was.
- Thanks.
- You're very welcome.
This should be easy for you, right?
You're the famous master thief,
Lupin III, after all.
But of course.
Whoa.
- Success!
- Wow.
At long last. The dream
Grandfather couldn't realize.
What's wrong?
Somehow it makes me feel nostalgic.
Like I've touched this before.
Lupin, we should go.
We won't be able to escape
with these guys on alert like this.
No choice. Let's open it up here.
I had a hunch that you
make a key
by combining these
two pieces like this.
So that's how you're
supposed to use them.
But, the diary won't
open with just the key.
You need a password.
A password?
You see the letters etched in here?
When you use the key, you turn it
to each letter of the password in order.
Or else, look here.
This cocking piece will be
activated and this will explode.
The contents and the person trying to
unlock it will be blown to smithereens.
Bresson must have really
wanted to keep this a secret.
But he wanted someone to open it.
For example, a genius safecracker.
An expert in cryptanalysis.
Someone who loves
treasure more than anything.
Are you talking about yourself?
Now, how do we rearrange these
letters to create a meaningful word?
There are a total of five letters.
This shows that the
password is an 8-letter word.
I see.
Now we've gotta figure out what it is...
Whoa, wait!
What's wrong?! What happened?!
You set off the timing device.
Judging from the looks of it,
it's going to explode in a minute!
You should've told
me from the start
that there was such a thing!
Sheesh!
Calm down!
An 8-letter word
that uses A, E, I, L, T...
Any ideas?
What could it be?! Oh no, what is it?!
A word with a connection to Bresson!
No, it can't be.
No, wait a minute. Could it be possible?
You figured it out?
There's no choice!
Gotta take a gamble.
Wait, do you understand?!
You have to be sure!
- If you're wrong, it'll explode!
- It's going to explode either way.
Let's just go for it!
Wow.
I was right.
Amazing! You're amazing!
Wait, so what was the password?
It'd take too long to explain now.
First, let's take a look inside.
"The Eclipse is a gift
from an ancient civilization."
Impressive! You could read that?
It's ancient Hebrew.
The fact he used such a script
means Bresson wanted an
archaeologist to read this diary.
Now it's written in Scythian!
"If you are unqualified
to receive this gift...
...seal it up once more."
A gift...
I knew it. The Eclipse is a
generator for infinite energy!
"Coudée," that's French.
It means "cubit."
1 cubit is 0.444 meters,
so multiply by that... and you get 39,960.
- So it's about 40 km.
- And this "City of Gods"?
Can't you tell by looking at this drawing?
Teotihuacan in Mexico!
You're pretty amazing.
I told you. This is my field of study.
This time it's written in Akkadian.
"In order to reach the Eclipse..."
I guess there are three trials!
Though, it looks like this tells you
how to get through them...
I see, so that's how it's protected.
Oh?
What's the meaning of this, Laetitia?
I'm sorry, Lupin.
It might be too early to apologize...
...missy.
I told you, thieving isn't
something you do reluctantly.
Why don't you guys come out already?
Or should I go to you?
So you knew we were here, Lupin III.
Well, this was the only way
for me to get here.
But what will you do now?
In this situation,
you're at quite a disadvantage.
I suppose I'll surrender here.
- Hans!
- Yes, sir!
This is what you wanted,
right, Grandfather Lambert?
Oh. Grandfather, huh?
Great work, Laetitia.
Are you guys gonna be able to
solve the rest on your own?
You were stuck at the
entrance for a long time.
Don't be so cocky just because
you're good at puzzles.
Big talk from someone who
couldn't unlock it by himself.
How dare you insult me!
I was once elected as a founding member
of a distinguished research institute!
Oh my! Now you're boasting
about your past accomplishments?
So, what's it called?
What research institute was it?
Ooh, the Ahnenerbe, huh?
The Ahnenerbe?
And what'll you do
after obtaining the Eclipse?
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
We don't need you anymore.
Hans!
Take this petty little thief away!
Yes, sir!
What are you going to do with Lupin?
Don't tell me you've
become attached to him.
Of course not.
He's a thief, after all.
Anyway... I want to talk
to you about something.
What is it?
I did exactly what you asked.
This is the first and last time
I have to do such a thing, right?
You will fulfill the arrangement
we talked about, won't you?
Regarding Boston University, eh?
It's one of the best archeology
institutions in the world.
- The likes of you...
- But I want to test my abilities!
Actually, they've agreed
to let me take their exam.
Stop it with this nonsense!
How dare you go behind my back!
Did you forget
that I took you from
that miserable orphanage
and raised you until now?!
- You ungrateful brat!
- I'm sorry!
I know I can't thank
you enough for that.
But I don't want to steal or
deceive people anymore!
I'd like to study
archaeology in earnest.
I want to become an
archaeologist like Bresson!
You've really grown up.
Once this is done, go to
Boston University or wherever you want.
Do you really mean that?
Thank you, Grandfather!
Yes!
You fear her talent.
What do you mean?
It seems this essay
that we praised so much
is completely plagiarized
from her thesis.
Talent is hereditary after all, eh?
Shouldn't you be the one who
is grateful to her, Professor?
Every last one of them...
How dare they ridicule me!
Oh, Fujiko!
Didn't think I'd run into you here.
Lupin!
Looks like karma got
you for betraying me.
Just shut up!
Hey, no talking! Keep it down.
My, we have a handsome guard today.
Won't you come a little closer?
Well, well. Aren't you a little cutie.
Smooth.
Now that you're here,
this place is gonna become a mess.
You're leaving me behind?
Don't be so cold.
Here.
Good luck.
Couldn't she have put it closer?
There she is!
Thank you for the plane!
What are we going to tell Sir Gerard?
You can tell him you were taking a nap.
Please look at this.
It's just as I predicted.
The Eclipse is a weapon
that has immense power.
It even says how to operate it.
Not bad, Lambert.
Oh, how happy he will be when
he gets his hands on the Eclipse.
"He"?
Could it be? Der Führer... is alive?
You've probably heard
the rumor that der Führer
escaped to South America
that fateful day as Berlin was falling.
I am sure that he is alive.
This is the undeniable proof.
Unbelievable!
That picture was
taken recently in Brazil.
Der Führer and the Eclipse.
The two together could
perhaps revive the Third Reich!
You fool. The revival is certain.
- Laetitia!
- How long have you been listening?
How long have you been listening?!
What is the meaning of this?
You knew that the Eclipse could be
used as a weapon from the start?
"If you are unqualified to receive
this gift, seal it up once more."
"The method for sealing it
is written below."
The Ahnenerbe...
I looked it up and found out that
it was a Nazi research institute.
What are you people planning to do?
What are you doing?
Do the dirty work yourself.
That naive sense of justice...
You raised her wrong.
If we let her live, she'll eventually
get in the way of our plan.
Understand?
If your loyalty to der Führer
is true, you can do this Lambert.
Or can you not do it, Lambert?!
This girl can still be of use to us!
How useless are you?
W-wait!
You idiots!
This is how you talk to the
people who came before us.
Am I falling?
Am I really falling?!
Parachute! Parachute! Parachute!
Parachute! Parachute!
Hey there, missy!
Funny falling into you here.
Lupin!
I'd like to help you,
but I jumped out without thinking.
Why would you even do that?!
Come on, Lupin! Save me!
Lupin!
Hey!
I know I can always
count on you, Fujiko!
It's going to cost you dearly.
Perhaps I can pay you with my body?
Good grief...
Oh, did I offend you?
So persistent!
Hang on tight! Time to lose them.
Go easy on us!
Laetitia!
Nice!
Missy! Jump!
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
What?
Here I go!
What?!
Jigen, how could you?!
Can't you see? My hands were full!
They're back!
There it goes.
Yeah. By the way, why are you guys here?
Fujiko told us that you
unlocked the Bresson Diary.
You were planning on
keeping it all to yourself!
No, no, no, no!
Sheesh. You come only
when there's money in it.
What do we do?
The Eclipse is going to be unleashed!
- Lupin!
- Wait a sec. Let me think.
I guess we have no
choice but to call on him.
What is your plan, Lupin?
There's a guy who would come
for me anywhere in the world.
Hello?
Lupin!
So you've finally
decided to turn yourself in!
How admirable of you
to tell me where you are.
I'll arrest you right now, so stay put!
What the heck is this?
Lupin!
Oops! He saw through it already?
Lupin!
Hold it, Lupin!
See you next time, Pops!
- Inspector!
- Jump!
Lupin!
Not bad for an old-timer!
How do you like that?!
I know it's hard to believe.
Well, Interpol has also been keeping
an eye on the Ahnenerbe's activities.
We've set up a special task force to
combat the resurgence of the Nazis.
I don't think what you've told
me is completely ridiculous.
Those guys are about to
obtain an incredible weapon.
So, let's have a truce for now.
Hey, here! Here!
Never! I will never cooperate with you!
Please!
Trust us.
I'll cooperate with
you in any way I can!
Seriously?
Complete refueling ASAP!
Yes, sir!
What's troubling you?
I was unknowingly helping the Ahnenerbe.
I've even become a thief.
Why did Grandfather do that?
He's not your real grandfather.
Don't be silly.
What are you saying?
You were adopted by
Lambert when you were little.
Do you know why?
Well, that's because
he's my only blood relative.
You were the legitimate heir to the key,
and there was a possibility
you knew the password.
Lambert adopted you
from the orphanage,
and raised you to be an obedient
assistant who steals for him on command.
That's nonsense. What's gotten into you?
It was your name.
L-A-E-T-I-T-I-A.
An 8-letter word
with 5 different letters.
"Laetitia."
The password was your name.
Do you understand what that means?
Your real grandfather was Bresson.
You don't believe it, huh?
Well then, why is the name
that you inherited the password?
The fact is, the Bresson Diary
was unlocked using your name.
But...
Furthermore, your strong
passion for archaeology is proof.
You can't contain it,
even if you want to.
It just wells up, doesn't it?
I'm the same way. It's in our blood.
This is how you talk to
the people who came before us.
Is it true?
Are you really sure I can believe that?
Yeah. I'll bet on it.
I took this when we escaped.
It rightly belongs to you, after all.
I can't... I can't believe this.
If that's true, then
I did something terrible!
Because I was so foolish,
the Bresson Diary is in their hands now.
Whoa, what's this?
How did it get in here?
We will be arriving at
Teotihuacan in about two hours.
That bastard!
The game ain't over yet.
But why didn't Professor Bresson...
er, I mean my real grandfather
destroy the Eclipse himself?
I think he wanted to believe humans
would be worthy of it someday.
What a hopeless romantic!
Lupin, you need to be a romantic
to make it as an archaeologist.
To make it as a thief as well.
Somehow it makes me feel nostalgic.
Like I've touched this before.
My body had already known.
What do you mean?
What a bogus claim it is that
he failed to solve the diary!
It was Lupin I who designed
the mechanism! My grandfather!
This Lupinus flower is associated
with my family name, Lupin.
That means
Professor Bresson's partner was...
Lupin! Laetitia! Let's go!
The two of us meeting could've
been part of their plan!
Then we can't let them down!
40 KILOMETERS NORTH OF TEOTIHUACAN, MEXICO
This symbol! There's no mistake.
This is the Eclipse site!
Hans, you go ahead.
You came all this way
just to get spooked?
Aah! Help m-...!
It seems that it's impossible to
pass without the Bresson Diary.
What are you going to do, Lambert?
The diary was finally unlocked only to
be switched out. What a disgrace!
But, we are so close to the Eclipse!
You've seen what just happened!
Do you seriously think we can manage
to make it all the way
without the diary?
Then what do you want me to do?!
How is it going?
They're on the verge of
having a falling out.
They are heading back to the Swordfish
crash site to look for the diary.
They won't be back for a while.
That's what I was waiting for.
Wow, this is the Eclipse site...
So this is what happens if
you blindly press forward.
The first trial.
The language in which
this text is written
provides a hint for overcoming it.
What language is it?
Akkadian. The Code of Hammurabi is
famously written in Akkadian...
The one that says, "An eye for an eye?"
What's wrong, Goemon?
Look at those eyes.
The eyeball is missing on one side!
That means one of these
eyeballs should fit in there!
You gotta be kidding me.
Let me know when you find the right one.
Huh?! Wh-whoa!
Wh-what just happened?
Ouch.
The creators of the Eclipse
knew how to manipulate gravity.
This isn't the right one either.
How's it going there?
No luck.
Hey, Lupin!
Amazing.
Ouch!
This is great!
How's that?
It appears to be disabled.
This could come in handy.
What does it say?
"The 5th king of the 1st Dynasty of Uruk
saw a dream prior to his
friend's arrival." So it says.
What on earth is this Uruk something?
This one is easy. It's about
the famous King Gilgamesh.
But the dream about his friend...
Oh?
It's a dream about a
star falling onto oneself.
A star? A star falling onto oneself?
What the heck does that mean?
Mr. Jigen!
A star that falls onto oneself.
A meteorite? It must mean a meteorite!
Lupin, pull out your meteorite!
Yes, ma'am! Right away!
Heh, as if I just happen
to have one with me.
Oh, come on! You always have
useless knickknacks in your pocket!
So nothing we can do here, eh?
Oh? Hey, why are
you acting suspiciously?
You shall leave me alone.
I get it. Your Zantetsuken
must be a sort of Ryuseiken.
What are you talking about, Pops?
A Ryuseiken is a sword forged
from meteoric iron.
Is that true, Goemon?!
I know not! Even if that is
the case, I shall refuse.
Please, Mr. Goemon!
No! I shall not lend it to you!
What if the Zantetsuken gets scratched?
Hey, Goemon!
Stop throwing a fit and look!
See?
Thanks!
Goemon! Let's go!
I shall stay behind.
Nonsense! Just hurry on over.
How regretful to use the
Zantetsuken for such a petty chore...
Farewell for now.
I shall return to retrieve you.
- This can't be right!
- What does it say?
The final trial...
"Death's Corridor."
"Use one's physical abilities
to run through it."
Lupin can surely do that, right?
If you manage to run though
this to reach the cathedral...
...it says that it will disable
all the other trials.
Guess I have no choice.
Off you go!
Fine, I'll do it!
Lupin, is that...
Is that Grandfather's?
Hey, what are you...
I think I got this!
Incredible!
Grandfather.
Grandfather, I made it.
Well done.
You really are very good
at solving these puzzles.
You made it back pretty fast. Or did
you forget your lunch or something?
It was only some of our
subordinates who flew back.
It seems we've managed
to fool you pretty well.
Sorry, I let my guard down.
Good grief...
You've got a lot of nerve to tie
up someone from Interpol.
You'll regret this!
Tell me, is that crazy-looking machine
supposed to be the
treasure of the Eclipse?
Well, I suppose it is.
Where are my gold, silver, and diamonds?
This is not what you promised me!
If only I had my Zantetsuken,
we wouldn't be humiliated
in such a manner.
Ah, a gift that the ancient
civilization has left for der Führer!
I've done it at last.
Finally, I've got my
hands on the Eclipse.
Now, Laetitia,
hand over the Bresson Diary.
What are you waiting for?
I refuse to work for you any longer.
I will work only in service of
Professor Bresson, my real grandfather.
It seems you've found out everything.
However, it's too late.
What will happen if it's revealed that
you've stolen the Bresson Diary?
- You made me do it!
- But it's your hands that got dirty!
I've kept all the evidence.
The newspapers and radio
will have a field day.
"Granddaughter of Professor
Bresson conspired with notorious thief."
"Arrested for theft
of the Bresson Diary!"
Just imagine.
- Stop it!
- Give it up!
You are never going to be a
successful archaeologist like Bresson!
You are destined to work
at my bidding for life!
You won't be the one
who'll be in the limelight!
It's going to be me!
The Eclipse has been resurrected!
Now, get up!
- Hey, what're you doing?!
- Wait for us!
Those jerks!
I'm gonna make them pay for this!
Zantetsuken! Zantetsuken!
Zantetsuken! Zantetsuken!
Sit down!
Dammit!
Hold tight, we'll save you!
Lupin! Everyone!
This is the proper way
to use the Zantetsuken!
Fujiko, fall back!
They're gonna use it!
Got it!
Let us find out the
power of the Eclipse!
Keep your eyes open.
Watch Lupin and the others
perish from this earth!
Stop it! Don't do it, please!
Stop!
No!
Dammit!
What is this, Lupin?
Something that will turn
this world upside down.
I need to get in touch with Interpol.
I'm gonna use the radio.
Lupin! Everyone!
Is this some sort of a
micro black hole?
Well done, Professor Lambert!
You'll reclaim glory as
a scholar once more!
Reclaim glory as a scholar?
What a petty thing to go after!
Now that I've gained this much power,
do you think I care for such things?
What?
What a trivial thing
to have been shackled by...
Do you understand
what you've just done?
Now that I've come
to possess the Eclipse,
I don't have any reason
to be faithful to the Ahnenerbe.
You must have lost your mind!
What is that look?
Is that how you look at the person
who took care of you for years?
You ungrateful brat!
That's not true.
You raised me so that
you could use me.
And you finally got to
where you wanted to be.
But these superficial achievements
will be gone in the blink of an eye.
How could someone who
studies history not see that?
At least back at the time when you
saved me from the orphanage,
you studied archaeology sincerely.
But you've changed!
Shut up! Shut your mouth!
Even after witnessing the power I now
wield, you still call me superficial?
Why? Why won't you
recognize my achievements?!
Laetitia, your words have riled me up!
You'll be agonized by the
countless cries and screams
every night for the rest of your life!
What are you up to?
I'm going to destroy the
Ahnenerbe headquarters
together with the rest of Berlin!
The world will tremble in
fear and surrender to my power!
- Are you out of your mind?!
- Who do you think you're talking to?
I am the man who
will be king of the world!
Have you gone mad?
The only man who can wear
the title "king of the world"
is der Führer, Hitler!
What are you doing? Stop it at once!
Grandfather!
- Why did you do that?
- I don't know.
I had thought you
were just a useful tool...
Grandfather!
He was a fool to the end.
It's over.
I'm going to generate a
micro black hole right here.
Your ambition will be lost to the dust!
You wouldn't!
It seems you can't use it
again so soon!
The Ahnenerbe
headquarters to Sir Gerard.
Please transport the Eclipse to
the Brazil chapter immediately.
We've located der Führer!
Der Führer... Hitler!
I knew His Excellency was alive!
He wants to see the
Eclipse as soon as possible.
I knew this day would come! I knew it!
AHNENERBE HEADQUARTERS, BRAZIL
My Führer!
Could it truly be you, my Führer?
You must be Gerard.
Thanks to your efforts, I shall now be
able to see the light of day again.
Thank you for the kind words.
The pleasure is all mine.
So, this is the Eclipse?
With this, I am certain we will
be able to revive the Third Reich.
That's wonderful! Excellent job, Gerard!
Oh, that gun...
You have noticed.
This is a Mauser,
esteemed firearm of the Third Reich.
I remember this...
Such a great pistol...
Y-you insolent fool!
Who is this girl?
She is the granddaughter
of Professor Bresson.
What are you going
to do to this world?
Young lady.
I just want to create a beautiful
world run by a select group of people.
I'm deeply sorry for this utter
disrespect, Your Excellency!
Take her away and deal with her.
You! Take her!
The Eclipse has fallen
into the devil's hands!
Well, let us now have a closer look.
You use these to control it.
This is for the output power.
This is for distance.
I-if you use it here...
I wouldn't use it now!
It's not safe.
I move it this way.
Then this way. Good!
My Führer. Your legs...
Oh my!
It must be a miracle.
...Perhaps?
Why do you look so blue, Laetitia?
Mr. Jigen!
Everyone!
We received word the Eclipse
was activated, so Interpol was deployed.
We seized this location and
transmitted a fake communication
to Gerard, thereby getting
the jump on him.
I really appreciate your
cooperation, Laetitia...
I mean, Miss Bresson!
Yes!
We parachuted down from a jet.
I didn't expect to end up
fighting alongside Pops.
Thus is the way life goes.
Where's Lupin?
It can't be! You're...
It's over now that you
caught me red-handed.
Too bad!
Where is der Führer?
What did you do with him?!
Of course he's been long dead!
Didn't you learn it at school?
He died in 1945.
Then what about this photo?
Sorry to disappoint you,
but apparently
Interpol circulated that faked
photo to see who'd respond.
They sure use some
dirty tricks, don't they?
There is no way I can believe this!
Do not make a fool of der Führer!
Sorry! I removed the bullets earlier.
Why are you doing this?!
Why, I came to destroy this of course!
Thanks for showing me how to use it.
- Ouchy!
- I'll kill you!
How violent.
Oh, I'm scared now!
Why does a petty thief like
yourself have to get in my way?
Well, that's easy.
We thieves love to be
involved in anything fun!
I'm going to kill you!
You'll pay for this! Die!
Success!
Damn you!
It won't stop!
You fool! Are you
planning to kill yourself too?
A parachute! I won't let you get away!
See ya!
You are going to get killed too!
I'll think about that after I kill you!
My Führer!
You bastard!
My Führer...
Here's a little parting
gift for you... Take it.
I finished it, Grandfather.
Lupin! Lupin!
Lupin...
Looks like Lupin pulled it off.
Now I can focus on arresting...
Run!
Those guys!
Lupin! Lupin!
- Lupin!
- Hey! Wait!
You did it, Lupin!
The Eclipse is gone.
No need to worry now.
It was all for the better, right?
Yeah.
Humans are still too
immature to do anything with it.
- Lupin...
- Lupin!
Doing your thing as always, huh, Fujiko?
I swiped these from their warehouse.
I didn't work this
hard to get nothing out of it.
Until next time, Lupin. Take care!
Lupin!
Hurry up! Pops is coming after us.
Oh boy, that man is never
going to give up, is he?
This is where we say goodbye.
You won't take me with you?
You aren't trapped
in a birdcage anymore.
You can fly anywhere.
Coming with guys like us
wouldn't be a good idea.
Lupin...
Just fooling. In truth, I'm a bit tired
of taking care of a fledgling.
That's mean!
I'll see you in five years.
So take care and become
a good woman, okay?
Okay.
Oh, before I forget,
I have to give you this.
An invitation from Boston University?
Why do you have this, Lupin?
Did you send them my thesis?
I stole it from your apartment.
Good luck.
They said they are always
looking for talented candidates.
You... big thief!
Lupin!
So long, missy!
Wait! Come back here, Lupin!
Lupin!
Ha! I got you now!
Oh no!
I WISH TO CONTINUE SENDING LUPIN
ON ADVENTURES WORLDWIDE.
MONKEY PUNCH, JULY 2017
