Jenkins.
Oh, that's original, I've

I can't tell you boys apart,

- Bunch of pinheads.

Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!
I've had him
since he was a puppy.
Here, watch this.
Watch it, huh?
Yeah!
- Alright.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Can I pet him?
- Go ahead.
Hey! Sit, sit, sit.
His name is Boss.
- What's your name?
- I'm Iggy.
- What kinda name is that?
- It's my name.
- How old are you?
- I'm six.
Where's your parents at?
My mommy won't
allow a dog at our house.
Why won't she allow a dog
in your house?
She says that three
daughters is hard enough.
Iggy! What did I say
about disappearing like that?
- What're you doing?
- I'm cuddling Boss.
You sure as hell
better not be Boss.
No, no, he's...
No, he's the handsome one.
You can't just go around
harassing strangers like that.
- Nah, she wasn't.
- I'm not.
Yeah, you were,
you're annoying.
- Nobody wants to play with you.
- Come on, baby, let's go.
Come on.
- He seems to really like her.
- Yeah, well.
- Thanks for lettin' her pat him.
- Yeah, you're welcome.
Come on, let's go baby.
There's a
threat to our people.
And I'm here to say it's not
because we hate anyone else
I don't hate the Jenks,
the niggers
the Muslims or the dykes.
I don't hate them.
They have a right to live.
But we say,
"Not on our American soil!"
Not in our fuckin' life!
So maybe we should just...
make them leave!
- Fuckin' leave!
- Get them the fuck out!
- Make them fuckin' leave!
- Get them the fuck out!
That is why,
ladies and gentlemen,
I have decided
to officially run
for the Ohio House
of Representatives.
Krager! Krager!
Krager! Krager!
Krager! Krager!
- Krager! Krager!
- Hey, you forget?
You forget the last time
you ran for congress,
you left the entire fuckin'
movement bankrupt?
- God bless America!
- God bless America.
Thank you.
Stop your bullshit!
And all your Viking crap!
Alright, let's put
your hands together
for the next generation
of freed America.
We got, Desiree,
Iggy and Sierra.
Less talk more walk girls. I'm

- It's gonna be massive...
No, we're done with this shit.
It's our last gig.
Why?
- Why?
- Yeah.
I don't want my kids
to be around this.
We're just here for a paycheck.
- Got a long drive ahead, huh?
- Yeah.
- Michigan? How long is that?
- Yeah.
It's only a couple of
hours once we're out of here.
You got kids?
Uh, no, just this guy.
Can I have a picture with Boss?
- You want a picture?
- I don't know baby.
You gotta ask his daddy.
Come here, come here, sit!
- Sit. Sit!

There you go.

- Thank you.
- Hey, your welcome.

No.
Can we go home?
If you, uh, if you do

I got my own shop.
Can we go?
- Stop. Stop.
- Come on.
I'm too fucked up.
I don't wanna do this shit.
- No, no, no, I don't...
- Bryon.
- I can make you feel better.
- I don't...
Why don't you let me
make you feel better?
- Bryon. Stop! Fuck you, Bryon!
- Get out! Get out!
Fuckin' tired of this shit.
I want you out.
- No!
- Go! Now!
Police! Open up!
Don't fuckin' move!
Don't move!
Stay down.
Stay! Stay!
- What's goin' on?
- Let's go. On your feet!
Let's go.
Face the glass.
Turn and face the door.
Turn around.
At least 19 injured
people are still in the hospital.
Including this kid.
You morons really banged it out,
didn't you?
Disorderly conduct,
misdemeanor,
assault and battery.
Carrying concealed weapons.
Agent Marks. Bryon Widner.
K is the 11th letter
in the alphabet.
Three eleven's
equals thirty-three
which equals KKK.
Six stands for six generations
of Vinlanders
W for white,
A, alliance.
When the moment comes, you're
gonna be begging me for a deal.
But it's gonna be
too fuckin' late.
Because I got so precious
little patience.
With meathead racist
motherfuckers like you.
This is what I'm offering,
it is a one time deal.
I need a full decode of these
telltale tats of yours.
Names, numbers...
Everything you did.
And didn't do.
And we will have you
moved somewhere.
Far enough.
You'll be looked after.
Okay.
Alright.
Yeah, let me show you.
Just try and get these off.
Here, I can show you.
Just...
I can fucking show you.
Oh, let me get these fuckin'
pants down. There you go.
Alright.
See that?
You guys wanna shoot that?
Get a picture of that?
Do you wanna get a fuckin'
picture of that?
- Got it?
- Yeah, got it.
Get him out of here.
He's a fuckin' corpse.
Love you, guys. Fuck you!
More tattoos on his
face, the more scared he is.
Alright, there.
Let's caption that.
Bryon "Babs" Widner.
Viking Social Club.
What exactly
is your strategy here?
We doxin' him.
We're gonna film these fascists,
we're gonna put it online...
and we out these motherfuckers
to the world.
Make 'em lose
their goddamn jobs.
Confront 'em
everywhere they go.
What's gonna stop
pieces of shit like him
from creatin' more damage?
Guys like this
only have three options.
Die young, life in prison...
or, they start talkin'.
- Let's hope he starts talkin'.
- Fuck that.
There ain't no hope
for motherfuckers like him.
They fucked Lonnie up.
I suggest we do the same.
Come here, man.
Let me talk to you for a second.
Come on.
See that wall?
That's 15 years of work.
A lot of these guys out
are here were just like Babs.
But one by one,
they turned.
See I started this because
I was angry, just like you.
Matter of fact, shit,
I'm still angry.
But all the shit
that they do to us
and nobody seems
to give a damn.
It's that anger that becomes a
part of the emotional tool box
that we use to do this work.
I would also argue that we
can't stay angry forever
because that brings more blood
and more anger
and more blood
and just never stops.
Am I right?
My father...
He was a... a drug counselor
all his life.
He used to have this saying...
"I take human garbage and
I turn it into human beings."
Look, if we can turn
one of these fascist assholes...
so they can see the error
of their ways
then I'll leave a crack
in the door.
Goin' home?
One day,
when you deep sleepin'
we gon' find you
and fuck you up.
You're a monster,
you ain't gonna see shit comin'.
We gon' crack
your head open.
Slice open
your motherfuckin' face.
Just like you did to my son,
you piece of shit.
- Hey! Ma'am! Ma'am!
- He's 14! 14!
Why didn't you let him go?
Why didn't you let him...
Ma'am, calm down, ma'am!
- Answer me! Why?
- Calm down!
Arrest him! Not me!
Don't! Get off me!
I'm comin' for you!
I am comin' for you!
In your dreams,
motherfucker!
In your dreams!
You will never forget
about me!
You better not
close your eyes.
Get off me!
She tried to take
your eyes out and...
You didn't even move,
you should've just kept walkin'.
Somethin' wrong?
Just tired I guess.
♪ You'll be with me
everywhere I go ♪
♪ I'll miss you ♪
♪ I'll miss you ♪
♪ More than you'll ever know ♪
♪ More than you'll ever know ♪
♪ Your love is genuine ♪
♪ Your love is kind ♪

good for you ♪♪
Hey, you in the patches,
come on over here for a second.
Your mom can do better
than that.
Gavin's gonna get molested.
Don't get molested, Gavin!
Watch out.
Oh, can't we just get
out of here? I need to shower.
If your a fuckin' pervert,
I'll smash your face.
Yeah, that's the spirit,
I say death to all pervs.
What's your name, kid?
- Gavin.
- Gavin, come on over here.
- You live around here?
- Jesus.
- You want a beer?
- Oh, fuckin' hell.
Sure.
Gavin, I'm the Hammer,
this is my son, Babs.
You ever hear
of the Vinlanders Social Club?
You watch YouTube,
I got a YouTube channel
called Race and Reason.
Might find it interesting.
Where you from, Gavin?
Pennsylvania.
Social Club's gonna have
a dinner tonight.
Lot of good eats,
why don't you come on over, huh?
Where you thinkin'
of crashin' tonight?
- Just here, with my gang.
- Your gang?
Hey, listen, Gavin,
you wanna join the real deal
and do some real damage?
Not hang out here
and smash bottles
with a bunch
of pussy faggots.
Come on.
- Hey, monkey.
- Hey, Ma.
- How you holdin' up? Yeah?
- I'm good.
I knew they didn't have
shit on you.
I have a clean towel
and some warm lunch for you
waitin' inside.
What's going on?
Ma, meet Gavin.
Find him a room.
She's gonna take
good care of you.
Hi, precious.
Come here.
Why don't I give you
some lunch first, okay?
Yeah? Yeah.
Fatten that baby boy up!
Go inside, hon'.
Come on!
Hey!
Leave my fuckin' dog alone!
- He's my fucking dog!
- He's a fucking Vinlander.
You wanna fucking go again?
Our ancestors
were spilling blood
for the call of the Odin Gods.
And you cocksuckers are acting
like a bunch of Mexican faggots
fighting over a burrito.
Who's the retard behind this?
I asked, who's responsible?
- I am.
- Why'd you do it?
What're you, fuckin' deaf?
Give me a straight answer.
April...
Babs hurt April.
I hurt him back.
Well, that makes a lot more
sense to me then, huh?
Gavin, Slayer has dishonored
himself. Again.
And his Vinlander brothers,
because Slayer
is a worthless,
fathead fuck sack of shit
who I've been trying
to turn into a man
since he was
a stupid teenager.
But obviously, I failed.
And for that reason...
Every time Slayer fucks up,
I am taxing you
you, you and you
a hundred bucks.
Simple as that.
Because in this family,
we don't tolerate stupidity.
Got that?
- Yes, sir.
- I can't hear you!
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!
Now, apologize.
I'm sorry.
Like a real Viking.
Accept my offering, oh,
brother.
Hail.
Hail.
Kid's your probate,
show him around, guide him.
For the rest of you,
dismissed, for now.
Good boy, good boy,
good boy.
Hey.
How you guys, uh,
how you guys doin'?
Well, you know,
we're livin'.
Oh, yeah, well,
it was a very cool photo.
Thank you
for sending it to me.
Hey! Hey! Desi!
Desi! You let her be.
I'm on the fucking phone.
- Is this a bad time? Should I...
- Look, I, uh...
I gotta go cook the girls
some dinner
before they start stabbin'
each other and me.
- So...
- You want me to stop by?
I can stop by if you want.
I can bring, uh,
you sound like you need a beer.
We can just, uh...
Look, I...
I know it's gonna sound
like an excuse, but...
I don't really feel like being
nice to anyone right now.
I just fuckin'
hate being nice to anybody.
So, let's just sit outside,
we can fucking bitch
about life...
Just a couple minutes.
What, you're gonna drive all
that way for a couple minutes?
Yeah, I was supposed to
be in the neighborhood anyway.
- Oh yeah?
- I got a body to bury, so...
So I'll see you later?
Alright, then.
- Uh, gotta go. Gotta go. Bye.
- Okay.
- How's Boss, brother?
- What's your name?
Gavin.
Gavin, you're the lowest form
of life in this club.
My dog holds a higher position
than you do.
I'm your senior VP. You don't
fucking call me brother.
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.
Good,
then get the fuck out of here.
Yes, sir.
- Why'd you get in the truck?
- Sorry?
You heard me, why the fuck
did you get in the truck?
To keep America white.
Keep this country pure.
- Earn my patches and...
- It's alright, cut that shit.
Cut that shit,
what're you doin' here?
- Becomin' a Vinlander.
- So you what?
Shaved your head
and you got the fuckin' shirt
feel like a man now?
Do you?
You feel like a big man?
You gotta stand
like a fuckin' Viking.
Stand like a fuckin' Viking,
be like a man!
- Yes, sir.
- What're you doin' here?
- I was hungry.
- You hungry?
Go back to Pennsylvania,
you fuckin' idiot.
You wanna go for a walk?
Come on, let's go.
Hey, Julie.
- Hey.
- How you doin'?
Good.
- What's goin' on?
- Behind on the rent again.
Uh, yeah, no. I-I know,
I'll, I'll get it to you, I promise.
Look, I got a complaint
from one of the neighbors.
You and your girls
were at a hate rally.
No, no. No, no, no.
It was, it was just a gig, okay?
We're, we're a little short
on cash right now, so...
I thought we had an
agreement about those gigs.
I don't want
any Nazis in my house.
Or in my neighborhood.
You know, people change,
Sheryl.
- Bad timing?
- Perfect timing for a beer.
- Yeah?
- Hm.
Oh.
It's, uh...
It's Boss.
There's the... She could
have it with, you know...
When she misses him.
I found it in a gas station.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
What you lookin' at?
You.
Mom! Mom!
Oh, fuck.
Our five minutes are up.
Got more than five minutes.
Okay. Good job. Okay.
Got it on? Breathe. Okay.
Okay. Slow.
Thanks.
Do you have one
that you regret?
Some.
- What? You got one you regret?
- I...
Hm, maybe.
Let's see it, let's see it,
let's see it.
No.
I wanna fuckin' see it.
Let's see it.
Fuck. Okay.
Danny Lombardo gave it to me.
Can't even look at it
without being sick.
I can fix that for you.
That's fuckin' easy,
that's like...
For me,
fuckin' bread and butter.
So... when was your first one?
This right here.
This, I got it
when I was 14.
And, um... Uh,
Fred gave it to me, actually.
- Fred?
- Yeah, he, uh-uh...
President of the club,
and, um...
So, I was, uh...
I lived with my mom, grow,
growin' up, and, uh,
she had a, a drinking problem,
she passed away,
and, uh,
I moved in with my dad.
Um,
he was a fuckin' drinker too.
Fuckin' horrible fuckin' drunk.
Horrible. The worst.
And, um, I w-went from,
you know,
cleanin' up bottles
to havin' 'em thrown at my head.
Running away constantly, uh,
lived on the streets
for a while.
And, um, Fred took me in.
Picked me up,
put clothes on me,
fed me... got me a job.
Um, I owe him.
- Fuckin' made me, that guy.
- I don't know...
And Shareen too, both.
Okay.
- What?
- I just...
I think real family
don't make you owe shit.
The only responsibility
I have...
are those three girls.
I just want 'em to have
a better life than I did.
Well, you're a good mom.
I don't know about that.
The fuck are you talkin' about?
You...
You're all they have.
- Hm.
- Fuck them.
Fuck those people
who wanna tell you
what to do and how to raise
your own fucking kids.
Fuck them. Fuck 'em!
- Fuck 'em.
- Yeah. Fuck 'em.
Fuck 'em. Yeah.
Fuck them.
- Fuck 'em.
- Fuck 'em.
- What are these scars?
- Nothin'.
What do you mean?
- They're fuckin' nothing. Hey.
- What are they?
Oh, what?
Are we not being honest now?
No, you keep asking, and...
You'll fuckin' find out
what they are
if you keep asking
stupid fuckin' questions
that's for sure.
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm.
- What are you gonna do to me?
- I gonna fuckin' cut you.
- With my fuckin' razor.
- Hm...
I'm gonna make you bleed.
And then I'm gonna
fuckin' lick it off you.
That's what I'm gonna do. I'm
gonna fuckin' lick it off you.
- Is that a promise?
- Yeah, it is.
Yeah?
Ooh.
Desi, I wouldn't be here
if I didn't see potential
in this, okay?
- Oh, yeah.
- Try it today.
Just, just give me something,
yeah?
- I'm trying.
- You're not trying.
He's actually trying.
Okay, guys!
Come on! Calm down.
She's throwing popcorn at me,
I can't help it!
Just try.
- Hot dog.
- There she goes again.
And on three, two, one...
Fuck you too, mom.
There you go.
That's how you do it.
- I got something for you guys.
- Ooh! Oh.
- This is for Iggy Pop.
- Yay! Thank you.
- Sierra.
- Thank you.
- And Desi.
- Thanks.
Open it, open it, open it,
open it, open it, open it.
Oh, it's so cute!
What you doin', huh?
What you doin'?
I don't think she likes it.
You guys wanna go surfing?
Wow!
I'm gonna show you.
- Drive okay? Yeah?
- Yeah.
Good.
This is it.
- Awesome.
- It's cool.
Wow. This is incredible.
So what?
Are all these yours?
Yeah, the ones top left. Yes.
- You are talented.
- I wouldn't go that far.
- How much do these go for?
- Uh, those ones there...
Three-fifty-four, and...
Starting from there.
- Wait, seriously?
- Uh-huh.
Wow, you must make good money.
Well, it all goes to the club,
but on a good day,
bring in about 1200, 1500,
somethin' like that.
- Hey, can I get this one?
- No.
No, no, we spoke about this.
Not till you're 18.
Yeah, I got somethin'
for you guys, hang on.
You guys like transfers?
They're like fake tattoos,
basically.
Here, Sierra.
You try this before?
- Oh, they're pretty.
- Just put 'em on your arm...
- Don't fuckin' touch me.
- Hey, Des.
- Where you goin'?
- Air.
Don't go far, okay?
We're leaving in an hour.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's alright, it's alright.
- Can you draw?
- No.
Oh,
I hope you like the rainbow behind it.
I felt so bad when she...
I'm sorry, listen...
- No, I thought it would be cool.
- No, ignore it.
She's not a kid anymore.
She had it rough
when she was a kid.
Did something happen to her?
Wait, was it that fuckin'
douchebag, what's his name?
- Danny Lombardo.
- That's the one.
Yeah, a piece of shit
to give me that?
What'd he do?
I came home early
from work one day,
found him in her room
beating the shit out of her.
Told myself no one will ever
lay another hand on my kids.
No one.
- Hey, doll, is that car yours?
- My mom's.
You're Babs'
friend, aren't ya?
- My mom is.
- And she dragged you down here?
This is the last place you
wanna be stuck in, huh, doll?
- Yeah, kinda.
- Yeah.
Are they inside?
Yeah, he's givin' her
a tattoo or somethin' retarded.
You're Desiree from Sid's?
Yeah, you've got the voice
of an angel, babe.
I'm Shareen.
You can call me Ma.
Nice to meet you.
Hey, do you have a lighter?
Hm. Sorry, rude of me.
- You first.
- Thanks. I'm not allowed.
What do you mean,
you're not allowed?
- Who's not allowing you?
- My mom.
Your mom's not allowing you?
I'll tell you what,
I'm the owner of this place.
And I'm allowing you
to do whatever you want,
so, how about that?
You got very delicate skin.
- Oh, yeah? You like it?
- I love it.
Yeah.
What's the verdict?
- It's pretty strong.
- Mm.
You like her?
- Yeah, she's cool.
- That's Freya.
Goddess of love and death.
You know,
she slayed the souls of sinners
killed in battle,
so they could feast in Valhalla?
That's how cool she is.
Mm-hm.
She's all yours, precious.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
You got her killer eyes
and her gorgeous hair.
Thanks.
Shit. I gotta go.
Hey.
First one's on us, doll.
- How're they doin' back there?
- I don't know.
- Are they alright?
- Yeah, I think they are.
- Come on, go fast!
- Go faster!
Hey!
Whoo!
- Ready?
- Hands off the wheel!
Not even driving!
Not even driving!
Finally.
Think it came out pretty good.
Oh, my God. This is incredible.
- You know what it is?
- What?
It's a black bat flower.
It's beautiful.
This is a fuckin' great job,
yeah.
Hey. Hey...
You like it?
I like
when you're a part of us.
- I wanna be inside you?
- Yeah?
Yeah. I wanna be inside you.
Come on. Let's go here.
Ah. This is it.
Iggy, what do you think
about my look?
You like it? Maybe should've
put some blood on it.
But you're a skeleton,
skeletons don't have blood.
Yeah. You girls excited, huh?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Looks good.
Just your friendly
neighborhood documentarian.
It's the Antifa welcoming party.
- Shut the fuck up, Jenkins.
- Alright.
Y'all have a nice day now.
- Put this on.
- Okay.
Got it? Hold my hand.
Happy Halloween!
- How y'all doin'?
- Hey, don't film the kid.
Hey. Oh, shit,
is that you, Babs?

Yeah, hey, Des.
This is their mom, Julie.
Hey. Heard a lot about you.
I bet you have.
Hey, girls, why don't you

You're not into Halloween?

I have to, I have to...
I'm an idiot, what am I doing?

Mom, tell me what's going on?
Just take this, take this...

- Get off of me.
Iggy, I know, baby.
You have to go. Go.

I came here for you, for this!
It's not gonna change
our fucking lives!
Julie! Fuck.
Julie.
Stop. Stop, stop. Fuck. Stop!
Hey. Hey!
Come back, Julie!
You have to trust somebody
at some point, you know that.
Yeah, it sure as hell
ain't starting with you.
The fuck was that back there?
We got in a fight. It's none
of your fuckin' business.
You ain't got time
for that shit.
Hey, did she tell you
her old man
back in Wisconsin was
with the Klan in the old days?
She tell you that?
She didn't mention
that to me, no.
Yeah, he was a goddamned rat.
Dropped the patch.
What's the kid doin' here?
He's earnin' his reds tonight.
- Aren't you, son?
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Gavin,
why don't you give Babs a beer?
Loosen the fuck up.
Alright, let's go. Go.
Fuck outta here!
Let's go! Move, let's go!
Come on, come on, move it, man!
Go, go, go, go on.
Shit!
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Gimme that!
One People's.
You have a collect call from...
Bryon Widner.
To accept this call, press one.
Hello?
Hey, how you doin'?
Can you hear me?
- It's me.
- I'm listening.
Listen, I, uh, I quit.
How do I know
you're telling the truth?
You really
think I'd be calling you
if I was still in this shit?
That kid from the
rally, is he okay?
Why do you wanna know?
Because I feel
fuckin' sick about what I did.
Yeah, you should.
That's a start.
Let's just say he's got some,
uh, good people around him.
I tried burnin'
my fuckin' face off.
That didn't work.
I don't know what to do.
Look, you know I can help you
but it ain't for free.
I need information.
About your Viking family.
Hey, girls, don't forget
to pack the closet, okay?
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Boss!
Mom,
can we get this thing out of here?
You look like shit.
I just came to say
that I'm sorry.
- And?
- And we took off.
We left. It was just him
and these bags.
That's it. That's all I got.
Yeah, well,
I don't trust you.
I get it, but I'm gonna do
whatever it takes...
to prove it to you
I'm not gonna fuck it up again.
I'm not.
- No.
- Julie. Hey, wait!
Julie! Julie, wait! Julie!
We burned down a mosque
in Toledo.
And there was people inside.
And it felt fuckin' sick.
It felt fuckin' wrong.
I just want it all
to be fuckin' over.
I am never fucking
goin' back there, ever.
I am out.
What are Ma and Pa
gonna think about that?
Real family
don't make you owe shit.
Don't...
Don't do that!
Don't do it!

- Bryon Widner.
- Uh, yeah, it's me.
Can I be honest?
You're on the FBI watch list.
I-I just don't...
I can't help you.
- Nothing?
- No.
Like nothing.... There's
nothing at all in the system?
There's nothing I can do?
Hey.
Thanks.
I just wanna say, uh, thanks
so much for helpin' us out.
- I appreciate it.
- It's workin' out, right?
- All good. Yeah.
- Good.
- What's going on?
- I tried calling you.
- You didn't answer.
- Oh, I didn't hear it.
- Hail, mother earth.
- Hi, Ma.
You look like shit, sweetie.
Hey.
Come on, relax.
Nick, get him a beer.
Sit down.
Freddy, did you see this?
Oh, my...
I fuckin' knew
there was a wedding.
I knew it. I told you.
Right?
It smells so shitty in here.
Hi, baby. Stop it! You!
Stop being so cute. Cutie.

It's just a temp job,

But y-you got a job.
You tat people, we pay for it.
Well, now, the plan is to open
my own tattoo shop soon, so...
- Really? That's the plan?
- Working for that, yeah.
Honey, you ain't built
to run your own business.
Baby, you're an artist.
Who you basically use
for your own...
I wasn't talking to you, was I?
I was talking to my son.
You're not even
his real fuckin' mother.
- Julie.
- Do I even fucking know you?
Oh, yeah, hey. Nice to meet you.
I'm Julie, Bryon's wife.
- Remember?
- Yeah?
What kind of wife
sends her husband
to pick up shit with illegals
in the middle of...
The same fucking wife
who has to make a living.
You're gonna let her trash-talk
your mother like that?
Pa, you think you can
give us a minute?
Please.
What the fuck?
Why the fuck are they here?
- I don't know.
- What the hell?
- I'm calling the cops.
- Don't call the cops.
- Why not?
- Just let me talk to 'em.
Let me find out what they want.
Just take the kids to school.
- I'm not leaving you alone.
- I dunno what's gonna happen.
I don't know
what they're gonna do.
You need to get the kids
and get outta here.
- It's not safe for them here.
- Fuck.
Let's go.
- I'll be fine.
- You fuckin' better be.
You come back to me, okay?
I promise I'll be alright.
- Hurry.
- Bye, bye, Iggy.
I'll see you guys after,
okay?
Nick.
Hey.
- Come on, you know the drill.
- Yup.
Just for security reasons,
you know?
- So what, are you dodging us?
- Nope.
You left the shop.
You don't answer your phone.
You don't show up
at meetings anymore.
You haven't paid your dues. I
don't even know if you remember.
- What do you call that?
- I was just here.
I was working my ass off.
Working your ass off.
We think it's time for you
to come back home, kiddo.
You drive down here
to tell me that?
No.
You see, the cops back home,
they found
four illegals hiding
in the field behind that mosque.
Now, it turns out, they were
working construction that day,
sleeping inside
a storage room
inside the mosque
when we burned it down.
But somehow they got away.
Fuckin' miracle, right?
All the boys, they say
you were the last to leave.
Mm-hm.
All I wanna know, Babs,
is...
What the hell is going on?
What do you mean?
Because we got the Feds
showin' up at the shop
and six Jihadis runnin'
around town jeopardizing
an entire movement.
I didn't see
any fucking illegals.
- If I saw any fuckin' illegals...
- You're lying.
- I didn't see any illegals.
- You're a fucking liar!
No, no, no, because I had to
burn the motherfuckers alive.
- He's lying.
- Are you... Are you crazy?
- And this fucking wedding.
- Oh, my God.
This whole shit!
It's a fucking cover!
She's my wife! A cover?
Are you fucking insane?
You've been listening
to this little bitch?
He can't even fuckin' read.
You don't like
the fuckin' match
because your hands
were shaking...
Alright, no, no, no!
Ey, settle down!
- Fucking stop!
- Sit down!
I want a word with my son.
Get the fuck out.
You can't keep runnin' away
from us like that.
You can't.
You can't do that.
Pa needs you. I need you.
- I'm not going back.
- No, you have no choice.
- I'm not going back.
- Otherwise...
They're gonna think
you're hiding...
I fucking live here!
This is my fucking family!
I'm done with this crap! I'm
not gonna be like that anymore.
- Son?
- Hm.
I promise you... I will not
let them touch my baby boy.
Okay? I promise you that.
But I am so scared
for these girls.
Look familiar?
Shut the fuck up!
I never fuckin' seen this...
They eyeballed your ass, Babs.
- They can't testify.
- I've never seen this...
I've never seen these people
before in my life.
- Take it, Babs.
- I swear to God.
- I've never seen these...
- Take this screwdriver.
And finish 'em off.
- Come on.
- Are you fuckin' dumb?
Hm? Take a closer look
'cause they definitely saw you.
They're fucking kids.
That's a kid.
What are you talking about?
They're Hajis.
Clean up your fucking mess.
I'm not doin' it.
I'm not...
Go ahead.
I'm not fuckin' doin' it!
You're gonna have to kill me!
Go ahead! Do it!
Go ahead, just fuckin' do it.
Just fuckin' do it
'cause I'm not doin' that.
Go ahead.
You fuckin' pig.
Whatever!
Fucking Christ!
What the fuck are you doing?
Oh! Oh, fuck!
Fuck me.
That little bitch isn't dead.
Get up and finish
your fucking mess.
Oh,
you fuckin' piece of shit.
Get the fuck up
and finish the fucking job!
Get up, you little faggot!
Fuck you!
You fucking piece of shit!
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fucking number two!
Fuck you! You fucking
little shit! Fuck...
Babs! Babs!
What the fuck, Slayer?
Alright,
I think we get the point.
Alan, Nick, take Babs in.
Finish off the Hajis
and burn 'em.
Let's wrap this fucking
party up and go home.
Nobody fucking move.
Get back in the truck.
What?
You made the fucking rules,
boss.
Babs dropped
the fucking patch.
Bryon has to go.
He'll go when I decide.
I'm not your fuckin' monkey.
And I'm tired of you
calling me stupid names.
And backing up
with this fucking traitor!
Slayer, I hear you.
I know you're angry.
Let's, let's just go home
and solve this.
Okay, pumpkin?
Please, put the gun down.
I hear you.
I know you're angry.
You know what?
It's time for the old fuck
and her majesty to step down
and let the young folk
take the lead.
You boys?
Because we cannot stand
your fucking attitude anymo...
Congratulations, son, you just
earned yourself a second patch.
Kid's got more balls than
the rest of you fucking faggots.
Alright, clean it up.
Oh, God! Bryon? Baby?
Listen, I can't really talk.
He's at Toledo Hope.
Get here fast
before they kill him.
Get here. Get here now.
I've only been to a
hospital two times in my life,
the day I was born and the day
Ma went into labor.
When finally I got here...
I just knew it was over.
No heartbeat.
No nothin'.
And Ma...
She had to go through labor
and deliver a still baby
with the cord
wound around his neck.
Took us a whole year
to get back to ourselves.
We didn't dare
get attached to
anything that was ours again.
Babs, you're more
than a son to us.
Ma and I, we made
a real investment in you.
But in this business...
you've gotta stay focused
or... fall...
right down the rabbit hole.
You're still breathing
because I own you.
And every inch of ink on you.
The only way anyone else
gets access to your trophies
is if I ask them out myself.
So who is it?
Feds? Jenkins?
SPLC?
What'd you give 'em, son?
Hm? Hm?
What do they know about us?
Huh?
What do they know?
Bryon Widner.
Oh, baby.
Hey.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Mm-hm.
I'm here. I'm here.
Here. Here.
Here.
- Are you sure?
- Mm.
- Babs?
- Just Bryon, yeah.
I don't really go
by Babs anymore.
Oh, good.
Never liked that name no way.
Look.
I wanna help.
But the Feds need
your full cooperation
on this thing, Bryon.
Okay?
There ain't no deal without it.
I just wanna know where we're
gonna go,
where we're gonna live. Where
the... What about the girls?
Look, man, look, all of that
is classified, okay?
Even I won't know
unless you want me to.
Well, what about school
for the girls?
- They will be taken care of.
- I see.
I promise you that.
It's been a hard time.
I mean, yeah,
especially for...
- The little one.
- Yeah.
Well, look, man.
Look, you have an out,
Bryon.
I can help you.
Your birth certificate
and your arrest sheet
will be the only signs
that you are still alive.
Alright?
Other than that,
you'd just be
some... average nobodies
in this country.
I'm not exactly fucking average,
I mean, look at me.
You've got a point there.
Okay.
Here's the thing.
I wasn't gonna say anything
because I didn't wanna get
your hopes up.
Alright?
There's this wealthy old lady
that works with the SPLC.
Now... she's been working there
for years.
They asked her
if she'd put up the money
to remove the tattoos
from your face.
She heard about your story.
She was moved.
We'll have another meeting.
They're gonna talk to her.
She said she may be interested.
Now, again...
It's, it's a chance.
Who is she?
Keeps it anonymous.
I understand the place
you're in right now. I do.
See this? Defiant Nation '92.
- No shit.
- Yeah.
And if I told my old lady
I wanted out,
she would have told
everyone else
and they would have
murdered me and my kids.
So what did I do?
I kidnapped my own sons
and I filed for legal custody
and I started talking.
Now, I didn't even have
what you got here.
When?
Be at this hotel
tomorrow night.
It's an eight-hour drive.
Under the name "Manning."
It's safe.
Talk to no one, okay?
I gotta go.
What if I take all this
stuff off
and I'm still a piece of shit?
There's only
one way to find out.
Is there anything
else for the girls?
There's a box for the girls
here.
What about Boss's box?
Do you have that?
Uh, what do... H-he needs to go
out. Did he go out yet?
- I thought you took him out.
- I didn't take him out.
Okay, he's with the girls.
I'll grab him.
Come on, Boss, let's pee
in the night. Come on.
Good boy. Let's go. Good boy.
Come on.
Go get it, go get it.
- Okay, this box is done.
- Babe...
Girls! Girls!
Get to the bathroom now.
Just like the drills.
Oh, my God.
Julie...
You okay?
Stay down! Stay down!
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Come on, now.
Hold it, stay there!
Stay there...
Baby, where are you?
Oh, God.
Bryon...
Bryon, where is she?
- Baby!
- Get back, get back.
You're okay, you're okay.
Remember that time I took you
to that restaurant?
And this started happening,
I took you outside
and we-we were on the bench.
And it worked, right?
Okay, okay,
let's do that again.
Here, let's do that again.
You got it? Okay.
Oh, you got...
You okay?
You feeling better?
Yeah?
Okay.
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.
- Yeah? You sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Okay. Okay. Sierra?
Oh, Jesus Christ.
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.
Motherfuckers.
Fuck!
No, go-go back inside. Go...
Don't let the kids come out.
Go ba...
- Go back inside!
- Desiree!
Desiree, get the girls inside!
Get them inside!
Oh, shi... Shit! Fuck!
Oh, I'll fuckin' kill...
Oh, I'll fuckin' kill...
Fuck you!
You fucking cowards!
I got you, baby.
Yeah, I got you.
I got you.
We're gonna be okay.
Okay, baby?
I don't know what
we're gonna do.
It's okay.
Wait, there.
Wait.
You okay?
Okay.
Hey. Hey, baby.
You okay? Come here.
Oh...
Okay.
Okay?
Don't answer it! Don't a...
Do-don't pick it up.
Don't pick it up. Leave it.
Leave it. Leave it.
- Babe, I know...
- Let it ring, let it ring.
- Don't pick it up.
- I know.
Just let it go.
Let it, let it ring.
Hey, what are you doin'?
The pool.
Half an hour only, okay?
Stay where we can see you.
Be right back.
- Desi. Desi, get out.
- What for?
Just get out,
I need to talk to you.
Where'd you get that tattoo?
- Black Eye Social.
- You're lying.
- I know what that means...
- What are you talking about?
- This is Freya.
- So who you talking to?
I'd never get one
of your stupid designs.
No, no, no, no, no...
It's a Norse Goddess, you idiot.
Are you talking to them? Is that
how they know... How th...
- Is that how they...
- I didn't do anything wrong.
Is that why they keep
showing up...
I'm not lying,
I didn't do anything wrong.
- Who did that to you?
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- Hmm?
- Black Eye Social.
I didn't do anything wrong.
It's a Norse Goddess.
Hey! Bryon!
If you can tell me
where we're going...
Help!
- Is that why they keep...
- Help!
- Get off me!
- Stay there, baby.
- Ah! He's hurting me.
- Hey, buddy, you're hurting her.
I'll fucking kill you, huh?
You're gonna fucking get
in the middle of this, huh?
You wanna fucking get
in the middle of shit, do you?
Fucking stay right there!
Fuck!
Fucking telling
you this is what
they fucking do, okay?
No...
Get away from her!
- Stop!
- She's a teenager!
Why do you think
they keep showing up?
I don't care.
I don't fucking care.
Get away. Get away from us.
You're fucking insane.
You're crazy.
She's terrified of the...
I got her that fucking tat.
Wait, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, I didn't...

I told you...
You fucking
lay a hand on my kid...
You lay a hand on my child,
I'll fucking kill you.
