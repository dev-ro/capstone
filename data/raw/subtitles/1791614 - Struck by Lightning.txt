I always thought
death would be different.
I expected a great wave of
realization to sweep over me.
Suddenly, the meaning of life
would be answered along with
every other question
I ever had.
But there was
nothing to realize.
I was dead.
- What?!
- Are you Sheryl Phillips?
What, did I forget to put my
trash bins away or something?
No, ma'am. Your son has died.
His body was found in the school
parking lot this morning.
A few days ago,
right here where I'm standing,
clover high school senior
Carson Phillips lost his life
when he was struck by lightning.
A service will be held this Sunday
at clover community chapel.
He will be missed.
# It's so hard #
# to say goodbye #
# to yesterday ##
And... My funeral sucks.
Goodbye, Carson.
You've seen my end.
But where do I begin?
I remember when I realized I was
different from everyone else.
My name is Carson.
My mom says I was named Carson
because that's what was on TV
when I was conceived.
When something takes away something
else, what do we call that?
- Not addition, but...
- Homicide.
I was advanced at a young age.
Most of the founding fathers
were closeted homosexuals
and slave owners.
My reports were always
more thorough than my peers.
I'm serious.
I remember when I discovered
the power of words
and how easy it was to escape into
a world of my own by using them.
It was a pleasant environment.
Three sheets to the wind, too.
You're already.
At least leave me one beer.
Carson, this is the last time
you'll ever see your grandfather!
- I know what he looks like!
- Stop fighting me!
Stand up.
- Boo!
- Ahh!
What the hell
is wrong with you?!
It was lame. I know, I know.
The kid's a puss.
I remember the day
grandma came to live with us.
Grandma!
It's the fifth time
you found her
wondering around town.
Oh, mom.
And now
she's in the linen closet.
Your bedroom is the next door.
And the day
that grandma got sick.
- I wrote you a story, grandma.
- Oh, let's see.
"Once upon a time,
there was a boy."
Well, it could use
a little development,
but it's a great beginning.
The whole neighborhood
remembers the night
that dad left.
We just started going back to counseling.
You can't just do this.
Yeah, well, I'm leaving.
I can't take this.
- Where are you going?!
- Anywhere but here.
- That's mine!
- That is not yours.
I...Thank you.
You can't come back!
No!
I hate you!
I hate you!
Screw it.
If anyone asks, we're Jewish.
It's been me and mom
ever since.
Mom, wake up.
You passed out again.
- Wake up, mom.
- Oh, Jesus!
Congratulations.
You survived the night.
Oh, Jesus. If you were descent,
you would just let me sleep.
If I was descent,
I'd just put you to sleep.
My God. My head.
You know, the morning
isn't supposed to hurt.
I don't have to go to school.
Why do I have to get up?
Here.
Are you sure
you're supposed to be drinking
with all those pills
Dr. Diehler's giving you?
Dr. Wheeler. Why don't you just
leave that to the professionals?
Can I have my other glass
back, please?
It's in the sink.
Get it yourself.
You know, you make me wish I'd
had that abortion in the '90s.
- That makes two of us.
- Go to school already!
Go! Go! Go!
And if I am still sleeping
when you get home,
don't you dare put my hand
in a bowl of water again.
Shut up.
Bye. Love you, too.
Would you bring me
my pillow back?!
Close the shades.
I hate you.
High school.
Society's bright idea
to put all their aggressive,
self righteous, pubescent, naive
youth into one environment
to torment and emotionally
scar each other for life.
Cattle, cattle, cattle, cattle!
Shakespeare once wrote
that life is but a dream.
And that's exactly
how I lived my life,
from one dream to the next.
Hating every update of reality.
Well, the "I" stands for
an imaginary number.
Okay, hold up. There are
imaginary numbers now?
Are there unicorns the next lesson?
Can someone please
teach me something useful,
like how to balance a checkbook?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why did I get a "c" on this?
- This is a great paper.
- The assignment was to pick
either evolution or creationism
and provide background evidence
as to why
you believe that theory.
I know. I picked evolution.
I said that it's obvious creatures
can adapt to their environments
because I no longer
have the urge to throw things
at students
who believe in creationism.
Right?
Right?
I believe in creationism.
Exhibit "a."
Welcome to career day
here at the counseling center.
Right, I'm sure
you saw our flier.
And you know, we're here to
just sort of help you kiddos
establish your future career
options, what do you want to do...
I know the exact career
that I want.
Okay. What is it, munchkin?
I want to be the editor
of the New Yorker
and the youngest freelance
journalist to be published
in the New York times, LA times, Boston
herald, and the Chicago tribune.
You have had some time
to think about this then, huh?
- Every day since I was eight.
- Okay. Well...
What about college? I can help you
decide what college to go to.
Uh, no. I've got
to get into Northwestern.
All right.
Where is that exactly?
- Illinois.
- Never heard of it.
I've put 17 good years
into this town, okay?
People spend less time
in prison for murder sentences.
- Is that true?
- Yes. Yes, look it up.
I've been the president
of the writers' club
and the editor of the newspaper
since sophomore year
just to better my chances
of getting into that school.
That is so smart.
- Wow.
- It's been challenging.
So I've already applied
and I meet all the requirements.
I just haven't
heard back from them.
So I'd appreciate it if you um,
maybe found out why.
Okay. And that is something that I would do?
I would call them?
- Yes.
- Okay.
I will do anything
to get into that school.
- I mean anything.
- I'm on it.
But since you're here,
how 'bout you just fill out this
clover community college
application.
'Cause with every application,
I get a point
towards a juice cup.
Ahem. Do you juice?
Because it's really
changed how I feel.
Last week's edition of
the clover high chronicle
was yet another disappointment.
We did have new material
for each of the sections,
but once again, it was
all written by me.
Now this, this has to stop.
This is not the
Carson Phillips chronicle.
All right? It's the
clover high chronicle.
Carson Phillips. Clover high.
Hopefully,
this week will be different.
Dwayne! Do you have that movie
review ready for manslaughter 3 yet?
- Yes.
- Yeah?
- No.
- No.
I went, but I passed out.
You didn't tell me
it was gonna be in 3d.
- It wasn't.
- Whoa.
Vicki. Do you have
your weather report ready?
- What?
- Your weather report.
Yeah, it's cloudy.
Okay. Thank you, Vicki.
Progress, right?
And uh, Emilio,
do you have a section
you'd like to tackle this week?
Uh... I love America.
Okay. Great.
I love the aphorism.
We'll create a patriotic
section just for you.
Now.
Moving onto creative writing.
Does anyone have any
- short stories or...
- Yes, I did write
- a short story.
- Fantastic. Let's hear it.
Um...
This is written by Malerie.
"It was the best of times.
"It was the worst of times.
It was the age of wisdom."
Malerie. You didn't write that.
Yeah, it's in my handwriting.
But um...
If you don't believe me then...
Please come back tomorrow
with something, with anything.
And don't forget that there's
a writers' club meeting
in case any of you
change your mind
about wanting to join.
Or change your personalities.
There was never anything
to do in clover...
Besides jamba juice
and cow tipping.
There's no "h" in suck!
So to entertain ourselves,
we all became
diehard club members.
We had the cheerleaders.
She smells like gluten.
Yearbook club led by
the human mosquito known as
- Remy Baker.
- No!
I don't want any fatties on
the back to school night page!
I don't want to expose
my grandchildren to a bunch of
obese sophomores...
By body is sacred.
The celibacy club.
It's time that we're treated
like the treasures that we are.
And, five, six, seven, eight!
There was the drama club.
Always written, directed,
and produced by Scott Thomas.
Okay. I've been giving
this a lot of thought.
Meryl Streep as mama rose.
- Thoughts? Thoughts?
- Yeah, it's done.
Hugs. Hugs.
And then the athletes.
Boys, can you freeze fire?
Hot stuff, can you freeze fire?
Yes.
Well, um...
Have you seen the movie
the last airbender?
No. I sleep with girls.
Oh. Um, well, you know...
In certain dimensions, yes.
You just
completely blew my mind.
Can I get a close-up
of your bicep?
And of course,
worse than detention,
the writers' club.
Hi, Malerie.
I wrote another
short story for the chronicle.
Great. Let's hear it.
It's um...
This one,
I think you're gonna like it.
It's probably my best one.
Call me Ishmael.
Some years ago,
never mind how long precisely...
Malerie.
Did you really write this?
No.
You saw right through me.
I'm a complete disappointment.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
I mean, writing takes time.
Your own words would help, too.
But I can't think of
any ideas myself.
Like, I have no imagination.
All God blessed me with
was this flawless complexion
and really good
table tennis skills.
I'm like, Asian good.
How do you do it?
I...
Uh, well, I don't...
Don't try to find the ideas.
Let the ideas find you.
It's one of the most
amazing experiences.
You know, finding something
to write about or uh...
Realizing something
for the first time.
It comes out of nowhere
and then it just hits you
and it's all
you can think about
and it goes through your body,
and it tries to escape and, and
be expressed
in any way possible.
I mean, it's uh...
- It's a lot like um...
- Lightning.
Yeah, yeah.
Exactly.
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah. Well, don't worry.
You'll find something
to write about soon.
Attention
student council members.
There's a meeting
in the activities office.
They only have these meetings
when they think I've gone home.
The joke's on them.
I never go home.
Yeah, either do I.
'Cause home is overrated.
So is M&M's world.
Seriously.
I often fantasized
about various torture methods
I would rather have been
experiencing than sitting in a
- student council meeting.
- And I'm happy to report
that there will be enough trailers
and trucks for all the clubs
to have floats at homecoming.
It was run
by our student body president
Claire Mathews.
You know, that girl.
The one that
probably shits cupcakes.
And as excited as
we all are about homecoming,
we need to choose a theme
for the Sadie Hawkins dance.
It'll be here
sooner than we think.
- Okay, any ideas?
- "Fun under the sun."
That screams
"skin cancer" to me.
It would be fun.
It's an excuse to wear flip
flops and bikinis to school.
Yes.
What about
"one night in Paris"?
My family and I went over the
summer and it was beautiful.
Ab fab idea.
If we go all out,
it might run us over budget.
So Nicholas, do you think
your dad could cover it?
He's never
turned us down before.
Okay, "one night in Paris."
Like the sex tape?
- Come on.
- Okay, fine.
Let's go with something
a little bit more generic
like "under the sea."
It was the theme
of my parents' school dance.
Well, if you're
not going for originality.
- We aren't.
- Great.
Everyone can bring their crabs.
I hate you more than
I hate the holocaust.
Bite me, hobbit.
Sorry. We don't have
to listen to him.
He's only here because he's the
editor of the stupid paper.
Why do you even care? It's not
like you go to anything anyway.
- Because they're stupid!
- Okay, fine!
Then you choose a theme,
Carson!
Okay. Um...
You all like TV, right?
What about
famous television couples, huh?
People could be um,
Fred and Wilma,
Mulder and Scully,
uh, Lucy and Ricky.
- Heidi and Spencer.
- John and Kate.
- Snooki and the situation.
- Serious? No.
- That's reality TV...
- Khloe and Lamar.
Yes! Yes!
If I couldn't get them
to listen to me,
what made me think
I could get the world to?
- Well, um...
- Okay, I think we're good.
Poor mom. She spent her entire
life trying to be Betty Crocker.
And became Betty Ford.
Antidepressants.
Anti nausea. Antihistamine.
Anti-anxiety.
Acid reflux. Estrogen.
Osteoporosis. Tendonitis.
Wrap 'em up.
Hi there.
I'll just pop these in the computer
and you can be on your way.
- Who are you? Where's Chuck?
- Chuck retired.
I'm April Adams.
I took over for him.
I'm new in town.
I'm from the bay area.
I will be here Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday.
I'm sure your life is just
wonderful, but clearly mine is not.
So could you
hurry this up for me please?
How far along are you?
Six months.
It's a boy.
Ooh. Good luck with that.
I remember those days,
excitement, joy.
Endless cravings
for pickles and peanut butter.
I'm sure you and your
husband are just thrilled.
- Fiancé.
- Oh, how liberal.
Good thing shotgun weddings
aren't part of those gun laws
you people voted for, huh?
I'm done here, Mrs. Phillips.
- Ms.
- They'll be ready in an hour.
Fresh from the oven.
Thank you.
I brought you the latest edition
of the clover high chronicle.
My article is called
"small town sex scandal."
Do you know my grandson?
I think so.
I miss him.
He never comes
to visit me anymore.
He used to write me stories.
I remember the first
story he ever wrote me.
"Once upon a time
there was a boy."
I remember.
I told him it could use
a little development.
So the next day,
he brought me another story.
"Once upon a time,
there was a boy who...
Who wanted to fly."
I'm worried
about my grandson though.
He's changed over the years.
He used to be so happy and...
Now he walks around
with so much negative energy.
Sometimes...
Someone's personal rain cloud
can be deadly.
Hey.
Where have you been?
Munich.
Oh.
Some people get to come home
to wonderful
fiancés and sonograms.
And I get a...
Smart-ass kid I never
even wanted in the first place.
I wasn't wanted, huh?
Never have a kid to save a marriage.
It does not work.
I could've been a pharmacist.
But I settled for settling down
because I thought
that's what I wanted.
Because that's what he wanted.
It's never too late
to change your life, mother.
Oh, it was too late years ago.
You're lucky, Carson.
You're young and naive and,
and all those dreams you have
about getting out of this town
and becoming something
still seem reachable.
You should hold onto that
as long as you can.
Goodnight, mother.
Her last name was Phillips.
You have any hidden, crazy
sisters I should know about?
Um, not that I'm aware of.
I mean, my father
was in the Navy, so...
Good. You had me worried.
I'm surprised your aura
didn't set off the smoke alarm.
She sure set you off.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Just people like that
make me question the human race.
It makes me wonder
if we're doing the right thing
by bringing another one
into the world.
Oh, hey.
We're doing the right thing.
And that lunatic has nothing to do
with us, our life, or our child.
Okay? Remember that.
Okay?
Hey, remember,
we have that meeting
with the attorney tomorrow.
And the neighbor across the
street with the wondering eye
- wants to have a barbecue.
- Oh, yeah.
Hi.
You've reached Neal Phillips
with PR real estate.
Please leave a brief message
and I'll get right back to you.
Child... Support... Late!
Is that brief enough
for you, asshole?
We print tomorrow
and none of you
have written anything.
Oh, but I did collate
these kitten pictures.
Okay. I mean, is this how
it's gonna be all year?
I mean, do any of you
actually want to be here?
I really want to be here.
All right, well,
it looks like
I will be here all night
doing what
you all should've done.
Again.
Would you cut
the soliloquy short?
This doesn't matter.
No one reads
the chronicle anyway.
Hey, the art class uses it
to papier-mâché things.
Carson.
Why do you care so much?
Just don't, okay?
Uh, you're an animal.
No, you are.
- Mm-hmm.
- No, you are.
Okay, I am.
Mm-hmm, I told you.
- Ahem!
- Get off me!
Well, gentlemen.
I...Am... Shocked.
Amused. But shocked.
Go ahead. Tell the whole world.
We don't care.
God, Scott. Please don't tell anybody.
My parents can't find out.
Listen, Cagney, Lacey.
I know what it's like
to be an outcast.
I bet.
I wouldn't wish the struggles
of an outed outcast to anyone.
So I won't tell.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Fantastic.
But...
Since I will be keeping
my mouth shut about your
you know, inabilities,
you know, not to,
perhaps you could
return a favor.
- How much do you want?
- Oh, no.
Have some self respect. No!
I don't want you to
shit a dime for me, Nicholas.
But you know what the clover
high chronicle could use?
A finance section.
And a weekly update from
the performing arts department.
You want us to write for
you hid-e-odous school paper?
- For how long?
- No.
Until we graduate
and go our separate ways.
That's it. No. I'd rather you
just let the whole school know.
- Shut up, Scott.
- Don't talk to me like that.
Just because he's here, you're
gonna talk to me like that?
- We'll do it.
- Gentlemen,
sharpen your pencils.
I'd like to thank you both
for coming today.
Um, there's no
delicate way to put this,
so I'm just going to say it.
Neal, you cannot marry April
because you are still married.
How come I'm the only
one laughing here?
Um, how?
Your wife never signed
the divorce papers.
This is a really
long joke, you guys.
Well, um, April.
Um...
This is a joke, right?
'Cause you would've
told me if you had an ex-wife
or so much as a cocker spaniel
- before we had...
- Just... just a son.
His name is Carson Phillips.
Seventeen years old.
A son?
Okay, I've gotta go.
April...
don't you dare
say anything to me.
Bob.
Can anyone tell me which
president's administration
- was referred to as Camelot?
- Clinton?
No. That was came-a-lot.
Heh, heh, heh, heh.
Hey, Sheryl. It's Neal.
Listen, we need to talk.
It's really important.
So I'm gonna
come over there this afternoon
and I'm not leaving until we do.
See you soon.
Thanks.
Thanks.
You heard back from
- Northwestern?
- Oh, my God!
You scared the crap out of me!
It's a juice cup.
Um, yes, I did.
That is a fancy schmancy school
you're looking at up there.
- And?
- Well, I didn't find out
if you'd been
accepted or denied,
but the person I talked to
said that high school newspapers
and clubs just
aren't cutting it anymore.
So, if you want to impress them,
you're gonna have to submit
- something else.
- Like what?
Um... You know what?
I actually wrote this down.
Somewhere I made a list.
Here we go.
You could submit a novel,
a book of poems...
I can't read
my handwriting down there.
I'm not a novelist and I'm not a poet.
I'm a journalist.
I know. You're a journalist.
Um, what about
a literary magazine?
- A literary magazine?
- It's not as common
as a high school newspaper,
and you know, a magazine
filled with your work
and the work of other students,
well, I think it would show them
that you can inspire others to write
while writing yourself.
Okay, I'll do it. How?
I don't know how to do
a literary magazine.
But get permission
from the principal first,
because he can be
such an asshole. Um...
Okay. All right. Um...
Thank you.
Okay.
Hi, Sheryl.
- Neal.
- Yeah.
Your screen's still broken.
- Can I come in?
- Uh, well, just for a minute
'cause I'm
expecting company so...
Yeah. Okay, sure.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
Oh. It's pink now.
Yeah.
Hmm.
Can I get you a beer?
Um, let's see.
Well, no. No, I think I'm good.
Thanks.
Hi. You look...
- You look good, Sheryl.
- Oh.
- No, come on.
- Oh, thanks.
I'd say the same about you
but then we'd both be liars.
Yeah. The last time I saw
you, you were screaming
profanities at me
in the middle of the street.
- So this is a step up.
- I think you are exaggerating
- just a little bit.
- No, no.
- Yeah.
- But I deserved it.
So why are you here, Neal?
Did you come to gloat about
your new happy life?
Uh, no. I'm here because um...
You never signed
the divorce papers.
Oh, jeez. I thought I
mailed those back in.
- Yeah, no.
- Oh, maybe I uh,
ripped them up
into little pieces
and threw 'em
into the fireplace.
I forget.
I have to talk to you!
I know you can see me!
I'm tired.
What do you need, Mr. Phillips?
I already told you I can't force
the English teachers to pass out
the chronicle or any
other biased publication.
I have absolutely have no inquiries
or requests about the chronicle.
Uh, God!
I...
I want to start
a school literary magazine.
Why... why are you laughing?
Okay, fine.
You can start your
literary magazine or you know,
you can start a hunting
magazine for all I care,
but...
You're gonna have to find
your own funding because...
The school is broke.
I'd also like to announce it
at the assembly this week.
It'll take three seconds.
Fine. If for nothing else
than my own amusement.
Great. Great. Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey! Break it up!
Not on my campus!
There's a motel 6
down the street!
I got ya! I got ya! I got ya!
Yep, that's it.
Yep, it's just papers.
Signature
doesn't change anything.
Okay. Yeah, thanks, Sheryl.
For what's it's worth,
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I'm not the man
you wanted me to be.
- Yeah. Me, too.
- Yeah. Me, too.
Okay.
Oh, please. Please, please.
Okay. I'll see ya.
Okay. I'll see ya.
There's so much stress
in my life.
It's a miracle I'm able to
function as well as I do.
But does anybody care?
Does anybody...
Does my son see how much I
struggle every single day?
- Well, I don't envy you.
- Thank you, Dr. Wheeler.
You're the only person
who understands my situation.
He's becoming more and more
like his father every day.
He's rude, sarcastic.
He makes a joke at my
expense whenever he can.
And all he talks about
is leaving for college one day.
Everybody abandons me
or plans to abandon me.
If I had a goldfish...
He would probably
abandon you as well.
- It would abandon me.
- But you don't have a goldfish.
No, I don't, thank God.
Well, the thing
about goldfish is
they're in that bowl,
they can't get out.
It would find a way.
That's pretty extreme thinking.
- Um, let me ask you this.
- Yes.
- Is he on antidepressants?
- No.
- Do you think he needs them?
- Do I think he needs them?
Well, in all honesty,
I think all teenagers need them
whether they're
depressed or not.
You know, teenagers
are so full of hormones.
They don't know
what the hell they want.
All they're thinking about is rubbing
against a pillow or a cushion
or another teenager.
You know, so.
I can't believe how you're
making me feel so much better.
And I think if he had
something to ground him,
uh, he wouldn't be
so eager to fly away.
You need to be
on antidepressants.
No way.
You're medicated enough
for the both of us.
Aren't you depressed?
Currently, while having
this conversation? Yeah.
Everyone gets depressed.
It's an emotion.
People turn to pills.
Before they turn
to their problems these days.
Well, sometimes
it's the only solution.
You're depressing me right now.
Are you saying that
I'm gonna take a pill
and then you're gonna disappear?
That was uncalled for.
And so are
most prescription drugs.
We are living in
a medicated society.
We start drugging kids with
A.D.D., which they all have,
and then it
doesn't stop till death.
You were on add medication
as a kid, and you turned out
somewhat decent.
No, I wasn't.
I hid it in your food.
I thought I was just really
calm and mature for my age.
Nope, you were drugged.
When your father and I
started our divorce,
you started asking so many
questions, we found it easier
to roofie you than answer you.
Well, it isn't dinner
unless some form of
my childhood foundation
is shattered.
- I need money.
- I give you an allowance.
I need more money. $300.
I want to start
a literary magazine at school,
and I need money to print
the first 100 copies or so.
No.
Why not?
I know you're rolling in it.
Grandpa died
and left us everything.
Wrong. He left me everything.
You, his car.
- What about my college fund?
- Key word, college.
Okay. If I start
taking antidepressants,
will you give me the money
to start my literary magazine?
Deal.
Pass me the salt.
Hello,
future farmers and inmates.
I'm Carson Phillips from
the clover high chronicle
here with some
very exciting news.
This year,
for the first time ever,
clover high will release its
first literary magazine.
Whoo! Awesome!
Now, I know most of you
can't read let alone write,
but for all
the secret writers out there,
please submit any original work
to the box outside the journalism
classroom and it will be published.
Poems. Short stories.
Hit lists.
Anything.
Okay. Thank you.
God bless.
Whoo! Carson!
Okay, assembly dismissed.
Return to your homerooms.
And hey! Say hello to someone
you don't know today.
I am so excited
for homecoming tonight.
Our float is gonna be flawless.
The crowd is gonna love it.
Whoo!
Oh... No.
Shiterary magazine.
God.
Typical. I mean,
I can't even run a school newspaper.
I don't know why
I thought I could start
a literary magazine.
- Oh...
- Personal space, Malerie.
Okay.
Just don't be
too hard on yourself.
If you can get Nicholas Forbes
and Scott Thomas
to join the chronicle,
then I think
you can do anything.
I'm blackmailing them.
I caught them playing Lewis and
Clark in the boy's bathroom.
- Don't ask.
- There seems to be
a lot of that
going on right now.
I caught Claire Mathews
and coach Colin bonking...
Each other...
In the boy's locker room.
I just go in there
to think sometimes.
Coach Colin Walker?
I thought she was
dating Justin Walker.
Oh, that must be awkward.
Too bad they aren't writers.
If they had work
in the magazine,
then everybody would want to have
work in the literary magazine.
It would sell out for sure.
You know, it just
makes you think though.
Everybody
has something to hide...
Even Claire Mathews.
Ha!
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I travel lightly today.
Not a problem, Mrs. Phillips.
Ms. Ms. Ms.
What?
Why are you looking at me
like I just told you
I used to be a man?
This is for Carson Phillips?
Yeah, that's my son.
Why does he need
antidepressants?
I don't think that's
any of your business, April.
- Forgive me, miss Phillips...
- You know what, call me Sheryl.
Just simple Sheryl.
I think I may be
engaged to your ex-husband.
Neal Phillips?
Wait! Miss Phillips?
Sheryl?!
Hi.
Hi.
How was work?
Not good.
I'm sorry, but there's
only so many times
I can say I'm sorry.
But I want you to realize
that all of that was a really
dark period for me.
Um, so...
Can you really blame me
for not wanting to
carry it with me?
Can you blame me
for wanting to forget about it?
I want to meet him.
Your son, I want to meet him.
Yeah.
We tried selling some ad
space to local businesses
but I had no takers.
Well, you look like shit.
Why couldn't I have
worn something like that?
Okay. I don't know
what you're wearing,
but I have some bad news.
The truck pulling
the cheer float's
engine just died,
- so they're taking yours.
- Excuse me?
Oh, um, my apologies.
But you know,
homecoming's nothing
without the cheer float.
Okay, then go take
the athletes float away.
I mean, they pride themselves
running around like mules anyway.
My decision's final.
Okay.
Final.
Well, at least
we had fun making it.
No. They're gonna
see this float if it kills me.
Nice costume.
Nice life.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Whoo!
Yeah!
- You're the man!
- Screw you!
- Are you drunk?
- Wasted.
# No matter what... #
My apologies, but, you know,
homecoming's nothing
without the cheer float.
No one reads
the "chronicle" anyway.
He's only here because he's the
editor of that stupid paper.
# No matter what... #
Hello?
Malerie? It's Carson.
- Who?
- Carson Phillips.
Oh, yeah, I knew.
Operation clovergate's
in effect.
So many people to blackmail,
so little time.
But how're we gonna
blackmail all of them?
Humph.
I don't know.
I got dirt on most of them.
So I'm not sure.
But then again,
Columbus wasn't sure if
north America was there.
But it didn't stop him
from sailing to it.
And once he was there,
- you know what he did?
- What?
He enslaved every single
Indian around him.
Oh, you little Indians,
look out.
Yeah.
Some will be
much easier than others.
N-n-no.
# when the sky #
# opens #
# and the sound
comes out of it now #
# it's like a breath of air
it's like a splash of water #
# it's like a slap #
# on the hand... #
You're "badboy2012"?
I can't even
look at you anymore.
Not that it was easy before.
It's a nice day.
Hey, Siegfried. Here you go.
Hey, Roy, enjoy.
Ahem!
What's this?
Come on. You know what that is.
You left it in
the journalism classroom.
Um, did you guys want some?
If we were responsible students
we would go right now
to the school authorities.
Listen,
I'll write the movie review,
I promise you. Huh?
It's too late for that.
What a rush.
# No matter what #
# I say #
Can I help you?
I was uh, just googling
some Satan worshiping cults,
you know, a hobby of mine, and
I came across these.
Check these out, right?
Isn't that you, I believe,
with a whip in your mouth?
Yes, yes, here you're
riding some guys in this one.
Yes, that's great. And this one.
This one's my favorite.
Why are you showing me these?
Oh, I just want
to protect you, Vicki.
I mean, I'd hate it if these were
accidentally emailed to your mom.
Does she still teach
Sunday school
at Ryder Baptist church?
And when I say teamwork,
what's the first thing
that comes to mind?
Shut up!
Move your books.
Move your books!
# Two, four, six, eight #
# heard you like to fornicate #
Carson!
I want you to be
there at that time.
I also want to recommend
not sleeping with students...
Strongly recommend it.
Strongly recommend it.
I could get fired for this,
and I need that dental plan.
It's normal to be with older
women in your culture, right?
I have no idea what you are
saying, but you are so hot.
And young and tannish
and imported.
Oh, God. I feel like I'm
in eat, pray, love.
- Was that dirty talk?
- Si.
Oh, I love dirty talk.
Oh, you're so
"spanelicious!" I love it!
Ms. Hastings?
Coming.
- Hola?
- What's up, man?
Hey, what's happening, bro?
Nah, nothing. I was just
feeling up the receptionist.
Yeah, dude, no,
the receptionist.
It's insane. I'm one away
from beating my record.
I literally put the "dick"
in valedictorian.
It's...
I'll call you back.
So, Emilio...
How long have you been
a fornicating exchange student?
And I would
tone down the Telemundo.
- Malerie here is in Spanish 4.
- Si.
I'm also fluent in
Celtic and Elvish.
Take that light in your face.
All right, look.
I'm not from
El Salvador obviously.
I'm from San Diego.
Sea world, I knew it.
I knew he smelt
very faintly of dolphin.
- No, I don't.
- What else? Tell us the truth!
Speak.
The only Spanish I know
is from level one,
Rosetta Stone, which I stole.
I've been saying the same 10
phrases over and over again
and no one seems to notice.
Please don't
tell my host family.
- Dude, they'd have me arrested.
- Why would you do this?
Are you kidding?
I get food, housing...
And girls.
Dude, girls like nothing more
than a guy that speaks Spanish.
That just little...
Oh, my God.
It all makes sense now.
Continue.
Dude, you can't blame me.
Yeah, yeah, I can.
I can blame you
muchas gracias, senorita.
This is for you.
- Si, "se paedophile."
- And just remember,
we have this all on film.
Well, hello, everyone.
And welcome
to the journalism classroom.
- You fascist.
- Okay, enough with the names,
all right? Okay, look.
I'll make this short and sweet.
You're all here
because I've got dirt on you.
Okay, well,
I know why I'm here.
Pretty sure
I know why Dwayne's here.
Why are the rest of you here?
That's for me to know
and the rest of you
to never know
if all goes as planned.
This is bullshit. Not to mention illegal.
Do you know how many
lawyers my family has?
- Seven.
- All right, listen.
If any of you
would like to share
the information I have on you,
please feel free to do so
and then leave the room.
Didn't think so.
I'm late for
hello Dolly rehearsal
- so what do you want from us?
- As you all know,
I am starting
a school literary magazine.
You want us
to buy your magazine?
You Claire, no.
I would never expect you
to recognize an intelligent
publication let alone purchase one.
But your friends
and families, yes. Why?
'Cause you're all
gonna be in it.
I want a literary submission
from each of you.
So that's what
this is all about?
This is ridiculous.
I'm not even a student here.
It's because
I want more from you.
And from you.
I want a submission from each
football player and cheerleader.
What?
Oh, you can't make me,
my cheer team, or anyone else
do anything, okay?
See, there is a reason
why you and precious
in the corner over there
are the only members
of your club. Okay?
And it's because everybody hates you.
Even if you spread
whatever information you
have on us around the school,
no one is going
to believe you, got it?
- I will totally believe him.
- You don't count.
Oh, we don't count?
Thank you very much.
They will believe, 'cause we will
spread that shit like nutella.
All right, for years
I have been poked and stabbed
with your bitch fork.
You have beaten me down
to the bottom
of the high school food chain
with the shitty end of the stick
for far too long.
You don't think
they're gonna believe me?
I will make them believe me!
You don't think
they've just been waiting for
an excuse to turn against you?
I mean, sure they all hate
me, but that's because
I'm the only person in town with
an IQ larger than my shoe size
and I don't hesitate
to remind people that!
So go ahead and play all
the mind games you want.
I'm not accepting that
invitation to intimidation
any longer, all right?!
I've got a whole hell of a lot
to gain and nothing to lose
and this time
none of you are stopping me!
Do you need some examples?!
Here are some examples,
all right,
poetry, short stories, essays,
scripts, novels, anything!
As long as it's in your words,
in my hands asap! You got it?!
Write about
how much you hate me.
Write in detail about how much
you want to kill me, okay?!
Now get the hell out of
my classroom!
Excuse me.
I'm worried most of you
have taken one too many
tackles to the head.
We can't beat a team
unless we outthink a team.
So...
To prove you are
all capable of doing that,
I want you all
to submit something
to the school
literary magazine.
Uh, what the...
don't question me,
hit the showers now!
I like the color green.
When I see green,
I think of trees, plants
and grass.
When I think of grass,
I think of football...
- Brilliant.
- We can't cheer
if we're not cultured.
I just want everyone
to write something
for the literary magazine,
okay?
Now let's go do
a frickin' pyramid.
I love cheerleading.
But the worst thing about
being on top of the pyramid is
you can get really hurt
if you fall.
It was a world of
vampires and demons
where innocence was rare
and so were the living.
Why do people live
2d lives in a 3d world
when they can live
4d lives all the time?
Yeah.
I have always known that
I was destined for fame.
The image of my name in
lights isn't just a dream,
it's a premonition.
Roses are red,
violets are blue,
no amount of money
could keep me away from you.
There was
once a little princess
with several responsibilities.
Her parents,
the king and queen,
put way too much
pressure on her
since they had troubles
managing the kingdom.
Malerie writing
part 38.
Action.
Call me...
Isabella.
It's genius.
It was anything like
I'd ever experienced.
For the first time in my life,
I was winning.
For the first time,
everything seemed reachable.
It's like Christmas.
So I'm blackmailing
the entire school
to better my chances
of getting into the university
of my dreams,
and it's exhilarating.
I mean,
who'd of thought that one of
my biggest accomplishments
would be criminal?
- Get out.
- Oh, no,
not today, grandma.
Please don't.
- Not today.
- Get out.
Get out. I do not know you!
All right, okay, I'm leaving.
So we still need a venue
for prom, any ideas?
I was thinking quail gardens.
What about
motel 6 up the highway?
I mean, everyone heads up there
after prom anyway, right?
Any objections
to quail gardens?
No objections.
Isn't quail gardens
like right in the middle
of the country?
And prom is usually
in the beginning of summer
so everyone's gonna be
eaten alive by bugs.
I think the uh, the clover
dining hall would be cheaper
- and smarter.
- Okay,
clover dining hall it is.
- Awesome, moving on.
- We need a theme.
How 'bout a fairy tale theme?
We could do
an easy Cinderella
setting for photos.
Oh, my God. I love Rapunzel.
Yeah, I'm not sure
all the students
would appreciate
um, that theme.
Like the male ones.
Why don't you guys do
like a, uh, era theme,
like the roaring '20s
or something?
'20s is fine.
Super.
Okay. Why are you guys, uh,
letting me make
all the decisions?
It was a lot more fun
when I got to argue with you.
Are you gonna make us
write more if we do?
- Anything for me?
- No,
just bills and ads
and bills, bills, bills.
Let me see.
Magazines...
Uh, let me know
if you find anything.
- Yep.
- Thank you.
Howdy.
Here is my entry
for the magazine.
Uh, great.
Is it about contraception?
You know what?
It must be really nice
to have plans
to journey out into the world,
but some of us
don't have that capability.
Some of us are stuck here
and have to make the most of it,
so excuse me for wanting to have
a little fun my senior year.
It could be
the last chance that I get.
And why are you incapable?
Why are you stuck here?
Second grade
Mrs. McCoy's classroom.
I doubt you remember
this, but I do.
We went around the room and
we all said what we wanted to be
when we grew up. I said that I wanted
to be a Nobel peace prize winner
- and you said...
- I wanted to be a ballerina.
What stopped you?
- They all laughed at me.
- But I didn't laugh at you.
In what grade do we
stop believing in ourselves?
Well, what grade do we
just stop believing period?
I mean, someone has to be
a Nobel peace prize winner.
Someone has to be a ballerina.
Why not us?
Now I can't be
the only one that gets that.
You know,
when I'm here at school,
I just turn my phone off
so that I don't hear it
not ringing.
Who is it?
It's... My dad.
Hello?
Hey, Carson.
I didn't mean to call you after school.
I'm sure you're busy
with your homework and so forth
but I got some really good news
I wanna tell you. Yeah, I'm getting married.
Her name's April.
We're expecting a baby and you're
gonna have a baby brother.
You gotta be shitting me.
So anyway, she wants to meet you.
Is there any chance
you could make it
over for dinner sometime soon?
I... I'd have to think about it.
Please do. In fact,
I'd really appreciate it.
Hope to see you soon. 'Kay?
- 'Kay.
- 'Kay, bye.
What happened?
Uh, um...
Apparently,
my dad's getting married.
Congratulations.
I guess.
Where're you going?
Ah...
I'm gonna go
have dinner with dad.
- Why?
- Um...
Apparently,
he's getting married.
Good for him.
He wants me
to go meet his fiancé so...
Have fun.
Be home at a decent hour and,
and all that parenting shit.
Bye, mom.
Love you.
Your dad tells me
you're quite popular at school.
No.
I'm active,
but I'm, I'm not popular.
Well, he's part of
the newspaper club.
Actually, I'm president
of the writers' club.
Editor of the school newspaper,
and I recently just started
a literary magazine.
Check you out.
You must get really good grades.
Yeah, he does pretty well.
I have a 4.3.
I would have a 4.5,
but I tend to argue with the
teachers and their lesson plans so.
Well, do you play sports?
I'm just...
I mean...
God knows I tried.
We'd always go down
- to the park...
- Did we?
Throw the ball around,
but he didn't show any interest.
So I quickly realized that
I didn't get that major leaguer
I was hoping for.
He kind of threw like a girl.
- Dad, we, we never did that.
- Well, sure we did.
You just don't remember.
I don't think you remember.
No, I would remember
something like that.
He's actually exaggerating.
He's got a very sort of
creative imagination.
I think that's what makes him
- such a good writer.
- Who are you pretending to be?
Like, what are you doing?
You left what,
like five years ago when I've
seen you twice since then?
You're young,
maybe you don't understand.
You're right, I don't understand.
I don't understand
how you could just abandon your
old family and then act like
everything is okay
in front of the new one.
- Carson, your mom's unstable.
- Yeah, I know.
- And you left me with her.
- Carson...
Yeah, you know, I can't...
Thank you, April.
Thank you for dinner.
It was lovely meeting you,
but I have to go.
Carson, I can only say sorry
a number of times, but...
Well, he's his mother's son.
I've called you
in here today to announce
a new district rule myself
and the rest of the principal
board feel very strongly about.
So starting next semester,
all book covers,
backpacks and clothing
displaying logos and writing
are strictly forbidden.
So as council members,
it's very important
that you honor this rule
and provide leadership
- by following it.
- Okay, agreed,
I hate some of the obnoxious
and degrading things
that I read everyday,
and if I see one more person
wearing one of those shirts
that says, "I do my own stunts,"
I'm gonna physically rip off
my face and throw it at them.
But I mean, how are we
supposed to learn and grow
when you keep taking away our basic
freedoms of self expression?
Tell you what, buddy,
why don't you just let us
worry about student suppression?
- How's that?
- Yeah, you're right.
You people must know
what you're doing since
more students are more
depressed, more stressed
and dropping out now
more than ever before
so you're doing a real great
job with the decisions.
- You're out of line.
- You're on a power trip.
How does banning logos
do anything except help your own
- conservative agendas?
- This discussion is over, okay?
You will follow the new rules.
And because of
your disrespectful attitude,
I hereby revoke all student
off-campus privileges
for the rest of the year.
Your peers can thank you,
little man.
Let's go, guys.
Aah! You can't punish
the whole school
for one student's big mouth!
I can't believe
you all just sat there!
Oh, I can't believe you're still
putting the blame on us.
Thanks to you, we have to
have prom in the cafeteria.
We'll be spending a lot of time there since
we can't go off campus to eat anymore.
If you write an apology letter,
maybe they'd reconsider.
He should apologize
to the whole school.
Hm-hmm, what about
next week at assembly?
Oh, Carson, you always thought
you were so much better than us
because we all
couldn't stand you,
but get ready for pure hatred
coming your way because as soon as
the rest of the school
finds out about this
and they tell their parents,
the entire town will actually
- hate you!
- Enough, all right?!
I didn't just
stand up for myself in there,
I was standing up
for all of you!
The minute you guys
walked into this campus,
you were labeled
as high school royalty,
and you'd rather maintain
that label than heaven forbid
stand up for yourselves!
But high school ends,
and for your sakes,
I hope guys aren't
the walking clichés
everyone thinks you are!
'Cause life is gonna
walk all over you and it's
gonna bite you in the ass!
We are not clichés.
I tried avoiding you
as long as I could,
but this is
the only pharmacy in town,
and I'm starting to go through withdrawal.
So I need my refills.
I figured as much.
Wow. I know what
you must think of me.
Pathetic divorcee
who turned herself into this.
Well, this isn't
the life you want.
I gave him my life...
Only to be tossed aside
when he decided
it wasn't enough.
This was never a part of my
picket fence fantasy.
You and I aren't so different.
I had a kid to save a marriage,
and you're having one
to ensure one.
So you shouldn't be
so quick to judge.
Especially you.
'Cause I was you...
And now I'm this.
Sometimes I just don't get it.
Life.
I mean, why do
some of us have to work
so hard for things
we believe in
and others don't?
I mean, why do
some of us care so much?
I mean, why are some of us
selfish by nature and...
Some of us
are selfish to survive?
Dear, I'm making this
for my grandson.
Wh-what is it?
A scarf blanket.
I wanted to be heard so bad
that I never
thought about listening.
But what I regretted the most
was that I lived every day
waiting for my life to begin.
What's this?
It's a magazine.
Dick.
The higher your cloud,
the further your rain falls.
It's full of literary stuff.
Three dollars.
I soon learned
that when it rains
it pours.
All right.
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?
They won't let you reapply.
You were accepted,
but you never confirmed.
So you were denied.
No, it must've gotten lost
in the mail. I...
I checked every day.
Please, you... you...
you have to tell them that.
I'm afraid I can't do anymore for you.
But you can always go
- to your second choice school.
- There was no second choice.
Oh. Well, you can
apply again in two years
after you complete
your requirements.
Clover community college
is still accepting applications.
Would you like to fill
out an application?
Carson...
Would you like
to fill out an application?
You know,
I've never seen the ocean.
Hi, you've reached Carson.
Leave a message, mom.
Uh, Carson, grandma fell,
and you gotta get...
Get over here
as soon as you can.
You can expect some
light showers
and a possible thunderstorm
by the end of the week.
You can expect clear skies afterwards
though until next Tuesday.
Where were you?
Fine, don't tell me.
But if you were at your
father's, I'd be fine with it.
- How is she?
- She's fine.
Bruised her hip
but nothing's broken.
I'm gonna get some coffee,
do you want something?
No.
- What happened to me?
- You fell and hurt yourself.
- You remind me of my grandson.
- I do?
- Why is that?
- You're sad looking.
What's going on?
They're giving her a bath.
What's your problem?
I got into Northwestern
but I never got a letter.
So...
I have to wait
two years to reapply.
I threw your letter away.
- What?!
- I'm sorry.
How could you
throw my letter away?!
- I wanted to protect you.
- Protect me?!
I didn't want you
to get hurt like I did.
All your talk about growing up
and becoming a writer and all...
All these delusions you
have won't happen.
Dreams don't come true, Carson.
Take it from me,
I am living proof.
The world is a very cruel place.
You would've left,
been eaten alive,
come back utterly destroyed,
and I didn't want that.
I wanted better for you.
I can't believe this.
This is so unfair.
Life is unfair,
you know, it is.
And the sooner you realize that,
the faster you grow up.
And the faster you grow up,
the sooner you'll see
the world
for what it really is.
You know, thank you.
Thank you for being
the perfect example
of something
that I refuse to become!
# Bad day

# force a smile... #

Carson, I need to talk to you.
I need to apologize.
I need to apologize.
What are we gonna do
with all of these?
I'm donating them to my grandmother's home.
They're sending someone
after school to come and pick
'em up and pass 'em out.
At least they'll be read.
Or chewed.
I'm so sorry
things didn't work out
the way that
you wanted them to.
Me, too.
Looks like I'll be seeing you
around clover community college.
Maybe we'll be adventurous
and start
a literary magazine there.
Malerie,
why do you film everything?
I mean, I'm sure
you don't want to remember...
Everything.
What isn't worth remembering?
With good memories
come bad memories,
and I've got a lot of both.
At least this way I can fast
forward through all the bad stuff.
A counselor once told me
that it doesn't matter
if you're stuck in the past
or if you
try to forget the past.
What matters is
what you do in the present.
That's why I just try to soak
it up as much as possible.
I think you just found
something to write about.
I gotta go.
If I'm late for the bus,
the driver said
he'd make me ride in the trunk.
It is not fun.
Carson.
Are we...
Friends?
I think we're best friends,
Malerie.
Cool.
Cool.
He used to be such a happy boy.
He used to write me stories.
I remember the first story
he ever wrote me.
"Once upon a time
there was a boy."
Then it became,
"once upon a time
there was a boy
who wanted to fly."
And it just got
better and better over time.
Now I never did find out
whether the boy got to fly.
And then
it suddenly came to me.
I had one more story to add.
I had been so busy
dwelling in my own self-pity
I had forgotten
what I actually accomplished.
I successfully
published a literary magazine
filled with the thoughts,
concerns,
hopes and imaginations
of my jaded high school peers.
For the first time in my life,
I was truly happy.
Carson, where are you?
School ended three hours ago.
What are you, at your father's?
Are you two like
best friends now or something?
Just call me back.
I don't know
what's more pathetic,
the fact that I was
actually struck by lightning
or that it took three days
for anyone to find my body.
Whoa.
It's Carson Phillips,
he's dead.
What?!
Are you Sheryl Phillips?
Hi, you've reached Carson.
Leave a message, mom.
Carson?
I need you to come home right now!
This isn't funny.
Hi, you've reached Carson.
Leave a message, mom.
Ahh! Carson!
There are cops outside
that say you're dead!
I need you to co...
I need you to come home!
I need to talk to you!
I need you
to come home right now!
Hi, you've reached Carson.
Leave a message, mom.
Please answer your phone.
Answer your phone.
I need to know you're okay.
I need to know you're okay.
Hi, you've reached Carson.
Leave a message, mom.
Hi, you've reached Carson.
Leave a message, mom.
A few days ago
right here where I'm standing,
clover high school senior
Carson Phillips lost his life
when he was
struck my lightning.
A service
will be held this Sunday
at clover community chapel.
He will be missed.
It's amazing how popular
you become once you die.
I think I speak
for the entire faculty
when I say...
Your son was an absolute joy.
Oh, kiss my embalmed ass.
Death changes things I guess,
but even death couldn't suit
some of the impressions I left.
Absolutely not.
Your book club will not
spare a page to remind people
that Carson Phillips
was zapped in the parking lot.
Sir, those pages
are reserved for prom.
- I'm just saying one page.
- Plant a tree.
How do I begin
to describe Carson Phillips?
I never graduated,
I never went to Northwestern,
I never wrote
for "the new Yorker,"
I never won
the Nobel peace prize,
I never changed the world.
I never got out of clover.
- It's a lot like...
- Lightning.
Yeah, exactly.
These were just delusions
that occupied my time.
And thank God they did.
Okay, so we all agree,
leopard print will be our theme
for our safari prom.
And of course
it will all be faux fur.
Because a life without
meaning, without drive,
- without focus...
- On second thought,
the safari prom idea
kinda sucks.
Let's come up
with something better.
Without goals or dreams...
Isn't a life worth living.
"To grandma,
"once upon a time
there was a boy who flew."
Life comes at you fast,
it runs through your body
and tries to escape
and be expressed
in any way possible.
In a way, it's a lot like...
Lightning.
