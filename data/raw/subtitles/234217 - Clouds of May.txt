-Hi!
-Hi!
What's that Saffet?
-University exam results.
-Have you passed?
-I'll have a tea then we'll look.
-Haven't you looked at it yet?
-No I haven't.
CLOUDS OF MAY
Hello, Dad.
-What a surprise to see you.
-How are you doing?
-Come in.
-You still haven't had
the doorbell fixed.
-I haven't had time
with all this work.
-You've changed the house.
-We had quite an upheaval.
Painting and suchlike.
Muzaffer.
you're a man of
surprises.
Are you tired?
-Yes I am, dad.
You look tired as well.
Were you at the field?
-Yes, and it tired me out.
After l got back l fell asleep
reading a book.
Have you come from
Trakya route?
l waited for the boat.
The heat is killing me.
Where's Mum?
-Do they shoot the movies
with these small cameras?
-No. We use these for the
test shots.
lsn't Mum here?
There, she's coming.
Let me surprise her.
-Muzaffer, welcome home.
-Welcome to you too. How are you?
-Fine thanks. How are you?
-Fine.
I'll give the child something.
-lsn't this Uncle's son Ali?
-Mr. Ali
-Yes.
-How old are you now?
-Nine.
Which grade are you in?
-2A.
2A?
Where's your dad?
-ln Ã‡anakkale.
What's he doing?
-Working.
Does he get back sometimes?
- Put this in your pocket.
Don't forget what
l told you, will you?
-Come on. Don't be
late for school.
He looks just like my childhood.
-You're relatives.
Emin!
What was that noise?
l didn't hear anything.
-l did.
The blanket has turned
round again.
l lay it straight,
it turns again.
-You can't tell the width and
length of your blankets.
lt confuses me as well.
-To bribe or not to bribe.
That's the problem.
-Emin, is it worth spending
money on that?
-Fuck it. l will, even if
it costs 50 million.
I'm itching all over.
lt woke me up from my sleep.
ls it hereditary or what?
-You feed on the wrong
food.
Am l itching?
-You're not.
But mine
must be hereditary.
My mother had it too.
However much it costs,
I don't care.
-l will try.
-Emin, you are just obstinate.
-Who's being obstinate?
-You waste your money.
The land isn't worth it either.
-Pay the lawyer, pay this,
pay that. Don't be silly.
-You have to do
things properly.
Tomorrow I have to go to
the field again to cut the hay.
-What use is cutting the hay?
-lt has to look
as if we're farming there.
The government won't let
you have the place.
Of course I'm going to mess
around.
l know all the laws.
I have kept all proofs.
I've looked after that
place for fifty years.
I'll fight them to
the bitter end
with God's help.
What kind of film is he
going to shoot?
-Muzaffer.
-I don't know.
-Something like a documentary?
lt won't make money.
-That's for sure.
He never does work
that brings money.
What's this?
ls the disputed area up to
these poplar trees?
Yes, it's from this
road to the poplars.
This is the area.
Look at these trees,
without them this field
would be worth nothing.
The government won't
let you have them.
They won't let you.
lt belongs to them.
Why should they let you?
You're always on the state's side.
-What?
You're always
on the state's side.
Are you going to chop wood?
-I'm just going to chop these.
Let me help you.
-It's all right.
-Stop. Wait.
Give it here.
-I'll do it, leave it.
Not like that, you should
chop diagonally.
With these boots you don't have
to worry about rain or mud.
You can go anywhere
in bad weather...
-with an umbrella.
Come Dad, sit down.
-Are you always going to sit
in the shade like this?
-Are you shooting a film?
Are films shot with
a small camera like this?
-No dad, with bigger ones.
-With bigger ones?
Look at these trees. The government
encourages people to fell them.
You cut them down,
they give you the title deed.
lf you don't cut them they
come and get you.
ls that fair?
-No.
When did you say
they would come?
They say about three months.
-There's still a lot of time.
Of course not. I've been waiting
for them for twenty years,
what is three months?
-That's true.
They will come
in 3-4 months.
When they come
l absolutely must be here.
lf I am not, they'll mark
the trees and go...
then you can't
claim anythhing.
They don't know
what's at stake here.
The land survey comes
with a judge,
an agriculturist, a forester.
They look where the forest is...
and where the field is. Where's
the river, where's the road.
They have a can of red
paint for marking the trees.
This is a lot of land,
they won't give it to you.
They don't care if there are any
forrests or not. ls there a law...
in Turkey saying
you can't grow trees?
These were planted in 1 926.
-You can't prove it.?
They can come and
check the age.
But the other trees around
are the same age as well.
Take a look at the trees.
There are no oaks like this one.
It's all scrub.
-There's not much difference really.
Of course there is. These
give acorns, those don't.
lt took 20 years for them
to produce acorns.
How will you prove your point?
Look, I've got really
good evidence.
There's a case on this issue.
I have all the proofs.
Now l must copy them...
and hand over to the judge.
Then there is Article G.
lt says that privately...
...owned land doesn't count
as a forest up to 30 hectares.
Somebody said:
''They won't let you have it.''
Poplars, don't count as a forest.
lf you take away the poplars.
they are about 3000 m2.
Take from 8570,
we've still got 5372 m2.
5372 m2.
And then there's Article F
and Article E.
lt deals with poplars.
Article 1 69, after a certain
time having the forest land.
Anyway,
there's no forest.
I don't understand why
you're making such an effort.
What are you going to do with it
if you finally get it?
I don't intend to die
before all this is over.
l won't go anywhere before
l finish to work on my land.
lt doesn't make any difference
whether it's yours.
this place has been
mine for years anyway.
These trees were so small.
One day a forrester came
and said: Nice work but we will
take it away from you.
How can they? Do we live
in the age of tyrants?
By law they can take it.
-They can't take it by law.
Look around, there are only fields.
Everyone here cut down
the trees in their fields.
They told me to do the same. Then the
forester would have just gone away.
They cut down all the trees.
And the governor came and
gave them their title deeds.
And then they come to me
saying this is a forest.
l could have cut down
the trees away.
Then the forrester wouldn't
have said anything.
What are you afraid of?
-I'm not.
But you know
this is Turkey.
Someone will come
and say this and that.
It's not that easy.
l put my life into this.
l won't give away
my land so easy.
That's why I have to be here
when they come.
Hell, I've got no friends left.
They all went to university.
All the dumb people in my class,
got into the university and left.
I'm sure that something
fishy is going on here.
Did you enter the university
exam this year? - Of course.
The red light of the camera
is on, Muzaffer.
Never mind.
What's the result of your exam?
l failed again.
l looked for a job
and ended up...
working in the factory.
lf this film works out,
will you leave work?
Of course l will.
l think the tape is rolling.
-Never mind, it does.
l will give up my job.
Will you be able to
find me a job in Istanbul?
l guess l will.
As long as it's Istanbul
I don't mind what job it is.
lf not, you can work with
us, we'll take care of you.
Take me to Istanbul
We'll see.
l want to get out of this shit place.
Come and sit down.
No, I'm going to read a book.
Mesut loves Ataturk very much.
Can you write it down?
Let's see.
Mesut loves Ataturk very much.
Do you love Ataturk, Mesut?
-Yes.
The sentence is finished Mesut.
What do we put at the end?
-What do we put?
-A fullstop.
Yes, we put a fullstop.
Now let's see
if Mesut wrote it right.
Just a minute.
You can sit down.
Come Tuba, what is wrong here?
Has she written it correctly?
-Yes.
What did Mesut do wrong?
Who knows this sign?
Who knows this sign?
Then tell me!
-It's an apostrophe.
An applaus for Tuba.
Well done.
Ali!
Come here.
-Where have you been?
-School.
-Which grade are you in?
-2
What do they teach at school?
Nothing?
-They do.
Do they teach you about tortoises?
-No.
-Have you ever seen a tortoise?
-Yes, I have.
-Have you seen a tortoise's home?
-No, I haven't.
Let me show you one then.
Then we'll drink something.
-lsn't this our friend the donkey?
-Yes.
-Do you like donkeys?
-Yes, l do.
-Look it's answering.
l want to know why people use
donkey' as a swear word?
They're such useful animals.
What do they do for us?
-Carry loads.
They have to cary loads?
-Yes.
They are not called
donkey in vain.
The humans are more donkeylike.
-Yes.
My friend the donkey,
my friend donkey the donkey's son.
Ali look, a tortoise.
Come on.
It's escaping. Hurry.
Not bad!
Wait a minute!
Look at it.
Look how it hides its head.
Let's put it somewhere...
we can shoot it better.
How' s that? -Nice.
-lt is quite an old one.
Have you seen one before?
-Yes, I have.
Ali, come here.
Sit.
Look at me.
Smile.
A little more.
Laugh loudly.
Stop.
Now look sad.
Sulk a little.
Sulk more.
Cry.
Very good.
May be possible.
Don't yawn, are you tired?
Take your hand of your pocket.
-I've got an egg.
Who gave it to you?
-Your mother.
My mother! What are you
going to do with it?
lf l can carry it in my pocket
for 40 days without breaking,
your mother is going to convince
my dad to buy me a musical watch.
Why doesn't your dad buy you one?
-He thinks I'll break it.
But you can't carry it
for 40 days you'll break it.
How many days has it been?
-5.
30 days left.
-No.
How many days?
-35.
Good, you're good at maths.
Why don't you boil it anyway?
lt won't break if you do.
-No, l won't.
-Why?
-That would be cheating.
No it wouldn't.
You'd do better to boil it.
l won't. -What will you do with
a whistling watch?
lt doesn't whistle.
-What does it do?
Play music.
-What will you do with it?
Listen to music.
-Listen to music?
-Why don't you get something else?
-No.
Okay then.
With the heat of your hand
you'll hatch a chick out.
-No it won't.
-lt will. Don't you hear them?
-Those are birds.
-Listen. Hold it to your ear.
Those are birds.
The tortoise is fleeing!
Run! Bring it back!
I have an idea.
Hide the egg somewhere
on the way to school,
you can pick it up
on the way back.
-You can do it every day.
-No.
-Why not?
-Because.
-Why?
-Because that is cheating.
-What do you know
about cheating?
-To trick someone.
-To trick someone!
But you never
trick anyone.
Come here. No running away.
You can't leave like that.
Stay where you are.
Which is the front?
Where's your head?
Are you filming?
Ali get up. It's raining, come on.
We're going to get wet.
-Never mind. Come on run.
Catch me up.
Catch me up.
l saw Ali today.
Did you give him that egg?
Yes.
l gave it so that he
learns a bit of responsibility.
He won't be able to do it.
l know he won't.
We could have done it
without the egg.
Could it be this one?
-So you think?
Does Uncle Pire live here?
-Why do you ask?
We've come from the homicide desk.
I'm Detective Muzaffer.
And this is lnspector Saffet.
We're investigating a crime.
-ls he at home?
-He might be lying down.
-Does he live alone?
-Yes.
Okay.
ls it this door?
-Yes.
Uncle Pire.
Who is that?
Guests.
-Welcome.
-Are you ill?
-I'm a bit under the weather.
Sorry to disturb you.
-It's all right.
-Can you get up? -Okay l will.
We're outside if you can
just come for 5 minutes.
I'll come right away.
-We're sorry.
Let's move the table
and sit down.
Come Uncle Pire, come.
-Hello and welcome.
-l guess we disturbed you.
-I'm sorry.
It's all right.
-Are you ill?
-A little.
It's old age.
They say you used to do
some plays on feast days.
Yes, we used to
at one time.
We're going to shoot
a film around here.
l see. Okay, okay.
-We'll shoot a movie.
Could you do a couple
of sketches for us too?
-Those days are over,
but I'll give it a try.
-We can give you some money too.
-No need for money.
-Thanks.
-Money for what?
Money comes and goes.
Go and get the camera.
Let's do a couple of test shots.
-Right.
-Did you say something?
My wife died last month.
We took her to the hospital.
-Really. What did she die of?
-We don't know.
They didn't say.
I don't know. So it happened.
Now I'm alone here.
I'm killing time.
lt is difficult
to be alone.
I've got nothing to do.
We all die some day.
There's nothing to be done.
Muzaffer, where are the batteries?
-Look in the front pocket of the bag.
-Which front pocket?
How many front pockets
does the bag have?
-I'm all alone, my friend.
What's to be done? That's life.
No two go at the same time.
One of them always goes first.
That's life.
-Weren't they in the front pocket?
-l misunderstood you.
Take the camera.
See this part.
Read it down to here.
- Right.
Uncle Pire
you'll repeat what
Saffet will read you.
As if...
lt must sound realistic, yes?
-Yes.
Listen carefully.
Saffet, start. ''We went into
the villages to find food.
Again! As if you're telling the story.
Use your hands.
Right. ''We went into the villages
to find food.
We knocked on the door
and a man answered.
He said ''Maho''.
-Hold on, that's no sentence.
We knocked on the door and a man
answered. The sentence goes on.
lt continues with Maho.
-l read it like that. -God!
We knocked on the door and a man
answered. He said Maho.
And that's all.
Then we went to the next house.
Uncle Pire. You have to
say it as if you'd lived it.
I am saying it like he did.
But your hands are
on the table.
But you have to use your
hands and your eyes.
Yes, with your eyes.
Now repeat it again.
Read.
-He said ''Maho''.
And then suddenly on one of the
plains we came across the English.
We started
fighting them.
And so on, and so on.
That's it.
ls this a stable?
-Yes.
Let me have a look at that.
That's what happened.
My wife has gone.
What can l do.
It's God's will.
Saffet, it's late.
Let's go.
Uncle Pire.
-Have a good journey.
Thanks. I'm going back to
Istanbul in a couple of days.
I'll drop by
before l leave.
Okay?
-Yes, have a good journey.
Thank you.
-Definitely not. -Why not?
-We can't do it.
-You can mother. -We can't act.
-I've taken so many video films of you.
-That was just a family video.
-It's all the same.
-We're too old to act in a film.
-It will be the same.
I found a grandfather
but he can't act.
-Find another one, are they extinct?
-And he wants a lot of money.
-What money?
-Greedy chap.
What he does so wonderful
that he expects money?
It's difficult working with other people.
I plan to give the child's role to Ali.
Good choice.
Have you seen the old videos I took?
Let me show you.
Did I never show you them?
-Show them, but you
can't make us act.
lncredible inventions.
Do they shoot the movies
with these small cameras?
l look so old.
You look the same.
Of course I don't. Look at
the lines on my face.
Does video show up the
lines on the face more? -No.
It's going to rain,
l can hear thunder.
-It's from the video.
Really, from the film?
ls that a money box
or what?
It's the stove in the other room.
Time goes by so fast.
We're growing old.
Emin.
Wake up, go to bed.
-What's the time?
Quite late. Go to bed.
-l will.
What about you?
-l won't sleep yet.
I'm going to bed too.
It's very late.
Good night Mom.
-Good night.
Close the window.
-Yes.
It's cold outside.
I'll get the things ready
and come, allright mother?
Don't worry I'll drive carefully.
-Still, look out for actors.
-There's no need.
-We can't do it, son.
-You can.
-See you, Dad.
-Have a good journey.
-Do you have any musical watches?
-We do.
l want to listen to it.
-Do you have the money?
-I'll bring it tomorrow.
Can l listen to the music?
When my father gets back
tomorrow I'll bring the money.
Look.
Very nice.
-What are you doing Ali?
-Nothing.
We get nothing in return.
-Has any one rang me, Mum?
-No.
The meal's been
ready for ages. Sit down.
I'll take my shoes off and come.
l didn't clear the table
because you were coming.
Sit down.
lf there's anything
else you want I'll make it.
Eat.
Your father asked for you.
-So?
So what happened.
You've left the factory.
ls it easy to find a job?
-Stop nagging me.
Life isn't like that. -Leave off.
-You gave up that good job.
Can't you
be quiet?
How many jobs
have you had?
You got another one and left that too.
-I've had enough.
Come back, Saffet.
All right,sit down.
His grandfather went to the
trouble to get him to the factory,
But whatever jobs
they found he left them.
l know someone up the street like him.
They think earning
a day's bread is easy.
