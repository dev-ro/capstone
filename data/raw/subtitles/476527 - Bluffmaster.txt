Camera... Action!
Don't worry at all, madam.
It will be arranged.
Please do come. Thank you.
Movie stars...
They're no better...
...than cheap lap dancers...
Throw some money at
them and they dance!
But no money,
no action. Whores!
But something's got to be done.
How will the shoot
continue otherwise?
It is the first day of
your son's career.
You're the producer and
your son, the director.
If the star doesn't show up,
it will be so humiliating.
Become anything,
but not a producer.
I swear!
It's like one is made
the sacrificial goat all the time.
Don't get upset.
Go and talk to him calmly
Give him 2 million and say that...
...3 million will follow
the day after tomorrow.
Take this. - Okay.
Hello. Ok, listen...
No you listen to me.
I can't do it.
But this phone call...
- I had to. I didn't have a choice.
I cannot pay 10 million. Please!
You've got the wrong man.
No... You're the right man.
You are the godfather...
Even Rasul said that
you were the one to talk to.
I can't pay more than
4 million. - 4 million!?
Okay, 5. In cash!
I cannot pay more than that.
We don't even have to meet...
But please spare my dance bar.
Tonight at 11 pm,
Horniman circle.
You will find the cash
in the garbage bin there.
Hands up.
- I haven't done a thing!
Sir, we found the phone.
Sir, I haven't done a thing!
I'm not involved in all this.
That's always the case,
isn't it? One guy is the brain...
Another guy is the brawn...
And you are the ass.
Write this down: As per the rules,
we fired the first shot...
...in the air.
From there. Mark it.
Bajaj fired a retaliatory shot...
Mark that too.
Then Bajaj started running.
I'm not running!
I'm not running.
We chased him.
Hey, run after him.
Then, as per the rules,
we fired at his legs.
But he kept running.
- No, I'm standing still...
...And kept firing at us
Write this bit in capital letters.
It's the medal-clincher...
One of his shots hit our constable.
Now write the name
of the constable...
Hey, who wants
a medal this time?
Sir, it is my turn now.
C'mon over.
No Sir, not here.
The medal will come here...
Fire at his shoulder.
Sir, I carry my kids on my shoulders.
Fire at his leg.
- But how will I go out to fetch the milk?
Will the hand do?
But I'll need it to accept
'under the table' bribes?
Should I shoot you in the head?
Then your wife can...
...collect the medal.
Shut up and turn around.
Sorry sir.
Write: The bullet hit
Ghorpade in the thigh...
And then as per the rules,
we fired at Bajaj.
No sir!
Sir, I have a wife and kids.
Please let me go.
I have a family.
Sir, I have a lot of money.
You can take what you want. - Hey!
What do you think?
All policemen aren't for sale...
But some are. Like me!
"Create your own destiny..."
This is for the fake uniform.
This is for the fake policemen.
And this for the police vans.
Thank you, boss.
And this is yours Omar.
I've heard a lot of praise
about you, Roy.
Dog, swine, beep... beep...
Everyone says the
same thing about you.
Everyone warned me
not to trust you.
That's why I came prepared.
Omar, people short
on brains need bullets.
Put it down.
If you strain your finger...
...it'll be hard to count the bills.
Take that away.
What will you do with all this money?
I'll use some to stuff a pillow...
...some for the blanket.
I'll sleep with it and wake up with it.
It's all thanks to you...
Er, that's enough!
No boss, you're the best! The best!
That I am.
"...save your destiny
from getting wiped away"
His brain is lightning fast!
Hey babe! Come here.
I'm rich today...
...I need you...
Come with me tonight...
...l'll give you a share of what I've got.
Roy, you beep... beep

But love... that's something.
18000 rupees? On a man you
met barely 18 times!
Madam, these negatives are
really old, and damaged.
That's why it costs more. - It's okay.
Excuse me one minute. Simmi!
Think about how you could
spend those 18000 rupees...
Some new outfits,
ten visits to the beauty parlour...
...six pairs of shoes
You spent your money on
what made you happy, right?
Now consider this.
If Roy likes these photos,
how happy would I be...
Please... what syrupy lines.
Look, you never know with men.
At least the shoes will last
six months, maybe more.
No, Roy is not like that.
I trust him completely.
He is a very decent
and straight forward guy.
Where did you find these?
In your house,
when we were cleaning.
I thought I'd make you
some re-prints.
You don't like them,
do you? I knew it.
Tina was right.
I should've got you something else.
No. It is not that...
They are really very nice.
But I hope you didn't spend
a lot of money on them.
No! Not at all...
Thank god!
Why?
Because they're not mine,
they're my roommate's.
Roy!
So you did spend a lot. Right?
I was just kidding. They're mine.
Roy...
Thank you!
But why did you bother?
For this stupid smile of yours.
Sim, I've never been given
such a wonderful gift.
Thank you.
It's no big deal.
It's just a few old photos.
They're not just any photos.
It's my childhood you
brought back to me...
I hope your friend isn't a
stock broker like you?
Otherwise, we'll spend the evening...
...analyzing stock
prices and the sensex
He was a stock broker.
But not any more.
He did well for himself and got out.
Don't worry. I think you'll like
them both, him and his wife.
Is it a girl or boy?
Both... and they are planning
to adopt 2 more!
My friend loves children.
It's beautiful! - Isn't it?
He retired at the right time.
Now his wife is his life.
You never told me
about them earlier.
Are they very close to you?
Yes, very close.
Come on, I'll introduce you.
I love you, Simmy.
I know we've known
each other for just 6 months.
But since the first day I saw you...
...you've been on my mind constantly.
I can't see beyond you...
So...
Marry me... please!

I can't explain how hard it was...

We'll never be apart again.
Sometimes it feels like a dream.
It is a dream!
Yes, it's Sardarji...
yes, it's Jassi...
You at the office?
I've got the agreement and the cash.
Yes... cash... cash...
Why has it stopped now?
Isn't there a standby generator?
Isn't there an alarm?
See if there is an alarm.
I don't find any such thing.
What have I got myself into?
Is anyone there?
There's no reason to panic;
I'm here, aren't I.
I'm stressed out and
you're playing the hero.
Just Chill! I'll get you out of here.
He's opened it!
...He's like Superman...
a real saviour!
Give me your hand.
- Who are you talking to? - You!
First give me your bag.
- He's asking for my bag.
Be careful...
...otherwise I'm in big trouble.
Thank God! I am through.
Give me your hand.
- Ask for the bag.
No, give me your bag first.
Go ahead...
he's trustworthy after all...
Hey, what are you doing?
Shut your mouth. If you move,
you'll be chopped in two.
Do you think I am a fool?
I'd figured out your plan...
You think I'll give you my bag
so you can take off with it?
Listen brother,
you've misjudged me.
I don't even know this Sardar.
Shut up.
I'm the Bill Gates of
this kind of technology.
Meaning... you're one of us?
We're finished!
You're Aditya Shrivastav
- Call me Dittu.
Shut up and give me your other hand.
Dittu, leave it. Let's go home.
It is no fault of yours.
You're leaving me sandwiched here?
Jassi! Do something.
Next time, aim at the
prey and not the hunter.
Jassi, help! Get me out of here.
Cash or card?
No, 2 more cups of coffee.
You have ordered
10 coffees in the past 6 hours.
Yes, the coffee here is very good!
But you haven't drunk any.
I didn't find anyone
to drink it with.
You can't just sit here like this.
Okay.
This is getting really silly now.
What!? I'm enjoying the view.
What view?
There is nothing to look at.
Stop it!
Sometimes a person may
not like the view. That's normal.
But it's the first time
I've come across a view...
...that does not like a person.
Roy, what do you want?
Forgiveness. - You won't get that.
Okay, how about a cup of coffee.
I don't drink coffee.
No problem.
We can order tea.
Look Roy, I work here...
please leave.
Go ahead and wrap up your work.
We'll leave together.
Enough, Roy. Don't create
a scene! Just get out!
Is there a problem, Sir?
No sir. He was just about to leave.
I have to meet someone for tea.
I'll leave as soon as that's done.
Oh! That's fine.
One last cup.
Tonight 8 o'clock.
After that you go your way,
I go mine. - See you.
"You are King Kong...
You can do it!!!"
"You are King Kong...
You can do it!!!"
You are about to die.
No, you have no time...
No, you have very little time left.
Are you a doctor?
I am a doctor. Dr. Bhalerao.
I have to speak at a
conference on hypochondria.
It is a very dry subject.
I like to warm up with a joke...
Can I try this joke on you?
Just a minute!
It goes like this.
A patient goes to the doctor.
The Doctor says,
"You will not live long."
The patient asks how long?
The doctor says five.
The man screams
"Five... what five?"
"Five years?" The doctor says no.
"Five months?!" The doctor says no.
"Five weeks?" No!
The patient asks
how much time he has.
The doctor counts down...
5,4,3,2... 1. Done! You're done!
Didn't you like it?
My God, what should I do now?
Calm down, okay.
Good evening,
Ladies and Gentlemen!
I am Dr. Bhalerao,
I am going to talk about hypochondria.
It is just the cover for my spects.
Agreed... bye.
Relax! Relax!
Down! Down! It's war... bombs...
W're being attacked.
By Bangladesh!
There's gun shots!
Down! Get down!
Wait! You are hurt!
You were hit by a bullet. - Where?
Look... blood.
Its is your own blood!
Lallan! Lallan!
You idiot, lift this man up.
Where am I? - On top of me.
What happened?
A bullet hit you.
O God! Call an ambulance.
We don't have a phone.
Use mine. Take my card from
my wallet... call the hospital.
Tell them that Dr. Bhalerao has
been hit... they must hurry.
Tell them it's an emergency.
I need a handkerchief
to stop the bleeding.
We will do that later.
Easy! Easy!
But I can't feel any pain.
I don't feel anything.
In that case it's no point.
Let's go home.
Try now. - Okay.
Where is the bullet wound? - Here.
Let me look at it.
Don't do that.
You won't be able to bear it.
Check my pulse.
Where's the watch to time
the pulse? - Here.
My son, what's your name? - Lallan.
Lallan, please loosen my tie.
It is very tight.
Please do it slowly.
What's that noise? - Nothing.
I hear some strange noises.
- What noise?
I do hear some strange noises.
That's the sign of your mind
losing control... before death.
Got it! The ambulance is here!
What we must do is...
- I am a doctor. I know it.
Please take care of yourself. Okay.
Lallan! Take care of my briefcase.
Because I don't trust anybody.
Purse... Hey, bring the stretcher!
Take deep breaths...
Breathe in! Breathe out!
Will I... will I make it?
You will. But I can't say
the same about your shirt.
They did a post-mortem
on you and left.
Police! Police! Come with me,
you are my witness!
Relax. Forget the police, I'll tell you...
...where to find them.
Sim, I know I made a mistake.
But that life is behind me now.
I've changed.
I will do exactly what you say.
I've even returned all of
Mr. Bajaj's money.
You know you're so lucky
we didn't press charges.
Otherwise you would
be in jail right now.
I don't think so.
I would have escaped just to meet you.
I can't live without you, Sim.
And I can't live with you, Roy.
You're not able to forget any of it?
I am trying to forget... you...
It's not going to be possible.
Because you love me.
Do you even know what love is?
There are no lies
and betrayal in love.
But you obviously
don't know anything about that.
Roy, each time
you cheat one person...
...a lot of people suffer.
This time our relationship suffered.
You're capable of deceiving
anyone you like...
But if you think that
we'll ever be together again...
...you're only deceiving yourself.
Sim! - Thank you!!! Thank you!!!
It's because of you that
I recovered my stuff!
I told them not to mess with me.
The ketchup guy escaped,
but his partner was caught!
I am Bhalerao. Dr. Bhalerao.
Holy Spirit hospital.
For everything from a cold...
...to AIDS, I'll treat
you free of charge.
I'll get this one for you. Waiter!
Hey you... who claims
to be my father.
Hello, papa! Boss.
I'm sorry...
It was a very serious accident.
We had to amputate both your legs.
Otherwise your life
would have been in danger.
Are you back to your senses?
You! - You recognized me?
I thought you forget people
after you ruin their lives.
It's bound to hurt if you
pour a gallon of diesel...
...into your pint-sized petrol tank.
Why do you drink so much
when you can't hold your alcohol?
I didn't drink so much.
Everyone says the
same thing the morning after.
Anyway, I should have
let that car run you over.
Why did I bring you here?
But what can I do?
I have a big heart...
I can't see anyone in pain...
Neither a friend...
nor even an enemy.
Thanks to you I'm down 40,000
My partner's arrested, and...
The police are on my trail.
Even my jeans are torn.
This is the sort of thing...
...that would make Snow White
into the evil step-mother.
But what did I do?
I took you home, took care
of you, gave you my bed...
Sacrificing my own sleep,
so that you could sleep.
I'm the evil Step-mother
who became Snow White.
Thank you... I am very sorry.
But that doctor just
wouldn't let go of me...
I would like to cover your losses.
What will you recover?
My money... my friend.
My jeans... my time... my sleep?
What all will you pay for?
My pity for you...
that brought you here?
Can you pay for that?
I have promised.
Stuff got messed up because of me...
I want to set it right...
Please! What will you set right now?
You're just the wrong kind
of person to bother about.
My life isn't always
going to be this way...
My day will come.
Boss... boss...
I'm trying to apologize...
...but you're hammering on at me.
Forget the money.
Tell me what you really want
and I'll do it.
Really!?
Partners? Don't think so.
Ok, you are the guru and
I the devoted student. Happy?
Think about it boss!
All the great people
in our line of work...
Started off as partners. - Like?
Bonnie and Clyde...
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid...
Give me Indian names.
Billa and Ranga?
They were murderers!
Jai and Veeru?
They were fictional.
Give me real names.
Raman and Raghav!
Raman Raghav was one guy.
That's why he got caught.
That's my point!
You've got to listen to students sometimes...
Why are you sitting sideways?
Sit straight.
I have a revolver with me.
It needs space...
...so that nothing goes wrong.
If it goes off,
it'll blow a hole in your side.
Now listen carefully!
Lesson number 1.
In our profession
we don't use guns or bombs or knives...
All we use is... - Money!
The brain. - Right!
And that's always with you,
always loaded.
Only those people
who don't use their brains use bullets.
Guru, please...
Show me how it's done. The trick!
The trick does not lie
in how you con someone.
The trick is choosing who to con.
- What do you mean?
You must have heard
that it is very difficult...
...to fool an honest person.
Yes, that can be hard.
Lesson no. 2
What I just said is rubbish.
Exactly! What!?
There is nobody in the
world who cannot be fooled.
Meaning... rich or poor,
big shot or small fry, fat or thin...
If the bait is well-hooked...
The fish show up on their own.
Look around you, Dittu.
This world is an ocean.
And man is a fish.
The problem is that most
of these fish are all dried up.
You can chew all you want
but you'll stay hungry.
So it's better to leave those alone.
First is the 'Maandli'.
'Maandli' are those small ones.
Yes, I know them.
They taste great with a drink.
But you need at least
15 or 20 to feel full.
Right... Maandli.
To fill your pockets
you need 15 or 20 of them.
And that guy...
what type of fish is he?
He is a Goldfish. Flashy on the outside,
but really, a struggler.
Cheap cigarettes in an expensive pack!
So which fish are we interested in?
In Mumbai,
the Bangda Is a popular fish.
Sales executives,
marketing executives...
...9 to 6 office-going types...
If you get into that scene...
...you will have to work hard everyday.
The daily grind is not
my scene. I'd rather...
...catch a big one and chill
out the rest of the month.
Then the Pomfret's the one for you.
TV stars, doctors, lawyers,
bosses of small companies etc.
If you rob them then
you can take a month off.
And what if I want to
chill out for a year?
The whale then...
Big industrialists,
stockbrokers and the like.
They rule the world like
the whale rules the ocean.
So why don't we go for
the whales right away?
They are out of your reach...
Whales don't wander the
streets or take buses or cabs!
So forget it.
So we'll have to manage
with the pomfret...
You think you can manage even that?
If you can't manage
that much in Mumbai...
...then all you can do is
eat cheap, and pray hard!
Guru, what are we doing here?
Today's menu features:
Pan-fried Malhotra!
Mrs. Malhotra?
Good afternoon Madam.
We're from the Standard Bank,
Credit card division.
This is a small gift for you from us.
For me?! What for?
As per our offer...
Can you please open the door?
You will just have
to sign a few papers.
Hey Boss, I thought that
you would pull something big.
But you seem to be a saint.
If you don't dangle the bait
how will you catch the fish?
It's a lovely ring.
- Not as lovely as you are.
It must be expensive
- It is worth Rs. 7500.
Not a penny less or more.
It's all part of the offer.
But where is Mr. Malhotra?
Mr. Malhotra! - Please come in.
Mr. Malhotra! Mr. Malhotra,
right this way, sir.
Who are you? Excuse me!
We did not order a ring.
I know that. This is a gift from
our bank as per the offer.
What is this offer all about?
You'll get a gift worth 5o/o
of the total amount...
...you spend on this card.
If this ring is worth
Rs. 7500 it means...
...that you have made
purchases worth 150,000.
150,000! - We did?
- From your card? - Impossible!
Is this your statement?
Then this ring is yours.
How could there be
so much expenditure?
Let me tell you the details.
12th July, Rs. 1440,
dinner at Hotel Leela.
15th July, Rs. 12500,
Mumbai - Bangalore by Jet Airways.
On the 28th again a return
ticket from Bangalore.
Yes, for company work
I do travel frequently to Bangalore.
All the expenses should
not be more than 25000.
Let me see it.
There's a lot more, sir.
In Bangalore a carpet worth
3200 from Kashmir bazaar.
A dining table set worth
Rs. 35440, a double bed...
...and an easy chair
from Indoor Furnishings.
And Sleep well pillows
and mattress worth 7400.
You have a house in
Bangalore too? Nice weather!
Speak out...
why don't you say anything?
Ma'am, there's no reason to get upset.
He's spent on the home...
not a thing for himself.
A maternity dress from
Just Moms for 3000.
A maternity dress!
- You must have bought it for her.
He bought a pram of Bonny
Baby worth 13200. - A pram too!?
By the way, ma'am I must say,
you are in excellent shape...
After the baby.
Is it a boy or a girl?
Why don't you call
Bangalore to find out!
Sunita, pack the luggage.
Darling, it's all a misunderstanding.
Don't leave, please.
I'm not the one who's going - you are!
To Bangalore, to her who
on whom you spent 150000.
And I get the ring worth 5o/o!
I didn't buy all this stuff.
They must have made a mistake.
You don't have a second
house in Bangalore?
No. - No baby girl or boy?
No! Not at all!
Swear on your child
and tell the truth.
When I don't have a child,
what do you want me to do?
I think he is telling the truth, sir.
Someone else is responsible.
For the children?
No... - The credit card fraud!
Have we been robbed of 150000?
You've been saved
by the skin of your teeth.
Your credit card is insured
for 200,000. - Thank God!
Sir, please show me
your credit card. - Why?
Give it to them.
They are such nice people.
Just as I thought.
This has to be destroyed.
Just sign here please.
Your signature is very impressive!
We're all set. - What?!
Sir, I mean you're all set.
"I don't want to drink tea."
"I don't have the habit."
"Since I am a lonely bird..."
"...this trap has been laid out for me."
"That's why my mother..."
"...invited you over for tea"
Thank you Mr. Malhotra.
Let me remove the security tags.
My looks may be 5 on 10.
My physique... 7 on 10.
But when it comes to style
I'm 50 on 10! What do you think?
A white cane and a tin
cup is all that's missing.
Take it off...
This looks good.
- Did you like anything?
What do you think of this? - No.
So go and get it for me then!
That one's better.
Why are you following me, Roy?
I didn't follow you.
I had some work here.
Oh! So you are here for work!
Will you show me something in gold?
What are you today?
A lawyer? A doctor? An Inspector?
I came to tell you that you
and that guy look great together.
Okay, thank you!
Like brother and sister.
Amit is my fiance.
Does he make you laugh?
At least he doesn't make me cry.
He can't make you laugh or cry...
Which means he
doesn't move you at all...
And you're going to marry him?!
Sim, I don't know
how much he likes you.
But I do know that
no one can love you more than I do.
I'm getting late.
I've got to go. - Sim!
You can go as far as you like...
But I'll never be far from you.
Give me one last chance.
I've really changed.
Mr. Malhotra, your bill is ready.
Mr. Malhotra...
Mr. Malhotra...! You have changed?
Roy, do you know
what your problem is?
You will change not once,
but over and over again.
Move!
Just a minute sir.
Hey Roy!
Perhaps you've forgotten
to pay for something
I haven't purchased anything.
What do you want me to pay for?
Roy! I'll get you!
Larsen must have thanked
Toubro some time...
At least once.
What's wrong with saying
thank you just once?
Guru... can I tell you something?
That girl is not your type.
I don't think you both fit.
I mean, Gabbar may make
Basanti dance all he wants...
...but he can't marry her, can he?
Only Veeru can do that.
Do I look like Gabbar to you?
100o/o. The way you were
lying to that girl!
'Give me one last chance!
I have really changed! '
She's got a place in your heart,
that's obvious.
But conning people is in your blood.
You know what I'm saying.
Sunil, its Roy. MH 14P 1713...
Maroon Mercedes...
I want the name and address quickly.
I want popcorn and some sandwiches.
And two glasses of
something cold to drink.
Listen. He is a senior Income Tax officer.
Be careful, or this theatre will be raided.
Hurry up.
Sir, how was Mulchandani caught...
...Despite all his contacts?
That is history now!
His big contact landed him in big trouble.
He warned him about
the raid and advised him...
...to stash all his cash somewhere.
Then...?
The fool stashed the money
in his neighbour's house.
And where did the raid take place?
In his neighbour's house!
Hello... Namaste Yes sir...
We're just watching a movie.
A raid? No problem.
It'll be done. 20-25 officers...
Tell me the name and address.
Hey, take it down.
Pratish Shah! And his address?
1411, Gulmohar Building, Pali Hill.
He has a Mercedes too!
Don't worry, sir.
He'll be begging for change
for his bus fare after this!
We'll be at his house at 3.
I'll hang up now.
The difficult part is over.
Now the lamb will come
to the butcher.
He is going to enter the
lift with his money...
...and we will take him for a ride!

The tumor is quite big already, Roy.
This is the control center of the body.
If it functions, we do.
And we function only if it does.
What do you mean?
Chemo, surgery, lasers... what?
None of that can help you.
You're beyond treatment.
There has to be something.
We're in the 21st Century, damn it.
Had we known earlier,
we could have done something.
But now...
Now? What happens next?
As the tumor grows...
various organs will start to malfunction.
Taste and smell are the first to go...
your vision will blur...
And when the tumor grows to here...
...it's your respiration...
How much time do I have?
You could ask for a second opinion.
Come on doc, how long will I live?
Three months.
What happened to you,
Boss? Wait a second!
I found this card in your
pocket and brought you here.
Turns out this doctor is the
one who was looking for me...
...so waited outside.
Stop it!
I've seen people pass out after drinking.
But this is the first time...
I've seen two pegs knock a man out.
Stop it!
Why? I'm the one who
had to take care of you.
It was like the Qutub Minar
resting against the Taj Mahal.
Didn't you hear me?
Don't shout brother.
You're my teacher and all but...
It's a question of self-respect.
Your lessons are done. Understood?
You go now. I will see
you tomorrow, okay? - Okay.
Bye! - Bye, sweetheart.
Roy, what are you doing here?
Sim! Hi!
Go home, Roy. You're drunk.
But I am more sober than ever. Really!
What do you want?
They say that when
God gives, he gives generously...
But when he takes... - So what?
I can trick any one.
You're the one who said that.
But how do I pull this off?
- What do you mean?
How do I trick Death?
Sim... I'm dying!
And I can't do anything about it.
How can you stoop so low?
What did you think?
This melodrama would work?
That I'd burst into tears
and rush into your arms?
Why would you believe me?
Just stop it now
He's my doctor.
What are you paying him for this?
If a cheat gets cheated,
who cares, right? - Exactly!
And even if this were true,
I wouldn't be crying.
Because I'm done crying over you.
You're very lucky,
Roy... very lucky.
Anyone can count
the days they have lived...
But nobody knows
how long they will live.
Except for you, Roy.
I hope you get to know
that about yourself soon too.
You don't understand...
A famous poet once said:
"O life, wait!" No. He said,
"O life, stop!" Or was it "Sit."
No, no. Life can't sit
Mine is heading for the eternal sleep...
Please, I have very
little time left. Spare me.
Sorry. I'm sorry. I forgot the poem.
My daughter is very fond of poetry.
She shared it with me.
Urvashi... She is 22 years old.
All the guys in college
are crazy about her.
She's very beautiful... my genes.
Do you know when
I found her most beautiful?
The day she was born.
I was right there in the delivery room.
And they handed me this baby...
all bloody and slimy...
She was so beautiful.
I will never forget that day.
You must have many similar memories...
Doctor, I'm not married,
I don't have kids...
...and I will never have any.
You don't understand,
Roy. Look, Roy!
Roy! You still don't get it.
It's these precious moments
that constitute a life.
...that transform the
mundane into the unforgettable...
When I was little...
the first time that I rode a bicycle...
...my father ran alongside,
holding the seat.
Listen to me. He was running alongside...
...and I kept turning back, asking...
'Dad, are you there?
Dad, are you there? '
He said 'You've got to look
ahead... look ahead.'
After a few moments
I turned my head again to see...
...that he was standing quite
a distance away, smiling.
And I had learned to ride a bicycle.
I'll never forget that day.
Never. Do you understand me?
The amazing thing is,
I got to relive that day...
Only this time
I was holding the seat...
...and my daughter
Urvashi was riding the bicycle.
"No... no turning back...
Look ahead. Look ahead.'
'Dad, are you there?
Dad, are you there? '
And I let go.
When she turned back
and looked at me...
...she was smiling.
Just like you are, Roy.
Tell me, how many such
days do you remember?
Your first job! Your first suit!
Our first salary!
The first time you held
a girl's hand? Your first kiss?
Your first love?
How many such days
do you remember? Tell me!
15... 20... 25... 30?
Thirty special days, right?
You've lived 30 years and
you remember just 30 days?
What happened to the other days?
Now, you have 90 days to live...
You can kill that time
thinking about death,
Or you can live 3 lifetimes
in those 90 days.
Is he a parking valet or
a Schumacher wannabe?
Our hotel doesn't
offer valet parking, sir.
Follow that car, fast!
