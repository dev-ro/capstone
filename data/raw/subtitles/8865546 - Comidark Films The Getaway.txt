Isaac!
Did you see the rope?
Just find a new catchphrase.
-Where did you go? Bodrum? Kas?
-Both!
Here it is, brother.
-The management is about to change.
-Yes, I heard.
I heard they'll interview everyone
and pick which employees stay.
They'll ask about your current tasks,
about your future and everything.
-What exactly will they ask?
-I'm not sure, brother.
All right, go upstairs.
-What's up, Brother Mehmet?
-Onder is waiting for you.
-Morning.
-Morning.
I found your shirt in with my shirts,
so I washed it too.
No worries, I have another one.
Isaac, fetch me some mineral water
with lemon.
-You should drink less alcohol.
-Do you know what Neyzen Tevfik said?
No, what did he say?
Probably not "drink less."
Just beat it.
It's for your own health, for you.
-The management is about to change.
-Huh?
Have you heard about it?
What are you going to do?
Start a mutiny on the boat?
No, it's not like that.
What if they kick us off the boat?
Sir Isaac, would you please be kind enough
to bring me some soda with lemon?
Yes, sir! Are you listening
to what I'm saying?
I don't think anything will change.
It's just an interview, just a formality.
You can take care of it.
You know, captain,
I'll get my teeth fixed.
It won't be a problem, right?
-How long have you been here?
-14 years. Just because of the teeth...
That won't be a problem. Don't worry.
All of you will keep your jobs.
Yeah, but you know, there is...
It's all right! Just keep your chin up.
Go on.
Thank you.
-How do you find these videos?
-I found this one last night.
Brother Metin.
-What's that?
-It's funny, you know.
-Bullshit!
-Brother Mehmet, look.
Payments!
Two glasses of tea.
Thank you. Collecting payments!
-Here, keep the change.
-Thank you.
-Have you got hair implants, brother?
-I wish I had gotten them last week.
You know, I'm getting a dental implants.
Does it hurt?
No, brother. It doesn't.
Brother, please take your feet down.
-All right.
-It looks good, though.
What the fuck did he say?
Such a character.
Brother.
Yes, add some more!
A family of four could make dinner
with the amount of cheese that girl eats.
-I'll report you to the captain.
-Just mind your own business.
We'll see.
And this idiot even claims
she is his fianc√©e.
Is there anything in my teeth?
There's not!
There is fucking nothing there.
What are you laughing at?
Look, set me up with the chubby girl
and I'll keep quiet, huh?
My sweetheart.
Isaac, the toast is tasteless
whenever you're not around.
I've told them many times,
"This is how Miss Songul likes her toast."
This one needs more sauce.
Let me get some more.
-More?
-Right.
So, tell me. What's up, handsome?
Everything is fine.
I was on a vacation with my parents.
You still haven't let me
do the Titanic scene here.
Well, there are passengers around.
Have you seen this video? Wait, look.
Look here, please have a look.
Isn't it really something?
Dido, take a photo of us.
But with that effect.
You're taking a photo
of me on my own?
It's really good.
-Send it to me later.
-Sure.
-I'll get back to work.
-Okay, go ahead.
-Here.
-Right, thank you.
Ercan!
Take this.
Hello, have a good day.
Is the captain up top?
No, he's down below.
Of course he's up top.
Where would a captain be?
Thank you.
That's the guy.
He decides who stays and who gets fired.
You don't say.
I guess you plan on working here
for many years to come.
Well, yes, I'm happy here.
Get me some mineral water with lemon.
Brother Salih, do you think
this is a mini-bar or something?
Not mini, something huge.
All right, put it on my account.
I'll pay.
What are the questions?
You're scared out of your wits, right?
Well, be scared, you faggots.
Give me that.
Mr. Ferit, I have all your information
in this file.
You've been working here for four years.
Here, hot tea.
Thank you.
-We'll talk again later.
-Thank you.
-Sorry, my hands are all sweaty.
-No worries.
Metin Arici!
Tell him you let the girls
eat the whole buffet. Confess.
-Fuck off!
-Go on.
-Metin Arici?
-Yes, sir.
I've been working here for 14 years
with my beloved friends.
My only problem is with my teeth.
I've got an appointment to fix them.
And...
I don't think it'll be a problem.
I'll get them fixed.
Mr. Metin, do you live on this boat?
-Temporarily.
-For six years?
Excuse me.
Hello, yes?
Okay.
Headquarters.
Okay.
Okay.
We serve here
with a cheerful attitude and...
Mr. Metin, I have my notes on you.
That's all for today.
I guess it's setting off, is it?
It is.
Have a good day.
You too.
What did he ask?
He asked if it was setting off.
-What did you say?
-I said it was.
With cheese, pepperoni! Lemonade!
Just save some money already
and propose to that girl, Isaac.
Mind your own business for God's sake.
Why the hell do you hide the straws?
I couldn't find them anywhere yesterday.
Brother, these are mine.
Yours are there.
How do I know that you don't
pick your nose with them or something.
These are mine.
-Seriously.
-Go fuck yourself!
Don't get The Uncle angry.
Yes.
3800 liras for a temporary implant?
Oka... Okay.
Just the three teeth.
Can I come tomorrow?
Temporary implants.
I need them by Friday, though.
Yes.
All right, brother.
Thank you, Brother Sinan.
Isaac.
They want you on the top floor.
All right, okay.
The boat won't be operating tomorrow.
No tours to Sirkeci.
Some film crew will be
filming on the boat.
But the buffet will be running
and being served.
All right.
-Who will be working tomorrow?
-Captain, everyone will be here.
But I have an appointment tomorrow,
I'll have to leave to get my teeth fixed.
Teeth? Which teeth?
-These front teeth.
-That's okay. You'll figure it out.
Okay.
Don't get them fixed.
You are more beautiful like this!
Don't get nervous, seriously.
Just play the part written here.
Here it is.
Just go ahead and work on it
somewhere silent.
-How long do we have?
-One minute.
Okay, let's hurry up a little.
It would take at least two days
but I'll get it done in a day.
-What was that jerk's problem?
-Sir, he is just a little nervous.
Will we film some scenes up top?
-Yes, that'd be nice. Check it out.
-Yes, sir.
-Darling, what is it you're filming here?
-Sir, you'll have to leave that spot.
Burak!
-Take care of Mr. Kivanc.
-Okay.
-Is it a film or TV series?
-It's a movie. Art house.
Brother Salih, did you hear that?
It's fart house.
Nice.
Good morning!
-What's up, brother?
-Bring me my shirt, jacket and tie.
Hold on, wait.
Open it. The door.
-Good morning.
-My hero.
-What is it?
-It's with cheese.
And it's still hot. You are so nice.
Ayran. We won't be working today.
-This is the way you like your toast.
-You are such a cutie.
They'll probably have pepperoni.
Right, thank you, sweetheart. Kisses.
-Street coffee?
-Huh?
-Hello, Mr. Metin.
-We could serve you coffee.
-The film crew is here. Did you know that?
-No.
-What are they filming?
-Nothing like G.O.R.A.
I have an appointment with the dentist
today. Do you mind if I leave?
I'll interview you on Friday, Mr. Metin.
You know, I just made a joke
about G.O.R.A.
Have a good day.
All right, Mr. Salih. Thank you.
Mr. Mehmet, please.
Okay.
-Why do they call you The Uncle?
-Because of my experience.
-You've been on boats for 36 years?
-Unfortunately.
Brother Salih, what did he ask?
-He asked if I drank alcohol.
-You must've said "never."
Right, I said I was injecting it
through my ass.
Dipshit!
What did I say?
-So, is it done?
-Yes, it is.
Look, don't overreact. Just relax.
You'll go, serve the tea,
and leave the scene. That's it.
-He can't do that.
-That faggot got stuck. He can't.
-Look at the way he holds the tray.
-He just can't do it.
-Okay but am I angry or relaxed?
-For God's sake. What?
You are relaxed. You'll bring the tea,
and leave the scene. That's it.
-Okay, but am I...
-Just stop!
Darling, what's wrong with you?
Do you think this is Hamlet?
Just bring the tea and leave.
Who was your mentor? Who taught you?
-What was the last film you starred in?
-Annemin Yarasi.
Obviously. Get out! Solve this problem.
Okay, sir.
I told you a hundred times to relax.
Sir, could you please put this on
and serve the tea?
-With the red jacket?
-Yes.
-Sure.
-Whoa!
Come on.
-With this?
-Yes, yes.
-Sure I can.
-Okay, we're waiting for you.
-Sir.
-Sir!
-Sir!
-Go on brother.
Sound is on, and the camera.
Go.
Serve the tea.
Smile.
Smile.
Don't look at the camera.
Don't smile.
Don't smile.
Leave the scene.
-Way to go! It was nice.
-Beautiful.
-You've just become a star.
-It was very nice, sir.
Thank you, sir. You know it's hard.
-Fuck off.
-Were you nervous?
-Did you hear what he said?
-What did he say?
Sir, can I please take the jacket back?
That's it, then. Sirkeci is the last stop.
Let me take it, here.
But how? How did that happen
at the last minute?
The exchange rate? Why?
200 Turkish liras.
Why?
It's imported?
Why is it imported?
Okay, I'll be leaving soon. The exchange
rate has put me in a tough spot.
Okay.
Okay, hoping for the best.
All right, I'll be on my way now.
Thank you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Sir.
Where are you going?
-Why did you change your clothes?
-I gave the red jacket back.
Merve! Come on, you can't do that.
You'll have more scenes.
The director will film you
in wide angle, now.
I have an appointment. I need to leave.
Sir, no, you can't do that.
You are on the loop.
Look, you wanted me to serve tea
and I did. I need to leave now.
Sir, you can't do that.
-You just can't.
-What? Why?
We've already filmed you.
You are in the loop.
But I have to go.
I have a dentist appointment. Please.
All right, why don't you take this?
Take it and don't go anywhere.
For 100 liras?
Sheesh! All right, here is 200 liras.
Take it, 200 liras. But you can't leave
here for three hours. Okay?
Come on. All right. We agreed.
200 liras, two hours.
And you'll give me the red jacket
at the end.
All right, the red jacket will be yours.
But promise me,
you won't leave this place.
You'll be here. Okay?
-I'll be here!
-Okay, the jacket will be yours.
Come on, guys. come on! Gather round!
We'll start recording.
Brother Sinan.
Something's come up. For two hours. Huh?
Going on a vacation?
Brother. I'll come very early
in the morning tomorrow. Huh?
Would that be okay, early in the morning?
Because I have an interview.
Please. I'll be there
as early as possible.
All right, text me.
Text me.
Thank you, thank you so much.
Aren't you leaving, brother?
Why do you care? I have scenes here.
Merve.
-Let's also film it like this.
-All right, sir. Ready!
Stop shaking it, buddy.
Sound is on. Camera.
Act.
-Don't go anywhere.
-I'm here.
So called geniuses...
Of course I wouldn't leave
without taking the jacket.
Film crews are just stupid, seriously.
They film the same thing 50 times.
You do the same stupid things
100 times a day.
At least they'll have a movie.
You don't even have that.
What did he ask during the interview?
There are some wrongdoings here.
I told him that, too.
I don't give a fuck if I get fired.
I'll call no man "mister" at this age.
You're all trippin' balls here.
Buttering him up and kissing his ass.
What's up?
I have no such agenda.
You all act like "I'm in a bad mood
because they abuse my good intentions."
Just stop acting.
What could happen to a decent employee?
-What if they fire you?
-So fucking be it!
Better than kissing ass.
Here.
-What's that?
-A cocktail.
Drink one shot and you won't be able
to say "Daddy," even if you see your dad.
-Don't be afraid. Drink up.
-I'm not afraid.
What the hell?
Do you really drink this?
Give it here.
What?
The film crew wants a bucket.
The film crew. They want a bucket.
-What fucking bucket?
-A bucket.
All right, you go up. I'll be there.
You didn't help at all.
What fucking bucket?
The vests...
Vests...
-You can't touch them.
-The vests!
Motherfucker!
Shut it down! Shut it! Shut down!
-Sir, what are you doing?
-Get off me! Who took my money?
-Isaac!
-Come forward!
-Sir, what are you doing?
-Get away! Who took my money?
-Isaac!
-Who brought the life vests?
Come forward!
-Sir, calm down.
-Come forward, whoever you are!
-Hold him!
-Who took my money? Who!
-Calm down!
-Get away! Who took it?
Isaac, enough! What's going on?
I have had enough of you.
You kept calling me "sir," but...
Fuck you and your fucking kerchief!
Isaac!
I'm deeply sorry for the inconvenience.
He just made a mistake for a moment.
That's absurd. Who would want his money?
We're not used
to these kinds of accusations.
-You're right.
-Please, sir.
I apologize, again.
Do you hide your money among the vests?
I do.
Now, fuck off.
-What's up, dude?
-I'll hold you all responsible!
Why did you make a scene, for God's sake?
I had 3800 liras in that envelope.
Whoever took it should come forward.
What's it? Did captain scold you?
See, I'll stab whoever did that with this!
-Dude, are you insane? Calm down.
-Who took it? You must've taken it!
-Why would I take your fucking money!
-Hold on! Don't hit him, wait!
Isaac, have you lost your mind?
Nobody would steal your money.
Whoever knew where the money was
must've taken it.
All right, just go on.
Go ahead and wash your face!
I'll find him! I will!
Motherfucker.
Isaac?
Yes?
Coffee for the captain.
Okay, I'm coming.
Look, don't get on my nerves.
Do you think what you did was acceptable?
Acting like a child to a stranger...
That's not who you are.
I swear to God I'll beat you. I mean it.
Leave the coffee there.
Tomorrow morning at eight.
Or else two weeks later.
What's up, big man?
-Where is Songul?
-Not here.
-Is that with cheese?
-It is.
Let me take that, too. Thanks.
Take it easy!
Come on.
Come on.
-Are you okay?
-Fine, fine.
The teeth? What happened to your teeth?
It's temporary.
Go to the right side.
Keep going.
Come on.
What's up?
-What's up, brother, how are you?
-Just fine.
-Have you got the implants?
-Yes, it's temporary though.
-Whoa!
-How does it look?
-It looks cool.
-When is the interview?
-He didn't tell us.
-Didn't he?
It's nice, right?
-It's great.
-Let me take a walk, then.
Here you go.
Fifteen liras for soda.
-Thanks.
-Thank you.
What's up?
-Here, take this.
-Okay, brother.
-Twenty and 15 liras.
-Okay.
-When will this guy show up?
-I don't know, he didn't say anything.
Well, of course, we've spent
the last six years here together.
We are practically a family. And...
It's fundamental to this business
to have a cheerful attitude.
I mean, if you can't smile
then you should leave the job.
Mr. Onder, that's all for today.
We'll talk again, thank you.
Right, thank you.
-Would you like some toast?
-No, thank you.
Metin Arici, it's your turn.
Just give me five minutes.
The way I see it,
the employees on the boat
should be the face of the boat,
with a smile on our faces.
I mean, with a positive attitude
and kind words.
You know, they made the seamen
look so bad in Gemide.
-Like what?
-I mean, not like what Erkan Can did...
The people working on boats
can be shown in a nicer way.
More sympathetic, you know.
For example, I got my name from Isaac.
You know, the one on TV.
Love Boat, I know it.
People like you a lot here.
Yes, just like him. More sympathetic
and cute, with a smile on our faces.
And he has this move, like that. Boom!
Isaac is the bartender on that show.
They sell alcohol, we don't, but anyway...
The employees here can be the face
of the boat with smiles on our faces.
That's how I see it.
Mr. Metin, have you got a dental implant?
It's temporary, there'll be
another layer on top.
-Toast?
-It's on the house.
They call you Isaac. Okay.
Our motto is "Smile with the waves."
The teeth look really good. I mean it.
It's temporary.
Mr. Metin.
I'll ask this openly.
A theft took place on the boat yesterday.
I'm sorry, what?
Some money was stolen
and then a ring went missing.
We are like a family on the...
Mr. Isaac, relax.
It'd be better for you.
I'll just stamp the document
and be done with it.
I don't know. It's not possible.
Anything out of the ordinary?
Just the film crew's arrival.
Nothing more.
Okay.
I'll stamp it, then.
Congratulations, Isaac. Welcome aboard.
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
-What was the phrase?
-Thank you.
No.
-Smile with the waves.
-Smile with the waves.
Do the thing.
-Smile with the waves!
-Ha!
Very nice, Mr. Isaac. Bravo.
We'll see each other again.
Mr. Isaac.
Relax.
It's just us.
Is there no son of a bitch on this boat?
-I mean, of course there is.
-Huh?
You'll give me their names one by one,
Brother Isaac.
That's my number.
Well, Onder is one of them.
Onder.
Who is Onder?
He works upstairs, with the cook.
Nice, we'll continue like this. Slowly.
We'll have the control.
Text me whenever you see anything.
Agreed?
I'm tired of eating meatballs.
Isaac, come on, hug it out. Make peace.
-Never mind. That's all right.
-Onder, would you like to have some?
I won't eat.
What's up?
Have you found the captain's ring?
No, dude.
He probably dropped it somewhere
but he makes us look for it.
You know last year some douchebag
dropped his car keys in the sea
while trying to throw food for seagulls.
It's probably something like that.
He probably dropped it somewhere.
Nobody suggested looking
for my money yesterday
when the film crew was here.
Now you are worried about the ring?
How did you get your teeth fixed
if you lost your money, bastard?
These are not actual teeth, they're
implants, you illiterate shit-lord.
Come on, handsome. Why so tense?
Just relax already.
-The teeth look good, though, right?
-Yes, he finally looks like a man.
-Who is drinking the oralet?
-Brother Onder.
Everyone is supposed to write it down
when they get something from the buffet.
Isaac, mind your own business.
You know I'll beat you up good.
-Is that so?
-Yes.
What the hell are you talking about?
Oralet and shit?
Very well, Mr. Burhan. Very well.
He is really tripping.
-Hello.
-Hello.
Sir, here are the names. Onder and Burhan.
This Burhan character sells
banned tobacco on the boat.
And Onder steals cheese from the buffet.
Burhan and Onder. All right.
-Hey.
-Yes?
Okay, hang up.
All right.
Ercan.
Whoa. This is the jacket
from the film crew, right?
No, of course not.
We haven't even got used to the teeth.
And now this style. It's really something.
You'll get used to it, don't worry.
Are we allowed to wear them, too?
We'll see.
Yes, sir, I understand,
but can't I talk to...
All right, sir.
Good evening.
Onder, what's up?
I got fired, Uncle.
Who says so?
For God's sake.
-Good evening.
-Darling.
Isaac, your teeth! I can't believe it!
It's temporary, it's nothing.
Dido! Turn on the flash light. Let me see.
Come on. It's temporary.
-The teeth on the front, right?
-It's nothing.
Also, they're putting me
in charge of the buffet.
There is a revolution on the boat.
-Guess what.
-What is it?
I'm getting married!
Don't keep saying it, it's bad luck.
-What? How?
-Look at the ring.
Solitaire ring, it's gorgeous.
I'll get some more sauce.
Why did this happen? I mean why?
Dude, stop joking. I'm 32 years old.
But you know what? I'll miss your toast.
I'll come eat it every now and then.
This Ercan is such an idiot.
It's a videocall. How does my hair look?
-It's fine.
-Okay.
See you later, darling.
Why did this happen? Why?
She is getting married to the son
of our boss. Some punk.
-When did this happen?
-After the ring of course.
-The ring? What ring?
-Nobody can resist the ring.
Very well. See you later.
Brother, take these away.
-You can keep it.
-Watch your tone.
Okay, brother. Take care of yourselves.
Farewell.
Brother Salih.
You remember my Songul, right?
She's getting married.
She was messing with you.
She was never your Songul.
That was nasty.
I see everyone wants to slap me
whenever something bad happens.
But nobody says well done
when something good happens.
How do you know she was fooling around?
My money is gone, my girl is gone.
All you do is to lecture me.
You just keep lecturing me.
"Be smart, Isaac. Take it easy, Isaac."
Huh, here it is.
Do you know they put me in charge
of the buffet today?
Do you have any lectures to give now?
Of course you don't.
I don't give a fuck,
even if they make you a king.
Every drunk person thinks
they are Neyzen Tevfik somehow.
Taking the high road and all.
You're drunk. Fuck off.
I'm not drunk, I'm intoxicated.
Now, I need some help for you to progress.
The others must be at your level,
that's why.
There is this guy, Salih.
He is always drunk. He drinks on the boat.
I can tell you that.
Salih, okay. Good evening.
Good evening.
They keep abusing you
while you keep smiling.
You shall not smile!
Look at this! It's dirty everywhere.
Why don't you clean this mess?
The whole place is covered in oil.
Take these away!
-Ercan, are these yours?
-Yes, brother.
-They're the bills from this morning.
-I don't care!
I want you to write down
anything you take from the buffet!
Clean the machines, too.
I know how to make you get in line.
Everyone should watch their step.
Don't stare at me!
Brother Salih, give me your blessings.
You got it, Brother Mehmet.
-Take care of yourself.
-Thanks, Bahri.
Take care.
You know, it's good. From now on
you are on a permanent vacation.
Even you ended up lecturing people.
Lecturing is good. You know.
What the hell are you doing here?
Do you think you own...
Do you think you own this sauce?
Why do you serve it so much?
-What's going on?
-Brother, it was for Didem.
Don't get me started on Didem!
Nobody has privileges...
Look, everyone must know
their place here.
Understood? Everyone!
You are just one call away
from getting fired. I'll report you all!
Do whatever you want to, you sick fuck!
Acting like he owns the place.
All right, my love. That's okay.
Just give me a slice of lemon.
Ten liras!
You'll charge her! Ten liras.
Everyone must know their place!
Mr. Metin.
-Smiling with the waves, are we?
-Of course.
Mr. Ercan, let's talk.
Ercan.
Put a smile on your face, buddy.
We're cool, right?
Excuse me.
Look, we are brothers. Everything is fine.
Put a smile on your face. Smile.
We'll all be done if we don't smile.
Just smile a little.
I'm your brother. Look at me.
-How about some romance?
-Sure.
Isaac?
What the fuck are you doing?
What is going on?
He's just a waiter.
Fetch me a glass of soda.
Do you want something?
No.
Run and get it. What are you waiting for?
-Could you please bring me some tea?
-Too late!
You'll pay for this!
I'll make you pay for it.
Let's see now.
Bitch!
Open it.
Open. Here you are!
-What are these?
-The lady's bills for toast.
Look, do you know who I am?
Do you know who I am?
-Isaac, Ethem. Come on.
-Stay out of it.
You know I'll cut you in half.
Dude, what are you doing?
Sorry, mister. Come on Isaac.
Dude, why the hell are you
having a fight with a customer?
Go on, keep moving! Go on!
-Customer? You'll get what you deserve.
-Come on.
-Just wait. You'll get it.
-Keep moving.
Having a fight with a customer, huh?
It's your turn, now. Make the final move.
All right, well...
Ercan.
Don't mind that thief bastard.
I'll take care of him. It's your turn.
Isaac.
Everyone is walking on thin ice.
I can only trust you on this boat.
From now on, I'll do whatever you say.
Here.
The keys and documents for the boat.
Some interesting things are going on.
Hey you, listen to me very carefully!
Bahri, Ferit and Mustafa.
You'll leave the boat.
Because you don't belong here.
Zeynel, goodbye to you, too.
-What happened to us, Isaac?
-Aren't we a family?
You watch too many movies, buddy.
Art house movies.
Now get the fuck off my boat!
Only those worthy
of the boat will work here.
Me, for example!
Bravo, it's good.
Keep showing your teeth. Standards
on the boat are getting better.
I heard some rumors about your love life.
What's going on?
Nothing.
You don't mix your love life
with business, right Alex?
-Isaac.
-Don't you think Alex is better?
For a gentleman like you. Alex.
Alex.
Huh.
What about the captain's ring?
I'll tell you something about the captain.
No, wait. Let me text you.
The captain is no more.
You have the wheel, Alex.
Gayrettepe to Sirkeci port.
I'm leaving the docks.
Everyone will watch their step.
Pepperoni and cheese sandwich.
Lemonade.
Pepperoni and cheese sandwich.
Pepperoni and cheese sandwich.
I'm here.
Pepperoni and cheese!
Pepperoni and cheese.
Songul!
- Songul!
- Isaac.
Isaac.
He beats me. I'll divorce him.
I'll go there to pick up my stuff, but I'm
afraid. What if he does something bad?
Don't be afraid.
Nobody can do anything to you
on this boat. I'm here for you.
Hush. Please don't speak.
-Let's do the Titanic scene, shall we?
-Songul.
Let me pick up my stuff, then we can
forget about everything, huh?
-Would you like some toast?
-Sure, darling.
Sirkeci Port, Gayrettepe.
I'm nearing to the dock.
-Isaac, there he is, standing there.
-Let me see.
-Don't be afraid.
-What am I going to do?
Songul!
Songul!
Get down here!
Why don't you come to me
if you are man enough? Come on.
Come on!
Isaac, please.
Wait for me here.
I told you I'd cut you in half, right?
They always say that, buddy.
Take a look, do you remember it?
It's the captain's ring you stole
and sold.
I don't steal any fucking ring!
Lovely.
You get to steal.
You get to take over the boat.
And then you get to have the girl.
Which movie is that?
Ethem, I have nothing to lose.
You are young.
It'll be a shame
if something happens to you.
I'll put your teeth to the ground.
These are not teeth you idiot,
they're temporary implants.
My teeth!
My teeth!
You look so handsome like that.
Fuck you!
Isaac!
Look what he did to my teeth.
But it's okay. I can get them fixed.
I swear.
-Seriously.
-Isaac, behind you!
Ethem! Leave him alone!
Ethem!
Thief.
-I'm not!
-You are.
-I'm not a thief!
-You are.
-Ethem, please!
-I'm not a thief!
Please leave him be, please!
Thief.
-I'm not!
-You are.
Come on, now, Isaac.
It tickles.
Smile with the waves.
You just became a murderer.
A murderer.
I didn't do anything.
It's survival of the fittest.
Anybody would do the same thing.
They do it anyway. Don't they?
Are you just anybody?
I'm not, right?
Everything will be all right.
I'm not a murderer. It'll be all right.
Everything will be all right.
I'm no thief. It'll be all right.
Everything will be all right.
I'm not anybody. You are not anybody.
-I'm not anybody.
-Isaac, welcome aboard.
Who can resist the ring?
Isaac.
-Isaac?
-Yes?
Coffee for the captain.
Okay.
You just keep perplexing me.
Huh?
See. What is this?
It was under some chair.
And you were screaming around
for your money.
Here, take this you dummy.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Of course. Of course I am.
But I got so scared.
All right, okay. Get back to work.
What's up? You found the money.
Thank God he did
or else he'd make us all suffer.
Come on, don't be like that.
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.
I was so scared, I swear.
Your girlfriend shouldn't hear about this.
I don't have one.
Come on.
Metin Arici!
-You make everyone here smile.
-I smile, too.
Sir, please don't make a problem
out of the teeth.
I swear I'll get them fixed.
It's not a problem, Mr. Metin.
-It's not?
-It's not.
The company's insurance
will cover it, anyway.
-Really?
-That's not a problem.
-You've been here for 14 years, right?
-Yes.
Here is what I think.
This is my opinion, of course.
I say you should keep on like this...
I'll write that down.
Congratulations, Mr. Metin.
Because I like hardworking people.
Thank you. Everyone on this boat
is really hardworking.
I've been here for 14 years,
working shoulder to shoulder with...
I'll ask for a favor.
Please take positive notes
for Onder here at the buffet,
for Brother Ercan, Brother Salih
and everyone else.
Please let them keep working together.
We should be grateful for them. Please.
Don't you worry, Mr. Metin.
Now I realize why they call you Isaac.
You know, cuteness and all.
It's just Isaac.
I'm not an Alex.
I sometimes live in between.
Mr. Metin, don't worry.
Your case is closed.
-Thank you.
-Don't worry.
Do the thing.
-Smile with the waves.
-Bravo.
Bravo, Mr. Metin.
