The lesson about human brain is very
important to every medical student.
Our brain co-ordinates
every action we indulge in.
Our brain judges
an individual...
... and categorizes him as to
whether he is intelligent or a crook.
lt's the king of human parts.
The characteristics of human brain
are amazing, aren't they?
Absolutely, it's very amazing.
We need to begin our project
on human brain within a week.
Shall we do a project on
an interesting patient?
Hey, see this one!
Hey, it's interesting, isn't it?
- Yes!
Who suggested the idea of taking
up this case for your project?
l suggested this idea, Sir!
- Did you read the file thoroughly?
lt's not only a peculiar case,
it is also a legal issue.
Please don't take up
this case for your project.
But it's an interesting case.
- Do as l say!
Else l may have to
inform your parents.
Alright, we will do
as you say...
... but please tell us
about the case in detail.
As medical students, let us
learn more about it. - Okay!
The patient's name
is Sanjay Ramasamy.
He was attacked by someone,
with an iron rod!
As a result he is suffering
from a loss of memory.
His brain has lost
the memory power.
This disease is termed as
Short Term Memory Loss.
He cannot retain anything in his
memory for more than 15 minutes.
lf he speaks to someone
for more than 15 minutes,...
... he forgets the beginning
of the conversation.
What about his friends
and acquaintances?
He forgets them within
a span of fifteen minutes.
He can remember only the
incident and the people he saw...
... during the course
of the incident.
Satisfying hunger pangs,
the language he used to speak,...
... the vehicle he used to drive,
are few actions...
... that have been registered
in his sub-conscious mind.
Hence, they are not
a problem for him.
ln fact, he is left handed and
he continues to be so.
What does he do when he wants
to go out or buy something?
Just as children memorize
their activities...
... this patient adopts
similar methods.
They need to write down their
itinary and put it into action.
l wonder what the poor soul,
who is struggling...
... to lead a normal life,
is upto at present.
Yes Sir! - Who was the first
to inform? - The watchman, Sir!
Hey, move!
He died just the way
Sethuraman died!
This is the second murder
within a span of one week.
l shall arrest him
within 24 hours!
Trace the culprit before the
police succeed in tracing him.
Take me to this lane!
Besent Nagar, 16th Cross Street.
This is your destination, Sir!
Go straight and turn right!
Go to Heritage Apartment.
This is the apartment
you were referring to.
Who lives here, Sir?
- l live here!
Excuse me, l live in this flat,
l have a problem...
l'm aware of your problem.
You suffer from loss of memory.
After all, l've been supplying you
lunch for the last one year.
Now, you want me to
guide you to the lift, right?
Go straight and take a turn
after the third block.
lt departed at 8.30 am. - l want to
show this ticket to the conductor.
Your good name?
This ticket was issued
at 10:00 am the day before,...
... from Besent Nagar to Adyar.
l see! Something's written
on the ticket.
He gave me a hundred rupee note,
but l didn't have change...
... so l made note of it
on the ticket,...
... but he seems to have
forgotten to collect the change.
l'm sure you'll remember
the man who forgot...
... to collect such a huge sum.
Please think hard.
Can you remember him?
How does he look?
ls he tall or short, fair or dark?
ls he stout or lean?
Think hard, l'm sure you
will recollect his personality.
l remember him vaguely!
The man is fair, but bald!
There is a scar on his head,
and he travels in my bus often!
Can you identify him in a crowd?
- Certainly!
He boarded my bus at the
Vannanthurai stop, at 10:00 am.
The time is 9:00 now. We need to
trap him within one hour. Hurry!
'Youth murdered'
'l vow to trace the culprit
within 24 hours'
You scoundrel! How dare you
take the police force for granted?
l'll get the better of you!
You rascal!
'My name is Sanjay,
Sanjay Ramasamy.'
My business is my hobby
and profession!
My father's aim was to be
the most successful man...
... in the cell phone industry.
lt was my aim too.
The city l loved most was Madras...
... my mother's birthplace.
This is Airvoice Mobile Company,
my office.
My father always advised me to
think big and work hard to achieve it.
lt was my aim to sell atleast
Five Crore Cell phones in Tamil Nadu.
Surprised?
l can make it possible.
There's barely any difference
between self-confidence and ego.
The phrase, 'l can do it'
reflects self-confidence...
... while the phrase,
'Only l can do it' reflects ego.
One can be successful not
by sheer hard work,...
... but only if one has
the will to do so.
Work is worship!
ln the midst of the lane,
landed a fairy
Will the celestial being

Look at her!
Ready, lights on, first take!
Shall we go for the first take?
Ready, action!
Ordinary soaps turn
your clothes pale...
Pan, action!
- ... but Ponmuthu soap...
Do you understand the
reason why l chose this soap?
Do you understand
why l chide her?
This is our 46th place, sir.
People will get a clear view
of our hoarding, if we fix it...
... on the terrace, as there is
a flyover adjacent to the building.
Who is staying here?
A girl named Kalpana!
Trace the girl and make arrangements
for fixing the hoarding at once!
What do you think of yourself?
You're only a co-artiste after all!
You'll be dismissed if
you continue to be late!
Get ready quickly!
Where is Kalpana Madam?
Call her Kalpana, that's it.
lntroduce yourself first!
l'm Secretary to the MD of
Airvoice Cell Phone Company.
l see! l'm the Director
of this Ad film.
l've directed several Ad films.
ln fact l directed the most popular
Ad film, Monkey brand bath soap.
Do you want me to
direct any Ad films?
Where is Kalpana madam?
Tell her that the MD of Airvoice,
Sanjay Ramasamy sent me here.
She is inside, perhaps.
Excuse me madam... - Yes.
We are from Airvoice.
Our MD sent us here to discuss
an important matter with you.
Simply open the door and serve
them tea. - As you command, Sir!
Sorry, don't try to convince me.
l can't help!
l'm not interested.
- Love matter, perhaps. - ls it?
We're pleading to you for our
MD's sake. Please think over it.
l'm not interested.
You may go!
Oh no!
They're coming!
Madam.. - Tell your MD
that Kalpana isn't interested.
Okay, but you can still keep
our company visiting card.
Okay... - Thank you.
Sorry sir... sorry...hold on for a minute..
.- Just a minute, madam.
Madam!?
l'm sorry for interfering
in your personal affairs.
We overheard your conversation!
Boy, get a chair for madam!
Let me narrate the tale to you.
The MD of Airvoice Cell company,...
... Sanjay Ramasamy happened
to see you somewhere.
He sent his men to convey
his love to you,...
... but you have declined the offer.
Am l correct, madam?
Right?
- Absolutely right!
Why did you decline his proposal?
- Look, no matter what the...
... status of a person is,
but the man should be...
... to our liking, isn't it?
You are fortunate to have
received a good offer.
lf only you accept it, it will add
to the goodwill of our company.
lt's a golden opportunity that God
has given you. Please accept it.
Please accept it. - Wait. Please
give me that visiting card, Madam.
Come on! l'll call him.
lt's ringing.
Here, speak to him.
l'm Kalpana here.
- Oh, the terrace girl?
But is it true that you aren't
the owner of the house?
You haven't even settled the dues in
the past 2 months. Put the phone down!
The whole office is trembling.
- Express your love, come on!
lnform your MD that l've
accepted his proposal.
Pure, glittering, 916 Hallmark Gold,
available only at Kalyan Jewellers.
What does sincerity mean?
- Sincerity means, Hamam.
Why did you take the trouble, Sir?
- lt's alright!
Why have you brought Apple juice?
l'm allergic to it.
Please have it one last time.
l won't serve this juice next time.
One person called Co-ordinator Kumar,
will come here in a while.
He isn't aware of your affair
with Sanjay Ramasamy.
He will be shocked if he hears of it.
We can bag a few Ad films from him...
... we need to progress, after all.
lt will improve your image,
isn't it?
Don't worry, sir. lf you trust
Kalpana you'll never be disappointed.
Thank you...
Thank you so much.
You may go!
Set the camera. - l'm a reporter
from Kungumam Magazine.
We're publishing an article on
the lives of female models...
... can you please arrange for
an interview with your models?
You may go and meet them
in the Make-up room.
Welcome, sir!
Please sit down.
The Director told me that
you'd come. - ls that so?
l've got to got the airport.
Sanjay is going to Bombay today.
Sanjay!?
Sanjay Ramasamy, the owner
of Airvoice Mobile Company.
He is my lover.
- ls he your lover?
Yes, of course! l met him for the
first time at the Bombay Airport.
He kept gazing at me,
and to my surprise,...
... his seat was next
to mine, on the flight.
He initiated the conversation,
and that's when...
... l learnt that he was
Sanjay Ramasamy.
May l note this down?
- By all means!
Thereafter, he called me repeatedly,
but l never showed any interest.
He insisted that we get married,
but l strongly declined his proposal.
ls it so?
Finally, l accepted his
proposal, out of sympathy.
'Kungumam - Love affair with
renowned businessman'
'Sensational revelations
by an Ad film model!'
'Of my God, is he the VlP?
Stunning remarks, Kalpana.'
'One sachet of Masala powder,
free with every magazine'
Hello... No... lt's a false news!
Come on... believe me...
l have not even seen her.
l have never met her before.
lt's a farce!
l don't understand why she said so.
l'll call you back later!
ls the girl's picture printed?
Neither her picture nor
yours is printed, sir!
l must meet that girl!
l'm not able to cross
the road, Miss!
What's the matter?
Careful! Slowly!
Place your foot on the gate.
Come, my dear!
You wait here!
Who's Kalpana here?
- She's upstairs!
You've finally succeeded.
l learnt of the truth only after
reading the magazine.
Congrats. - Thank you.
Bye!
Excuse me!
Yes...
ls your name Kalpana?
- Yes, it's me! What's the matter?
l read the article printed
in Kungumam magazine.
Oh no!l'm tired of these phones,SMS's,
photographs, autographs & interviews.
l kept this affair a secret all this
while only to avoid this publicity.
People are troubling me
unnecessarily.
Actually, l met him for the
first time at Bombay Airport.
He kept gazing at me,
and to my surprise,...
... his seat was next
to mine, on the flight.
l didn't know that he was none
other than Sanjay Ramasamy.
He greeted me and so did l!
He talked and talked until
we reached Chennai airport.
The moment we landed in Chennai,
he said that he loves me!
l refused to accept his love.
He tried every possible way...
... to convince me, and finally
l had to accept his love!
l've been flooded with
recommendation calls...
... ever since the article was
published in the magazine.
You too are here to act
in Ad films, right?
You're wearing a Coat, only
to act in this AD film, right?
Have they selected you?
Do you need my recommendation?
Don't expect to be selected for Suiting Ad
just because you're wearing this Coat.
You must be prepared
to act in any Ad film!
l shall recommend only if
you're truly talented!
Hold it.
That's a spatula!
Now repeat...
'Rupini is not the name of the cook,
it's the name of a cooking oil.Tell me.
l'll say it some other time.
- Fine, you seem to be shy!
Give me your phone number.
l'll call you when there's a chance!
Do you have an Airvoice Cell?
Why did you choose that?
lt has shown a bad performance!
lt's an useless cell phone!
They refuse to provide good
service to their customers!
lt's our company, yet it should
maintain a good standard, isn't it?
Hai Anitha... hold on...
You're Manohar, right?
Okay, l'm busy now...
... l shall call you whenever
there's a chance, bye!
Absolutely right!
l met him at the Bombay Airport,
he greeted me and so did l!
He talked continuously...
l've completed my MBA
at the Harvard's...
... l'll be looking after this
business after my Dad.
l feel honoured to be identified
as the lndian Entrepreneur of this year!
l strongly feel that Technology
has to reach the people beyond...
... the socio and
economic barriers.
And that's the goal of
my company! Sorry, one sec.!
l'm Kalpana speaking.
How are you? - Kalpana!? Who's that?
Sanjay Ramasamy's lover!
Oh! How are you?
- l'm fine.
Would you like to act
in a vest and brief Ad film?
Certainly! Are you acting
in that Ad too?
lt's a Gents' Ad that's the reason
l called you. Please come at once!
l'm at Saligramam,

Just a moment. Mark!
- Yes sir! - Tell me!

Hurry up! You must prove
your dignity, so take an auto.
You have enough money to pay
the auto, don't you? - Yes, madam!
lt's very hot in Chennai.
- You talk as though you're from USA.
Drive carefully, you rascal.
- Sorry!
You needn't apologize to them.
They need to learn to
walk on the footpath.
Stop!
- Please pay some extra amount.
Here, take this.
Hi! You seem to be shocked.
My manager, Mr. Kumar was looking
for a new model... so l thought of you.
Which Ad did you mention about?
- Sudarmani Briefs Ad.
lf only you're selected,
you'll be the luckiest man.
Just imagine, a Vinyl
Hoarding on Beach Road,...
... featuring you in a Briefs Ad.
Don't worry, you will
definitely be selected.
Do l have a chance in
any Ad other than this?
Yes, an Ad which features an ointment
used...for itching, ring worms, etc.
Oh no, l prefer the Ad
featuring briefs.
Hello sister!
- Hello!
You'd promised to recommend for
the Ad featuring briefs, didn't you?
Someone else has been
selected for that Ad.
l'll recommend you for
the ltch Guard Ad instead.
l'm afraid l cannot act in it.
You simply have to scratch your
thigh and you'll be selected.
l'll come in a moment.
- Which way do you want to go, sir?
l have to go to the bus stop.
- Please hold my hand.
l'll tell you about the
spots we pass by, okay?
Four young girls in their
uniforms, are standing here.
One lady is quarrelling
with her husband.
Some music is being played
at the tea stall.
The manhole is left open!
We're about to cross the

We've reached the main road now.

Good morning sir.
- Good morning.
Did you call for me? - Yes,
take your seat. - What's the matter?
You have made our company proud!
What!? - l have taken an important
decision without your permission.
Our company is going to have a
grand celebration on New Year's Eve.
You know who the Chief Guest is?
- Who is it, Sir?
None other than your lover and
MD of Airvoice Mobile, Sanjay Ramasamy.
lt's your responsibility
to convince him.
Look, l've even printed his name
on the invitation card.
Several people from the Media are
expected to attend this function.
Oh no! With whose permission did you
print his name as the Chief Guest?
Please don't say so.
We've invited everyone already.
You must convince him
to grace the occasion.
We're not on good terms now.
- Please don't say so.
Our guests will be spell bound on
seeing him, else my job will be at stake.
How could you print his name
without my permission?
l apologize for doing so.
Please pardon me.
You have committed a blunder.
- l admit my mistake...
... but please don't be
so stubborn.
No chance! - But we haven't
met him even once before.
We're all eager to see him, please
convince him to attend the function.
What did you say?
- We have never seen him.
Have you never seen him?
- Never!
Fine, l'll convince him.
Trust Kalpana and you'll
never be disappointed.
Say Hello...
Hello.. l'm Sanjay...
Sanjay Ramasamy. - Perfect!
You'll play Sanjay Ramasamy's
role at the party tomorrow.
You must prove yourself,
else people will get suspicious.
Hey, my friend is here.
You pose as Sanjay before him.
You will be selected if
he doesn't recognize you.
Ready?
Sanjay!?
- Sanjay's here, come in!
Hey Manohar, come here.
- Here? - Meet Mr.Sanjay!
Hai... l'm Sanjay.
What!? - Sanjay Ramasamy!
- Who!?
He is the one.
- Are you bluffing?
You fool!
While you're being introduced,
you must greet him...
... only after he greets you.
You have messed up everything.
Manohar, l'm going to disclose
a fact to you.. - What is it?
l don't love Sanjay Ramasamy.
- What!?
l have never met him before.
They thrust him on me, and
l was forced to accept it...
... as it was a prestige issue.
Now, they're hosting
a party on 31st night,...
... and they want me
to bring Sanjay there.
Hence l hired this man,
but you recognized him.
What should l do now?
- Relax! l'll train him.
Do you speak English? lt enhances
your looks when spoken in style.
Stop it! You are responsible
for this mess up.
Move forward.
Undo the knots!
You must walk with grace
and shake hands confidently.
Take off your Coat!
- l won't! - Do as l say!
Wear your spectacles!
Great! Hey, you must play Sanjay's
role at the party on 31st night.
What!? - Please don't refuse!
He will surely come, won't he?
- Certainly, sir!
Else my job will be at stake.
Sister! The Coat is ready. With your
permission, l'll dress in a jiffy...
... and introduce myself to
the crowd gathered here.
l promise to prove myself.
Get out of my sight!
Cheat! How dare he hire
such an expensive car?
l won't pay the price.
Please hold this. - Strange,
he has barely begun acting...
... and people have begun
to trust him already.
Excuse me sir... l just kept
her waiting...Once again...
Hai... hai darling! - Darling?!
l know l'm late!
You're looking so cute!
Hello sir! l'm Kalpana's director.
l am the one who compelled
her to love you.
Haven't you mentioned anything
to him? - l did mention.
Can l have your autograph please?
- Oh sure!
l read the article that was printed
in the Economic Times, last week.
You're really excellent.
- Thank you.
You may proceed for dinner!
Please come, sir!
l can't believe it.
- Why do you say so?
l'm shocked to see such
an affluent man at our party.
Our clients in Bombay
will be bewildered!
Can you replace this drink
with a chilled drink?
You deserve only this!
lt's okay!
He's acting too smart.
- Okay, you may go!
l'm the Chief of a Women's
Rehabilitation Centre.
We're collecting funds
for our organisation.
Can you contribute anything
towards our fund?
He isn't carrying any cash.
- We accept cheques too.
l don't think he is carrying
a cheque book either.
Why are you acting smart?
Who asked you to carry a cheque book?
You'll be trapped!
Have you gone crazy?
Thank you sir.
- My best wishes.
Wear your spectacles!
Each one of them believed
that you are Sanjay Ramasamy.
Foolish people! Right?
Foolish people!
That man read an article about you
in the Economic Times!
l love you! - What?
l love you and wish
to marry you.
Why all of a sudden?
- l just felt so!
l never experienced
such a feeling.
So, l'm confused!
l need some time to
think about it.
Can l reply to you
in the morning? - Okay!
But you mustn't mistake me
if l reject you, okay?
l've got to go.
See you tomorrow, bye!
Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.
l didn't disclose
my true identity as...
... l wanted to win her heart
as an ordinary man.
l shall reveal my identity
if she accepts me.
Else l shall part ways
with her as Manohar.
My fate will be decided at dawn!
This is the last page and
the last date of the year too.
The New year 2003 begins
the next day.
What happened the next day?
Did the girl confess her love?
What happened after that?
What happened to the girl?
Why are you in such
a miserable state?
Good morning sir.
Who are you?

Your doctor...
He is our Auditor. - Hello sir.
The Audit Reports and Annual Reports
of our company are ready.

l need your signatures on them.
Mr. Sanjay, how do you feel?
You need adequate rest, perhaps.
- You needn't come to office...
... but you can visit
your bungalow atleast.
Why don't you move out
of this small flat?
Please permit me to arrange
for a driver and a nurse...
... to care for you atleast.
l need only myself
and no one else!
Sorry.
Hello sir. l'm Chitra.

Can we chat for a while?
As a medical student l'm

of fifteen minutes!
lt reminds me that
l'm carrying a camera.
l use the camera to take
pictures of the people...

Our Prof. told us that

... that occurred
during the incident.
Do you remember how you
were assaulted?
Do you remember who assaulted you?
Yes.- How? What happened?
l can confide in you only when
we get close to one another.
Sorry... sorry, sir!
Please don't mistake me.
l wish to meet you again.
lf you could take my picture...
... l needn't introduce myself
all over again. Please.
Take one more, sir! One copy
for you and the other for me.
Write 'My Friend' on the photo.
Show me this photo
when we meet next time.
Okay sir. Thank you.
What are you doing here, sir?
Our college cultural programme
is going on upstairs.
Oh, sorry!
You don't remember me, isn't it?
Actually you know me.
l forgot to bring that photo.
Our Prof. refused to permit us
to do a project on a patient...
... saying that some police case
is involved in it, right?
He is the patient.
Sir, we met that day.
Have you forgotten about it?
Sir, l've a programme.
You must come.
Please come as soon as possible.

l'm like a crossword puzzle
which you have to solve!
You pierce my heart
gently like an arrow.
The wind will caress me
and adorn fragrance!
The string of flowers too
will whisper in my ears!
My lips influence a poet's verses!
Every channel on radio,
will speak about you!
Your beauty is bewitching!
Thousands will swoon over you!
Your fans will hover around you!
Hey, who's that?
What are you up to,
standing beside the car?
Hey, what happened?
Answer me!
Who's the culprit?
- Sir, you were actually his target.
Who is he?
Two years ago...
- Speak up!
... we were on a trip..
- Hey, speak up! Who's that man?
Hey, speak up! Who's that man?
What's his name? Answer me!
Tell me his name atleast.
Who is he?
Tell me his name atleast!
Boss, he is dead!
Get me a copy of our crime record
we committed two years ago...
... l also need to know on whose
hit list l appear! lt's urgent!
You don't care for me any longer..
Can you guide me to
Sanjay Ramasamy's flat?
Go to the second floor!
Hurry, release me!
Get out of this place. He is a
murderer. Do as l say! Hurry!
Who are you? Tell me!
No..
No problem...
Let's go! - You..?
- Have you forgotten so soon?
Look, the picture you'd taken,
with 'My Friend' marked on it.
l had to make an urgent call,
so l came here. Let's go!
Did l chase you? - Not at all!
Why should you chase me?
l'm your friend after all.
l did chase you. l'm panting
and so are you.
l'm perspiring and so are you.
l certainly chased you!
Hey, don't you know that smoking
is prohibited in a public place?
You said that you'd thrash people if
they smoked in public, didn't you?
Come on, thrash them now!
What!? Did you dare to
say that you'd beat us?
Beat us if you dare to!
Come on!
Beat us if you dare to!
Come on!
Beat us if you dare to!
Spare me!
Listen to me Lakshman!
l never interfered in your affairs
during the last four years, did l?
Why did you attempt
to kill me then?
l wasn't the one!
- l'm not sure whether it was you.
But l've decided to
rout my enemies.
You can't escape after killing me.
l too have high level contacts.
Kill each one of them!
We have killed all our enemies,
why do you appear to be tense yet?
lt's none of these people.
We have left out one of them.
These men trembled
on just hearing my name.
The culprit is someone else.
We have missed one of them.
Trace him!
He is tense, you can't
meet him now.
l need to talk to him urgently.
lmpossible, you may come later.
- His life is at stake.
Someone's hatched a plot
to kill him.
l can hear a girl's voice,
call her in.
Sir, l'm Chitra. l visited a
patients' home unexpectedly...
The patient has hatched
a plot to kill you.
l found pictures of two men
he had killed already.
This is your picture. He has marked
the date of your murder on it.
l wanted to inform
the police, but...
... it would spoil the
reputation of our college.
lt would affect my studies too.
But l couldn't ignore it either.
Hence l thought it was apt
to warn you personally.
One minute.
This is his picture.
One who's suffering from a memory loss,
has planned to kill me.
He has even fixed the
date for killing me!
l'll fix the time for him.
Such a man will cease to exist...
... within the next 12 hours.
Be alert! He has gone out.
He will surely pass by us.
Shoot him if he comes your way.
l'll gun him down,
if he comes my way.
This picture was taken by him.
Will the police interrogate me...
... if they trap that man?
You should have thought of it
before befriending him.
You have invited trouble
for yourself now!
