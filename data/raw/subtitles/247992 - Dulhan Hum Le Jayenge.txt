Madam, your tea.
What're you thinking about?
- Nothing.
But surely, it's something?
You've been thinking for so long.
I've been thinking about
this for some time.
God has given me such a
wonderful son.
I wish I had a daughter too.
The music of her bangles would've
filled the emptiness in this house
A daughter is very necessary
for a mother.
Necessary! That's what I told you
twenty years ago.
And what did you say?
Forget. Raja is still so young.
Had you agreed then, Raja would've
had 4 or maybe 5 siblings.
How about getting Raja married?
We'd get a readymade daughter.
What if instead of being daughter
she treats you as mother-in-law?
Loss of peace! God forbid.
I've a girl in mind, just
the type you'd like.
Who's she?
- Her name is Sapna.
Before I came to work for you,
I was working in her house.
You miss a daughter -
And she misses her parents.
She has no parents?
Then who brought her up?
- Her uncles. Bhola Nath,
Vicky Nath and Prabhu Nath.
Oh my mind
Why do you worry?''
Krishna will do
What He likes''
Like Meera Bai, she receives a
dose of religious every morning.
Enough uncle, I did 2 kilometers.
- Two more to go.
But uncle, I'm tired! Please.
- So soon?
You're a man. I'm a girl!
How can I jog four kilometers?
Remember our sprinter P.T. Usha?
She could outrun me.
The modern woman should be
strong and active.
So, when necessary, she should be
able to put up a fight.
Health is most important.
You relax. I'll be back.
Ogling at the girl? That's why you
need spectacles at this age?
Lie down. Pick this up.
Start practicing 400 times.
Hey Mr. Muscleman,
why do you beat him?
I'll gouge out the eyes of any one
who ogles at my niece.
You know only bodybuilding.
There's a young girl in the house.
How can you stop boys from ogling?
They may ogle at someone else.
Not Bhola's niece.
Come dear. Two kilometers more.
- Uncle pleas...
Will you make her dance forever?
How about taking her out?
Give her a chance to dance with
someone young, man.
Had I a say, I'd never let brother
priest and wrestler come near you.
Khan, is breakfast ready?
- Coming up, sir.
Good God! All my life I've been
seeing you eat these carcasses.
Pandit ji, my breakfast please.
- Coming up, sir.
Asses eat grass and hay. Lions eat
meat. I say, you too eat non-veg.
Vegetarian food is the fare for
peace of body, mind and soul.
John, bring my continental food.
You three are concerned
about your own food.
Did you ask if Sapna baby
has eaten or not!
Hasn't Sapna eaten yet?
Sapna hasn't eaten yet?
Lf Sapna hasn't eaten
how will I eat?
Why are you asking me?
Go and ask her.
What's the matter?
Why haven't you eaten?
What is the matter?
What can I eat?
Lf I don't eat veggies,
you'll mind it.
If I don't eat non-veg,
then you'll mind it.
And if I don't eat continental,
you'll mind.
How can I eat what all three of
you want me to eat?
But you don't know what's
good for your health.
Refined butter is good for bones.
We're concerned about your health.
- Continental is best for health.
I don't care about health.
I want to eat what I like.
I can't eat what I want.
I can't go where I want to go.
I can't do anything I want.
Do I've a choice or not?
Of course darling, your choice
is all-important, but...
I won't hear a thing!
Please go away.
You're the elder, you leave first.
- You're younger, You let me talk.
I said all of you go away.
What's come over our Sapna?
Not that I understand.
We love her so much.
She doesn't need your love.
- Then?
When will you realize that
baby is now a grown-up woman?
She needs a man's love. Her
husband's love. Not uncles' love.
She's right. Sapna has grown up
She ought to be married off.
I've decided that I'll look for
a boy for our Sapna darling.
What?
A bit delicate, somewhat normal,
little intelligent. Just like me.
Do you want to ruin her life?
You're giving me shivers! Look at
you! Who wants someone like you?
What am I like?
I'm going to choose the boy.
Someone who's religious.
Who goes to the temple.
Who is devoted.
Life isn't all about religion and
eating radish. I'll get the boy.
Someone who's strong in mind and
body. Who can take on fifty.
My uncles want me to marry.
- Don't you want to marry?
I will. But kind of boys they're
out to find will ruin my life.
All my life I've danced
to their tunes.
After marriage my husband will
want me dance to his tune.
You want to marry a boy of
your choice, isn't it?
That comes later. First...
I want to live my life.
The way I like. Of my own choice.
There is only one you can do it.
Run away from here.
What are you saying?
Yes. Else, your mad uncles won't
let you live the life you want.
How dare you?
- You're dismissed.
They threw me out. But I've never
been able to forget Sapna.
There's only one thing I stole
from that house. Sapna's photo.
I always keep it close to me.
Take a look.
So beautiful!
She's the one I want for my son.
She's top qualifies. From one
uncle, she has imbibed religion.
Another uncle has made her
health conscious.
The third has made her up-to-date.
She moves with the times.
How do you like the photo?
- She is a wonderful kid.
We have decided.
We want her for your wife.
Her photo is pretty her presence
will light up our home.
Why don't you speak?
- I'll help him decide.
Come on a boxing bout.
If you win, she'll be your wife.
If I lose...
Hey, you hit me!
Then, she will become your
daughter-in-law.
First of all, who gave
you our address?
Who told you that we have
a young girl in this house.
And that we are thinking
about her marriage?
A marriageable girl of good
character needs no promotion.
Proposals start pouring in
automatically.
It would be very kind of you if
you'll show me the girl.
What? Show her?
She is our daughter.
Not a merchandize for sale.
I too want to make her my
daughter-n-law.
Per force?
Who are you?
I'm Seth Oberoi.
Seth Oberoi! He talks as if he's
the one who owns Oberoi Hotels.
Does your son know disco dancing
and fashion designing?
Does he know wrestling?
Is he tough. Can he fight?
How about rituals. Can he recite
Ramayan, Geeta, and Mahabharat?
What nonsensical questions?
I'm here for a marital alliance.
This one asks whether my son
can jive in discos.
He asks if my son is a wrestler.
The third wants him to recite
Ramayan and Mahabharat slokas.
Is this a home or madhouse?
Marriage can't take place if boy
doesn't have these qualifications.
Then I won't have alliance in
family of lunatics.
The door is behind you.
I know.
- That isn't a window, it's door.
Sapna dear!
- Yes!
Don't touch.
- That way.
Who was he, uncle.
Damn them! They insulted me.
As if my son is a criminal.
What did they say?
- What more they could say.
Threw me out! Showed me to the
door. Said: ''Get out.''
They said that to you?
- Hold on.
I was angry too.
I wanted to break their jaws.
But one look at Sapna -
and I cooled down.
Is She so good.
- Lot better than she told.
She's exquisite!
- But they insulted you?
So what?
- What do you mean?
I'm not going to spare them.
I'm more obstinate than you are.
And if you're my son, then you'll
do what I want. You'll marry Sapna
Is that so important for you dad?
- Very important.
Then its even more important
for me. Because of you.
We'll bring the bride home!
Where are you going?
Uncle, I'm not going to do
something wrong.
For a while, I want to live
the way I want.
I want to go where I like.
I want to breathe the free air.
Please uncle, let me go!
I'll surely come back.
How much cash are you carrying?
Not a cent. You can check my bag.
Trying to go around the world
without a cent?
My brothers are lunatics.
But I'm sophisticated, delicate...
educated and emotional. I can
understand your pain very well.
What're you doing?
Bholu! Prabhu! She's run away!
Both of you forced Sapna
to run away.
What're you saying?
- Where is Sapna gone?
Read this letter. It says she's
leaving to live in her own way.
The wrestler! You made her leave.
- I will slap you.
Where has she gone?
- You made her jog day and night.
You made a sprinter like P.T. Usha
Now she wont ever come back!
No! Sapna couldn't run!
- Couldn't? She's run away.
Now who'll do your rituals?
- Don't make me move.
Go and look for her. She must have
gone to her girlfriend's home.
Girlfriend's home? You didn't
allow her to make friends.
Oh Lord! Protect her. She's young.
Let her not tread the wrong path.
Now where do we look for her?
You go to the railway station
you to the bus stand...
And I'm going to the airport.
You know I too was excited on my
first trip to Paris by Air India.
I'd saved dollars.
You keep this.
I've fixed you with a group tour.
You'll go and come back with them.
You'll be safe with them. I'm
afraid to send you alone.
Now tell me. Am I not better
than your other two uncles?
What happened?
- Where is the tour manager?
You call him.
Everybody is asking - my ticket
my boarding card, my passport...
Where're you? A the ration shop?
Asking for sugar, wheat, rice?
This is an airport and it
deserves some dignity.
I'm your tour manager!
Not a handyman at the ration shop.
One girl is missing.
- She is here.
Are you a girl?
- Shut up. Mind your manners.
You want me to take you
in place of a girl.
And in the name of Sapna ( dream )!
Sapna is my niece.
- Will you travel on her alias?
I'm a fashion designer.
I've traveled all over world.
So you both want to travel
on ticket for one.
What do you think this is?
A bus or train? This is a plane.
I'm her uncle, she's my niece!
I'm here to see her off.
Then go. Do you want to go up to
airplane or meet the pilot?
Check the plane?
Go and get you checked.
Okay uncle, I'll go now.
Make sure to stay with the group.
- Nothing will happen to me.
Tell me one thing, Mr. Kodak.
All heroines shoot in Bombay
Why are you shooting my
portfolio on the Switzerland?
You don't understand, Ms. Lovely!
Producer gets the location free.
What's going on?
- Haven't you eyes? Can't you see?
I've eyes, but you're blind.
- Why?
Don't you know photography in
airplane is prohibited.
Where is it written?
- Whom have you been shooting?
Cant you see? Her.
- Her?
You're a picture from head to toe.
Why do you want to be photographed
Excuse me, she's with me.
- All of you're with me.
Sit down.
- You take it easy, lady.
No. Don't. Put on your seat belt.
Perhaps he needs a belt at home.
What's this mischief.
- Are you looking for 4A?
This is 4A.
- Then this is my seat.
This is my seat too.
- You expect me to sit on your lap?
I can sit on your lap. But it'll
be difficult. Rather you sit.
Why don't you understand?
- What's going on.
He's sitting on my seat. Look
Two boarding on the same seat!
How did they make such a mistake?
What a delightful mistake!
Please take that seat.
- Why? I'll sit here, on my seat.
Please move over.
Are you going to beat me?
- Why should I get up?
I took this seat first.
Never seen such a persistent boy.
- Nor will you ever.
We're going to be together for
sometime. Keep seeing me.
Lots of cops.
It's going to be tough
getting the stuff out.
We can't take out, but look...
There is a group of Indians.
They'll take it out for us.
What are you up to?
Scream and shout so the cops
will come and take you.
That way we'll be able to enjoy
our tour in peace.
He is making me miserable.
The police inspector is here.
That's God answering my prayers.
Sapna must have been found.
I called him.
So, you filed a report about
the runaway girl.
Did you find anything?
- First, let me find from you.
Who has she eloped with?
- What do you mean by eloped?
She isn't eloping type.
- How old is she?
Nineteen.
- Color?
I gave you a photo.
- Even I look fair in photos.
Fair, with brown eyes.
- She's like a child to us.
How many boyfriends did
this child have?
None.
- Is she in college?
Strange! Goes to college -
and has no boy friends?
How many girlfriends?
- None.
What about her habits?
- What do you mean by habits?
Stuff in campuses these days -
Hashish? Alcohol? Drugs?
Hold this for me.
Now ask. What was your question?
Enough to say no.
Is she an outdoors type?
No.
- Good, that she ran away.
What do you mean?
- I mean, no boy or girl friends...
What else could she
except run away.
She hasn't come yet.
- Who?
The Empress!
- You mean queen of India?
Did you wake her up?
She screamed so much that
my heart is still pounding.
Get on the bus.
I'll get her.
Hey, the queen of India. Wake up.
- Let me sleep.
A busload is waiting for you.
Up and out.
Come on, I'm on a holiday.
- Keep these tantrums for home.
I said, I want to sleep.
- I feel sleepy too.
What happened?
Come to bed. With me.
Everybody out.
Friends, this is the capital of
Switzerland - Bern.
We'll halt here for two hours.
Go shop, eat or whatever you want.
We'll meet near the clock tower.
And you won't be late.
Come, Ms. Lovely, let's shoot.
Why are you tailing me?
My I ask, why you're tailing me?
What do you want?
Why are you after me?
Why are you playing hard to get.
How about saying it with love?
I can. But I don't want. Because
I don't think it's necessary.
It has been 31/2 hours.
And she isn't back yet.
You know her?
- No. I want to know her for life.
There she comes!
- Is she the same girl?
What she was... and what she is!
Walk slowly, without coquetry
You're sixteen, what a rhythm!''
But turn back and look
Boy is wonderful too.''
Boy is wonderful.
Do you know how late you are?
I wasn't trying to kiss.
I wanted to whistle.
You look great, today.
- Is that so?
Turn.
Hi, Queen of India!
- Yes, go on.
A busload of us waiting for you.
- Tell them, I'm sleeping.
If you don't come down
by the count of three...
I'll assume that you want
me to come over...
One... two... and three...
Stupid boy.
What happened?
They've left for Austria.
- What do we do now?
So friends. You saw Switzerland
and saw the beautiful scenarios.
You also saw Swiss Bank - where
world deposits the black money.
You saw their mansion like pigstys
- our mansions look like pigstys.
Anyway, we're on our way from
Switzerland to Austria.
And I see that my advise is
finally being heeded to...
Some people are coming closer...
like sheep to the slaughter.
What a girl! All she does is
sleep. Look at this.
Why didn't you wake me up?
I must've been sleeping on your
shoulder for hours.
Lucky! Do you know how many girls
die for a nap on my shoulder.
Hey, there's McDonald. Stop!
This isn't India. Lots of
McDonald's here.
I know. You made me sit in bus
without breakfast! I'm so hungry.
How about eating me?
Then tolerate the appetite like
I've been tolerating you.
Enough of your wise cracks.
Splat on my lap again!
Sometime you barge in my room,
then you sleep on my shoulder.
Seems you're taking quite
an interest in me.
Say folks, what do you think?
- She's interested.
I'm not that type of girl!
- What type are you?
Typify, please.
- Yes, what type?
You're pulling my leg a
bit too hard.
Come on do whatever you've to do...
but do it fast.
Get back before the
tank is filled.
Let me get something
from McDonald's.
McDonald is very far.
Buy something here.
No! All this is trash!
I want that stuff.
Wait for me.
Is this girl stupid? How come her
parents let her come alone?
They've kicked her out.
So you can take care of her
Where is the bus?
- Gone. You?
I tried to explain that she is
Queen of India
She'll buy you out -
bus and all. But he left.
Don't try to tell me that you
missed the bus for my sake.
Why not, I'm the loony who loves
hanging around gas stations.
Obviously, I'm waiting
here for you.
And I've their number in Australia
- Show me.
Now you go your way, I'll go mine.
I don't like your company.
What happened to him?
These whites run fast.
- Are you talking to the wind?
You never got the wind?
- What?
The man I ran after,
stole your purse.
My bag has been stolen.
Where is my bag?
Good bye. I'm going to Austria.
Alone. I don't like your company.
What kind of guy are you? Will you
ditch an Indian girl in distress?
Are you asking for my help?
What kind of man are you? Will you
ditch an Indian girl in distress?
We'll get another bus
10 kilometers from here.
Yes, let's go.
What?
- Yes, let's go.
Don't try to fool me.
Where's that girl?
Are you Indian?
- Yes. So?
An Indian brother shoves a gun on
his elder brother's ear?
You should be ashamed!
You're my brother! Not a hoodlum.
Are you a hoodlum?
- Why are you hitting me?
Little brothers should be playing
with toys! Not guns!
You are a goon!
- Don't you...
I'm tired! I can't walk any more.
- Bus station is close. Come.
I won't go anywhere
without transport.
Should I call a limo for you?
Chauffeur holding a door saying...
Queen of India, please step in.
We can get a lift.
If it's that easy, every pauper
would've gone around the world.
I know how to get left.
- Then go get it.
What type of boy will give lift?
- I'll get it!
Indians like you give a bad name
to India. Back out. Let her go.
Something missing?
Exercising doesn't make
you fighter.
What now? Didn't I win?
Will you give us a lift?
- No.
One minute mother. Put this on.
And this for you, brother.
What's going on?
- Come on.
You look nice in borrowed clothes.
- I'll buy you a new set in India.
It's not Indian - it's imported.
Go to your room.
This is my room.
- Where is mine?
I'll let you stay here.
- What?
Are you telling me to stay here?
Do you expect me to stay with you?
I don't have money for
separate rooms.
Whether you stay or not.
This is the only room.
What'll my boyfriend think if he
finds I spent a night with a boy?
Lf my girlfriend gets to know,
she will ditch me.
What're you doing.
Calling my boyfriend in India.
India? I let you wear my suit and
you are out to strip me?
I'll pay you back in India.
Why did you cancel your ticket?
Others on this group are
so boring, so irritating...
Why did you disconnect my line?
You romance off on my expense
and you call me names?
Now, whom are you calling?
- My girlfriend.
Hi love! What're you doing?
Why did you disconnect?
- Because you disconnected mine?
Good you came by.
Can you lend me Fr 3?
Sure, but for what?
I drank a little beer.
Got to pay him.
Sapna, let me tell you
something frankly.
I've lots of francs to lend to
you. But none for this beer.
Why?
Are you French?
- No.
British? German? Russian?
- No!
I'm Indian.
- Is that how Indian girls behave?
Is this how Indian boys behave?
Here's a girl being molested and
all you do is apologize.
Couldn't you beat them up?
Lf a girl seduces a boy he'll
most likely do this.
But I was just dancing.
What do you want?
Should I go and beat them up?
Are you French? Italian?
- No.
German? Russian?
- No. I'm Indian.
So, then.
But, it was all your mistake.
Oh Mr. Raja, come back.
I blundered please forgive me''
Raja, you're vain!
You won't say yes.
Sure? Sure, you won't forgive?
Okay. I'll sit here all night.
Come after I'm kidnapped.
Don't say, I didn't warn you.
You won't agree? Final?
- Do what you like. No more drama.
All right! Come after I'm dead.
I'll kill myself.
You've come back, haven't you?
Suit yourself. Don't talk.
Sapna, what childishness?
Who do I talk to? The hills?
Get up! Are you out of your mind?
How does it matter to you,
if I'm dead?
A least, I won't bother you.
Let's go.
- I won't come.
You're my life, you're my desire
You're the only one I love.''
But you're little bit crazy
The train to Austria is coming.
I will dump you with your group.
End of my responsibility.
Forgive me.
What?
- Are you angry with me?
No! I'm happy with you.
What were you up to yesterday?
I've never done that before.
You have a boyfriend, haven't you?
What if he gets to know?
I made a mistake.
Listen...
- What?
You weren't even drunk.
- I got carried away, I regret it.
Listen... give me a coin.
- Why?
I want to talk to him.
- No! Don't tell him anything.
Nothing happened.
- I just want to talk to him.
Is he in Switzerland?
- No.
Then use this card to talk.
- Does it have a balance?
Don't exhaust the card. I have to
talk to my girlfriend too.
I'm not with the group,
I got separated form them.
What! You suspect me.
Don't you raise your voice.
What! You're going to give me up?
I'm giving you up right now.
Didn't I tell you, not to talk to
him? Things went sour. Right!
Now hear my girlfriend out.
See how sweet she is!
With the group.
What! Who've you been talking to?
He is lying! I'm with the group.
There is no one there with me.
I'm alone. No one is laughing.
Was that laughing necessary?
Stop it.
Won't you ask any thing about me?
- I know every thing.
It's written all over your face.
Your parents are no more.
You have three uncles.
You like one of them.
He's the one who sent you here.
Let me tell you something.
The next man in your life...
not that idiot...
He'll make you happy.
Because he will love
you very much.
Leave me.
Raja! Help me.
Stop.
- Where is Sapna?
They have kidnapped her.
- My goodness! Get in the car.
Are they the same goons
who were looking for her?
Tell me where's you purse?
- Why you're after my purse?
My diamonds are in it.
Worth 70 million.
70 million worth of diamonds in my
purse! What are you talking about?
I hid those diamonds in your purse
at Zurich airport checkout.
You dropped in my purse!
Worth 70 million!
Why are you laughing?
- Because my purse was stolen.
The thief has made it! He needn't
have to do anything all his life.
I'll tell you. Not you, her.
In your ear.
Stop the car.
- That's her scream.
If you are trying to fool us,
you never see India again.
Understood?
Raja! Come on bash them up.
They told you that she has gone to
to the airport, didn't they?
Here, I've got them for you.
Move...
Who are you?
- And who the hell are you?
In these parts, I'm a heavyweight.
- I'm lightweight.
What are you doing here?
- I took a contract to kill her.
First you recover your diamonds.
Then I'll kill her.
Raja!
Not Raja, Teja, Indian police is
looking for me for a decade.
Raja, I never expected you to
turn out like this.
Am I mad? I've been baby sitting
her, and paying her hotel bills.
I'd stake my life for her!
- Then you'll lose it.
Who are you trying to fool?
Here's someone who does it right
under the nose of those whites...
how big a scoundrel he must be!
- What did you say?
I just called you a scoundrel.
- Whom did you call that?
You.
- You called me scoundrel?
You talk too much!
- Words of praise aren't enough.
Who are you calling a scoundrel?
Why not call a scoundrel a
scoundrel? I'm just praising you.
Praising me?
Don't you move.
Do just as I say.
Drop that hand look here.
Step aside.
We're leaving.
One minute.
- What happened?
She slapped me.
Don't mess with her! She knows
karate! She hit me too.
And I'm a wrestlers niece.
I'll fix you. Come on.
Your tour was better than ours was.
Thrilling, and action-packed.
Did the trill help the romance?
Everyone here seems to be
falling in love.
That makes for twin sharing.
Before we were renting 14 rooms.
Now I do with half.
Taking only 8 rooms! Very good!
But half of 14 is 7.
- She isn't going anywhere yet.
I'm not going anywhere.
How many rooms for you?
- As for now, two.
Still two!
Sapna. What happened?
When I asked you for two;
you insisted on one.
Why separate rooms now?
Are you American?
- No.
Russian? French? German?
- No. I'm Indian.
Never forget! Being a boy, I have
not forgotten. How could you?
Sharing a room when you have no
options is something else.
Hod your boyfriend feel if he
finds you shared room with a boy.
Same as your girlfriend
would've felt.
If you have a girlfriend; why did
you get too close to me?
Lf you have a boyfriend; why did
you get too close to me?
I've no boyfriend.
- I've no girlfriend.
You're lying!
- No! It's true. You're lying!
I'm telling the truth too.
Is there no one?
Is there no one?
- No.
True!
True!
- True.
Had you told me before, we'd have
been in the thick of it by now.
Tell me. Would you say it first?
Or should I?
Should I say it?
- Say it.
But if you say it first,
I'll be very happy.
We're asking about our niece!
Do you've any news or not?
Why are you laughing?
- You're unnerved in one week?
Nieces run away all the time!
Turn around, and look over there.
That closet is full of
runaway nieces!
After we've found them we'll start
looking for your niece.
Who inducts people like him in
the police force?
Don't be amazed. If I get news of
your niece, I'll call you.
If You get news of your niece,
you call me.
Hello Uncle, can you hear me?
- Where are you calling form?
I'm all right.
They must be fighting again.
You didn't even let us
talk with Sapna! Bash him up!
I was about to ask her address!
You dropped the phone.
Police arrest who fight outside.
Why do you fight in police station
Because of your harsh behavior she
has run away alone...
someday, she's going to
elope with some boy.
Then I'll shoot that boy.
Shoot him!
- Don't you laugh.
It's our private affair.
- Private affair!
You're home
I don't feel like it.
- Not that I feel like it either.
Hey! Get your hands off
our daughter.
What are you staring at?
Get lost.
Move on. Get lost.
Hey, didn't you hear?
Get out of here.
Get Out! And don't show
you face again.
Ever since she has gone missing,
I've stopped my workouts.
And you're still hooked to music?
Aren't you concerned?
Lord! Send my niece back to me.
Uncle.
See? That's the Miracle of prayer!
We can hear her voice!
Lord! Bring her back in person.
It isn't dream. She's real.
Uncle!
- Welcome.
Where'd you been? We were worried!
We're looking for you all over.
Had I told you, you won't
have allowed me to go!
But where have you been?
I went all around the world.
I saw Switzerland, Austria...
I had so much fun.
You never saw the neighborhood how
did you go to all these places?
Look at her. She went as Sita -
and has come back as Suzie.
Now she looks like a woman.
When Sapna walks, heads will turn.
Hey, that's in bad taste.
If you were not my brother,
I would've broken your face.
What else can a wrestler do?
Let me get my hands on you.
- No! Don't hit me.
It's so amusing when you fight.
Come on, I've brought lots of
presents for all of you.
Mother...
- Raja! You are home!
The house was feeling
so empty without you.
There are only three of us
in the family.
With you gone,
only two of us are here.
I'd gone to make foursome.
Which means son, you liked Sapna!
- Yes, but little less than you!
Have you done the job?
You are asking as if I went
for some business deal.
That's biggest deal of my life.
Have you done it or not?
What?
Are you going to get me bashed up?
- What? I'm asking what?
Did you propose to Sapna?
- Yes.
Did she agree?
- Agreed.
Then why don't you say so?
Come on! Let's hug.
Later. When she'll come home?
- Very soon ma.
Bring Sapna soon.
- But when are you introducing me?
Never. Because you look a bit
too much interested.
Mummy, isn't he over-eager?
- I suppose so.
She is your daughter-in-law.
- But that's my only interest.
Are you speaking the truth?
They are your stepparents?
You think I am lying?
- God help me.
I am really scared.
- Here comes stepmother.
Mother...
- What are you doing?
I'll do whatever you tell me to
do. But don't be harsh with Raja!
You don't know how nice he is.
I'll sweep the floor, do the
dishes, I'll do everything.
Please, don't burn me alive!
I'm afraid of burring to death.
What nonsense you are saying?
Let me explain.
- Put that on.
No! Please don't hit him!
We'll do as you say.
Shut up! One punch and
I'll break your teeth too.
Put it on.
Enough Daddy! All my life I've put
up your bullying!
But I can't tolerate you
bullying my fiancee!
Save Raja! These are his
stepparents. They torture him!
What are you saying?
- They are his real parents.
My child! You made her cry!
Naughty boy.
How could I live without you?
I came to work in this house so
you will come to live her forever.
Don't you recognized my? I was at
your house, the other day.
Your uncles threw me out.
- You!
Yes, so I sent Raja to
Europe after you.
Liar! Fraud! Cheat! ''I have
stepparents. They torture me.''
I'm not talking to a fraud again.
- Listen to me
I don't want to hear anything.
You knew all about me, and the
whole family was in it.
And they sent you after me.
Because they wanted you for a
daughter-in-law.
You had the money and still you
booked only one room.
Just to get close to me.
You wanted to marry me?
I wanted to, I want to and I will!
They have come here too!
I can take on that boy, but girl
is dangerous. You handle her.
Look, I told you, your diamonds
aren't with me...
On one condition.
You will have to marry him.
What!
He's my cousin and his girlfriend.
Both live in Europe.
I took that beating for his love!
- And I took the slap!
Don't tell me you've
forgotten you friend?
He too!
He's my childhood friend, Mandy.
You're forgetting something.
- What?
My purse. I'm sure that thief too
was in league with you.
Not mine. His man, talk to him.
Please give my purse back.
It's my favorite purse.
After all there are diamonds,
worth 70 million in it.
On one condition.
Will you marry Raja.
Sapna, I did all that, so I could
get you. You aren't angry?
We stayed in one room,
but I never touched you.
Why didn't you!
Love is the festival of hearts
Love is the festival of hearts
So, why is anybody alone.''
How could you fall in love without
asking me first?
I was hoping you'd find
someone like me.
Now, don't be cross, uncle.
You'll like him the
moment you see him.
You know he helped me in Europe.
My bag's stolen he paid all bills.
Yes, that means he impressed
you with money.
He is a perfect gentleman.
We shared same room and he
didn't ever touched me.
He must be a real idiot. But I
won't consent because you praise.
Just meet him once. He is so
handsome! What a body!
And he dances so well!
He sings too.
Like me!
- Yes uncle, just like you!
That one with long hair?
- No! One over there!
Uncle your niece is an
Antique piece! 362436
She is the one I love most...
Let me have her hand please...
Where's she gone?
- Its nearly ten.
She never stays out so late.
Listen, Sapna is missing!
- I sent her for an outing.
Outing! Where?
I've chosen a boy for her.
So I sent them out, so that...
they'll get to know each other.
- Take this.
I haven't ever sent her for outing
with a girlfriend in day time...
and you sent her out with a boy at
night! I'm going to kill you.
Won't you get her married?
- Not with the boy you like.
Save my child God! Who knows which
whom this devil has sent her.
I'll fix him afterwards. First,
I'm going to look for Sapna.
How will you search her in dark.
I am coming too.
If anything happens to my baby,
I'll smash Vicky's neck.
No! Not before we get married.
- Nothing will happen Sapna.
The car is shaking.
- No, this isn't right.
In which world are you living.
Thank God! She isn't our Sapna.
Is that a wig?
- Yes, it's a wig - happy!
He has signed the bail,
let them go.
Tell me one thing. You look normal
your brothers don't look mad too...
yet, why did they behave
like lunatics.
We were looking for our niece.
We suspected that car.
Has she run away again?
- Why should she run away?
Then why are you looking for her?
- He sent her out with some boy.
Out! With a boy! Very good
Now she will never elope again.
And you get this clear.
You tell this boy that...
If he ever talks to my niece
again, I'll tear him into pieces.
Inspector, I'm revoking the bail.
Please don't talk about tearing
etc. In the police station.
This is a matter of my niece's
life! I can tear up whom I like,
Why don't you bring your niece
to my place someday?
Why?
- My nephew is a runaway kid.
He ran thrice. Let the two of them
elope together.
Mister.
Your Mace.
Just because of the two of you,
the priest and the wrestler...
Landed in the jail and I
had to bail them out.
From now on, you meet only during
day and better be careful.
You know my wrestler brother is
so dangerous...
That tells us how much the
Wrestler loves his niece.
And his love is going to prove
costly for our love.
Is that right uncle?
- Uncle, think of something!
Do you get out of bed these days?
- Her uncle makes sure.
Uncle, He is Airport.
It's the restaurant now. The
travel agency has been closed.
Have to do something for living.
But here you're... still together?
But the credit goes to me. The two
of you come close because of me.
You introduced them?
I met you at the airport.
You must do something for me.
- Would you like to work for me?
What work?
- Wooing her uncles.
I'd do anything for you buddy.
Will you keep talking,
or will you take orders?
Here's your pad. Here's your pen.
- Why?
He's my boss. Take the order:
Three, no 4 sandwiches and 4 tea.
I've kicked your job. Now I'm a
guest. Please be courteous.
What do we do about the
priest and the wrestler?
Priest can be wooed
through religion.
Something like praying or
singing a devotional song.
What's Rahul doing with uncle?
What's your name?
- Rahul.
Nice name. Rahul, are you married?
- No sir.
What do you think about marriage?
- Even Lord Ram Married.
I'm mere human.
- Your speak so sweetly!
Lf you don't mind I'd like you
to meet my niece.
She's virtuous and God fearing.
I don't want to refuse you.
- Thank you very much.
Tomorrow, I'll bring my niece
along. God bless you.
Rahul! Have you become a priest?
No! I just happen to like
that priest's niece.
What are you saying?
- But she won't even look at me!
I don't know, but I'm wooing the
uncle to marry the niece.
You haven't changed a bit!
Come let's go somewhere.
Right now!
- Yes.
In these clothes?
- So What?
No, let's meet later.
- Six? A Jogger's park?
For peeping at girls!
Why have you brought me here?
- It's so peaceful here.
We can pray here in peace.
Lovely! Such a purity of thought!
I've found a pure boy for you.
What were you saying in the
morning? Some priest... and niece?
I was wooing that priest.
He has a very pretty niece.
And I like her.
- Then you should woo the niece!
I've been trying to woo her.
But she won't even look at me.
I thought, why not woo her uncle?
Took me one month to woo him.
Now he's going to get me
married to his niece.
He's bringing her over to meet me.
That would be nice. You'll mend
your ways after wedding.
Prayers, temples etc. Will be good
- Are you out of your mind.
I'm not about to go dressed like
that after the wedding.
After the wedding I'll give that
baldly uncle a tight kick.
Uncle! What happened?
My job will be done.
- And mine too. Bye.
Make sure you come to the wedding.
- Sure.
I touch your feet priest! You were
to bring you niece tomorrow!
Come on, Uncle.
Splendid!
- Marvelous!
Such knowledge at so young an age!
I've never seen such a man before.
All by the grace of the Lord!
I seek you blessings.
You wish to ask a questions. Ask.
What do you think of marital life?
I have full faith in marital life.
God sends us to earth to fulfill
all our missions.
Worship, marriage, family,
children - all are necessary.
Are you married.
Modern girls prefer English-
speaking, ill-dressed, dancing and
dancing males. Who will marry a
Brahmin like him?
But I am destined to marry.
Though I do not know where she is.
She is right here! And she seeks
a husband, someone like you.
Please, hold him here for a while.
I'll bring the girl over.
Certainly.
- Please don't leave, I'll be back
Your prayer has been answered.
Bless the name of the Lord.
Uncle fell for it.
What's the hurry? Wait a while.
- I can't hold this back.
How many times have I told you to
eat desi laxative?
What is the matter, Uncle?
- Keep your voice down.
A this minute the God has sent a
right boy at right time for you.
What do you mean?
- Such purity of thought and mind.
You'll be glad to meet him.
- Why should I meet him?
You'll marry him! No! You mustn't
say no to your uncle.
Meet him first. Then decide.
- All right Uncle, if you insist.
Let me see, if that godless fellow
is lurking outside.
This is the girl. My niece.
Beautiful!
- She is as virtuous
Without doubt.
Talk to this gentleman,
exchange views.
And let me know.
- Sure.
Excuse me, please.
You too
- Sure.
You look great in that outfit.
- Touch me not.
All your uncle told you was
to exchange views.
I want your views about love.
World is crazy to worship
stone images of God
But nobody worships wheel of stone
which grinds wheat for eating.
Reading books doesn't take you to
God. But love does take.
Uncle Prabhu has been coned.
Now what about Uncle Bholu?
The Wrestler is like coconut.
Hard from outside - soft inside.
A wrestler is won by wrestling or
by defeating a noted wrestler,
Why will a noted wrestler
lose a match from a novice?
Why will he give himself
a bad name?
Because Chirkunda, Rustom of Sri
Lanka happens to be my friend.
He'll take a beating for my sake.
- Why will he spoil his name.
He's a friend. He'll take it.
What's his name?
- Chirkunda.
He's very dangerous! And very
powerful, Let's take a look.
He looks like a joker form circus.
- I've heard he's dangerous.
What language is he speaking?
From his expression he seems to be
throwing an open challenge.
Challenge? I'll go and
break his bones.
No! Lf you lose, you'll force me
to marry him! I won't.
Who'll lose - me!
Just you wait and see.
Why are you late?
Now Uncle has gone to fight him.
What do we do?
- Leave it all to Uncle.
Where are you going? Come back.
Turncoat! When I was being beaten...
you were laughing!
What else could I have done?
Raja, save him!
- Come, let's go home.
I can't bear to see a friend
getting bashed up.
You can't leave him like this.
And if its truel avenge me.
Revenge against Uncle.
No! No, Chirkunda.
You'll get me killed for this!
This is a hospital, silence.
This Uncle has got to be fixed.
- Last time you tried, it flopped.
Try something else.
But do something about him.
I must do something!
- Bye, brother.
Bholu here. Who is there?
You think you are a great
wrestler!
I am a wrestler.
You think you're a champion just
because you beat a loser?
Fight me, if you dare.
- Over the phone?
Come to the ring if you dare!
- I'm calling right form the ring.
And I'm standing in the ring!
- Come, son.
Floored!
Putting on a wristling suit
doesn't make a wrestler.
You were daring me over the phone!
Like the taste of it?
Get up.
Now let me show you the
back slammer.
That was the specimen.
Looks like I've failed.
- No.
No tensions. I was just playing
around with your uncle.
Do you want I bash him up?
- No.
No?
- Yes!
Watch this.
This uncle is floored too.
Happy wedding.
Didn't I tell you I'd do anything
for the sake of your love?
When did you say that?
- I didn't?
No.
- Then let me say it now.
I'd do anything for the
sake of your love.
First take care of Uncle.
- Let him sleep.
No! Go on.
Hi father of a son!
How come you got knocked out?
Yes, I got knocked out.
But I am happy man.
Why?
I was looking for someone just
as pretty as you are.
What for?
Don't get scared. For my niece.
- She wrestles too? Call her.
She doesn't. But I want
her to get married.
So?
- She's going to marry you.
Show me the girl first.
- She's standing next to you.
She is nice! Ask her first
if she will marry me.
You ask.
Will you marry me?
Says nothing.
Why did you pump up all this
muscle for? Make her consent.
Go on. Woo her. Knock her out!
- Knock her out?
Do I have your blessings?
- Sure.
I'll come tonight
To take you out''
I'll show you a movie
And take you for outing''
You will be happy to know that I
have chosen a boy for Sapna.
Which bum?
- Must be some hopper dancer.
Who does a jig and talks English.
I don't care what you say. Sapna
likes him. Don't you Sapna?
Sapna is saying that
just to please you.
Actually she likes the priest.
Right my child?
Shut up! Sapna loves my wrestler.
He's the one she's going to marry.
Right my Child?
- No way, Sapna will marry Raja.
She marries the priest.
- The wrestler.
As you three love me, I too like
all three of your boys.
But how can you marry all three?
- Let's invite all three.
Then we'll decide who's good,
who's bad and who's worthless.
Will you stop laughing
and say something?
Your drama has reached the climax.
My uncles are inviting the three...
boys they have chosen to diner.
And I have to choose one of them,
- And then?
But how will three of you come?
- We will. Mummy, Daddy, and I.
The guests are here.
- Must be my Pundit ji.
Must be my wrestler.
- Time will tell.
This is my Pundit.
How come you're in a suite?
But you look nice.
This is my wrestler.
He looks so beautiful.
This is the boy I chose and who
went out with Sapna that night...
when you smashed up cars and
landed in jail.
I met Raja when I ran away
to Europe.
When I returned I introduced
him to Uncle Vicky.
And according to my plan he played
priest and wrestler to woo you.
Before all that happened,
he was my son.
Such a big fraud! This means
you're no wrestler. You're acting.
Nor is he a priest! He faked it!
He has insulted religion.
For the sake of his love!
- Not love! You're getting even.
Because we threw you out!
This play is for humiliating us.
Give that gift back!
Else, I'll slap you.
Did you think you'd pull the wool
over our eyes and whisk her away?
Uncle, I love Raja.
Love for that boy means so much to
you? Is our love nothing?
I accept, my son has been foolish.
But he did it because of his love.
The two of them love each other.
Don't tear them apart.
We like Sapna too.
We don't like your son. Our
daughter isn't going to marry him.
Please excuse us.
They have come proposing marriage.
And this is how you treat them.
You might not like the proposal,
but I like it.
Let's go Raja.
Sapna, am I American?
- No.
French? German? Russian?
- No! You're Indian.
Then? Had I wanted to, I could've
taken you away long ago.
You are very lucky, Sapna. I've
only one father one mother.
You've three of them, They're like
three mothers and fathers to you.
And they love you very much.
Till they agree,
I won't marry you.
Let's go.
Stop them! There's still time!
Stop them, I say!
You were in league with them!
He was guiding them.
You teamed up with stranger to
cheat your own brothers.
I did it all for Sapna's good!
- Hit him.
Ass! And we wish her ill?
- Yes you wish her ill.
Hit him
- You think we're women?
What haven't we done for Sapna?
We sacrificed our youth for her.
For her sake, we never married!
You never married because no one
ever came with a proposal for you.
Step out. You'll hear neighbors
saying three lunatics live here.
No one ever gives their
daughters to mad men.
You want Sapna to stay a spinster
due to your obstinacy and madness.
What's wrong with Raja, I ask you.
He did it for sake of his love.
Sapna can never find a better
boy than Raja.
And the truth of it is that you
don't want Sapna to marry.
You're scared of loosing her...
and having to live all alone.
All this happened because of me!
Lf I'd not told you about Sapna,
you won't have dreamt about her.
Nor Raja would've fallen for her.
We would never have seen this day.
We had such hopes.
A family in mourning.
It's just a wedding gone sour.
But you love Sapna.
- Yes, but I love you two more.
But son...
- They've insulted you twice.
This I won't tolerate.
Unless they apologize...
- They'll never apologize.
Let them not. You get me
married to someone else.
You're behaving as if
your son has died.
Get me married to someone else.
- All right, son.
Why are you crying?
Yes you are crying! Why?
- Death be to your enemy.
Bholu..., Prabhu..., Vicky!
- Grandpa!
Don't worry my child, I'm here.
I've come to know everything.
Greetings, Daddy.
What you have forgotten is that I
gave you a blossom to tend.
You are only the fiduciary.
You have no right to own.
How dare you go around looking for
a boy for my granddaughter?
Yes, we went looking,
but it was a bad choice.
We have been betrayed. We Can't
make out the nature of men.
I have found a boy for Sapna.
I know there can be none better.
And he is the one Sapna will
marry. I'm taking her away.
You are right Daddy. Sapna has
lived as we have directed her.
She has never lived her own life.
Take her away, Daddy.
A least, she will be able to
breathe the free air.
Uncle, you'd never even let me go
out of the house.
And now you're asking him
to take me away?
I'll inform you about her wedding.
Come and give her your blessings.
When Sapna was here, this house
was so lively! Now it's lifeless.
Who knows whom she's
going to marry.
No one else can love Sapna more
than Raja! You will regret this.
You should've told me this
yesterday.
You weren't listening to me
yesterday. You were out to kill me
I'm a wrestler.
Thick in the skull.
Sometimes, think like I do!
- But did you say what you think?
You won't listen!
- You never said.
Enough!
Don't start to fight again?
Let's go over to Raja's house.
After the way we insulted them,
will they ever let us in?
We can always apologize.
- And we'll beg of them.
All right. Let's go.
Seems to be wedding going on.
Are you out of your mind?
We've come to see Mr. Oberoi.
He starts dancing at the
beat of drums!
The Gandhi's three monkeys!
But you mean to do
exactly the opposite.
Listen to no one.
Shut you eyes to reality.
Don't let anyone speak the truth.
Forgive us.
My brothers regret what they did.
They do no appear to.
We're ready to marry our niece.
You're ready?
- Yes.
You speak as if you're emperors!
But now, we're not willing.
Why?
- My son is getting married today.
Didn't I tell you there's no
dearth of girls for my son?
You can't do this.
- Who are you stop me?
You don't marry your niece and you
want to stop my son's marrying.
Your son loves our niece.
Now you realize it?
Weren't they in love before?
This is a happy day.
My son is getting married.
Please don't spoil my mood.
And I'm not ill-mannered like you
to tell my guest to get out.
Go on. Eat lunch. Bless the couple
And leave when you please. Get it?
You are here for Raja's wedding?
And how is Sapna?
You know how much Sapna loves Raja
- Sapna must marry Raja.
Ask your boss to stop this wedding
It's so ominous.
Three of you're completely mad!
You threw me out. I put with it.
Then you throw Mr. Oberoi out!
You expect him to tolerate that?
Lf I say what you're proposing,
I'll get thrown out of here too.
Forgive me.
Why have you come in this
women's function. Please leave.
Please, save Sapna's life.
- You're the one who can save her.
Mr. Oberoi will listen to you.
Please tell him to stop wedding.
Please let Sapna marry Raja.
We've apologized to Mr. Oberoi.
- We apologize to you too.
The decision is his. Not mine.
His decision can't be changed.
Let's bring the bride.
- Excuse me.
Raja, we're here!
- Why are you here?
My brothers have agreed!
- Please refuse this marriage.
And please marry Sapna.
- Are you out of your mind?
You've come to a wedding,
and you're trying to stop it?
Remember how he knocked you out?
- Let's discuss that later.
Not once. You insulted daddy twice
- I'll tender 200 apologies.
We've apologized already.
We also apologized to your mother.
If that's not enough, I'll shoot
these two, and I'll kill myself.
You and Sapna love
each other very much.
How will you live without
each other?
You want me to break away from
this marriage, and marry Sapna?
Then what'll happen to this girl?
We are Sapna's not only uncles,
we are her mother and father.
We've made a mistake.
Forgive us Raja!
Fall at his feet.
We beg of you.
