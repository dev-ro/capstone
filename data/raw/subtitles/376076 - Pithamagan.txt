Bodinayakkanur.
CEMETERY
Bodinayakkanur Cemetery.
Who are you, dear?
How did you come here?
Oh God!
Lord Shiva himself
has taken birth. Have a look.
TAMILINI
Why are you crying? ls it because
your mother is dead?
Or is it because you were
born in a cemetery?
This is the place where
Lord Shiva resides.
You shouldn't cry.
You're born with death as the boon.
Do you know who you're?
You're the son of Lord Shiva.
You're going to spend
your entire life here.
O crescent moon! You're born
for a good cause.
O flower! You've blossomed.
No need to grow feeble.
You've taken birth where lives end.
Your dawn is here.
TAMILINI
Were you keen to live a
solitary life on this earth?
With that determination did
you ask for this boon?
Those who want to see the
face can look at it.
l'm going to cover the face.
Either it's a garden or a desert,
flowers are flowers, their
identities will never change.
Neither poverty nor
affluence can change you.
Know who you're.
Tell me what are your
belongings in this world.
Know who you're.
TAMILINI
Only the dead
come in search of you.
Human bonds mean nothing to you.
Those who rolled in money,
those who were proud
of their position,
those who were at the
pinnacle of fame.
Those who became famous
& then became infamous,
you saw these attributes
being burnt to ashes.
You're the man of crystal clear mind.
l've none.
l never saw my mother &
l'm the son of the cemetery.
My life is with the dead.
l'm the common son of God & Earth.
Did you die to make me
understand this truth?
You've left this Chitthan stranded.
Gomathi, how are you?
Give me a packet worth Rs.10.
Can't you tender exact change?
Am l running a bank?
Do you want a bank to be
handed over to a drug peddler?
The bank will be swindled.- l see.
You usually take brandy.
What happened to you now?
What do you mean?
Brandy for the work l do!
They had launched mini bottles
3 months back.
They've stopped them now.
l've no other choice other than this.
Give me 2 packets.
Are you studying?
l won't give.- Why sister?
What sister? Look at the
faces taking drugs.
Do you pull a cart or pedal rickshaw?
They take drugs to get
rid of the pain.
What's wrong with you people?
Stop advicing. We are paying money,
aren't we? Give it.
l'll slipper you, Get lost.
- Talk respectfully.
What bloody respect.
Are you taking drugs at this age?
- Forget it Gomathi.
Our bodies will be finally eaten up by
worms in the sand, let them enjoy.
Get lost.
Look at this face, idiot.
They've started taking drugs
at a very young age.
Hey, what's it?
He's a cremator, isn't he?
He has come to ruin our
livelihood. Get lost.
l say get lost.
Hey, kick him out.
You shouldn't come to these places.
Go there & eat.
l say, go...
Won't you listen to me?
l say get lost.
How dare you stare at me?
Why this wall-eyed stare?
Throw him out.
You're eating as if
you've paid for it.
Why are they fighting like this?
You people are simply watching
the show, stop them.
Go away.
Get lost.
Have you also joined hands
with him & hitting us?
He's a cremator,
do you know that?
He's just walking into the shop.
What are you people looking at?
Go...Go...
You've opened the eatery for others
to come & eat, haven't you?
How can you call yourself
a respectable elder?
How can you simply watch
them fighting?
You don't interfere.
He'll eat and go away.
Thinking that l'm preparing food
from the rice offered to dead,
won't the stinking villagers curse me?
Why did you open the shop
in this stinking village?
Stinking villagers!
You're stinking like a corpse
even when you're alive.
Only God knows how badly
you'll stink when you die.
O Bravo! You want food,
don't you? Come.
Come.
Scoundrel. He has ruined
my shop in a short while.
Light the stove.
lf you fight on the streets,
police will arrest all of you. Got it?
Eat.
My God. lt seems you've been starving.
lf no one dies in the village,
you'll be in a fix.
Hey, give him water.
Brother, remember my face,
they'll bring me there soon.
lf my body gets up from
the burning pyre,
don't hit it. l won't be able
to bear the pain.
Just scold. l'll lie down.
Give it to me. Give it to me.
Hey what man? Get lost.
Hey...
l got terribly scared.
Look at the way, he's glaring.
Hey, get up and go.
Simply sticking behind me.
You'll not go?
Hello, what else do you need?
Don't you've any job?
Why do you trouble me?
Job? l've a District Magistrate's job.
Would you like to take it up?
Very good.
l'm eking my livelihood
by peddling packets.
Now you've also joined me?
l thought of working as a
servant maid leaving this job.
But they've branded me
as drug peddler.
How do you expect me
to get you a job?
Hey, where was he hiding?
- Behind...''hills''.
l don't know, what's going
to happen to you.
Drag him and come.
Go man...Go...
How much money did you take?
Did you take it from the
policeman or narcotics people?
Taking money from them is equal
to eating their defiled food.
Sir, please leave him.
Sir please don't....
He did it unknowingly.
He did it unknowingly. Leave him.
lt's enough, leave him.
l say leave. He might die.
l shouldn't see his face again.
Hey Lawyer, come here.
Lawyer, dump all the crimes on him for
the cases police are hunting our men,
and send him behind bars.
Hey, will you accept?
- Yes sir, l'll....
He has accepted, hasn't he? Why do
you get tensed? You're already sick?
Shit!
Hey, don't think
l've become old.
l'll chop each one of you
into pieces.- Hey take him.
My name is imprinted on the each
& every grain that you eat.
Be loyal.
Sir...
What do you want?
Do you want to get it only from me
what you're selling?
Get it from them.
l want a job.
What's wrong with your present job?
Not for me, for him.
Do you think the workers
working here are helpful to me?
ls he going to help me?
No job.
Don't say like that.
Even he's an orphan like me.
He was brought up in the
cemetery right from his birth.
Poor guy, he doesn't know
how to mingle with village people.
Police, money etc...He doesn't know
any of those things.
What else he knows then?
You mentioned something just now,
loyalty. He only knows that.
He's sticking around me like a dog
for feeding him just once.
Hey buddy, take him along
with you to the hills.
Sir, why take him to such a far
off place. Give him some job here.
Hey don't order me.
By then, l finished my
diagram & submitted it.

You're reaching only now.
Hey, will you like to have tea?
- Greetings sir.
Hey bring tea.
What sort of a person

He's smoking beedi without knowing

How can l entrust this job to them?
Couldn't you give them the job
after knowing their past?
You're blaming him.
Look at the one who's coming.
He doesn't know the value
of money, people etc.
Look, he's not greeting also.

Go away man.
You go.
Why are you just watching uncle?
Person who salutes will

'Kalnar'.
'Kalnar' Basil oil.
An oil made from
18 rarest herbs.
What do you mean 'Rarest'?
Taking birth as a human
is the rarest thing.
Taking birth without any handicap
is still rarer.
Thank you very much.
O Lord! You rule this world
with Tamil language.
What is cruel?
Poverty is cruel.
Poverty at youth is still cruel.
What shit profession is this?
Buy me a couple of pigs.

to them & getting money from them.
We must pay our house rent.
Come on, sing.
Having a disease is a very
cruel thing.
This is said by Poetess Avaiyar
& not by me.
lf you ask any one which is
the deadliest disease?
Many will say 'AlDS'.
A few will say 'Leprosy'.
lf you ask me, l swear on you,
World's deadliest disease
is Gas trouble.
lt means letting out
the Gas collected in you.
l'm not saying this for you
people to laugh. Think.
Superb idea.
They are giving us chocolates
for the balance change.
lf we file a case against them
in Consumer court,
we'll get Rs. 1 lac.
Oh God! She's always after money.
- They've started the show.
Park the cycle &
get the token fast.
Go.
Move....move.
My dear people, l'm going to narrate
a story to you.
Come closer & listen.
ln America, there lived a husband
& wife with children.
Poor husband!
He had gas trouble.
While sleeping at night,
he let the gas out.
Because her husband,
farted,
she said that
she lost her sleep.
The wife filed a case, got
divorced & took away her son.
He could've appealed
in the Supreme Court.
Was it to file an appeal or
to let out his gas?
l'm narrating you the story,
am l not?
But here, our boys eat Peas
in huge quantities while boozing,
and at night lets out the gas
in all directions.
lf his wife ask him, ''why are you tearing
the clothes given by my father?''
He'll say 'Get lost'.
and he also says 'Barking dogs
seldom bite'.
lt means, if we let our gas out slowly,
it'll stink.
Will it smell sweet
if we let it out loudly?
ln a public place where
people gather & talk,
one guy will let out the gas.
Everyone will close his nose.
The one who let it out will say,
'Some scoundrel has exploded a bomb'.
Because he knows it first.
People will even accept
murder charge.
But no one will accept that
he has let out the gas.
But why?
lt's the matter of his honor.
Your silence,
makes me feel that many of you
would've done this.
No problem.
Your gas trouble which hasn't been
cured by any country medicine,
just take a spoonful
of the medicine l give you,
the gas will come out with the
fragrance of a flower.
The next problem we are
going to tackle is...
Constipation.
- Yes, Constipation!
Constipation gives rise
to many problems.
A man must shit twice,
morning & evening.
Let anyone die in your house,
you must not stop that.
lf we stop it,
we'll also stink along with
the dead body.
Don't mistake me for talking
about issues which stink.
Priest, do you want it?
No, l don't.
l'm just watching.
l know, you won't need this.
Because, after taking bath,
he'll go around the basil plant thrice
& will eat a couple of Basil leaves.
But, we are not like that.
Like the dogs which
search the lamp-post,
we search for a place full of plants
& creepers and we'll piss there.
Don't mistake me for
praising a particular caste.
Many people from Brahmin family,
hold high posts like
Engineers, Doctors & Judges.
Because they know the
importance of Basil leaf.
You also give this
to your children.
Their memory power will increase.
Vomiting & constipation will stop.
lf they don't stop,
l'll stop selling.
Come & get it, sir.
- Give me one....
Everyone, take it.- Give me one. Give
this to your grandsons & grand daughters.
Get me one. Give me some more.
Come....come.
lt smells like sison seeds.
This is the nature of our people.
You raise umpteen number of questions
when we come to serve you.
lf anyone books a room
in a lodge.
And advertise in paper about the
time & date of consultation,
you'll go there on time.
And they'll grab you like a hen,
and will leave you after swindling
Rs.2,000 to 3,000 from you.
We are not like them.
Our medical store is
right in front of you.
As l tell them the percentage of medicine,
he'll crush them & he'll grind them
into paste. Come & buy it.
She's coming.
Why did you bring the police now?
Stay here.
lt's a gift to your children from us.
Come....come.- Give me a bottle.
A bottle costs only Rs.50.- Give me a
bottle.- Come on.- Give it to me.- Who else?
Brother-in-law, give me 4 bottles.
Come & buy.
You're finished.
Leave me, you pig.
Oh no! Why are you hitting her?
Why are you beating a girl like this?
Don't beat her.- Oh my god!
Why are you beating a girl like this?
Leave her. You Karuppan!
You scoundrel!
Hey, it's police....
Oh my god! Police.
Hey....- Hey Manju!
You thief!
Don't come....don't come.- Stop.
Stop.
How dare you bring the police?
You useless girl!- Oh no!
Manju....stop.
Get up....get up.
Where are you trying to run away?
l won't leave you.
Get down.- l won't.
Oh God! Why are you running with a girl
on your back? Put her down.
Oh my god!
Oh my god!
Go & catch her quickly. Manju....
Come, girls. He's running in the same
direction. Follow me....follow me.
l can't....l can't. Get down.
Catch him. Don't leave him.
Come....come....catch him.
Police....
Catch her....catch her.
Police.....police...
Hold his hand...
You fraud!
Police....Police....
- Beat him.
Listen to me.
She's trying to kill me &
you're coming late, you fatso!
Oh no! sister...sister.
The head constable is opening the lock.
Ask him to stay aside.- Get in.
Okay, see you later.
The place looks like a Star hotel.
l'm Sakthi....Sakthivel.
Manufacturer of medicine
without license, 420.
And you?
Come on, tell me.
Chit fund.
Chit fund owner!
How's that possible?
l'm a compulsive liar.
But no one gets trapped.
How do they fall in your trap?
They see me & believe me.
How can l be faulted?
Do people believe you, if you speak
Tamil language incorrectly?
l'll try this, once l go out.
Thank you Guruji.
And you?
Eve teasing.
He teased a girl.- What?
l only asked her name.
But they've put me in
for 3 months.- Oh no!
lnstead of marrying a girl
whom you love,
if you marry the girl
who loves you.
Oh god! - The proverb
looks old, doesn't it?
Fraud may prevail on justice
for time being.
But justice will win in the end.
No sir.
Whether she loves me or not,
l'll live in her memories till death.
Fate is powerful.
l just slapped my wife
for pocket money.
She put me in jail on dowry charge.
lt's a lie.
What did he do at this age?
Don't you know him?
He has appeared in Sun TV channel too.
Ask him his name?
Saint Ambalavana Swamigal.
That's why his sitting
posture is different.
What did Ambalavanar do?
Ask him what he didn't do?
He went to North to sell cereals.
This beard fellow sold cereals
by speaking Tamil language.
Since his looks & language
was different,
they took him to be a saint.
This saint never kept quiet.
He harassed many women
including foreign girls.
He could've stay put with that.
A 10th std. girl.
She went to get his blessings
before going to Examination.
He harassed her too.
You stinking shit!
Your story has gone to dogs.
They accepted you as a saint.
lnstead of eating the apples &
oranges they offered you,
& keeping everything hush-hush,
you indulged in sex,
and you're laughing.
You could do this only in lndia.
lf you had sold
your cereals in Dubai...
My son.
What's it father? We are all the
birds of the same feather.
Hello!
He's biting me.
- lt's alright, my son.
Alright? l'll slipper you.
Slowly. lt might slip & fall down.
l'm telling you.
lf he had hit the policemen,
does that mean, he's a
big shot? Go & tell him.
Lock him up.
Cremator!
Beat him to pulp.
Lift him.
Get me some water.
lt's nothing...nothing.
Sleep....sleep. They are not here.
Sleep.
lf you keep beating
& biting everyone,
they'll never ever release you.
Once you come here,
eat well, build your body and go out.
There he is.
Swamiji!
How are you Jennifer?- l'm fine.
Sakthi.- Come here.
Sakthi, are you fine?
Seal your affection in a box
& get me the beedi.
You know her, don't you?
l know. She's Gomathi who
sells drugs, isn't she?
Why are you shouting?
Why is his face swollen?
He should've been quiet.
Buddy, he dipped me in
the Gravy vessel.
Shit! Are you not ashamed?
Will the Jailer spare him
if he beats him?
Look here.
l was beaten on the
day l came here.
What were your men doing
when you were being beaten?
He's hitting us in a
different way.
Will everyone be like me?
- You know nothing about him.
He was born & brought up
in cemetery. Poor guy!
Hail Lord Ambala...
You shit! l'm going to crush you.
Do it silently.
Oh! ls he like this because of that?
Do something. Come in &
save my honor.
This can't go for long.
l'll take care as long as l'm here.
Arrange to take him on bail.
Jennifer, l love you.
- l love you too. Take care.
You're a lucky man...
Go....go.
Oh my god! l'm unable to go out of
the station peacefully leaving her here.
She always gets into trouble.
Why should it bother you if
someone sells something?
You went to watch a movie.
You could've watched it & come home.
l can't live like others.
This Manju will punish anyone
who commits a mistake.
Oh my god!
Did we had to do the penance at
Tirupathi hill to give birth to you?
Useless girl!- l don't care.
But one thing,
l'll come home with an award.
No one should touch that.
- Shut up.
l am worried about what he'll do
after coming out of the jail,
and you're talking
about getting an award.
Hey cheat!- Call me Sakthi.
Okay, come. Someone has
come to see you.
Why are you coming here often?
Come inside, if your affection
for me is over-flowing.
Polytechnic.- Doctor...
l ask your forgiveness for giving
birth to this useless girl.
Please forget all those things.
Have you finished asking for
forgiveness? Let's go.
Wait. We elders are
talking, aren't we?
You talkative girl!
You're still adamant after
committing all the mistakes.
When l came to know about
the incident,
l was clue less.
l've lost my peace of mind
because of her.
Just say you've forgiven me.
Only then, l can live
in peace. Please...
lt's all right....
Father!
You're repeatedly begging to a fraud.
What happened? Why are you crying?
l didn't feel bad for
being put in the jail.
She's calling me a fraud again
& again. How can l bear it?
l don't know to which god am
l'm going to tell all this.
Don't cry...Don't cry.
Sir...Sir...
Look, he's crying.
lf you hurt others, can you be happy?
Seek his pardon...Seek his pardon.
Father.
Have you gone mad?
Yes, because l gave birth
to you, isn't it?
lt's all right, seek his pardon.
- l won't.
Why?
Father, you don't know about him.
He cheated me by rolling the dice.
He's a big fraud.
Hey.
lt's a last chance for you.
- Tell me.
Rs.400 which you grabbed
from me fraudulently.
And my H.M.T Watch.
Then the fine amount of Rs.500
which l paid in the train.
Then, l spent Rs.75 for coming here.
lf you agree to return
the amount l've spent,
l'll get you released.
Oh God, Are you really an educated girl?
Or you're simply roaming around
wearing pant and shirt?
Are you the President to order
my release?
Why not?
Did they catch you?
l handed you over to them.
Are these beatings not enough for you?
Sir, what's this?
l was washing my clothes.
You called me & irritated me.
Beat her nicely & take her away.
Hey, what did you say?
A woman can do anything,
do you know?
Hey, look at me.
lf l don't show my mercy on you
you'll die here itself.
Hey, what are you looking at?
Sir, you go outside.
Hey.
lf you don't show mercy on me,
won't l get release?
You're proudly saying,
''l only caught you''.
That day, l was carrying you
on my back, right?
How much time would it have taken me
to remove your skirt & run away?
l didn't get this idea now.
l got this idea that day itself.
They say, ''Women's curse will not
go in vain''. That's why, l left you.
Understood?- Yes.
My son! This is a sin.
- Go to hell man.
He has ruined a small girl's life,
and calling me a sinner?
Move away....Move...
Leave it, brother.
Why should we get in trouble?
Leave me, this has become
common here.
No...Leave him.
Listen to me...Leave him.
l say leave him.
No.
Leave him....l say leave him.
Hey, jailer will come...Stop it.
Get on feet quickly!
He has come...Be calm.
Hey, lets go.
What's going on here?
Sir, it's nothing.
Then, why are you both rolling?
l was trying to brief him how to fight.
You? - Yes, sir.
Briefing him!
Bring him.
sir....sir.
You'll reform only if l brief you.
Sir, l swear. We were just practising.
You arrogant fellow.
- Sir, l swear.
Sir, why have you put me
in the dark room?
Oh God!
Sir, it pains.
Sir, please leave me.
...forgive me.
Sir, it's paining.
Leave me.
Sir, please leave me.
TAMILINI
Who's he who has woken up
my slumbering heart?
My soul is seeking his identity
& his whereabouts.
When the cuckoo was in wilderness,
and when it was unaware
of the ways of the world,
did you come as its companion?
Will you be with it
for its entire life?
Who's he who has woken up
my slumbering heart?
TAMILINI
Where were we yesterday?
And today we are here.
The future is not in our hands.
Were we destined to face
all that had happened?
Or all this is happening,
because of our destiny?
We are ignorant about it.
l'll take leave.
Chitthan, l can't stay here,
even if l wish to.
lf they release me,
l've to go out.
Only 10 days, okay?
Bye.
My son...my son.
Hey, put it out.
He's about to come.
You're getting tensed as if
it's school admission for you.
ls he a master?
l should'nt smoke in front you, my sister.
You've fixed him with a nice person.
Hey, get up...He has come.
Greetings, sir.
- Gomathi, what's it?
Who are you?
- Tell him, sister.
Sakthi.
He was with Chitthan in the jail.
What do you want now?
lt's been 3 months.
lt's a surprise that he has been
able to stay there so long.
That's why, l want to bail him out.
You're very casual about it.
lt will cost you 2-3 lakhs,
do you know?
So what?
He has gone to jail,
for your sake, right?
Hey, how many persons have
you told this?
Till now, no one.
lf you refuse to bail him out,
l'll not spare you.
Keep quiet...What's all this?
- You be quiet.
Go.- You beg to him if you want.
Hey Mahadeva, make
arrangements for his bail.
l'll give you one day's time.
Otherwise l'll reveal everything
to the judge. Be careful.
Hey, go man.
- Take care of your, Cannabis fields.
Gomathi, what's all this?
That day, you asked for a
job for an orphan.
And today, someone has come
on behalf of him
lf he does anything even for fun,
do you know it's consequences?
Sir, don't mistake him.
He talked like that out of affection.
lf you be merciful & get him released,
l'll be grateful to you.
Okay, l'll do the needful.
But one thing, don't allow him to be
friendly with such touts.
Are we doing a legal business?
Go.
Come fast...
Let's go for a ride.
lt's me.
That's it.
Hello....- Leave my hand.
Give me my watch.
Shall l go?- Go.
l went to jail because of you.
But you're not talking to me.
How can l talk here?
lf someone see us.
Let them see.
You don't care for anyone.
Stop it...l've changed now.
lt's evident by seeing you.
- What do you see?
You look more beautiful than before.
Thanks..next.
Nice fragrance!
Which soap do you use?
Oh no! l'm feeling shy.
Did you ever think of me?- No.
You're lying.
You must've dreamt about me.
How do you know?
Since l dreamt in that
mosquito infested cell,
wouldn't you've dreamt in your house
which has many air-conditioners?
What did you dream?
- l won't tell you.
lf you tell me,
l'll give you something.
What's it?
Wow! Puffed rice ball.
Manju dear.- l'm coming dad.
Let's talk tomorrow.
- Tomorrow you've college.
Oh God, l'll say 'fever' &
come to the milk farm.
We'll talk.
See you.- Bye.
Who's to be bailed out?
- Chitthan.
How do you know him?
We worked together.
He's a smuggler of Cannabis.
Are you also in the same profession?
No...
lf he doesn't appear in the court,
you'll be arrested, do you know?
Okay.
Sign a bail bond for
Rs.3 lakhs, and take him.
Hey, Chitthan.
Am l a crow to put stones
into this & drink?
Pour some more.
That's enough.
We can't bear your tortures.
Old monk will not
have any effect.
Oh my friend!
You're my soul.
Don't think l'm blabbering
because l'm drunk.
l like you more than Manju.
Reduce your volume.
She might over hear you.
Let her hear.
You get lost.
l was eagerly waiting for you.
Happy!
But l don't like one thing about you.
You don't smile.
Smile...
Smile...
Smile...
l'll start crying
if you don't smile.
Cry.....
Cry....
Cry....
He seems to be crying.
Kiss.....Kiss....
You scoundrels! At last, you
made me to stay hungry.
Gomathi might've cooked something
to eat. We'll ask her.
Ask her! Do you want to be beaten by her?
Shut up & sleep here.
What happened?
Hey, What happened?
Sakthi....Sakthi....
Sakthi....
What shit did you drink?
You stink!
Monk...- What?
Old Monk.
Don't you've any sense? You know, it
doesn't suit him. Why did you give him?
Oh God! l'm going to leave you all.
Shit!
You should've drunk within your limit.
Hey, did you eat?
Who's it?
Sakthi, did you eat?
Who's it?
lt's me. Did you eat?
Who's it?
l'm asking you, did you eat?
Tell me, did you eat?
What did l do?
He's sleeping on empty stomach.
So, l'm trying to wake him up.
Why did you beat me?
You're not allowing me to touch him.
Go to hell.
Enough.
You eat.
You eat.
You eat.
TAMILINI
Cool breeze is blowing.
lt sounds like music.
TAMILINI
lt's flowing through bamboos
& creating music.
The clouds are listening to it.
A peacock is spreading it's
feathers in a stone heart.
lt's drizzling.
The grass has laid a path
& the rainbow has become an umbrella.
The doors of the heart are opening,
hearing the sound of the bell.
The body is floating in the air
with new vibrations.
TAMILINI
Like the threads woven together,
to make a beautiful cloth,
We are woven together
with the bond of love.
Like the mother earth which
pampers & give us food to live,
only a few are blessed
with such noble hearts.
& this world still exists
because of them.
Till yesterday, l was alone with
no one around me.
lf someone accompanies you
in the journey of your life,
it's the best deal one can get.
Nothing is solo in this world.
Flute is accompanied by music
& flowers are accompanied by fragrance.
TAMILINI
The heart is like the sky.
lt gives you riddles everyday.
No one knows the secret.
No one understands this mystery.
The hand that sows the seeds,
also plucks the flowers.
Who made a garland
of those flowers?
Parrots swing holding
the aerial roots,
and are gently narrating stories.
Before asking for a lullaby,
the young jackal runs
in search of mother jackal.
Don't beat me.
l'm from Police department.
Get lost.
He's from the police department.
He was spying on us.
Whenever we get into trouble,
it's he who had blown the whistle on us.
You've not only got our
goods seized,
you've also found our place.
l struggle very hard to send
the goods every month.
And you phone & inform someone
without any strain.
Where's the phone?
- Who wants that phone?
Take him inside.
l'll eat & come.
Go. You scoundrel!
You earn small salary, but you've given
very heavy loss to the boss.
Useless fellow!
lf we bother about things & morality,
we can't eke our livelihood.
Wash it.
Hey....
Take this & burn it
in a remote place.
Think who you're.
Tell me, what's yours in this world?
Parents are for the time being...
Your wife is for the time being...
Your job is for the time being...
Luxurious bungalow is for
the time being...
Reservoir & service
are for time being.
Do you've any sense?
Do you know what you've done?
He never realises...
What are you discussing so vehemently?
You Karuppan! get me 2 pots of water.
Will you do anything he orders?
You Karuppan, come here.
She's calling you, isn't she? Go.
What's this?
Your shirt is full of blood.
What did you do?
Whom did you kill & bury?
lt's nothing. Go.
- His shirt is full of blood.
Tell me whose corpse did you carry?
Why are you shouting now? Get up.
Go inside. Go....
Oh God! He has done something terrible.
At least you go & ask him.- l know.
He has done nothing.
Someone else did it. He burnt it.
That's all.
That's all!
You're saying so cooly.
Will he go to jail again?
- No.
l told you, he didn't do it.
Then, who did it?- Don't shout.
The one whom you put him up for a job.
l sent him to work.
l never thought that he'll
do anything those murderers would say.
He has ruined his life.
What's the use of mourning now?
Where were your senses then?
Don't curse me.
The day l got him a job with them,
l lost my peace.
l had a hunch that something will go
wrong when he went yesterday, l knew...
Do one thing.
Take him to the police station.
And tell them that we are in no way
related to that crime.
Do you want to expose
everything yourself?
Nothing will happen, keep quiet.
Don't talk irrelevantly,
he's innocent.
lf this matter leaks out,
Do you want to see the police beating
& dragging him on the streets?
Don't cry & mourn so loudly.
The entire village might
come to know about it.
lf they catch him for the crime
committed by someone else,
do you think we'll keep quite?
Look, law says that the one who exhorts
to do the crime is the first accused,
& not the one who does it.
Nothing will happen.
He's full of mud & ash.
Go & give him bath.
Throw it down. Get up...
Get up & take bath.
Add turmeric & pour on him.
Let his sins get washed away.
Why are you taking that?
Lets throw them in the fire
& burn them.
Don't move.
How's it?
Smile.
Gomathi, look. He's smiling.
Karuppan, uncle come here.
Look, he's smiling.
You're smiling nicely.
Enough.
You blabber a lot.
Teach him.
Atleast, let him smile.
But don't teach him your
tricks & mal-practises.
What's this sister?
You said you're going
to leave this drug business.
Then how can l continue?
Lying & bluffing will end
with my generation.
Sakthi, don't commit in a hurry.
l can't stay hungry.
- Look at him.
Why are you always after food?
What bothers you?
lf you eat a few grains & drink water,
your hunger will subside.
But l'm different.
l told you to chuck him out.
But you never listened.
Don't fight...Go...
Wow! this too.
Paari brought a chariot.
Girls brought dowry.
A friend in need,
is a friend indeed.
We've brought pens.
Say that again.
What do you see up there all day?
Don't stare at me, talk.
We paint with our hands.
We speak with our mouth.
Come on say... lt'll keep on writing.
They are shooting a film over there.
- Shooting!
Yes.
You Karuppan, come.- Sakthi, come.
Hey stop.- Come fast.
Move...Move.
Karuppan, it's actress Simran.
Silence please.
What different character?
Agaligai
l'll explain.
A thick forest & a saint.
...With long hair.
He has a water jug in his hand.
They are the one who live in forest
wearing ''saffron dress''.
Saint.
Saint.
Sakthi, we stitch the clothes
& then wear them.
Look there, they are wearing them
& getting them stitched.
Shall l come to put the thread
into the needle?
Come on, look at us.
Take your hands off.
Beware! l'll burst a cracker
in your mouth.- Listen to me.
You're shooting in our village
& chasing us out!
l'll spread the rumour that the actress
is out of doors.
What's this?- Get lost.
Oh no! What's that noise?
Hey Hanuman, chase them out.
- They are not going.
Go away.
Who's he?
He's wearing a cap, so,
he's the director.
He's shouting too much.- Yes.
Madam, you go & change your
costume.
Later l'll tell the...
- Okay sir...Okay sir.
You must learn Tamil language.
Or else l must learn English
& make English films.
Hey go.
What are you doing? Leave her.
Who are you?- Take the car.
Who are you?
Cigarette... cigarette.
Lets all turn into ashes.
Chant 'Hare Krishna Hare Ram'
in the morning & in the evening.
Hare Krishna Hare Ram
What's going on here?
You stupid! Why are you
behaving like this?
Why are you keeping quiet?
One second madam.
Hey switch off the phone.
l'll cut your neck.
l'll kill you if you
phone anyone.
Did you see?
l told you l didn't want to
shoot in this village, didn't l?
lf we had given these
dates to Director Maniratnam.
We could've finished the
song in 'Ladakh'.
No madam. Director wanted to
shoot in the forest.
Big forest! ls he directing
Jurassic park?
ls he a director?
bald headed fellow.
l'm in this situation
because of him.
lf he comes in future asking for dates,
l'll slipper him.
l hate this...l hate this.
What's this? Why are you
talking continuously?
Shut up. Country brutes.
Keep quiet. We've kidnapped you but
we are not going to rape you.
What?...Rape?!
Did you see?...- Madam.
Look, what they are saying?
l'm going to shoot them all.
Wow! 'Simran is an angry girl'
published in a magazine is true.
You don't know about me.
Better let me get down.
You don't know what you're doing.
Shut up.- What shut up!
See...- What should l see?
See here...See there..
Shit.
Oh villagers! Listen to
this announcement,
The girl who has left many
young & old men sleepless,
South lndian star...
With a tentalising waist,
Simran is coming.
Come...Madam, come & see.
it's Simran.
Why are you walking slowly? Come.
Without food this man is
roaming on the cycle.
All of them become
dull after seeing his face.
Come & dance here.
- What? Dance? ldiots!
Why are you torturing me like this?
Doesn't anyone has sense?
Madam, why are you
talking like this?
To tempt us to buy the soap,
you're giving an Ad announcing that
you're taking bath 27 times.
Can't you dance for
making us happy?
How fair she is. lt seems
she takes bath in donkey's milk.
What is she saying?
- She is saying you look beautiful.
And she said that you take bath
in donkey's milk.
Say 'No'.- No...
Simran madam, why is your hair brown?
You earn so much can't
you apply coconut oil on them?
Madam, regarding your hair...
They say you're earning so much,
Can't you apply coconut oil?
- Shit!
Leave me l'll go...
Hey! Why are you in a hurry?
You're right. Did we ask
money from you?
We've seen you in
T.V & theaters.
You've come here as Goddess,
what are you going to lose
if you dance here?
What are you seeing man?
Translate it to her...
They are saying you've come
like Goddess.
And they are asking you to dance.
Madam, why are you hesitating?
Even Mahatma Gandhi has
come to this place.
When did he come?
- Hey you be quiet.
They say Gandhiji came here
spending his pocket money.
Oh really?
- Yes...Yes.
lf you dance here,
we'll definitely elect you as
Minister in the next election.
lf you dance here, they'll
elect you as minister.
Madam, look here...
These people have become very old,
before they die, if they
see your dance,
lt'll be imprinted in their life history.
Before they die, they want
to see your dance.
After seeing your dance
they can die peacefully.
So sweet!
Yes...

shed tears?
TAMILINI
Oh! World is in Demon's hand.
Who has given him right to ruin?

TAMILINI
Hey, what are you looking at?
TAMILINI
Hey, why are you taking it?
Hey, what are you doing?
When poverty is chasing our lives,
why should arrogant persons
chase us?
When our sins are chasing us,
why should our enemies chase us?

Both eyes are smarting by
the glow of fire.
The entire body is boiled
to take revenge.
