Finally...
the warring nations of Earth had
forgotten their differences...
and banded together
to save our planet.
The United Global Space Force
was searching the galaxy...
forworlds rich with drinkable
water and breathable air.
The hypergate was our best hope
to colonize space...
our best hopefor survival.
But as we prepared
to launch ourselves...
into the black of space...
terrorists, calling themselves
'The Global Sedition...'
were preparing to strike.
Grissom base,this is Cargo 7
requesting landing clearance.
Roger,transport.
This is Grissom gate control.
Please download security codes.
Downloading.
Transport, l've gottwo blips
inside your radar signature.
They're hiding in your shadow.
l don't see anything.
This is gate control.
Battle stations.
Battle stations.
Two Seditionfighters
are attacking the hypergate.
Battle stations.
Gate control,this is Eagle One.
l'm locked and loaded.
Ready tofly.
Roger, Eagle One.
You're clearto launch.
Jeb,where are you, buddy?
This cold warjust got hot.
They're Sedition raiders.
lt's another
mutant suicide squad.
Here we go. Man-to-man.
Splitthem up.
Last one to kill a bad guy
buys the beer.
l'm gonna go through the gate,
get infront of him.
That's not standard procedure,
Don.
Better get inside his shields.
You gen-techs are ugly up close.
Target lock.
Show time.
Bogey One dispatched.
Don, he's right on my tail.
Damn! Can't shake him.
l've been hit!
Weapons are off-line.
l'm gonna jettison
the main drive core.
There you are.
Am l good orwhat?
Warning. Failure
in redundant drive systems.
Gate control,
this is Ranger One.
Engines will not respond.
Don, l'mfalling
towards the hypergate.
Breaking thrusters won'tfire!
lmpact in 30 seconds.
Ranger One,this is base.
Rescue craft
have been dispatched.
Grissom,those pods will never
reach him in time.
l'm going in.
MajorWest,you are not
authorized to jeopardize--
Never liked that station anyway.
Warning. Proximity alert.
Hang on,Jeb. l'm coming in.
Abort. Abort!
l'll give you a little kiss.
Don'ttake this the wrong way.
lmpact infive seconds.
Does this mean
we're going steady?
You're not getting out
of buying those beers that easy.
With intrepid pioneering spirit,
the Robinsonfamily...
will journey to the distant
world of Alpha Prime.
What kind offuture can
our children lookforward to?
Afuture in paradise.
The Jupiter mission...
made possible by the Army and
Silicon Graphics Corporation.
S.G.l. Saving thefuture
for our children.
Give me a break.
Holo-call
from Houston middle school.
Hello?
Hello, Principal Cartwright.
What has he done this time?
He hacked our main power grid
to run his experiment.
The school was in chaos.
Yeah, right.
We didn't even have lights.
This is no laughing matter,
Professor Robinson.
Will is terribly gifted.
The changing shape of education.
His little time machines,
though purefancy...
are the products
of a truly brilliant mind.
No more monkey business.
l mean it.
The boy is starved
for attention.
l know your life is anything
but normal right now...
butwasn'tthere some way...
hisfather could have
attended the sciencefair?
As you are aware...
Alpha Prime is the only other
habitable planet...
yet detected
by deep space recon.
My crew will sleep away
our 10-yearjourney there...
in suspended animation.
Once we have rendezvoused with
the research colony on Alpha...
l will supervise
construction of a hypergate.
By then,
technicians here on Earth...
will have completed
the companion hypergate...
in our planet's orbit.
Once both gates are complete...
ships will be able to pass
instantaneously between them.
lmmediate colonization
of Alpha Prime will be possible.
Can'tyou just use
the Jupiter's hyper-engine...
to zap straightto Alpha Prime?
Hyperspace exists
beneath normal space.
If you try to enter hyperspace
without a gate...
your exitfactor is random.
There's no telling
where you'd come out.
Ninety-eight percent of
the galaxy is still uncharted.
There's a lot of space
to get lost in.
How is Captain Daniels
recoveringfrom theflu?
Will he pilotthe mission?
Ladies and gentlemen.
You came to getyourfirst look
atthe Jupiter 1.
Don'tyou think
you've waited long enough?
Let's move into the launch dome.
One more question, Professor.
Now thatthe mission's
been pushed up...
how do your childrenfeel
about leaving the earth behind?
They couldn't be more excited.
This mission sucks!
l don'twanna leave early.
l don'twanna go at all.
We will discuss this at dinner.
Forthe lastthree years, l've
missed everything training...
so l can spend the next 10 years
missing everything else.
l'm not staying homefor dinner.
l'm seeing myfriends.
Penny.
l'm going outto say good-bye
to my entire life.
Penny, l need you here tonight.
Wait a minute.
On this eve, before she's torn
from everything she knows--
kidnapped...
hurled into deep space
against herwill--
whatthoughtsfill the mind
of the daring space captive?
Are there boys on Alpha Prime?
Whatwill l wear?
Whatwill it be like to jettison
your body into deep space?
First...
you'll try holding your breath.
Butyour blood's
already begun to boil.
Then your skin inflates
like a balloon.
Then...pop.
Do they have a name
forwhat's wrong with you?
Dad says don't bring them.
Like anything l do
matters to him.
Don't sweat it, kid.
l got apology videos
fortwo birthdays.
Heforgot lastyear completely.
This mission's the only thing
he cares about anymore.
So that's a no tofamily dinner?
Let's see.
Do l spend my last night
on Earth...
watching Mom and Dad pretend
notto befighting again...
or blow 10 years worth
of allowance atthe mall?
You do the math.
Mom's gonna go thermal.
What's she gonna do,
ground me?
l'm nervous aboutjamming in
a new pilotthe last second.
The Global Sedition
is getting brave.
Firstthe hypergate,
then Daniels.
Nexttime,they may attack
the launch dome.
We can't afford to wait.
Will's sciencefair. Reminder.
Apology videoforWill.
He'll understand.
Ben, listen.
Myfamily is on this mission.
l need a pilotwho's
more than just spit and polish.
l've gotyour man.
He just doesn't know ityet.
At ease, Major.
Why was l pulled
from active duty?
Those gen-techs
may attack again.
l need to be upthere.
Do you know Professor Robinson?
By reputation. Yourfather's
battle strategies...
were required reading
atthe academy.
What can you tell me
aboutthe Jupiter mission?
The Jupiter
is an oversized robot.
Everything's automatic.
Any monkey in aflight suit...
can pilotthat ship
out of the solar system...
and set her down on Alpha Prime.
lt's a baby-sitting job, sir.
No offence.
Major, are you aware Earth's
resources are severely limited?
Every schoolchild knows...
that our recycling technologies
will cure the environment.
Sending afamily
across the galaxy...
is a stuntto sell computers
to people of all ages.
Every schoolchild was lied to.
Recycling technologies
came too late.
Allfossilfuels
are virtually exhausted.
The ozone layer is down to 40%.
ln two decades,the earth will
be unable to support human life.
The new Global Sedition knows
the truth as well as we do.
They're building
their own hypergate.
They hope to colonize
Alpha Primefirst.
If they're successful...
western demons like you and l,
MajorWest...
will be left on Earth to die.
Captain Daniels doesn't have
theflu, does he?
Captain Daniels was murdered
in his apartment last night.
Theflu story is a cover.
lflew with Mike.
We should blasttheir bases!
A decisive strike now!
My squadron is alert status--
Your rescue stuntwasfoolhardy!
l had afriend in trouble.
disobeyed a direct order
because of afriend?
l did...
sir.
He'll do.
Congratulations.
You're the new pilot
of the Jupiter mission.
Where's my money?
The Sedition hired me
to provide access...
to Daniels' apartment
and no more.
My work is done.
Theyfound a replacement pilot.
Our attack
on the hypergatefailed.
How tragicforyou.
We require a more direct
intervention on your part.
l see.
ltwill costyou.
l'm afraid that my price
has just become...
astronomical.
Holograph off.
Come in.
Control hasn't received
results of the pre-flight exams.
The Robinsons
have checked out 100%.
They'refit as afiddle
and ready tofly.
Wish them luck...
for me.
Mission protocols are simple.
Robinson is in command...
unless you encounter
a military emergency.
ln that case, MajorWest,
you are in charge.
l'm afighter pilot.
There must be better candidates.
Hell, even my ownfamily
can't stand me.
Shut up.
JebWalker.
He's an excellentflyer.
He's perfectforthis mission.
Welcome aboard, Major.
Looks like somebody sprung
forthefull-extras package...
on this beauty.
If you have to be a baby-sitter,
it's not such a bad nursery.
Wouldn'tyou agree?
l don't get it.
l can't getthe cryo-sleep
systems up over96%.
Dr Smith approved the specs.
Dr Smith is the base physician.
l am responsible inflight.
These tubes will be perfect,
orthe shipwill not launch.
ls that clear?
Absolutely, Doctor.
Judy, l wantto introduce you
to MajorWest.
He'll be taking Mike's place.
He's heavierthan Mike.
We'll have to recalibrate.
l'd be happy to discuss
my dimensions, Doctor...
say, over dinner?
West.
l've read aboutyou.
You're a war hero, aren'tyou?
Well,yes, actually.
Who was itwho said,
'Those who can'tthink,fight'?
l thinkthat itwas me.
ltwas nice to have metyou.
That's one coldfish
l'd love to thaw.
l'm not gonna make it over
for dinnertonight, Dad.
lt's gonna be a longflight.
Maureen, pick upthe phone,
honey.
l know you're there.
Are you still packing?
l'm just leaving.
Go to bed.
Sweetie?
He wonfirst prize again.
ls this the new model
he's been working on?
Crazy idea he's got about a...
time machine?
Pretty sharp stufffor a midget.
Sorry about dinner.
That new pilot--
John,thefamily needs you here.
This whole thing
is aboutfamily.
My only condition
for accepting this mission...
was thatwe could bring
the children with us...
not leave them behind...
sofuture generations
would have a new home.
You're off saving humanity,
so what does it matter...
thatWill
has to blackout his school...
to get hisfather's attention...
Penny's been dragged home
by security 3 nights in a row...
Judy's become a ghost,
like herfather?
l have to compensate
forthe new launch time.
What do you think l'm doing?
Revising life-science protocols.
l'm also dealing
with two kids...
who are leaving
an entire planet behind.
Sorry, butthere's no manuals
on how to deal with this.
Maybe it doesn't do any good...
saving a world offamilies
if we can't save our own.
ls that it, Professor?
John.
l know, baby.
l'm scared,too.
Med suppliesforthe Jupiter 2?
That's our last crate.
What a mess.
They're nottaking any chances.
Forgive me if lforego the kiss,
my sleeping behemoth...
butthe time has come to awake.
Robot is on-line.
Reviewing primary directives.
One--
preserve the Robinsonfamily.
Two--

Spare me the chatter,
my steely centurion.
Sadly, lfear l havefar more
dire deeds in storeforyou.
Robot is on-line.
Reviewing primary directives.
Sixteen hours into mission,
destroy Robinsonfamily.
Destroy all systems.
That's more like it.
Farewell,
my platinum-plated pal.
Give my regards to oblivion.
Apparently you have completed
your mission on schedule.
l do so admire a spot
of timely terrorism.
l thought l told you
neverto call me here.
The transmission signal
could be traced.
l justwanted to express
my most sincere gratitude...
foryour unflagging loyalty.
Good work, good doctor...
and good-bye.
Jupiter 1 launch
in three minutes.
Mom,just--
Shoot.
Mom, l'mfine.
That's supposed to be there.
This is almost acceptable.
-Mom, don't.
-What?
Vogue says this will be
the style in 10 years.
Can we cut back on her oxygen...
so she's not so annoying
when she wakes up?
Does he have to wake up at all?
That's it. l'm gonna turn
this spaceship around.
Satellite defence net locked
and A-OK.
-Everything's gonna befine.
-30 seconds. Mark.
-Hey there, buddy.
-Com-links encoded and secure.
-Good night, guys.
-Good night.
Here we go.
Artificial gravity at 100%.
You get a 'C'
in paternal expression...
but an 'A' for effort.
-l'm doing the best l can.
-Come here.
You always get an 'A' in this.
Main drive systems on-line.
Sweet dreams.
See you there.
You are at 'T' minus one minute
and counting, MajorWest.
Houston,the bird is hot.
She's all yours.
l'll try to give you
a smooth ride.
Mission control,
this is Dr Robinson.
We are in the green.
Roger, Doctor. You are go
to initiate cryo-stasis.
One question.
ls there room
in these tubesfortwo?
There's barely enough
foryou and your ego.
Don't sweat it, doc.
l do this all the time.
Just drive carefully.
You are at 'T' minus 40 seconds
and counting.
Ready.
You are at 'T' minus
30 seconds and counting.
You are at 'T' minus

The Robinsons are all tucked in.
We are ready tofly.
MajorWest,your escape vector

-Destroy.
-Deactivate safety.
Thatwas a mistake.
Dad!
Mom, let's go!
-Will, stop!
-Destroy.
Destroy Jupiter 2.
Destroy Robinsonfamily.
Look away, baby.
Robot, disable pulse blaster.
Command accepted.
Cancel attack sequence
and stand by.
If thefamily won't come
to the sciencefair...
bring the sciencefair
to thefamily.
Showoff.
Robot.
On-line. Standing by.
Return to docking bay
and power down.
Major,you all right?
Next picnic, no robots.
Where's Judy?
Stabilize the operating systems.
Fire control.
Attempting
containment protocols.
l wantto go home now.
Navigation's down.
System shorts everywhere.
Damn.
Communications are out.
Link upthe secondary system.
-Shunting powerfrom reserve.
-Come on.
Try it now.
Navigational boards are lit.
Can we reroute?
l'm locked out of the helm.
Nothing in computer control.
Main com to manual.
See if she'll respond.
The main subroutine won't open.
l'm gonna try remote ops.
Smith!
Get back!
Get awayfrom me!
Whatthe hell
are you doing here?
MajorWest,
thank God it's you.
l was in here
doing some last minute checks.
Someone hit mefrom behind.
That's Sedition technology.
You're a damn spy.
You did this.
What are you doing?
Throwing outthe trash!
l need help!
l can't getJudy out!
She's dying!
Touch me,
and the girl dies!
l don't deal with dead men.
Kill me, kill the girl.
How much is your revenge worth?
l can save her life...
only if you give me yourword
as an officeryou'll spare mine.
-Help her.
-l've got helm control.
We're way off course.
We're caught in the sun's
gravitational pull.
ls thatwhatthat big ball is?
We've gotfour minutes before
the outer hull begins to melt.
l need you to check
on the thruster alignments.
Professor!
l'll tryforthe Mercury mines.
l'll need Dr Robinson's
portable gurney.
You'llfind it below.
Smith, come on!
You tried to kill myfamily.
We trusted you.
lt's the world behind the world,
Professor Robinson.
Lie once, cheattwice,
and everything becomes clear.
Do not mistake my deception
for a characterflaw.
lt is a philosophical choice...
that l'vefound
in a study of the universe.
lt is a way of life.
You're a monster.
Perhaps,
but l'm also the only one...
who can save Judy's life.
Penny, precious, l wantyou to
shortthe power on my command.
Does he have to call me
precious?
Penny, precious.
Now!
She's not breathing.
Sick bay, move!
The sun won't let us go.
Heat shield breach,
60 seconds.
l need options, Professor.
We have to divert all power
to the engines.
l'm rerouting life sciences.
Rerouting life support.
Engines at80%.
There's no cardiopulmonary
or respiratoryfunctions.
Clear.
Again. Clear.
Alert.
Medical.
Rerouting error.
Systems are crashing.
We're losing her. Do something.
Come on, child.
Put a little heart into it.
The other life l save...
will be my own.
Wake up, baby, please.
That's all the powerwe've got.
l'm putting the pedal
to the metal. Here it goes.
She can't breakfree.
She doesn't have enough thrust.
There's gotto be a way
to getthrough this.
That's it.
lt's working!
What is?
If we can't go around the sun,
we go straightthrough it...
using your hyperdrive.
Engage the hyperdrive
without a gate?
We could be thrown
anywhere in the galaxy.
Anywhere but here.
On my mark.
Three,two, one, initiate.
Hyperdrive at 100%.
Major,you have the com.
Dad? Dad!
Let's see whatthis baby can do.
Maureen, everyone?
-Where is Judy?
-She's OK.
She is,thanks to me.
Here l am.
Either l should cut down
on the liquids...
or l should sew in a newflap
because itwas really hell...
getting out of thatthing.
You're...
Vitals are normal. Pulse
and respiration seem to be.
-Are you OK?
-l'mfine.
Come here.
Will every little problem be an
excuseforfamilial sentiment?
How much, Smith?
Whatwas the price tag
thatyou put on ourfuture?
You can't do it, can you,John?
You can't kill the man
without becoming the monster.
Coward.
What's happened,John?
Where are we?
l bypassed
most of the damaged systems.
We'll have to repairthe rest
manually.
You had me worried, doc.
Nice to see you thawed.
You have a puzzling definition
of a smooth ride.
Computer,
map our current position.
Searching
for recognizable constellations.
This database has star maps
of all the known galaxy.
l don't recognize
a single system.
We're lost....
aren'twe?
Easy, doc. God.
Please.
The cryosuit absorbed
most of the electrical charge.
You're lucky
this wasn'tyour hide.
Doctor, is that concern
l detect in yourvoice?
Great bedside manner.
What's that?
A battle scar?
Sort of.
ltwas a tattoo.
An ex-girIfriend's name,
but l had it removed.
Wouldn't it be easier
to use a magic marker?
Yeah,well,that's me.
A girl in every port.
So, Major, nofamily?
Nothing to tie you down,
no one to miss?
l've never been
thefit-in and play-nice type.
You thinkthat's romantic?
l don't.
Butwhat aboutyou, doc?
ls there some lucky little nerd
you left behind?
l spentthree years working
on this mission.
We're trying to save the planet.
l haven't had timeforfun.
If there's no timeforfun...
then what are we saving
the planetfor?
Here.
Thanks.
l hate being little.
l think it broke.
l'll try andfix it.
Why aren'tyou up on deck
with Mom and Dad?
Have you met our parents?
Good point.
Popcorn, orchids...
waves, Billy...
kissing.
Chocolate.
lt's a list...
of everything we left behind.
Never love anything, kiddo...
'cause you just end up
losing it.
Smith could still hurt us.
Maybe l shouldn't let him live.
But...
How can we bring
civilization to the stars...
if we can't remain civilized?
Right, Professor?
Have you noticed thatyou
take the opposite position...
to whatever l say?
Of course l do.
We're married.
Alert.
Spatial anomaly in progress.
Whatthe hell?
l must be dreaming.
That looks like a ship.
lt appears to be some sort
of hole in space.
Where does it lead?
A reasonable question.
Major,wait.
l'll wait later.
Pull back.
Letthere be light.
Proteus?
She's one of ours, all right.
All right.
l've never seen a ship
like this.
No response to hails.
Scanning all military
and civilianfrequencies.
Nothing.
l'm getting
inconsistent life signs...
butthey may be sensor ghosts.
Computer is still on.
l'll try the standard
docking codes.
Control codes confirmed.
lnitiating docking sequence.
Weird.
What kind of ship is that?
That's not one of ours.
Boys,that's not even human.
If this is all a dream...
why can'tthere be more girls?
As part of her enslavement...
the brave young space captive
Penny Robinson...
isforced to utilize her
dazzling technical expertise.
ldentify yourseIf, soldier.
West, Major,
United Global Space Force...
requesting permission
to see the prisoner.
Proceed, MajorWest.
Could he be cuter?
l don'tthink so.
Breathe, Penny.
Unlock.
These quarters are unacceptable.
We're going to check out
the probe ship.
Maybe we canfigure out how they
got here and how to get home.
Have a wonderful trip.
Putthis on.
You're coming with us.
Out of the question. l am
a doctor, not a space explorer.
Whatyou are
is a murderous saboteur.
l am not leaving you here...
so you can do more harm
than you've already caused.
l absolutely refuse.
Give me an excuse to kill you.
Please?
Blackwas always my colour.
Lock.
Activate standby.
Crush, kill, destroy.
Surprise.
Safety on.
Dad, chill.
lt's OK.
l hacked into his CPU,
and then...
l bypassed
his main operating systems...
and accessed his subroutines.
He's basically just running
on remote control.
l know l haven't been around--
Professor.
We're ready to go.
We'll talk later, son.
Take care of my dad.
OK, Robot?
Vacuum check complete.
Oxygen levels are normal.
Microbe scans are negative.
Clear.
The air is stale, old.
That's the smell of ghosts.
l've got
her on-board computer up.
Notworking?
She's working, all right.
Just--l don't know.
Too damnfast.
Dad, do you hear something?
Like the drip, drip of blood.
You really need to shut up.
Here.
This matter appears biological.
Nothing good will come of this.
You, of course, being the expert
on space exploration.
Let's go.
Trust me, Major.
Evil knows evil.
Motion sensors
are still working.
This way.
Rambler-crane series robots.
But like no design
l've ever seen.
Well,well.
Aren'twe the poor cousin?
Down here.
lt's a remote op station.
Come on, Dr Smith.
Could this ship be a prototype?
Looks like some kind
offirefight.
Captain's log is degraded.
Maybe l can gather
somefragments.
Sorry.
The hyperspace tracker seems
to befunctioning normally...
butwe cannot process
all the data.
There is no sign
of the Jupiter 2.
l have exceeded my timetable.
When did he make Major?
l wantthis on the record.
l am notwilling to give up.
Don would keep lookingfor me.
That's it. The rest
of the data's totally corrupted.
How could they launch
a rescue missionfor us...
when we've only been lost a day?
There's no data
on the alien ship...
butthey brought in something
thatwas attached to its hull.
Got it.
Some sort of egg sac?
Get back here!
Be happy to oblige...
although l don'tthink it's me
you should be worrying about...
but ratherthese.
l'm detecting motion.
Behind you.
After it. Move!
Bring Smith.
Don't even think about it.
Hydroponics.
Growth like this
would take decades.
Unhand me,you mechanical moron.
Don't move.
Easy.
Easy there, buddy.
No one's gonna hurtyou.
Easy.
Relax.
Excellent.
Looks like you made afriend.
Still, l'd wait afew weeks...
before tattooing
her name on your arm.
Do yourseIf afavour.
Don't evolve.
Charming.
The Dr Dolittle of outer space.
This could be a creature
from that alien ship.
Butthis guy's no pilot.
He looks like a child.
Try it now.
Strange.
The scales are giving off heat.
l've tapped into
the internal sensor array.
There's no other
animate life present.
Besides us,
this ship is totally deserted.
A ghost ship.
Theflavour of the day
is banana beef.
Who thinks up
these combinations?
Good.
MajorWest, l highly
recommend you never breed.
That, by the way,
is my medical opinion.
Little thing was hungry.
l've gottheir star maps
on-line.
Here we go.
More systems
than l've ever seen.
Finding a route to Alpha Prime.
Downloading to Jupiter.
l don't like the sound
of that sound.
They're moving.
Getthis infernal...
creature off me!
Come here.
John, getthe hell out of there.
Mom says,
'Getthe hell out of there.'
Evacuate.
Now!
The controls are too slow.
Activate holographic interface.
Holographic interface, on-line.
They eattheirwounded.
Seal the bulkhead.
Codes are locked.
Duck.
Emergency bulkhead.
Fire sensor activated.
Emergency bulkhead closure.
Stop!
We have to getthat door open.
Open, damn you!
Get out of here.
What is with me
and these damn doors?
l can't override
thefire protocol!
A million bucks
worth of weaponry...
and l'd trade it all back...
for a lousy...
can of Raid.
Stand clear.
Get moving! Go!
Come on!
Maureen...
can you get me anything?
Cycling through a vacuum check.
l'm overriding.
No way it's that easy.
Run!
Run! Get back!
Get backto the ship!
Move!
Got it. Try it now.
Mom says, 'Try it now.'
Can we save it?
Can'twithout letting
the spiders into the ship.
Leave him behind!
That spider scratched me!
Stop laughing,you little worm.
Good-bye, Robot.
You couldn't save him, kid.
Save him? Of course.
What are you trying to do?
Prepare to disengage!
This is afun picnic.
Firstyellow aliens,
now giant spiders.
The crowd goes wild.
Recall your childhood
nightmares, Major.
Monsters are rarely
so easily dissuaded.
Why don'tyou talkto them,
bug to bug?
l think
they'd rather come inside.
Arming torpedoes.
Fire in the hole.
Alert. Detonationfailure.
The robot must have damaged
the detonator cores.
They won't blow.
Alert.
Outer hub has been compromised.
DNA extrapolation coming up.
Silicone-based, mantium shell,
lack of respiratory system.
Means they do live
in deep space.
Tinyfront brain implies
communal relationships.
Like bees.
If the biology lesson is over,
l could use some help.
They may be attracted
to heat and light.
lnner hull breach in 15 seconds.
l'm bringing the Proteus
fusion drives on-line.
lt's working.
Let's turn upthe heat.
What are you doing?
Never leave an enemy stronghold
intact.
Stop!
That's one of yourfather's
first rules of engagement.
That is a direct order.
l hate spiders.
That's comingfast.
Get into the harnesses now.
Manual helm, engage.
-Children, secure?
-Secure.
l'm in.
Pull up.
Really? No kidding.
Thanks.
Coming in too hot.
l'll try and slow us down.
Hang on!
Everybody by the numbers.
Life sciences,
still breathing.
Video mechanics...
OK.
Mission medical, l'm alive.
Me,too.
Robotics, l mean.
l'm alive...
MajorWest's poor excusefor
piloting skills notwithstanding.
Oh, Dorothy.
Back in Kansas at last.
You violated a direct order.
About haIf the core
material's burned out.
We'll never generate
enough powerto break orbit.
We can get off the ground...
but getting back into space
is another story.
l ordered you notto blow
that ship's reactors.
Life support is marginal.
lt's gonna get cold in here
tonight.
Also,the pod and the chariot
are pretty much scrap metal.
Don'tyou walk awayfrom me
when l'm talking to you.
Give it a rest, Professor.
l was technically
still in command.
l am commander of this mission.
Look, no offence...
butyou're an egghead
with an honorary rank.
No one ever intendedforyou
to handle combat situations.
You handled it brilliantly,
sending us crashing down here.
Those aliens posed
a continuing threat.
l made a judgement call...
and, if l have to,
l'll make it again.
You of all people
should understand that.
Yourfatherwould back me up.
Myfather is dead...
killed in one of those combat
missions you admire so much.
Myfamily is on this ship,
and you willfollow my orders...
whetheryou agree with them
or not. ls that clear?
Save your speeches.
l like you, but l'm gonna
do whatever ittakes...
to ensure the success
of this mission...
with orwithoutyour help.
ls that clear?
Am l interrupting something?
No, really.
l thinkyou two
should slug it out.
Here we are,
stranded on an alien world...
and you want
to get into a pissing contest?
Please, gofor it.
l'll have Judy down here
to declare you both unfit...
and l'll take overthis mission.
l don'twantto hear another
wordfrom you. ls that clear?
Not...anotherword.
Better.
If you'vefinished hosing down
the decks with testosterone...
l suggestyou come with me.
l may havefound a way
off this planet.
Tell me about it.
Damn bug bite.
She...
She really is an interesting
specimen. Huh, doc?
She'sfascinating.
The retinal aperture dilation...
seems directly linked
to the skin pigmentation.
What?
Can l keep her?
She's notjust anotherfad
you can pick up and throw away.
Oh, please.
She's all alone here, and
l promise l'll look outfor her.
l promise.
She kind of needs me.
The minute you misplace her,
youforgettofeed her--
Don't smile. l mean it, Pen.
Thanks...doc.
We're both a long wayfrom home,
aren'twe, little one?
Blarp?
That's whatwe'll call you--
Blarp.
Nice girl.
Pretty girl.
Nice.
The atmosphere here
can sustain human life.
l've located 500 rads
of radioactive material...
five miles west.
We'll need at leastthat much to
getthe corefunctioning again.
We start out at daybreak.
Be saferthatway.
Those are my orders.
l agree
with your recommendation.
Détente's a beautiful thing.
lt's nice to see youfound
a cornerto suityourtalents.
Turn down the bed
before you leave.
l gave my word l'd letyou live.
l never saidfor how long.
Family hour is over.
We're dying here.
Robinson is out of his league.
Look into his eyes and tell me
you can't see hisfear.
lfought in the millennial wars.
Survival is a soldier's game.
We both know this civilianfool
will lead us straightto hell.
Robinson needs our help,
if he wants it or not.
With minimalforce,
we could take this ship...
and assure them we shall
continue atyour command.
Of course.
My God...
you're right.
How could l have been so blind?
l'll just run and getyou a gun
so we can hijackthe ship, OK?
Sarcasm is the recourse
of the weak mind.
l'm hiding the pain.
Really.
Lock.
Your pain...
has just begun.
Starlight, star bright.
A million strange stars,
and only one wish.
l wish we were home.
Never seen a sky look so alien.
We really are lost,
aren'twe?
When thefirst sailors
circled the globe...
saw a brand-new sky...
they thoughtthey'd sailed
off the edge of the earth...
butthey were really
just around the corner.
You're saying we should
just billow our sails...
and letthe wind take us home?
ls that it?
Those sailors...
foundfamiliar shapes...
in the stars...
to make the sky seem
morefriendly...
and to helpthem
find theirway home.
That's how the constellations
were born.
Porky,the wise and mighty pig.
The great...
big-eared bunny Bugs.
The way you got us down here,
thatwas prettyflying.
My quarters oryours?
Excuse me?
Don't play coy.
We're the only single people
of consenting age in the galaxy.
How much more of a set-up
do you need?
So youfigure,why not dispense
with the pleasantries...
and get down to business?
You have a way with words.
Do you wantto show me
how you handle the helm?
Right here on this console?
Right here would befine.
Why don'tyou just hang on
to yourjoystick?
Excellenttechnique, Major.
Really.
Will was lookingforyou.
l sent him backto his room.
He's decided
he can rebuild the robot.
He wants to stay up all night
and show me his designs.
Funny creatures, men.
Try so hard notto be
theirfathers...
end up making the same mistakes.
We can't get off this planet,
let alone get back on course.
l don't have time.
Just listen to him.
lt doesn't matterwhat he says.
Just listen.
Sometimes--especially
in the eyes of theirfathers--
little boys have to comefirst.
As soon as
we get back up into space...
we'll spend a lot of time
together, l promise.
lt's nice having your
wholefamily under one roof.
Even if we did have to go...
haIfway across the galaxy
to manage it.
Good night,John.
Good night, Maureen.
Good night,Judy.
Good night,Will.
Good night, Penny.
You guys have gotto be kidding.
Good morning,Will Robinson.
Solar panels are charged.
The radioactive material
we needforthe core...
is in the centre of that bubble.
l was afraid of this.
OK, everybody,
let's get settled now.
l thinkthis 'bubble'
outthere...
is exactly the same thing
we passed through in space.
Both of them are opening
and closing doorways.
Doorways to where?
Doorways in...time.
You can't be serious.
Time travel is impossible.
lt's not.
Just improbable.
What if we crossed
into a time...
years after Earth
sent a rescue mission?
Perhaps the professor
hit his head when we landed.
Think about it.
The way the Proteus
seemed desertedfor so long.
Yourfriend looking so old.
So if we walk
inside that bubble...
we could be walking
further into thefuture.
Dad,what if the doorways
aren't natural?
This kind of phenomenon could
only be produced naturally.
That bubble's
the kind of side effect...
l predicted my time machine
would do.
What if someone built a device--
Son...
l appreciate your input...
but now is notthe time
forflights offancy.
You never listen to me.
Not ever.
This time bubble could be
causing these earthquakes.
No telling how long before
this planet breaks up entirely.
The major and l
are going to locate...
the radioactive material
forthe core.
We may have very little time.
l'm leaving now.
That's a surprise.
You're the most importantthing
in the world to me.
One day, l hope you'll
be able to understand that.
What if...
one time you don't come home?
Wheneveryour grandfather
went on a mission...
he'd leave these with me
for safekeeping.
When he came home,
l would always be there...
waiting to give them back.
l'm coming back.
l promise.
Listen...
about last night...
Go on. You can do it.
l'm sorry.
See,thatwasn't so difficult.
Like pulling steel needles
through my cheeks.
Then you understand
what saying thisfeels like.
Try to come back in one piece.
Listen, doc, l'm...
l'm thinking this is your basic
'kissfor luck' occasion.
Wouldn'tyou agree?
Thinking.
lt's not really
your strong suit, is it?
l've got afix
on the radioactive material.
Thatwas scientific.
Scared?
There's an alloy
in this craterwall...
that's disabling the com-links.
You're not going to be able
to communicate with the ship.
Come home to me, Professor.
l love you,wife.
Come here, squirt.
Nice girl.
Pretty girl. Nice.
lt's OK.
You're still in one piece.
Come on.
Can you hear me, Robot?
Hello?
Systems error!
Robot unable to locate
motor controls!
Unable to--
Calm down.
What is happening to me?
l didn't have enough time
tofinish the download.
Warning!
Penny, give it back!
My circuits are unbalanced.
So l had tofinish you off
with another personality.
l put my mind inside of yours.
That explains
this warmfuzzyfeeling...
when l think about baseball.
Strike! You're out!
Butthis does not compute.
What?
Robottried to destroy
the Robinsonfamily.
Why did Will Robinson
save Robot's personality?
l guess sometimesfriendship
means listening to your heart...
notyour head.
Putthat in your memory bank.
Don'tworry.
l'm gonna build you a new body.
Mom always said l should
try to make newfriends.
l need a microsealer.
l got it.
After much deliberation...
the space captive
hasfinally decided...
to accept her new role
as a member of the crew.
The Robinsons, after all,
can obviously use her help.
Blarp, come back here.
Theoretically,
thisfuture would befixed...
unchanged by whatwe do
or did in the past--
Why don'tyou give
the old egghead a rest?
Out here we gottwo moons,
a craterthe size of Miami...
and thatwould be
one great climb.
Myfatherwould have liked you.
What's that?
This metal's decades old.
What kind of a nightmare
is this?
Where the hell are we?
The question is,
when the hell are we?
l will tell you a joke.
Why did the robot
cross the road?
Because he was carbon-bonded
to the chicken.
We have a lot of workto do.
That sounds like old Morse code.
What does it say?
'Danger,
Will Robinson, danger.'
William. Come in.
Unlock.
You said someone was in danger.
We all are.
You are wise to arm yourseIf.
This gun is settofire
for me only...
so don'ttry anythingfunny.
Lock.
You misjudge me.
l only wantto helpyou.
Help us?
You tried to kill us.
But now ourfates
are intertwined.
If yourfather
and that idiotWestfail...
l have no chance
of getting home.
lt's in my best interests
thatthey succeed...
and l alwaysfollow
my best interests.
What monsters roam
these alien wilds?
They'refools!
To set off blindly
across this savage land.
Much as l hate to admit it...
itwill be much harder
withoutthem.
What are you talking about?
They'll be back.
They'll be OK.
Will they?
Someone should go afterthem.
Unlock.
lforbid it. You're a boy.
A clever one,
but a child nonetheless.
This planet
is likelyfull of predators.
Even if youfound them,
what if they're hurt? Ravaged?
Dying?
What good could you do?
You can helpthem.
You're a doctor.
l'm a doctor.
We made it.
Mom didn't see us.
That'sfantastic.
l told you we could get
into the bubble this way.
The bubble's growing!
Run, child!
Cool.
Wait!
Come on.
We can always go back.
lt's just like stepping
between two rooms.
l can barely contain my glee.
Dad's signal is...
this way.
l loathe children.
Billy...kissing...
hotwings, orchids, corn.
Waves...Billy...
popcorn with...kissing...
What did youfind?
Come on.
No time to dawdle.
Let's move along.
Follow yourfather's signal.
Come on.
All things really do come
to he who waits.
What is this place?
The shock must have
scrambled your brain.
Take a look around.
Don'tyou recognize this spot?
You're home.
This can't be.
What have you done to the ship?
Where is myfamily?
What chance do you think
yourfamily had withoutyou?
Afew spiders survived
the destruction of the Proteus.
They reached this planet and...
l can still hear
the women scream.
Who are you?
You don't recognize me?
l'm your son Will.
Dad's signal
is just overthis ridge.
Be still, myfoolish heart.
Shit.
A boy of your intelligence
should never swear.
Shit.
lndeed.
Look, Father...
what myflights offancy
have wrought.
l used your hyper engine
to build my time machine.
OK, Robot, put him down.
Affirmative.
Where are we?
l thinkthe Jupiter 2,
but in a differentfuture.
Father?
Once this core material...
isfully introduced
into the control console...
Core material.
If we could getthat
backto ourJupiter...
l will open a doorway
stable enough...
for one person to take
one tripthrough time...
and space as well.
Commence proto-generation.
Cool, huh?
Today, l will change history.
l'm gonna go backto that day
you dragged us into space.
l'll stopthe ship
from taking off.
l'll save thefamily.
Earth, October 1, 2058.
Target lock confirmed.
Excellent.
Son...
Look around.
Theforce of yourtime machine
is ripping this planet apart.
These violent distortions
in time...
are being caused
by your experiment.
What if it has the same effect
on Earth?
What if, in getting home...
you destroy Earth
in the process?
l know you mean well.
l'm going home.
l'm going to save thefamily.
You've gotto listen to me.
l'm yourfather!
Myfather?
Let me tell you about myfather.
l'll neverforget
that morning 20 years ago.
Whatwas ityou said?
'l'm coming back.
l promise.'
You promised...
and you never came home.
Myfather's not
coming to the rescue.
What do you thinkyou're doing,
young man?
Let me tell you about life.
Around every corner,
monsters wait.
l know. l am one.
We monsters have nofear
in devouring little boys.
To survive,you must be
fully prepared to kill.
l can do it.
Can you?
Listen to me, my child...
l've crossed this world
with you...
risked my life,
but l would notthrow it away.
Who knows what dangers
lie ahead?
You can't protect us.
l can.
l will.
Gimme the gun.
Enable gunfor all users.
Voiceprint confirmed.
A brief lesson in survival
on this world or any other--
nevertrust anyone.
Especially me.
lt's almosttime.
l hope itworks.
Neverfear...
Smith is here.
Don't move,
Professor Robinson...
orthis peculiarfamily reunion
will be tragically brief.
l'll askyou
to step awayfrom that.
lt's a time machine,
you idiot.
l had hoped to take over
the shipwith this.
One of life's little ironies.
Let's try this dance again.
You are the puppet,
l am the puppeteer.
Do try to get it right
this time.
Robot,you will respond
to my voice alone.
Affirmative.
We need electric disrupters.
That's good, gargantuan.
You did it.
Just like l imagined.
You linked
the dimensional sifter...
to the navigational array.
That's how it can be in
the same place atthe same time.
Butthe spatial delivery system,
the targeting laser...
l neverthought of those.
Thefuture is neverwhat
it seems like when you're 10.
Say good-bye to your past!
Yourfuture lies with me.
l'm going home in your place.
What are you grinning at?
Look around you...
atthis hostile world.
Do you think a boy
could have survived all alone?
Neverfear...
Smith is here.
lt's Dr Smith.
Hello.
How nice to see me again
after all these years.
Confused?
Have l changed?
The spider's sting had some
unexpected side effects.
My unique gifts
gave me an advantage...
in this quarrelsome world.
Afterthe women were savaged...
l became thefather
Will never had.
Two decades of agony taught me
the error of my ways.
Butyou,your crude ambition
fills me with seIf-loathing.
You see,
l have looked within me...
and what l see is you!
l never liked me anyway.
Robot, kill them all.
Wait.
Dr Smith, please.
Don't.
Very well.
Robot,take them inside
and keepthem there.
If they move...
then kill them.
Proceed or be destroyed.
Nothing works.
l'll draw hisfire,
you grabWill and get out.
Halt!
Stop!
Do you remember me?
Do you rememberwhat l
taughtyou aboutfriendship?
l need you to help us now,
because we'refriends.
Logic error.
Friendship does not compute.
Forget logic.
Actwith your heart.
Robot has no heart.
Robot is powered by
afusion pulse generator.
Every living thing has a heart.
My programming has been modified
to remove all emotion.
Any attempts to override
command protocols...
may result infusing
my neural net.
Please, Robot?
If you don't let us go,
we're all gonna die.
l'm asking you now,
will you help us?
Will you be myfriend?
Robot attempting
to deactivate control bolt.
-Commands overridden!
-Do it!
Destroy Robinsonfamily!
Destroy!
You did it.
Robotwill save Will Robinson.
Robotwill save hisfriend.
Where are they?
Wait here.
Withoutthat core...
l can't promise
we'll get off this rock.
See if you can make it
backto ourJupiter.
l'll getthe core material
and meetyou there.
We don't have the trackers
tofind ourway back.
Thefamily needs theirfather.
The crew needs their pilot.
l can'tfly the ship
as well as you can.
You're their best chance
to survive.
Listen to me.
l know you neverwanted
to take this job.
l thinkyou're going to turn out
to be a grade-A baby-sitter.
So...
the camper's all yours now.
Take care of them.
Good luck.
-Dad!
-Professor!
Rememberthe space spiders
in the Proteus?
They're not going to be able
to get back.
Enable all missiles.
Butthe warheads don'twork.
Just do it.
Look!
Damn, he's still breathing.
Fire in the hole.
So these sailors,
they drew shapes in the sky...
Look! lt's aflare!
...to helpthem
find theirway home.
Danger,Will Robinson!
Climb on! Hurry!
Field dampeners on-line.
Portal compression commenced.
Tell me again, old monster,
how did the girls die?
We've been overthis before,
son.
ln all the years since...
the spiders
have never resurfaced.
Why?
Let'sforgetthe past.
Portal aperture reduction, 50%.
Careful, child!
The plasma around the portal...
will rip a man into pieces!
Haven'tyou made the doorway...
too small?
Notfor me.
Butthen l'm not going, am l?
Spiders didn't kill the girls.
ltwas you.
l just never let myseIf see it.
You kept me alive
because you needed me.
Because l could
build thisforyou.
Poor boy.
Did you really think
l would letyou go home?
Let all that l have become
vanish?
Look at me!
l am no mere man!
l...am...a...god!
Within these egg sacs
grow the seeds...
of a master race of spiders.
We shall descend upon
helpless Earth...
an entire planetto rule!
An entire planet
on which tofeed!
Time to die...son.
l'm notyour son.
Good-bye.
Myfather once said...
'Evil alwaysfinds
its trueform.'
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.
You were right.
l couldn't kill the man...
but l can kill the monster!
Spare me
thefury of the righteous.
l thinkthere's timefor a snack
before my trip.
The pain.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
Rememberthe Proteus?
These monsters
eattheirwounded.
Take all the time you want
to die!
Wake up, son!
Dad?
Core material insertion
complete.
All table run--2058.
Mission control.
You could've taken the core
and left before itwas too late.
l couldn't letyoufall.
You're my boy.
Mom! lt's them.
Hi, Mom!
You all right?
You're not as dumb as you look.
l'm gonna getyour name
tattooed right here.
Greetings.
Where's John?
The bubble closed behind us.
ltwas his only way back.
l'm sorry.
We've already begun
the pre-flight countdown.
l'm going to save
as many lives as l can.
l kept hoping somehow
he'd make it back.
Let's go, Major.
Good-bye, my love.
Engaging primary thrusters now.
Look. He made it.
Go.
We're not getting any altitude.
We don't have enough power.
l'm sorry.
l couldn't save them.
So many years ago.
l can stillfeel it--
our sun...
our Earth.
lt's all l thought about--
going home.
A long time ago,
you told a small boy...
that one day he'd understand
how much hisfather loved him.
l could never see
how much you cared...
until now.
Come.
Let's go.
l kept hoping he'd make it back.
Good-bye, my love.
Look!
Don't make me wait another
lifetime to know how youfeel.
Dad!
Dad, itworked!
Come with us!
l can't.
Only enough powerfor
one person, one trip, remember?
lt's good to see you again, Mom.
lt's good to see you all.
Take care of them,Will.
Don'tforget me.
He sacrificed everything
for hisfamily.
l'm glad you came back.
l justwantyou to know
l love you.
l love you very much.
The planet
is breaking up around us.
We're doomed!
Boy,thatfelt good.
Get us airborne.
l'm going to try
to reach escape velocity.
We don't have the core material.
The gravity wells
will pull us back down.
We might be able to--
We won't make it. l know.
We have to go...
down--
through the planet
as she's breaking up.
We can use
the planet's gravity...
What?
to throw us outthe other side
and back into space.
That's insane.
l don't have time to argue.
That's a direct order.
Yes, sir, Commander.
This should be interesting.
l see it.
Full burn.
Stop!
-Right!
-Left!
Let me drive.
All right, everybody,
hold your noses.
Rock and roll.
Amazing.
Nice work,flyboy.
l earn that kiss yet?
You earn this.
This one's on credit.
Coldfish, huh?
There you are. Come here.
Where have you been,
you little creep?
-Little creep?
-Oh, great.
Warning, MajorWest.
My sensors indicate
we have a problem.
The planet's gravityfield
is collapsing.
We'll be sucked in.
No way to get clear in time.
The hyperdrive.
l'm accessing
the Proteus star maps.
Here we go again.
Targeting Alpha Prime...
l hope.
lnitiate...now.
