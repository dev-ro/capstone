So, references..
Well.. leaving that stool at the front door
is always a good sign.
I hate this.
- Hey, it's gonna be fine, just like always
4 minutes, no more.
Watch the clock.
Safety's off.
I love you.
- I love you too.
Lock the doors, I'll be right back.
Just honk if you see anything.
No..noo!
No!.. Noooo!
Where are we?
Hey Henson, give me the map.
Huh?
- Map, give me the map.
I got it.
Need help?
- Yeah no. I got it. I'm fine
I'm allright.
Hang in there.
Alright.
How you doing?
- I'm fine.
You?
I think if we passed through winchestru,
we can go..
We're headed south, using route two
for averaging 20 miles a day..
20 miles? You think we could do 20 miles a day?
Oh we can start marching then.
Look this, somewhere around this then.
In this shit.
Oh what am i missing?
- You're eh? Here we go, look..
this small bridge, about 5 miles west of here.
Over those hills, in the river bank paralel.
Rocky terrain, provide protection
and river as the water source.
It's a perfect place for them.
Oh yeah, we should go there.
- Its a perfect place.
Quiet.
Let's go.
This is fucking bullshit.
There's nowhere in hell between this,
is a bad idea.
What were you thinking?
What am i thinking?
Okay.
Those storm clouds are coming back.
I'm worried about handsing gang south.
Your fucking brain damage, man.
You can't even stand.
- Brian.
We're pouring ourself.
- Yeah well this is not about us, Adam.
Fucking Rick.
- Adam, please stop.
Oh so I don't get to say.
- Enough already.
No tracks.
It's restore.
Let's go, Kate.
That's a basement.
You wanna shoot or goes down first?
Flashlight.
Anything?
- Clear.
Relax, Ok?
Relax.
Oh man, do I get a bedtime story too?
- Oh, should I?
Once upon a time,
there was an idiot called Henson..
Look, i dont like this place at all.
It seems like no one has been in
or around here for a long time. Which is good.
So we rest. We stay dry.
We get the hell out.
As soon as the rain lets up.
Inventory!
Well, I'm still nine.
Fifteen.
I have 8 and 3.
Oh, that is hot.
Kate?
Only 6.
41 rounds total.
Not too good.
How are my babies?
Its true you give away two cream for those seeds.
Next you'll be naming it.
- I already have.
Hope. Faith.
My god.. you serious aren't you?
Holy shit, what is this dude tryin to get?
Mock if you will, but this are our future.
Once we find a nice place..
- Jesus christ, Rick.
Can you help me? Not today!?
Adam.
Adam, hold on.
So what's cookin?
This is the last of the dry rabbit that we retrieved before.
And we got two more of this moistbeef sucker left.
Thats it.
Guys, we need to find more food.
No we dont. This is why we got Henson, huh?
We're just going to eat you.
I think we're just going to eat your chubby cheeks.
What are you thinking up there?
I'm sorry.
Hey Adam.
Do you think Susie is dead?
Susan Macudes from highschool?
Is something about her?
No.
Remember, uh, remember Jenny blake?
Oh shit! Remember that?
Of course.
It feels like years ago now.
It was.
You think she's dead? You think Susan is dead?
All this people? All of our friends?
Do I think they're dead?
- Yeah, it's just like that ..
I thought you know they're dead.
You know she was nice.
She had those..
Susan was a bitch to you Rick.
Everybody knew that but you.
She was a bicth.
Thank you.
You know.. it's weird.
Thinking about..
- Then don't.
I'm so tired of running.
Why cant we just put the goddamn seeds
and the grain here.
What if they come?
- What if they don't?
Make a wish. I know, it's okay.
I know, it's ok.
There's nothing in any of those.
Nice stay out?
Why don't you go in there?
We're celebrating.
I know.
Might as well be today.
I know everybody's prety much lost somebody..
Dont!
I just.. need to know.
I just wait to die.. ok?
Yeah..
We shouldn't stay here.
Yeah.
It's time to get the hell out of here.
Oh, get this off me.
Hey, Henson get some water.
- Shit.
C'mon.
- Oh thanks, man.
Are you alright?
Oh brother from this hot..
I'm worse when I come first though..
We have to get the fuck out of here.
- Yeah buddy.
Alright.. here, can you shut this thing up?
We've been here too long.
We have to start moving.
But he's not going anywhere.
He look terrible. Sorry baby, but you do.
- Those guys are clear, we've got to go.
Do you hear what I said?
He can't even barely stand up.
What are you gonna do? Leave me here?
- We're sitting ducks right now, we've got  to go.
Adam, stop.
Alright?
Jesus, he can't move no matter he stay on.
Hey, I can manage. Let's go.
- That's right, he can manage.
Baby, its not at the speed that you need to.
We stay the night. When was the last time
we had a roof over our head anyway.
Hey, we have a protocol right?
Right. Now whats more important right now, Adam? Hope..
- Oh dont give me that bullshit.
We've got to go. And we've got to go right now.
There's no discussion.
We stay, until Henson is strong enough again.
We'll make use of the light.
Adam and I will salvage what we can from the house.
Ladies, your on traffic duty.
This is pointless and you know it.
- Its not pointless.
You ok, man?
Yeah, I'm alright.
You got anything more to say, now its the time.
Hey man I already say it.
We both agree it was your call.
But this, isn't about that, is it?
Hello?
- Yep, I'm listening.
Rick, come here.
Oh my god.
Can you at least try pretending with the tracks.
You know what.. don't get me wrong,
you can definetly handle yourself with that thing.
But since you hook up with us,
you barely said a word.
Those three guys back there, they grew up together.
Thats how they manage to stay tight through this shit.
And I've been riding with them since,
I don't know, back when we're twelve maybe.
Now I get it that you're into this lonewolf thing.
Thats fine.
But maybe it would help over our morale
if you just unobjective yourself just once in a while.
Said something, anything..
I mean 'what is going on?'
We are family.
Other be part of it, or don't.
Do you understand?
Thats what I thought.
What the fuck is this?
Hope.. and faith.
Henson, you've got to come and take a look at this.
Aren't I supposed to be rested?
Hurry up.
Really?
The dirty-ass basement?
I hate fuckin surprise.
Dont fuckin suprise me.
- Oh, you'll like surprises.
What've you got?
- Surprise!
Oh.. fuck me man!
We got food!
Oh, we got a lot!
- We got beef..
What do you.. what do you like?
- I like it all.
Let's do it.
You alright?
- Yeah.
Strong enough to carry this with yours?
- Whatever I carry, I eat it.
That's the spirit.
Plenty to go around!
There's many of this too..
- Fuck this I'm hungry, I'm not waiting alright?
I gotta tell you,
I think stay here was a good call.
What is this?
Rocks?
Rick! Rick!
No! Nooo!
Oh shit! Noooo!
What the fuck is that?
Henson!
What happened?
What the fuck is that ringing?
Are there more?
They will be.
I can't get out.
Henson!
Henson, I need you!
Adam, we're lock in!
Ok. It's ok.
Henson, come here.
He can't breath.
Oh fuck it.
- God.
He's gone.
- No.
Rick? Adam?
Guys?
- Help! Help!
Open this!
Shit!
Guys, can you hear me?
- Fuck.
Adam?
- Yes, we're here.
What? I can't hear you.
Is Rick ok?
- He's not ok. He's dead.
Let me out!
- Fuck!
I need your help. Get up here Adam.
- Fuck.
Shit!
Hey! Hey Shanon!
- Huh?
..making some of the leverage
that will open the door.
- I can't find anything. There's nothing here.
You've got to hurry out of this thing.
Its gonna be fucking real.
Shanon! Shanon!
You gotta go ok?
You've got to go right now!
I'm not gonna leave you here.
We can't be here when they come.
- Fuck you!
Go save your own fuckin skin!
They're my family.
I'll kill every last one of them my self if i have to.
No, you'll die..quickly.
I'm not scared.
Let's asume there are dozen more
of this places spread all over this countryside.
The bell is a signal.
The way it tells someone about the traps.
Scouts?
- Right.
We can handle this.
Stay with me.
- Ok.
They can't do it.
They will.
Wait for it.
Hello meat.
- Fuck you. How is it going.
Relax.
- Fuck you. You relax.
What don't you got hot one in your head right now?
- I'm not even sure you have balls.
We got some cookin for your ass.
Come down here so i can bust your fuckin ass.
Come down here. All of you.
Come down!
Kitchen clear.
- Fuck you come join the party, bitch!
Upstair clear.
Is he dead?
- Fuck you!
Give me your friend.
- Hey fuck you!
Just give me your friend.
We'll catch you guys another time.
- Look I got another offer for you asshole.
Why dont you guys walk out
and suck off each other dick tonight.
That's what you do.
We're all the same, you know?
You all think you're different. You're not.
You just dying faster than we are.
Fuck you shut up.
Fine. Have it your way.
We got supplies.
We can wait for days.
For hours by the look of you.
- No. Fuck waiting, come down here!
Come down I'll bust your fuckin ass.
Fuck this motherfucker man.
Come on you ready, bitch?
Mary!
You certainly a pretty beast.
I see.
I see you!
You think you can use our place?
Our place!
To trap all this meat..
and not share.
Greedy!
We'll be back. Soon.
To take what's ours.
You okay?
- Riffle, now!
You guys alright?
Daddy.
I tell you what.
Let's go get the others.
Come on.
Get on.
Everybody gather up.
We need to talk.
Fuck it.
Smoke her and lets get out of here.
There's gotta be more of them coming.
- No, just wait. Wait a minute.
Who the fuck are you?
I know who she is.
You're one of them, isn't that right?
This whole fuckin time.
Is it true?
Are you one of them?
Yes.
Let her said it.
Is that fucking right?
We dont have time for this shit.
She's one of them and I'll prove it to you.
Just shoot her if she tries anything.
Where is it? Huh?
There it is.
Is that your mark?
So allies to her clan wont touch her, but cleverly hidden it
so you can infiltrate people like us.
You piece of shit!
Did you bring us here on purpose?
Did you fuckin bring us into this trap?
Fuck yes she did.
Buy them a fucking time too, didn't you?
That's for Rick, you cunt.
I can't believe she..
I don't believe it.
Why does she kill all those other huh?
If she's one of them. Why would she do that?
It's just what that sick fuck said.
She wanted us for herself.
I don't know. I don't think there's any
common loyalty between those fucks.
They and her clan, they've been
fucking hunt and eat just the same.
Isn't that right sweetheart?
You can jump in anytime.
Why didn't she kill us fuckin weeks ago.
Don't you think she won't do that?
I don't fuckin know Henson.
Just fuckin kill her and lets get the hell out of here.
You helped us. Why?
Huh? Why?
Say something.
Ok.
Just fuckin say something.
Adam.
Adam, just finish her off already.
Adam. Come on.
No.
- Just finish it.
Not so quickly. Not mercifull.
No mercy.
Goddamnit Adam.
Please, lets go man.
We have time for this.
- No, we dont have time..
We have time for this!
No, we fuckin dont have time.
Let's get the fuck out of here. C'mon.
I see now you hungry.
You don't kill her quickly.
It makes you forget why she came
so you can't process her properly.
It's easier.
It's clean and more efficient.
Isn't that what you did
to my wife and daughter?
Did you make them look?
Come on Adam, let's get out of here.
- Hey, go ahead if you want.
It's already too fuckin late.
They're already on their way.
There's nothing around here for miles.
They track us less than a day. You're already dead.
No.
Just no. With little time I have left,
I want to spend it with you.
Ok?
How did you kill them?
Isn't that it used to be with gauge just like pork.
Did you tortured them?
Did you pack them with onion?
Did you cut her before you cook her?
Is that what you did?
It's just crazy..
But you're one of them, so you're responsible.
You choose to be with them.
You choose to do it.
I choose to live.
No.
You choose to murder.
Come on.
Goddamnit Adam, that's enough.
No, please ...
C'mon baby..
You used to love this..
Adam, what are you doing man.
- Open up here please..
Open up.
Open your fuckin mouth!
Adam, just get on with it.
Shit.
Let see here.
Want some more appetizing huh?
Have you ever wonder
what your heart looks like?
Yes!
Yes! Yes!
Yes, fucking kill me.
Kill me, please.
Please, just cut me up and leave me to rot.
Please.
I know what I am.
And i fucking deserved it. I fucking do.
- Goddamn right!
Then just do it.
She just said she was so..
Take a deep breath.
Adam, I didn't kill your daughter.
You all did.
You all kill her.
And I'm gonna make you pay.
I'm gonna make you pay for everybody.
It's too late to survive?
What the hell are you doing?
Yeah man, what are you doing now?
What are you fuckin doing?
This is justice.
Is that what this is?
Put the knife down brother.
Back away from her.
Put it down.
So you're on her side now?
No.
I love you man.
But I'm not gonna sit here
and let you butch her like that.
There's a difference between them and us.
But if you want to kill her, let's get it over with.
We've got to get the fuck out of here.
God damn you.
I didn't lead you here.
I don't care.
I didn't miss!
I didn't miss!
Don't!
- Adam.
Shoot her.
- Don't.
Don't you fucking dare.
Say the fuckin word.
- Say it.
I have a little sister.
12 years old.
She fell and broke a leg.
Bad.
Twisted bone, sticking out.
Too fragmented to just reset.
She'd slows us down
and died of infection in a week.
Maybe they couldn't heal her.
But she was one of our own.
They strung her up...
Slit up her throat..
They drank bottles of blood as it pour out of her.
They cook and eat her major organ that night.
Three nights later I stab them all to death in the sleep.
Look..
It doesn't change what I once was.
I know that.
If you take me out in that field and
put a bullet in my head I won't resist.
I promise.
But he's right.
They are coming.
You wont last 2 days in the open country
for them tracking you.
You either split up and run,
or make a stand here.
What makes you think we'll last here?
Probably you won't.
But you have a better chance.
You have fortification.
And you know they're on their way.
And..
You have me.
What the fuck are you gonna do?
What the fuck do you think I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna kill them all.
You wanna bandage that up or something?
It won't matter.
Won't this piss him off even more?
At least they won't know who they fuckin with.
We're all gonna die, you know?
And frankly I think this is too easy for you.
Maybe you can prove you're wrong.
We'll miss you old friend.
I wasn't sure before but they certainly be coming now.
It's better that
than have them dig him up like a meal.
Don't you pretend like he meant anything to you.
He was a good leader.
This world has existed for 10 years now.
That's enough shit.
- Why?
Starvation and death is enough in first year
to haunt for a lifetime.
My friend has died before his time protecting us..
Now we're all thats left.
It will be a fucking insult to him if we let them
get the house and those fuckin animal who did this free.
I hope there's a hundreds of those sick fucks.
That's more for us to kill
and less of them left in this world.
But now I'm fighting for you.. and you.
Because you're my family now.
I'm gonna put a hole through those shit
who tries to get in the house tonight.
I don't know why would you trusted her?
She's not lying about wanted
to kill what's coming for us.
Whatever her reasons might be.
Still, we'll need the muscle.
Doesn't means we have to like it.
She could have survive the night
and we would never..
Are you with me?
Yeah.
Great speech buddy.
Sometimes its shows you give it a good thought.
I'm seeing the answer in my mind.
They're memories we've lost here too..
It's getting late.
We need to get ready.
Don't worry.
They're gonna pay for what they've done.
And then we'll eat.
Look to this day.
Yesterday has been a dream.
Tomorrow.. only a vision.
Live for tomorrow.. a vision of hope.
We know they have at least one gun.
Find out what else they might be using.
Go!
You'll look.
You'll listen.
And then you'll learn.
And one day you will lead.
Go now.
Your brother is gonna be very strong one day.
But you're my darling.
You're gonna be so much stronger.
What do we got?
Hard to see.
More than 20.
We're in for one hell of a night.
Save the bullets as the last resort.
- This is our last resort.
Henson!
- Lock and load. Let the countdown begin!
Hey.. take this.
I don't need protection from someone like you but if you..
Are you ready?
- Yes.
Bring me.. their heads.
Now!
There's more coming at us.
Come on! Come on you fucker!
You don't know what the fuck you're
in hell of a treat now.
Make them count.
Everyone.
Come on! Come on get some you son of bitch!
Five bullets now.
Who' next!
Watch out there's one at the window.
That's four ass now.
Watch you head away now.
Guys, go cover in the back.
Henson!
Adam!
Goddamn it!
- Get him some water.
You okay? You alright?
Hurry up.
- Just like I went back for back marathon up the hill.
This fuckin priest chasing me..
- Get some rest.
What's the count at?
I just got 3. They're still in the pistol
and 4 on the riffle.
I still have 3.
- Mary?
Mary!
- Five.
You'll gonna cover with this, alright?
Cover for mine.
You, you and you.
You'll have to find a way inside.
We're not going anywhere.
I need someone to go in there quietly and
find out how many of them realy are.
Now go find a door or go through a goddamn window,
I don't care.
Right now we need to do this.
Go.
They'll come again.. harder..
and full force.
No shit genius.
What the fuck do you looking at?
Huh?
Don't you fuckin look at me.
Don't you ever fuckin look at me again, you hear me?
Shanon, cover the windows.
You fuckin hear me?
- Look who the fuck is talking.
Fuck you!
- C'mon. We have a bigger fight. Shut up!
Why do she have to stay in the house anyway?
I say we send her out there
and we get the fuck out of here.
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?
No.
Nooo!
Shannon.
What did you do?
Roof.
C'mon!
- Fuck off.
I'm sorry..
Hey, how's it going up here?
You got them huh, buddy?
Hey, are you okay?
That's one out of bullets.
- You okay?
It's great. We got them.
Get out of here.
Get the fuck out. Go!
Hey!
See ya, motherfucker!
Shanon!
Henson, help me!
No!
C'mon Shanon, go!
C'mon!
C'mon, go!
Get in the house.
Get in the house. Go!
I ain't coming.
I take care all of you, motherfucker.
Come get some!
It's your shit alone, motherfucker.
C'mon.
Four.
Three.
Where you at, bitch.
Two.
One.
You'll never knocked me down, man.
No.
We make all of you shit, motherfucker.
Here, take it.
Cover the kitchen.
Where's Henson?
What?
- I don't know.
What the fuck?
Are we just gonna stay in here forever?
They eat their own, don't they?
All the shit we kill is enough for them to feed for a month.
Why the hell are they still after us?
They're still human.
What's more human than revenge?
So now this is my fault?
Is it about the boy?
Do it now!
- Fuck.
Stay back.
About time.
I figure they're not gonna start earlier.
It seems we're in trouble.
They weren't going to destroy the house
if they don't have to.
Alright, what the fuck are we gonna do?
- We're not going to stay here burn.
We got seven.
Coming up the front.
How many shot in that rifle?
- Just one.
Use it.
- No. Save it.
Mary, what are you doing?
Stalling them for you to run out from the back.
I need to do this.
Do you think this changes anything?
- No.
I'm just tired of waiting.
Come on Adam,
let's get the fuck out of here.
Wow.. take it easy now.
You sure you got enough bullets
in that thing for all of us?
Those inside are mine.
I brought them here.
I trap them.
They're my kill.
Oh..
Your kill?
So you're not with them?
I know I've never seen you before. I know the look on people
have when they seeing something they never seen before.
You.. you don't have that look.
So you should know that this is a..
'invitation only' party.
This is our land.
Our kill.
And now you..
you belong to us too.
My boy..
for your head.
Now I figure to just let you do it. Shoot me.
Go ahead. Do it.
Either way you're gonna be the prize in my camp tonight.
You fuckers.
Fuck.
- Adam?
I can't leave her.
Just forget her and let's go.
She's dead.
Why would you do that?
The plan, Adam. Making sure she doesn't survive the night
or are you forgotten she's one of them.
She's not one of them.
- Yes, she is!
She's not one of them.
- What are you doing?
Just go.
Just go!
Look at me.
Now all I want is just revenge, bitch.
Come on, come on.
Look at me.
Look at me!
Where are you?
Your wife and daughter..
What were their names?
Nikki.
And Ava.
She was such a happy kid.
Nothing ever gonna make her worries.
It's because she was loved
every second when she was alive.
She had a family.
I couldn't protect them.
What matter is what you did for
as long as you could.
You love them enough to try.
Why did you come back?
Nothing change.. for so long.
And I know she was waiting for me.
Maybe I was looking for a.. sign.
Something that will make her proud to me again.
Maybe that was you.
Maybe I was just tired of being the victim.
I'm sorry to hit you too.
Oh my god.
It's so peaceful.
Yeah.
Is there a chance to find them again?
Always.
