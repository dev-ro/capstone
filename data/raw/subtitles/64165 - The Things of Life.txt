Look at the wheel!
Where are the kids?
Back in the car!
What's happened?
How many of them?
Only one, I think.
Is he dead?
- No, he's fainted.
- He's lucky.
They say he isn't dead.
I thought I had time.
Hell, engine stalls, nothing doing.
'Course, he must've thought
he could pass.
He saw him.
He brakes.
But he's doing over 60.
And his car skids.
I see him coming straight at me.
At the last moment,
not even 10 yards away...
he goes behind me.
"Phew!" I think...
but he goes into the back of me...
He slews round, bounces off my truck
and into the ditch.
He tries hard... Nothing doing...
He rolls over and hits the tree!
THE THlNGS OF LlFE
What are you doing?
Looking at you.
I'll make the coffee after this page.
Damn!
Tell me the word for... telling lies...
or rather, telling stories.
"Verschönern" in German.
- It means "to invent".
- "Embellish".
That's it: embellish.
With two "l"s.
Damn it all!
Did you sign the papers for Tunis?
Are you listening?
Did you sign the papers for Tunis?
No, not yet.
I wish we were already on our way.
Sign them at once.
Or else we'll still be here in July.
The house on Ré lsland?
How old was your son then?
I don't know. Maybe 16.
It was 3 years ago.
Catherine was beautiful.
She still is.
Will you take me there?
Right away.
Just pack. We'll come back Monday.
No, I don't want to go.
I don't want an island that's been used.
Why do you love me?
Because you're old...and ugly!
What's that?
What are you doing?
Changing the quarter. I love that.
The passing of time.
And soon, we'll be gone.
- Am I intruding?
- No, you're always welcome.
I saw my son's car and came up.
- Want some coffee?
- Not too strong.
I don't sleep as well as I used to.
Jeanne says it's my age.
Poor Jeanne! She thinks you're old.
Hello, Dad!
I'll tell Jeanne...
Tell her what?
I saw you. Last Monday.
With Mrs Fantin.
Me...?
In the Luxembourg Gardens.
Kissing her.
Is that a way to speak to one's father?
I haven't seen Mrs Fantin
since her husband's funeral.
Were you kissing her?
Jeanne won't see the joke.
Unlike your mother.
Now she had a sense of humour.
- When Pierre was a kid...
- You weren't there.
That's not true.
Anyway, I was only young.
What was I saying?
Want some coffee?
Wonderful! Quite fine.
Catherine, too, was fine. Anyway...
Sit down.
No, I'm not stopping.
What did I want to say?
I'm in a predicament...
It's so silly.
If you can't help,
never mind. I'll manage.
How much?
100...120,000...
Whatever you can spare...
What about Tunis?
Helen tells me
you'll be away three years.
Three years! That's a long time.
So you'll abandon your old Dad?
How old is he now?
Seventy-two.
Still engaged?
That's right.
I'll take a cigarette off you.
How is Helen?
She's fine.
I LOVE YOU
Let him through, he's crazy.
I quarrelled with Catherine.
- What about?
- About you.
I spoke ill of you.
You shouldn't.
I said you're crazy about your memory.
Nothing's too fine for it.
- You embroider.
- No, you do.
Besides, you weren't there.
I wasn't in your memory?
No. Or I must've forgotten.
Idiot!
- What about the garages?
- What garages?
- For the cars.
- Take a look at the plans.
I'm looking at the building site.
And I don't see any garages.
They're underground.
There's grass on top.
I like to see grass...
but we could get 30 garages on top
without ruining your buildings.
The advertising campaign's started.
The buildings will be sold with garages
putting them in the category above.
That's not possible.
You're kidding, it's settled.
By whom?
The Company, everybody.
But... not by us.
Not by me.
I want people to see gardens
and not garages.
Read your contract over.
There's a clause.
You can stick your contract!
If I see so much as a rabbit hutch
there, I'll blow it up!
Are you going to live here? No!
What if I put a sewer
under your windows?
If your ads come before the plans,
that's your problem!
- Tell all that to Mr Wilkinson.
- I don't know who he is.
He doesn't know him.
Doesn't know who he is!
How was it, at Ré?
Wonderful. Very windy.
- When did you get back?
- Last night.
Your saplings are taller than me now.
The garden looks abandoned,
as I like it.
The shutter still bangs.
They never came to fix it.
You can put the boat in the water.
If you don't, it'll be ruined.
It's a bit heavy for me.
We should sell it,
now you don't come any more.
Bertrand will help you.
He won't come this year.
They finished the fireplace.
- But they broke the table.
- The small oval table?
- Rennes tomorrow...
- Tomorrow?
- The Germans'll be there at noon.
- Yes, right.
They broke that table!
Look, Pierre...
I was wrong to talk about Ré lsland.
The years go by.
You've your life, I've mine.
All's fine.
The Rennes contract and bills
are at the flat.
You'll get them tonight?
I can't tonight. Some time today.
You have the key?
Mrs Berard! Telephone.
No, Paul. I can't talk now.
Tonight. Come and pick me up.
Yes, you know I do.
Me too...
You told Bertrand you're leaving?
Didn't you?
Hello, Guitte!
You startled me!
Please don't move. How are you?
As you can see. You scared me.
How are the grandchildren?
They come in pairs now.
Aline's got twins.
Remember Aline?
Your mother's favourite.
You were like brother and sister.
She has twins.
The one who beat me black and blue?
As if you didn't know!
I keep forgetting you've grown up.
How long since I saw you last?
A long time.
Are you happy?
Yes... And you?
Know how old I am?
Can't remember...
102... maybe 103...
or 105?
I was 76 yesterday.
Watch the boys. You're still pretty.
When your dog died,
I thought of you.
He was the last dog of the family.
Grandad always had 3 or 4.
Catherine doesn't want another dog.
She's right.
We love them... and then they die.
Pierre and François
on a donkey in the rain
The brush.
Paul, the brush!
The brush, Paul!
The brush, Paul!
Thanks, old pal. Good shot!
Didn't know you were here.
I didn't either.
This is Anne, a friend.
My father.
- I've got to go.
- I'll see you out.
I'll be right back.
What's it for?
It's not.
Does it amuse you?
I make and sell them.
This is a bird.
It sells very well.
Some people love the songs of birds.
But birds are dirty
and they tend to fly away.
But they still want to hear their songs.
So I invented this bird.
It's clean, and sings at will.
It can be more chirpy.
And it has one more advantage:
the noise is always the same.
So it becomes familiar...
part of the house.
A little like a pet...
Always with its owner.
Sold many?
About 40.
- Expensive?
- Pretty.
Here's a fantastic gadget.
I need another part to make it work.
It's entirely incoherent.
The English ordered 100.
If I wasn't leaving,
I'd have a year's work.
You're leaving?
You too, I heard.
I'm doing my national service.
Then I'll start something with my pals.
What "something"?
A small business.
Have you seen Guitte?
Yes.
Shall we have a drink?
Yes... of course.
The glasses are on the bookcase.
Like some Pernod?
Very well.
Must be some ice on the table.
Thanks.
Say when.
- Do you need anything?
- No, everything's okay.
It'd be nice if you came...
on holiday with me.
Two weeks.
We'd take the boat out.
But maybe you can't...?
No, I'll be stew all day.
"Stew-ed".
We're going to my folks' tonight.
- Do you mind?
- Not at all. I like your mother.
Shall we ask François to come?
I expect he's invited.
Not the glasses!
I can't see without them.
Just ask me. I'll tell you.
- What do you want to see?
- You.
I'm here. That's me.
I've the papers. Sign them now.
And I'll mail them.
I must think about the dates.
What do you mean?
I'm going on holiday with my son.
Two weeks.
You never told me.
I saw him this morning.
Going to Ré lsland?
Catherine will be glad.
Nothing to do with Catherine.
Only my son.
Would you like dessert?
Two coffees, please.
Don't you believe me?
Yes, I believe you... entirely.
Then when would we leave?
After.
I don't quite get it.
You said you'd both be
presenting your plans in Tunis.
You and the ltalian.
If you're not there,
they'll choose the ltalian.
If my plan's the best,
they can wait 2 weeks.
I'm not their flunkey.
We'll never leave!
- What's up?
- Looking for a chair.
Take mine, I'm going.
I'll be the most sorry
when you leave.
Do you realize? 32 years.
Inseparable!
And you're leaving me for a woman!
Bastard!
- Are you thirsty?
- No.
Let's drink all the same.
Milani's got some Pacherenc.
Do you know Pacherenc wine?
Then imagine a field of buttercups
with a river running through.
April... You're drinking
the month of April.
Milani's got a barrel.
It's a young wine which rarely travels.
You don't love me any more.
I think I don't.
You are beautiful.
- Where's the switch?
- Never mind, I rang.
Here they are!
Good evening, my dear.
Your flowers are wonderful.
You've never been so lovely!
That's because she's happy.
That's not surprising at her age.
Nice party...
Charming, yes.
I knew it'd be detestable.
Why detestable? It's the family.
Don't you like your family?
I hate to waste my time.
In that case, it's annoying.
Yes, it's annoying.
Like a man who can spend
a whole evening without talking to me.
Extremely annoying.
I was busy talking
to your mother, father and friends...
Do you want us to split up?
I did that to you one year ago.
That glumness.
That silence.
Because you'd spent an evening
with a girl.
Usually, men say: "Stop talking".
You said: "Stop keeping quiet".
And I stopped.
Because I thought you'd leave.
When you're in Ré with Catherine,
it'll change.
The evenings will be happier.
I hope so.
And when I'm elsewhere with you?
We'll never be elsewhere.
I'm going to tear up the papers.
Fine!
After your son,
there'll be something else.
Your father. Your work.
Your pal François. Your island.
Anything, anyone.
You don't want to go.
You're afraid to be told,
but I'm telling you.
You love me because I'm here.
But if you had to cross the street,
you'd be lost.
You're like an old man.
Why don't you go back home?
You're expected. Go on.
What am l?
A woman making a scene in a car.
Awful!
Just to keep you from sleeping!
Get out...
I'm looking at you...
and I want to weep. Because I'm tired.
Tired of loving you.
Get out, Helen.
You can't leave the car right here.
I'm going to Rennes.
Now...?
I've an appointment.
You're not taking anything?
I'll buy a shirt on the way.
It'll be an adventure.
I can't give you
what you no longer have:
an island, old friends, a boat...
a school, I don't know...
streets, towns, a garden...
a story.
We have no story.
For you, it's like childless couples...
It's a failure.
I can do nothing about it.
You've nothing to say?
Very well.
You'll call me?
Of course.
Seven hundred.
900 for the lady.
Against you, Madam. 1,100.
Going once...
1,200.
Going... going...
1,800.
Sold!
1,800 at the back. Sold!
- Not before next week.
- Why?
- It's at Ré lsland.
- Just across the water.
Yes, but it's quite a way.
It's lovely, that's why...
I don't mind.
I wouldn't know what to do with it.
You live here?
No, I don't.
I'm from Paris.
Where, in Paris?
Found anything?
- A chest of drawers.
- What style?
Renaissance.
Amusing. Lovely.
Let's go eat some sardines.
- I can't, my sweater's wet.
- So what?
Look at me.
Afraid to catch cold?
No, but...
I like you as you are.
Come on!
I'm tired, Pierre.
Tired of Ioving you.
I'm tired too...
of explaining... speaking...
We must stop...
stop...
I can't write long letters...
Goddamit!
- My radiator's bust.
- Get in!
A stone can be enough...
sometimes.
Unless it's a lack of water.
I'd put water in it.
Our friends will be wondering
where we are.
We'll phone them.
Now? They must've gone fishing.
What can I say?
We'll hire a taxi.
Don't talk nonsense.
So I'm talking nonsense!
We'll find a garage.
But it'll take at least 2 days.
I am Ieaving you.
- We'd better go back home.
- No we won't!
We would have become unhappy.
And I refuse that.
I prefer to go on alone.
- An envelope, please.
- I'll go see.
It's fragile.
- Registered?
- It's slower.
No. Just fill in a form.
- We were cut off.
- Hang up. I'll redial.
- Got any letters for Menage?
- Ask my colleague.
You want a stamp?
30 or 40 francs?
I'd like to call Paris.
- Can you get Paris?
- I'm calling Quiberon.
- What number?
- Babylone 30.77.
No stamp?
Not Quiberon. Paris.
Quiberon's busy.
I'll call Paris now.
Babylone for you.
You're asking for Babylone 30.77?
Mrs Helen Haltig will be back at noon.
Leaving your name?
No, thanks.
Any message?
Tell her she's expected...
tonight at Rennes, Duguesclin Hotel.
Urgently.
I repeat: Expected at Rennes,
Duguesclin Hotel, urgently.
That's right. Thank you.
- 20 minutes. Will you wait?
- Yes!
That'll be 3 francs 80.
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.
What got into me?
I actually wanted to leave you.
I love you.
Marry...
right away...
Right away?
Marriage...
I'm late.
I must shave.
Gentlemen!
Mr. Berard... how are you?
Fine. But I can't continue your project,
because I've to go away.
To Tunis. You know it?
I smoke too much.
He was coming straight at me.
He was going at least 65, wasn't he?
- At least!
- And that's when...
Why did you hesitate?
- My truck's no Jaguar.
- You had time enough.
I stalled.
You never stalled? I stalled.
Whose fault? I couldn't say.
He stalls. I'm on his right.
If I hadn't been there...
Were it not for that ditch,
he'd have made it.
- I thought his steering had gone.
- No, it went afterwards.
People go too fast...
Don't say that.
We don't know what happened.
- I couldn't see what happened.
- Nor me.
I didn't even see him fall out.
It was all over in 5 or 6 seconds.
- Phone the police!
- OK, move your truck.
Take me to that farm over there.
...was Iucky...
...narrow escape...
...not my fault...
The stop sign...
He's crazy...
...my suit...
I've ruined my suit...
I'm tired...
I feel fine, in the grass...
Don't go near! It could explode...
Get an extinguisher!
No need to shout, it's coming.
Careful!
- It's still burning.
- Of course it is.
I'm doing my best.
Step back!
It could blow up!
- Let's go.
- They've my blanket.
I feel too hot.
I should be in pain, but I'm not.
This blanket...
is too warm.
I'm going to open my eyes.
Not right now. I'II gather my strength.
And my car...
must be in a sorry state.
I'II try and open my eyes.
- Is a doctor coming?
- Yes!
I got a fright...
I'II ask Helen to take me back.
First, I'II rest a while.
I'II open my eyes,
then Iet Helen know.
First thing I'II do...
- Ambulance coming?
- Be here any minute.
Did I wake you?
You went to bed late. I'll tell.
Tell who?
Want some coffee?
- Where are you going?
- Got a delivery.
I finished at 3 this morning.
Dad's going to Ré in July.
No kidding.
He came here yesterday.
- What did he say?
- Nothing. We talked.
What about?
I showed him my gadgets.
I asked him about July.
Give me a cigarette.
It doesn't seem to...
- To what?
- I don't know.
I don't know how you stand.
Lunching with me?
If you like.
Get me around noon.
- He's opened his eyes.
- Quiet, please.
Yes, I've opened my eyes. So what...?
I'm alive, I can hear everything.
They're funny!
I'm very tired...
but that's only natural.
I should tell them.
What does he want?
They're not going to bury me, are they?
He might have only fainted.
- Let's turn him over.
- Better wait for the doctor.
The idiots think I'm dead!
Get away, there's nothing to see.
They're mad!
I can hear... and see!
- May I go and phone?
- Yes, but hurry.
A priest...
They're scaring me.
Above all, I mustn't fall asleep.
No, I mustn't...
Who's seen the cyclist?
I saw the car when it started burning.
My husband didn't see him.
Anyway, we're insured.
So are we.
Clear out!
We can't without help.
Suppose you come over!
Don't quarrel.
Clear out! Careful, sir.
- He hasn't been moved?
- No.
There are no others?
How long has he been here?
Half an hour.
You were told to step back!
Is it really serious?
I don't know yet.
Does Pierre know you're seeing Bernard?
I'm not. He gave me a lift.
- You're not accountable to Pierre.
- Yes I am.
I tell him everything.
You didn't tell him much last night.
There were too many people.
Will you marry some day?
Don't know, don't care!
- With a plain tie, this one'd be good.
- Yes, indeed.
I'll take a blue one. He loves blue.
- Have you one with longer sleeves?
- We've every length.
Then I'll take these two...
plus a blue one.
Is his stomach injured?
I don't think so.
- Yours?
- Yes, thanks.
Gently...
He's speaking...
Don't be afraid.
We're taking care of you.
Think he can hear?
I'm afraid not.
- His wife?
- She's gone to the hospital.
Here's his wallet and a letter.
You two go to the police-station.
I'm back. Any calls?
Mrs who...? She left a message?
Is that all?
Who...?
He didn't give his name?
Please, can you repeat his message?
Anne...? Could you lend me your car?
I must go to Rennes. I'll explain later.
I'm so...
Never mind, I'll tell you later.
I'm so happy!
Yes, right away.
No, your mother isn't here.
Someone phoned to say
your father had a car accident.
Yes, this morning.
Nothing serious, but she left at once.
They'll be back this afternoon.
I feel fine...
I must've slept a Iong time.
I heard they're going
to take care of me.
In the grass, I was scared.
Thought I was going to die.
Then they'd have found the Ietter...
and given it to Helen.
I absolutely must destroy it...
Can you speak?
Y-yes...
Where does it hurt?
Your stomach?
Your back?
Can you open your eyes again?
Has he fainted?
I'II tell Helen
not to be afraid of ambulances.
They take me... save my Iife...
talk to me.
I'm at the hospital... not scared...
I think it's sunny...
or is it rain?
No, it's sunny.
I can hear people in the garden.
I can hear the wind.
- What has he had?
- Camphramine.
His blood-pressure was low.
Fine. Thank you.
He can go to theatre now.
What happened here?
A guy had an accident.
- Where is he?
- In hospital.
- Where?
- At Le Mans.
I can see the Iight better.
It's wonderful.
They hurt me before.
In a few days...
I'II be going out.
Just my arm hurts.
I've so many things to do...
The shutter...
in the house...
François...
Got to burn the Ietter.
...so as not to Iive alone.
And... the table...
the oval table...
I... I don't know...
They... they've broken the music...
of the organ...
because...
the musician has fallen asleep...
he...he...has...
he has...fallen asleep...
the musician...
Where is he?
Come with me.
Here are the things which were found...
