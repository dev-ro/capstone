Based on D.H. Lawrence's
"John Thomas and Lady Jane"
Still, those Germans
had admirable machines.
They invented
some extraordinary things.
They still lost the war!
Do you know why they did?
They were too methodical.
They fired their cannon
every 10 minutes, like clockwork.
It's absurd of course.
We soon knew
when we had to run or get down.
Thanks be to God
I didn't fight in that war.
I never could've stood it.
Of course you would have.
You won't be killed
unless you think you will.
I never thought I would be.
And I never met
anyone who was killed
who wasn't already convinced
he would be.
The body works in mysterious ways
with some very strange effects
in wartime.
One day,
one of my sergeants screamed out.
Both his feet had been blown
clean off at the ankle.
I gave him some morphine
to reduce the pain.
When I went back 2 hours later,
he was dead.
It happens.
There's nothing you can do.
No vital organ is hit.
Yet one's life is destroyed.
Nothing anyone can do.
Funny!
Until 1916,
the German cannons outdid ours.
Ours were so old, we never knew
where they'd reach.
One awful day,
our cannons killed our own men
in the front line.
We received the order to charge.
As I ran,
I felt a spray of hot water
on my neck.
It was Wallace.
Such a decent chap.
He was from Argentina.
He called to me as I ran.
I was about to answer him
when I saw him overtake me
with no head.
Like a headless chicken!
He went a long way too.
I was covered in his blood.
When I was picked up
shortly after in Flanders,
I realised I'd never thought
I could be killed.
Not even the day
I saw poor Wallace die.
You're not eating?
We should have invited fewer people.
All that conversation exhausted you.
Clifford, you're tired out.
Should I call the Doctor?
What's the point?
I'll let you rest then.
That day, the valet was ill.
Clifford had an order
for the gamekeeper.
Oh, good evening.
Sir Clifford has a message.
For tomorrow night's meal...
For Sunday...
Sir Clifford would like 2 pheasants.
But you don't have to see to it now.
Tomorrow
will be fine with the cook.
Very well, my lady.
I'll see to it.
That's all.
Thank you. Good evening.
Good evening, my lady.
Does my lady need anything?
No, thank you, Kate. Goodnight.
Goodnight, my lady.
Have you finished, my lady?
Yes, thank you.
Should I help you into bed?
No, thanks, I'll call Marshall.
I'll stay and read for a while.
Goodnight then.
Goodnight, Connie.
Connie!
What's wrong?
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Seen a doctor?
No. I don't think it's serious.
I just feel a bit listless.
Can you get up?
Right...
I see nothing organically wrong.
But you're abnormally weak,
my lady.
I'll prescribe a pick-me-up,
but only you
can make yourself better.
Get a change of air.
Take your mind off things.
If you don't
I won't answer for the consequences.
Consequences?
It runs in the family.
Your mother's cancer was so abrupt.
That kind of illness
always starts with reduced vitality.
What about Mrs Bolton?
The nurse from Tevershall?
Do you know her?
Vaguely.
She'd be just right to look after you.
Maybe you should ask her opinion?
Well, we have.
She's delighted by the idea
and can start on Monday.
What if I don't want her here?
That's entirely up to you.
Then, the matter's settled.
Absolutely.
I'll take Constance
back to London tomorrow.
Be reasonable, Clifford.
You should have had
a nurse long ago.
The following Monday,
Mrs Bolton moved into Wragby.
Sir Clifford prefers to shave himself.
Unless he's too tired.
Marshall will help you
put him in the bath.
Very well, my lady.
I believe your bath is ready.
Thank you.
Right...
I'll leave you to it.
See you later.
Yes, see you later.
I didn't know you were here!
Sir Clifford is in bed.
Good, thank you.
Why don't you go for a walk?
The daffodils are out
by the gamekeeper's house.
You could pick some for your room.
Daffodils? Already?
I wondered
where the noise came from.
I better rest for a minute
before I go on.
Do you want to sit in the hut?
Yes, please.
Thank you.
Should I shut the door?
Oh, no, thank you.
It's very pretty here.
It's so calm.
I'd like to come and rest here
from time to time.
Do you lock the door when you go?
Is there a spare key?
No, mine's the only one.
Couldn't you find me another one?
Another key for the hut?
Don't you understand me?
I understand you quite well, my lady.
Sir Clifford might have a spare key.
Do you think so?
It's possible.
Right.
Very well.
I shall ask him.
And if he hasn't
you can get a copy of yours made.
It shouldn't take
more than a day or two.
Perhaps, I don't even know
who cuts keys.
In that case, I'll see to it.
If my lady tells me the day she goes
I'll give her my key.
I'll let you know.
Good evening, Parkin.
'Evening, your ladyship.
I came to see if you were back.
Sir Clifford wants his tea.
Am I late? I didn't notice the time.
I'm sorry, Clifford.
I didn't realise it was so late.
Where were you all this time?
I went for a walk in the forest.
The flowers are in bloom.
Look. Aren't they marvellous?
I stopped for a while
at Parkin's hut.
You know,
where he breeds pheasants.
Do you know if there's a spare key?
You can pour the water now.
Mrs Bolton's warmed the pot.
A spare key to what?
The hut.
It's so peaceful there.
If I had a key
I could go there from time to time.
Parkin said
that you might have a spare key.
I'll have a look, but I doubt it.
I don't think
Parkyn wants me to have one.
Yes, that wouldn't surprise me.
Why's that?
He must think it's his territory.
It's just a place he goes to work.
To you it is.
He must see it as his den
or his lair.
So, you think I shouldn't go there?
That's not the question.
If you want to go there
you can.
The hut belongs to you,
like everything else.
But Parkin might be offended.
I don't want him to be!
You're asking for too much.
Especially with
such an uncouth fellow!
2 weeks later
June 21st.
June 21st?
Do you want me to shave you?
Do you know how to?
Oh, yes, I've often done it.
Go on then.
I didn't know
my lady played the piano.
We'd all forgotten.
What's going on?
Winter tells me
the miners are on strike.
The board are waiting.
Is it reasonable?
What about your nap?
I feel fine.
- Should I go with you?
- Of course not.
How pretty!
Is it a bird house?
A kind of shelter.
It's pretty.
Have the birds built their nests?
Yes, there's some blue tits.
Where?
In that copse.
I'd so like to be a bird.
I've got that spare key for you.
Really?
I'll fetch it.
Thank you very much.
Are you sure I won't disturb you?
You won't disturb me, my lady.
That's perfect then.
Well, good evening.
Good evening.
From then on, Constance went
to the hut almost every day.
Good afternoon.
- Do you want some?
- Oh, yes!
Thank you.
The next few days, she couldn't go.
Clifford's aunt
had turned up unexpectedly.
Have the eggs hatched?
Almost all of the first clutch.
Oh, they're looking at me.
She won't let me.
Isn't it charming?
It's so charming.
Lively, isn't it?
That's the liveliest one.
Is something wrong?
Oh, no.
It's so trusting.
Don't cry for that, my lady.
Put it back.
Do you want to?
Let's go in the hut.
I suppose it was bound to happen.
Yes, I think so too.
I must hurry.
Don't come with me.
I'll be back soon.
Say something...
What should I say to yer?
You don't regret it, do you?
Me? No.
- Do you?
- Me?
I'm happy.
That night, Constance
was the perfect wife.
The housewife every man dreams of.
Modest yet attentive,
with her big, clear eyes
and calm gentleness
which so well hid her intelligence.
You're here late.
Did you want to come in?
Just to lock up.
Are you angry about yesterday?
Not at all.
And you?
Me? Not at all.
You didn't feel as if you...
so to speak... lowered yourself?
By doing it with a man like me...
Lowered myself?
Why? Do you think
I lowered myself?
With one of your husband's servants.
You're not a servant -
you're the gamekeeper!
But maybe you feel as if you've...
lost something?
Don't think that, my lady.
It's... not easy
to call you "my lady"
and then to...
I don't want you to call me that.
I really don't.
And if you like me...
Do you like me?
Yes.
Ay...
These things happen...
Come on, then.
What's the point of talking?
I can't stay long.
You came so late.
Yer not cold?
Yer should come to my place.
It'd be more comfortable.
Do yer mind if I accompany yer?
Let me go.
I'm not stopping you.
I'll come tomorrow if I can.
Goodnight.
The next few days,
Constance stayed away from the hut.
Hello, Gold.
How good to see you, my lady.
I was worried about you.
How are you?
Oh, I'm fine now. Just fine.
- Would you like a cup of tea?
- I'd love one.
I'm not disturbing you?
You don't miss your job too much?
Oh, no!
Time flies when you have a child.
I always dreamt of having children
and looking after them.
It's heaven.
Luke will be home soon.
First the miners,
then the engineers.
Are you going along the road?
No, I'll go through the warren.
What are you doing here?
Were you going to the hut?
No, I was going home.
I went to Marehay
and I'm on my way home.
I must be going.
No one knows where I am.
I won't bother you any longer.
Come on.
Come on.
We both came together this time.
We did?
How do I look?
My dress isn't too creased?
There.
How can I ever thank you?
What for?
Well, for this.
No reason to thank me.
But...
I just wanted to thank you.
Well, goodbye.
Goodbye.
Sorry, I lost track of time.
I walked over to Marehay.
I saw Mrs Flint and her baby.
Then, I had tea with her.
Such a sweet baby!
His hair is so soft,
it looks like feathers.
Did you wonder where I was?
We did, indeed.
We nearly called the police!
I saw you go towards the gate.
I thought you'd gone
to have tea at the rectory.
I thought of it, but in the end
I went to Marehay.
You should have a hot bath.
You'll catch your death of cold.
Were you looking for me,
Andromache? Could I hope for that?
I am here for my son
Since once a day, you let me see
All that remains of Hector and Troy.
I was on my way
To kiss him and grieve with him.
The Greeks, to judge by their alarms,
Will soon give you more cause to cry.
What is this fear in their hearts?
Has some Trojan escaped you?
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Connie.
Tell me, Connie...
Have you heard the rumour
that you're seeking an heir
for Wragby?
- Is there such a rumour?
- Yes.
As absurd as it may seem.
Who told you?
Winter.
He asked ever so innocently:
"Is there any truth to the rumour?"
And what did you say?
Won't you turn around?
It's annoying!
What could I say?
"There's no truth to it,
to my knowledge".
And that there couldn't be any?
No, I didn't go that far.
I wasn't too sure, to be honest.
What did you tell him?
Well, it may sound a bit puerile,
but I was caught off guard.
I said that we hadn't given up hope.
What if I did have a baby?
Whose baby?
Whose baby!
A baby, that's all. My baby.
Come now!
I may be mundane,
but nature's laws require you
to have a partner
for conception to occur.
Oh, that's not a problem!
You say so yourself: "One body
is as good as the next," isn't it?
Good.
One point to you.
Where's your father
taking you in June?
Near Menton. The Villa Natividad.
The Villa Natividad?
It's too good to be true!
You're going?
