Holy cow!
It's time now for the 1985...
Cochlear implant is especially bright.
We see that the three-amp house device...
Like it.
Let's put a little garlic...
If you want to talk faster...
Bottle or a miniature in the computer.
Lift your buttocks up and squeeze.
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
At first glance, Rory
was as American as a Happy Meal.
We know now that perception would change,
not only for the scientists
who took on his case,
but also for the world at large.
Wow. Look at that.
Who is that handsome dude?
David.
Wow.
- Is that on?
- Yeah.
Check it out.
Such a hottie.
Gross. That's my sister.
Give me the gun.
Monica, right?
What the fuck?
Are you kidding me?!
Direct shot.
How's he gonna get that thing off?
There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
And here we are.
- Hey, sis.
- Are you gonna help, or what?
- Isn't that everything anyway?
- Building the tent!
Yeah, we're building it right...
- Kevin.
- Kiss my ass, Kevin.
Here we have a nice, ice-cold beer.
Take a look at the lake.
"No swimming"?
Yeah.
"Lake"...
E...
Eve?
Evic?
Man, this place is gorgeous.
And there's... that's Robin.
This place looks weird.
Muddy.
Oof.
What?
Whoa.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
You were filming me.
I'm filming everything.
Do you want to try?
Sure.
Yeah.
Here.
Honestly, you know,
I thought it was going to be heavier.
I, found a dead squirrel.
Gross.
I want to see it.
Okay. Yeah?
Yeah.
It's right over...
Hey, sis. You going?
No, I don't want to get swimmer's itch.
That's not a genitals thing, is it?
No. God.
We'll be here.
Hey! What are you talking about?
Let's go!
- Yo, Kev.
- What?
You going to let me drive this beast?
Over my dead body.
Over my dead body.
- What?
- Over his dead body!
How is it, Kel?
Okay. Here we go.
Kelly's up first.
20 bucks says she biffs it.
You're on. You're on.
I'll take your bet.
Kel, you ready?
Hit it!
Come on, come on, come on.
Yes, yes. Yes! Yes, Kelly!
Whoo!
Hey, Jared, throw us a beer!
Come on.
Okay, Nolan Ryan.
Hey, Jared.
Do you want to go next?
- Come on.
- Come on, bud.
Hey, Robin.
You want to try?
All right.
This one's coming in hot.
Yeah, get it!
No!
- My gosh.
- Shit!
My gosh. My gosh.
I'm so sorry.
No, no, no, it's okay.
It's okay. Are you okay?
Yeah.
I think I'm going to go.
You are?
Give me that gun.
All right!
I can't get it!
You got to put your finger in the hole.
I mean, if I can't get the skis on,
there's no way I can water ski.
I don't think I'm going to do this.
Jesus.
Hey, Drew, can you take this?
Yeah.
All right. All right.
You got it? Good. Okay.
Thank you.
Look at those two. So cute.
- Come on.
- It's cute.
I'm going to pull the rope taut.
Then you'll go when you're ready.
Yeah, I'm ready now.
Let's go. Let's do it.
- You got this!
- Ready?
Go!
Got to lean back.
Otherwise you're going to dig in.
I know. I know, Kevin.
Just. Just...
Go!
Almost.
You were up. You were up!
I know. I don't think I can
do it. It hurts my arm.
One more try.
You got to try one more.
Robin, you got to pull back.
I am!
Kevin, fuckin' A!
Hey, guys.
Someone's at the landing.
- Is that DNR?
- I don't think so.
You see Jared and Anna?
That's weird.
All right, Robin, one more time,
and we're going to go back in.
All right?
Come on. Come on!
Go, go!
She did it. She did it!
Whoo! Yeah!
What happened?
Is she okay?
Pull up closer.
Hurry, hurry.
I got her. I got her.
One second.
- Get her out.
- Robin. Robin? Robin?
- Grab her!
- Shit. Shit!
What the fuck is...
Dude, you're bleeding.
Shit, shit, shit!
Get down, get down!
God!
Holy shit.
Bro, are you hit?
Yeah. My hand.
My fucking finger's gone.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Kev? Kelly?
Kelly?
My God.
My God. My God.
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
You got to start the boat.
You got to start the boat.
Got to start the boat.
You gotta start the boat.
- Start the boat.
- No, I can't.
You have to, man, you have to.
I'm fucked. Okay?
Shit.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
You got this.
You got this. Come on.
You got it, Rob. You got it.
Just turn that key.
Turn that key. Okay.
Okay. Come on.
You got it, Rob. You got it,
man. Come on. Come on.
Rob, come on.
- Come on, come on.
- Shit.
There you go, there you go.
Fuck!
No, no, no, no, no, no.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I'm seeing how close we are to shore.
Stay down, stay down.
Down, down.
Here we go. Here we go.
Shit!
Okay.
The shore is closer on my side.
Shooting is coming from your side.
How far is the shore?
It's a swim.
Listen to me.
We can use the boat as cover.
I'll tie the rope to the cleat
and swim the boat to shore.
We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay.
We just have to stay low.
Stay low.
- We drift ashore.
- Stay low. Okay?
Drift to shore. Yeah.
My God!
My God.
He shooting through the boat.
He's shooting through...
Rob?
Rob!
Rob!
It's 10:00 p.m.
Do you know where your children are?
From the beginning...
innocence and...
Fuck.
Drew?
Drew?
Drew?
God.
Hey, can somebody help me up here?
Robin?
Robin, stay down.
Pull me up.
Hold on, hold on.
I'm coming to help.
I'm coming to help!
Just stay down.
I can't.
Robin, stay down.
I'm going to help.
I'm going to...
Jesus. Jesus.
Shit. Kelly.
Kelly, it's okay!
I'm gonna help.
I'm gonna help.
God.
You gonna help out, man?
Dude, your head.
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
Is he dead?
No clue.
The truck's gone.
Hey, Drew, you need help?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- What's wrong?
You know, I just tried to open
up my life jacket and it...
Shit.
Does that hurt?
No. It feels fucking weird.
Here. Here, let me help.
What? What is that?
Shit.
Hey, check this out.
Is that... Is that blood?
Yeah, but whose?
Anna?
- Rob. Rob. Stay back.
- Anna!
Rob. Fall back, man.
Rob. Rob, stay back!
No!
- Rob.
- Don't you
fucking touch me!
God.
But why? Why is she dead
and we're not?
I mean, look at us.
We should be dead.
- But we're not.
- How?
No, no, no.
Honey, don't look at yourself.
It's okay. It's okay.
Just sit here and breathe.
Are we like zombies or something?
No, this is different.
Different how?
I don't know. It's different.
I'm talking. You're talking.
We're all talking.
Rob, you're shot in the head.
Your brain's hanging out
the back of your skull.
If you're a zombie,
you'd be dead. And I...
I've never felt more alive.
You guys feel that?
I feel it, all right.
Hey, has anybody got that
squirt gun? I could use a shot.
This is some Pet Sematery shit.
What the fuck is Pet Sematary?
Stephen King's new...
forget it.
Guys.
They didn't go into the water.
What?
Jared, Anna, Kevin,
they didn't go into the water.
We did. Maybe that has something
to do with this.
Maybe that's why we're still here.
I mean, you saw the sign.
It said "No swimming."
Dude, dude, just shut up.
Rob, I know this sounds
crazy. What I'm saying...
My sister's fucking dead,
and you're talking about magic water.
Hey, my brother's dead, too.
You're not the only victim here, Rob.
We're all victims, Robin.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean. It's just...
What do we do now?
What are we supposed to do?
I mean, what, just pretend
nothing happened?
Go back to the way things were before?
I mean, we can't just do that.
This... This isn't normal.
Rob!
What?
Did you get the license plate
on that truck?
On camera?
Did you get the license plate?
We can find this guy.
Okay.
Find him, then what?
Wait.
You want to kill him?
- I'm not killing anybody.
- Kill?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
We don't kill him. We just...
We do exactly what he did to us.
Give me that camera.
Was discovered by a local boy.
Alone and afraid on top of this butte.
The team at Steamy University
gave him the warmest possible welcome
while still maintaining
a rigorous schedule,
teaching classes by day and
conducting the study at night,
monitoring his response
to their battery of tests.
Rory immediately took to his new home,
but he would not leave
his place on the couch.
One of the many things the team
was hoping to investigate.
Dr. Spratling was now
driving the operation,
making sure to record
every change Rory underwent.
There are many, many questions.
What is he doing?
Why is he here?
How long has he been here?
These are all fundamental questions.
So the first step is communication.
Now what we are doing is showing him
as much of our culture as we can
from a safe distance...
television... to see
if we can initiate a dialogue
we have a hope of understanding.
We don't have any results just yet,
but we believe he is sentient.
And, um, we want to have a conversation.
To maintain secrecy,
university officials agreed the project
would only involve approved personnel,
and even then, only
on a need-to-know basis.
Hold on. Shit...
These sticks are such
a pain in the ass to adjust.
I wish the network
would get us better equipment.
Quit your complaining, sweetheart!
You know why you've looked
amazing for the past 15 years?
Because I'm the one
holding the camera's ass.
So let me do my thing.
It's all me.
Yeah right!
The camera loves me, Luisito.
It's got nothing to do with you.
At least you're not holding this...
disgusting microphone.
What's Andrea doing with it
during the evening shift?
Seriously.
I mean...
At least it's all dried up...
Want some of this?
No, I'll pass.
Gabi?
Gabrielita?
How are we doing on the other side?
Ready for your debut?
Or did you shit your new suit?
Thanks for the good luck wishes, Lucia.
Gentlemen! Please...
Thank you.
Shut the fuck up!
A wise old hag once advised me;
Smile like a queen on camera,
but with the confidence of a bitch.
Something I will always remember, Lucia.
Thank you.
GENTLEMEN, PLEASE SHUT UP!
- Quit the flirting!
- Thank you, Ara. Thank you!
- I'm ready for fuck's sake!
- We're going live.
You are watching...
Ahorita TV.
The news that keeps you up to speed,
with Lucia De Leon.
Good morning!
And welcome back to AHORITA TV.
Our country's best morning new program.
It is 7:15 AM. September 19th.
Live on location,
inside one of the busiest
building complexes in all of Mexico.
Let's take a look
at the exterior of the building,
which is only a few blocks
away from our studio.
Thank you so much, Lucia!
It's a pleasure to introduce myself.
I am...
Mother Fuck!
I am Gabriela Moldonado,
live from Coyoacán.
Though we are booming
with new infrastructures,
we're proud to preserve
so many classical buildings.
A lot of the older buildings
have been standing since the early 1900s.
That's right.
Catch Gabriela on the tour today at noon.
We're very excited because next month
this building will have a series of
that I'd like to announce...
My goodness...
It's shaking.
Lightly, but it's shaking.
Lucia, better come here.
It's safer...
I'll be OK, just wait...
Please stay calm.
It's still shaking.
Everything will be OK.
It's getting worse, Lucia!
Anybody?
Say something, please!
Shit! I can't reach it.
Fucking camera!
I'M RIGHT HERE!
I'M ALIVE!
DON'T MOVE!
Everything is falling.
Be careful.
Make space.
Calm down, sir.
We're getting you out.
- Breathe.
- Boss!
I got a Code 51 over here.
Yes, give me a sec.
Shit.
We're going to flip you around, OK?
Karla.
Eddie, come here.
Help me with this piece of ceiling.
Miguel...
Help with the bar to brace the weight.
- Fuck! I stepped on something.
- You OK?
Yeah, all good.
On three, OK?
One, two, three!
Now pull him forward.
One, two, three!
One more time.
One, two, three!
- I got him, I got him!
- You got him?
Are you bracing his neck, Eddie?
Yes.
Get him sitting on one, two, three!
What is your name? Look at me.
Luis.
Hi, Luis.
I'm Karla, and I'm going to check you out.
Look at me.
How many people are on this floor?
I don't know.
There were five of us.
Lucia...
myself...
We have to get him out of here.
It's collapsing. Eddie?
Find anyone else?
Nobody, sir.
The remaining floors above
are completely leveled,
and we don't have the right equipment.
We need to get outside.
Let's go! On three!
One, two, three!
Let's get out of here!
It's collapsing!
LET'S GO!
- QUICK! IT'S COLLAPSING!
- You were right, Lucia.
The camera loves you.
Drop the fucking camera!
My whole life's been dedicated
to filming behind the camera.
This is my story of real heroes!
What are you doing?! GO!
I'm trying!
Faster! Faster! Don't think,
just run!
There's a door right here!
One, two...
What's happening?!
You doing OK?
This is going to fall on us!
No, it won't. I promise to get
you out of here.
Boss, let's go! Let's go!
I'm coming!
We need to keep moving!
It's gonna collapse!
- Faster!
- Run!
Dude! Take care of the old man!
Let's fucking move!
It's over here.
There's stairs. Watch your step!
Wait, wait, wait!
Shit, watch the walls!
Watch the roof! The roof!
Eddie, we don't have all fucking day!
Stop busting my balls, Miguel!
Luis, move or I'll kill you myself!
- Let go! Run!
- I'm coming!
There's a clear hallway!
Shit, the exit's blocked!
- OK, move!
- We have to keep going!
- Be careful!
- Run, run, run!
Watch out for loose cables!
Come on!
Fucking Argentinian,
nobody understands your Spanish!
Your sister never complained!
There's one over here!
Miguel, I need the bar!
Come on!
- Let's go!
- Run!
There's no fire...
- Everybody OK?
- Yes.
Stay right there.
Break it like a man, Miguel!
Door opens, you follow!
Break it!
Let's go!
Shit, we are getting too low.
We have to keep going.
We can't keep going lower.
What's wrong?
THE DOOR IS JAMMED!
Here comes another tremor.
Luis, move! Move!
Don't let me suffer, Karla!
Luis, don't film this!
Javier, we're getting you out of this!
Grab the bar...
Grab it!
Don't fucking do this!
We are getting you out!
We have no time.
Boss, look at me.
You're not dying like this.
I need you to focus.
How many fucking floors
or exits are in this building?
I don't know!
There's many... and a basement!
You need to get out of here.
Karla. It's not an order,
I'm begging you!
Don't make me do this to you.
Focus!
- Say it.
- No.
- "First me."
- No. No.
Say it! "FIRST ME!"
"First me!"
First me.
Then what?
Then me.
Then after?
At the end?
The end?!
Take it, Karla. End his pain.
We have to go!
Don't think!
Do it, Karla!
What comes at the end?
Say it...
And finally...
NOW, KARLA!
KARLA, DON'T!
ME!
There's an air duct over here!
Hurry, let's go!
Eddie, let's go!
I'm sorry, boss.
Luis!
Can't you see what happened?!
GO!
She killed him. She killed him!
We're right behind you, Karla.
I can't see shit with this headlamp!
Crack the emergency glow sticks.
Yes, the glow sticks!
Take it.
I have a light. Here you go.
Karla, listen to me, please.
We're gonna be OK.
But we have to keep going.
We can't stay.
I promise we'll get out.
But I need you to be strong.
Please...
keep going.
Do it for Javier.
For Javier.
I can't breathe.
Let's go, Luis.
I'm telling you I can't.
I need air!
Karla... Karla, right?
Please hold onto the camera a second.
I need my hands...
Motherfucker! Just drop
that fucking camera already!
I can't with my hands anymore.
Please...
Just a moment. Hold it here.
Thank you.
Luis, take this.
Come on. Go ahead.
Are you fucking with me, Luis?
If you fart again,
I swear to god I'll kill you.
Come on. Let's move it, asshole.
Watch out! There's a drop!
You all right?
Yes.
Hold on. Give me a sec.
Luis, you good?
Yes, I think so.
Take your camera.
What?
Your camera!
I can't hold it anymore.
- Do you hear that?
- I hear something.
It sounds like voices.
I hear somebody.
We gotta go.
- Let's go check.
- We hear you. We're coming!
- Come on, Luis.
- No.
Why not?
Didn't you hear that?
You plan to stay here alone, or what?
Let's go!
Watch your head.
Don't touch anything.
It could collapse any moment.
No shit! You're telling me!
Don't touch anything!
What is this?
What is this place?
Those are pre-Hispanic paintings.
You see this?
Turn on your light!
My battery cut out. One sec...
I think I got it.
It can't be...
Don't touch anything!
Guys...
You see all the skulls?
Eddie!
Get out of the way.
- Eddie.
- Get away from there, Eddie!
That's the wall of Mictlan.
What? The wall of what?
- Eddie.
- What's happening?
- What's going on?
- Eddie?
Stop it, asshole!
You're scaring us.
This is Mictlan.
What the fuck are you saying?!
Our God has risen from the underworld.
Put the bar down.
- Our king...
- Put the bar down!
Will be compensated.
- Our God will feed and collect.
- Eddie, what's happening to you?
Put the bar down!
EDDIE, NO!
What the fuck are you doing?!
The heart is my blood,
my gift, my welcome!
Karla, grab him!
Wall of Tzompantli.
Victims of war.
Display of savage victory.
What the fuck is that?
Step back into our lands of...
TENOCHTITLAN!
Karla! Grab the bar!
GRAB THE FUCKING BAR
FOR FUCK'S SAKE!
Shit! Run!
Wait for me!
Where are you going?!
No! Don't leave me here!
Grab my hand!
Pull me harder!
I can't!
My head.
What's that sound?
My light...
My light!
Where is everybody?
Karla, where are you?
Where are the bodies?
Those big fucking hands.
Our Lord.
All powerful.
God of many names.
Mictlan.
Ixpuztec.
Nextepehua.
Tzontemoc.
Mictlantecuhtli.
Bless us with your presence.
Bathe us with your strength.
Mictlan.
Rise up.
Mictlantecuhtli.
Rise.
Rise.
Rise!
RISE!
We are living in one of the most
terrifying situations of our country.
We haven't seen anything like
this since the quake of '57.
Today, September 19th,
approximately 7:20 AM...
will be a day to remember.
Will be a day to remember.
The team was growing restless
from the lack of progress.
Little did they know that
everything was about to change.
- Just breathe.
- I can't.
Yes, you can.
You're going to be okay.
No, I won't.
But you will.
Don't say that.
Don't say that.
Then, a break.
Sometime between
10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
We missed it?
What he discovered
would change his entire approach
to working with Rory.
I sat down
with Dr. Sarah Grayson,
a protege of Spratling's,
who left the study early.
He was a brilliant man in many ways,
but he never knew when to not...
pick up the snake.
He found something
that could mimic anything
it laid its eyes on.
And that, in and of itself, should have
resulted in a very strict protocol.
Mark, 7:44 a.m.
Rory's first transformation in captivity.
Can you get Gary and a please?
Can you see that?
It's the same posture, but you can see
the locust poking out
from behind the facade.
You see it?
Wow.
Scientific principles
require us to disregard
the emotional need to project humanity
on to things that are not human.
We care about us,
but existence itself doesn't.
And we treat other intelligent
life horribly.
Horribly.
Why shouldn't we expect the same
if it gets the upper hand?
All right. On three.
"Happy one month, Rory."
Ready?
Three, two, one.
Happy one month, Rory!
When we come back,
Spratling and team celebrate
new discoveries while Rory
continues to learn
at an alarming rate.
When friends don't stop friends
from drinking and driving...
friends die.
Okay.
Here we go.
Who here believes in God?
No, I'm really asking.
Who in this room
believes in God?
And what God do you believe in?
Jesus.
Yahweh?
Allah.
Satan.
Yourself.
Your God is dead.
And you're not even surprised.
Of course not.
You saw this coming.
With an increasing eye towards computers
and an obsession with robotics,
we have killed God ourselves,
and in his place created
a new god.
A God of technology.
Well, this is our virtual reality glove.
It's called the Techno Glove.
And the idea is that you slip
this baby on and the glove
allows you to, in our dimension,
let you touch and feel things
in the digital dimension.
So let's say there's a cup, right?
But it only exists on the digital plane.
Well, with this glove,
I can actually pick up
that cup in the digital world.
The Techno Glove allows you
to physically exist
in two dimensions at the same time.
It's pretty cool, right?
I call this little guy here my eye-phones.
This is the visor, and this
is called my eye-phones.
And what this allows you to
do, if I take the helmet
and I put the eye-phones,
my eye-phones down,
I can actually see into
that digital dimension,
that digital space.
So when I go to pick up the cup
with my Techno Glove,
it's really there.
And the idea is that by
wearing this robotic clothing
over our sense organs,
we can transport our sensory system
to a technological reality
that only exists
in the computerized plane.
This right here, this is our prototype 2
model of my eye-phones.
And you see that we integrated
it into a helmet based system.
So when you put the helmet on
and flip my eye-phones down,
once again, you can see
into that digital space.
So I'm able to exist on two
planes of existence right now.
And I can... I can get my coffee cup here,
and I can drink my digital coffee.
It's lukewarm, just the way I like it.
And that's the basic premise
of what I designed here.
This will be the future.
Wearing robotic clothing
and transporting yourself
into the new digital reality.
You did this.
You killed the gods
we worshiped for millennia
and replaced them with
Techno Gloves and eye-phones.
You worship at a new altar.
When we block out our vision
of the real world,
replacing it with a black mirror
of our digital creation...
would we really want to see
what is reflected back on to us?
Using our own microphones and speakers,
can we use the techno God's own language
to communicate with him?
So now that we are here
in this digital realm...
I ask you, if your god
of technology exists,
where does he live?
Does he require
summoning...
summoning, summoning.
That would be apropos.
A new manmade God would be young.
Perhaps he's like a child
waiting to be woken
from his nap by his mother.
So we'll perform an incantation.
A little rise-and-shine for our baby boy,
a child born of hate.
If your god of technology exists,
why doesn't he answer when I call?
We created him.
We gave him a home...
A home, a home...
If your God of technology exists,
why doesn't he answer when we call?
Answer my call.
Wake up.
It's okay. It's a good idea.
If you exist...
wake up!
The God of technology
is a myth for the new era!
A myth! A myth! A myth!
A myth! A myth!
Show yourself.
Wake up!
Show yourself.
Show yourself!
Wake up. Wake up!
Wake up!
Up!
This is not right.
Come off!
No.
Aah!
Hi, Uncle George.
Hey, Ruthie.
There's the lady of the hour.
Hi, Uncle Jeff.
Let me take my glasses off
so I look presentable for the camera.
La la la la la!
That still freaks me out.
Frozen salad.
Congrats.
Auntie Carol, Aunt Susan.
- Congratulations.
- Stop. You look good.
- Hi, girls!
- Congrats, honey.
- Mom.
- Girls.
She must be pregnant.
Hi, cousin Annabel.
This is like 5 or 6.
Grandpa Art and Christopher, of course.
This is my cousin James
being a complete loser, as usual.
Is that beta?
Yep.
Nice.
What deck you got?
Um, the Zenith Video Director.
Ruth?
Come here for a minute, please.
Listen, honey, don't film me.
Can you go out into the garage
and the fridge
and get me some potato salad, please?
Hey. Hey, George.
No smoking inside, please.
Can I try that thing?
Sure.
Hey!
Watch the paint, boys.
- There she is!
- Ruth.
Look at you all dressed up.
You know, you're going to make
some guy real happy
one of these days.
Looks like I already have, Schmidty.
That's fucking gross.
My God! Adam!
I shot you.
You sure did.
Hey, that's a pretty cool squirt gun.
Where did you get that?
The lady in the RV.
- Who?
- I got it from the lady
in the RV.
Yeah, that one.
Welcome.
Hi, Adam.
Bye, girls.
Thank you for coming.
I drove around.
I didn't see a motor home.
Thanks, Jeff.
- Bye.
- Wonderful party.
Thanks for coming.
That's awesome.
Hello, everyone.
And thank you all so much
for coming out to celebrate with us today.
Amanda and Hank, I owe you
for helping out with the food
and Jeanie with the decorations.
I can only do so much,
even though I want to do it all.
We are here because we're family.
And with family
comes history and tradition.
A tradition that dates back to,
well, even before you, Grandpa Art.
A long time.
And today we continue that tradition
with my daughter.
Ruth...
I am so proud of you.
And I am thrilled that even
after all of these years,
we are blessed
with practicing this tradition
out in plain sight.
I...
I only wish that your father
were here to see this.
Come on.
Thanks, Mom.
So, some families celebrate
confirmations, baptisms,
bar mitzvahs, quinceaneras,
but the Wrigleys,
we do something
a little different, don't we?
To the seven.
To the seven!
May we continue this
practice for years to come.
Grandpa Art, you were the surgeon
with a sickle back in the day!
Auntie Susan, your arsenic brownies,
I mean, a classic.
Everyone here has claimed
their seven in unique ways.
And may those seven lives bring
honor, strength, and pride to our family.
Now, now, I know it's a little unorthodox,
but tonight, instead of showing photos
or busting out the slide
projector, I have a video.
They all have the video tapes now.
Sorry. Excuse me.
Get out of my way.
- Move!
- Give it a second.
Well, move.
I want to see.
It's coming.
This is happening every single time.
Wait, what's this, though?
Okay. Okay.
So I saw these people at a gas station,
and I followed them to this lake
in the middle of nowhere.
It was perfect.
There she is.
Is that your dad's
.30-06?
- Yep.
- Wow.
Get out!
No, please. Please don't.
Whoo!
I wouldn't know it was your first.
Okay.
Two down.
Five to go.
This is where it gets good.
Wait. Wait. Okay.
Everyone's out there.
- There she is.
- She's so cute.
Shit.
This is the police!
We have the house surrounded.
The fuck?
- Do not run.
- Holy hell.
They're everywhere.
- They're everywhere.
- It's happening. It's happening.
This is it.
You know what to do.
Excuse me.
- My God. My God.
- More guns in the couch.
You're okay. You're okay.
- This is happening.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
- Mom.
- Honey.
It was only a matter of time.
Everyone, get ready.
- Come on. Come on.
- Coming in hot.
- All right.
- In the kitchen.
Listen, listen, listen.
You fight.
And take your own life.
All right? Do you understand?
Don't let them take you alive.
And do not disgrace the family name.
They're coming around
the side of the house.
You got five rounds
in that one ready to go.
You make me so proud.
Jesus.
Kill as many as you can.
Ruth? Ruth? Ruth!
Who wants a brownie, bitch?!
Ruth, we gotta get out of
here. Let's just go.
No. We're going to stay.
Take as many with us
as we can for the family.
God. I don't
want to die, Ruth.
This wasn't supposed to happen.
Don't be a pussy.
They're coming around
the side of the house.
Don't let them in.
She's got a gun.
She's got a gun!
Here.
I-I can't.
I can't.
Then I'm sorry.
Room clear.
- This way.
- Over here.
Put it down!
My God. Help.
Got two officers down in the kitchen!
She's gone.
Jesus Christ.
What is she? 15?
Be advised we have two armed suspects
in the backyard.
Room is clear.
God!
Alright, we need the rooms clear.
Holy shit!
Over here, come on!
Drop it! Drop it!
No, no, no!
Calm down, ma'am.
Calm down! Stop it!
- Get over here.
- Calm down, ma'am.
Fucking bitch.
Help! Somebody!
You think this is going to work?
No response at all,
while others triggered
an immediate transformation.
What prompted Rory to mimic one form
over another remained a mystery,
and what he would choose
next shocked the entire team.
Are you ready?
Spratling was all too
eager to share the footage.
Just look at him go,
answering us in his own way.
Wow.
Is that Gary?
Special boy.
How do you account for this?
I don't know.
But it's an acknowledgment
of us, which is something.
Want to see it again?
Gary did not want to see it again.
He withdrew further from the team,
reluctant to voice his concern.
Alarmed by the transformation,
Dr. Grayson stepped forward,
calling for an emergency meeting.
I understand your concerns.
But as I look through
the data, it's exactly
the same process as before.
It sees something, it replicates it.
- Right?
- Sure.
So why is this a concern?
Because Gary hasn't been in the chamber.
So if it can mimic Gary,
then it can see through a one-way mirror.
I'm sorry. What does that mean?
It means it's been
watching us the entire time.
That's communication.
Okay?
Rory is reaching beyond
his constraints to make contact.
And it's a miracle
as far as I'm concerned.
Spratling remained intent,
captivated by his subject's
newfound potential,
even as Rory's appearance
grew more and more familiar.
He's reaching out, is he not?
I think so.
Science can be a lonely pursuit.
I think Spratling let something in.
And when he did is when he lost his rigor.
He didn't deserve what happened to him,
but he brought it on himself.
My primary sympathies are
with those he took with him.
I would say their names, but I'm...
It's only going to make me upset.
911 operator.
Somebody is trying to break into my house.
Please help me!
Okay, ma'am. Stay calm.
What's your name?
Karen.
Please send somebody.
What is your address?
885 Oakwood Street.
My God. He's in the house.
Stay on the line, Karen.
I'm sending someone over now, okay?
Okay.
Where are you in the house?
My bedroom.
I can hear him downstairs.
Is your bedroom door open?
Yes.
Close the damn door.
- Karen?
- It's closed.
Okay, I want you to hide if you can.
You have to stay on the line.
He's coming up the stairs.
I think he's on the stairs.
My God.
Karen? Karen? Karen?
I want you to stop talking
and stay as quiet as you can.
He's... he's...
He's outside my bedroom.
Police are on their way.
He's in the room.
Stay quiet, Karen.
My God.
No!
Bobby?
This door look familiar to you?
No, why would it look familiar to me?
The horror video from last week.
The one some sicko sent to the station.
I don't know.
I didn't watch it.
It was the craziest thing.
Some homemade Michael Myers,
Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw nonsense.
Damn, this looks exactly
like the house in that video.
A lot of these places from the late '60s,
they all look similar.
No fucking way.
That is her.
Eyes cut. Throat slit.
That's her.
I saw this murder.
Jesus Christ. That tape is real.
Yeah, but you said
you got the tape last week.
This happened a few hours ago.
What do you think?
They staged the murder
before committing it?
- You check lividity yet?
- Yeah.
Coroner said somewhere
between 1:00 and 3:00 a.m.
Matches the 911 call.
It's fucking impossible.
Hey, there.
Yeah. Yeah.
I need a postal delivery source
for an envelope
I have here on my desk.
Yeah. I need to know where it
was mailed from.
Postmark is last Tuesday.
The corner of Dunning and Royal Road.
No, no, no, no.
It's not private property.
It's a public mailbox.
Yeah. Yeah. On the sidewalk.
No, no, no.
Just hidden surveillance camera.
No sound.
Okay. All righty. Thank you.
Her ears are burned.
Her eyelashes and her fingers are burned.
She can't hold anything.
The medical advances...
The nightmares, the nightmares...
ingredients and dough.
Mention Conan's again, use the words.
"Chicago style deep dish pizza."
Cut to shot of people with cheese
hanging out of their mouths.
Slow dissolve to logo.
You sure this is the same
house as the new videotape?
I'm sure, Bobby.
I've seen everything that happened.
See, the fight started here,
and he used the same electric
knife from the prior scene
to slice off the fingers.
It's fucking impossible.
You got any theories about it?
Well, we got the tape three days ago,
so nothing that doesn't involve the killer
being a time traveler.
This shit is making me religious.
How so?
It's making me think the devil is real.
Hey, it's Wayne.
Yeah, I need to swap out some real eyes
for that hidden camera on the mailbox.
Okay, Gunther.
How you doing?
Good.
What the fuck, son?
Did you send those
two videotapes to the station?
Gunther... you need to answer
your father's question.
I guess so.
You guess so?
You guess so or you know so?
I know so.
And why did you send them here?
You saw what's on them.
Those tapes show two murders
before they happened.
I know.
That's why I sent them.
What does that mean?
Where did you get them?
From home.
I s... I swear,
if you don't tell us
where you got those
two goddamn videotapes,
I will hand you your fucking head!
Bobby.
Gunther, come on.
You're a good kid.
Okay?
So why don't you just tell us
where you got these videotapes from?
Just... tell us what they are.
Last year, we bought a new video recorder.
I wanted a Beta one
because it looks better, but...
Beta does not look better.
He bought a VHS one anyway,
since it was cheaper.
Okay, so your father bought
a video recorder for the house,
and you used it?
Yeah.
Like all the time.
I started by looking up
late-night movies and shows
in TV Guide, 'cause that's when
the best stuff comes on.
So I started recording it...
mostly horror movies,
music videos, stuff like that.
Then, a few months ago,
I started seeing these
other things on the screen.
At first, they were
just different-colored flashes.
But after a few weeks, I could see images
and... I recognized them.
You recognized them from where?
From my dreams.
God damn it, Gunther.
Wait, wait.
Wait.
So y-you're saying
your video recorder
started recording your dreams?
Yes, sir.
Okay.
Okay.
Continue, please.
A-And then what happened?
It came true.
It came true.
W-What is this?
Is this some...
some kind of prank, Gunther?
I mean, I-I hear everything you're saying,
but I-I just...
- I can't believe you.
- Hey, Wayne.
No, I just...
I just can't believe you.
- Wayne.
- I-I... Yes.
Go outside for a second.
He's not lying.
What?
He has these dreams.
Sometimes they're... prophetic.
Prophetic?
Yeah.
I've seen it.
He'll have a dream,
and then later, it'll come true
exactly as he had described it.
It's something that runs in my family.
My sister had it.
It drove her so crazy
that she killed herself.
Gunther's cousin Gwen has it too.
I fucking hate it.
You got to be kidding me here.
I'm not.
So, why didn't you give
the tapes to your dad?
He gets really mad
if I ever even talk about it.
How mad?
Okay, Gunther.
Just... keep going.
Well, at first, it was just, you know,
whatever kind of things on the tapes...
um, the score
of a Friday-night football game,
who would get into a fight
behind Safeway after school
and who would win...
stuff like that.
That's when I had the first nightmare.
The woman who was murdered?
Postal Service retrieved
your package from the mailbox.
Thanks, Jill.
Want to tell me what's on this one?
You should just watch it.
Please! Please stop!
Jesus Christ.
There.
The address on the door.
All right. 4725.
What street?
There.
Reflection on the window.
The Aurora water tower.
The side with the writing on it.
I know exactly where the street is.
Go and get your camera kit.
That is it.
That's the house.
So what, we're just
supposed to go knock on the door
and say, "Hey. Sorry.
You're about to be dismembered soon"?
Hey, Bobby, would you mind,
putting the camera down for a second?
I just want to ask you something
before we go in there.
Yeah. Sure.
Bobby, you know this lady?
Who lives here? No.
No.
Why are you lying to me?
I'm not.
Do you know this lady?
You also know the first victim, too.
These are a copy of the...
the lawsuit filed against you.
Been found in the first victim's house.
I took them from the evidence room.
These two ladies hired
an attorney to come after you.
That second victim is the attorney.
Wait. Listen.
I-I can explain.
You also lied to me about
voluntarily giving up uniform
to become a forensic videographer.
Why didn't you tell me
that you were forced to turn in your badge
after these two ladies
accused you of stalking
and sexual assault?
I mean, did you... did you
really get their addresses
during those traffic stops?
Bobby.
We've been friends for a long time.
I mean, our kids grew up
together, for Christ's sakes.
I'm... I'm... I'm giving you
a chance right now...
right now to tell me the truth, Bobby.
Did you...
Holy shit.
I've got an officer down.
I repeat.
I've got an officer down.
4725 Utica Court.
I need backup and wagons.
Want to tell me what's on this one?
You should just watch it.
All right, Bobby.
Let's go to the AV room.
Gunther, stay right here.
Don't move until we come back, all right?
Bobby.
- Turn off the camera.
- Yeah.
I just dreamed this.
I just dreamed this.
No.
No, no, no, no.
I know what you did, Dad.
You killed them.
You killed all of them.
You just chopped up that woman
from my dream.
And now I'm gonna kill you.
Because this is all your fault,
you worthless little shit!
No.
No.
You're not gonna kill me.
- I'm not gonna kill you?
- No.
I just dreamed everything
that happens next.
I know how this ends.
The dream is playing
on this camera right now.
You little fuckin' freak.
There's a problem.
He is not moving.
Well, you know it mimics things, right?
So how do you know
it's not mimicking something
we haven't seen yet?
Because it doesn't feel right.
Because this is very different.
It's only different behavior.
He's not mimicking. He's sick.
You know he's sick.
That is the only answer.
We exposed him to something,
and now he's not changing
and he's not communicating.
I don't know that he's sick.
How do you know that he's sick?
It's observable, Sarah.
Look at him.
He's sick!
I don't think you can know that.
Doubts were mounting.
Spratling's leadership
was increasingly in question.
And if this is as intelligent
as you say it is,
I think it could be manipulating you.
- We need to intervene.
- I'm not going back in there.
Yes, you are.
Later that evening,
Dr. Grayson packed her things
and left...
Yeah. Well, listen.
I've said everything I can say.
For the last time.
I think you should leave.
I think you should come.
The one thing I can't figure out...
is why no one followed me.
For months now, the details
of exactly what took place
at Stamer University
have been shrouded in mystery.
And while authorities
have recently shared with us
those final minutes of Spratling's tapes.
The disturbing nature of the images
and concern for the well-being
of our viewers
leads us to feel it would be irresponsible
to screen that footage for you at this...
What the fuck...
What the fuck are you doing?
Let's go. God damn it.
Get in there.
- My bad.
- Quit dicking around.
Let's go.
He's about to do it.
- He's about to go.
- Great. I'm filming.
That's it, Gary.
Slow and steady.
We're just helping out our guy.
Ten-four.
I kind of wish it was
someone else right now, but...
You or him?
What... What are you doing?
Get him. Get... Get him.
- Alex...
- Dr. Spratling?
- What is going on here?
- Alex, you should be here.
This is important. I want to
get them in the same shot.
Dr. Spratling,
what is going on here?
Gary's giving him the Adrenalin.
We don't know
how he's going to react to this.
We don't have a choice.
My God!
What's happening?
I can see the locust.
It's okay.
Just administer the Adrenalin.
The feeler is out.
Give him the Adrenalin, Gary.
Give it the... it's got me!
It's got me!
Don't panic. It's okay.
- He's just curious.
- It's around my arm!
Did you do something to provoke him?
- No, no! No, no!
- Are you in pain?
No, but I don't like it.
What should I do?
Okay. Just slowly see
if you can loosen the grip.
Jesus Christ.
It's so tight around my arm.
And it's following me.
It's following me!
- That's okay.
- No! Get me out of here!
- What do we do?
- All right. It's okay, Gary.
We're... We're gonna get you
out of there, okay?
- Should I call somebody?
- No. No. I...
I have an idea.
It's okay, Gary.
Rory.
- He doesn't understand you.
- Yes, he does. You know that.
He listens to tone, not content!
Rory.
My God.
Remember?
Shit.
My God!
God!
That's it.
W-We're going in there.
My God.
Is there anything here
that can neutralize it?
Fucking Christ.
No. No, no, no, no.
What are you doing?
- We need campus security.
- No. They'll hurt him.
- We can do this on our own.
- Tone. Hey.
Keep rolling. Keep rolling.
Come on.
- All right!
- Come on.
Open the door!
Open the... He's screaming!
It's okay.
We're just gonna separate them.
He's okay.
It's o... It's okay.
No. No!
It's okay!
It's okay!
No!
Go look inside!
Go look what's happening!
Okay!
Relax.
- Doctor!
- You're okay. No.
It's okay.
I got you.
Help us, damn it!
It's okay. Relax.
It's okay. Okay.
It's okay.
No, no, no.
Relax. Relax.
It's okay!
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay!
It's okay!
Just...
Fuck it. Let him go.
No!
Wait. Wait.
Come on. I got you.
I got you.
Here. Take this...
Run!
Fuck!
- What do you mean, "fuck"?
- The blood on my hands.
It won't read the print!
This motherfucking thing!
Aah!
- God fucking damn it!
- Can't you override it?
No, I can't override it.
The system won't let me...
Shit.
Come on. Come on!
No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Open the door!
- Come on!
Open the door!
Rory? Rory?
We... We don't have to go
this way.
That's it. Squeeze.
Squeeze.
Squeeze.
Great. Buttocks up.
Squeeze.
Squeeze.
Nice and tight.
Feet flat and squeeze.
Squeeze.
Up. Up. Up.
Good. Good.
Good.
