Can I help you?
Hi.
I think
I'm supposed to work here today.
Sit here until someone comes
and tells you what to do.
You can read this
while you're waiting.
Oh, my feet are killing me.
Who's the new girl?
Must be filling in for someone.
I can't believe you've
been waiting for two hours.
Why didn't you say something?
They um,
they told me to wait here.
Well, I hope you can type.
Follow me.
Okay.
Type the information from
this list onto the invoice form
and then when you're done,
you will make
three copies of each
and the copy room
is down the hall.
Um, try not to make
too many mistakes.
These forms are very expensive.
Hi. Um, you know what?
This machine
isn't working very well.
You better use that one.
Damn, you know, I think
someone put a curse on it,
it just keeps jamming.
All right.
Excuse me...
You know, if you--
if you hit it evenly,
and put pressure down,
it like, doesn't smear that way.
It works better.
And if you, when you're done,
would you close it,
because they dry up really fast.
I like your shoes.
I once read
there are two kinds of time,
mechanical and human.
You could say
my story began at 8:59,
the day I started that job,
and ended months later
when I left it.
But I'd tell you
it began in the past
with my old self and ended
in the future, with a new one.
Hello?
Uh, I'm not sure.
I'm just a temp. Could you
please hold on, please?
Um, he's kind of busy right now.
May I take a message?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Um...
Yeah.
Uh...
I saw you in the bathroom.
You must be the new girl.
Um, I'm just, uh, temporary.
Figures.
That's why they sent me over.
They don't like our kind
mingling with the permanents.
Um, there's a phone call
for Mr. Wheeler.
Eh, just leave 'em on hold.
They'll just get tired
and hang up.
That's lesson number one.
People that sit
in those little glass rooms
don't answer the phone
before 10.
Maybe I should take a message.
Hm.
Oh, don't worry.
If it's important,
they'll call back.
So, see they stuck you
at Louise's desk.
Might as well get comfortable.
She's gonna be out for a while,
if you know what I mean.
Claims she was in
a motorcycle accident.
She's probably faking it.
I'll get it.
Oh, that pen doesn't work.
Oh, just go swipe one
off another desk.
Thanks.
Good morning. Global Credit.
I'm sorry, he's in a meeting.
Hank Starkwell.
Taxpayer.
Says he needs an answer
right away.
It's not 10 o'clock yet.
Hi.
Yeah, I talked to him.
He said go ahead and sell.
No, thank you.
All right,
you have a good day now. Bye.
That's another thing about
temping, give advice.
You know, by the time anyone
finds out, you'll be long gone.
Just be sure
to cover your tracks.
Mm.
Oh, the only real challenge
of this job
is trying to look busy
when there's nothing to do.
They'll keep you here though,
it's how it works.
Part of the corporate hierarchy.
There's got to be a butt
in every seat
or the entire
infrastructure crumbles.
You drink coffee?
Sometimes.
Sooner or later,
someone will ask you
to fetch it for them.
I'll show you the kitchen.
This way, please.
I'm going to be
your tour guide today.
Welcome to
the wonderful world of credit.
Oh, how about this music?
Some Dodo bird
in Charleston did a study.
Said it increases
worker efficiency.
-
- Scary, isn't it?
You know, sooner or later,
you learn to tune it out.
This is where Art sits.
Oh, that's nice.
The smaller the man, the bigger
the desk, I always say.
See that rubber band ball?
It's his prized possession.
Stay away from it.
Who's Art again?
He's the critter
that guards the supplies.
He does nothing really.
He counts paperclips,
checks the mileage
on the copy machine.
Another tax deduction,
same as us.
Speak of the devil.
Why aren't you
at your desk, Art?
I needed pencil holders.
Oh really?
Well, we're working here.
Oh. I'm working, too.
Well act like it.
I am acting like it.
Well let's see you
sit in that chair then, okay?
- Okay.
- The clock is ticking.
We're at work.
He'll look directly
at your feet.
He's got a thing about 'em.
I was in at 8:30.
Oh, God.
See that man?
That's Mr. Kilmer, the chairman.
I'm hoping he gives me
a recommendation
when I leave this place.
Good morning Mr. Kilmer. Hi.
I'm not gonna be a temp
much longer.
- Oh, Miss?
- I've got seniority here.
- I've been here two years.
- We'll talk about it later.
- Hello? Excuse me?
- They hire from within.
Person in the purple dress?
- Hello?
- Hi.
- What's your name?
- Margaret.
Margaret. I'm Milton Lasky.
I know, I did that mass mailing
for you last month.
- You did that?
- It was 3,000 letters, yeah.
Really? You know,
we got a couple of them back.
I think it was
insufficient zip code.
But anyway, listen,
can you get me
the Copeland file immediately?
And then I need some pencils
and I need a cup of coffee,
and you know, what I really need
is I need an assistant
because I mean, you know,
an executive assistant is uh...
An assistant?
Here's the filing room.
Obviously.
Oh, my God, geez.
This place is booby-trapped.
I swear.
This should be it. Look at this.
You know,
got files within files.
If you ever want to
make something disappear,
just misfile it.
Be gone forever.
Like magic.
Oh, hi.
Coffee's fresh. I just made it.
Oh, we're just looking.
Remember to leave a donation.
Okay, mm-hm.
Come here, watch this.
Milt Lasky's cup.
One of these days, the entire
cup is going to disappear
just like that little bikini.
You never know.
Okay, let's deliver this,
I'll show you
the rest of the building
and then we'll get to
the other 50 percent of the job.
What's that?
Lunch.
See the girl in blue?
That's our spot.
Jane, Paula, this is Iris.
Don't panic. She's one of us.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Let me get you a chair.
Oh it's okay. I can just stand.
Oh, I'll just grab one
from the secretarial pool.
Have you been temping
for very long?
No, just one other job
at a bank.
Oh, a bank.
All right. Any cute guys?
I spent most of my time
in the basement.
God, they think they own
the furniture now, too.
Here you go.
You know,
they're just jealous, hm?
Right? You know?
You know,
I-I-I got sent to a bank once
and it was a nightmare.
I set the alarm off and
the cops came.
Ooh, I love the police, eh?
How'd you do it?
There was this button
on the desk
and I kept looking at it
every day for a month,
and finally I just, I pushed it.
Really?
Why?
Well, well how was
I supposed to know?
I mean, you know how it goes.
They never really explain
anything to you
when you're a temp.
They figure you're not gonna
be around long enough
or you're trying to take away
their stupid job or something.
Well fat chance of that, huh?
I've got bigger plans.
I'm a performer.
Oh?
Yeah, yeah. Drama's in my blood.
You know, but there's just,
here's no outlet for it here.
Oh.
God, here he comes.
Eddie Pope,
works in the mailroom.
Another reject of capitalism.
Hi, ladies.
Who's your friend?
Her name's Iris.
She's not interested.
So Jane, you think
we can get together
for those drinks this week?
Oh, gosh.
You know Eddie, um, well,
Derek and I were going to go
and pick out our China patterns
for our wedding.
Oh.
Maybe some other time then.
- Bye.
- I gotta go.
I'm working on a job
for Mr. Kilmer.
- Ooh.
- Mmm.
Oh, God.
He has such a crush on Jane.
He can't even figure it out with
that big diamond ring and all.
Jane honey, shown 'em
that necklace Derek gave you.
Do you like it?
He felt bad for not picking me
up the other day,
so he gave this to me.
I can't wait for you guys
to meet him.
He's going to come to
the happy hour tonight.
- Really?
- All right.
Great. You want to come?
We go every Wednesday.
It's great.
You know, you buy one drink,
you get all the free snacks
you can eat.
You should come. Wanna?
Oh, um...
Oh, you should come.
It's fun.
Be a good time.
I don't know.
Good.
Hey, you guys, let's go
to the Thirty-Fiver this time.
I hear a lot of single men
go there.
Hey, as long as there's food.
No, I have to mail something
for Mr. Anderson first.
Oh, of course you do.
What was--what'd you say?
I said of course she does.
Oh, sure.
Aww.
I've never been
in the Thirty-Fiver.
No, but I hear
it's really great.
Oh, oh, she's doing it again.
- Oh no.
- I--I'm gonna go get her.
Oh, God.
Jane's got this
checking thing going.
She's a perfectionist.
It's a bit much.
Oh, where's the waitress?
I need a drink.
She's flirting,
with the entire restaurant.
On ladies night. Shame on her.
Look at these,
aren't these cute?
I've got to remember to put
these shot glasses
on my bridal list.
Oh, give me your purse.
- What?
- Give me your purse.
Why?
Just give it to me.
There, saved you the trip.
Best wishes, Jane.
Somebody could have
seen that, Margaret.
If anyone saw us,
we'd be drinking by now!
Taking another tip?
I don't like her.
Let's hit the buffet, come on.
Get me some nachos.
I'm gonna make a phone call.
Watch out,
'cause those are spicy.
Ooh, you're right.
Burns.
Ow. Ooh.
- Yeah.
- Oh, excuse me.
Now, I haven't ever
seen you here before.
Oh yeah?
You work around here?
Um, well I'll tell ya,
I'm freelance.
Oh?
What, uh, what line of work?
Um, the credit business.
For now anyway.
Credit?
I did a book report once
for, uh, for extra credit.
Oh.
But that's not what you do,
I'm sure.
No it isn't, no.
Uh, let me give you
one of these.
Okay.
Ooh.
Boy.
Derek's gonna come by
and pick me up later.
He has to work late.
Hm.
Did you see that guy?
Did you see him?
He gave me his card, and a pen.
Jack Shoberg, CLU.
- Cute.
-
What does CLU stand for?
Well, I tell you, I don't know,
but he's probably
an executive of some kind.
How do I know that name?
That sounds so familiar to me,
and I don't know.
Um, I think I need
to get more wings.
Oh, here I'm finished.
You can take mine.
Hm, well, I think
I want to stretch my legs.
Get it?
Oh.
N-no, Jack Shoberg,
I know how I know his name.
The ladies room.
His card was on the floor
in my stall.
Ew, he's passing out his
business cards like it's candy.
That's gross.
Oh, God,
they're laughing at her.
Jerks.
Hey Jack!
Okay, let's get out of here.
Time to go.
Come on, Paula,
we're out of here.
What?
Let's go.
But what about that guy
I just met?
You can do better.
- All right.
- Hi, Camille.
Hi.
Hi.
I think he thinks
you're someone else.
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
Oh, I--I forgot just one thing.
Oh, let's go in.
Eh, nah,
I don't believe that crap.
Oh, you know, some people
can really see into the future.
It's a fact.
- Oh really?
- Yeah.
I read about a horse once
that had ESP.
He could type out messages
on a giant typewriter
with his, um, nose and
he predicted we would
enter World War II,
and he helped find the body
of a boy who'd been missing
for two years.
- Huh.
- He could type?
- Hey, how you doin'?
-
Whoa.
No, I'm just kidding.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Any of you want a reading?
I could give you a discount.
All right.
You said
the magic word. Discount.
Oh.
I see changes ahead.
Something to do with work.
My dad wants me
to get a real job.
Could that be it?
Depends. Is that what you want?
No.
I don't want to do sales.
Do you think maybe I'll just
be able to stay where I am?
Do you want to change
your destiny?
You tiptoe through life.
Don't be afraid
to make your mark.
What'd she say to you?
Some crap-oh-la she read off
some fortune cookie.
The nail that stands out
gets pounded down.
- What a fraud.
-
Hey.
Derek's here.
Do I smell like booze?
Oh, you shouldn't care.
Come on, hurry up.
See you tomorrow.
- Goodnight girls.
- Goodnight.
- Okay.
Hi, Derek.
Wow, do you see him?
Damn he's gorgeous.
What's his deal, though, anyway?
You know anything about him?
Well, I don't know
much about him
except they've been
going out forever
and he buys her a lot of gifts.
What more do you need to know?
I'm tired. I'm going home.
How do you get home?
Oh, I take the Broad Street bus.
- So do I.
- I'll walk you guys.
Come on.
- We should ride together.
- Oh.
Right?
- Yeah!
- All right.
Don't tiptoe through life.
You have to make your mark.
Hi there.
Hello.
Hi. Would you mind
typing this letter from me?
Okay.
Thank you. I appreciate it.
Come in.
That was quick.
Could you make me
40 copies of this please?
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
By the way, what's your name?
Iris.
Iris. Thank you, Iris.
I'm so--I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.
These are excellent.
Did you make 'em from scratch?
Uh-huh.
Where's yours?
Oh, I ate it already.
Mm.
- Mm.
- Yeah?
I fit right in.
I liked it there.
We were becoming good friends.
Ooh, oh, excuse me.
Sorry.
I am so bad.
Okay, watch this.
- Happy?
- Uh-huh.
Okay.
- Sad?
- Mm-hm.
- Angry.
- Uh-huh, right.
Okay.
I give up.
It's fear.
Yeah.
Got my stage name
all figured out, too.
Camille LaPlante.
Oh, you look beautiful.
Thanks.
Oh, Camille LaPlante,
that's perfect.
Uh-huh, yeah.
I'm gonna change it
legally, too,
as soon as I can afford it,
you know?
Oh, I tell you,
ever since I was little,
I just, I knew I was meant
for something big, you know?
That I was just, like,
meant to be somebody.
Just a matter of time
before I get discovered.
Oh look, here's one.
Low wages and all the office
supplies you can steal.
Oh, forget it.
You have to type.
I thought you could type.
No, I cheated on that test.
Oh, I just want a desk by
a window and a decent chair,
but this place is so cheap.
You know, they don't want
to pay benefits.
That's why they hire transients.
Yeah, and they keep on
hiring them, too.
Hm, I should probably
introduce myself.
I'm sure I'll be showing her
the ropes later.
Oh, her loss.
There she goes.
I don't know,
it's good to care, you know?
And to look like you care.
Jane.
Oh, Eddie?
Let me have Kilmer's mail.
- No I--
- Let me deliver this for you.
I have to give it
to his assistant.
His what?
The new girl, Cleo, over there.
Jane, I was at lunch and
I didn't see you down there.
Oh, I'm on a diet.
You don't need a diet.
Excuse me,
I thought she was just a temp,
'cause look at her.
Oh no, no.
She's Kilmer's new assistant.
And she's permanent.
How'd she get that job?
I checked the bulletin board
every day.
It wasn't posted.
Can I have those back?
Yeah, here.
Thank you.
It's the president's mail.
Would you look at that?
A new desk.
Damn this place,
and everyone in it.
You look busy.
I didn't think you would
come back until Friday.
Well.
I thought I'd swing by
and see my girl.
You know, before I take a crack
at those stores in Greensburg.
So, what have you been up to?
Well, my job's going
really well.
My boss really likes me.
There you go.
Haven't I always told you,
just hang in,
be your sweet self, and
good things are bound to happen.
I made some
good friends there, too.
We went out to dinner
and everything.
Well they have good taste.
I hope you're gonna
stay in touch with them.
What do you mean?
I mean after you move on
to the big job
with International Foods.
You know, I have a feeling
this is it.
This is the one.
Yeah, I don't do so well
with interviews.
Don't be silly.
Of course you do.
You've just got to get in there
and promote yourself.
You know what they say, uh,
a good salesman is born,
not made.
You just happened to be born
Bud Chapman's daughter.
You're not a nobody.
Listen, you want me
to call Ed Clayburn
and see if I can't speed up
the whole process?
Oh no, no, that's okay, um...
I actually spoke to him today
and he said he had
to go out of town for a while,
but he got my letter
and he's going to give me a call
when he gets back and
set up an interview.
Great. You're off
to a good start.
You know with your education
and personality,
why, you could take over
a company.
You just have to get
in the door!
Most people
spend their lives
dreaming about the future.
Every day, events
are taking place around us
while we wait for them,
unaware.
Little things.
Quiet things.
You hardly even notice.
That is a French tip.
French tip.
Maybe you only pay attention
when something announces itself
with a shout.
That's how it went
in that office.
We were all just killing time,
waiting for something
to happen, anything.
And then one day,
something did.
Thief, thief!
The money from the coffee can.
It's missing.
-
- Crime in the office,
crime in the workplace.
- Can you believe it?
- This is stupid.
Three lousy dollars,
the whole place falls to pieces.
I hope they don't
take it out of our pay.
- Oh, I hope not.
- Oh, three dollars.
No, come on now,
they wouldn't do that.
I don't think so.
They've done
stupider things, my dear.
Hey, now.
God, they were screaming.
A handful of change.
It seemed small enough.
We didn't know what it meant
at the time.
Didn't change our routine.
Still, maybe there was
something in the air,
like a spell had been cast
over the office.
I wondered if
there was anything
to what that fortune teller
had said.
My time card's gone.
It was here before, wasn't it?
I checked out at lunch,
didn't I?
I don't know, honey.
I don't know,
but I gotta go, okay?
- Copy guy is here.
- You know what, here.
Just take a new one,
a blank one.
Here you go, watch out for me.
People clung to the adventure.
They looked for
ways to draw it out.
Some folks created
their own dramas
and practiced their roles.
And Art...
Hey, Art.
He kept an even tighter
watch over the supplies.
Hey, Margaret.
Can I have some staples?
How many?
How should I know?
Just give me some.
Thank you.
I have
a confession to make, Art.
I've been hocking Wite-Out and
pencils on the corner.
Just to try to make ends meet,
you know?
Is that okay with you?
Well...
You'll keep it a secret?
Okay.
We were supposed to go today.
I--I don't...
Excuse me, this is personal.
Anyways...
Yeah,
it just keeps jamming.
I don't know.
Um, so how do you get
to be a repairman anyway?
I mean, do you go
to a special school, or what?
Um, the machine
is being repaired right now.
You're going to have to
come back.
Iris, you wanna play
hide and seek?
Have you seen
my coffee mug?
Oh, that really nice one
with the naked lady on it?
- Yeah, have you seen it?
- No I haven't.
Are you sure you didn't move it?
I'm sure, yeah.
'Cause it had three pencils
in it and it was on my desk.
I'll tell you what,
I'll look for it.
- It's very important.
- Okay.
Thank you.
Hi.
Move out.
Conference room!
Everybody in the conference room,
chop, chop.
Let's go.
- What's this all about?
- Staff meeting.
We're not on the staff.
It's for everyone.
All the department heads
are going to be there.
Um, I have to ask
you to sit in that chair
because you're sitting
in my seat, thank you.
I always sit in this seat.
It's--it's respect.
It is my seat.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I've called
this meeting today because
a serious problem has been
brought to my attention.
This morning,
Tom Briggs in accounting
noticed his crystal paperweight
was missing.
A number of you
have also reported--
My--my, uh coffee mug
was also missing.
I mean, actually it was stolen.
It wasn't really missing.
It was stolen.
From my office.
Recently.
A number of you
have also reported
- personal items missing.
- Sh.
Mr. Dalton's
gold cigarette lighter,
a framed photograph
and dictionary
from Fred's desk, I believe.
And some spoons
from the kitchen.
Yes, Diane?
I keep a pair of shoes
in my desk
and now one of them is missing.
What?
I didn't take it.
If anyone here has a problem,
financial or otherwise,
come forward and say something.
I like to think of us
as a family here.
It's difficult for me to believe
that someone in this room
could be capable of stealing.
Mm.
Who do you think
is doing it?
Use your heads.
It's that new girl.
- You mean Cleo?
- Yeah, I do.
All that missing junk?
None of it was missing
until she showed up.
Oh, Margaret, how could
you be so sure it's her?
Oh, come on.
She's Kilmer's assistant.
She's got free access
to anyone's office she pleases.
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, but why?
Why would she steal?
Why? Why not?
What difference does it make?
Look, all I know is
that everything was fine
- until she showed up.
- Mm-hm.
- Hm.
- This is not right for me.
You know who
would look great with this?
Iris.
Oh, no,
I don't wear much lipstick.
Why not?
You got such a beautiful mouth.
You got lips that say
hi, I'm here.
I wanna be heard.
Look at that.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Yeah, um, do you have
any free samples of this?
No, we certainly don't.
Uh, that's 50 dollars an ounce.
Okay, great.
I have very expensive taste.
Yes, you do.
Oh, I gotta get my hands
on some of that.
Oh, that's pretty.
You should get that.
Oh no, I don't need anything.
- It'd look really good on you.
- Hm.
Yeah.
Maybe it's part of the sale.
You know, why don't you ask
that lady over there?
Oh no,
I don't wanna bother her.
Excuse me,
is this part of the sale?
Excuse me, miss?
Excuse me.
If it's not on sale,
it should be,
I could tell you that much.
No, it's okay,
I'll pay whatever.
Just go like this
if she looks our way, okay?
We're going for the discount.
That night I thought about
the missing items at work.
How every object
has its own story,
like a seashell, or a notebook.
What seems ordinary to one
person is another's treasure.
- Hi, Iris.
- Well I love
- that ensemble.
-
- Look.
- Wow.
Matching umbrella.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
Ooh, mamacita.
What's the big occasion?
The copy guy.
Today's the day I make my move.
Oh, well you smell nice.
Thank you.
- Hey Barbara.
- Oh, morning Barbara.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Um, I understand that
the four of you
left early yesterday.
I hope you remembered
to adjust your time cards.
- We will.
- Oh yeah, we will.
Also, it has come to
my attention that some of you
are making personal phone calls.
That is against company policy.
Wow. You know what?
I love your scarf.
Ooh, these colors really
compliment your skin tone,
you know that?
Oh Barbara, listen.
The um, the copy machine's
not working again.
Now, do you want me
to call the repair guy?
'Cause I will.
Oh no, no.
That won't be necessary.
I'll have Cleo
take a look at it.
She's very good with
office equipment.
Okay, great. Okay.
Shit, shit.
Shit, I just got
this new outfit and everything.
I just ...can't believe
that skinny bitch
knows how to fix a copy machine.
She was hanging around
my desk the other day
when I was on the phone.
I wonder if she was the one
who ratted on me
for making personal phone calls.
I wonder if she saw us
leave early yesterday, you know?
I'm not afraid of her, I mean,
'cause she's got a job.
She's a nothing.
She's wearing your sweater.
Yeah.
That's weird.
I like your blouse.
Hi--
Yeah.
That new girl,
she kept to herself.
That made her suspicious,
I guess.
But somehow
just by being there,
she seemed to bring us
closer together.
Mm!
Hey, guess who I saw last night?
Jack Shoberg.
- CLU?
- Uh-huh.
Wow, shoot, it's so huge.
I know.
My presentation is gone.
In fact, somebody has
stolen my presentation,
and I don't have a copy of it.
My--my presentation's
in 30 minutes.
- Oh that's terrible.
- So, could we do
something about this please?
My presentation is gone.
In 30 minutes,
the client is coming in.
I can't find it and
I don't have a backup file,
and I think, in fact, somebody
has stolen my presentation.
Okay. We're on it.
Hey, did you guys see Jane?
I need help.
Could you, like be busy
and you know, help?
I'd like help, okay?
My presentation is gone.
They won't remember it,
so when you get to the numbers,
you just follow the numbers.
Don't care about
the colors, okay?
They happen to be
different colors 'cause I did it
- on different days.
- He wants to talk to Bob.
Well, I don't care who he is.
You keep talking to Mort
and you find an answer
because he has
some of the papers.
Ugh, I just bought this blouse.
I was going to wear it
for an audition.
I told you to wear a bib.
Oh God, let me go help her.
Mr. Lasky,
we've got it all taken care of.
You can take this call
into your office.
Honey, I'll call back.
Bye-bye, sweetie.
- Did we do spell check?
- Of course.
- You're sure?
- Mm-hm.
- You wanna check?
- Uh-huh.
Thank God one of us
can type, huh?
Got it.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, check out the new look.
Wire rims.
Why--why is she looking at us
and writing stuff down?
- I don't understand--
- Because she's spying on us.
Noticed that Cleo
didn't get her hands dirty, huh.
Who do you think took
those damn documents, anyway?
She was watching us
the whole time.
I'm getting a little sick of it.
I don't know about you girls,
but we're doing
all the shit work
and they still don't even
notice us.
I don't think it's very funny.
Hey, I'm not laughing.
Yeah, you know what, Jane?
Honey, get me a tissue,
will you?
In fact, give me a whole roll
because I'm low at home.
You know what?
This calls for action.
I think we should go on strike.
Just not show up one day.
Could you imagine?
They'd be--
they'd be totally lost.
They'd be completely scrambled.
Especially between nine and 10.
My God, the phones.
You know, with all of us out,
they'd definitely see
how much they need us.
I think we should do it.
Oh, count me in.
I'm looking forward to it, huh?
Yeah, so am I.
Ooh, me too. Oh, my God.
Wow, it's really coming down.
Even the old ladies are running.
Geez.
You coming or what?
Criminals secretly
wanna get caught.
I read that once,
they have a guilty conscience.
Right, yeah.
She'll trip up.
Nothing lasts forever.
Iris, isn't that
Jane's boyfriend?
That chick better be his cousin.
Oh, man.
Son of a bitch.
Two weeks before her shower.
He's going to have to
buy her something
really big for this one.
Sorry about the mess.
My roommate's out of town.
Just make yourself comfortable.
Take your coat off.
Oh.
-
- So what's your roommate like?
You know what? I don't know.
Well, we never see each other.
- She's a flight attendant.
-
We communicate
through notes on the fridge.
Oh, just like the ones at work.
Yeah.
Yeah, can I fix you a drink?
- Yeah, sure.
- Why don't you go sit down,
and I'll be your hostess.
I got that from a hotel
I was staying at.
A little souvenir, you know?
- Yeah.
- It's cute, right?
Yeah.
Oh.
You know, I like your apartment.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Mm.
You know, this is the closest
I've come to living by myself.
I was--growing up,
I had to share everything
with my sisters.
Perfect sisters, hm.
You know, who would have thought
getting a crummy job
would be so hard?
You know,
the last place I was at,
I was there for three years.
The place was so big,
there were temps
filling in in for temps.
I don't think anyone even knew
I was there, really.
Why'd you leave?
Oh, I didn't leave.
I got canned.
Yeah, I was fired. Ya know.
Guy hired some relative over me.
Permanent.
And I can sit there
and do nothing
as good as anyone's nephew,
you know?
Three years, zip, nothing.
Not even a recommendation.
I think Mr. Lasky is really
starting to depend on you.
I think you, you know,
if you asked,
he'd give you a recommendation.
I hope you're right.
I need that recommendation.
To the recommendation.
Mm.
To the recommendation.
Hmm.
I can't believe you got one
of these, wasn't it expensive?
Oh yeah, please don't
make fun of me today.
My parents are in town.
- Good morning.
- Hi.
How are you today?
You look great.
No, no, no, no, no.
My mom and dad are in town.
Oh, look at you.
Hey,
how was the audition?
Oh, it went okay.
I got a small part.
- Oh.
- I can't wait to see
you act professionally.
It's too bad that last show
fell through.
- Yeah.
- When's this one coming up?
Um, I'm not sure yet,
but when I know,
I'll let you know, okay?
You know what? I gotta get in.
- All right.
- So, all right.
- Hi.
- Lasky needs these
by five. He's been checking on
me every 30 freaking seconds.
I'm gonna lose my--
Look, it's finished,
it's all done.
I really can't deal with this
now, I'm incredibly late,
so if my wife calls,
would you tell her that
I left 15 minutes ago,
but there's just
a lot of traffic?
And Ellen? Ellen,
your hair is so beautiful.
I mean, it looks great
with that little thing in it.
Do you think you could find out
what kind of perfume she wears?
- Mm-hm?
- Would that be possible?
- Yeah.
- And also
if it's her birthday coming up?
No machine can replace me
until it learns how to drink.
Want some?
No, I shouldn't.
Mm.
Gettin' a head start on tonight.
My mom and dad
are taking me out to dinner
to hear
the big loser speech while
- I eat my free chow mein.
-
You're not a loser.
I can just hear my dad now,
yeah.
Why can't you be
more like your sisters?
Is it that hard
to find permanence?
Yeah. Yeah it is.
You could tell him how hard
you've been working here.
I mean, that's something.
Yeah, you're right.
You know what,
that's a good idea.
I think they'll understand.
I'm gonna go smoke.
So will you be taking
this bus to your rehearsals too?
I--I guess so.
You know, when they start,
I mean, right?
I'll tell you, that Jack guy
better call me soon.
I left him two messages.
I suppose he thinks I'm just,
you know,
going to sit around and wait.
Well, I tell you,
I got better things
to do with my time, right?
- Yeah?
-
Don't worry. He'll call.
I'm not worried.
-
- Iris?
Oh, my dad's here.
Hey, you want to come meet him?
He could give you a ride.
Well, I'll tell you,
the bus will be here soon.
I'll wait.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm fine. Go ahead.
- Okay.
- Go ahead.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Wow. Small world, huh?
- Yeah.
-
I had to pick up something
from the mall,
so I thought I'd swing by here
and, you know,
- see if I could catch ya.
- Yeah, thanks.
Look in the backseat.
I had it on layaway.
Dad, it looks expensive.
I don't really need it.
They don't care
what I wear at this job.
Oh, don't be silly.
You're going to need it,
all right,
for that big interview.
It's what's known as
a power suit.
I'm sure you'll hear something
really soon.
Yeah, I guess.
I mean, they've had
your letter for a while now.
Morning, Iris.
- Hi.
- Oh, my God,
it's so bright in here.
I feel like I'm inside
a Xerox machine.
I got so wasted
last night I told my dad
I got a real job here.
Executive assistant.
Please.
Like she needs a briefcase.
You know, in one ear
and out the other, lady.
How much you wanna bet
it's about another
sudden disappearance?
What's going on?
Lasky's dead.
He had a heart attack
last night.
You're lucky
you latched onto MacNamee.
He really appreciates you.
Not to mention he's alive.
Try getting a recommendation
out of a dead guy.
Can I have one of those?
Hm.
You see that old lady
over there?
That's me in a couple of years.
What are you lookin' at?
What are you lookin' at?
Get out of here.
Do you ever feel like you're...
like you're floating?
Like you're...you're not
connected to anything
or anybody?
Yeah. Sometimes.
I feel like I can vanish and
no one would even notice,
not for weeks.
Where's Jane?
Oh, she's still getting ready.
Hope you're all ready
to play some games.
Hey you know,
Jane's sister's an actress too,
just like you.
What?
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
Has she been in anything?
Oh, I don't know.
I think she takes classes.
Oh she does take class? Oh.
You think she's pretty?
Yeah, of course she is.
She's beautiful.
She's Jane's sister.
But what's with these games
she wants us to play?
Stand up and
give advice to the bride?
I mean, ugh.
What do you mean?
Like in front of everyone?
Like a speech?
Oh, yeah.
What are you going to say?
Oh, she won't wanna hear
my advice, believe you me.
I'm going to have to leave soon
before that starts.
And what advice
would that be exactly, huh?
I suppose you have something
against Derek?
What was that?
What was that? What is it?
Tell me.
Margaret, what is it going on?
What is it, that you were
looking at each other?
It's um, I just think she's uh,
she's too good for him.
That's your big secret?
That's it?
Okay. Okay.
Mm. You want to know
the real reason?
Yes.
It's got nothing to do
with Derek, it's Jane.
Have you noticed? She's a freak.
Have you seen her?
Have you looked at her
in the office?
She's like this
fluffy stuffed animal
with these big, dead eyes
just going through the motions,
you know?
That's what she's doing
with this wedding.
She's getting married
just to get married.
Like that's her only option.
Like that's what
she's supposed to do, you know?
All right,
first of all, Margaret,
that is what most people
do do, okay?
Our Jane
has found herself a fella
who gives her things, okay?
And he's got good taste, too.
No, he gives her candy
and flowers and jewelry--
Oh, well that's
a whole hell of a lot.
That's a lot.
You notice it's right after
he's blown her off?
Derek forgot
to pick me up today.
Bing, she gets a necklace.
A cheap necklace at that.
All right, no, you know what?
You have to lighten up because
we're at a party, all right?
Excuse me.
Here, honey.
Just when I was hoping
things would settle down,
Louise showed up.
Hi.
It wasn't her fault,
but she was a permanent,
and so I moved.
Items began to vanish again.
There were new rules
put into effect.
Routine socializing
was frowned upon,
locks appeared
on the kitchen cupboards.
We did our best
to pretend we were busy.
We played our parts.
And we wondered what lay ahead
just around the corner,
waiting for us.
It's so creepy here now,
you know?
I feel like
I'm up to something, right?
Hm.
I'm thinking about asking
the agency for a transfer.
Yeah, even if it's only
for two months, I don't care.
Don't bother, I already tried.
'Cause of my rehearsal schedule,
you know?
Anyway, the agency said that
there's no work right now.
It's just, it's really slow.
I--I gotta keep on working.
I mean, I owe money on a wedding
I haven't even had yet.
If we leave now, we'll never
know how things turn out
with all this stealing.
Don't you want to know
how it ends?
Yeah, and if we leave now,
I bet that sneaky little bitch
would stop her thievery,
and what's that gonna look like?
Like we're guilty.
That's right.
I'm not leaving.
Not without a recommendation.
I was here first.
I'm staying right where I am.
Iris, I just
figured something out.
I think I know what
her next move is gonna be.
I was thinking to myself,
what would I do
if I were the one stealing?
I'd say something of mine
was missing
to deflect attention
like I was a victim.
I mean,
I'm no phony fortune teller,
but I can tell you one thing,
whoever's doing the stealing,
is gonna say something of theirs
has disappeared.
It's gonna be
a sure sign of their guilt.
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.
Attention.
No unauthorized personnel
allowed on this floor
after five.
See, Iris look,
didn't I tell you? Guilty.
Guilty as charged.
My scarf is missing.
You know,
the one you were all admiring.
So if any of you happen
to see it, let me know.
Why was she
looking at us like that?
She thinks it's one of us.
I never said anything
about her stupid scarf.
Hey, it doesn't matter.
To her we're interchangeable.
She always sees us together.
She doesn't know who's who.
But why would she think
it's one of us?
'Cause we're temps.
I mean, you heard what
Kilmer said at that meeting.
That crap about
us all being a family?
Well guess what? We're not part
of their office family
and I don't want to be anyway.
I mean we're like,
temps are like,
we're like corporate orphans.
We're like corporate call girls.
We don't belong and that's what
makes us suspects, okay?
Those are our desks.
Huh.
What a coincidence.
The only temps on this floor.
Shove us together where
they can keep an eye on us.
Could stare at us all day
through these glass walls
for their own sick amusement.
We're in a goddamn fish bowl.
Ooh,
the staple isn't horizontal.
Let's try to keep it neat.
These are going
to important clients.
Paula, do you have a pen?
Mine just ran out.
Cut it out, will ya?
Someone might see us talking.
Credit.
Could you hand me a pen please?
You know what? I'm all out.
Mine keep disappearing.
I can't even find
my Jack Shoberg.
Here, you can take mine.
It's not very sharp,
but you can have it.
No that's all right, Iris.
You need it.
Just take a look at the desk
in front of you, please, Paula.
I am not about to go
picking through
somebody else's desk, uh-uh.
No one is sitting there.
Somebody might see me.
Well you're the one who always
wanted an audience.
You know what?
Just 'cause you're loud doesn't
mean people have to listen.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing. Nothing.
It's just that...
I'm not the one who's always
trying to stir things up
around here, okay?
I haven't done anything wrong.
Oh, really?
copy machine.
Please be quiet.
All right?
You're gonna
get us all in trouble.
I wouldn't point
fingers if I were you, okay?
You're the one who is always
making personal calls.
You're just saying that
because you guys
don't like Derek.
One of you took my chair.
Can I have something
to write with?
But I gave you
a number two pencil yesterday.
Art, please.
I'm in no mood, okay?
Oh, come on, five or six.
I'm on a big project.
Oh, damn this music.
They're trying to
mess with our heads.
I'm going to lunch.
Is anyone coming?
I'm on a diet.
Guess I'll cancel
our reservations for four then
down at the cafeteria, Paula.
I'm going on a lunch date
with Derek.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hey, Louise, it's lunch time.
You wanna smoke some pot?
Are you all right?
No.
I'm pregnant, I think.
Well, have you been to a doctor?
You should really see a doctor.
Yeah.
I have an appointment tomorrow.
I cleared it with Barbara.
So, believe me,
this is the last thing
I can afford right now.
Well if you need any money,
I have some saved.
Um, I got it covered.
Thanks.
Um, you know what?
Just forget
I even said anything.
Probably shouldn't have
even told anybody.
Uh, Paula?
Kilmer's wallet was stolen.
He noticed last night.
There was a lot of money
in it, too.
You see those guards in there?
They're starting
to interview people.
They took a statement from me.
They want us
to rat on each other.
You get it?
It's the old divide and conquer.
They're trying
to split us apart.
Where's Paula?
She get her stupid transfer?
Maybe she has a rehearsal.
Iris.
There's no rehearsal,
don't you get it?
It's all in that
sad, little head of hers.
You'll see when
you try to go to the show,
and she'll mysteriously
disappear, just like last time.
I wonder what else
Camille's been lying about.
Hm.
Oh, shit.
71, 72...
73, 74, 75, 76...
77, 78, 79, 80...
81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87...
Paula.
Hey.
Did you get my message
the other night?
Yeah. Ooh, thank you.
My whole life is here.
Why didn't you call?
I was worried, and then when
you didn't show up yesterday.
Shh, shh, yeah.
Um, I just, I got a lot going on
right now, remember?
- Yeah.
- You know?
- Rehearsals and...
- Yeah.
Everything.
You want some?
Oh no, thanks.
Why are you looking at me funny?
No, I'm not,
I'm not, I'm not looking.
I get it.
My mother knows someone
in cosmetics.
- No, I--
- Okay?
Sometimes she gives me
free samples.
I mean, it's--it's fucking
perfume, anyway, right?
Nice flowers.
What are you so depressed about?
You have a boyfriend,
you're getting married.
At least you have a way
out of this place.
Iris, I'm scared.
I think I was here late
the night Kilmer's wallet
was stolen, I don't know.
I can't remember.
I--maybe I blacked out
or something, but,
I think I'm the guilty one.
I think I did it.
- Don't say that.
- I've been looking.
I've been looking for that
wallet like all over the place,
you know, and
I can't find it anywhere.
God, I don't know,
I don't know anything anymore.
How do you know something?
How do you know
anything for sure?
I don't know.
I don't know.
It's funny
how doubt hides itself.
It follows behind you.
It waits in every corner.
You never see it coming,
but you feel it on the inside.
Maybe it was just that office,
or maybe
it was bigger than that.
It was all around, a million
eyes watching, judging.
The whole wide world, even.
You feel so small.
Could you come with me, please?
We have a certain
standard of grooming
we expect our employees
to adhere to
and your skirt hem is hanging.
I hope this isn't
going to be a problem.
I really--I hate to have
to replace people.
Yes ma'am.
Hey, Iris.
What'd she tell you?
Okay, don't tell me.
Just write it down in that
little notebook of yours.
That's fine.
Do you know anybody here
that might have
a financial need?
No.
How about a grievance?
You hear any complaints
about the working environment
or other personnel?
Anybody that's unhappy?
how well do you know
your coworkers?
Because a situation like this,
your perpetrator
could be anybody.
It could be somebody
you know very little about
or it might be somebody
you think you know very well.
Um, listen.
That problem
I told you about before,
it was a false alarm.
I thought you should know.
Oh no.
Oh, I forgot something.
You can't go up there.
I left my notebook up there.
It's after five o'clock, ma'am.
You'll have to come back
in the morning.
Floor's closed.
That ought to be
worth another meeting.
What the hell?
What?
Did you see a notebook in there?
If you'd like to
report it missing,
we can add to the list.
Excuse me, sir.
Those are someone's
personal belongings.
What are you doing?
Routine desk service, lady.
Oh routine, my butt.
Yeah. Why'd you pick
these desks to search?
You know,
why not that one over there?
Cleo's desk, Cleo with a C,
a big gold C.
Why is she above suspicion, huh?
And you know what they're doin'.
Trying to make us feel guilty
so they can control us.
The just want us to feel
crappy about ourselves.
Yeah.
Yeah,
and doubt everything we do.
That's it, I'm sick of it.
I'm sick of being treated
like a criminal.
I mean that plan we had,
I think it's time
we follow through with it.
Let's not show up tomorrow.
See what happens then.
- Is everyone in?
- Yeah, sure.
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.
Sir, please don't touch those.
Oh, look, my finger puppet.
Incriminating evidence.
Just a bunch of toys.
As a group, we could
really make a big statement.
It's a risk, but you gotta
take a risk to be noticed.
They can't treat us this way
and they can't crush us
down into silence.
Barbara's coming.
Oh, tomorrow, we strike.
Hm, I uh, got scared.
I've never missed a day before.
I changed my mind.
You know what,
I don't know about you guys,
but I need this job, you know?
It's the little I've got.
Besides, do you know
what I was thinking?
Maybe it's not her, you know?
Maybe that's just what
somebody wants us to think.
You know what that cop told me?
He said the guilty one
is always the first one
to point fingers.
Now maybe people
will stop looking
at me all the time, you know?
Where's the other one?
Um, I don't know.
Hm,
that's not very professional.
She knows company policy.
You're supposed to call in
if you're absent or late.
I think she's done this before.
I wish I could tell you
I never doubted a friend.
I wish I could say that place
hadn't gotten the better of us,
but that's not the way
it happened.
Sometimes it hits you
how quickly the present
fades into the past,
and you question everything
around you.
You wonder if anything
you'd ever do would matter,
or if you could just
disappear without a trace.
Hey.
I thought about this crazy place
all day yesterday.
I can't wait to hear
what happened.
They had to have noticed, right?
They noticed.
Did you chicken out
or something?
Paula, what happened?
Look, if I were you, I would
keep my voice down, okay?
'Cause you are in
a shitload of trouble.
What happened?
I guess ...m just not like you.
You know, it's sad, isn't it?
How people always
end up betraying each other?
And for what?
You can read this
while you're waiting.
Excuse me.
You're in my seat.
There's a vacancy
over there, though.
Um, we won't be needing you
here anymore.
Oh.
I was really sick yesterday,
Barbara, but I'm better now.
Okay, okay.
Let's not have a scene.
You aren't needed.
You're firing me?
How can you fire me?
You don't even know my name.
Go on, now, do as the lady says.
Take your stuff and leave.
Oh, I get it.
Oh, you think
I'm your little office thief.
Oh, well you got me.
You finally got me.
- Yeah.
- Come on, you got 15 seconds.
- Let's go.
- Stop it!
- Come on now.
- Would you just let go?
Can't you see
I'm trying to get my stuff?
Can I get my stuff?
Thank you.
I have things, you know?
Is anyone gonna say anything?
You know I'm not a thief.
Is anyone gonna say anything?
Is anyone gonna say anything?
Isn't anyone
gonna stick up for me?
Is anyone gonna speak?
I have a name, you know.
It's Margaret
Margaret with an M.
Take a memo, Barbara.
I often wished I had
that moment to live over.
I wish I had said something.
Soon afterward, Jane left.
The wedding was beautiful.
I read about it
in the newspaper.
Paula got transferred
to the accounting department.
Once in a while,
they let her out to photocopy.
I like to imagine
she kept up her singing.
I had to change desks
a few more times.
It was easier to forget
where I was that way.
And there was something else,
the stealing stopped.
I was almost beginning to think
none of it had happened.
Sometimes I thought about
what Margaret said,
about how a person can
just drift through life,
like they're not connected
to anyone or anything.
You look around.
All those characters
trying to kill time,
going around in circles.
Even if a person wanted
to break free,
they could find out
they've got nowhere else to go.
Listen, I'm going to be
in a meeting shortly,
so when you're done
just pop 'em in the office.
Thanks.
We never talked about it.
We didn't have to.
There was nothing to say.
What she took from us
was more than
she could put in her pocket.
It was like
she owed me something.
Could you make me
10 copies of this, please?
Mm-hm.
Thanks.
That girl Cleo,
she wasn't so different
from the rest of us.
She just wanted to be noticed.
She wanted to be somebody.
You have to make your mark.
Excuse me.
Uh, this is my last day here,
and I was wondering if you could
give me a recommendation?
I'd be glad to.
Oh, well actually
I've already written something,
if you could just sign it?
Well, you've certainly
been a big help here.
Good luck to you, Margaret.
Everything is temporary.
Everything begins and ends,
and sometimes begins again.
When I look ahead,
I imagine
infinite possible futures
repeated like
countless photocopies,
a thousand blank pages.
And in each one I see myself,
never hiding,
never sitting silently,
and never just waiting
and waiting,
and watching the world go by.
