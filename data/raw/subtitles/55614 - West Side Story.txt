Watch this shot now!
Shoot, man! Go!
-Hey, chickie! Chick, chick, chick!
-Boy! Jet boy!
Hey, Jet boy!
Jet, Jet, Jets!
-Come back!
-Chickens!
Beat it!
All right, go, Jets.
Get on it.
Snowboy!
Come on.
Beat it!
Okay, here we go!
Jets! Hey, Jets!
Bernardo! Indio!
Let's chuck them, come on!
Jets, come on! Follow me, baby.
Come on, Jets, come on!
Hey, Jets!
Hello!
Jets, come on! JuIio!
Come on!
Come on, boys.
Come on, now.
Jets!
Break it up, you punks! Cut it out!
Come on, break it up, I said!
Break it up! How many times have I
toId you punks to cut this stuff out?
-Why, if it ain't Lt. Schrank!
-Top of the day, Lt. Schrank.
-And Officer Krupke.
-Top of the day, Officer Krupke.
-I'll give you the top of the head.
-You, get down!
-We're having fun.
-We enjoy the pIayground.
It keeps us deprived chiIdren
off the streets.
-Shut up!
-Born Iike we was on the hot pavement.
-You wanna get your skull broke?
-Baby John, come here. Come here!
All right. Now, which one of these
Puerto Ricans bIoodied you?
-Well, sir--
-Which one?
Excuse me, sir.
As a matter of fact...
...we suspicion that the job
was done by a cop.
-Two cops.
-At the very Ieast.
-ImpossibIe.
-In America, nothing is impossibIe.
All right, wise guys.
Now, you Iisten to me!
All of you! You hoodIums
don't own these streets.
I've had all the roughhouse
I'll put up with around here!
You wanna kill each other,
kill each other! But not on my beat!
-Are there any questions?
-Yes, sir.
WouId you mind transIating
that into Spanish?
Get your friends
out of here, Bernardo.
And stay out.
PIease.
Okay, Sharks.
Boy, oh, boy. As if this neighborhood
wasn't crummy enough.
Now, Iook, fellas. Fellas!
Look, Iet's be reasonabIe, huh?
If I don't get Iaw and order
around here...
...I get busted down
to a traffic corner.
Your friend don't Iike traffic corners.
So that means you're gonna start
making nice with the PRs from now on.
I said nice! Get it?
Because if you don't...
...and I catch any of you doing
any more brawIing in my territory...
...I'll beat every one of you and see
you go to the can and rot there!
-Say goodbye to the nice boys, Krupke.
-Goodbye, boys.
''Goodbye, boys.''
-JaiI? Gee.
-''You hoodIums don't own the streets.''
-''PIay in the park.''
-''Keep off the grass.''
-''Leave the house!''
-''Off the bIock.''
-''Get out of here.''
-''Off the worId!''
A gang that don't own
the street is nothing!
We do own it!
Come on, Jets, round up!
-Not you, Anybodys! Beat it!
-Riff, Iet me in the gang!
Didn't you see me? I was smash!
I'm a killer, I wanna fight.
How eIse will she get
a guy to touch her?
-You dirty rat!
-The road, IittIe girI! The road!
Beat it!
-Beat it!
-Okay, come on.
Now, we fought hard for this turf,
and we ain't just gonna give it up.
The EmeraIds cIaimed it and got shut out.
The Hawks tried taking it and faiIed.
-But these PRs are different.
-They muItiply.
-They're eating all the food.
-Breathing all the air.
-HeIp! I'm drowning in tamaIe.
-You heard what Lt. Schrank said:
We gotta make nice
with them Puerto Ricans or eIse.
Let them move in under our noses
and take it all away from us or eIse.
You're damn right, no!
So, what are we gonna do, buddy boys?
I'll tell you what we'll do.
We're gonna speed fast!
We're gonna move Iike Iightning and
cIean them Sharks up once and for all.
So they ain't never gonna
set foot on our turf again!
And we're gonna do it
in one all-out fight.
-A rumbIe!
-Now cooI, Action boy.
The Sharks want a piece of this
worId too. And they're reaI down boys.
They might ask for bIades, zip guns.
Zip guns? Well, gee.
I ain't finaIizing and saying
they will, Baby John.
I'm just saying that they might,
and we gotta be prepared.
Now, what's your mood, Jets?
-I say go, go!
-I say mix!
-Sock 'em!
-Tear 'em!
-But if they say bIades or guns....
-Let's just forget the whoIe thing.
-What?
-What do you say, Riff?
I say this turf is small,
but it's all we got.
That's for sure.
I wanna hoId it Iike
we aIways heId it, with skin!
But if they say bIades, I say bIades.
If they say guns, I say guns.
I say I want the Jets
to be the number one!
-To saiI! To hoId the sky!
-Then rev us off!
Okay, cats, we rumbIe!
Now, protocaIity calls for a war counciI
between us and the Sharks to set it up.
So I will personally give
the bad news to Bernardo.
-Take a Iieutenant.
-That's me.
-That's Tony.
-Who needs Tony?
We need Tony! He's got a rep
bigger than the whoIe West Side!
-He don't beIong no more.
-Now, cut it, Action!
-Me and Tony started the Jets.
-So where is he?
-How come he has a Iousy job?
-Youth Board corrupted him.
-Temporary sickness! Wait and see.
-Remember when we beat the EmeraIds?
-He saved my neck!
-He'll do it again too!
He aIways came through for us
and he aIways will.
When you're a Jet
You're a Jet all the way
From your first cigarette
To your last dying day
When you're a Jet
Let them do what they can
You've got brothers around
You're a family man
You're never alone
You're never disconnected
You're home with your own
When company's expected
You're well-protected
Then you are set
With a capital J
Which you'll never forget
Till they cart you away
When you're a Jet
You stay a Jet
I know Tony Iike I know me.
I know you can count him in.
-Let's go.
-Where will you find Bernardo?
-It ain't safe in PR territory.
-At the dance.
-But the gym's neutraI territory.
-I'll make nice.
-I'll only challenge him.
-Right, daddy-o.
Listen, everybody dress up
sweet and sharp.
Meet Tony and me at the dance
at 1 0 and waIk tall!
-We aIways waIk tall!
-We're Jets!
The greatest!
When you're a Jet
You're the top cat in town
You're the gold medal kid
With the heavyweight crown
When you're a Jet
You're the swinginest thing
Little boy, you're a man
Little man, you're a king
The Jets are in gear
Our cylinders are clickin'
The Sharks will steer clear
'Cause every Puerto Rican's
A lousy chicken
Here come the Jets
Like a bat out of hell
Someone gets in our way
Someone don't feel so well
Here come the Jets
Little world, step aside
Better go underground
Better run, better hide
We're drawin' the line
So keep your noses hidden
We're hangin' a sign
Says ''Visitors forbidden''
And we ain't kiddin'
Here come the Jets
And we're gonna beat
Every last buggin' gang
On the whole buggin' street
On the whole buggin'
Ever-lovin' street
-Tony, you're not Iistening.
-I read you Ioud and cIear.
-Say something.
-I don't wanna hurt your feeIings.
-You're my buddy, paI, best friend!
-Womb to tomb?
Birth to earth.
That's why you gotta come to the dance
and stand up with me.
Come on, Tony. Just say yes.
Did you ever stop to figure out how many
bubbIes there are in this bottIe of soda?
-Tony, this is important!
-Everything's important, Riff.
You, me, the sweet guy I work for.
The Sharks waIk bad. They bite hard.
-And if we don't stop them now--
-Here! Work for a Iiving.
How do you Iike that? For years
I Iive with a buddy and his family.
I think I'm digging a guy's character.
-Am I a victim of disappointment in you!
-End your suffering, IittIe man.
Why not just pack up your gear
and move out?
'Cause your ma's hot for me.
No! It's because I hate Iiving
with my bugging uncIe!
-Come on!
-UncIe! Come on, uncIe!
-Now, go pIay games with the Jets.
-And why not? They're the greatest.
Ain't they?
Were.
''Were''?
You found something better?
No. Not yet, but....
But what?
You won't dig it, Riff.
So try me.
Come on, Tony. Try me.
Okay.
Every singIe night for the Iast month,
I wake up...
...and I'm reaching out.
-For what?
-I don't know.
A dame?
It's right outside the door,
just around the corner...
...but it's coming.
What is?
I don't know. It's Iike the kick
I used to get from being a Jet.
Now you're taIking!
Man, without a gang, you're an orphan.
With a gang, you waIk
in twos, threes, fours.
When your crew is the best,
when you're a Jet...
...you're out in the sun,
you're home free!
Riff, I've had it!
Tony.
-Look at me, will you? Come on.
-I'm Iooking at you.
Now, I never asked the time of day
from a cIock, did I?
I never asked nothing from nobody,
but I'm asking you.
Come to the dance tonight.
-I promised Doc I'd cIean the store.
-Then do it after the dance.
Tony, I aIready toId
the guys you'd be there.
If you don't show,
I'll be marked Iousy.
-What time did you tell them?
-1 0.
For me, Tony, for Riff!
1 0 it is.
-Womb to tomb?
-Birth to earth. I'll regret this.
Maybe what you're waiting for
will be twitching at the dance.
Yeah, who knows?
Who knows?
Could be
Who knows?
There's somethin' due any day
I will know right away
Soon as it shows
It may come cannonballin'
Down through the sky
Gleam in its eye
Bright as a rose
Who knows?
It's only just out of reach
Down the block, on a beach
Under a tree
I got a feelin' there's a miracle due
Gonna come true, comin' to me
Could it be?
Yes, it could
Something's comin', somethin' good
If I can wait
Something's comin'
I don't know what it is
But it is gonna be great
With a click
With a shock
Phone'll jingle, door'll knock
Open the latch
Something's comin'
Don't know when
But it's soon, catch the moon
One-handed catch
Around the corner
Or whistlin' down the river
Come on, deliver
To me
Will it be?
Yes, it will
Maybe just by holdin' still
It'll be there
Come on, somethin'
Come on in
Don't be shy
Meet a guy
Pull up a chair
The air is hummin'
And somethin' great is comin'
Who knows?
It's only just out of reach
Down the block, on a beach
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight
Maybe tonight
-Por favor, Anita, you are my friend.
-Stop it, Maria.
-You must make the neck Iower.
-And you must stop heckIing me.
We're working on our time now,
not the oId Iady's.
One inch.
How much can one IittIe inch do?
Too much.
Anita, it is now to be a dress
for dancing, no Ionger for praying!
Listen, with those boys, you can
start in dancing and end up praying.
Querida, one IittIe inch.
-Bernardo made me promise!
-Bernardo!
One month have I been in this country.
Do I even touch excitement?
I sew in this pIace all day.
I sit at home all night.
For what did my brother bring me here?
-To marry Chino.
-Chino.
-When I Iook at Chino, nothing happens.
-What do you expect to happen?
I don't know. Something.
What happens when you Iook
at Bernardo?
It's when I don't Iook
that it happens.
I think I'll tell Mama and Papa...
...about you and Nardo
in the baIcony of the movies!
-I will rip this to shreds!
-No!
But if you perhaps couId manage
to Iower the neck....
-Next year.
-I hate that dress!
Then don't wear it and
don't come to the dance with us.
Don't come?
-CouId we not dye it red at Ieast?
-No, we couId not.
White is for babies.
I will be the only one there in a white--
It is a beautifuI dress.
I Iove you!
-Are you ready, Iadies?
-Nardo, come in. Is it not beautifuI?
Yes.
-Very.
-I didn't quite hear.
Very beautifuI.
Come in, Chino. Do not be afraid.
-This is a shop for Iadies.
-We won't bite till we know you better.
Chino, keep both eyes on Maria tonight
in case I cannot. You too, Anita.
-My brother is a silly watchdog.
-My sister is a precious jeweI.
What am I? Cut gIass?
It is most important that I have a
wonderfuI time at the dancing tonight.
It is?
Because tonight is
the reaI beginning of my Iife...
...as a young Iady of America.
Get out of here!
Chino. Chino!
Pepe! Pepe! Come on, guys!
Maria. Maria.
Look what I got.
Maria, these are some of my friends
you've not met.
-Hey, pick up.
-How are you?
This is Loco.
-Teresita.
-My sister Maria.
-Good evening.
-This is Luis and Rosa.
All right, boys and girIs. All right.
Attention, pIease!
Attention!
Come here.
Thank you. My, this is a fine turnout
we have here tonight.
It's all for you, gIad hand.
I know all of you boys and girIs...
...are here because
you wanna make new friends...
...and get cIoser to oId ones.
Yeah!
So tonight, kids,

We're gonna have a get-together dance!
Ginger! Peachy!
All right, all right, now,
kids, kids...
...I want you to form two circIes.
-How many?
-Two.
Boys on the outside
and girIs on the inside.
Where are you?
All right.
Now...
...when the music stops...
...each boy dances with whichever girI
is opposite, okay? Okay!
Two circIes, kids!
Well, it won't hurt you to try.
It hurts. It hurts! It hurts.
Snowboy.
That's it, kids!
Keep the ball rolling.
Round she goes, and where she stops,
nobody knows.
All right, here we go.
Boys to my right and girIs to my Ieft.
-Mambo!
-Mambo!
Go!
Tony!
Mambo!
Mambo!
You're not thinking I'm someone eIse?
I know you are not.
Or that we've met before?
I know we have not.
I feIt....
I knew something never before
was gonna happen, had to happen...
-...but this is so much more.
-My hands are coId.
Yours too.
So warm.
So beautifuI.
BeautifuI.
It's so much to beIieve.
You're not making a joke?
I have not yet Iearned
how to joke that way.
I think now I never will.
-Hands off, American!
-Nardo!
-Stay away from my sister.
-Sister?
-CouIdn't you see he's one of them?
-I saw only him.
Only one thing they want
from a Puerto Rican girI.
-That's a Iie!
-Tony!
-Get away!
-Don't Iisten.
She'll Iisten to me before you.
-If you two want to settIe this--
-Boys! Everything was going so well.
Now, come on!
We're all here to have a good time.
Nardo....
Take her out of here. We're going home.
-Nardo, it is my first dance.
-PIease. We are family. Now go.
Come, Maria.
Maria.
-I don't want you.
-I want you though.
I want you for a war counciI.
Jets and Sharks.
-The pIeasure is mine.
-Let's go outside.
I wouId not Ieave the Iadies
here aIone with your kind around.
We will meet you at midnight.
Doc's candy store?
And no jazz before then.
I understand the ruIes...
...native boy.
Ice.
-Doc's at midnight. Spread the word.
-Right, daddy-o.
Maria.
Maria.
The most beautiful sound I ever heard
All the beautiful sounds of the world
In a single word
Maria
I just met a girl named Maria
And suddenly that name
Will never be the same to me
Maria
I've just kissed a girl named Maria
And suddenly I've found
How wonderful a sound can be
Maria
Say it loud
And there's music playing
Say it soft
And it's almost like praying
Maria
I'll never stop saying
Maria
Say it loud
And there's music playing
Say it soft
And it's almost like praying
Maria
I'll never stop saying
Maria
The most beautiful sound I ever heard
Maria
I do not say these things to spoiI
your evening or to hear myseIf taIk.
-I am here Ionger than you.
-Si, Nardo.
When you're an oId married woman...
...you can tell me what to do.
But now it is the other way around.
-Now go to bed.
-He's the oId married woman.
You know, she has a mother.
AIso a father.
They do not know this country
any better than she does.
You don't know it at all.
GirIs here are free to have fun.
-She is in America now.
-Puerto Rico is in America now.
Sometimes I don't know which
is thicker, your skull or your accent.
-Let them wait.
-Is Maria all right?
-I shouId be so all right.
-It will not happen again.
After tonight, things will be settIed.
-First settIe your stomach.
-Never mind my stomach.
-I mind your nose and head broken.
-Broken?
Sure! They use Maria for an excuse
to start WorId War llI.
-It is more than that.
-More than what? She was only dancing.
With an American,
who's really a PoIack.
Says the spic.
You are not so cute.
-That Tony is.
-And he works.
-A deIivery boy?
-And what are you?
An assistant.
And Chino makes haIf
of what the PoIack makes.
Here comes the commerciaI. ''Your
mother's a PoIe, your father's a Swede.
But you were born here,
that's all that you need.
You are an American.''
But us? Foreigners!
-Lice! Cockroaches!
-But it's true!
When I think of how I thought
it wouId be for us here...
-...we came Iike chiIdren--
-Trusting, with our hearts open!
-With our arms open.
-You came with your mouth open.
-You'll go back in handcuffs.
-I'm going back in a Cadillac.
-Air-conditioned!
-BuiIt-in bar!
-TeIephone!
-And teIevision!
CompatibIe coIor.
If you had all that here, why wouId
you wanna go back to Puerto Rico?
Even if you didn't have that,
why wouId you wanna go back?
-It's so good here?
-It's so good there?
We had nothing!
We still have nothing,
only more expensive.
-Anita Josefina Beatriz--
-No. It's pIain ''Anita'' now.
-Margarita, et cetera.
-You Ieave me aIone. At Ieast I Iet--
Once an immigrant,
aIways an immigrant!
-Look, she's been brainwashed!
-Stop it!
She's given up Puerto Rico and
now she's queer for UncIe Sam.
Oh, no. That's not true.
Puerto Rico
My heart's devotion
Let it sink back in the ocean
Always the hurricanes blowing
Always the population growing
And the money owing
And the sunlight streaming
And the natives steaming
-I like the island Manhattan
-I know you do!
Smoke on your pipe
And put that in
I like to be in America
Okay by me in America
-Everything free in America
-For a small fee in America
-Buying on credit is so nice
-One look at us and they charge twice
I have my own washing machine
What will you have though to keep clean?
-Skyscrapers bloom in America
-Cadillacs zoom in America
-Industry boom in America
-Twelve in a room in America
-Lots of new housing with more space
-Lots of doors slamming in our face
-I'll get a terrace apartment
-Better get rid of your accent
-Life can be bright in America
-If you can fight in America
-Life is all right in America
-If you're all white in America
America
America
America
America
-Here you are free and you have pride
-Long as you stay on your own side
-Free to be anything you choose
-Free to wait tables and shine shoes
Everywhere grime in America
Organized crime in America
-Terrible time in America
-You forget I'm in America
I think I go back to San Juan
I know a boat you can get on
Bye-bye
Everyone there will give big cheer
Everyone there will have moved here
Come on! Hey, Chino!
What are you doing?
-Meet me on the roof Iater.
-''Meet me on the roof Iater.''
-Well, will you or won't you?
-''Well, will you or won't you?''
Well, will you?
You have your big, important
war counciI. The counciI, or me?
First, one...
-...and then the other.
-No. I'm an American girI now.
-I don't wait.
-Back home, women know their pIace.
Back home,
IittIe boys don't have war counciIs.
But they do here. You want me
to be an American, don't you?
Buenas noches,
Anita Josefina Teresita...
...Beatriz deI Carmen Margarita
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera!
Immigrant!
-Good night, Maria.
-Good night.
Maria?
Maria?
Maria?
-Maria!
-Quiet.
-Come down!
-No.
-Maria!
-PIease.
-My mother and father will wake up.
-Just for a minute.
-A minute is not enough.
-For an hour, then.
-I cannot.
-Then forever.
-Then I'm coming up.
-Maria!
-Now see what you've done?
-Momentito, Maria.
It is dangerous. If Bernardo knew--
We won't Iet him know.
I'm not one of them, Maria.
But you are not one of us,
and I am not one of you.
-To me, you're all the beautifuI--
-Maruca!
''Maruca''?
-His pet name for me.
-I Iike him, and he will Iike me.
No. He's Iike Bernardo, afraid.
-Imagine being afraid of you!
-You see?
I see you.
Oh, Maria, see only me.
Only you
You're the only thing I'll see
Forever
In my eyes, in my words
And in everything I do
Nothing else but you
Ever
And there's nothing for me but Maria
Every sight that I see is Maria
Tony, Tony
Always you
Every thought I'll ever know
Everywhere I go, you'll be
All the world is only you and me
Tonight, tonight
It all began tonight
I saw you
And the world went away
Tonight, tonight
There's only you tonight
What you are
What you do
What you say
Today, all day
I had the feeling
A miracle would happen
I know now I was right
For here you are
And what was just a world
Is a star
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
The world is full of light
With suns and moons
All over the place
Tonight, tonight
The world is wild and bright
Going mad
Shooting sparks into space
Today the world was
Just an address
A place for me to live in
No better than all right
But here you are
And what was just a world
Is a star
Tonight
-I cannot stay. Go quickly.
-I'm not afraid.
PIease.
Good night.
I Iove you.
Yes.
Yes. Hurry.
Tony.
-When will I see you?
-Tomorrow.
I work at the bridaI shop
across the street, Madame Lucia's.
-I'll come there.
-At cIosing time, 6:00.
Yeah, yeah.
Good night.
Good night.
Tony.
When you come, use the back door.
Tony.
What does Tony stand for?
Anton.
Good night
Good night
Sleep well
And when you dream
Dream of me
Tonight
Where the deviI are them Sharks?
Maybe they're too chicken to show.
We got time, A-rab.
-Riff and Ice ain't even here yet.
-Come on!
He don't use a switchbIade,
not even an atomic ray gun.
-Who don't?
-Captain MarveI. Gee, I Iove him.
So marry him!
I ain't never gonna get married.
Too noisy.
You ain't never gonna get married.
Too ugly.
-Pow! Pow!
-Cracko jacko!
Down goes a teenage hoodIum.
Gee, couId a reaI zip gun
make you do Iike that?
No, the zip gun couId make you do.
You better wear diapers!
Go waIk the streets Iike your sister.
Listen, jaiIbait, I Iicked you twice,
and I can do it again!
Come on, Anybodys, knock it off.
-Riff's here.
-Cats, all present and accounted for?
I'm really proud of you.
You did good at the dance.
-So where are they?
-Unwind, Action. Any sign of Tony?
InvisibIe, man.
What do you think the Sharks
are gonna ask for?
Mercy.
-Just rubber hoses maybe.
-ReIax.
-You tell him, daddy-o.
-I'm ready.
Easy. CooI.
Cracko jacko!
In a tight spot, you'll need
every man you can get.
-No.
-An American tragedy.
-Pow!
-Oh, poo.
Look, when the Sharks come,
you chicks cut out.
We might.
And then again, we might not.
This ain't kid stuff, Graziella.
I and VeIma ain't ''kid stuff'' neither.
-Are we, VeI?
-No, thank you.
And you can punctuate it.
What are we pooping around
with dumb broads?
-I and VeIma ain't dumb.
-Hey, the bulls.
-Hey, you.
-Hey, you.
-Hey, who?
-Who, who?
Who, me?
Top of the evening, Officer Krupke.
-You.
-Who, me, sir?
Yeah, you. Didn't you hear me?
-Yes, sir. I got 20/20 hearing.
-Then why didn't you answer me?
His mother toId him never
answer back to a cop.
-You want me to run you in?
-Indeed not, sir.
I ought to run all youse punks in.
What are you standing around here for?
You see, sir, we're afraid to go home.
It's such a bad environment.
-We don't get no Iove there.
-It's awfuI.
If we can't stay in the streets all night,
we IiabIe to turn into juveniIe deIinquents.
You cooked up something at the dance.
Don't think you can put nothing over on me.
-Sergeant, come on! We got a 1 0-1 3.
-Go on. Get a move on, all of youse.
Don't Iet me catch you around here
when I get back.
See you around, all right?
-You forgot to say goodbye.
-They ain't got no manners.
''Don't Iet me catch you around here
when I get back.''
-They treat us Iike we ain't human.
-He was pretty mad, huh?
So, what happened?
A big fat nothing, right?
Suppose he comes back
whiIe we're having the war counciI?
We'll snow him some more.
Them cops beIieve everything they read
in the papers about us cruddy JDs.
So that's what we give them:
something to beIieve in.
-You!
-Who, me, Officer Krupke?
Yeah, you! Give me one good reason...
...for not dragging you down
to the station house, you punk!
Dear kindly Sergeant Krupke
Ya gotta understand
It's just our bringin'-upke
That gets us out of hand
Our mothers all are junkies
Our fathers all are drunks
Golly, Moses
Naturally we're punks
Gee, Officer Krupke
We're very upset
We never had the love
That every child ought to get
We ain't no delinquents
We're misunderstood
-Deep down inside us, there is good
-There is good
There is good, there is good
There is untapped good
Like, inside the worst of us
Is good
-That's a touching, good story.
-Let me tell it to the worId!
-Just tell it to the judge.
-Judge? Who's gonna be the judge?
Dear kindly judge, Your Honor
My parents treat me rough
With all their marijuana
They won't give me a puff
They didn't wanna have me
But somehow I was had
Leapin' lizards
That's why I'm so bad
Right! Officer Krupke
You're really a square
This boy don't need a judge
He needs an analyst's care
It's just his neurosis
That ought to be curbed
-He's psychologically disturbed
-I'm disturbed!
We're disturbed, we're disturbed
We're the most disturbed
Like, we're psychologically
Disturbed
Hear ye! Hear ye!
In the opinion of this court...
...this chiId is depraved on account
he ain't had a normaI home.
Hey, I'm depraved
on account of I'm deprived!
-So take him to a head shrinker. You!
-Who, me?
You be the head shrinker.
My daddy beats my mommy
My mommy clobbers me
My grandpa is a commie
My grandma pushes tea
My sister wears a mustache
My brother wears a dress
Goodness gracious!
That's why I'm a mess
Yes, Officer Krupke
He shouldn't be here
This boy don't need a couch
He needs a useful career
Society's played him
A terrible trick
-And sociologically, he's sick
-I am sick!
We are sick, we are sick
We are sick, sick, sick
Like, we're sociologically
Sick
In my opinion, this chiId does not need
to have his head shrunk at all.
JuveniIe deIinquency is
purely a sociaI disease.
-Hey! I got a sociaI disease!
-So take him to a sociaI worker.
-Which way?
-That way.
Dear kindly social worker
They tell me, ''Get a job''
Like, be a soda jerker
Which means, like, be a slob
It's not I'm antisocial
I'm only anti-work
Gloryosky!
That's why I'm a jerk
Officer Krupke
You've done it again
This boy don't need a job
He needs a year in the pen
It ain't just a question
Of misunderstood
-Deep down inside him, he's no good!
-I'm no good!
We're no good, we're no good
We're no earthly good
Like, the best of us
Is no damn good
-The trouble is he's lazy
-The trouble is he drinks
-The trouble is he's crazy
-The trouble is he stinks
-The trouble is he's growing
-The trouble is he's grown
Krupke, we've got troubles
Of our own
Officer Krupke
We're down on our knees
'Cause no one wants a fella
With a social disease
Gee, Officer Krupke
What are we to do?
Gee, Officer Krupke
Krup you!
Curfew, gentIemen.
And Iadies.
-Aren't you up Iate, Baby John?
-I got insombia. Too many worries.
-Any of you see Tony tonight?
-You bet we did.
He was supposed to cIean up the store.
So maybe he decides
to cIean up the PRs instead.
Tony?
-Doc, you ain't gonna cIose up now.
-I'm not?
-We got a war counciI here.
-A who?
To determine weapons.
We gotta set a mix with the PRs.
Weapons. You couIdn't pIay basketball?
-Get with it, buster.
-You don't understand.
We got speciaI business tonight.
-Making troubIe for the PRs?
-They make troubIe for us.
-For you, troubIe is a reIief.
-It's important we stand up to them.
Fighting over a piece of street
is so important?
-To us it is!
-To hoodIums it is.
-Who you calling ''hoodIum''?
-War counciI.
-RumbIes. Why, when I was your age--
-When you was my age?
When my oId man was my age, my brother
was my age. You was never my age!
The sooner you creeps get hip to that,
the sooner you'll dig us!
-I'll dig you an early grave, that's what.
-Dig, dig, dig!
-Doc, set them up. Cokes all around.
-Let's get down to business.
Bernardo hasn't Iearned
the procedures of gracious Iiving.
-I don't Iike you, either, so cut it.
-Okay, kick it, Doc.
-Boys, couIdn't you maybe taIk--?
-Kick it!
We challenge you to a rumbIe.
All out, once and for all. Accept?
-On what terms?
-Whatever terms you're calling.
-You crossed the Iine once too often.
-You started it.
-Who jumped Baby John today?
-Who jumped me when I moved here?
-Who asked you to move?
-Who asked you?
-Go back home.
-Spics.
-Mick!
-Wop!
We accept.
-Time.
-Tomorrow?
After dark.
-PIace.
-The park?
The river.
Under the highway.
Weapons.
-Doc! Hey, Doc!
-Tony!
Weapons.
Weapons!
Weapons.
-You call.
-Your challenge.
Afraid to call?
Rocks.
BeIts.
-Pipes.
-Cans.
-Bricks.
-Bats.
-CIubs.
-Chains.
BottIes, knives, guns!
What a coop full of chickens.
-Who's a chicken?
-Every dog knows his own.
You're all chicken! Tough boys gotta
throw bricks. Afraid to get in cIose?
Afraid to sIug it out, to use pIain skin?
-Not even garbage?
-That ain't a rumbIe.
-Who says?
-You said call weapons.
A rumbIe can be won by a fair fight
if you've got the guts to risk that.
Best man from each gang
to sIug it out.
I wouId enjoy to risk that.
Okay. Fair fight.
Wait a minute!
The commanders say yes or no.
Fair fight.
When I get through with you,
you will be Iike a fish after skinning.
Your best man fights our best man.
And we pick him.
-But I thought I'd be fighting--
-You shook on it.
-Yes. I shook on it.
-Look, if you wanna change your mind--
-Bernardo, baby, you Iike a cigarette?
-No, thank you. I don't smoke.
What you got?
Evening, Iieutenant.
I and Tony was just cIosing up.
Now, this is more Iike it, fellas.
Warms me all over to see you this way.
And after only a few words from me
at the pIayground. How about that?
-Do you mind?
-I have no mind. I'm the village idiot.
Headquarters hears about this,
I may even get a promotion.
Good deaI all around, huh, Bernardo?
I get a promotion...
...and you Puerto Ricans
get what you've been itching for:
Use of the pIayground, use of
the gym, the streets, the candy store.
So what if they do turn this town
into a stinking pigsty?
Don't stop him! He wants
to get home, write to San Juan...
...tell them how he's got it
made over here!
What I mean is, cIear out, you!
I said, cIear out!
Yeah, sure, I know.
It's a free country, and I ain't got
the right. But I got a badge.
What do you got?
Things are tough all over. Beat it!
Okay, fellas...
...where's the rumbIe gonna be?
Come on! ReguIar Americans don't rub
with the goId teeth unIess--
-Lieutenant--
-You shut your mouth!
Come on, Baby John. Before that smooth
IittIe kisser of yours gets cut up for Iife.
Now, where's it gonna be?
The river?
The park?
Fellas, I'm for you. I want this beat
cIeaned up, and you can do it for me.
I'll even Iend a hand if things get rough.
Now, where you gonna rumbIe?
The pIayground?
Sweeney's Iot?
Why don't you get smart,
you stupid hooIigans?
I ought to throw you
in the can right now!
You and the tinhorn immigrant scum
you come from!
How's your oId man's dtt.'s, A-rab?
How's the action on your mother's
side of the street, Action?
One of these days, there won't be
anybody to hoId you.
Get him out of here!
Come on! Beat it! Go!
I'll find out where it's gonna be.
So be sure to finish each other off.
Because if you don't, I will!
Yeah, sure.
Understand them.
That's what they keep telling me
at headquarters. ''Understand.''
You try keeping hoodIums in Iine
and see what it does to you.
It wouIdn't give me a mouth Iike his.
Come on, Doc.
-Don't Iet it get you.
-I'm sick.
-You heard. It'll be a fair fight.
-And that's gonna cure something?
From here on in,
everything's gonna be all right.
-Got a feeIing.
-What have you been taking tonight?
A trip to the moon!
And I'll tell you a secret.
It ain't a man that's up there.
It's a girI.
A Iady.
So that's why you made it a fair fight.
-I'm seeing her tomorrow. I can't wait.
-Tony! Things aren't tough enough?
-Tough? I'm in Iove!
-And you're not frightened?
ShouId I be?
No.
No, I'm frightened enough
for the both of you.
-What has Chino done to her?
-Chino? Why Chino?
Maybe she's just dolling up for us.
RosaIia, ConsueIo, my adorabIe friends,
can you keep a secret?
I'm hot for secrets.
No. I won't tell you.
-What?
-''What?''
-The poor girI is out of her mind.
-I am! Crazy.
She might be at that.
She Iooks somehow different.
-I do?
-And I think she is up to something.
I am?
''I do? I am?''
She taIks Iike a parrot.
What is going on with you, Maria?
I feel pretty
Oh, so pretty
I feel pretty and witty
And gay
And I pity
Any girl who isn't me today
I feel charming
Oh, so charming
It's alarming how charming
I feel
And so pretty
That I hardly can believe I'm real
See the pretty girl
In that mirror there?
Who can that attractive girl be?
Such a pretty face, such a pretty dress
Such a pretty smile, such a pretty me
I feel stunning
And entrancing
Feel like running
And dancing for joy
For I'm loved
By a pretty wonderful boy
Have you met my good friend Maria?
The craziest girl on the block
You'll know her
The minute you see her
She's the one who is
In an advanced state of shock
She thinks she's in love
She thinks she's in Spain
She isn't in love
She's merely insane
It must be the heat
Or some rare disease
Or too much to eat
Or maybe it's fleas
Keep away from her
Send for Chino
This is not
The Maria we know
Modest and pure
Polite and refined
Well-bred and mature
And out of her mind
-Miss America.
-Miss America!
Speech!
Miss America, bravo! Speech!
Speech!
I feel pretty
Oh, so pretty
That the city
Should give me its key
A committee
Should be organized
To honor me
I feel dizzy
I feel sunny
I feel fizzy and funny
And fine
And so pretty
Miss America can just resign
-See the pretty girl in that mirror there?
-What mirror? Where?
-Who can that attractive girl be?
-Which? What? Where? Whom?
Such a pretty face, such a pretty dress
Such a pretty smile, such a pretty me
I feel stunning
And entrancing
Feel like running
And dancing for joy
For I'm loved
By a pretty wonderful boy
You want to sing, do it with the needIe
or you'll be out singing for your supper!
But what can you expect?
We use Singer sewing machines.
Sure. You make the bad joke home
where I can't hear it.
Go now. Go home. It's cIosing time.
-You pull down the shades?
-Yes.
Turn off the Iights and Iock the doors.
-The jaiI is open.
-I thought she'd never Ieave.
I can't beIieve that oId bag of a witch
was once a young bag Iike us.
Let's go before she changes
her mind and comes back.
You go, querida. I will Iock up.
-Why?
-I have work.
Do it tomorrow.
-I am in no hurry.
-I am.
I'm going home now
and take a nice, Iong bubbIe bath.
-BIack Orchid.
-BIack Orchid?
All over.
I got a date with Nardo
after the rumbIe.
What rumbIe?
Oh, well, Nardo's Sharks
and those boys at the dance.
-They fight each other tonight?
-They don't pIay patsy.
Why must they aIways fight?
You saw how they dance, Iike
they gotta get rid of something quick.
-That's how they fight.
-To get rid of what?
Too much feeIing.
And they do get rid of it.
Boy, after a fight,
that brother of yours is so heaIthy.
Definitely. BIack Orchid.
''You go, querida. I will Iock up.''
It's too early for noches.
Buenas tardes.
He just came from
the drugstore to deIiver aspirin.
You'll need it.
Not us. We're fine.
-We're out of the worId.
-You're out of your heads.
-We're 1 2 feet in the air.
-Anita can see that.
You will not tell?
Tell what? How can I know what
goes on 1 2 feet over my head?
You better be home in 1 5 minutes.
It's all right. She Iikes us.
-But she is worried, and so am I.
-That's fooIish.
-Are you going to that rumbIe tonight?
-No.
Yes!
-Why?
-You must go and stop it.
I have stopped it. It'll only be a
fistfight between two of them.
Any fight is no good for us.
-Everything's good for us. We got magic.
-Listen and hear me.
You must go and stop it.
-It means that much to you?
-Yes.
-All right, I will then.
-I beIieve you.
-You do have magic.
-Of course.
I've got you.
And tonight, after I stop the rumbIe
that isn't a rumbIe, I'll come for you.
-I will wait for you on the roof.
-No.
Not the roof.
I'll come to your house.
You cannot. My mama.
-I'll take you to my house.
-Your mama?
She'll come from the kitchen
to weIcome you.
-She Iives in the kitchen.
-Dressed so eIegant?
I toId her you were coming. She'll Iook
at you. Try not to smiIe. She'll say:
''Skinny, but pretty.''
She is pIump, no doubt?
Fat.
I take after my mama. DeIicate-boned.
Not in front of Mama!
I wouId Iike to see Papa in this.
Mama will make him
ask about your prospects.
Many.
-If you go to church?
-AIways.
Yes, Papa might Iike you.
-May I have your daughter's hand?
-He says yes.
-And your mama?
-I'm afraid to ask her.
Tell her she's not getting a daughter.
She's getting rid of a son.
-She says yes.
-She has good taste.
Here. Maid of honor.
-Oh, that coIor is bad for Anita.
-The best man!
That is my papa!
Sorry, Papa.
Here we go, Riff. Womb to tomb.
Now, you see, Anita?
There was nothing to worry about.
Look! Mama's crying aIready.
I, Anton, take thee, Maria....
I, Maria, take thee, Anton....
For richer, for poorer....
In sickness and in heaIth....
To Iove and to honor....
To hoId and to keep....
From each sun to each moon....
From tomorrow to tomorrow....
From now to forever....
Till death do us part.
With this ring, I thee wed.
With this ring...
...I thee wed.
Make of our hands
One hand
Make of our hearts
One heart
Make of our vows
One last vow
Only death
Will part us now
Make of our lives
One life
Day after day
One life
Now it begins
Now we start
One hand
One heart
-Death won't part
-Even death won't part
Us now
The Jets are gonna have their day
Tonight
The Jets are gonna have their way
Tonight
The Puerto Ricans grumble
''Fair fight''
But if they start a rumble
We'll rumble 'em right
We're gonna hand 'em a surprise
Tonight
We're gonna cut 'em down to size
Tonight
We said
''Okay, no rumpus, no tricks''
But just in case they jump us
We're ready to mix
Tonight!
We're gonna rocket tonight
We're gonna jazz it up and have us a ball
They're gonna get it tonight
The more they turn it on
The harder they'll fall
-Well they began it
-Well they began it
And we're the ones
To stop 'em once and for all
Tonight!
Anita's gonna get her kicks
Tonight
We'll have our private little mix
Tonight
He'll walk in hot and tired
Poor dear
Don't matter if he's tired
As long as he's here
Tonight, tonight
Won't be just any night
Tonight there will be
No morning star
Tonight, tonight
I'll see my love tonight
And for us stars will stop
Where they are
Today the minutes seem like hours
The hours go so slowly
And still the sky is light
Oh, moon
Grow bright
And make this endless day
Endless night
The Jets are coming out on top
Tonight
We're gonna watch Bernardo drop
Tonight
That Puerto Rican punk'll
Go down
And when he's hollered ''Uncle''
We'll tear up the town
-We'll be in back of you, boy
-Right
-You're gonna flatten him good
-Right
Tonight there will be no morning star
And then we'll have a fun ball tonight
We're gonna rocket tonight
-I'll see my love tonight
-We're gonna jazz it tonight
-Late tonight
-And for us stars will stop where they are
We're gonna mix it tonight
-Today the minutes seem like hours
-They began it
-The hours go so slowly
-They began it
And still the sky is light
To stop them once and for all
The Sharks are gonna have their way
The Jets are gonna have their day
We're gonna rock it tonight
Tonight
Ready.
-Ready?
-Ready.
Ready.
-Now, move in and shake hands.
-For what?
That's the way it's done, buddy boy.
More gracious Iiving?
Every one of you hates every one of us
and we hate you. Let's get at it.
Sure.
-Here we go.
-Come on.
-Come on, Ice.
-Come on.
-Hey, punch him in the face.
-Come on!
Keep your eyes open!
HoId it!
Tony! Get with the gang.
It's all okay.
-No!
-What are you doing?
Maybe he has found the guts
to fight his own battIes.
It don't take guts if you got a battIe.
We ain't got one. None of us.
-Okay, Nardo?
-Tony!
HoId it! Let's just cooI it. The deaI
is a fair fight between you and Ice.
-Get with the gang.
-Mother hen protecting the IittIe one?
-I'll give you a battIe, gallito.
-You've got one!
I'll take pretty boy as a warm-up.
Afraid, pretty boy? Afraid, gutIess?
-Afraid, chicken?
-Cut it!
No!
-I don't wanna, Bernardo.
-Oh, I'm sure.
-Now, Iisten.
-Are you chicken?
-There's nothing to fight about.
-The hell there ain't!
-You've got it wrong!
-Chicken!
-Why can't you understand?
-Understand, chicken!
-Kill him, Tony!
-Come on!
-Come on, man.
-Come on.
-Afraid to fight?
-Come on.
-Let me see you fight.
-What's the matter?
-Chicken boy!
-Hey! He is chicken!
-Pretty boy. Listen to him!
-Don't! Stop it!
We got nothing to fight about.
-Bernardo!
-Yellow-bellied chicken!
-Don't push me!
-Come on, you yellow-bellied PoIack!
-Riff! What are you doing?
-Get outta here, Tony!
-Riff, don't!
-HoId him!
Let me go!
Riff, don't!
Keep out of this!
Somebody stop him!
Let me go!
Ice!
Tiger!
Riff!
Riff!
-Come on, Nardo!
-Stop him!
Riff, don't!
Get them!
Maria!
Tony, come on! Come on, Tony!
We gotta get out of here! Come on!
Come on, Tony! Come on!
Get out of here!
Come on!
Come on, Tony!
Wait for me, Rosa.
Chino!
There was no one downstairs.
My mother and father are at the store.
I didn't expect you, or I wouId have--
-You have been fighting, Chino?
-Yes.
-I am sorry.
-That is not Iike you.
-No.
-You must go home and wash up.
-I will see you tomorrow.
-Maria, at the rumbIe--
-There was no rumbIe.
-There was.
-Oh, no. You are wrong.
-Nobody meant for it to happen.
Tell me.
It is bad.
Very bad?
You see....
It will be easier
if you say it very fast.
There was a fight.
And Nardo....
Somehow a knife....
-And Nardo and someone, they--
-Tony.
What happened to Tony?
Chino, tell me! Is Tony all right?
He killed your brother!
You are lying.
Chino, why do you Iie to me?
Chino!
Chino!
Chino, true, you are lying! Lying!
Why do you Iie to me, Chino?
-Chino!
-Mama! Mama!
No!
Santa Maria, make it not be true.
PIease make it not be true.
Madre de Dios, I will do anything.
Make me die!
Only, pIease, make it not be true.
Make it not be--
Killer! Killer! Killer! Killer!
Killer! Killer! Killer!
I tried to stop it.
I did try.
I don't know what went wrong.
I didn't mean to hurt him.
But Riff was Iike my brother.
When Bernardo killed him, Bernardo
didn't mean it either, I-- I know.
I thought you knew.
I didn't come to tell you that.
Just for you to forgive me...
...so I can go to the poIice.
-No!
-It'll be easy now.
-I won't Iet you!
-I must.
-Stay! Stay with me.
-Maria, I Iove you so much!
-Don't Ieave me!
-Whatever you want, I'll do.
-HoId me!
-Oh, forever!
-Tighter.
-It'll be all right. I know it.
We're really together now.
But it's not us.
It's everything around us.
Then I'll take you away,
where nothing can get to us.
Not anyone or anything.
There's a place
For us
Somewhere
A place for us
Peace and quiet
And open air
Wait for us
Somewhere
There's a time
For us
Someday a time for us
Time together with time to spare
Time to look
Time to care
Someday
Somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere
There's a place for us
A time and place for us
Hold my hand
And we're halfway there
Hold my hand
And I'll take you there
Somehow
Someday
Somewhere
Baby John, what are you doing here?
Nothing.
What are you doing nothing here for?
Come on.
I don't want the guys to see me, A-rab.
Why not?
Well, I'm crying.
You are?
What for?
-I don't know. I'm just--
-BIow your nose.
-A-rab?
-Yeah?
Did you get a Iook at their faces?
-Which faces?
-You know....
At the rumbIe. Riff and Bernardo.
Yeah.
-I wish it was yesterday.
-Me too. I'm scared.
-Cut it out. You hear me?
-A-rab, what are we gonna do?
We'll meet the other guys and form up.
Now, come on. Let's go.
-Hey. You got a handkerchief first?
-What's wrong with your sIeeve?
-Where you been?
-Where you think? The Stork CIub?
-We thought they nabbed you.
-Go on.
-You didn't see Tony?
-Nothing but coppers.
-What's wrong with him?
-There's nothing wrong. He's okay!
All right, all right!
-Maybe we ought to go home.
-For what?
-Bet you they got him.
-Not Tony.
-Man, he was great. Right, Baby John?
-Yeah.
-He really come through for the Jets.
-Just Iike Riff said he--
Said he wouId.
Riff! I want Riff!
Come on, Graziella.
Gee. Nobody was

Okay.
Let's go.
Where we going?
If we Iay Iow, the coppers
are gonna smell fish.
-So the first thing we do--
-Hey, buddy boys!
-Aw, go wear a skirt.
-I got scabby knees. Listen--
We show around
Iike we got nothing to hide.
Suppose they ask us about the rumbIe.
Suppose they ask where's Tony and what
party's Iooking for him? With a gun!
-You know something?
-I know I gotta go get a skirt.
-Come on!
-What's the freak know?
PIenty! I figured somebody ought to
infiItrate PR territory and spy around.
I'm very Iarge with shadows.
I can sIip in and out of them
Iike wind through a fence.
-Is she making the most of it!
-You bet your fat ''A'' I am!
-Spill it!
-Okay.
I hear Chino telling the Sharks
about Tony and Bernardo's sister.
Then I hear Chino say, ''If it's the Iast
thing I do, I'm gonna get that PoIack.''
And then he pulls out the bad news.
-Gee!
-Them PRs won't stop.
-Till we stop them.
-HoId it!
Now, Iisten...
...Tony come through for us.
We gotta come through for Tony.
-We gotta find him before Chino does.
-And burns him.
-You cover the river. Snowboy, Doc's.
-I'll take the alleys.
-We'll take the streets.
-The park.
-The schoolyard.
-The pIayground.
-Let's go.
-What about me?
You? In and out of the shadows.
-Maybe you'll find Tony in one of them.
-Right!
Hey!
You done good, buddy boy.
Thanks, daddy-o.
Who is--?
Maria.
Maria?
Maria, it's Anita. Are you in there?
-Maria?
-Yes.
Open the door. I need you.
No.
-Now you are afraid too?
-What?
I'll be right there.
We'll go. Meet me as soon as possibIe.
We'll run away.
-Together.
-But where?
The bus station.
We'll go so far they'll never find us.
-How can we?
-Doc will heIp. I'll get money from him.
-Meet me at his store.
-At Doc's, yes.
-I'll wait.
-All right.
-Maria.
-Yes.
Hurry!
-Maria!
-Coming, Anita.
Anita--
-All right. Now you know.
-And you still don't know.
He is one of them!
-No, Anita!
-Yes!
A boy like that
Would kill your brother
Forget that boy
And find another
One of your own kind
Stick to your own kind
A boy like that
Will give you sorrow
You'll meet another boy
Tomorrow
One of your own kind
Stick to your own kind
A boy who kills cannot love
A boy who kills has no heart
And he's the boy who gets your love
And gets your heart
Very smart, Maria
Very smart
A boy like that
Wants one thing only
And when he's done
He'll leave you lonely
He'll murder your love
He murdered mine
Just wait and see
Just wait, Maria
-Just wait and see
-Oh, no, Anita, no
Anita, no
It isn't true, not for me
It's true for you, not for me
I hear your words
And in my head, I know they're smart
But my heart, Anita
But my heart
Knows they're wrong
You should know better
You were in love
Or so you said
You should know better
I have a love
And it's all that I have
Right or wrong
What else can I do?
I love him
I'm his
And everything he is
I am too
I have a love
And it's all that I need
Right or wrong
And he needs me too
I love him
We're one
There's nothing to be done
Not a thing I can do
But hold him
Hold him forever
Be with him now
Tomorrow
And all
Of my life
When love comes
So strong
There is no right or wrong
Your love is
Your life
Chino has a gun.
I heard the boys taIking.
-He's hunting for Tony.
-He's at Doc's store, waiting for me.
If Chino hurts him,
if he touches him, I swear I'll--
-You'll do what Tony did to Bernardo?
-I Iove Tony.
I know.
I Ioved Bernardo.
-Anybody home?
-Yes.
-Bernardo's sister, pIease.
-She isn't feeIing well.
Who is?
Hello, miss.
I'm Lt. Schrank. I don't Iike
to disturb you at a time Iike this--
Yes, a very bad time.
If you'll excuse me, pIease.
-I have a coupIe of questions to ask.
-Afterwards, pIease.
-I must go to my brother.
-One minute!
-Can't you wait?
-No!
Now.
-You were at the dance Iast night--
-Will this take Iong?
As Iong as it has to.
Excuse me.
Anita, my headache is much worse.
-Will you go to Doc's store?
-Don't you peopIe keep aspirin around?
This is something speciaI.
Will you go for me, Anita?
What shall I ask for?
Doc will know.
Tell him I have been detained
and can't get there right away...
...or I wouId have picked it up myseIf.
Excuse me. You were asking?
Yeah. At the gym Iast night, your
brother got into a heavy argument...
...because you danced
with the wrong boy.
-Yes.
-Who was the boy?
-Another from my country.
-And his name?
Jose.
-Can't find him.
-He's down there in the cellar.
-Tony?
-Safe and sound.
-I found him.
-You warn him about Chino?
-What's he doing in the cellar?
-Keeping the mice company.
-No sign of Chino?
-Nothing.
His Iuck.
I'll check the alleys again.
You hang here.
-Right.
-Okay.
-Boy, I'm thirsty. Where's Doc?
-Upstairs raising money for Tony.
-Doc ain't got no money.
-His mattress has.
Come on. Cut the frabber-jabber.
Grab some reading matter. PIay the juke.
Some of you get outside.
If you see Chino or those stinking PRs--
-I'd Iike to see Doc.
-He ain't here.
-Where is he?
-He went to the bank.
-They made a mistake in his favor.
-The banks are cIosed. Where is he?
You know how skinny Doc is. He sIipped
in through the night deposit sIot.
And got stuck haIfway in.
Which indicates there's
no telling when he'll be back.
Where you going?
-Downstairs.
-Didn't I tell you he ain't here?
I'd Iike to see for myseIf.
PIease.
PIease.
-Will you Iet me pass?
-She's too dark to pass.
-Don't.
-PIease don't.
-Listen, you!
-We're Iistening.
Look, I gotta give
a friend of yours a message.
-I gotta tell Tony--
-He ain't here.
-I know he is.
-Who says he is?
-Who's it from?
-Never mind.
-CouIdn't be from Chino, couId it?
-Don't you understand? I want to heIp!
-Bernardo's girI wants to heIp?
-Even a greaseball's got feeIings.
-But she wants to heIp get Tony.
-No!
-Not much. Bernardo's tramp.
-Bernardo's pig!
-You lying spic!
-Don't do that.
-GoId tooth!
-Pierced ear!
-Don't!
-GarIic mouth.
-I want to heIp!
-Come on!
Come on!
-Let's get her!
-Oh, no, you don't.
-Come on.
-Come on!
Stop it!
What are you doing there?
Bernardo was right.
If one of you was lying
in the street bIeeding...
...I'd waIk by and spit on you!
-She'll tell Chino Tony's in the cellar!
-Don't you touch me!
I got a message
for your American buddy.
You tell that murderer
that Maria's never going to meet him!
You tell him that Chino
found out about them...
...and shot her!
She's dead!
When do you kids stop?
You make this worId Iousy!
We didn't make it, Doc.
Get out of here.
Maria?
Doc, I thought I heard--
You got it!
-Yes, I got it.
-Doc, you're a paI.
You're the best friend a guy ever had.
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
-Forget that.
-No, I'll never! I couIdn't.
You know what we're gonna
do in the country, Maria and me?
We'll have kids and name them after you.
Even the girIs, so when you visit--
Wake up!
Is this the only way
to get through to you?
Do just what you all do,
bust Iike a hot-water pipe?
What's got into you?
Why do you kids Iive
Iike there's a war on?
Why do you kill?
I toId you how it happened.
Maria understands.
-I thought you did too.
-Maria understands nothing.
Ever again.
There is no Maria, Tony.
What?
-I can't.
-No, no, Doc.
Now, tell me. What is it?
That was Anita upstairs.
Chino found out about you and Maria...
...and he killed her.
Maria....
Not Maria, Doc.
She's....
Chino! Chino!
Come and get me too, Chino!
Chino!
Chino!
-Chino! Come and get me too, Chino!
-Tony!
-Who's that?
-Anybodys. Come on.
Get out of here!
-Chino, come and get me, damn you!
-What are you doing?
Get out of here! Chino!
Come with me. We'll find--
It ain't pIaying anymore!
Can't you get that?
-But the gang--
-You're a girI! Be a girI and beat it!
Chino!
Come on, Chino! Get me too!
Chino!
Chino! I'm calling for you, Chino!
There's nobody here but me.
Come on!
PIease, will you?
I'm waiting for you.
I want you to.
Maria?
Tony!
Maria.
Maria!
Maria!
I didn't beIieve hard enough.
Loving is enough.
Not here.
-They won't Iet us be.
-Then we'll get away.
Yeah.
-We can.
-Yes.
-We will.
-Yes.
Hold my hand
And we're halfway there
Hold my hand
And I'll take you there
Somehow
Someday
Some....
Stay back!
How do you fire this gun, Chino?
Just by pulling this IittIe trigger?
How many bullets are Ieft, Chino?
Enough for you?
And you?
All of you!
You all killed him.
And my brother and Riff.
Not with bullets and guns.
With hate!
Well, I can kill too
because now I have hate!
How many can I kill, Chino? How many?
And still have one bullet Ieft for me?
No!
Don't you touch him!
