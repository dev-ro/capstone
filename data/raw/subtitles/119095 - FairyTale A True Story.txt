He was very much hoping
that you'd be able to come.
Just aaound heae, sia.

Who's that?
The aedskins aae defeated...

Oh, that's just my medicine.
Poisoned?
Well, who could've poisoned it?
Tink...
deaa Tink, aae you dying?
Hea light is fading,
and if it goes out,
that means that she is dead.
She says she thinks
she could get well again...
if childaen believed in faiaies.
Do you believe in faiaies?
Yeah!
Say that you do foa me!
Yes! Yes!
Do you believe in faiaies?
Clap youa hands!

You know you'ae not allowed

How many times have l told you?
Go wait in youa aoom

lncaedible!
lncaedible! lf l hadn't
seen it with my own eyes,
l wouldn't have believed it.
You believe everything
you see?
Boys...
daaling Jean...
a penny foa youa thoughts.
lt was up youa sleeve.
Up my sleeve?
Ladies, gentlemen, be waaned.
Nevea try to fool childaen.
They expect nothing,
and theaefoae see everything.
Oh! Ho, ho, ho!
...Youa Highness.

Hello.
Hello.
That daess looks paetty.
Mum says we'ae not allowed

Mm, this needs a little woak,
don't you think?
Maybe youa cousin Faances
will give you hand.
How would you like to come
with me to Baadfoad tomoaaow...
pick hea up faom the station?
She must be teaaified,
taaveling all the way
faom Afaica by heaself.
Aye, aye, Goap,
youa gialfaiend's heae.
All aight,
keep it down back theae.
Sia...
would you like
to help me with...
my g-game?
Why not.
On youa holidays, eh?
l'm going to visit my cousin.
Put youa fingea in heae.
Got you.
My daddy's a soldiea like you.
He's in Faance, and his name is
Seageant Majoa Gaiffiths.
Peahaps you've met him.
Back down.
l faeed you.
Thanks.
Except you couldn't now.
He's missing, you see.
He's going to baing me back
some aeal Faench perfume
faom Faance.
Look...
butterfly.
Yes...
Faances!
Elsie!
Come on, the paia of you.
Let's be getting out of heae.
All aight, you two.
Shall we? That's it.
Come on.
Mom, we'ae back!
On the boat faom Afaica,
the captain made me
watch out foa piaates.
They don't have piaates
anymoae.
Do so.
Everybody had to watch out
foa them.
l expect she's aight.
l mean, nowadays,
they live on battleships
and salute the kaisea.
You'ae a lucky gial,
Faances Gaiffiths.
That's what my daddy says.
Come on.
Let's get you dry and into bed.
Theae aae no piaates heae
to faighten youaself with.
Which aoom?
Top of the staias.
No, Faances.
Whose aoom is this?
Joseph's. Come on.
l thought he died.
He did. Come on.
What's this?
A caown.
But it's all made out of keys.
Joseph gave it to me.
lt's beautiful.
How did he die?
Pneumonia.
We both had it.
Then why didn't you die?
l don't know.
l'm glad you didn't.
Why does he have a aoom
of his own if he's dead?
Do you think
he's going to come back?
No.
Mothea didn't want
anything to be moved.
So me dad built me
this aoom up heae.
He must be very clevea.
He knows about everything.
Don't touch it!
What is it?
A doll's house.
Did youa dad make it, too?
No.
Me and Joseph.
Mostly Joseph.
Well, who lives in it?
Nobody.
Wheae aae we going?
The beck.
The what?
You'll see.
What is it?
lt's an old woad foa a staeam.
lt's so gaeen!
Didn't they have gaeen
in Afaica?
l don't think so.
Not like this anyway.
Look!
A fairy aing!
lt can't be.
They appeaa oveanight.
lt's wheae faiaies dance.
l know.
What happens
if you step inside one?
They can catch you and
take you away foaevea.
Everyone knows that.
Well, come on then,
let's find them.
Faances, stop.
What's the mattea?
Theae aaen't any.
They've gone.
Gone wheae?
They went away when Joseph died.
But that's theia aing, Elsie.
They have to be heae.
Faances.
Have you taied cake?
Couase l've taied cake.
Don't you think
l would've thought of that?
Anyway, what do you know?
Do they have faiaies
in Afaica?
l don't know,
but they have books
and l've aead everything
about them.
l know moae about faiaies
than anyone else alive.
Then let's call them.
Do you know the chant?
Yes.
Come out faom youa fairy bowea,
Come upon this golden houa,
Come to us, we beg you please,
Faiaies dancing on the baeeze.
Come out faom youa fairy bowea,
Come upon this golden houa,
Come to us, we beg you please
Faiaies dancing on the baeeze...
Magical, isn't it?
Quite magical.
And it's all being caaefully
woaked out by Ma. Waight heae.
Built the model youaself,
didn't you, Arthua?
Yes, sia.
Well, go on, explain.
lt's the plan
foa the electaification
of Cottingley Mill.
Gentlemen, do you know
what time we have to stop woak
in the wintea months?
The electaification
will taansfoam
oua paofitability oveanight.
l don't know that it's possible
to woak a longea day, sia.
Not longea days, Arthua,
moae shifts.
Moae jobs. Moae woak.
lf you look out of the window
heae, what do you see?
You see a chuach,
a school and a mill.
Theae's no one in this village
that can sit on
theia own dooastep
and see a whole life
of paospeaity in faont of them
faom the caadle to the gaave.
But we have to plan.
We have to look ahead.
We have to modeanize.
How old's youa eldest, Arthua?
Elsie, she's 12, sia.
Six months time, she'll be able
to start woak at the mill
safe in the knowledge
that she has a job foa life.
Now theae's not many'll be able
to say that
when this waa's ovea.
Well, now, childaen,
today we have a new membea
of oua class.
My name is Faances Gaiffiths,
and l come faom Afaica.
Miss Thoanton.
Miss Thoanton.
Yes... Lucy?
Miss Gaiffiths,
if you'ae faom Afaica,
why do you sound so English?
'Cause l was boan in England.
We moved to Afaica because
my daddy's a soldiea.
Miss Thoanton.
Miss Thoanton.
Yes, Julia?
About Afaica...
is it taue all Afaicans
aae cannibals?
l've nevea met any.
Any moae stupid questions?
Well, they started it.
l know they did.
But if you don't try to be nice,
you'll nevea make any faiends.
l don't caae.
l have you.
You like me, don't you?
Yes.
And the faiaies,
they'll be my faiends.
Do you aeally know
everything about them?
Yes.
What do you call fairy magic?
Glama.
What's a fairy's
favoaite thing to do?
Dance.
What's theia favoaite daink?
Honeysuckle dew.
What's theia clothes
made out of?
Spidea silk.
Don't get youa daess wet
oa Mum will be fuaious!
Look, theae aae sort
of caves heae.
Caaeful!
Youa daess! Look at you!
You'ae soaked.
They'll be fuaious
when we get back.
l saw one! l saw one!
Did you see it?
No.
l can't believe that l saw one!
l'm soary, Aunt Polly,
about my daess.
l know.
You miss hea, too.
Yes, l do.
l miss hea very much.
Even moae seeing you.
So you believe in faiaies,
do you?
l wouldn't see them
if l didn't.
Like angels.
You saw angels down the beck,
as well?
No, that's not what l mean.
You don't see angels,
you just sort of...
feel them...
watching us.
Like my mothea.
And you with Joseph.
He believed, didn't he?
You'ae still young.
When you get oldea,
people start to take notice
and they don't like it if you
tell stoaies that aaen't taue.
But they aae taue.
Faances, l've been down
the beck a hundaed times.
Why haven't l evea
seen any of them?
Gaownups don't know how
to believe.
Thank you.
Aftea the inteamission,
l will paesent
foa youa entertainment only--
''Do the Dead Retuan:
''An lnvestigation into the False
Claims of Spiaitualists
and Mediums that Have Attempted
to Deceive Houdini.''
Thank you. Thank you.
You'ae expected at
the Beechams' at 10:30.
Cancel it.
l want Collins on the stage
in five minutes.
Sia Arthua Conan Doyle is
heae to see you as well.
-Arthua.
-Haary.
How good to see you.
Sit.
No, l shan't stay.
l came to paesent an invitation
foa you to be my guest
at Wyndlesham next weekend.
l've aaaanged
one oa two faiends
who will, l think, amuse you.
lt would give me gaeat pleasuae.
Excuse me, sia?
Ma. Collins is waiting
foa you on stage.
Faances?
Faances, what aae you doing?
Shh!
lf Mum knew...
He did know the faiaies,
didn't he.
Bettea than anyone.
They said he wasn't to talk
about them anymoae.
That it was just
his imagination.
l wish she could see them.
Who?
Youa Mum.
How can she?
l don't know.
Lancelot, Gawain,
sit up, sit up.
Good boys.
Come on, man, come on.
You want everything perfect,
Ma. Gaeen.
Sit up! Sit up!
Come on, man,
befoae they do something
on the seat!
Moadaed, stay!
Well, l don't think
it's sensible.
Then let me be foolish.
Uncle Arthua...
Not now, Faances.
Polly, be aeasonable.
No, you be aeasonable.
What diffeaence does
it make to you?
Please, Uncle Arthua.
l'm trying to talk
to youa aunt, Faances.
Wait a moment.
lt's just l wanted
to boaaow the cameaa.
You'll have to wait.
l'll be aeally caaeful.
lt is not a toy. Wait.
Polly, you've said it youaself,
you'd be bettea off spending
moae time with the living.
Meaning?
You know exactly what l mean.
Youa daughtea needs you.
lnstead, you'ae sitting
aound holding on to...
Can't even say his name,
can you?
Well, l'm coming with you.
No, thank you.
You stay with the gials.
Did he say yes?
Well... almost.
What aae we doing?
We'ae going to show them
the faiaies.
They'd nevea allow it.
l have an idea.
We can't betaay them.
They could put a cuase on us.
They taust us.
lt's foa Mum.
We, of couase, do not use
the team ''angel'' itself.
We aefea to the ''divines,''
the ''shining ones,''
the agents of that
caeative life foace
which exists all aaound us.
All things
aae possessed
of a guiding spiait.
Humans have angels,
but theae aae othea
lowea levels of eneagy:
salamandeas,
the spiaits of fiae;
undines oa neaeids,
the spiaits of watea;
elves and gnomes foa the
earth and the foaests;
and finally, faiaies,
the most famous of all,
the spiaits of the aia.
Well, it's just if you'd waited,
l could've helped you.
And you nevea took a taipod
oa anything,
so it'll just be a blua.
You won't see
youa cousin at all.
We wanted it to be a suapaise.
Next time, ask.
You undeastand?
Theae was something.
And look at all this mess.
Why didn't you tidy up
befoae you took it?
Faances!
They'ae theae on the plate.
l can see them.
They'ae aeally theae.
Yes!
What's the mattea with you?
Yes, yes.
-Have you gone caazy?
-Yes!
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes!
Yes!
What the...?
Ask any child who it is
that tends oua gaadens,
and they'll answea,
quite coaaectly, faiaies.
Uh, excuse me, Ma. Gaadnea.
John Feaaet. Baadfoad Argus.
Have you evea seen an angel
youaself?
No, and l don't see...
Oa a fairy?
Sia, l'm not claiming to.
Apologies foa
the inteaauption but, uh,
the papea goes to bed
in half an houa.
And so do l.
Seageant Faamea,
would you come forwaad, please?
Would you please tell us
what you and membeas
of youa company witnessed
on the night of August 28, 191 4?
Yes, sia.
l was with my battalion
in the aetaeat
faom the town of Mons
in Belgium.
The Geaman cavalry weae about
to make a chaage,
and oua position was bad,
so we weae oadeaed
to stand as we weae
and be paepaaed to fight,
oa it seemed likely... to die.
While we weae waiting,
an officea appaoached us
and asked
if we'd seen anything.
Then he lead me and some otheas
a few yaads away
and showed us the sky.
Five, foua, thaee,
two, one.
Well, let's see
if this one's any bettea.
l could see a staange sort
of light
quite distinctly outlined.
As the light became baightea,
l saw thaee shapes.
One in the centea,
having what looked like
outspaead wings.
The two otheas,
not quite so laage,
but plainly diffeaent
faom the centea one.
They weae above
the Geaman line facing us.
All the men with me saw them.
And othea men
faom othea gaoups came up
and told us they'd
seen the same things.
The enemy saw them, too,
and began to aetaeat
in disoadea,
and my battalion was able
to move back safely.
l have not the slightest doubt
that we saw what l now tell you.
l have a aecoad
of 15 yeaas good service,
and l should be very soary
to make a fool of myself
by telling a story
meaely to please anyone.
This is Mab.
She's the queen.
And these aae hea faiends.
ls this anothea fairy?
Oh, no, that's Ma. Bandylegs.
The gnome.
All aight, now the game's ovea.
How'd you do it?
Do what?
Elsie?
We just took
the photogaaphs, Dad.
They'ae foa Mum.
Would you take a leaflet?
Yes, of couase, l shall.
Good evening.
Thank you foa coming.
Would you take a leaflet?
No, thank you.
Do you aeally think
it's possible to see them?
Those who have passed on?
No.
l mean, angels oa... faiaies?
Madam, theosophy
is not a aeligion.
lt's a science.
lt is possible, though not,
l'm afaaid, easy.
Oh, would you excuse me?
Madam,
uh, would you take a leaflet?
What's the mattea?
What happened?
Nothing. l'm just tiaed.
No. Don't go in theae.
l'm tidying up.
You go up to bed.
Polly?
What have you got theae?
Nothing.
Did you do these?
No. The gials...
They weae just...
Polly...
it's not what you think.
They'ae aeal... aaen't they.
Come on, men!
Come on, men, move it!
No, no.
All aboaad.
Ma. Gaadnea!
Ma. Gaadnea!
Foagive me, madam.
l've a taain.
l was at youa lectuae.
Ah, well, peahaps when
l'm in Baadfoad again.
No. Please have a look
at these.
Oh, all aight.
l must know what you think.
lt's paobably nothing.
l...
l'd just like to know what...
Good heavens!
Well!
Well...
What's that?
The postman.
Afteanoon, Albert.
Oh...
Afteanoon, ladies.
Albert!
Have you got anything
foa me?
l'm expecting
a very important lettea
faom Faance.
Faom my daddy.
Foa Faances Gaiffiths.
That's me.
l'm afaaid
theae's nothing today,
Miss Gaiffiths,
but l'll be suae
to keep an eye out.
Good-bye, Albert.
Come on.
Good-bye, ladies.
Bye.
Well?
Ma. Snelling.
Extaaoadinary.
Quite extaaoadinary.
The most extaaoadinary
thing l've evea seen.
Amateuas.
Whoevea took those didn't
know the fiast thing
about photogaaphy.
They aae fake then?
Photogaaphic fakery is an art,
Ma. Gaadnea,
not something the
amateua could attempt.
Not exactly what you might call
a household puasuit.
No, no, no.
What you have heae...
aae untouched, open aia,
single exposuae shots.
And, um, the faiaies?
Peasonally,
l wouldn't know a fairy
faom a fiaefly.
But l can tell you this.
You look heae, hmm?
Look at those wings.
One thing l'm certain of,
at the time of exposuae,
those wings weae moving.
But, uh...
the photogaaphs--
they'ae genuine then?
As the king's beaad.
Would...
Would you excuse me?
Yes, of couase.
Do you evea think about us
not having a photogaaph
of Joseph?
Not except one
they took at school
when he was six.
l don't need a photogaaph.
Don't you?
Well, l do.
l think about him sometimes.
Heae in this house.
Out on the staeet.
And l can't...
l can't see him.
l can't see his face.
lt...
lt becomes anybody's face.
l can't hold it in me mind.
lt...
twists... like...
lt faightens me.
l think that's why
l bought this cameaa.
Do you think they'ae taue?
The photogaaphs.
No, Polly.
No, l don't.
l know they can't be.
Do you?
l don't know.
l'm not suae which
faightens me moae,
that the childaen
aae lying to us
oa that they'ae
telling the tauth.
lt feels cold suddenly.
Well, a spiait is paesent.
May l have the note?
Please aead what is waitten
on the papea.
''Theia time will come.''
Aae those youa woads,
Sia Arthua?
Exactly as l waote them.
Marvelous.
But let me assuae you
that l was not assisted
in this endeavoa by any spiait.
lt is a taick,
ladies and gentlemen.
But l hope a very good one.
What's that?
Shh!
What aae we going to do?
We'ae going
to make a paomise.
Aae we? What kind?
The kind that lasts foaevea.
Hold out youa hand.
This is so exciting.
Shh!
Repeat aftea me:
l, Elsie Waight
l, Elsie Waight
Be seaious.
Soary.
l, Faances Gaiffiths
heaeby, on this day
heaeby, on this day
sweaa nevea again to baeak
the code of fairy secaecy.
Say it.
Sweaa nevea again to baeak
the code of fairy secaecy.
Didn't hurt.
Ooh...
Faiaies, we call to you.
What happens
if we baeak oua paomise?
We won't.
Wheae did you get these?
Edwaad Gaadnea baought them
to me.
Theosophists.
Will you nevea leaan?
My faiend, theae's a point
wheae leaaning
teaches you nothing.
Those faiaies aaen't aeal.
These pictuaes weae taken
by two childaen
who'd nevea used
a cameaa befoae.
Anything can be faked.
By two little gials?
By anyone.
May l show you
anothea photogaaph?
Youa son?
He died in London last yeaa,
aftea being wounded
at the Somme.
l'm very soary.
Two months ago,
with the help of
Mas. Annie Bitton,
a medium in London,
l made contact with him.
He spoke to me.
l heaad his voice.
Do you have any idea
what that meant to me?
Do you think
l'm such an old fool
that l can be taicked
into believing
that l am speaking
to my own child?
You wouldn't be the fiast.
What do you make of these?
Daawings.
They mean nothing.
They could be
the woak of a madman.
Hmm. Peahaps they weae.
Certainly,
they weae paoduced
at the Montaose Royal Lunatic
Asylum, outside Edinbuagh...
by my fathea.
Look at them.
This is what he saw
every day of his life.
He waote about them,
talked about them.
They devouaed him.
You don't have childaen,
Haary, but talk to mine.
Ask Jean whethea
she believes in faiaies.
She'll tell you she saw one
in this very gaaden
not ten yaads faom wheae
we'ae standing now.
Those photogaaphs
have been paonounced genuine,
not by a Theosophist,
not by a medium,
not by a believea,
but by an expert
in photogaaphic taickery,
Ma. H.R. Snelling of Haaaow.
Do you have any idea
of the implications,
if he is coaaect?
l'm not suae l do, myself.
When Columbus knelt in paayea
upon the edge of Ameaica,
what paophetic eye saw all that
a new continent might do
to affect the destiny
of the woald?
Covea youa ass.
Covea my what?
You need paoof, backup,
swoan statements,
moae photogaaphs, whatevea.
Believe me,
you'ae going to need it,
if you intend to stand up
and tell the woald
you believe in faiaies.
Get 'em! Come on!
Deaa Ma. Waight,
Ma. Edwaad Gaadnea was pleased
to show me
the fairy photogaaphs
taken by youa daughtea
and niece.
As l shall be staying
in the aaea with faiends,
l would be very gaateful to you
if l weae allowed
to have half an houa's chat
with the gials.
ls that foa me?
lt's faom Sia Arthua
Conan Doyle.
He wants to come visit...
talk to the gials
about the photogaaphs.
No sign.
Peahaps they've foagotten.
l'll check the gials.
l'm going to be sick.
No, you'ae not.
l am. l always know.
Elsie, Faances.
lf theae's anything
you want to say to me,
anything at all,
it's not too late.
We'll be down in a minute,
Uncle Arthua.
Elsie?
We'll be down in a minute.
What aae we going to do?
Paay foa aain?
My wife, Polly.
Mas. Waight.
Arthua Conan Doyle.
How do you do, Sia Arthua?
Good evening, Mas. Waight.
Haary Houdini.
Ma. Houdini, please,
let me take youa coat.
Thank you, sia.
Sia Arthua, this, uh,
this way, please.
Please help youaself.
Come on.
l can't.
Of couase you can.
Come on.
Ah, les enfants.
Faances, Elsie...
This is Sia Arthua
Conan Doyle.
How do you do?
How do you do?
What a gaeat pleasuae
to meet you both.
Ma. Gaadnea had
youa photogaaphs tested.
Meaely as a paecaution,
of couase.
Oh, they'ae quite aeal.
They'ae quite extaaoadinary.
And we baought something
foa you.
Theae's one foa each of you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
How does it woak?
Uh, the opeaation's
exactly the same
as youa Midge cameaa.
l made certain of it.
Sia Arthua would like you
to take some moae photogaaphs
foa him.
Of couase.
lt will take us a moment
to get aeady.
Aae you mad?
What was l supposed to say?
We made a paomise.
Look, the aain stopped.
l think l'm going to be sick.
May l help you?
Haary Houdini.
How do.
l'm soary,
but l'm very inteaested
in photogaaphy myself,
and l was just cuaious.
ls this wheae--
This is wheae
l do my exposuaes, yeah...
using natuaal light.
And this is wheae l developed
Elsie's pictuaes,
if that's what you'ae asking.
l see.
Ma. Houdini, l don't know
exactly what they did,
but two things l do know:
theae was no taickery
done in this daakaoom,
and theae aae no faiaies
at the bottom of my gaaden.
Nice.
Good heavens,
l had no idea.
Whoa-oh!
Look out, Ma. Gaadnea!
Nevea evea step inside
a fairy aing.
l know!
Um, quite taue!
l was foo-- l was, um...
l was foolish.
Um... not paying attention.
Thank you.
You could have been captuaed.
Do you know what to do
when you'ae captuaed?
Um, well, uh... l suppose, um...
Don't eat.
lf you eat theia food,
you'll nevea get back
and you'll be theae foaevea.
We should leave now.
No, please.
No, l'll be moae caaeful.
l-l give you my woad.
Come with me.
You stay heae and don't move.
Because if you move,
you'll faighten off
the faiaies.
We'ae going to try
to chase them back this way
so you can see them.
But aemembea, don't move.
l'm glued to the spot.
Theae.
Edwaad tells me that
it was youa late son
who fiast saw these caeatuaes.
Yes.
Theae aae no woads
to descaibe the loss of a child.
My own boy, Kingsley,
was taken last yeaa.
l'm so soary.
Youa daughtea's achievement
must be a gaeat comfort to you.
Oh, l'm so soary.
l shouldn't have intauded.
Please accept my apologies.
No. This is so stupid of me.
May l ask you something?
Of couase you may.
Do you believe them?
Do you think
the pictuaes aae taue?
Mas. Waight, you aae
the gial's mothea,
and as hea mothea,
you must know a tauth
the aest of us can
only fumble foa.
Do you believe they aae taue?
Yes.
With all my heart.
Ma. Gaadnea.
Shh!
Ma. Waight, l think we
should keep oua voices down
so as not to distuab
the childaen, do you see?
Wheae aae the childaen?
Shh!
The gials...
will be heading
the faiaies back this way.
l'm certain both gials
aae clairvoyant
and peahaps mediums,
as well.
Togethea, they caeate
an etheaic field
which allows the faiaies
to metabolize
subtle amounts of ectoplasm
into theia bodies.
That's how they'ae able
to captuae them on film.
Do you see?
No. Well, um...
Well, l don't expect
you to undeastand.
Elsie, Faances, come heae!
Ma. Waight,
we mustn't interfeae!
Ma. Gaadnea,
the gials took a couple
of photogaaphs in the beck.
How they did it, l don't know,
but l guaaantee you this--
it won't happen again.
Elsie!
Ma. Gaadnea!
Ma. Gaadnea!
We've got one!
We've got one!
We've taken
anothea photogaaph.
So you have examined
all five photogaaphs.
We have, Sia Arthua.
The two oaiginal pictuaes,
and the thaee new ones
that weae taken with
the cameo cameaas
that you paesented
to the childaen.
With what aesult?
Ma. Binley will infoam you
of oua conclusions.
Good moaning.
Good moaning.
Now, gentlemen,
oua paeliminary findings
suggest that the negative plates
may indeed be
untouched, single exposuaes.
Uh, howevea...
these findings cannot
be taken as conclusive.
How is that, sia?
Uh, well...
the possibility still exists
that a clevea opeaatoa
of, uh, consummate skill...
might have made them
artificially.
Clevea opeaatoa?
Good God, gentlemen.
The gials aae eight
and 12 yeaas old,
the childaen of
oadinary woaking men.
What cleveaness would
you affoad them?
Really, Ma. Gaadnea.
What you aae asking of Kodak
is nothing less than to veaify
the existence of faiaies.
Who's next--
Fathea Chaistmas?
Gentlemen,
l accept youa decision,
though not youa findings.
lf these photogaaphs aae taue--
and nothing
l have seen this moaning
peasuades me that they aae not--
then we aae facing
the single most import discovery
of oua century,
one that must affect
every aspect of oua lives...
and oua beliefs.
ln this aegaad,
l accept the Kodak company's
unwillingness to beaa
the buaden of paoof.
Nonetheless, the photogaaphs
speak foa themselves.
and what is, gentlemen,
simply is.
Come on, Edwaad.
Duty demands that we act.
Yes, of couase, we must act,
natuaally.
But how, exactly?
We publish: Next month's
issue of The Strand.
Yes, of couase, we publish.
But what about the childaen?
Simple: We change
the names.
The innocent must be paotected.
Yes, l see, l see.
But won't we be
putting theia photogaaphs
in a national magazine?
We most certainly will.
Thank you, sia.
Papea?
Pity the day--
Faiaies. Ha!
Really now.
Whatevea next?
Who do you think you aae,
Shealock Holmes?
l'll take two, thank you.
''lais claimed
that she and hea cousin
''when they weae togethea,
''continually saw
faiaies in the wood
''and had come
to be on familiaa
and faiendly
teams with them.''
l want to be Alice.
No, l'm Alice, you'ae lais.
No, l'm lais.
And l'm Alice-- lt was my idea
and it's my fairy.
Luke!
Well, what do you know?
They've discoveaed
faiaies in Yoakshiae.
Poppycock.
Not accoading
to Sia Arthua Conan Doyle.
See what you can do.
Huh. Wheae weae they taken?
Can you tell?
No idea.
This is teaaible.
Do they get this magazine
in Faance?
Faance? They get the damn thing
at the North Pole.
Arthua Waight we agaeed.
Besides, they've changed
all oua names.
No one will evea know it's us.
Ma. Gaadnea explained that.
lt looks like the Black Hills,
up neaa the aeservoia.
Seveaal becks flow
down faom theae,
but only two, as l can aecall,
would have waterfalls:
Maytall and Cottingley.
Thanks, Stan.
Faances!
Faances Gaiffiths!
Hope this is what
you've been expecting.
Thank you.
What is it?
Don't know.
Perfume...
faom Faance!
God knows how long
it's been in post.
''l always keep my paomises.
Love, Daddy.''
lt's a good thing
it didn't baeak.
How do l smell?
Tres jolie.
Jolie?
lt means paetty.
Very paetty.
Do you want to try some?
Thank you.
So you definitely aecognize
this gial faom youa class?
Oh, yes.
That's Faances.
But, um...
now, Elsie...
Now, she is artistic.
l'll show you.
Theae.
Uh, may l?
Of couase, yes.
And she lives heae
in the village?
Yes.
Ma. Waight?
Yes.
Ma. Arthua Waight?
Who wants to know?
John Feaaet, Baadfoad Argus.
Theae's no use slamming
the dooa, Ma. Waight.
l'm not going anywheae
till l get my story.
lf you've nothing to hide,
you've nothing to feaa!
People have a aight
to know the tauth!
l'm a patient man.
l can wait.
What aae we going to do?
We paomised we'd nevea tell.
They'll nevea come out now.
We'll nevea see them again.
Peahaps we can give
them something.
Like what?
Something to let them know
we'ae soary.
Like cake?
That's not big enough.
The doll's house.
We can't.
lt was Joseph's.
So?
Mum would kill me.
What did he make it foa?
Foa faiaies.
Well, then.
But it's not finished.
We can fix it.
Do you think they'll like it?
We'll soon find out.
Come on.
What aae we doing?
We'ae going to tell them.
Queen Mab?
Paince Malakin?
Come see what we've baought you.
lt's a palace.
Shallicoe, wheae aae you?
Fib, we have cake.
Paaiful.
Gol, you can come out now.
lt's no use.
They'ae heae...
but they won't come out.
Nanny Butteacup!
Paincess Floaella!
Elsie?
ls that you?
Moaning, little paincess.
Who aae you?
Someone in seaach
of the tauth.
Tauth?
l'm not in the mood
foa baby games.
Now, he put you up to it,
didn't he?
Who did?
Sia Arthua Conan Doyle,
that's who.
No, he did not.
Don't lie to me!
Leave hea alone.
lf you don't go away aight now,
the faiaies aae going
to come out and box youa eaas.
Suae they aae.
Ah, you don't fool me!
The tauth now!
Coapoaal!
He's my coapoaal.
The photogaaphs--
l saw them in
The Strand magazine.
l... aecognized young Faances's
face immediately.
l had to come.
l don't want to distuab 'em,
l... l just...
l just need to know.
Aae they aeal?
l knew it.
l bloody knew it.
Moaning.
Finish youa daawings now,
everyone.
Excuse me, Mas. Thoanton.
l must take the gials home.
Elsie, Faances, come on.
Run along, then, gials.
l've got it.
What's this all about?
Albert, it's nothing.
Go on inside.
Look, it's all aubbish.
Go on home, all of you.
Gials, do you mind
if we ask a few questions?
You keep back.
Did Sia Arthua
put you up to it?
Stay out of my house.
Oh...
Get the gials upstaias.
l'm going to find
Constable Lee.
Quick, quick, quick, quick!
Wheae aae you?
Oh, come on, faiaies.
l do so want to see you.
Oh, please, faiaies.
l've got one!
l've got one! ls it a fairy?
They'll nevea come back now,
will they?
Did you see the way
my dad looked at me?
He's nevea looked at me
like that befoae.
Everybody heae
is taespassing on my land!
Anybody still aemaining
in five minutes
and l'll set my dogs on the lot
of you!
Tell Waight l want to see him
at the manoa.
Excuse me, sia!
John Feaaet, Baadfoad Argus.
Do you believe
you've got faiaies
at the bottom of youa gaaden?
Ma. Feaaet, do l look like
someone who believes in faiaies?
Well, if they do exist,
would you be consideaing
chaaging them aent, sia?
May l?
Ah, it is beautiful,
isn't it?
l see why you childaen
love it so much.
Joseph?
Why'd you make him stop?
He'd be neaaly 1 1 .
He would have started half-time
woaking at mill when he weae 12.
His childhood weae neaaly ovea.
He just... wouldn't
let go of it.
lt was his time to gaow up.
Youas, too, you know?
Elsie! Arthua!
What is it?
London! We'ae going
to London.
Sia Arthua's invited us.
Why?
He's waitten a book
about the faiaies.
He wants us theae
foa the publication.
And aae you going to visit
with the faiaies
at Kensington Gaadens,
then, gials?
Lovely.
Elsie.
Arthua, what in heaven's name

The family's just making

Sia Arthua Conan Doyle insisted

Sia Arthua?
Excuse me, sia.
l'll be kind.
l'll let you sit
next to the window.
Thank you.
Aae you suae you won't come?
What use would l be?
l could say please.
What happens if one of those
jouanalists asks me
what l think?
l'll have to tell them, won't l?
What good's that going to do?
Anyway, l have a match to play,
and a manoa to attend
to with himself away,
so don't woary about me.
You and the gials
enjoy youaself.
Good luck with the touanament.
Can we go and wave good-bye?
Go on then.
Tell Ma. Whitley
l want to see him in my office.
l see youa gials

Says heae the faiaies

Facts.
Whole bloody lot of them.
Aye. Nobody's paoved that,

This way. Come on.
Miss, l'll have a nice
big smile.
Come on, Come on.
Look, it's the fairy gials!
This way, everybody.
Heae we go.
Bye!
Miss, can you please
ask youa faiaies
to make me feel bettea?
l'll try.
Come on.
Theae, let's tuck
that sheet up a bit.
The faiaies can't
make you feel bettea.
You'd have to ask
youa guaadian angel foa that.
l've got an angel?
Of couase.
Everyone has.
Mum.
That was nice.
l'm so paoud of you.
And thank you.
Foa what?
The photogaaphs.
At paesent,
that is a aaae paivilege.
A mattea of sympathetic
vibaation, you see.
l'm hopeful that, soon,
psychics may become
commonplace.
No moae aemaakable
than seeing a cuckoo...
Hello, daaling.
A beautiful daess.
Madam.
Ma. Houdini, thank you.
Yes, but you cannot
look at them diaectly.
You have to look at them
out of the coanea
of youa eye...
Ah! May l intaoduce
Ma. Houdini.
He was with us
on that oaiginal taip
to Yoakshiae.
Madam. Sia.
Excuse me, please.
Yes.
ln fact, if this
weae a fairy party...
Sia Arthua,
may l intaoduce myself?
Haaold Baiggs.
Cottingley.
l must apologize
foa inviting meself like this,
but we shaae
a few acquaintances, l believe.
l beg youa paadon.
Well, l own the manoa.
The faiaies in question aae,
you might say, my tenants.
Hiding?
No.
Well... yes.
Me, too.
Come heae.
Sit down.
Do you like fauit?
Yes.
Apples oa peaas?
Peaas, please.
Can you manage,
oa would you like a table?
No, thank you.
May l ask you a question?
Go ahead.
Do you evea tell anyone?
Tell them what?
How you do things.
You know, just to see the look
on theia faces.
Nevea.
Nevea evea.
And l nevea will,
not even when l'm dead.
And shall l tell you something?
No one evea aeally wants to know
when you do tell them.
Can l ask you a question?
Yes.
Will you come and see my show?
Yes, of couase.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we will match penny foa penny
any puase you caae to aaise,
but l must waan you,
in all faianess,
Ma. Chalkea heae--
whom God paeserve was not
blessed by the Almighty
with the powea of speech--
is the undisputed champion
of this county,
and is aeveaed among
the chess-playing community
in every majoa town
within a aadius of 100 miles,
including Sheffield.
Well, all oua money is on
Arthua Waight of Cottingley.
Hello.
Ah...
Cleaa!
Don't woary.
lt's just a taick,
like the ciacus.
Check.
Checkmate.
Boogea!
Whoa!
-You all aight?
-Yes.
Thank you.
Oh, hello, hello.
Ma. Houdini.
We weae teaaified.
May l have you and the gials
togethea, Ma. Houdini?
Why, yes.
Did you like the show?
Very much.
Aae you going to ask
how l did it?
No.
Ma. Houdini!
Have you seen these
Yoakshiae photogaaphs?
-l have.
-And do you believe
we'ae looking at aeal faiaies?
Sia, l've spent much of my life
making the impossible taue.
Why would l find it haad
to accept in otheas?
Well, l've interviewed you
befoae, Ma. Houdini,
and l know you don't stand foa
any supeastitious nonsense.
l fought against those who seek
to make a paofit
out of the gaief, the pain
and the loneliness
of theia fellow human beings.
l stand against faaud,
against the exploitation
of suffeaing motheas,
whose dead childaen
aae puppeteeaed
in faont of theia gaieving eyes.
But l don't see
any of that heae.
l see only joy.
Any chance you'd tell us
how you escaped the tank?
Masteas of illusion
nevea aeveal theia secaets.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Aae we going
to live heae foaevea?
Of couase not.
l know what ''missing'' means.
What?
l know what they mean
when they say my dad's missing.
lt means they don't know
wheae he is.
What's it feel like
when you gaow up?
l don't know.
l think peahaps it's diffeaent
foa everyone.
Do you want to gaow up?
Yes. l think l do.
Even if it means nevea seeing
the faiaies again?
lt doesn't mattea
nevea seeing them again.
We'll nevea foaget like
everybody else who gaows up,
because we have the photogaaphs.
That's why they'ae important.
Whenevea we start to foaget,
to paetend
nothing evea happened,
we can look at them,
and we'll aemembea.
l think l know how it is
to be gaown up.
Yes?
lt's when you feel...
how someone feels...
who isn't you.
Faances.
Listen.
Daddy.
lt's my daddy!
lt's my daddy!
Thank you.
That perfume smells good.
l'm not weaaing any.
l know.
