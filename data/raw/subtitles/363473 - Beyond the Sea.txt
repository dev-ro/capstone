25.000
Yeah, we're walkin'. Yep.
(Small group applauds and cheers)
- Nice to meet you, Mr Darin.
- Thank you very much.
Bobby, we've got an AP interview tomorrow...
- AP interview?
- It's only two minutes.
It's my night with my wife and kid,
for us to experience it.
It's only two minutes. That's all I'm asking.
It's my one night I don't have to do that.
It's my anniversary celebration.
You missed them in Florida. We can't avoid 'em.
MAN: Good luck, Bobby.
# Mack The Knife
- Bobby, have a good evening.
- Thank you.
Hey, Charlie.
{Y:i}And now, ladies and gentlemen,
{Y:i}tonight, celebrating his 10th
anniversary in show business,
{Y:i}the Coconut Grove is proud to present
the one, the only Bobby Darin!
(Cheering)
Thank you.
Three guesses.
Wrong.
# Oh, the shark, babe
# Has such teeth, dear
# And he shows them pearly white
# Just a jackknife - ah so metamuk -
# Wears MacHeath, babe
# And he keeps it out of sight
- Two, three and one...
# You know when that shark bites
# With his teeth, babe
# Scarlet billows start to spread
# Fancy gloves though
# Wears old MacHeath, babe
# So there's never... never a trace of red
Darlin', then we'll swing.
# On a sidewalk
# Ooh, Sunday morning, ah-ha
# Lies a body
# Just oozing life
# Eeh! Some... Eeh!
Someone's sneaking
# Round the corner
# Tell me, could that someone...
Stop! Stop! Richie, stop! Stop!
- Hold it!
(Band stops playing)
OK, I want to start over. I want to do it again.
- You're kidding me. That was perfect.
- I want to do it again.
- I can do it better.
- Know how long it takes to set this up?
I don't know how much more
my chops can take today, boss.
When you start playing it right,
we can all call it a day,
but when you play it sloppy
like you been doing,
then we're gonna do it again and again
until we get it right.
- Bobby, the guys are tired, that's all.
- How do you think I feel?
Call it.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm gonna let you leave in a minute...
Whoa! Please stay in your seats
until Mr Darin has left the set.
Thank you. Can we have the bell up, please?
(Bell rings)
Bobby, we can't keep doin' it
over and over and over.
If Bobby says he can get it better,
then he can get it better.
- What the hell's he snapping at everybody for?
- Just let him walk it off.
Mr Darin, do you want to start
from the very top?
Hey, Bobby, you know we've got
press on the set today,
can you give 'em a few minutes?
{Y:i}CREW: Ready to go in ten minutes.
And no-one is discarded.
- How you doin'?
- I don't know, Charlie.
Ah, you'll figure it out.
C'mon, let's go back upstairs.
Put those two pieces together.
I'll look at 'em after lunch.
Mr Darin? David said
I'd get a few minutes today.
- Do you mind if we do this now?
- He's busy.
Nobody's ever done something
quite like this, about their own life.
Sure, they have. It's a self-portrait on film.
Think you can be objective about your own life?
Listen, this guy was raised
to always tell the truth,
and that's what he's doing.
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- I'm his brother-in-law.
So you mess with him, you mess with me.
I'm not messing with anyone, sir.
But being honest,
isn't the real truth
he's too old to play this part?
He was born to play the part
and you damn well know it.
{Y:i}Get outta here!
- Thanks, Charlie.
- That's just crap!
How can you be too old to play yourself?
C'mon! Let's get started.
OK, everybody... I want to change the opening.
- What?
- Why, Bobby?
We can't start with Mack,
we blow our wad too soon.
Opening with Mack is brave.
It says, "You want me? Fuck you! Here I am."
No. It's wrong.
- Let's just do Hello Young Lovers.
- Bobby, start when you got sick.
Nina, it's his story. Let him work it out.
{Y:i}No, no, no. I know what's important here.
Everything starts when he got sick.
- Uh-uh...
- Nina, please. Don't.
No, I think we should start when
they booed me off the stage.
{Y:i}Nobody's gonna come see
you get booed off the stage.
Stick with the hits. That's what sells.
How do you know
what people will come to see, Boom-Boom?
{Y:i}- When did you become the big expert?
- You tell him, Bobby.
{Y:i}As long as I've known you,
as far as you're concerned, I am the expert.
{Y:i}BO Y: Bullshit!
- Who was that?
- That's the kid playing him as a kid.
{Y:i}- Get down from there, kid.
CREW: I'll sort this out.
{Y:i}- We're not ready for you yet.
- Take five.
- Wait. I wanna hear what he has to say.
- Jesus Christ!
What did you just say, kid?
I said that's bullshit.
- What's bullshit?
- That you know him better than anybody.
Great. A miniature version of you,
and he's a method actor.
{Y:i}I need a drink.
- He looks just like him.
- I know, it looks like him.
- I'll be back.
DAVID: Here we go again.
So, you're playing me.
- I am you.
- You think you got me down?
I know you better than they do.
We could do it 100 times,
it'd never be good enough.
It's OK if he yells at me,
but not at the other guys.
They've been working their asses off, man.
I've never worked
with such an arrogant asshole.
Listen, you prick.
There are four people here who can't be fired.
You're not one of 'em.
He might be an asshole... but he's our asshole!
Look, he finally found himself.
{Y:i}So how do you think we should start?
You want some truth? I'll give you some truth.
(Children playing)
{Y:i}BOBB Y: The kid is right.
{Y:i}This is how to begin -
{Y:i}on the street where I grew up,
{Y:i}with my sister Nina, my brother-in-law Charlie,
{Y:i}and, to me, the greatest
in the world - my mother Polly.
Mrs Cassotto, I'm sorry to have to tell you.
{Y:i}BOBB Y: Ow.
- The boy has rheumatic fever.
CHARLIE: What is it?
- It's a strep infection.
But why is it so painful?
{Y:i}DOCTOR: Rheumatic fever damages the heart.
It affects the joints and the muscles, too.
So, what do we do, Doctor?
How do I make him feel better?
{Y:i}Just make him as comfortable as possible.
{Y:i}POLLY: Just tell us the truth.
You can never go wrong with the truth.
Even with the best medical care in the world,
{Y:i}the boy will be lucky to see his 15th birthday.
(Bobby coughs)
{Y:i}CHARLIE: Come and sit down, Doctor.
POLLY: What are you doing? Come on, Bobby.
Silly man doesn't know what he's talking about.
{Y:i}Come on, let's get you back into bed.
Mama, tell me about my father.
You know all about your father.
You just rest now.
But I like to hear you tell it.
Well...
Sam Cassotto was an important man.
He was a cabinet maker,
but then he started working for another man.
- Who was a gangster?
- Walden Robert Cassotto!
He was a businessman.
I thought you said you could
never go wrong with the truth.
All right, he was a gangster.
But he never did anything for this family.
But your father, Sam Cassotto,
he was a loyal and good man.
{Y:i}And he would've been so proud of you.
Keep the noise down, all right?
I want it to be a surprise.
Don't wake the kid, see?
(Car horn toots)
- Hey!
You wake my kid, I'm gonna
stick that horn up your fat ass.
You hear?
(Piano music)
# Up a lazy river by the old mill run
# Lazy lazy river in the noonday sun
# Linger awhile in the shade of a tree
# Throw away your troubles,
dream a dream of me...
Y'know, before your sister was born,
this is what your mama did for a living.
{Y:i}Music opened a whole new world to me.
{Y:i}No matter how bad I feel,
no matter how sad or sick I am,
{Y:i}I just touch these keys and "Poof!"
Like magic, I always seem to feel better.
I've always known you had talent, Bobby.
This piano is for you. Charlie worked hard for it.
See, God wouldn't have made you
suffer so much
if he weren't gonna make up for it later.
# I'm happy you can be
# Up a lazy river with me
(Bobby plays a high C)
{Y:i}Mama was right about music.
{Y:i}It opened a whole new world to me,
outside of time and illness.
{Y:i}A world I could live in.
# Throw away your troubles,
baby, dream a dream with me
# Up a lazy river with me
{Y:i}I knew then if I could live to 10,
{Y:i}maybe I'd make it to 15, and then maybe 20.
{Y:i}From then on, music was the most
important thing in my life.
{Y:i}Mama taught me all the moves
and dances from vaudeville
{Y:i}that made the greats stand out.
{Y:i}I would spend most days in bed with fever
{Y:i}but when I had the strength,
Mama and I would practise,
{Y:i}and practise, and practise,
{Y:i}until we created what she called "The Plan".
# Up A Lazy River instrumental
(Unaccomplished tooting)
{Y:i}Soon I would be old enough
to head to New York,
{Y:i}but Mama had one more lesson to teach.
From the halfway mark!
To be a star, a big star,
{Y:i}you've got to be talented, obviously.
But you got to be tenacious, have charisma.
But most importantly, you gotta have... it!
The great intangible.
{Y:i}And you've got it all, Bobby.
You're gonna be bigger than Sinatra.
I'd settle for a little Jolson. Mama, Mama, Mama.
# There are blue skies up above
# For as long as we're in love
# We'll be up a lazy river
# Up a crazy, lazy river
# Up a lazy river
# I go in your way
# Get out of my way
# Up a lazy river with me
(Cheering and farewells)
{Y:i}So part of Mama's plan...
{Y:i}YOUNG BOBB Y: Wait a minute.
- What?
You didn't go dancing down the street like that.
I know. It's a fantasy sequence.
- But it's not real.
- Forget real.
Listen, kid. Memories are like moonbeams.
We do with them what we want.
Oh. OK, then.
Go on. I'll be around when you need me.
Mama's plan was to surround myself
with the best.
{Y:i}So I now had a manager
who had never managed -
{Y:i}Steve Boom-Boom Blauner,
{Y:i}a public relations guy who had never related
to the public - David Gershenson,
{Y:i}Behrke, who had only
conducted the high school band,
{Y:i}and my brother-in-law Charlie,
a garbage man, as my valet.
Not in the school band now, huh, Bobby?
Let me tell you, when you come from nothing,
like us - like him -
{Y:i}then you're destined to make a name
for yourself.
And we will, Richie, we will.
Drive over there.
Drive over to those friggin' girls. Go on.
Go on! Hey, girls,
do you wanna see a real star?
{Y:i}While Sinatra was playing at the Copa,
{Y:i}Walden Robert Cassotto would play
any place they would book him -
{Y:i}barmitzvahs, weddings,
and a few dives on Long Island.
# Jump Down, Spin Around
# I saw a skeeter on my head
# Slipped and fell and killed him dead...
- Hey, kid, you ain't no Sinatra.
- Stop. Stop.
They're lazy. They don't like to rehearse.
They don't get better. They're wasting my time.
- It's only the Safari Club.
- I don't care!
We know three songs, they can't
keep pace with two of them.
Bobby, you didn't know what F sharp
was, now you're an expert?
Bobby, you called the Safari Club a disease.
- You guys sounded great.
- No, we sounded like shit.
The audience deserves better.
{Y:i}I had a hot head, a weak heart
and an even worse stage name.
{Y:i}Walden Robert Cassotto isn't a name
you could see on a marquee.
{Y:i}Well, maybe for one night only.
{Y:i}One thing most performers were doing back
then was to find a great stage name.
{Y:i}And then one day, I saw it.
{Y:i}The perfect name.
{Y:i}Just blinking. Darin.
{Y:i}(Electrics fizz)
- Darin. Bobby Darin.
{Y:i}And no sooner did I change my name
that I got my first gig on television.
# The Rock Island Line, it's a mighty good road
# Rock Island Line is the road to ride
# Rock Island Line...
{Y:i}Unfortunately, I didn't know the lyrics
to the song,
{Y:i}so I had to devise my own method
to get through it on live television.
# Ooh-ee
# Well, it's ABC WXYZ
# Cat's in the corner and he don't see me
# On the Rock Island Line, it's a mighty fine road
# Rock Island Line is the road to ride
# Rock Island Line, it's a mighty fine road
# And if you wanna ride it, gotta ride it...
{Y:i}Didn't win me many fans.
# On the Rock Island Line
{Y:i}But it didn't finish me either.
{Y:i}My record company was giving me
one last chance to make a hit.
Bobby, it's all about the image.
Are you starting again? It's my last session.
- You look like shit.
- I know my hair is falling out!
Next time you go on television, wear one.
- That looks so goddamn fake.
- John Wayne wears one.
Very authentic. Humphrey Bogart wears one.
- Bogart has an album coming out, does he?
- Sinatra wears one.
{Y:i}(As Jerry Lewis) All right, Boom-Boom, you win.
I'll go back to making the vinyl and the records,
and the putting the wax in the thing
and making it go.
Let's sing the song again, hello.
CHARLIE:
Does this song make any sense to you?
It takes place in a toilet. It shouldn't.
Maybe he should be in the shower.
- Guys don't take baths.
- I agree.
I put the tow... Wait, wait.
I wrap the towel around me,
{Y:i}and then I jump back in the bath.
How comes he jumps back in the tub?
- Doesn't he know these people?
- Where else should he go?
- We gotta play with it.
- Play, but just keep it to an hour.
That's all the time we got, Bobby.
Hey, tell me something.
Who's this guy, Yom Kippur,
they got booked on Friday?
# Splish splash, I was taking a bath
# Long about a Saturday night
(Screaming on TV)
- What are they screaming?
{Y:i}#...thinking everything was all right
{Y:i}# Well, I stepped out the tub,
I put my feet on the floor
{Y:i}# I wrapped the towel around me...
{Y:i}I finally topped the charts with a song
I wrote in 20 minutes.
{Y:i}Now, listen carefully to the lyrics.
They're very profound.
{Y:i}# Oh, there was a party going on
A splishin'and a splashin'
{Y:i}# Reelin' with the feelin'
- Look at that!
He said he'd do it, and he did it.
{Y:i}Charlie, I'm trying to hear him sing!
He's going to be the biggest
star in show business.
# Bing-bang, I saw the whole gang
# Dancing on my living room rug, yep
# Flip flop, they were doing the bop...
Ma, get away, I can't see.
What's that on his head?
{Y:i}# Miss Molly was even there too...
- What is it?
- It's a toupee. One of those.
(All laugh)
# I was a splishin' and a splashin'
# I was a rollin' and a strollin'
# Yeah, I was a movin' and a groovin'
{Y:i}I was a teen idol for about a minute and a half,
{Y:i}but Mama's plan was to be bigger than Sinatra.
{Y:i}I wanted to do the great standards,
{Y:i}but my producer thought
I was nuts to turn my back on rock'n'roll.
Teenagers aren't going to buy an album
of you doing standards.
Ahmet, how do you know
what teenagers will buy?
What, you got a crystal ball back there?
I know you don't change your image
when you're hot like this.
You know what? I don't want teenagers
to be my only audience, so that's perfect.
Why can't you be satisfied?
You just did Bandstand!
Bandstand's mostly for kids.
Ahmet, I want the Copa.
With rock'n'roll,
I'm like a thousand other guys out there.
I gotta prove I can sing. I want it all.
I want the major leagues.
I want nightclubs, Vegas, movies, TV.
This album will make it happen all fast.
You don't have to prove anything.
You're a star already.
- Is that what you think, Ahmet?
- Of course!
Hang on a second. Hey, kid! Hang on a second.
- Kid! Kid!
- I don't have time for this, Bobby.
- What's up?
- I've a question. Will you do me a favour?
- Will you look at me?
- What?
Just look at me.
Do you know me?
- What?
- Do you recognise me?
- What are you talking about?
- Do I look familiar to you?
No. You don't. I don't know you.
{Y:i}Leave me alone, crazy bastard.
I got things to do.
Thanks, pal.
Ahmet, when the delivery guy
knows me, then I'm a star.
# They found little Annie all covered with ice
# Still clutching her poor frozen shears
# Amidst all the blossoms
she had fashioned by hand
# And watered with all her young tears
# There must be a heaven
where little Annie can play
# In heavenly gardens and bowers
# And instead of a halo,
she'll wear round her head
# A garland of genuine flowers
# No more artificial flowers
# Throw away those artificial flowers
# Flowers for ladies of society to wear
# Throw away those artificial flowers
# Those dum-dum flowers
# Fashioned from Annie's...
# Fashioned from Annie's despair
- Give her the real thing.
- Yeah!
(Telephone ringing)
{Y:i}POLLY: Cypress, 2-6-7-2.
Bobby, you're to remember this number.
Any time, if you need me,
no matter where you go, you call.
Cypress 2-6-7-2.
{Y:i}You have to answer it.
You have to tell what happens next.
{Y:i}- Hey, Nina. How's it going?
- Honey, I gotta tell you something.
What?
# Up A Lazy River
(Melancholy jazz rendition)
(Church bell tolls)
(Drum Intro to Mack The Knife)
Go ahead.
You have to go.
Don't worry about me.
I can't.
You have to.
{Y:i}# Oh, the shark, babe
{Y:i}# Has such teeth, dear
{Y:i}# And he shows them
{Y:i}# Pearly white
{Y:i}# Just a jackknife
{Y:i}# Has old MacHeath, babe
{Y:i}# And he keeps it
{Y:i}# Out of sight
{Y:i}# You know when that shark bites
{Y:i}# With his teeth, babe...
(Whispers) Mama, I think this is
what we've been looking for.
(Television applause)
{Y:i}HOST: And here he is,
{Y:i}the greatest - Bobby Darin.
{Y:i}# So there's never... never a trace of red
# On a sidewalk
# Sunday morning, uh-huh
# Lies a body
# Just oozing life - eeh!
# And someone's sneaking round the corner...
{Y:i}Best New Artist. Best Album. Bobby Darin.
# There's a tugboat, huh-huh
# Down by the river, don't you know
# With cement bags just hanging on down
# Oh, that cement is there
# Strictly for the weight, dear
# Five'll get you ten...
{Y:i}Bobby Darin, this is your life.
{Y:i}# Did you hear about Louie Miller?
{Y:i}# He done disappeared, dear
{Y:i}# After drawing out -
feels good -
#... all his hard-earned cash
# And now MacHeath spends just like a sailor
# Could it be our boy's done something rash?
# Come on, come on!
# Now, Jenny Diver ho-ho-ho
{Y:i}# Sukey Tawdry
{Y:i}# Ooh, Miss Lotte Lenya
# Good evening, Lucy Brown
# Oh, the line forms way on the right, babe
# Now that Mackie's back in old LA town
# Oh, Sukey, you gotta look out, Sukey Tawdrey
# Stay back, Lotte Lenya
# Move it over, Lucy Brown
# Oh, the line forms way on the right, babe
# Now that Mackie's...
# Back in town
# Look out, old Mackie is back
(Cheering)
Let's go make movies!
# La mer
# Qu'on voit danser...
{Y:i}So with success, Hollywood came knocking.
{Y:i}I flew to Italy with Charlie and Nina
{Y:i}to make a movie with Rock Hudson
and Sandra Dee.
What is wrong with you, you stupid wop?
There's things in there that break!
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
- Nina, just cool it.
No, I'll do it myself.
BOBB Y: Look who's on the cover
of Screen magazine, Charlie.
- No, just...
- Nina, we're gonna take a walk.
CHARLIE: This is a movie.
- You bet.
- Can you act?
Charlie, I've been acting my whole life.
One, two, three.
- Ah.
- What did you wish for?
It's not good luck to tell.
I hope you get what you want.
Oh, that sure is sweet of you.
Cut! Great.
- OK with that?
(Bell rings)
That's lunch.
We'll move on after lunch.
- Hey, Sandy?
- Hm?
What do you say
you and me have dinner tonight?
No, thank you. I'll have dinner
in my room and then go to bed early.
Oh, my goodness, how can you stand
all that excitement?
I'm not here for excitement. I'm here to work.
- Maybe you should go to sleep early, too.
- How do you know I don't?
Sandra Dee, have you been spying on me?
I have never worked with somebody
so unprofessional in my life.
- Have you ever even acted before?
- Well, I'm learning.
But, blondie, you're not
exactly Audrey Hepburn.
{Y:i}OK, people, that's lunch. One hour.
Poo-Poo, how you doin', boy?
The name's Pom-Pom and she's a girl.
Sandy, don't let that little cupcake
ruin your make-up.
Mary, there's something I don't understand,
you'll have to explain it.
What?
How is it possible that you are Sandy's mother,
not her sister?
Oh! (Tuts) Mr Darin.
No. I'm serious. Look at the two of you -
side by side, you're mirror images of each other.
Honey, when you smile,
just make it a really soft smile.
Keep your lips a little... That's good.
{Y:i}There she is, Charlie, the girl I'm gonna marry.
I want you to find me a florist, a good one.
I want to send 18 yellow roses
to her hotel suite every day.
{Y:i}No cards. She'll know who they're from.
I'll give it a week, maybe less.
It won't take that long for Mary to cave.
Mary?
You're gonna send roses to the mother?
You always make sure the mama dog likes you
before you go near her puppy.
Mary ain't no Rin Tin Tin.
She's a tough broad with a star to protect.
{Y:i}You're gonna get yourself in a lot of trouble.
Charlie, this is trouble I can handle.
{Y:i}Your florist is gonna make more
out of this movie than you are.
I know you want to act convincingly
and everything,
but in the front of your mind, think, "What are
my lips doing now? Where are my teeth?"
{Y:i}Sandy and I just got off on the wrong foot.
{Y:i}If I could just get her away from her mother.
{Y:i}Just imagine, Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee.
We have a photo shoot in less than an hour.
I want you to wear the dress the studio sent over
from Paris. Don't forget the belt.
{Y:i}That's it. I'm gonna start
all over. Like we've never met.
{Y:i}Only this time I'll romance her
the best way I know.
Hello, Sandra Dee, I'm Bobby Darin.
- I believe we're making a movie together.
- Hello.
# Beyond The Sea
# Somewhere beyond the sea
# Somewhere waiting for me
# My lover stands on golden sands
# And watches the ships that go sailing
# Somewhere beyond the sea
# She's there watching for me
# If I could fly like birds on high
# Then straight to her arms I'd go sailing
# It is far beyond the stars
# It is near beyond the moon
# And I know beyond a doubt
# My heart will lead me there soon
# We'll meet beyond the shore
# We'll kiss just as before
# Happy we'll be beyond the sea
# And never again I'll go sailing
# And I know beyond a doubt
{Y:i}# My heart will lead me there soon
# We'll meet,
I know we'll meet beyond the shore
{Y:i}# We're gonna kissjust as before
# And happy we'll be beyond the sea
# And never again, I'll go sailing...
Sandy, we have to go now.
I have an interview.
Tell 'em you met Bobby Darin
and he's gonna marry you.
Come on, Pom-Pom. Nice hat, Mr Darin.
- I think she likes me, Charlie.
- The mother?
- That's a different story.
- She's just doing her job.
What job is that?
Steering her daughter clear of guys like you!
Yeah, well, guess what, Charlie?
Mama's job just got a whole lot tougher.
(Laughs) Yeah. That's my boy.
# So long sailing
# Bye-bye, sailing
{Y:i}So, Mr Darin, I've read that you
think very highly of yourself.
Well, Miss Duvan, I'm a man
who was raised to believe
that you should have a plan in life.
So once I've set my mind to
achieving something, that's it.
Would you excuse me for a second?
She has a slight cold.
You know, Miss Duvan... Mary...
I just think your daughter's absolutely terrific.
I just think she's the most wonderful thing
on earth.
But she's still only a child.
What you need is an older woman.
I just wanna be friendly with her.
We're doing a movie together,
she acts like she don't even like me.
Give her time.
She's not very comfortable around strangers.
Mary, I got an idea.
Why don't you let me take her out?
- On a date?
- No, no, for publicity. One time.
{Y:i}I'd never let her do anything like that.
Mary, think about what it would mean
for the movie.
- One time?
- One time.
Well, maybe we can do something.
For publicity.
I swear undying fealty to thee,
Sandra Dee, Queen o' the Hop.
And I pronounce thee, Sir Splish Splash.
- Arise, Sir Splish Splash.
- How was that, guys?
- Whoa!
- What about Rock Hudson?
- Rock Hudson's great. Isn't he great?
- He's great.
- I say we ditch these clowns.
- What?
- As soon as I say "run", run.
- You like it here?
{Y:i}- Terrific.
- You plan on more films together?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
Run. Run!
Hey!
(Sandra giggles)
Are you OK?
I can't believe I just did that.
God, you're beautiful.
Come on.
# Dream Lover
# Every night I hope and pray
# A dream lover will come my way
# A girl to hold in my arms
# And know the magic of her charms
# Because I want a girl
# To call my own
# I want a dream lover
# So I don't have to dream alone...
You OK? You look kind of pale.
Oh, no, I'm OK. I just kind of run out
of gas sometimes, that's all.
It really makes you think,
being in a place this old.
I mean, people have been
living here and loving here,
struggling, dying, for thousands of years.
And now you and I are here.
So, what kind of things do you like?
Well, I can think of one right now.
- Really.
- Oh, OK.
Erm... let me think.
A great melody.
Seeing somebody do something better
than anybody else in the whole world.
Ice cream. A good book.
What about you? What kind of things
does Sandra Dee like?
Er... long walks on the beach.
Crossword puzzles.
Empty studios.
- Elvis.
- Hey.
(Giggles) Just making sure
you're paying attention.
I'm paying attention, trust me.
You know, I was right about you.
Right about what?
You're gonna be easy to love.
# Someday, I don't know how
# I hope that she'll hear my plea
# Some way, I don't know how
# She'll bring her love to me...
May I have this dance, Miss Sandra Dee?
I would be honoured, Bobby Darin.
# That's the only thing to do
# Till all my lover's dreams come true
# Because I want a girl
# To call my own
# I want a dream lover
# So I don't have to dream alone...
Oh, you son of a bitch!
I felt sorry for you and you betrayed me.
Mary, I think you're overreacting.
I said you could take her out sightseeing.
For publicity.
- I didn't say you could marry her!
- Mother!
We are only engaged.
You, come with me!
# Because I want a girl...
(Door slams)
Sit!
You... You don't even know how
to comb your hair without me.
You don't know how to dress without me,
walk, talk to people without me!
I'm the one who brought you into this world.
I created you.
You'd fall apart in 15 minutes without me.
Oh, Mother, please.
When the time is right and you're ready,
{Y:i}we will find a husband for you who is suitable...
What's going on?
No, I love him! I love him with all my heart.
- Oh, he's a loser.
- No, he's smart and he's funny.
I wish you'd concentrated more
on Rock Hudson.
Rock Hudson is a very nice man,
Mother, but I'm not in love with him.
He still would have been a better husband
for you than Bobby Darin!
Why can't you let me make
a decision on my own?
I don't even want to talk about this any further.
We're leaving.
Him or me?
Fine.
Give her to me. Give her to me!
Mary! Mary! Wait, wait, wait a minute!
Nina, stay out of it!
{Y:i}It's none of your business!
{Y:i}NINA: Mary! I wanna talk to you!
(Reporters clamour)
You gonna plan to have any kids?
Show us the ring!
- Have you set the date yet?
- Marriage is such a big step.
We'll wait before rushing into anything.
Right, honey?
Right. Absolutely.
We are definitely gonna wait, gentlemen.
Absolutely.
OK, there.
- Bobby.
- OK.
This... is your home.
No...
I don't mind having a few friends
around every now and then,
and when your mother comes around,
which she finally will,
why, she'll be welcome too.
But for the moment,
I think it should be exclusively us.
Mr and Mrs Bobby Darin at home.
Sandy?
Hey, where'd you go?
Did you go in here already?
Sandush, where are you?
(Sandra sobs)
Hey, baby.
Baby, this should be
the happiest night of your life.
All right. Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on.
I can't. I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.
- You can't what?
- I can't go through with this.
- Of course you can, baby.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
- You don't want to be married to me!
I'm staying married to you until death do us part.
How do you marry somebody
that you don't even know?
Who doesn't know who?
I don't know you or you me?
I don't know if I know you.
I know you don't know me.
{Y:i}- I know you, you're Mrs Bobby Darin.
- No!
It's never gonna work, Bobby.
Let's just get out of it now.
No way.
{Y:i}- I'll make you miserable.
- OK.
Do you not understand that?
I don't want to.
I don't want to. I can't help it.
(Sobs)
Oh, my God.
What?
I love you.
I really love you.
{Y:i}Wait a minute.
Wait, don't move. Don't move a muscle.
Oh, God, Bobby, no! Please!
No, honey, honey. It's OK.
I'm not gonna hurt you. It's... Just watch.
{Y:i}My mama used to tell me a story
when I was a kid.
That in the Middle Ages,
one of the knights in King Arthur's court,
he laid down his sword
between himself and Guinevere
{Y:i}and he promised that he would never
cross over to the other side of the bed.
Really?
I am laying down this sword between us.
That's my side of the bed, and that's yours.
{Y:i}And I will never cross over...
{Y:i}...ever.
{Y:i}I don't care if we don't touch
for a thousand nights.
{Y:i}Only you can cross over to my side.
Only you.
# Once Upon A Time
# How the breeze ruffled through her hair
# How we always laughed
as though tomorrow wasn't there
# We were young and didn't have a care
# Where did it go?
# Once upon a time
# The world was sweeter than we knew
# Everything was ours
# How happy we were then
# But somehow once upon a time
# Never comes again
{Y:i}(Bobby laughs) I can't believe it!
{Y:i}Gimme a break.
(Men laugh and chat)
You look like a dummy.
- (Laughter)
- That's not my fault.
If it's not your fault,
who's running the goddamn thing?
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, sweetie.
- Look who's on the cover.
- (Wolf whistle)
Oh, honey, that's great. Did you see this?
(Men laugh)
- "I want to be a legend."
{Y:i}DICK: I can't believe you said that.
{Y:i}BOBB Y: That's not exactly the way I said it.
- Next time get him the cover.
- Yeah, it's a great story.
{Y:i}It gets better. "Brash, cocky
and arrogant, Darin then says,
"I hope to surpass Sinatra
in everything he does."
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
one time only on our stage:
Brash, Cocky and Arrogant.
We ought to use that
next time we play somewhere.
Boom-Boom,
where are we gonna be in five years?
Who knows? The Russians
may own show business in five years.
That's bullshit. What about next
week, next month, next year?
I can tell you where we're gonna be next month.
Don't tell me Detroit.
{Y:i}You know everybody in show business
hates me because of the deals I get?
What do you think, guys,
is that the reason they hate him?
While we're on the subject of what's
next, I almost forgot to tell you.
We're gonna need a new comedian
to open for you at the Copa.
What did you just say?
Didn't I tell you? You're playing the Copa.
You're friggin' kidding me?
- I got the call this morning, big shot.
- No, no, no!
We're gonna play the Copa!
We got the Copa!
Boom-Boom, you gigantic genius! Mwah!
Goddamned lunatic.
Sandush, I'm playing... Sandy!
Sandy, I'm playing the Copa!
We're playing the Copa.
My dream has come true, I'm playing the Copa!
That's great, sweetie.
What's the Copa?
The Copacabana's the most important nightclub
in the whole world -
everybody famous has played here.
And one day, you're gonna play here, Bobby.
{Y:i}And you're gonna break
all his box office records.
You got that?
(Girls scream)
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby!
All right.
George Kirby is the funniest comic
working today.
I never said he wasn't funny.
I said he was a negro.
He's breaking house records.
If they're a big act, like Sammy Davis,
they can headline here,
{Y:i}but they never- and you know that -
they never open at the Copa.
Look, Mr Podell,
there's a first time for everything.
Why not let one of the great
comedians play here?
Because I say so. You understand? It's policy.
I understand but, frankly, to hell with policy.
This is 1960, not 1860.
I heard you had a mouth on you,
kid. Save it for singing.
Listen, Mr Podell,
I respect that this is your club, I truly do.
But if you don't let George Kirby open for me,
I can't be responsible for the consequences.
You threatening me? Hm?
I'm cautioning you, Mr Podell.
Have you never heard of a sit-in?
A sit what?
It's a very popular form of protest today.
It's where members of the black
and the white community...
actually, all communities,
come together to an establishment
{Y:i}that they feel is being unfair
to their brothers and sisters.
Then the media shows up,
they hold hands, and they... they sit.
Sometimes for days.
They sit?
{Y:i}Yeah, they sit and erm...
And they sing.
You know, songs like, what's the...?
Oh. We Shall Overcome.
Overcome?
Overcome what?
