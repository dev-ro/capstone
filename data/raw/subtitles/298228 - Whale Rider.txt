((Girl Narrating))
In the old days, the land felt a great emptiness.
It was waiting...
waiting to be filled up...
waiting for someone to love it...
waiting for a leader.
(( No Audiable Sounds ))
- (( Crying ))
- (( Shouting, Indistinct ))
And he came on the back
ofa whale...
a man to lead a new people.
Our ancestor, paikea.
But now we were waiting
for the firstborn of the new generation...
for the descendant
of the whale rider...
- (( Screams ))
- for the boy who would be chief.
(( Speaking, Indistinctly ))
(( Whispers ))
paikea.
paikea.
There was no gladness
when I was born.
My twin brother died
and took our mother with him.
(( Sobs ))
Rawiri.
Everyone was waiting
for the firstborn boy to lead us...
but he died...
and I didn't.
(( Chanting In Maori ))
(( Sobbing ))
Where is the boy?.
Son.
- What's done is done. Come home.
- (( Sobbing ))
Come home.
Start again.
You mean just pretend
it didn't happen.
- That's not what I'm saying.
- You didn't even look at her, Dad!
She died.
- Son--
- No, no, no!
No. No, all you want
is your boy.
- It's all right.
- That's all you want. Isn't it?.
- You can start again.
- Hey, I've got a child.
Her name's paikea.
- What?.
- You heard me.
No. Not that name.
- It's paikea.
- No!
porourangi--
porourangi.
porourangi!
Take her away.
(( Gurgles ))
((Man Chanting))
(( Fussing ))
(( Wailing ))
- I told you to take her away.
- (( Wailing Continues ))
No. You acknowledge
your granddaughter.
(( Wailing Stops ))
She likes you.
He'll have another child.
He just lost a child and a wife.
Isn't that enough?.
You give that boy some time.
You hear me?.
He'll be back
when he's ready.
(( Fusses ))
Stupid old paka.
You say the word,
and I'll get a divorce, bub.
Just say the word.
- What'd he say to her?.
- Same old story.
Not good enough
for him, is she?.
He start that early
with me?.
You're a man.
You can handle it.
(( Grandmother))
Here. Betterget used to it.
This one's gonna need someone
to look out for her.
Yeah. All right.
((paikea Narrating)) Mykoro wished
in his heart that I'd neverbeen born...
but he changed his mind.
(( Giggling ))
(( Koro Chattering, I ndistinct ))
- (( Chuckles ))
- Hey! You old paka!
Quick!
(( Woman )) They were quick.
Must have let them off early or something.
- You've been smoking.
- Says you.
Maori women have got
to stop smoking.
We've got to protect
our childbearing properties.
You coming
to the concert?.
- Might.
- Bet she's got her best gears
all laid out on the bed.
- My dad's coming.
- Nay?. Better get my flash dress out then.
How long's he staying this time?.
Five minutes?.
Longer than that.
That's good, 'cause I blinked
and missed him last time.
((Grandmother))
What time's the concert, bub?
7.:30, and don't be late.
Gee, she's bossy,
that one.
And you'd have to be smoking in a pretty funny
place to wreck your childbearing properties.
(( Chanting In Maori ))
If you ask me the name ofthis house,
I will tell you.
It is Whitireia.
And the carved figurehead at the top?.
It is paikea. It is paikea.
((ChantingEnds))
- ((paikea speaking In Maori))
- ((Footsteps Falling))
(( Chanting ))
- No good to you, you reckon?.
- Shh!
(( passes Gas ))
- (( passes Gas Loudly ))
- (( Laughing ))
((Laughter Continues ))
(( Chanting ))
(( Grunts, Chuckles ))
- What are they feeding you?.
- You look different.
- Hmm. You do too. Must be growing up.
- Am not.
- Sorry I was late.
- It doesn't matter. It was stink anyway.
oh.
(( Sighs ))
Gotta look my best foryour brother.
- Hey, bro.
- Rawiri?.
- Good to see you, man.
- (( Chuckles ))
- Yeah, put on a bit of weight
since I saw you last time.
- Yeah.
Hey, this is
my new lady.
- kia ora.
- kia ora.
How many of my sons
you need, girl?.
Give us a hand with the food.
Make yourself useful.
You too, pai.
Come on, mate.
Let these important guys have their talk, eh?.
Takeyour time.
They've been
waiting for you.
Been a while
this time, son.
Been away.
Didn'tyou get any of my postcards?.
Your mother put something on the fridge.
I don't know what it was. A bridge or something.
France, probably.
I've been spending
a bit of time in Germany too.
- Like you there, do they?.
- Some of them do.
- So, you've been busy, then?.
- Yeah. Yeah, it's been good.
You know, I got a gallery interested.
Had some good shows.
How about you?.
We've been all right.
It's good to see you, Dad.
((pai Narrating))
It was my father's waka...
but after I was born he didn't
want to carve it anymore.
He went away.
Everybody did.
- (( sizzling))
- (( scraping))
- Sorry, Mum.
- You've come a long way.
I think you can have a sleep in.
- Isn't he having any breakfast?.
- Septic tank's blocked down at the marae.
Can't somebody else do it?.
Eat your breakfast. You're too skinny.
Can't hardly see your bum in those pants.
Thanks, Ma.
Thanks, Ma.
Your timing's spooky, boy.
(( Children Chattering))
(( I mitating passing Gas,
Laughing ))
Nerd!
putt-putt-putt!
- Ah! What was that for?.
- For the concert last night.
You have more respect next time.
(( Blows Whistle ))
- That teacher ofyours got herself a husband yet?.
- Don't think so.
She still got those things on her teeth?.
paka, atschool we gotta do a speech
on where we come from and that.
So anyway, you know how
we all came on a whale?.
That's right.
But where does
the whale come from?.
- From Hawaiiki.
- Where's that?.
It's where we lived before we came here,
where the ancestors are.
- So, paikea came from there.
- Ae.
- How long ago?.
- Long time.
But how long?.
See that there?.
Look at it closely.
What do you see?.
- Lots oflittle bits of rope all twisted together.
- That's right.
(( Speaking In Maori ))
Weave together the threads of paikea
so that our line remains strong.
Each one of those threads
is one of your ancestors...
all joined together and strong...
all the way back
to that whale ofyours.
(( Sighs ))
Useless bloody rope.
I'll get another one.
paka! paka!
It's working!
It's working.
- ((Engine Dies ))
- I don't wantyou to do that again.
It's dangerous.
That's a good one.
Come in.
- A seat foryou over there.
- kia ora.
- Hi.
- Hi. kia ora.
Have you met pai's father?.
porourangi...
this is Miss parata
from the school.
- kia ora.
- kia ora.
- Thought she'd appreciate seeing the show.
- No problem.
This is some of my work
from my last exhibition in Germany.
Start again, from the beginning.
She wants to see all of it.
All right.
Yeah, like I was saying,
uh-- oh, sorry.
Who's that, bro?.
Anna. It's a woman
I've been seeing.
(( Clears Throat ))
Actually, she's pregnant.
We're expecting a child.
Why didn'tyou tell me?.
Congratulations, bro.
You always get the good-looking ones.
Where is she?.
Why don'tyou bring her?.
Uh, she lives in Germany, Mum. You know.
She wanted to have the child at home.
- But you'll bring her back here.
- Yeah, of course.
Well, um, bit of a visit
when Baby gets big.
Rawiri, take Miss parata back to town.
Come with me, pai.
When were you gonna tell me?.
The dayyou left?.
I've been trying to tell you
since I got here.
Look, Dad. It's not forever.
It's just it's Anna's first child, you know?.
Her work's there,
her family.
Family?.
Yeah, I can't expect her to move
to the other side ofthe world.
Don'tyou use that girl as an excuse.
You can't wait to get away. I see it in you.
You never stay, because it hurts you
to see what's happening to us.
Yeah, it does.
You still walk away from it.
Leave that waka of yours out there to rot.
I'm not here shoveling shit,
but, Dad, I'm doing my share.
Did you even see mywork?.
Did you-- Did you even look at it?.
You call it work.
It's not work. It's souvenirs.
Those young men you turn your back on--
They've got something to learn from you.
You've got something to offer.
Don't you turn away!
Yeah, you've got
the privileges...
but you forget you've
also got the obligations!
Look at me, Dad, for once in your life.
Go on.
Ah, you don't even
know who I am.
I know who you're meant to be,
who you were born to be.
oh, yeah, right.
But I failed ya, eh, Dad?.
Yeah, because why?.
I had a daughter?.
Well, I'm probably gonna have another daughter.
And you know what?.
I'm not gonna letyou treat
another child of mine like that.
Then take her with you! You don't like the job
I'm doing, take her! Go on! Take her!
-((Grandmother))stop it!
- She's no use to me.
pai?.
No, leave her.
I'll get her. pai!
You all right?
Gotta watch that Koro sometimes.
Big mouth of his gets away on him, eh?.
He didn't mean it...
about me.
Well...
you know, maybe
we should think about it.
Think about what?.
You coming to live with me
for a while.
What do ya think?
Why doesn't he want me?.
Oh, pai, it's not you.
It's not even about you, in a way.
Koro is just-- He's just looking for something
that doesn't exist anymore.
A new leader?.
They exist.
Yeah, they do,
except I think...
it's become
even more than that.
In his head, your Koro,
he needs a prophet.
What's that?.
(( Breathes Deeply ))
Well, somebodywho's gonna lead our people
outta the darkness...
and who'll make everything
all right again.
only problem is, you can't just decide who those
people are just because you want them to be, eh?.
Like my brother?.
Yeah.
Your Koro made himself believe so strongly
that he was gonna be the one.
But what if he was?.
And what if he wasn't?.
You know, your Koro,
he did the same thing with me.
Is that why he's
so hard on you?.
Yep. pretty much.
Because I can't be
what he wants, eh?.
Me neither.
You think about it, okay?.
You know you'd make me really happy
if you'd come and stay with me.
Mmm.
Just think about it.
- Ready, pai?.
- one more go.
You be good
to that girl.
That's right.
You look.
I'm gonna need
all the firstborn boys.
- It's time they learnt.
- Learnt what?.
When she was born,
that's when things went wrong for us.
That's where
we'll find the answer.
(( Vehicle Approaching))
- (( Sighs ))
-  ((Electronica ))
You all right?.
Stop the car.
pai?
What is it, pai?
Can we go home now?.
But why?. What is it?.
What's wrong?.
- I have to go home.
- Why?.
I just have to.
I know.
It's okay.
There are some discussions about the--
(( Indistinct ))
paka!
I'm back.
Not now, pai.
But I'm back.
I'm back.
Anyway...
where does
that information come from?
It comes from the books.
((Bell Ringing))
- You shouldn't be smoking.
- Tryin' to give up, aren't I?.
- How come you didn't go with your dad?.
- I did.
Hmm. For one day.
I would have gone.
When my dad gets out,
I'm gonna go with him.
- Where?.
- Wherever. Get outta this dump.
Koro's gonna be pissed off
when he sees you smoking.
No, he won't,
'cause he's not coming.
- Is so.
- No, he's getting the school ready.
What school?.
For us fellas, to teach us
the old ways and that.
probably gonna be stink.
((Engine starts ))
- You can come on the bus ifyou want.
- I'm waiting for Koro.
- But he's not coming.
- I said, "I'm waiting."
(( Vehicle Departs ))
- When you're ready.
- When everyone's here, I'll be ready.
They are here.
Those boys have waited half an hour.
You tell her you weren't
going to pick her up?.
She could have come
on the bus.
You pick her up every day for years
and she's just supposed to guess?.
(( Sighs ))
Good. Let's go.
Do the welcome, bub.
Go on.
What do you think you're doing?.
(( Singing In Maori ))
(( Singing In Maori ))
((koro))
pai.
You're a girl.
Go to the back.
What did I say?.
What did I say?.
Then leave.
Go on!
For you boys, this will be
a sacred school oflearning.
You'll be taught
in the old ways...
in all the qualities
of a chief.
You will be tested
for your strength...
your courage,
your intelligence...
and your leadership.
(( koro ))
paikea's canoe sank...
and he called on the ancient ones for strength.
You're going to learn that chant.
All of you. Learn it exactly.
And if you break the chant,
you wi I l suffer the utu...
the consequences.
Like what?.
Someone dying or something?.
Like your dick'll drop off.
So, hold onto your dicks.
Enough. Hold onto your dick.
Now, repeat after me.
-((koro Chanting In Maori))
- (( Chanting ))
(( Chanting, Whispered ))
((koro ))
The Taiaha is an instrument of war...
a tool for fighting.
If you want to master it,
you've got to show it respect.
Hemi. Here.
peh!
(( Cries out ))
pick it up.
Good.
Be angry.
Anger's part of your battle.
You gotta learn to control it.
Now, take a break.
Get a drink of water.
The rest of you in pairs.
- koro know you're doing that?
- I'm not doing anything.
How come you're hiding
around here then?.
Koro's cool, eh?.
He's teaching us to be warriors, man.
Gonna be chiefs.
We're gonna smack
all those other ones.
You shouldn't have hit
Koro like that.
He was all right.
He was real patient, eh?.
- How come he won't let you do it?.
- Girls aren't allowed.
You could sit up the back.
Long as you were quiet. I wouldn't mind.
You're not even
holding it right.
Your hands should be
like this.
And yourfeet...
Iike this.
Go back to the school, Hemi.
I said, "Go."
I'll deal
with you later.
I'm sorry, paka.
You gone deaf now?.
Somebody just
apologized to you.
You don't mess around
with sacred things!
she was
just watching!
She was using
a Taiaha.
Let the girl do it.
You might be
the boss out there...
but I'm the boss
in this kitchen.
I'll do it.
(( Sighs ))
You forgot
something.
Hey, it's not too bad
up here.
He's got a lot of rules
he has to live by.
- It's not fair.
- I know...
but sometimes you've just got to let him
think that he's the boss.
- He is the boss.
- Hmph. Not of me.
I let him think he is, though.
- What's wrong with me, Nanny?.
- Nothing's wrong with you. You hear me?.
You got the blood of Muriwai
in your veins, girl.
Think she'd be proud of you
saying things like that?.
Anyway, that old paka's not the only one
who knows some tricks.
Eh?.
Well, you wouldn't know it now,
but before he got fat and ugly...
your Uncle Rawiri was a bit
of a hot shot with the Taiaha.
- True?.
- Won a trophy and everything.
oh, you should have
seen him.
He was beautiful.
What happened?.
I don't know.
He was the second son.
But he knows some things,
your Uncle Rawiri.
Don't you worry
about that.
((Bottle Cap pops ))
- Is Uncle here?.
- out the back.
(( Mutters ))
Hi.
Damn, girl.
What did I tell you about sneaking up on us?.
I found this.
Didn't know
you played golf.
Not golf.
Taiaha.
Yeah, well,
this guy's playing golf.
They cut the end off
the golf stick...
swing it around,
and push it through there.
Hey, shut up!
I was good.
That's why
you're sitting here...
while your father tells a bunch
of snotty-nosed kids how to be chief.
((Rawiri))
poor little bastards, huh?
Could you teach me?.
- Hold up. This was a long time ago.
- So?.
please?.
- Does Koro know about this?.
- No.
- Well, let's get it on then, eh?.
- Yes!
You mean this?.
It's a broom,
isn't it?.
(( Crying out ))
- Yee-hee!
- Woo-hoo!
(( Giggles ))
Morning, Dad.
((Vehicle Approaching))
- Hey! There goes that little girl, pai!
- Move, girl! Move!
(( Shouting, Indistinct ))
(( Shouting Continues ))
- ((pai Crying Out))
- ((sticks Cracking))
Get him, pai!
Go, pai!
Get him, girl!
When you extend your tongue...
you're saying to your enemies...
"I'm gonna eat you.
"Your eyes will roll back.
Your head will be stuck
on the end of my stick."
Feel the ihi...
the power.
Make them feel the wehi, the fear.
I want the hairs on the backs
of their necks to stand up.
Take off your shirts.
((shouts In Maori))
When you
slap your chests...
I want you
to slap them hard.
Bleh! Bleh!
Scratch them.
Make them bleed.
Timata.
Bleh!
(( Grunting ))
Bleh!
Good, Hemi. Good.
It's not justyour fathers
that are watching you today.
All these ancestors
are watching too.
((Footsteps Approaching))
This is my dad.
Come to see
your boy?.
- Yeah.
- Good.
Hemi, you first.
(( Chanting In Maori ))
Hah!
Hah!
((Rap, Indistinct))
- Girl! Where's that school?.
- over there.
((Hemi Chanting Continues ))
Thought you were gonna stay
for the whole thing.
Seen your bit, didn't I?.
Come meet my mates.
- Hey.
- Hey.
This is my boy.
- Hey.
- Say hello.
- Hello.
Better watch out for this one.
Did all right in there, eh?.
See you later.
Tonight?.
Next couple of days, maybe.
((Engine starts ))
We're outta here.
(( Sniffles ))
Get lost, you.
Was that your dad?.
Get lost.
(( Grunting ))
- (( Chanting ))
- ((sticks Cracking))
What have you done?.
Answer me.
It wasn't her fault.
Go wash your face.
Answer me, pai.
- Do you know what you've done?
- No.
You have broken the tapu
of this school...
on this marae, the one place
where our old ways are upheld.
The knowledge that's been passed
down from your ancestors--
from my grandfather to me,
to those boys--
(( Shouts I n Maori ))
It's broken!
I'm sorry, paka.
You're not sorry.
Right from the beginning,
you knew this wasn't foryou...
but you keep coming back.
- Do you want me to fail?
- No.
You want these boys
to fail?.
What have you got
to say to them?.
I'm sorry.
- Say it again.
- I'm sorry.
Say it
till you mean it!
Say it!
I'm sorry.
- (( Crying Softly))
- ((DoorOpens ))
Want me to put
some more hot in?.
- No.
- ((WaterRuns ))
No.
You can get sick
sitting in a cold bath.
- What if he fails, Nanny?.
- Then he fails.
- What will happen to him?.
- Nothing will happen...
except me thinking about that divorce.
It's not Koro's fault, Nanny.
What's not his fault?.
Sounds like his fault to me.
Not that I'm a girl.
Not you, Hemi.
Rawiri.
You've all done verywell.
You've shown me
that you've got courage, that you're strong...
and that you can learn.
But there can only be one...
so there's one final test--
a test ofyour spirit.
(( Speaking In Maori ))
If you have
the tooth of a whale...
you must have the whale's jaw to wield it.
one of you will
bring that back to me.
Bubba's got a cold,
and I can't swim.
It's all right, man.
Hey.
- Give it to me.
- I almost had it.
Nanny?.
Come here.
It's not for long.
You can put your clothes in there.
And, uh, there's a lamp
if you wanna read.
Rawiri reckons you're
pretty brainy, eh?.
Anyway, it's just for
a little while.
((koro Chanting))
((pai Narrating)) He was calling
to the ancient ones, asking them to help him...
but they weren't listening.
- (( Chanting ))
- (( pai Narrating)) so I tried...
and they heard me.
 Uncle, is this where
paka lost his reiputa?
His what?.
That thing he wore around his neck.
He threw it overboard.
Crazy old paka.
- Where?.
-Just over there.
I'll get it.
((pai Narrating))
It's quiet down deep.
koro needed quiet.
That's what Nanny said.
He didn't want to talk anymore.
He just wanted to go
down and down.
(( Yawns ))
She's been gone
quite a while, eh?.
Nah, she's sweet.
(( Gasps ))
For paka's tea.
And I found this.
(( Laughs ))
- Got this for Dad's tea.
- Lovely. pop it in the sink.
pai got it.
She got this as well.
You gonna tell him?.
No. He's not ready yet.
Go on.
It's for my school concert.
You're my guest of honor.
So I'll see you there, paka.
(( Exhales ))
(( Chattering ))
put mine there.
Come on.
I want to get up in the front.
- Save this one for paka.
- He might be held up, bub.
No, he's coming.

Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.
Now to finish, we have
something very special.
one of our students has won,
not only our own school speech contest...
but the East Coast
Area Schools', as well.
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Miss paikea Apirana.
(( Applause ))
Did you know about this?.
She said she had
a surprise... for him.
(( Speaks In Maori ))
This speech is a token
of my deep love and respect...
for Koro Apirana,
my grandfather.
My name is paikea Apirana--
(( Sniffles ))
(( Sobs ))
Go on, bub.
(( Sniffles ))
And I come from a long line of chiefs,
stretching all the way back to Hawaiiki...
where our ancient ones are--
the ones that first heard
the land crying and sent a man.
His name was also paikea...
and I am his mo--
most recent descendant.
But I was not the leader
my grand father was expecting...
and by being born...
I broke the line back to the ancient ones.
It wasn't anybody's fault.
It just happened.
(( Whale Breathes Heavily))
(( Bellowing ))
Who is to blame?.
But we can learn. And if the knowledge is given
to everyone, we can have lots of leaders.
And soon,
everyone will be strong...
not just the ones
that've been chosen.
Because sometimes, even if you're the leader
and you need to be strong...
you can get tired.
Like our ancestor, paikea,
when he was lost at sea...
and he couldn't find the land,
and he probably wanted to die.
But he knew the ancient ones
were there for him...
so he called out to them
to lift him up and give him strength.
This is his chant. I dedicate it to my grandfather.
(( Sniffles ))
(( Chants In Maori ))
(( Chanting Continues ))
(( Sobs ))
(( Chanting Continues ))
((Cheering, Applause ))
((person Whistles ))
- She all right?.
- She's asleep.
That old man know
she's staying the night?.
If he doesn't like it,
he can sleep in the road.
Might be time for us to leave, eh, dear?.
What is it?.
You'd better come
have a look.
(( Whale Calls ))
Who is to blame?.
(( Whale Calling ))
((Whales Moaning,
Breathing Heavily))
(( pants, Groans ))
((pai Narrating))
I called them and they came...
but it wasn't right.
They were dying.
Hey, keep it away from the blowhole, bro.
That's it. J ust around the edges.
You okay?.
- (( Indistinct ))
- (( Whale Groans, Exhales ))
He died.
(( Cries ))
((pai Narrating))
koro knew what it meant.
It was paikea's whale,
sent to us because we were in trouble.
(( Chanting I n Maori ))
(( Chanting Continues ))
Dad?.
- We've got to turn it around.
- How?
Get a tractor down here
and some ropes.
We'll wait forthe tide.
If-- Ifwe can move it,
the others will follow.
- Get the men.
- They're stuffed.
Half of them have
been up all night.
They'll do it foryou.
((pai Narrating))
It was a test...
