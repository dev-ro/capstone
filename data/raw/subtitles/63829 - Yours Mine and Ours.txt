    (PLAYFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
       (CHILDREN SINGING)
          FRANK:  0900.
     In a few short hours,
     I was going into combat
     against my own children.
  Anyone who has a child
  knows what I'm talking about.
 That's the real war,
 our generation against theirs.
        Standing on that deck,
        surrounded by
        thousands of men,
 I suddenly felt
 smaller and lonelier
 than I'd ever felt in my life.
      I'd been through
      this same Golden Gate
      when Frances had died,
       and I'd come home
       on emergency leave.
     Now I was back for good.
    I'd left more than my heart
    in San Francisco,
    10 children, to be exact.
 As we sailed under
 that bridge, I didn't know
 I was passing under my future,
 because while I was going home
 to face my family,
   Helen was bringing hers
   to a new life in a new city.
       HELEN:  And don't think
       I wasn't frightened.
    I had become a Navy widow.
   I thought it was a good idea
   to get a fresh start
   where the surroundings
   wouldn't remind me of Dick.
    But four of my surroundings
    looked exactly like him.
     What troubled me
     more than anything else
     was the kids seemed
     more upset about leaving
     their friends in Seattle
         than by the loss
         of their father.
      It took me a long time
      to learn how little
      I knew about children
        especially my own.
   FRANK:  As the ship
    sailed into the bay,
    I took a good look around,
   because I knew I'd completed
   my last tour aboard her.
 My brother, Howard,
 and his wife had been
 taking care of my kids for me,
   but now it was Daddy's turn.
          So I started down
          the gangplank,
   blissfully certain
   I was doing the right thing,
       nobly sacrificing myself
       for my children,
 giving up my world for theirs.
        Pulling away forever
        from ships, and oceans,
        and homecomings
      to take up shore duty.
     Papa came marching home
   secure in the knowledge that
   they needed me desperately
      and would be overjoyed
      that I'd come back
      to take care of them.
   But they controlled
   their feelings beautifully.
    It was the sort of welcome
    that could make any father
        review his position
        on the entire question
        of birth control.
   Incredible as it may sound,
    I think they blame me
    for neglecting their mother
    all those years.
        But it seemed to me
        there was enough
        physical evidence
    that I hadn't
    neglected her completely.
    I suppose what they
    really couldn't understand
     was why I was allowing
     my brother and his wife
      to take Germaine and Joan
      away from the family.
    Here you go, baby. Come on,
    come with Uncle Howard.
            (LAUGHS)
    Oh, you couldn't take care
    of two little babies, Frank.
    Not yet.
      They'll be happier with us
      for a little while.
      I hope you can learn
      to manage the rest.
     You've hardly been home
     long enough
     to learn their names.
      I'm home now. I'll manage.
      Don't you worry.
  Goodbye, pumpkin. Bye, baby.
  Don't give them any trouble.
   If you live through this,
  the Navy's going
  to have to get
  a new kind of medal for you.
       -(CHUCKLES)
       -Good luck, Frank.
     Good luck.
     You're gonna need it.
        CHILDREN: Goodbye, Joan.
        Goodbye, Germaine.
        BOY: Goodbye.
     (CHILDREN CHATTERING)
         (DOOR CLOSES)
   Well, let's get
   something to eat. (SIGHS)
           They're not going
           to an orphanage,
               you know.
   They'll be half a mile away.
   You can see them any time.
    Susan, Louise, come on.
 It's only until I get things
 straightened out around here.
 And then what? You planning on
 auctioning off the rest of us?
  Where would I find a bidder?
  Come on, everybody,
  in the kitchen.
  Let's get dinner organized.
       Which one of us
       do you wanna cook?
        The war was on.
  FRANK:  I put an ad in the
   paper for a housekeeper that
   brought immediate results.
      The first one
      lasted an entire day.
        The second one
        lasted seven days.
   We discovered she was hiding
   from the police.
      After a week with us,
      she turned herself in.
    No wonder men go
    down to the sea in ships.
         I'd have gone back
         in a life raft.
     HELEN:  I had rented
      an ideal house
      close to the Navy base
      so I could work part time
      in the dispensary,
      close to the school,
      close to the playground
      and a little too close
       to the boy next door.
        I was broad-minded
        about it, though.
      I was gonna give that boy
      two more seconds
        before I went out there
        and broke it up.
      (CHILDREN SHOUTING)
   BOY 1: I hate ants.
   I hate ants. I hate ants!
     BOY 2: Oh, come on,
     this is really stupid.
   Listen, what are you doing?
   What are you...
   You hate ants. Never mind.
   Now, that belongs to her.
    What is the matter with you?
    You've been acting like this
    all week.
       Mother, how's a person
       supposed to hear?
   HELEN: Colleen, I'd like
    to know what's going on
   between you and that boy.
     And I don't care if he does
     look like Paul Newman.
      -Is the spanking over?
      -No, it is not over.
        Listen, what's gotten
        into you lately?
   Where is that good little boy
   that used to live here?
    I'll never be
    a good boy again.
    I'm never gonna be good.
       I don't wanna die.
  What are you talking about?
   Nicky told me that
   the good die young,
   and that's why Daddy died.
  You can hit me and
  you can hit me, but I'll never
  be a good boy again.
  FRANK:  Funny. The beginning
   of the school year had never
   been a problem to Frances.
       The girls just passed
       their dresses down
       from one to another,
          and it all sort of
          came out even.
 Have you ever been
 five years old
 and forced to appear in public
 in a dress that had
 three former owners,
 restyled by an old sail maker?
      Five years old
      and no future at all.
            (SIGHS)
    HELEN:  And then one day,
     Frank and I just happened
      to run into each other.
    FRANK:  I'd been wrapped up
     in my children for so long
       that getting this close
     to an attractive woman
     set my early warning radar
     pulsing frantically.
   HELEN:  I was glad
    to have a reason
    for a second look myself.
 Did you requisition
 those Fresnel lenses we need?
  I'll answer that tomorrow.
  The working day has ceased.
     Just starting for me.
     Drop me at the house.
     Frank, do you realize
     that at this very hour
    the Officers' Club
    is jam-packed
    with two-legged goodies?
    We owe it to our brethren
    at sea to do unto others
    as they would
    if they had our chance.
  Darrell, it may come as
  a shock to you, but there are
  other things besides girls.
          Yeah, women.
     Now, don't tell me
     it isn't on your mind.
 Any fella who has 10 children
 just doesn't quit cold turkey.
   And if you'd only just...
             -(TIRES SCREECH)
             -Hey!
     Why don't you
     watch where you're...
              -Oh, hello.
              -Hi.
        Well, old Sam the hermit
        gets out of the cave
        once in a while.
  She had my Cream of Wheat,
  and I had her Post Toasties.
     -What?
     -Saw her at the commissary,
     that's all.
 Frank, what's wrong with you?
     You gonna be an old maid
     the rest of your life?
        You really think
        that's what Frances
        would've wanted?
       Probably not,
       but give me time.
   Time? You're
   a borderline case already.
          You may only have
          a few more cruises
          left in you.
 -Come on in.
 I'll buy you a beer.
 -I thought you'd never ask me.
     You can stop
     worrying about me.
     Things are looking up.
   I finally found a housekeeper
   who seems to have
   staying power.
    Soon I'll ask you to loan me
    your little black book,
    but right now...
         Where you going,
         Mrs. Anderson?
  Mrs. Anderson was last week.
 I'm Mrs. Ferguson,
 and you can mail me my check.
    She left her broomstick.
    All right,
    what happened this time?
  -Who did what
  to Mrs. Ferguson?
  -(OVERLAPPING CONVERSATIONS)
       All right, one at a time.
       One at a time.
    -She and Louise had a fight.
    -A bad fight.
   Because Louise wouldn't
   come out of the bathroom.
          She was taking a bath
          for an hour.
         She went in,
         and they were yelling
         at each other.
  -FRANK: Is that strawberry jam
  on your hands?
  -Raspberry.
  I guess she started
  shaking her...
  Or she slipped on the soap.
 -Anyway, she fell.
 -She didn't fall. She fainted,
      right on the floor.
    Anyway, when Mrs. Ferguson
    came out, I was kind of mad,
    and I had to push her.
  (OVERLAPPING CONVERSATIONS)
 Wait a minute. Hold it!
 Louise fainted? Where is she?
  BOY: She's in her room crying.
  She won't come out
  and she won't let us in.
           We tried.
      I think she's dying.
             -And what have you
             been playing with?
                    -Ink.
        Hmm. Indelible.
            Louise.
 Louise,
 what in the world happened
 between you and Mrs. Ferguson?
 (SOBBING) I don't wanna
 talk about it. Leave me alone.
      Mary said you fainted.
      Is something wrong?
 No. I just wish I could
 get out of this house
 and drown myself, that's all.
     At least I'd be alone.
    Let me take you
    to the dispensary,
    have them check you out.
      No. I don't wanna see
      any doctors, and I don't
      want them to see me!
 -But, Louise...
 -No, please. I don't want to.
 No, stop it! I don't want to.
   No, put me down!
   I don't wanna go, please.
   Stop it, I don't want to.
         Mr. Beardsley?
        -How is she?
        -Oh, she's fine.
       Nothing to worry about.
       May I talk to you?
              -Privately.
              -Oh.
   I forgot my Post Toasties.
 We've scarcely met,
 but I feel that
 I must talk to you about this.
           Of course.
     Uh, your daughter tells me
     that you're a widower?
       Yes, that's right.
       I'm awfully sorry.
          Louise seems to feel
          the loss of her mother
          very deeply.
    On top of that,
    she's going through a very
    trying time emotionally.
       I don't quite understand.
       Am I being stupid?
           (CHUCKLES)
        No, you're being a man,
        which is sometimes
        the same thing.
  Oh, you can learn to do
  the shopping for the family
 and maybe even do the dishes,
       but that doesn't exactly
       make you a mother.
      Well, I'm not really
      cut out for the job.
       Well, it seems that
       it's not been easy
   for Louise
   to explain to you that...
            (SIGHS)
           You know,
 a tree can blossom
 in the middle of a busy city,
         but a young girl
         needs privacy,
      and she hasn't been able
      to find it at home.
    So if she's been emotional,
    or upset, or even
    a little bit hysterical,
   it's because she's growing up
   and suddenly changing.
    (SIGHS) Is that all?
    Why didn't she tell me?
      Because you would've said,
      "Is that all?"
           (CHUCKLES)
   She said that she's been
   very upset about having
   to share her room at home,
  and today,
  when the maid walked in
  while she was taking a bath,
       -she was so embarrassed
       that she...
       -Oh, poor Louise.
    Stopped being a little girl,
    and I never noticed.
         Well, if it's any help,
         I understand.
     I'm a widow,
     and I have the same problem
     in reverse.
 Now I'm sorry.
 Have you been alone very long?
            Forever.
       Almost a year now.
     I know what you mean.
    Dick was a navigator.
    He crashed,
    routine training flight.
      -Navy?
      -What else is there?
           -Mmm. Children?
           -Mmm-hmm.
 They say
 it's toughest on the kids,
 but they haven't convinced me.
            I know.
 And right now I think you have
   a rather difficult assignment
   with your daughter.
       I think you should go in
       and talk to her
       and take her home.
       Thank you, Mrs...
         North. Helen.
    Thank you, North Helen.
            (LAUGHS)
 -When are you on duty here?
 -Afternoons. Five days a week.
        Any of my kids get sick
        on the weekend,
          -I'll hold them over.
          -(CHUCKLES)
              Hi.
           -How do you feel?
           -I'm fine.
             -Can I go home now?
             -Sure.
          Turn around.

     -Hello.
     -Is this North Helen?
   -Uh, yes. Who is this?
   -This is Frank Beardsley.
         Oh, are you having
         more problems?
    No, no. I just called
    to thank you for helping me
    with my daughter today.
         Well, now,
         that's the worst reason
         I ever heard
          -for calling a woman
          at 11:00 at night.
          -(CHUCKLES)
        Well, I'm a little
        out of practice.
 (CHUCKLES) Well,
 as a matter of fact, so am I.
     Oh, for heaven's sake,
     ask her out to dinner.
          Who's that?
     Colleen, what are you doing
     on this phone?
     I have to make
     a very important call,
  and he gets off duty
  at the taco stand at 11:15.
       Colleen, hang up.
           -(SIGHS) I'm sorry.
           -Don't be.
      I could never have done it
      without her.
        How about dinner?
        Tomorrow night.
            Well...
      Mother, it's 11:14.
      What time would you
      like to pick me up?
      -About 1900?
      -Oh, aye, aye, sir.
      -Good night, Helen.
      -Good night, Frank.
      Good night, Colleen.
      COLLEEN: Oh, Mother,
      don't blink. You've got
      to let the glue dry.
 Oh, but I look ridiculous
 with all this goop on my eyes.
       -Mommy, you're beautiful.
       -You sure are.
  Thank you, but is it necessary
  that I wear these eyelashes?
         I got your father
         without them.
             -Mmm, but you were
             younger then.
             -Yeah.
         -Here. Here goes
         the other side.
         -Hold steady.
   Okay, let me take it now.
             -Mother.
             -What?
 Is he handsome?
 I mean, in an old sort of way.
            -Gee, I can hardly
            wait to meet him.
            -Me too.
    Oh, let's not overwhelm him
    with family.
    Not the first date, huh?
  -You mean
  he doesn't know about us?
  -Of course he does, darling.
           All of us?
      Oh, Mother,
      that's so romantic.
     -You lied to him.
     -I did not lie to him.
  I just didn't have the nerve
  to tell him the whole truth.
  Mmm, I understand.
  No man wants a liaison with
  a woman with eight children.
          -What's a liaison?
          -An affair.
         -That's what I thought.
         -Me too.
 I am not having an affair,
 and I'm not having a liaison.
  I'm merely going to dinner.
       As soon as I tell him
       about all of you,
 he'll bring me home
 in plenty of time for dessert.
     (STRUMMING ON GUITAR)
   Mike, see that
   it's lights out by 10:00.
  -10:00?
  -We're back in kindergarten?
  -They stay up later in prison.
  -Would you like to move?
      Mike, when you finish
      with the slot cars,
    will you spend 10 minutes
    with your geometry book?
      RUSTY: Flowers, Pop?
  Is that corny.
  How do you expect to make
  any time with that approach?
    We are just going to dinner.
    It isn't going
    to be a love-in.
   -You can say that again.
   -(CHUCKLES) No such luck.
  Did you tell the lady
  you have 10 little children,
      -two of them given away?
      -You bet he didn't.
   He'll hand her those flowers,
   then give her a snow job
         on how lonely it is
         here at home.
   (CHILDREN SIGH MOCKINGLY)
       You listen to me.
    Every time in the last year
    that I've dared
    take a woman to dinner,
       or been reckless enough
       to bring her home
       to meet you kids,
       you've done all you could
       to make her unwelcome
       and unhappy.
       Well, I've had it.
 I'm doing all I can for you,
  little as that is, I think
 I deserve some consideration.
     I suppose I'm being unfair.
     Who did this?
  My generation is the givers,
  your generation, the takers.
      Well, it's time to strike
      a blow for freedom.
        From now on,
        I intend to think
        of myself first.
      If this be treason,
      make the most of it.
  -But are you gonna tell her?
  -Yes, I'm going to tell her.
          (STRUMMING)
    Oh, you're gonna be
    a knockout tonight, Mom.
      -JEAN: Yeah, Mom,
      you're beautiful.
      -Thank you, darling.
 Good heavens,
 what did you do to this dress?
 Oh, Mother,
 it was practically an antique.
 We just shortened it a little.
 -A little?
 I look like a teenybopper.
 -Well, what's wrong with that?
        -I can't go out in this.
        -Why not?
     Your legs
     are better than mine.
      It'll be okay as soon as
      we shorten the slip.
      Give me those pins.
      Oh, heavens.
      Jean, run downstairs
       and tell Tommy to whistle
       the minute he sees
       Mr. Beardsley.
         -But I wanna watch.
         -Please, Jean.
     -The minute
     he sees Mr. Beardsley.
     -Will you stand still?
         You'll get this pin
         stuck in you.
      (SIGHS) Great,
      I'm put together
      with pins and glue.
       If there's a strong wind,
       I'm in trouble.

         -There he is.
         -(GIRLS GASP)
      -He's coming!
      -Hurry up. Hurry up.
  -NICKY: Look at him.
  -BOY: Wow, look at that car!
  -He's in the Navy.
  -NICKY: Look at that jacket.
   Look at those stripes.
   He's got flowers for Mom.
   GIRL: Yeah, blue eyes.
   NICKY: Boy,
   I bet you that guy's rich.
     (CHILDREN CHATTERING)
              -All right.
              -No!
           -Pass it on.
           -The door.
    Get away from the door.
 Get away from that door.
 Get away. Get back. Get back.
            -Oh! Hello there.
            -Hello.
     Well, we better hurry.
     I know how you like
     to get places on time.
   -I do?
   -Yeah. Where are we going?
  San Francisco. Little place...
  Oh, I brought you flowers.
    Oh, thank you.
    Why, they're beautiful.
     Shouldn't you put them
     in the house,
     give them some water?
      Oh, of course.
      I don't know
      what I was thinking.
      They're my favorite.
 Uh, beautiful night, isn't it?
  HELEN:  I had a wonderful time
  at dinner.
    I didn't know whether
    it was the food, or Frank,
 or the fact that I didn't have
 to do the dishes.
    FRANK:  I couldn't
     stop talking. I told her
     about Frances, the Navy,
        about the new
        carrier landing system
        I was working on.
    I told her about everything
    but the children.
  Funny how that never came up.
      I guess I figured
      it would be easier
      over an Irish coffee.
     -(MUSIC PLAYING)
     -(INDISTINCT TALKING)
     HELEN:  While Frank
     was getting the drinks,
     I was trying to figure out
     the most graceful way
     to break it to him.
     By the way,
     I have eight children.
 Speaking of eight children,
 (CHUCKLES) that's what I have.
  Have I mentioned
  that I have eight children?
     I have eight children.
        Well, don't look at me.
        I just got here.
       Excuse me, please.
     Pardon me. (CHUCKLES)
     Oh, that's all right.
      -That's why I come
      in this place.
      -What's your excuse?
     WOMAN: Pardon me, sir.
        (BOTH CHUCKLING)
       -Oh! Oh, I'm sorry, I...
       -That's all right.
             -That's why I come
             to this place.
             -What?
  That's a line I picked up
  on my way back from the bar.
      I don't know,
      you may have to drink this
      through your ear.
    Uh, Frank, there's something
    I wanna tell you.
             What?
             Uh...
     That was a wonderful dinner
     we had tonight.
   -I enjoyed all eight courses.
   -So did I.
        -Speaking of children...
        -We weren't speaking
        of children.
   -Oh, thank goodness.
   -Tonight, there are
   no children in the world.
     We're all alone
     on this desert island.
    Just you, and me,
    and a native
    who makes Irish coffee.
 (CHUCKLES) I'll drink to that.
          -FRANK: Helen.
          -Yes, Frank?
 There's something
 I've been meaning to tell you.
      -What?
      -No, I want you
      to look at me first.
        No, look at me.
  -Just a moment.
  -WOMAN: May I have a light?
 Not on your life, sweetheart.
          Ridiculous.
            -Something wrong?
            -Uh, no.
 No, no.
 What did you want to tell me?
     Well, this is the last time
     I'm going to bring up
     the subject,
       but you do like children,
       don't you?
     -Yeah. Yeah, within reason.
     -In that case,
     the hell with it.
       No. No, no, as long as
       you brought it up,
 there's something
 I've been meaning to tell you.
            -What?
            -Well...
             Oh...
          FRANK: What?
      -What's the matter?
      -I beg your pardon.
     -Something wrong?
     -Uh, yes. Yes, Frank,
    I have this terrible craving
    for a cigarette.
  I don't know what I'll do
  if I don't get a cigarette.
   I may have a nicotine fit.
       Could you get me a pack
       from the machine?
     What brand?
     King-size or regular?
     Filter or non-filter?
             -Yeah, wonderful.
             -What?
    -And hurry.
    -Well, here, hold this.
           HELEN: Oh!
     DARRELL: Hello, nurse.
         -HELEN: Darrell.
         -Well, Helen.
          -Hello, Darrell. Oh!
          -(CHUCKLING)
     -Your Irish coffee
     is winking at me.
     -Oh, Darrell, help me.
      Does this happen often
      or only during
      the molting season?
         Hurry, please.
    Now, don't you worry, honey.
    I'm very good at this.
      I've got an admiral
      with a loose toupee.
        Coming through.
           Pardon me.
           I'm sorry.
       Back for seconds?
    Darrell, what are you
    doing here? Chaperoning?
 No, I've been here
 since yesterday.
 Haven't been able to get out.
    You mean
    you haven't been trying.
  -Cigarette?
  -No, thanks. I don't smoke.
  -What did you do to your eye?
  -What did you do to my eye?
         Don't listen to him.
         It's perfect.
     Let's drink
     to the perfect couple.
       Two people who have
       so much in common.
  It's positively nauseating.
         To our nurse.
  You know, I just found out
  that she has a family of...
  -Oh, I'm so sorry.
  -(CHUCKLING) That's all right.
  I'm used to it.
    Over at Frank's,
    when they pass the soup,
    it's like Niagara Falls.
  He probably
  hasn't mentioned it,
  but he happens to have a...
 -Gosh, I'm sorry.
 -Sure is a rough sea tonight.
        Yeah, it's very
        crowded in here.
   Yeah, speaking of crowds,
  you know, you two kids
  really belong to each other.
     I just found out that
     she's the mother of...
       Squeezing through...
       Oh! Who pushed me?
     Here, let me help you.
   Hey, if you two wanna
   be alone, why don't you
   give a guy a little hint?
     Let's get out of here.
             Sorry.
      (INDISTINCT TALKING)
             Frank.
        What? How could you
        lose your slip?
   Shh! Don't ask questions.
   It's back there someplace.
     Do something about
     that floating eyelash.
 Oh, you are a tiger,
 aren't you? (GROWLS PLAYFULLY)
            (LAUGHS)
         (BELL RINGING)
  Frank, before we go
  any further, there's something
  I have to tell you.
  -Now what fell off?
  -No, no, nothing like that.
    I wish it were
    something that trivial.
 Frank, I have eight children.
    -Eight children!
    -Four boys, four girls.
        Different ages.
         (BELL RINGING)
     Frank. Frank,
     we're on a cable car.
   -Of course.
   -I get sick on cable cars.
       FRANK: Wait till you hear
       what I have to tell you.
       HELEN: What?
      FRANK: I have 10 children.
      HELEN: Ten?
           Ten? Ten!
    Three boys, five girls.
   -That's only eight.
   -Oh, and two on loan-out.
   Frank, eight and 10 is...
          Ridiculous.
     Helen, let's get off
       this damn thing.
     Now I'm feeling sick.
         (BELL RINGING)
       Frank, what do you mean,
       "two on loan-out"?
       Well, a man alone,
 I just haven't
 been able to keep
 a family that large together.
    My brother and sister-in-law
    have the two youngest.
        -Oh, that's awful.
        -That's what my kids
        keep telling me.
     They hate me for it,
     and I'm on their side.
   I wish you had known Dick.
    -What was he like?
    -Like you, in many ways.
 All wrapped up
 in the Navy and his children.
          And in you?
    Frank, I wanna thank you
    for a wonderful evening.
    It was nice knowing you.
    It was nice knowing you.
             -You know what?
             -What?
   -I'd like to
   buy you something.
   -Oh, that isn't necessary.
         Souvenir of our first
         and last date.
         -How about that Buddha?
         -Oh, no.
   That looks like real jade.
 -How about that little fan?
 -55 cents' worth of memories?
  HELEN:
  That's a pretty little lady.
      -You have excellent taste.
      -Thank you.
   This is a Chinese goddess
  who confers her magical powers
  on all who gaze upon her.
           -What is she called?
           -Kuan Yin.
  -What does that mean?
  -Joyous symbol of fertility.
    Wave him off.
    Bring him around again.
   3-4-Paddles. Wave it off
   and bring it around again.
      Why didn't you tell me
      she had eight kids?
     Why didn't I tell you?
      I got third-degree
      Irish coffee burns
      trying to tell you.
         But don't you worry
         about a thing.
   I've got a few
   less-crowded ladies
   who'll knock your hat off.
         Let's drop the subject.
         I've had it.
  You haven't,
  and that's what worries me.
         You've been in dry dock
         too long.
     Ask him to
     move the ball around.
        Come in low,
        check the red cell
        and come on in.
     3-4-Paddles,
     move the ball around.
      Check the red cell
      and bring it on in.
  It's no use.
  What girl is gonna want
  to spend a swinging evening
  -with a man who has
  10 children?
  -A girl who doesn't know it.
        -Want me to lie?
        -Of course not.
     -Don't bring the subject up
     until after.
     -Here he comes.
    3-4-Paddles. Nice pass.
      Now, I know a quiet little
      Japanese restaurant.
  I'll make the reservations.
        Madeleine Love.
         Now, there is a girl
         who is definitely
         not a talker.
  What sort of a girl is she?
         Does that answer
         your question?
    No, Darrell, and stop trying
    to arrange my life.
      Helen, I'm surprised
      you haven't met him.
          Make a fist.
              Ow!
  I haven't done anything yet.
       I was practicing.
        He's a wonderful doctor,
        the kind who scrubs
        for a date.
         Tremendous reputation.
         Nine handicap.
              -Now.
              -Ow!
         No more dates.
   Don't think of him as a date.
   Think of him as a meal.
      Now, I know a quiet little
      Japanese restaurant.
  I'll make the reservations.
         Don't rush me.
    What does he look like?
    I hate to use the word
     "Adonis," but there's
    no other way to say it.
      A touch of gray
      at the temples,
      very distinguished.
          Is he tall?
      He used to be
      a basketball player.
              Hmm.
    I had to lie, of course.
  But anybody who knew
  Frank and Helen
  knew they belonged together.
  All I had to do
  was let them stumble
  over each other a few times.
  You have to do that with
  the marrying kind of people.
 So I told her that Dr. Ashford
 was about 6'2", 6'3".
   A harmless little white lie.
 HELEN:  I wondered
  if the doctor would
  be so attentive if I told him
       I had three children
       taller than he was.
 FRANK:  Darrell's arrangement
  for my evening hadn't uttered
  a word since I picked her up.
       I had no idea
       what was on her mind
   until we drew up
   in front of the restaurant.
         There. I hate suspense,
         don't you?
   Now you know, and I know.
   Let's have a quick dinner.
    Keep the motor running.
    (SHAMISEN MUSIC PLAYING)
    Darrell said
    we had a lot in common.
              Oh?
      After all, you're a nurse,
      I'm a doctor.
              Oh.
     What's your specialty?
          Obstetrics.
   HELEN:  Darrell had
   a malicious sense of humor.
    I was upset that Frank had
    seen me with Dr. Ashford.
        I don't know why.
FRANK:  For some stupid reason,
 I had the feeling
 I was being unfaithful.
       And Madeleine had only
       taken off my shoes.
     HELEN:  The doctor's
      bedside manner
      was a little previous.
  I was embarrassed to think
  that Frank might be watching.
             He was.
   You're not worshipping me.
      Thank you. Mmm-hmm.
          Helen, I might as well
          be honest.
     I'm a very lonely man.
 There are times that I feel
 I could kick over the traces.
 -I'm not lonely at all.
 -Give up this race for money.
       I'm the mother
       of eight children.
      Travel to all
      the romantic places.
        -I have eight.
        -If I could find someone
        to go with me.
  -Doctor. Doctor.
  -I'd like to find places...
 I don't think
 you've been paying attention.
       I said I am the mother
       of eight children.
           (LAUGHING)
     I've always admired a woman
     with a sense of humor.
     FRANK:  Meanwhile,
      back at the ranch,
      it was round-up time.
 That's a very handsome family.
          -Very handsome.
          -Thank you.
  Excuse me a moment, please?
           Of course.
          Dr. Ashford?
            Sayonara.
        (TIRES SCREECH)
     Wasn't that your date?
          Yes, it was.
      He had an emergency.
  -Come on, I'll take you home.
  Hop in.
  -Oh, no, I wouldn't dream...
    -Oh, Madeleine doesn't mind,
    do you?
    -Are you kidding?
            -You see?
            -Well...
    She's my oldest girl.
    She's going with this boy
    who rides a motorcycle.
   Has hair practically
   down to his shoulders,
   and I think it's bleached.
  She never talks to me
  about him, never brings him in
  so I can meet him.
      -I hardly know what to do.
      -You can't tell her
      not to see him.
         -It's like shooting off
         the starting gun.
         -I know.
      You know, she's barely 16,
      and when he brings
      her home at night,
         they stay outside
         for about half an hour,
         kissing.
 Heavens to Betsy!
 What will they think of next?
   My Veronica, she's seven.
  She's so boy crazy, I'm afraid
  she's gonna get married
  before she's nine.
           (LAUGHING)
  (MADELEINE LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)
  She doesn't care about school.
  Only thing she can read
  are pictures.
      Yeah, yeah.
      Well, Tommy's almost nine.
      He can hardly read.
   But Jean, who's only seven,
   reads better than he does.
     I have that in spades.
 Louise is 12.
 She corrects Rusty's spelling.
  Well, Tommy can help Colleen
  and Janette with their math,
    -but he can't read.
    -I don't believe
    this whole conversation.
          Did you put something
          in my sugar?
       I have a strange feeling
       I'm taking a trip.
     -How many kids do you have?
     -Ten.
            (GASPS)
  Helen,
  there's no reason for us
  to avoid seeing each other.
      Well, I think we certainly
      could be friends.
  The fact I'm a man,
  and you're a woman doesn't
  have anything to do with it.
     And then the papa bear
     said to the mama bear,
          "Who's been sleeping
          in my bed?"
    Oh, come on,
    drop me off at the exit.
    Then you two can work
    yourselves up to a wild game
    of Post Office.
 No, I couldn't do that to you.
    Oh, please, Daddy,
    I'd prefer it. Ten kids?
      I'm nervous just
      sitting next to you.
             -Helen.
             -Yes?
      Why am I pretending?
   I want to see you again,
   and not just to be friends
        and not just to talk
        about children.
   -I want to see you again too.
   -Know something else?
  In spite of all
  the aggravation and
  the misery and the yelling,
 -I'm glad I have 10 children.
 -And I'm glad I have my eight.
   And I'm glad I'm careful.
        HELEN:  Between our work
        and the children,
   we somehow were able
   to steal a few hours alone.
    (ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)
          (INAUDIBLE)
   FRANK:  When every place
    we went was better
    because we were together,
      and I suddenly realized
      the emptiness was gone
    and the world just might
    be worth living in again,
        I knew it was time
        for the acid test.
    I invited Helen to my house
    to meet my mafia.
       VERONICA: Here she comes!
       Here she comes!
 GREG: What does she look like?
  Mean.
  You can see it in her eyes.
     Frank, I'm frightened.
       Now, don't worry.
   I had a long talk
   with the children.
   They're going to love you.
      Who locked the door?
          Sorry, Dad.
    I'll talk to you later.
      Well, group,
      this is Mrs. North.
       -Helen.
       -You know Louise.
        -Oh, yes. Hello, Louise.
        -Hi.
             -And Mike.
             -Mike.
        -And Rusty and Rosemary.
        -Hello.
         -Susan.
         -Hello, Susan.
       -Veronica.
       -Hello, Veronica.
             -And Greg.
             -Greg.
     You've met the family,
     -why don't we have a drink?
     -Frank.
      -Yeah?
      -This is only seven.
      Mary. Where's Mary?
         She's hiding.
     FRANK: Mary, come on,
     let's not play games.
  Hello, Mary. I'm Aunt Helen.
  You are not!
  I don't want another mother!
  I don't want another mother!
      Frank, I think I'm ready
      for that drink now.
    Mike, you think
    you can handle the bar?
          What would you like,
          Aunt Helen?
          Uh, I'd like a light
          screwdriver, please.
               Very light.
     That's orange juice
     with a shot of vodka.
  -I know, Dad.
  -I'm sorry.
  I'll have Scotch and water.
          I know, Dad.
 I keep forgetting Mike is 18.
      Frank, do you really think
      it was a good idea,
      my coming here?
       Of course. If you hadn't,
       you might have been
       hit by a truck.
         Everything's gonna
         be all right.
 You're sitting on my painting!
      Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
              -It's all right.
              -Oh.
         -You wanna fill that
         with orange juice?
         -Who's it for?
   -Aunt Helen.
   -Mike, these are finished.
    Susan's gonna help you.
     Susie, take these in there,
     will you? Thank you.
    ROSEMARY: Okay, I'm gonna
    put these on the table.
        Oh, hey, Rusty.
  -You wanna be
  a cocktail waitress?
  -All right. Which is which?
    Aunt Helen, Uncle Daddy.
      HELEN: What's this?
      FRANK: An alligator.
   HELEN: A flying alligator?
   FRANK:
   See the two little babies?
        Two little babies.
        And these are from Mars,
        I suppose.
     They're very good.
     Oh, thank you. Rusty?
     FRANK: Hold it, Susan.
    How about a toast
    to our guest, everybody.
    Through the teeth and
    over the gums. Look out,
    stomach, here it comes.
       Hold the Dylan Thomas
       till later, Greg.
   To our charming dinner guest,
   welcome aboard.
     Thank you. Thank you.
        It's delicious.
  Oh, that's just wonderful.
  And where was Veronica born?
           -In Japan.
           -In Japan.
  I call her my little
  fortune cookie because
  she came right after dinner.
           (LAUGHING)
         That's funny.
       Where's the fire?
       Dinner is served.
     Oh, dinner is served.
 I want you to know that
 Rosemary and Louise
 cooked this dinner themselves.
    Oh, wonderful, wonderful,
    wonderful. That's absolutely
    wonderful, Rosemary.
    -I'm Susan.
    -Oh, of course you are.
       -And don't you ever
       change, honey.
       -Let's go, Susan.
  You have a wonderful family.
     They're all just wonderful.
     Absolutely wonderful.
      Wonderful, wonderful,
      beautiful children.
       Just so wonderful.
    Whoa! Watch that first step.
    That's a dilly.
   Greg, will you hold the chair
   for our guest?
             Sure.
        Thank you, Greg.
        Thank you, Greg.
        VERONICA: I'm hungry!
        FRANK: Veronica.
       -Bless us, O Lord...
       -(HICCUPS LOUDLY)
        (ALL SNICKERING)
           Pardon me.
         And these, thy gifts,
         which we are about
         to receive...
           (HICCUPS)
           (LAUGHING)
           Pardon me.
    From thy bounty
    through Christ our Lord.
        (HICCUPS) Amen.
      -You all right?
      -Oh, wonderful, wonderful,
      wonderful.
      VERONICA: I'm hungry.
      Can I have a potato?
   (ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
     RUSTY: Pass it around.
      -I'm hungry!
      -I want some bread.
     -Hey, come on,
     I want the bread.
     -Can I have some milk?
     Here, want some milk?
      I can do it myself.
   Sure, you can do it yourself.
   Certainly you can.
         Sure you can.
       Boy, is it warm in here!
       Don't you think
       it's warm in here?
            -Want some potatoes?
            -Yes.
          There we go.
        -You want some potatoes?
        -Okay.
 -Okay, there you are.
 -Hey! You got it on my dress!
           (LAUGHING)
           Oh! I'm...
            -Hey!
            -Oh. Oh!
           (LAUGHING)
    HELEN: Oh, good heavens!
           (LAUGHING)
         Oh, I'm so...
     I'm sorry, honey.
     Oh, I'm so sorry. I...
        Rosemary, help Veronica
        get cleaned up.
      -I didn't mean it.
      -I'll clean her up.
           (SOBBING)
           I'm sorry.
     I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
     I don't know
     what's wrong with me.
  What a terrible thing to do.
       I'm... (LAUGHING)
      (SOBBING) I'm sorry.
           (LAUGHING)
    Dick, I feel sick again.
  -It's Frank.
  -Oh, Lord, what have I done?
     -You haven't done anything.
     -Yes, I have.
     I've fallen in love,
     that's what I've done.
 I promised myself
 I'd never fall in love again.
 And I wanted to make
 such a good impression on you
        and your children,
        and now I've been acting
        like an idiot.
     And I don't know why.
       I don't know why.
         I just feel...
   Oh, if this damn room
   would stop rolling around,
           -maybe I could find
           someplace to be sick.
           -Louise,
   you better show Mrs. North
   the bathroom and help her.
       -This way.
       -I don't know why.
       I don't know why.
       The court of inquiry
       is now in session.
              Oh.
      You didn't have to
      wait dinner for me.
     FRANK: We've decided to use
     our company manners.
  Helen, the boys
  have something to tell you.
  Mrs. North,
  I apologize for putting
  all that gin in your drink.
    Oh, that's what did it.
      And I apologize
      for all that vodka.
        And I apologize
        for the Scotch.
      Scotch, vodka and...
 Helen, you've been the victim
 of an alcoholic Pearl Harbor.
      It's amazing
      you survived at all.
   Your bartenders
   will be dealt with later.
      Oh, please. Please, Frank,
      don't blame them.
          At least what they did
          was honest.
    They don't want
    another mother,
    and I don't blame them.
       And you, Frank...
    Frank, I think you should
    be on your ship at sea.
    That's where you belong.
  And if the children
  don't want me, I understand.
        Now, hear this.
  My interest in you has nothing
  to do with securing a mother
  for my children.
       They don't deserve anyone
       as good as you.
   Furthermore, I have no desire
   to go back to sea.
   In fact,
   if you'll have me, Helen,
   I'll be happy
   to remain ashore forever,
 because I happen to love you.
   And nobody
   put anything in my drink.
   -Oh, Frank, do you mean that?
   -Of course I mean it.
 That's why I said it
 in front of so many witnesses,
          untrustworthy though
          they may be.
           Oh, Frank.
     I give it six months.
     (WEDDING MARCH PLAYING)
    FRANK:
    It was a typical wedding.
    Enemies of the bride
    on the right, enemies
    of the groom on the left.
      I've seen firing squads
      with more compassion.
    HELEN:  When I saw
    all the children lined up,
      I wondered if Frank and I
      really had the right
      to do this to them.
     All you had to do was look
     at those faces to guess
     what they were thinking.
      MIKE:  All those
      photographers outside,
      they're gonna plaster
      our pictures all over
      the newspapers and TV.
          We won't be a family.
          We're going to be
          a freak show.
JANETTE:  When the kids
 at school find out about this,
 I'm gonna kill myself.
     COLLEEN:  I wonder why
     they're getting married.
        Can there possibly
        be a physical thing
         between them too?
       ROSEMARY:  At their age?
       GREG:  Yuck!
  VERONICA:  She has mean eyes.
   HELEN:
    How can I do it to them?
    How can I do it to Frank?
       All I have to do
       is be very calm,
       turn around and run.
     On your mark, get set...
         FRANK: Helen.
       Damn the torpedoes.
       Full speed ahead.
         (INDISTINCT TALKING
         AND LAUGHTER)
   -Here.
   -What do you do with this?
              -Throw it, stupid.
              -Oh.
              Hey!
      (CHILDREN SHOUTING)
          Cut it out!
   The snow came
   a little early this year.
      GIRL: He started it!
        That's no way to act
        at a wedding.
        That's not nice!
  Oh, don't worry about a thing.
  We'll take care
  of the children.
  -Sure. Even if it kills us.
  -It's only for the weekend.
       We'll be back Monday.
       Goodbye, Janette.
        -Goodbye, Mommy.
        -Be a good girl.
           -Goodbye, Tommy.
           -See you.
         Goodbye, Greg.
        -(GREG EXHALES)
        -Goodbye, Mike.
         Goodbye, Jean.
         Goodbye, Veronica.
         Goodbye, Mary.
  Goodbye, Louise. Bye, Jean.
     You already kissed me.
         Oh, I'm sorry.
  By the time
  they finish saying goodbye,
  the honeymoon will be over.
 Goodbye, Colleen.
 Take care of the little ones.
           -Goodbye, Phillip.
           -(SNEEZES)
           -What's that?
           -Nothing.
        Maybe pneumonia.
         Oh, good heavens.
         Frank. Frank?
     Frank, tell me if you think
     he has a fever.
       I do it back here.
           -He might.
           -Oh, dear.
    -Do I have to go to school?
    -HELEN: Frank, I can't leave
    if Phillip's sick.
  Never in our entire married
  life will all of our kids
  be healthy at the same time.
 But last year he had asthma.
 His lungs haven't been too...
         -What's the matter?
         -Something's wrong
            with Phillip.
        Get him to bed.
        Call the doctor.
  We'll phone you soon as
  we check into our hospital.
       I mean, our hotel.
  If it's the flu, call me
  right away. If it's anything
  more serious, I'll call you.
 No, I couldn't do that.
 I wouldn't know. Well,
 I better call you every hour.
          Make him stay in bed,
          and until you're sure
              what he has,
        keep the other children
        out of the room.
    Oh, be sure and tell
    the doctor that he's
    allergic to penicillin,
    all of the sulphas
    and some of the mycins.
            -Also tell him that
            last year he had...
                  -Helen.
 We'll go away some other time.
       Frank, thank you.
        FRANK:  I thought
         I saw the house cringe
         as we drove up.
HELEN:  It had been a dignified
 old Victorian home
 when Frank and I found it.
      The only one large enough
      that we could afford.
  FRANK:  The plumbing
   wasn't the most modern,
   the roof had to be repaired.
 But we had both fallen in love
 with it when we learned
 it had four bathrooms.
      HELEN:  So in we marched,
      the bride, the groom,
    one bottle of champagne...
    FRANK:  And 16 children.
 Come on, darling,
 finish your tea. Mother's
 tired and wants to go to bed.
    Now, is there
    anything else you want?
     Yeah, I wanna go home.
   We are home, dear.
   This is where we live now.
        Then why can't I be
        Phillip anymore?
  Well, who says you can't be?
           That man.
             -Frank?
             -Yes.
         And he says my name
         is 12-Blue-D.
 And if I forget I'm 12-Blue-D,
 I can't get into the bathroom.
           (CHUCKLES)
  Well, now, that's nothing
  to be upset about, darling.
  That's just a system
  that he learned in the Navy.
    Now, you stop worrying.
     I'm going to find out
     what's keeping that doctor.
     You stay in bed.
  FRANK: There you are, Janette.
  You are 8-Red-B.
       (CHILDREN CLAMOR)
  And, Mary, you are 14-Red-C.
       -Veronica.
       -What am I, again?
        You're 14-Red-C.
        Everybody's got a number
        from the oldest
        to the youngest.
 All the bathrooms are a color,
 all the bedrooms are a letter.
   And that makes you number 14,
   bathroom Red and room C.
        And this chart shows you
        where it all is.
     Could you just point?
   It's right around the corner,
   down the hall, love.
           Thank you.
       And, Veronica,
       you are 13-Red-A.
    VERONICA: Thank you.
    FRANK: You are welcome.
      Well, skipper,
      how goes the battle?
 FRANK: They're fighting it,
 but you can't beat the system.
  -I'm sorry
  if I upset your wedding night.
  -I thought it was yours too.
 I didn't wanna sound anxious.
    Susan, you are 9-Red-A.
       If I can find it.
        Champagne iced?
     Yes, it's in our bedroom,
     in a shiny new bucket.
       -Louise, you are 7-Red-C.
       -All right.
    If we stay on schedule,
  my system will have these kids
  bedded down in a half hour,
    and it's our turn next.
    Greg, you are 6-Blue-B.
         Aye, aye, sir.
         I'll send up a flare
         if I get lost.
 -How's Phillip?
 -That's what I'd like to know.
    -What's keeping that doctor?
    -Probably the rain.
   Tommy, you are 10-Blue-D.
    Why can't I have my own room
    to myself, like Mike?
  You're not the oldest. Next.
    You mean because
    I'm not in your family.
    -Tommy!
    -Now, look,
    you're all in my family.
   You have a beautiful room, D.
   It's around the corner,
   down the main hall.
    Oh, honey, wait.
    That's where Phillip is.
             -Phillip?
             -Yes.
         Ooh, yes, number 12.
         You're right.
 I know he has the flu.
 No one should sleep in there.
        That's the beauty
        of this system.
         It can be changed
         in an instant.
       All right, now hear this.
       Now hear this.
   All C's and D's
   report to the quarterdeck.
        There's been
        a slight rearrangement.
        It may affect B.

         Don't worry we have
         some emergency candles
         right in here.
          -Helen.
          -Yes, dear.
 Frank, do you think
 there's a power failure
 all over or just in the house?
   (ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
   Greg, take these downstairs.
   Get some light downstairs.
    GREG: Where's 6-Blue-B?
    I found my room,
    but there's rain
    coming through the roof.
         That's not possible.
         They just finished
         re-shingling.
           Well, they'll finish
           on Monday.
    -I'll go get some
    pots and pans.
    -How old is this house?
    Never mind.
    It's gonna be beautiful.
  -Take care of the little ones.
  -Sister's locked
  in the bathroom.
  -What sister?
  -I don't know her name yet.
       But she can't get out
       and we can't get in.
         And it's my turn.

  No, Doctor, we're not praying.
  The lights went out.
    Come on in.
    I'll give you a candle.
   What happened to the key?
      JEAN: It fell out,
      and the lights went out,
      and I can't find it.
      -Well, light your candle.
      -JEAN: I came in here
      before the candles.
            (SIGHS)
  Well, look, I'm gonna pass you
  a match through the keyhole.
   You light it, find the key
   and unlock the door, okay?
          JEAN: Okay.
          Here comes the match.
          You see it?
         JEAN: Uh-huh.
        -Got it?
        -JEAN: I got it.
        -Well, light it.
        -JEAN: I can't.
            Why not?
   JEAN: Mommy won't
   let me play with matches.
    -Helen!
    -Yes, dear, I'm coming.
  Tell her it's all right
  to light a match,
  find the key, open the door.
         -Who's in there?
         -One of yours.
      The one that's not allowed
      to light matches.
 Oh, Jean. Jean, darling,
 it's all right to light
 a match this time, sweetheart.
  All right, show's over.
  Everybody back to your room.
   Go back to your room.
   You go back. You go back.
       -I'm the doctor.
       -Hold your candle higher,
       will you?
  HELEN: Jean? Jean, darling.
      I did it. I did it.
    -You certainly did.
    -Here's your flashlight.
  Now, go to your room, dear.

     I'm 11-Red-A.

  Oh, no, no. It's not her,
  it's my... Our boy Phillip.
     I don't know whether
     I'm 14-Red-X or what.
         How do you get any food
         around here?
     What's the name
     of this organization?
    (CHUCKLES) No, I'm sorry
    it's a little confusing,
  but, you see,
  we were just married today.
      Congratulations.

      ought to be a lulu.

   No. You'll have to excuse me.
   You go right down there.

         doing in here?
         -It's our room.
         -Yeah, room B.
     Oh, Janette, Colleen,
     I'm surprised at you.
      -Get out of the boys' room
      this instant.
      -But it's our room.
   It's on that stupid board!
         We're on the board too,
         you know!
      Get out of our room!
    Hey, knock it off!

  are wonderful, but your
  he's and she's are mixed up.

       (THUNDER RUMBLING)
   Oh. You found him, Doctor.
     No, that's not him.
     This one doesn't have
     a temperature either.
   Oh, but that's Phillip.
   He's the one that's sick.
       Pulse, normal.
       Blood pressure, normal.
       Temperature, 98.6.
      In medical school,
         they told us
      that means healthy.
            Phillip.
      I feel better now.
      He's a good doctor.
        (ALL CLAMORING)
  Good news, Mr. Beardsley.
  Your son's not sick at all.
 Oh, great. But keep it quiet.
  I'll never get
  the C's and D's back into B.
             Sorry.
   Would you do me a favor
   and call my wife and tell her
   I'm on the way home?
           -Tell her thank you.
           -For what?
  We don't have any children.
     (CLAMORING CONTINUES)
         Is this the Beardsleys'
         new house?
     We've come
     to deliver the babies.
       Oh, have a heart.
   Leave them on
   somebody else's doorstep.
          Here we go.
     Dad! Dad! Come quick!
    They've brought
    Joan and Germaine home.
    GIRL: Come on. Come on.
     FRANK: Joan! Germaine!
         Hi, everybody.
   (ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
   MIKE: It sure was nice of you
   to bring them in the rain.
    Blame your crazy father.
    He insisted the family had
    to be complete tonight.
   NANCY: When he used
   that Navy voice, we didn't
   wanna be court-martialed.
       They can't argue,
       and I needed someone here
       on my side.
  -Let me see that little angel.
  -Aw, bye-bye.
 -We'll bring their things
 in the morning.
 -Thank you, Nancy. Good night.
       Good night, Helen.
       Good luck, Frank.
      What a little doll.
        Well, Murderers' Row
        is now complete.
 -Can I hold my sister?
 -FRANK:
 Let's get one thing straight.
  There's no more "mine"
  and there's no more "yours."
    From now on, everyone
    and everything is ours.
        All right, troop,
        to bed, to bed.
         -Is this our house now?
         -Yes, dear.
       Can we invite
       some friends over?
         (HELEN GROANS)
        Mrs. Beardsley.
    Hey, you look beautiful.
   -You mean for a mother of 18?
   -I mean for a bride.
    Frank,
    this is gonna sound silly,
    but you know something?
 -I'm nervous.
 -You know something? So am I.
  What did that girl say
  about you? You are a tiger.
  A slightly gray,
  slightly middle-aged,
  but very much in love tiger.
 Oh, Frank. Frank,
 do you think it can work out?
   Will we ever, ever
   really be just one family?
       Of course,
       but it's up to you and me
       to set an example
   tonight, in togetherness.
          There's rain coming
          in our room.
            -Can we sleep here?
            -Please?
   Hey. I'm not gonna sleep
   in that big room all alone
     if I'm not even sick.
         Togetherness.
        (ALARM RINGING)
  FRANK:  Every morning
  at four bells, our day began.
   After all, running a family
   of 18 children isn't simple,
   but it can be done.
   The secret is organization.
     A job for everyone,
     and everyone on the job.
     I was always the first one
     to spring into action.
           (MOANING)
   Mutiny was simply
   not tolerated.
   My crew grumbled but obeyed.
   They knew their captain only
   did what was best for all.
     Up anchor, man the mizzen,
     fire when ready.
      Mission accomplished.
   HELEN:  Tommy's job was
   to check the weather report
     to determine
     the uniform of the day.
      20% chance of rain.
            (SIGHS)
  PHILLIP:
  My job was to brush my teeth.
         It wasn't easy.
  Maybe if he'd
  helped me sooner,
  they wouldn't be falling out.
  HELEN:  Even without teeth,
   breakfast at the Beardsleys'
   included
      five pounds of bacon,
     two gallons of oatmeal,
        three dozen eggs,
        and 40 pieces of toast,
        unless I missed.
    And that was only
    to hold them until lunch.
   FRANK:
    Which they couldn't prepare
    without the old skipper.
    After 20 happy years
    in the Navy, I had at least
    learned how to deal.
     PHILLIP:  Breakfast was
      the best meal of the day,
      if you had long arms.
         I don't care much
         for eggs anyway.
   And I can live without bacon
   if I have to.
        Although some people
        are pigs about it.
     But if a fellow can't even
     have a piece of toast,
     he's finished.
  I could starve to death right
  at this table, and nobody
  would even stop eating.
         (HORN HONKING)
    -School bus is coming.
    -Get your rain boots on!
        (ALL CLAMORING)
      Phillip, stop dawdling.
      Now, come on, dear.
   PHILLIP:  There was nothing
    else to do. I had to invent
    the oatmeal sandwich.
       Come on, Phillip.
  FRANK:  This is where
  my system proved so valuable.
   The rain boots were all
   in one closet, where they
   could be reached instantly.
 We had learned
 to buy boots and shoes
 and clothes in wholesale lots.
    Sizes didn't matter,
    because eventually
    everything fit everybody.
   PHILLIP:  Almost everybody.
       Don't worry, Phillip,
       just keep growing.
 Someday you can fill my boots.
       That's my brother.
      (INDISTINCT TALKING)
  LARRY: We got some wild things
  planned. You've gotta come.
  It'll be out of sight.
             -Hi, Larry.
             -Hey.
      The gang is throwing
      a freak-out tonight
      at the beach house.
    Tell your parents
    we're going to a movie.
     Oh, Larry, I couldn't.
 Oh, here we go again. Why not?
   -I heard about those parties.
   -I can't wait to find out
   if it's true.
      Well, I'm not going.
          -You are unbelievable.
          -I am?
           -It's that ridiculous
           family of yours.
           -Oh!
         You're medieval.
         You're so hung up,
         it's pathetic.
       Do you know what you are?
       A sex maniac.
    If I'm a sex maniac,
    I'm the most frustrated
    sex maniac in the world.
           -And I'm almost
           out of high school!
           -Big deal!
              Oh!
      That's fine.
      All right, children,
   finish up your problems
   and bring in your papers.
      Thank you. Thank you.
      Thank you. Phillip.
      You didn't sign
      your paper properly.
    -Your name is Phillip North.
    -I'm Phillip Beardsley.
    We all went to church,
    and we were all married.
    -I'm Phillip Beardsley.
    -No, dear, not legally,
     and we must sign
     our legal names
     in school, mustn't we?
       -Beardsley.
       -No, dear, North.
 CHILDREN: North! North! North!
           Beardsley! Beardsley!
           Beardsley!
      (CHILDREN SHOUTING)
  I got here as fast as I could,
  Sister Mary.
  What is it this time?
   Why don't you ask Phillip?
            Phillip.
        -Darling, what happened?
        -Nothing.
       -Who did that to you?
       -One of the kids.
        She started it.
        -She says I'm not legal.
        -What?
 -And Mike isn't my brother.
 -Of course he's your brother.
        -Then my name
        is Phillip Beardsley.
        -Phillip North.
     There she goes again.
       Sister, couldn't you
       just call him
       Phillip Beardsley?
 I'm sorry,
 but the school requires
 that we use their legal names.
  Let's go to another school.
    I understand your legal
    problem, but you must
    try to understand mine.
    You see, I'm trying to bring
    two families together,
   and this is the first sign
   that I may be succeeding.
    I really would appreciate it
    if you'd let Phillip
    sign his name Beardsley.
    But legally it's North.
        But it's more important
        that emotionally
        it's Beardsley.
             North.
            -Beardsley.
            -North.
           Beardsley! Beardsley!
           Beardsley!
   Watch out, Mom.
   You might get a black eye.
  FRANK: You mean,
  I adopt your children,
  and you want to adopt mine?
  Yes, that way
  we'll really be one family.
  Your children
  will have a mother, legally,
 and mine
 will have a father, legally.
 That way they'll be protected.
      You know, in case anything
      should happen
      to either one of us.
       -Strawberry or raspberry?
       -Apricot.
  Do you know that in California
  it costs $250
  just to adopt one child?
        -Really?
        -That's a lot of money
        for a formality.
 A black eye isn't a formality.
          -How much milk?
          -20 quarts.
        Sixteen, 18, 20.
          What we ought to adopt
          is a cow.
       These are for Dad.
  Two hundred and fifty times 18
  is $4,500.
         -How did you figure
         that out so fast?
         -Sheer panic.
  Well, hello, Mr. Beardsley.
   Should I wrap it,
   or you gonna eat it here?
  All right, Harry,
  just call out the reserves.
  Dave, Jack, it's an emergency.
  The Beardsleys are here.
  More boxes.
    -Frank, you know
    what I'd like for Christmas?
    -Hmm?
    -What?
    -Don't buy me anything.
 The most expensive gift
 in the world is when a wife
 says, "Don't buy me anything."
  Look, if we didn't give
  each other Christmas gifts,
   and if we didn't get
   the new car, and we cut down
   on all the little things,
   the things we don't really
   need, the little luxuries,
       couldn't we afford
       to adopt our kids?
      Thank you, Dad.
      Oh, would you put these
      back there, please?
           (EXHALING)
          -Is that it?
          -That's it.
  Would you care to check it?
  How could you decide something
  like that without asking us?
 Colleen,
 we thought you children
 would be happy to be adopted.
    Happy to forget
    our real father's name?
      -Get lost in a jungle
      full of Beardsleys?
      -Now, just a minute.
     Mother,
     that's the most awful thing
     I've ever heard.
 He's hardly been gone a year,
   and you're trying to wipe him
   out of your life
   as if he never existed.
  And I thought you loved him.
           (SOBBING)
       -I like Beardsley.
       -Oh, you be quiet!
       -And no,
       I don't want any dessert.
       -I'll take his.
 Sorry, I didn't think I was
 committing a federal offense.
         Thought they'd want me
         for a father.
    Yeah, well, now you know
    what they think of you.
      Stay out of it.
      It's their problem.
  Now, wait a minute, Rosemary.
  It's not just their problem.
     I was planning on adopting
     all you children too.
     -Was that part of the deal?
     -Yes.
 I thought
 everybody understood that.
 We want this to be one family.
           Excuse me.
    -What's the matter with him?
    -What do you think?
    I gotta do my homework.
  Homework? He's really shook.
 ROSEMARY: Why shouldn't he be?
  We loved our mother
  just as much
  as they loved their father.
     I know that, Rosemary.
       And now you're asking us
       to bury her again?
          -Who's getting buried?
          -Shh!
  -Come on,
  we'll get you washed.
  -(VOICE BREAKING) Excuse me.

   if everybody's gonna cry!

      have been so wrong?
      -I feel like a murderer.
      -DARRELL: Merry Christmas,
      everybody!

     Merry, merry, merry...
             Merry.
        What a let-down.
       I walked in here,
       full of the old
       Christmas spirit,
   ready to tell you
   the good news,
   and it's a disaster area.
  What's the good news?
  I could use some right now.
         -Didn't Frank tell you?
         -No.
            Didn't you know
            you married Edison,
            the man?
         -I am?
         -That Fresnel lens
         landing system
 Frank and I worked on
 has been accepted by the Navy.
   -Oh, Frank, that's wonderful!
   -It's only been accepted
   for testing.
  Well, it's going
  on shake-down on the Big E.
  -Hey, that's cool.
  -When are you taking it out?
     I'm not taking it out.
    Since your father is
    anchored here, I volunteered
    to handle it for him.
   But, Dad, how come
   you're not taking it out?
      It just might be
      I felt it wasn't right
      to leave my family.
 But a shake-down,
 that's only a couple of weeks.
      You always used to.
         -Well, things are
         a little different now.
         -That stinks.
      -That really stinks.
      -I'd rather not
      talk about it, okay?
           Big mouth.
      -Frank.
      -You really sank the Navy,
      didn't you?
       (PLATES CRASHING)
         -Frank.
         -FRANK: Yeah?
    You really do wanna go
    to sea again, don't you?
     I'm not going to pretend.
     There's no halo on me.
          Sure, I suppose
          I'm a little envious
          of Darrell.
    But when I signed on
    for this cruise, I knew
    it was for the duration.
    You make me feel
    as if I'm World War III.
      Well, you shouldn't.
 Helen, I want you
 to know something,
 if you don't already know it.
   I'm happier than
   I've ever been in my life.
   I've already gotten
   what I want for Christmas.

   three wagons, a fire engine.
   This is the last bicycle.

  so many presents he had
  to leave some in the closet.

   I wrote him my legal name.
   I didn't want any trouble.

   "Phillip North Beardsley."

           of the situation.

 Doctor, this is Christmas,
 not April Fool. Are you sure?
    My dear Mrs. Beardsley,
    the reason I am in my office
    on Christmas Day
   is because I wanted to check
   the lab report personally.
   You do not have indigestion,
   ileitis or diverticulitis.
 What you have is a simple case
 of pregnancy.

     how to spell it, I do.
       -Thanks for calling.

    -You mean my stepmother.
      She's fine, I guess.

     -No, Doc, I feel fine.
     Not you, your mother.

      Should you do that?
  Why shouldn't I?
  What's the matter with you?
       Nothing with me,
       but I think you're
       out of your mind.
    Does it show that much?
      No, but guess
      who the doctor was
      at the draft board.
  Oh, I ought to report him
  to the Medical Association.
   No, he's gonna report you.
           (CHUCKLES)
         Bring that over for me,
         will you?
   You knew about it
   Christmas Day, didn't you?
             -And you still let
             Dad ship out?
             -Yes.
              Why?
    He wanted so much to go.
  Two people can't live
  with an ocean between them
  for the rest of their lives.
     -If you write him about it,
     I'll shoot you.
     -You would, too.
 I'd just as soon
 he didn't know
 about this draft thing either.
  Why not?
  Can't we tell him anything?
  No, I'm thinking about
  the Marines. That would
  drive him out of his skull.
      Oh. Okay. (CHUCKLES)
  -Do you really want this baby?
  -Very much.
    You see, he won't have
     to worry whether he's
    a Beardsley or a North.
FRANK:  The Navy, like a woman,
 has a way of
 changing its mind.
    Our short cruise
    was extended so often,
    we lost all track of time,
        until one day
        when the mail plane
        caught up with us.
       -Darrell, we're pregnant!
       -We're what?
    Mike's letter! Helen and I,
    we're gonna have a baby.
  -Our first.
  -Your first? Wait a minute.
        You can't even count.
        No wonder it happened.
        When is she due?
   When is she due?
   The idiot, he doesn't say.
     -Oh, no.
     -Let me read
     Helen's letter again.
     -Open some of those for me.
     -Yeah, okay.
     Here's one from Mary.
     I can tell
     by the strawberry jam.
 -Helen doesn't mention it.
 -Oh, Phillip gave you a tooth.
   Thanks. Colleen's in love.
     What, again? Wait a minute.
     What are we doing?
 You've had enough
 on-the-job training.
 Can't you figure out the date?
    It can't be soon.
    Helen would've told me.
      Oh, now, maybe she doesn't
      tell you everything.
  Unless Veronica
  is an impressionist, number 19
  is about to be launched.
      I've gotta get
      on that mail plane
      before it takes off.
          (INAUDIBLE)
  FRANK:
   Veronica's artistic endeavor
   was not quite accurate.
          A month later,
          we were still waiting
          for the stork.
 Every night we would go to bed
 wondering if this were D-day.
     Naturally, Helen was
     the most nervous of all,
    and it was compounded
    by the tension
    about Mike and the draft.
      She kept getting
      more excitable,
      anxious and emotional.
       Why can't a woman
       be more like a man?
             -(WHISPERS) Frank?
             -What?
   Oh! Don't make so much noise.
   You'll wake the children.
 I just want a glass of water.
      -Why are you making
      that terrible face?
      -I have indigestion.
       How often do you have
       that indigestion?
        -About every 15 minutes.
        -That's it!
    Stay calm.
    Everything's organized.
    Don't worry, everything's...
    I've laid it all on.
         Don't rush, now, Frank.
         I'm all right.
     -There's plenty of time,
     but hurry!
     -We'll get you there.
           Stay calm.
     Red alert! Red alert!
     Red alert! Red alert!
        Mike! Get the car
        out of the garage
         and warm it up.
    -Nicky, get her bag quickly.
    -We've done this before.
     Rosemary, Louise, Tommy,
     get blankets and pillows
      for the station wagon.
   -Phillip, what are you doing?
   -Going to the bathroom.
     -What, is the stork coming?
     -Maybe a whole
     flock of storks.
    I never thought of that.
        -Hey, Mike! What...
        -COLLEEN: (SOBBING)
         What's happened?
    Hey, stop it! Hey, Mike!
         What is this?
         Will you knock it off?
         Now, listen...
    Larry, what are you... Mike!
    Break it up. Knock it off.
    What is all this?
   Larry, why are you
   in our house at this hour?
       -RUSTY: Dad,
       Mom wants you right away.
       -Get the car.
  I'm hysterical enough
  without your help.
  What's going on around here?
      Nothing.
      That's the whole problem
      with your daughter.
    Mike! Will you cut it out?
    Look at you.
    You two, are you crazy?
          -(HORN BLARING)
          -(CRASHING)
        LARRY: My bike!
           -You all right?
           -(SOBBING)
  What happened? Hey, man,
  don't you know how to drive?
  -Look what you did to my bike.
  -My mother's having a baby.
   The bike's jammed
   under the car.
   We may never get it loose.
   Dad! Mom said they're
   coming six minutes apart!
       -What are we gonna do?
       -Get a crowbar
       and pry it loose.
           -What?
           -Not you!
    -Daddy, can I go to bed now?
    -Of course.
 Please, I can't talk
 to Mother right now.
 I've got to talk to somebody.
        Well, talk fast.
 Well, Larry says
 he'll never speak
 to me again unless I grow up.
   He says I'm being ridiculous,
   and I don't love him.
   But I do love him.
 -Am I ridiculous?
 -You're not being ridiculous.
   Well, do all the other girls,
   like Larry says?
      And am I just
      being old-fashioned?
    The same idiots were passing
    the same rumors
    when I was your age.
 If all girls did,
 how come I always
 ended up with ones who didn't?
  But it's all different now.
They wrote  Fanny Hill in 1742,
and they haven't found
anything new since.
   -Who's Fanny Hill?
   -Go to bed,
   that's who Fanny Hill is.
      -Ready, honey?
      -Thank you, dear.
      Oh, boy, am I ready.
     Frank, I think maybe you're
     gonna have to help me.
  -You all right?
  -Yeah, I'm all right, dear.
  I know this is a terrible time
  to talk about it,
  but Larry said...
   I've got a message for Larry.
   You tell him this is
   what it's all about.
    -This is the real happening.
    -Come on, Tommy.
    If you wanna know
    what love really is,
    take a look around you.
  -What are you talking about?
  -Take a look at your mother.
           -Not now.
           -Yes, now.
 It's giving life that counts.
 Till you're ready for it,
 the rest is just a big fraud.
     All the crazy haircuts
     in the world
     won't keep it turning.
     Life isn't a love-in,
     it's the dishes
     and the orthodontist,
    and the shoe repairman,
     and ground round
     instead of roast beef.
 I'll tell you something else.
    Going to bed with a man
    doesn't prove your love.
  It's getting up in the morning
  and facing the drab,
  miserable,
     wonderful everyday world
     with him that counts.
     -Are you all right, Mother?
     -Yes, dear.
         -Now, you kids
         get back to bed. Go on.
         -Go to bed.
       -Good night, Mommy.
       -Bye, Mommy. Bye.
         You all right?
 I suppose having 19 kids
 is carrying it a bit too far.
    But if we had it to do over,
    who would we skip? You?
    -All together, now.
    One, two, three!
    -Come on, this is light.
   -You got it out?
   -God, that's a heavy bike.
      -Okay, we got it out, Dad.
      -Take it easy.
      I'll get your legs.
   Thank you, Frank.
   I never quite knew
   how to explain it to her.
 If we don't get you
 to the hospital fast, the rest
 of it will be explained here.
      See you later, Dad.
   -Where's he going?
   -Hey, Dad,
   the hospital is that way!
             -Bye!
             -Bye!
        You'd think that was
        their first one.
         Oh! Why don't you
         get a haircut!
              Oh!
      Oh, I'm sorry, Frank.
      I'll ask the nurse.
  -They won't let
  the children in.
  -I told you, hospital rules.
 Could you hold him up
 to the window so they can see?
          -My husband says
          they're waiting.
             -Of course.
 HELEN: Is my family out there?
    NURSE: Not only the family,
    he must have brought
    the whole neighborhood.
         That neighborhood
         is my family.
 Honey, you'd better lie down.
       And if I were you,
       I wouldn't get up
       for three months.
           (CHUCKLES)
        Is he my brother
        or your brother?
    He's both our brothers.
     -Even to a nun,
     like Sister Mary?
     -Even to Sister Mary.
       Boy, is he lucky.
     Petitioner
     Francis Louis Beardsley,
     step forward, please.
   You are married to the mother
   of these children?
    -Yes, sir.
    -Has your wife consented
       -to the adoption
       of the minor children?
       -It was her idea.
       If I'm gonna be adopted,
       why can't I talk?
   Don't question the workings
   of a democracy, young man.
  At least until you're seven.
       -Has your wife consented?
       -Yes, sir.
  Will you execute an agreement
  in the presence of the court
      that the children shall
      be treated in all respects
      as your... Ahem.
     All right. Thank you.
   ...that the children shall be
   treated in every respect
   as your lawful children
  and shall hereafter be known
  as Colleen Marie Beardsley,
    Janette Dean Beardsley,
  Nicholas Richard Beardsley,
   Thomas Roderick Beardsley,
     Jean Louise Beardsley,
   -Phillip Anthony Beardsley...
   -I'm legal.
  ...Gerald Joseph Beardsley,
   and Teresa Rose Beardsley.
           Will you hand these
           to the clerk, please?
           Thank you.
     Helen North Beardsley.
           Yes, sir.
    There's been great fear
    expressed by many people
 that no one woman can give
 this large number of children
         sufficient attention
         and affection
    to allow them to grow up
    in a healthy atmosphere.
 But in this court's
 investigation of your home,
 the reverse seems to be true.
      All the children
      seem to be happy,
      well-fed and normal,
       the house amazingly clean
       and in good order.
      My wife has two children,
      one poodle
      and a full-time maid
      and can't seem
      to manage anything.
      What is your secret?
     Well, sir,
     a great deal of love,
      a little discipline,
     and a husband
     who doesn't criticize.
        (CLEARS THROAT)
   Michael Francis Beardsley,
   Charles William Beardsley,
     and so forth and so forth
     Beardsley. Will the minors
     step forward, please?
     -Michael Francis Beardsley,
     do you...
     -Yes, sir, I do.
       I haven't asked
       the question yet.
      I leave for Camp Pendleton
      in an hour. I was trying
      to speed things up.
     Besides,
     it doesn't matter much
     what this court does.
     You see, we held our
     own meeting yesterday.
     If you're interested
         in democracy,
     Helen North Beardsley
      was unanimously elected
      our mother for life.
   Three cheers
   for Helen North Beardsley.
      (CHILDREN CHEERING)
       Mommy, pick me up!
       Mommy, pick me up!
        -Here he comes.
        -Here he comes.
     Well, let's not
     get sticky about this.
     Never saw you carry
     a bag for your mother.
    -Mom's not in the Marines.
    -That's what you think.
    Mike, I know this
    sounds crazy, but it's gonna
    be lonesome around here.
          -With this mob?
          -(CHUCKLES)
  Good luck. You sure
  you don't want us to drive you
  to the bus station?
        No, thanks, Dad.
        I'd rather walk.
           Bye, Mike.
         So long, Mike.
         -Now, you take it easy,
         Phillip.
         -Okay.
   I don't know what to say.
    How about Washington's
    farewell to the troops?
        (ALL CHUCKLING)
 Well, so long.
 Don't everybody write at once.
        -So long, Mike.
        -Goodbye, Mike.
      (INDISTINCT TALKING)
        (MUSIC PLAYING)
