Trick or treat!
Happy Halloween!
Man, I see what
you're doing over there.
You're up, right?
Come on, hostess.
It's your play.
I feel like
it's your turn.
- Horny devil.
- Yeah.
I think Cheryl should go.
Who will I meet tonight?
Oh ho!
All right, Cheryl!
Stop.
I'm telling your mom!
Yo, yo.
Group up, group up.
Everyone say,
"Troy's number one."
Troy's an asshole!
Yeah, yeah.
Laugh it up, fuckfaces.
Who's next?
Come on.
It's your turn, Trick.
Trick. Trickster.
Let's go, man.
- Let's see it, pumpkinhead.
- Come on, Trick.
Oh, no!
Let's go.
It's your lucky night.
- No! No re-spins.
- It's just a kiss.
Just get it over with.
Don't be chickenshit, man.
Do it with a guy, Trick!
Yeah!
Come on, hey.
What's he doing now?
If it feels good do it,
Trick.
Hey! Lose the mask
if you're gonna kiss him.
What is he doing?
I'll get
out of the way here.
Let's give him a little
motivation here, huh?
Slow clap for Trick?
Trick! Trick!
Trick! Trick!
Trick! Trick! Trick!
Trick! Trick! Trick!
Trick! Trick!
Trick! Trick! Trick!
Trick! Trick! Trick!
Trick! Trick! Trick!
Trick! Trick! Trick!
Trick! Trick! Trick! Trick!
Trick! Trick! Trick!
Trick! Trick! Trick! Trick!
Trick! Trick! Trick!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Are you okay?
Let go of me!
Stop!
Please!
Stop!
Stop!
Get him, Troy!
You fucking psycho!
Shit!
No!
Get off!
Help!
Trick!
You batshit-fucking-crazy
son of a bitch.
- Hey.
- Hey, Mike.
Thanks for coming.
I know it's a long drive.
But they're gonna question
my every move on this one.
Did you tell them
that you're the only cadet
I ever learned
a few things from?
Like that'll matter.
Either way,
I'm happy to help.
You say that now.
Why does he have
that shit all over his face?
It was a Halloween party.
Okay, why does he still
have that shit
all over his face?
They were more concerned
with saving his life
than washing his face.
So this Patrick Weaver,
he killed four seniors
at a Halloween party?
Five.
Fifth just died in surgery.
Four more injured,
two critical.
One, Troy Meeks...
junior, football captain...
stabbed Patrick
with a fireplace poker.
Were it not for Troy,
there would be more dead.
He's 18 with no priors?
Trick killed Evan.
And Dan and Tammy and Parker.
- Trick?
- Patrick.
E-Everyone calls him Trick.
Did he have a beef
with the other kids?
He didn't have beef
with anyone. He...
He was quiet.
Smart.
So he was bullied.
Um...
No, he...
No, no.
Not that I know of.
He...
He used to help people
with their homework.
You should go.
I'll be in touch tomorrow.
Can I see Nicky?
Yeah.
She's upstairs.
We're trying to
find his parents.
As soon as we do,
you can talk to them.
Well, he's 18,
so parental permission,
it's a courtesy.
This kid
in the big leagues now.
And I'm betting that he's got
a date with death row.
Hey, how you doing?
Deputy Green,
this is Detective Denver.
We go back a ways.
Could you grab us
a couple coffees, please?
And take this.
How is he?
Hell of a scar
in his future,
but with a little bit of luck,
he'll be back on his feet
in no time.
Give us a minute, Doc?
I know they said this kid
did some terrible things,
but do I need to remind him
his rights?
No.
Patrick, you already know
Sheriff Lisa Jayne.
And, look, I heard
you're a good kid.
What made you
lose it tonight?
Were you provoked?
Did you feel threatened?
Were those kids
bullying you?
Hey, can we get somebody to come
wipe this crap off his face?
I'd like to see
who I'm talking to.
Of course.
Kid, you got to work with me.
If you want my help,
you got to tell me
your side of the story.
This isn't gonna do.
And the strong, silent types,
they don't last long
in prison.
And I got to tell you, you're
looking at more than life...
Help him out, Doc.
Which way did he go?
You see him?
- Oh, God.
- Let's get him.
Hey.
Come here, kid!
Hey!
Come here, kid!
Let her go.
- Hey. Stop.
- Come on, Patrick.
Don't do it.
Don't do it.
It's over.
- Fuck.
- Come on.
- You okay?
- Come on!
No, no, no, no.
Hey, did you see him?
Where'd he go?
Of course I saw him, shithead.
That's why I swerved.
Did you see him get up?
Oh, look.
This way.
Here!
Ah, shit.
He's in the river.
I've never seen
anything like that.
- How's he still alive?
- He isn't.
We put at least
three bullets in him.
He fell two stories.
Look at how much blood
he lost.
You saw his arm.
He can't swim like that.
He'll drown,
if not hypothermia.
He's probably already dead.
You saw it, right?
His eyes?
- Saw what?
- He was getting off on it.
He isn't anymore.
Trick Weaver is dead.
We'll set up a perimeter,
but I doubt we'll find him.
This is Sheriff Jayne.
I need K9 units...
From interviewing
fellow students, teachers...
"Trick was so quiet.
He'd never do that."
The old "quiet one" clich√©.
"Trick was," and I quote,
"smart as fuck.
Always made more sense
than the teachers."
Ever get in trouble? Suspension,
detention, anything?
Too smart to get in trouble.
History teacher of 27 years
stated Trick often made
the teachers feel incompetent.
What do we have to do
to get a picture of this kid?
No Facebook,
no Instagram, no Twitter.
If he used social media,
he was anonymous.
Weaver skipped
his class photo.
We asked the annual staff
to check the database,
see if they had any candids.
We also made an announcement
to the students,
see if anybody had any photos
on their phones.
So far, we got nothing.
This is all they have
before the video cuts off.
No footage of Trick getting up
or leaving the scene.
There's no shadow movement.
Really thin eyebrows.
Thin lips.
No.
Thick lips.
Skinny face.
Kind of
a hollowed-out face.
Black, roughed-up hair.
- Scruffy.
- Deep-set eyes.
He had green eyes.
- Beady.
- Blue eyes.
Just really
kind-looking eyes.
He could be anybody.
I saw him eyeing Trick
one day, and I was like,
"You planning
on messing with Trick?"
Then Trick,
who had to be 50 yards away
sitting at a picnic table,
turns and stares right at us.
No way he could've heard me.
Hell, we both went pale.
Troy was like, "Nah, man.
I ain't messing with Trick."
And Troy messed
with everybody.
We're wondering
if Patrick was bullied,
and we heard you might be
the man to talk to.
No, no, I don't know who's
been shooting their mouth off.
I ain't no bully.
Maybe I get a little rough,
but I never touched Trick.
Not him.
Until, you know, he lost it.
I saw there was a fire poker
next to the fireplace
when I was there,
so I just, like,
just one of those
animal instinct,
just clean shot,
just right in the gut.
I was dressed up
as a superhero.
Little did I know you have to
become the hero of the night.
I saved a lot of people.
Me.
He was sweet, you know?
I still can't believe
what happened.
What about his folks?
Did they know
he was like this?
Or did they make him
this way?
According to school records,
this is
Patrick Weaver's address.
Barge hasn't moved
in five years.
We don't know
where he actually lived.
We don't even know if
Patrick Weaver's his real name.
How is that even possible?
Kid goes to a school
for a whole year,
and no one checks his address?
- No one ever met his parents?
- E-mails.
Teachers spoke
with both parents by e-mail.
E-mails?
Denver,
it's been three weeks.
I'm starting
to get some pressure.
There's too many unanswered
questions to close this case.
And when were you gonna
tell me about
the two-faced pumpkin mask?
Who told you about that?
The mask was stolen
from your evidence locker,
and you don't
bother to tell me?
Because you would
assume it was him.
- Of course I would.
- Trick Weaver is dead.
Show me the body,
and I'll believe it.
I'm not saying
I'll quit looking,
but, Mike,
I got to put my resources
back on a county
that's been ignored.
Check this out.
Who is this guy?
What the hell
are you supposed to be?
Stupid kids.
Six dead,
three injured.
No one could I.D. him.
They're not even sure
he's a student,
but witnesses say
his face was painted.
You don't really believe
it's Trick.
We never found a body.
- W-We shot him, Mike.
- Yeah, we did.
But don't you think
it's curious that our guy
vanished into the river
after killing five teens,
and a year later six teens
are killed on the same river?
Do you think
he floated there?
I got to take this.
Everyone wants the
monster to live in the end.
Why is that?
Let's say he survived
the bullet wounds
and the freezing water,
and you return each year
to inflict revenge
as performance art.
Stop!
Trick's a regular boogeyman.
He's got a lot of fans online.
He's viral.
Saw those already.
Looking for a thread.
If there is one...
...I can't find it.
Hey there, Tricksters.
Welcome back.
It's that time of year.
You know what that means.
Our favorite killer's
coming back on this Halloween.
Fear him.
Trick is coming.
Fear Trick.
All three attacks
happened within towns
along the river,
farther south each time.
Tomorrow night,
it'll be one of these towns.
With the FBI's help,
we can stop him.
Trick wore a two-faced pumpkin
mask with face paint on it.
In 2016, the assailant wore
a white demon mask,
face paint underneath.
In 2017
it was a skull mask,
and though we have
no witnesses,
forensics confirmed that
there was paint in the mask.
His makeup design
changes each year
to hide the shape
of his face,
but I have no doubt
all three were Trick.
Why call him
by his nickname?
I've located
every Patrick Weaver
born in the States
from '93 to 2005.
Location, means, alibi...
none of them are him.
The name is a fake.
Look, I admit
it's an intriguing theory,
but if it was the same guy,
you'd have DNA.
We do have DNA.
Too much DNA.
The masks recovered
in 2016 and 2017
were covered in so much DNA,
it was like
they were drug inside-out
across a gym floor.
Does either of them
match 2015?
- No.
- Do they match each other?
No, but he's doing that
on purpose to fuck with us.
Don't you get it?
DNA results have given you facts
you don't want,
so you scream conspiracy.
I'm not screaming.
Look.
You and the lady sheriff
discharged your weapons
five times into the guy.
He fell 23 feet.
And that was before he crawled
into a 32-degree river.
No offense, Detective,
but the only thing
keeping this guy alive is you.
Have you considered
a copycat?
Of course I have.
The Internet refers to Trick
as some supernatural spirit
that comes back
every Halloween.
And you don't
want to believe them, but...
But Occam's razor
and all that.
All parts being equal,
the simplest solution
is most likely true.
Sorry,
but an evil Halloween spirit
isn't the simplest solution.
And it's not the same kid.
A lot of psychos out there
wanting infamy.
Better than some school shooter,
but not by much.
Look, it's midnight.
Gonna hit the pisser.
Next round's on me.
Yeah, right.
Happy Halloween!
No porn in here,
pumpkin.
That's your idea of porn?
I used to work
at a cop bar,
and that is cop porn.
Didn't allow it there,
and I won't allow it here.
And these two special agents
should absolutely know better.
Touch√©.
Really impressive how you
"Cocktailed" that vodka bottle.
Did you just turn
a Tom Cruise movie into a verb?
I did.
I approve.
Next round's on me.
Mm!
Wanting something to be true
just doesn't make it true.
Why did Swift
send me this?
What?
What the fuck?
Shit.
It's Swift.
Come on.
Jesus!
Swift!
Fuck!
Swift!
Jesus!
Hold on. Hold on, Sam.
We've got to...
It's okay.
It's okay.
Oh, my...
It's all right.
It's all right.
You're gonna be okay, man.
Hang on!
Hang on!
It's gonna
cut his head off.
We got it.
Denver, you got that?
It's too heavy.
Sam, let me... We got this.
Hang on.
We got you.
Denver!
Agh!
We're here.
Sam, just hang on.
We got this, Sam.
Almost there, Sam.
Come on, man.
Oh, fuck!
Sam!
Shit!
God, fuck...
Ah!
Fuck, man.
- I got you.
- God, fuck.
Hold it, hold it.
Agent Tina Mendez!
There's an officer down!
Yes, Piccirilli Avenue.
Fat Lou's bar.
One officer's down.
Yes, right away!
Denver!
Fuck.
Oh, shit.
Okay.
Try to stay calm.
Try to stay calm.
I'm gonna call it in.
This is Detective Mike Denver.
Got two officers down
at Fat Lou's bar.
Come quick!
He's right there.
Help's on the way.
Denver...
Shit.
Please don't.
Please don't.
Mendez, Mendez.
Oh, fuck.
- Hey.
- Hey, Cheryl. How's it going?
- Not bad. How are you?
- Good. Oh, I'm well.
- I'm well. How's your dad?
- He's all right.
- Oh, okay.
- Thanks for asking.
- I'll see you.
- Sure, see you.
They got my goddamn barn door,
Cheryl.
Who steals a barn door?
Well, it does have
sentimental value, Mr. Talbott.
Most kids I know carved
their name into that barn door,
like a rite of passage.
Think I don't know that?
Over 40 years
they've been doing it.
I only ever got rid
of one name.
Burned it off.
That damn door was special.
Careful, Talbott.
Folks will think
you have a heart.
- Doubt that.
- Thanks.
You seen Nicky?
Jeez!
Why you take self-defense?
Take Bikram
like the rest of us.
Namaste, my ass.
What do you want,
college girl?
So, Troy?
Oh, Troy sent you.
Great, got a message for him...
Drop dead.
Troy says he was
just studying with her.
Cheryl, I studied with Troy
all senior year.
He algebras
with his dick out.
"Drop dead" message
still stands.
Finally.
I'm tired of being a go-between
for you and that loser.
Oh, I got the twerps
on Halloween.
Want to take them
to the maze with me?
Greg and Janice
in a haunted maze?
They're gonna have
little heart attacks.
I know, right?
How funny will that be?
Nicky.
Detective Denver.
Hey.
Just Mike now, Cheryl.
What are you doing here?
I heard you got a scholarship
to State.
I transferred back
after dad's accident.
It's just the two of us.
Wanted to be there for him.
Yeah, I get it.
He's lucky to have you.
- How's he doing?
- Good days and bad.
But we're getting there.
So how are you?
Since the FBI decided
to kindly force my retirement,
packed up and ready to follow
the advice
of the immortal Fleetwood Mac
and go my own way.
But tomorrow's Halloween.
You aren't going anywhere
that takes you from this.
All these are Trick Weaver?
It's a theory.
My theory, anyways.
You really think
he's still after you?
No.
I don't think he's after me.
That's why I've got to go.
Well, we'll miss you.
Thanks.
Hey.
Take care of your pop.
Take care of yourself.
- See you, Cheryl.
- Thanks, Talbott.
Her dad
weren't no accident.
Shut up, Talbott.
You shut up.
Her daddy strolled up
that factory roof,
jumped right the goddamn off.
That's why the son of a bitch
turned that surveillance tape
off first.
It weren't no accident.
You know that's why
nobody likes you, right?
Everybody likes me.
All right.
Just breathe, rookie.
Just breathe.
Why?
Why would someone
take his eyeballs?
Keep it together, Slater.
- Keep it together.
- Hey, boss.
- Sheriff.
- Sheriff.
Keep it together, Slater.
What do we got?
Well, red truck
is the victims.
He worked across the street,
but somebody else
had a different plan for him.
I'll find him, get him here.
He's leaving town,
so make it fast.
Jesus.
He's back.
Don't start with that.
Then why'd
you bring me here?
Your name's
on the wall, Mike.
Exactly.
You made a lot of enemies
over the years.
It could be any one of them.
You're doing well.
You're doing well.
Okay, start off easy.
That's right.
Zebra.
Very good.
Okay.
Let's try another one.
Let's see.
Red.
Okay.
This is an orange.
It's the color orange.
This is an apple.
It's okay.
Plus, orange and red
are pretty similar, right?
How are
my two favorite people?
Look, Dad.
Do you remember his name?
Doc Steve.
Dr. Steve.
Yes, right.
Cheryl, can I talk to you?
Look, this is gonna sound
worse than it is, all right,
but insurance
has refused to pay
'cause there's an investigation
into the cause of the accident.
- They think he jumped.
- Yeah.
- He would never...
- I know.
Back in the old days
I used to go to conventions,
talk to patients
about treatments.
Now we start with billing
and insurance.
Look, the hospital knows
he didn't jump.
And so does the factory
for that matter,
who have agreed
to continue to pay
until this whole insurance
situation is worked out.
I just wanted you
to hear it from me
so you don't get stressed out
when they contact you.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
Dad?
What is it?
There's nothing there.
It's okay.
It's okay.
"Jayne, Green. Meet me
at the old crane barge at noon."
What?
I didn't send that.
Trick.
- Denver?
- Jayne.
Get to the barge.
Green is being set up.
Shit.
You didn't send that e-mail?
No, no, no.
Denver!
Sheriff Jayne!
Hello?
Green!
Green!
Green, you in there?
Yeah!
I'm back here by the shed.
Denver didn't send that e-mail!
Get out of there!
Jayne, Denver was right.
You got to come see this.
Green!
Oh...
Oh, God.
Radio's busted.
Call an ambulance.
It'll take them
15 to get here.
I'll have you there in five.
This is gonna hurt.
Okay?
Come out.
Give me your weight.
I got you.
I got you.
Okay.
All right.
Shit.
- Fast as I can.
- Oh, God.
Get back!
What?
Is it Trick?
Pull your gun.
- It hurts.
- Do it.
I'm gonna wing you around.
We lost him.
What the hell is that?
Doesn't matter.
It's just...
Got to just get you
to the hospital.
I got you, I got you.
Keep talking, Green.
Tell me about something.
I met a girl.
A girl, huh?
Do tell.
But do it while we drive.
Oh, no, no.
Shit!
Shit. Get out!
Get out, get out, get out!
Oh, fucking God.
Chickenshit!
I'm right here!
It's Trick.
Has to be.
Internet said he was back.
Psycho's viral.
He did this.
He did not.
Weaver's dead.
- This is a copycat.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Maybe you're right.
But where's Denver?
Maybe he did it.
Trick follows him
like a shadow, right?
Maybe Denver's Trick.
Shut the fuck up, Slater.
Do your job.
- Come on, rookie.
- Sorry, Sheriff.
- Come on.
- Sheriff...
- I shouldn't have said that.
- Let's go.
I'm so sorry.
Keep thinking I'll wake up.
He was a good kid.
This is one of the feds
that got killed
last year, right?
Reason you lost your badge?
Yeah.
He's trying to
make a statement.
Trying?
He's made
his fucking statement, Mike.
- Green is dead.
- I know that.
This...
This is beyond abnormal.
What does that even mean?
He murdered your deputy
with a gravestone
of a fed I got killed.
Who does that?
What does that?
Look...
I've never been a believer.
Ghosts, Bigfoot, aliens.
God, Satan.
I believe what I can see
and what I can touch.
But this...
This?
This is pure evil.
That kid
is goddamn darkness personified.
I told you,
I believe it's Trick,
but don't expect me
to jump on the devil wagon.
A curfew won't work,
will it?
Maybe if I leave town,
he'll follow.
I'll lead him
away from here.
No, he's past that,
and you know it.
He's marked his territory.
He's made his challenge.
So, what do you suggest?
I know a place we can go.
Somewhere we control.
And when he comes for us,
evil or not,
we'll make sure he doesn't
walk away this time.
Smooth Jonny
in the house!
- Whoo!
- There we go.
Yo, I know you're not...
- Hey, there he is.
- Give me that.
Forgot about Nicky, man.
She a real piece of work.
That shit nuts.
Hey.
To Trick Weaver.
I'm glad you're dead!
Yeah!
And... And... And...
And here's to Troy.
The man, the myth, the legend.
Skewered
the Benton High School slasher.
To the hero.
To the man!
To Troy?!
To Troy!
Yo, quick.
Shut up, hold up.
Could this be Trick Weaver?
Trick Weaver is dead.
But, Sheriff,
your deputy was killed
with the gravestone
of federal agent Tina Mendez,
the agent whose death
led to Mike Denver's firing,
and now we have sources
informing us that Denver's name
was written in blood
at the rest stop.
What sources?
So you don't deny it?
Like I said,
Trick Weaver is dead.
What?
Chill.
The dude's dead.
Trust me.
I don't know, man.
Never found the body.
Trick Weaver could still be
coming back for you, man.
- No, man.
- No, no, what if...
- What if... Shit...
- Trick's dead, yo.
I'm telling you.
I'm telling you.
So you're not worried
at all?
- Ha!
- No way.
Not just a little bit?
Just get another bottle
and hit Talbott's?
Fuckin' A.
Halloween.
- Hell yeah.
- Keep this party going?
Old man Talbott's
Halloween horror marathon.
What?!
What?!
Blood and guts
from dusk till dawn!
Blood and guts!
Blood and guts! Blood and guts!
Let's go!
Why here?
It's where it all started.
Plus the place is empty.
Nobody bought it
after Cheryl's family moved?
Would you
want to live here?
Would I want to live
where this evil prick
got his start?
- Hard pass.
- "Evil."
Mike, you got to cut that word
from your vocab.
There is no evil.
Look, forget my assumptions.
Consider the facts.
How many times
did we shoot him?
How many stories
did he fall?
How cold was that water?
No family, no history,
no future.
And yet he's the poisonous fog
that rolls in
and kills everyone without
rhyme, reason, or remorse.
You're confusing evil
with crazy.
This isn't crazy.
I know crazy.
Cops are crazy.
You're right.
Cops are crazy.
But it's different 'cause
we're not alone in our crazy.
I play Tuesday-night hearts
with cops.
I eat with cops.
I bowl with cops.
I fuck cops.
We may be crazy,
but we're not alone.
But Trick is.
His crazy is alone
and methodical.
He can join a Nazi group
on Facebook,
even build his rep in the feeds,
but not as himself.
No, the only ones
he shows himself to
are those hunting him.
He needs you.
And me.
The Internet isn't his audience.
We are.
So we stop believing
and he just goes away?
That type of thinking
will get you dead.
Oh, Trick is real.
But think for a second.
He's not always Trick,
is he?
Every day's not Halloween.
What's he do
when he's not taunting you?
Take it slow.
He could be in there.
County pays
for a security system.
No one can open a door
or window without me
knowing about it.
What was that you said
about getting ahead of him?
Wan, I need you and Slater
at Cheryl's old house.
Now we know what he's doing
in the off-season.
Ten-four, Sheriff. On our way.
I can't believe this kid
was right under my nose
and I never knew it.
Talbott's barn door.
You know in 40 years,
Talbott only removed one name
from this thing?
He's told the story often
enough.
Someone didn't
want to be forgotten.
Your windows and doors were
alarmed, so he dug his way in.
Sheriff, pulling up now.
Copy that.
- Deputy Wan, Slater.
- Sir.
- Denver.
- You sure he was here?
- Yeah, he's been here.
- And we think he'll be back.
So I want you both to...
Where's your SUV?
Have I seen a kid in makeup?
You're shitting me, right?
They're all in makeup.
It's goddamn Halloween,
Deputy Reddick.
Well, regardless, Sheriff wants
eyes and ears here tonight.
I got all the eyes and ears
you need right here.
But if I were you,
I'd go around back,
check out the maze.
Folks tend to get rowdy when
they've soiled their jeans.
Okay, Mr. Talbott.
I'll go do that.
- Thank you.
- All right.
1025 APB.
All units be on the lookout
for the stolen 2010
white Ford Expedition
belonging to Mike Denver.
Scary.
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna grab the tickets.
Greg!
Come on!
You're never gonna see
that movie!
He does not listen.
Oh, stop.
You told Cheryl you've seen this
a hundred times.
Why can't I see it once?
I don't want to see it one time.
You want to be scared?
The maze is where
the real monsters are...
not some dumb movie.
I don't want to be scared
neither.
All right, you guys.
I got the tickets.
Everyone ready?
- Yes.
- No.
- Which way?
- This way.
Greg!
Who the hell are these people?
Oh, man. They look like
they're on a shitty date.
They're having
a rough time, man.
Hey, how you doing?
You guys on a date or something?
Let's go.
Oh, shit.
Here we go. All right, boys.
You know the plan, right?
Same thing.
Ready to rock 'n' roll?
Okay. You walk around the thing.
You get in there.
- Five on five. Got it?
- We got it.
Let's go. Come on. Come on.
Let's go. Go, go, go.
Oh, hey, Mr. Talbott.
- Troy.
- One, please.
One?
Oh, that's great.
Troy, got to tell you,
I'm pleasantly surprised
to see you here without all your
emotional support animals
that you call friends.
Could it be
you are actually growing up,
leaving high school behind?
I graduated four years ago,
but...
I hadn't noticed.
Here.
Have yourself a mask.
All the kids have them.
Good seeing you, Mr. T.
- You too, Troy.
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks for coming.
- Any time.
Hey, Sheriff.
It's Reddick.
I have eyes on Denver's
missing wheels.
Copy that, Iris.
What's your location?
Deputy Reddick,
location, please.
I'm at the church,
in pursuit of potential suspect.
Reddick, do not pursue
without backup.
Copy that, Sheriff.
Come back, Reddick.
Deputy Reddick.
Reddick, report.
- It's starting.
- Shit.
- Hey, shitheads. Get in here.
- Freezing as fuck, dude.
Looked like old man Talbott
scared the shit out of you.
Talbott doesn't scare anyone,
bro.
- You kidding me? Oh, yeah?
- What you talking about?
- You're a tough guy, huh?
- Yeah, hit me, man.
I'll throw you down the st...
Oh, fuck.
Tell you what, Mr. Troy.
You and your shithead five
can make a healthy donation
to tonight's cause,
or I can call
that nice Deputy Reddick,
and she can read you
your rights.
What do you think?
- Uh...
- Pay up.
Get it out. Get it out.
Hurry up.
This isn't so bad.
Are you insane?
I can't stand this.
Can't stand what?
You haven't opened your eyes
since...
Maybe we should go back.
I thought you wanted to
be scared.
I don't want to be here anymore!
- Here. Help her. I'll get him.
- I want to go!
- I want to go!
- What about your candy?
I don't care about the candy!
I want to go!
There's not much sense
in my going to church.
God, this movie's boring.
- Give me some colors.
- Are you serious?
I knew we should've gone
in the goddamn maze, man.
- Yeah. Fuck that.
- It would've been way more fun.
Me and the cool kids over here
are gonna go...
Man, you are
such a little bitch.
You guys want to go out
to the fucking maze?
- No, no... Really?
- Better than this shit show.
You'll be all right.
Yeah. No, no. No hard feelings.
That's fine.
- See you later, man.
- We'll see you later, pumpkin.
Enjoy the fun
in this piece of shit.
Stop it.
You're acting like a child!
They're coming for you.
Look!
There comes one of them now.
- Denver, Sheriff.
- Hey.
Quite a posse you've got going,
but the first movie's started.
You seen Reddick?
Yeah. She went around back
to check the maze.
Wan, Slater, take the street.
Denver, let's check
the cemetery.
- Something wrong?
- Just be careful.
Okay.
Get my shotgun is what I'll do.
Just got to wait for...
Greg, wait!
What's wrong?
Did you hurt yourself?
Greg, it's the clown.
Different clothes.
Then it's a different clown.
He has a knife.
It's fake, Greg.
Look. He works here.
You're wrong.
Stay here.
I'll show you.
No!
Don't!
You're scaring the boy.
It's okay, Greg.
He's gonna let us pass.
Hey! Hey!
Greg! Wait!
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Greg!
See? He's gone.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Oh, my God.
There's Greg.
It's Trick, Nicky.
We got to get out of here.
You've been drinking
Greg's Kool-Aid?
Fuck off!
Oh, my nose.
Oh, I think she broke my nose.
- No. Let's go back.
- This is the way out.
It's just around him.
We're almost there.
Trick.
Run! Run!
What's that?
Oh, shit.
It's Trick.
Moviegoers at the church,
families in the maze.
It's like a killing ground.
We got to warn them.
Wan, Slater, we found Reddick's
body in the fire escape.
Call it in.
Denver, wait!
I need bodies
to lock down the church
and the crime scene
around Reddick... now!
Wait up, guys!
Get out of here!
Tell everybody you see to go.
There's been a murder.
Sheriff, it's me.
Jesus, Slater.
Stay here.
Alone?
Keep it together, Slater.
Sweetie, you got to run.
I can't carry you anymore!
- No! I can't! I'm scared!
- It's okay.
Greg, wait!
- Greg!
- It's Trick! He's here.
Greg!
Nicky!
Get down!
Human after all.
Denver.
Come on.
Fuck me.
- Shit!
- I could've killed you, Tal.
That makes two of us, Sheriff.
What the hell is going on?
Look, we've got trouble.
Deputy Reddick is dead.
Iris?
I need to lock down the church.
Any one of your costumed
moviegoers could be her killer.
Is it him... Trick Weaver?
I think so, Tal.
Let's go find
that little sumbitch.
Let's take a look at that arm.
Could've been worse.
You got lucky.
I don't feel lucky.
- There we go!
- Troy!
Troy!
Trick Weaver's back.
Oh. Hey, Cheryl.
What?
Trick Weaver is back.
Trick?
Troy, come on!
Hey, yo!
Wait up!
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah, let's get out of here.
Come on.
Come on.
Okay.
Deputies are on their way.
Shut down the movie.
The last thing I want
is Trick taking a hostage,
so go easy.
I always go easy.
No, you don't.
All right.
Come on, guys.
Everybody hurry up.
Everyone get in.
- Get them to the hospital.
- Okay.
Detective Den...
Mike... kill him this time.
Got your ass now, Trick.
I'm coming for you,
you son of a bitch!
Everybody down!
Well, if you're coming, come on.
Get in.
Sumbitch.
Aah!
What are you doing?
Go after him.
Not without you.
Come on.
Slater.
- Call it in.
- Sheriff, we saw him.
He's headed back into the maze.
Copy that.
We're on our way.
Secure the church.
Check everyone.
Let's go!
Troy Meeks is in the maze.
There's lots of people
still in the maze, Mike.
But Troy's the only one
who stabbed him four years ago.
You think he's here for Troy?
He here's for anyone
who slighted him...
you, me, Troy, Talbott...
and anyone we care about.
...everyone leave the maze now.
Hey, had a little too much,
pig boy?
You up, man?
Piggy went to the market.
Yo.
Be ready, dudes.
He's gonna jump up
at any moment, I'm telling you.
Troy, you got to come with us.
Hey. Yo.
Whoa. That... That was there.
We were just... We were just...
He's dead.
What?
Trick Weaver's back.
No.
I mean, no way.
Trick's dead.
He's not dead.
He's here.
And we think he's here for you.
Me?
W-Why me?
You stabbed him four years ago.
But I...
Trick doesn't think that,
does he?
Why wouldn't he think that?
'Cause, uh...
'Cause I...
I didn't really do it.
See, I-I mean,
I didn't even punch him.
That was Dan and the other guys.
I was just...
You stabbed him
with that fire poker.
Troy, that's what you told us.
Right, but...
s-she didn't remember doing it.
She was in shock, see?
I just figured
since she didn't remember...
that maybe I should tell
everybody it was me.
For her sake, I mean.
Who didn't remember?
Cheryl stabbed Trick
with that poker.
He saw her do it, too.
The hospital.
You don't think he really
wants to hurt me, do you?
Hey, what about me?!
Am I... Am I gonna live?!
Nicole Taylor?
Hey, I'm gonna go check
on my dad.
Of course.
We'll be here.
Okay.
I'll be back, kiddo.
Mom and Dad
will be here soon, okay?
I remember the day Mom left.
You asked me... if I thought
you were a good dad.
Well... I wish I could
tell you that, but...
I know things were bad
after Mom left,
but... she didn't just leave you.
She left me too.
Why are you doing this to me?
I need you, Daddy.
I-I'm alone, and... I don't know
what I would do without you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I wish...
I wish there was something
I can do.
But if... if you want to know...
...you've been the best dad
I could ever ask for.
I love you.
No. No. No.
No. No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
No.
No.
Dad. Oh, Daddy.
I'm so sorry.
The power's been cut!
- Emergency lights?
- They're out.
- What the hell?
- What happened?
I-I'm fine.
- I'll find Cheryl.
- She'll be with her dad.
Helen!
Help me.
Lock down the E.R.
- I'll come with you.
- Wait here.
Mitch, we need a
perimeter around the E.R., now!
All right, Sheriff.
Let's get you stitched...
Sheriff?
Nurse?
Code red!
What if we're too late?
Slater, keep it together.
How?
How am I supposed to do that?
He's always a step ahead of us.
It's not normal.
It's not human.
Hey. You're injured.
You should be in the E.R.
Cheryl, you, me...
That's what he wants.
That's why he's doing this.
Do us all a favor.
Don't make it easy for him.
Hold still, Sheriff.
- Go with him.
- You're bleeding out.
- I'll get the doctor.
- No. Go with Denver.
I'm sorry, Sheriff.
But I'd rather save you
than die with him.
Fuck, this kid likes pumpkins.
Wait. Wait.
Shh.
The little shit's
been at this for a while.
Hey.
Trick, don't.
What's he doing?
This is his moment.
We shot him.
Cheryl stabbed him.
Stabbed him?
Trick!
It was me.
Now what?
Spin the knife.
I shot you.
Okay?
Tonight, back then.
It was me, you dickhead.
There's no need to spin.
Keep them out of this.
I'm the one who's been
dogging you all these years.
I'm the one who's gonna keep
dogging you till it's done.
Choose me, you get to keep
stalking Halloween
for all of time,
like the demon you want to be.
Shit.
Thing is...
You?
You're not some supernatural
evil.
You're just a narcissistic...
Aah!
Trick!
No!
Denver... he's still alive.
I'm so cold.
Smooth Jonny in the house!
Got you.
Mike!
My God, Mike.
Oh, God.
Don't turn your back on them.
What the...
Who are you?
Stay back, both of you.
Stay back.
Stay back.
Slater, watch yourself!
Got your back. Check on Denver.
Oh, God.
Look at me.
All right.
Okay. All right. All right.
Slater, get a doctor!
Hey, Wan? Buddy.
I used to work at
a cop bar, and that is cop porn.
You.
Hey, pumpkin.
Next round's on me.
Hey.
Did you see him? Where'd he go?
Of course I saw him, shithead.
That's why I swerved.
I shot you in the maze.
You were all Trick?
People want a monster
that they can fear and hate,
something evil that makes sense
out of the random horrors
of their lives.
That's our trick.
That's what we give to you.
That's what we'll keep giving
to everyone.
Consider it a... public service.
You believed we were the devil.
Most grounded cop
on the planet.
If you can believe, anyone can.
Man, you just don't get it.
You're dying.
And when you're dead,
you're dead.
But after tonight...
...we'll grow.
And we'll grow more next year
and the year after that...
and the year after that.
All the sheep want to believe
the lie.
They need it.
'Cause the truth is...
no one needs a reason
to be evil.
We do this because we can.
Because we're good at it.
Now, I'd love to stay
and watch you die, but, uh...
...I really need to go find
Cheryl.
Aah!
Denver!
Denver!
W-Where is he?
Denver!
Hey.
Denver.
Get help!
Denver?
Denver?
Where did he go?
Where did he go?
No, no, no.
Stay with me.
Stay with me.
Denver!
Stay with me!
Stay with me!
If you die, he wins.
You want that?
God!
Where did he go?
Get a stretcher out here now!
Did you see him?
Where did he go?
There was... There was blood,
but... but no body.
He... He just disappeared.
He... He was gone,
just... just like before.
Like... some sort
of Halloween nightmare.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I just need to find my walkie.
I don't even need to...
Listen, if you don't calm down,
I'm gonna have my
anesthesiologist come in here
and knock your ass out.
Slater, over here.
Where's... Where's Wan?
Sheriff, I'm so sorry.
Wan's dead.
We were attacked.
And Denver?
Multiple stab wounds
to the chest.
He's not gonna make it.
What about Trick?
He's gone.
You.
You killed them.
You... You hurt me.
I guess your back
really is broken.
I hope that hurt, you fuck.
You and all the others like you
killed my dad,
killed Denver...
Fuck you...
and fuck your friends.
I stopped you last time, too.
I know your secret.
You're nothing.
And this time, you're really...
...dead.
One...
...of...
...us.
Here's another one.
What do you mean, another one?
Trick is a "they," not a "he."
And you're one of them, Slater.
What?
What do you mean, "one of them"?
You know me.
Sheriff, I'm not...
And here's the latest
on that strange murder spree
in Benton.
Police say at least three
different individuals
posed as one single killer.
But get this.
And this beat goes on.
And on and on.
- Two of us won't do.
- I know.
Our numbers need to grow
and grow and grow.
- Unstoppable.
- Up there.
Let's go.
So we move south.
- All right.
- This way?
Yeah.
- Good.
- Sounds good.
I'm gonna say this every day,
because every day,
I want you to know
you have a choice...
And every day,
I'll give you the same answer.
I'm coming with you.
Three Tricks are dead.
But he... they...
want it to look supernatural.
They found like minds to join
their little cult before.
And they'll find new recruits.
Probably already have.
But we find them.
And we will.
I got shotgun.
