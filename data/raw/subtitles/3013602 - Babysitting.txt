<I> The guy with the Ray-Ban is Sam. </ I>
<I> He works at Manpower. Since he works </ i>
<I> the number of female workers has increased from 32 to 80%. </ I>
<I> This is Alex, the nicest guy I know, but also the weirdest. </ I>
<I> He works as a courier, to the chagrin of his boss. </ I>
<I> He loves speed and Fast and Furious. </ I>
<I> Today is June 25. </ I>

Happy birthday.
Thanks, buddy. That's sweet. - Please.
Just kidding. It is a package for Aurelie Goudart.
Look what I found in the van.
Should you deliver anywhere? - As long as he does not claim it ...
Fantastic, eh.
And such a great zoom.
I'll see you, fatso.
What a fat guy. - I have to go.
See you for the groceries. Day.
That's like me. This guy takes me to his home.
He starts to fuck me. But then his girlfriend inside
while we are doing. You would not do that.
She's gonna freak out, "You fucked my friend."
I said, "Wait a minute, I fuck him, so he is my love."
And you know what she said? "What is your problem?"
I say ". Nothing What is your problem?" And when she held her tongue.
I fuck him, that's all.
Estelle, I ... - I fuck him, he fucks me, nothing more.
Wait, Mom. What?
I have to see the boss. - Why?
Hope for a better life. - Hurry.
I'm going to do everything alone.
Sorry, what did you say?
What floor are you going?
<I> Is that Scream 4? </ I>
And then? If you have no friends, go on Facebook.
What are you gawking at me like that? I'm not your sweetheart.
Get out of here.
Imbecile.
Sidney's cousin is the killer.
Goodbye, pus.
The rear is cut reason. A lousy courier.
Not really? On the contrary. I do not want to arrive in a wreck.
At one time we both have a break I want to take advantage of the convertible.
I have to show. Kiss.
What are you doing here? Are you new?
I've been working for two years at the reception. I'm Franck Amory.
What are you doing in my office?
I draw comics. I work here and hope I can show my drawings.
And today I thought, "I'm just going to ask and" ...
Thank you for calling me back.
ASAP.
Why, a week? It's just a mirror.
But it just depends what loose.
I come to you, I'll be there in five minutes.
Mr. Schaudel?
Do a squirrel after.
And now a dinosaur. - No.

My camera, now look.
Boys, so much alcohol?
You are 30. You want us to buy Kidibul?
But so much.
Laure comes. That there are already 33 - 33?
Who all? - Sandrine, Laure, Lucie, Claire ...
Who? I know of no one. - That's nothing. They are handsome chicks.
Especially Lucie, new on the job, with huge boobs.
She is married, but we forgive her.
Are there any chicks you do not like handsome? - Yes, your exes.
That is not love for your mother.
This is not for my birthday. You organize this party for you.
Well, if not confirm your friends ...
Who has not confirmed? - Sébastien, Sylvain, Sonia Lamar ...
Sonia Lamar, who does not.
Who is that? - My ex.
She also worked at Schaudel. Now she sells cupcakes.
I do not know her. When was that?
Last year, on her farewell drink.
<I> She kissed me on I Want You Back by The Jackson 5. </ I>
His long you been together?
Yes and no ... - When did you see her last?
At her farewell drink.
That was quite a relationship. - Many plans made sure?
Just stop. I gotta get back to work.
And do not laugh, you. You must pay for your chicks.
That again is not love for his mother.
<I> Hi, honey. Everything good? - Yes </ i>.
<I> The babysitter was attacked in the subway. </ I>
<I> That's terrible. - Yes, they can not come three weeks, </ i>.
No, I mean for us. Who is the little fit?
<I> If you go alone, I watch out Remi. </ I>
But it is the night of the publishers.
Everyone comes with his partner. What about me?
I'll find a solution. Big kiss.
My best Franáois, that's good.
Franck. - Also good. Do you have plans tonight?
Yes. - Okay, you come watch my son.
That is difficult. My birthday and ... - Franáois.
Would you like me Monday show your drawings?
Yes, but ... - Perfect.
19 hours, Rue de la ferme 7 in Saint-Germain-en-Laye.
We have everything in the house, but what could I say?
This opportunity I can not pass up.
Besides, can you bring me? - Where is it?
Rue de la ferme 7 in Saint-Germain-en-Laye.
Forget about it. I do not have my passport. - Is it so far?
<I> Yeah, who's there? - Hello, I'm babysitting </ i>.
Franáois day. - Franck.
Sorry, Franck. I'm Claire.
Thank you for coming fit Rami.
You're welcome.
Franáois day. That lasted long.
It is far away. Half hours.
Had said that, you could have a ride with me.
Good. I'll show you the house.
Come on in.
Can you take off your shoes? - Sure.
Thanks.
There is an artist in your son. - That's mine.
I paint since I stay home for Rami.
This is the sitting room, the remote controls
the television, the DVD player
the blinds, the curtains, and the fireplace.
The fish I have given food.
And Phoenix also.
A beautiful beast. - Marc is fascinated by ornithology.
A rare species. He has him for twenty years.
He got him before we knew each other.
There is the kitchen.
Rami takes morning Nesquik, a roll with Nutella.
Why in the morning? - We come back tomorrow around 18 hours.
Ah so? - I forget the most important.
Rami has asthma. This is his puffer in the case of.
In the cabinets ...
No, you can put anything on the cabinet.
That sign is all that Marc has his father.
He is extremely attached to it.
Your room is upstairs next to the playroom Rami. I will call him.
Rami, you can just come down?
This is Franck.
Say day, Rami. - Day Rami.
He is shy, within two hours is about.
Go give your daddy a kiss? He is loading.
Why does not he? - Please, darling. He's busy.
As usual. - What are we waiting for?
What's wrong? - You should come to the football.
I have to it for my work, not to play golf.
Next time I will definitely participate, I promise. - But it is the final.
The next time then. And I buy a sweater from PSG. Okay?
The pot.
I buy everything he wants and he is still not satisfied.
That's for you. We'll call you later.
Thank you. - See you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow. Good trip.
That's cool.
Mr. Schaudel! - Yes?
Your hedge is over seven feet tall.
I'm going to complain to the town if you do nothing about it.
Well you said, sir Monet.
Zagevent.
Rami?
Rami?
Au, damn.
Who said you could come in?
We are not so well begun, but that does not matter.
It's not too late. Will you come watch a movie?
Within 3 count my room if I say that you've been to me.
What? - One.
Two.
I hope everything goes well.
Do not worry. He's a serious guy.
I mean Rami.
Why would not it go well?
He becomes difficult.
This is normal. For example, children of his age.
We were rebellious when we were ten years.
He is disappointed about the football match.
We can ask the babysitter to take him.
Which car? Your brand new 4x4?
My Range? You can see that from here.
It's not the final, but you see him play again.
My dad never came to see the rugby and I've still a successful life.
Speaking well?
<I> Take off your shoes. </ I>
<I> Your shoes. </ I>
<I> I have your old man well known. </ I>
<I> Do you know that he is deceased? </ I>
<I> I did not know. How did he die? </ I>
Everything okay, Rami?
<I> Do you need something? - That was his weakness </ i>.
<I> How do you know? </ I>
<I> Do you want to watch the movie? - I tell you that he had a weakness </ i>.
<I> Listen ... - He could be someone </ i>.
You should not ... I know you ... - Take me to the carnival.
No. I stand before you and I do not want you getting hurt.
<I> Watch for The Departed. A good movie. </ I>
No. That I have seen.
DiCaprio dies at the end.
<I> Hello? - It is Claire </ i>.
<I> Day Claire. Arrived safely? - Yes, thank you. Everything goes well? </ I>
<I> Yes, very good. - May I speak Rami </ i>?
<I> He sleeps all. </ I>
Already?
<I> We have played a lot, so he sleeps very well. </ I>
<I> Then at least he's good. - Yes, indeed </ i>.
<I> Okay, tomorrow, Franck. - See you tomorrow. Thank you. </ I>
Where were you?
I walk you search for an hour. - I wanted to know how it was with Rami.
Patronize him not so. Here.
Who is it? - No one, to take a picture of me.
Come on, quickly, quickly.
You look beautiful. - Thank you.
<I> Yeah? - Hello, Mr. Schaudel </ i>?
<I> Yes. - This is the police </ i>.
If you live on the Rue de la ferme 7?
Yes, why?
<I> There's been an incident tonight at home. </ I>
An incident? What happened?
Difficult to explain on the phone. - Is Rami?
<I> Is it our son? - Your son </ i>
Yes, he is at home with the babysitter.
<I> I'm sorry, but there's no one here. - Why, no one </ i>?
<I> Hello? - Franck, it's Claire Schaudel </ i>.
No, ma'am, the police again.
<I> Apparently the babysitter left his phone at home. </ I>
What's ...
What happened?
Commissioner Laville.
Mr. and Mrs. Schaudel? - Yes.
Have you found my son? - Not yet.
There is a crisis created and sent out an APB.
Emitted at 3 am.
This is a nightmare. - Who warned you?
Your car was involved in one-run. That's why we were here.
My Range? - Yes.
This is agent Caillaud.
He proposes profiles of criminals.
The babysitter might have abducted our son?
That's hard to say now.
He is not known to the police and he has no criminal record.
But the biggest psychopaths often are not.
The biggest psychopaths? Do you mean child murderers?
Not required. Also rapists or organ traffickers.
Then we'll find them alive.
But not too optimistic that brings misfortune.
Did you have a dispute with the babysitter? - No.
This was below the bench. Perhaps a clue.
Is this yours? - No.
Enter here, it's maybe a snuff movie.
What is a snuff movie? - A murder filmed with an amateur camera.
We're going to watch it directly.
Connect it at that.
Quiet.
Ready, boss. - Can we start?
Go ahead.
<I> Good evening everyone and welcome to Alex TV </ i>
<I> "Laughter blown" with the aim of one million views on YouTube. </ I>
I know. What does he do for my home? - Who is that?
Idiotic courier who hit me yesterday.
Let you format a PV?
No, I have no points on ... he ran.
<I> We go over to our reporter, Sam. </ I>
<I> This is a big night as we come to the birthday of our size Franck. </ I>
<I> Is he crying? Laugh? Crying with laughter? </ I>
<I> We'll now explore. </ I>
<I> Exciting. - His boss there is well-off </ i>.
<I> He pays no taxes and put everything in Swiss accounts. </ I>
<I> He pays workers in black. </ I>
That is not true. What nonsense.
Yes, what nonsense.
There he is. Happy birthday.
What are you doing here? - Your birthday.
You want me to get fired?
And the small sleeps. - I love children.
"I love children." That does not sound good.
Sonia comes. - Sonia? That's a joke?
No, they confirmed on Facebook. - No way. Get out.
Call her to cancel.
I got her number. - Say it like it is here.
Let us inside. - I have the little fit.
We have thought of everything.
What is that? - A sedative.
Are you crazy? Why not ecstasy?
Ecstasy is too dangerous for a child.
A sedative as well. - It is vegetable.
Give him half a different dose.
No way. No party and I stand by.
Goodbye.
Are you sure he does not wake up? - They sleep until tomorrow.
Hold on. It's still risky. I hope it is not dangerous.
What time did Sonia come? - That there will be.
What a piece.
The mother is super handsome. But he does not get out.
He seems to be Gollum. - You are a bastard.
Why? - You insult Gollum.
They drugging my son and laugh at me. And I'm Gollum?
Wait till they encounter Gollum. On their bakkes.
And I'm Gollum?
Who is Gollum anyway?
I don’t know.
<I> Damn, calling the mother. </ I>
Put them my regards.
Silent. From the room. - Madam, I love you.
Silence you. - I did not say anything.
<I> It's Claire. </ I>
Claire day. Arrived safely?
<I> Yes, thank you. Everything goes well? </ I>
Yes, very well.
<I> May I speak Rami? - He sleeps all </ i>.
<I> Now all? </ I>
We have played a lot so he sleeps very well.
<I> Then at least he's good. - Yes, indeed </ i>.
<I> Okay, tomorrow, Franck. - Until tomorrow </ i>.
Sleep well, Adolfje.
Leave him alone, damn.
That's still not bad.
What is that? - The bell.
Sonia?
What is all this? You said only Sonia would come.
No, she would come. Not that she was the only one.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Good evening, everyone. Excuse.
It is very nice that you have come for my birthday.
And for the beer ...
And for the beer. A small problem. I fear that ...
Franck day.
Happy birthday. - Sonia.
What is she doing there? - Who is that?
She has worked for me. Until last year.
Sonia Lamar. I never forget a face.
Love that you came. - I had nothing else to do.
Well ... Welcome everyone.
Can you take your shoes off?
I told you he was funny.
No, really. Can you ... I mean it.
Where can I put this? - The kitchen is there.
Have you had problems with her? Dismissal, sexual harassment?
Not at all.
Rigot, I want the number for that Sonia Lamar.
This resembles the case Pascal René.
The case Pascal René? - A child that has disappeared.
Have you found him? - Yes, but not in one piece.
Look at the labels.
Just old wine. All expire. Look.
Stop it. I do not feel well. - What is it?
Have you seen Sonia? - Yes, and then?
Turn that off.
What's wrong with Sonia? - What a killer bitch.
I would leave my family for her. - You have no family.
Then it is less painful for them.
That you can not do Franck tonight. - I know.
Tomorrow. - You're right, I'm stuck.
Tonight I see Lucie, a married woman.
What do you do? - I'll take what Ruinart.
You take nothing with it. Back to top. - One bottle.
Put that back. Upwards. - What are we drinking?
Come on, Alex.
Have they given you drink?
It's nice, but far. - Yes.
Sonia, my friends, Sam and Alex. - Hello.
Hello.
This is Ernest. My sex buddy.
But no, he is my cousin. He is married.
And love. Hello.
Pleased to meet you. Sonia talks a lot about you.

Surprise. - Where's the party?
Damn, guys. You believe that?
Is not it a costume party? - No, sorry.
