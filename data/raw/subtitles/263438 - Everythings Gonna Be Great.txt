EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE GREAT
Look, I'll be here for at most an hour
Call me if you'll be late, don't keep
me waiting here. There was this guy
Önder, we were together in a boat
deal. We were to meet that day,
he called me, I went there.
I wait but he doesn't come.
I phone him, no one answers.
I was in front o f a kiosk. I was hungry
so I decided to eat something.
Ferdi, I'll sit here.
Hotdog and cola.
What's up?
- Who was that gesture for?
- What's going on, who's that?
That man over there
Hey, you creep!
- Who, me?
- You're the only creep around!
- Take it eas y guy s.
- Take that finger and...
- What is going on?
- She told you not to lick that
finger, you oa f!
- No need to be rude!
- Don't talk like an idiot!
- Why did you get up, pervert!
- Shut up, you bitch!
- Cut it out!
Stay out o f this son,
this is for big boy s!
I'll smash your head in!
Don't hit me, you son o f a bitch!
- Run Altan!
- I'll smash your head, I will!
- Your head's bleeding.
- Really?
- Don't touch the wound.
- My skull's broken.
Don't moan, we'll do something
You talk back to them, and then you
run away. I'm so glad I hit that girl.
What are you doing?
- Mind your own buiness
- What is this place?
- Wait, what are these packages?
- Sit down.
Is it a depot?
Sit down, I'll clean it up for you.
Don't move.
A pharmaceutical depot, what is
got to do with you?
- Don't talk!
- Plenty o f stuff here, eh?
Don't fidget Altan!
Quite a lot o f cash
How is Dad?
Are you really interested?
Scold me, don't be shy. I am the
ungrate ful son.
Dad is ill, Altan, he's not well
You never call him, is that fair?
Look, he's mad at you, too.
- Who, my Dad?
Our Dad.
- He's alway s mad. Where's he?
- The house at Sisli.
That chicken shack!
What a beating we got!
A fight parted us, and a fight
brought us together again.
Has it been 3 years since we parted?
- 2 years 4 months.
- So you counted the day s, eh?
- Still the comedian, I see. We are
finished Altan, you may go.
- Where to?
- To where you came from.
Wait a minute, we haven't seen
each other for years, let's talk.
- We talked, didn't we?
- What is this?
- Rasim Bey's locker.
- What's inside? Treasure?
- This's an o ffice, got it?
- Allright.
- I said an o ffice!
- OK, let's talk business then.
- What business is there to talk about
What is this pharmaceutical business?
Wholesale! Who buy s this stuff?
Why should you care? You're a real
pain. Every time I see you something
goes wrong.
- Why're you alway s getting at me?
I'm not that kind
o f a man, you exaggerate.
You came two years ago, and
said let's start business.
- Didn't we?
- And what happened? You ruined
the business Altan.
I have no faith in you, man.
Right, I do have such an image.
- Leave them, don't fiddle around.
- Allright, I won't eat them.
Haven't called for two years,
you bet I wouldn't
No entrance! A bedroom!
Still got your scrap book?
Do not touch them!
Put it down, Altan!
I drove an identical car,
it goes really fast.
To hell you did, that machine
is 320 hp, 0-100 in 5 seconds.
It will catch up with 355 at
startup. It's got ABD, not ABS.
ABD was... what was it?
- What's your job?
- I wanted to tell you, but you
didn't let me. I want to talk business,
but you're try ing to get rid o f me.
- I'm opening a bar
- You're opening a bar?
- Yes
- A bar?
You worked at the carpet shop?
- That's history.
- What about the y acht cruises?
- I get seasick.
The boats ran aground.
You were a tourist guide too,
that didn't work out either.
Didn't week out.
And now this, opening a bar.
- Yes, everything's ready.
- Are you mad or half-witted?
- In the name o f Allah! Pack it in.
- Is this place yours?
- No, I work here, I sleep here and
I don't want to see you here please.
- Please don't! You're so unkind.
Don't you understand a thing?
Get out o f my life! I've been fed up
with you ever since you were a kid!
- Show mercy.
- Please Altan
- OK I'll be o ff now, I'll call you.
- Don't call.
- Goodbye. I'll call.
- Don't Altan, farewell.
- I say I'll call you but if you don't
want me to... Wel'll go to Dad's
one day. I'll call you.
Don't call!
Goodmorning Bedriye abla. I just
cut the doorman's throat.
Got any plastic bags?
- Get out o f here!
You're going to die!
- Bumble bee, buzz buzz buzz.
- Go away, Altan.
- Bumble bee, buzz buzz.
- Leave me alone.
- I will not, I'm sleeping.
- Ay la, I found my brother Nuri.
There was a fight, they smashed
my skull in, why don't you look?
Go away. They did a good job,
whoever they were.
Go to the den you've been
idling up to this hour.
Shame on you.
Bumble bee, buzz buzz.
- Altan, will you go to your bed?
- To hell with the duck, to hell,
with the bed. I'm try ing to tell
something but you won't listen.
This is it! Flashy shop, dynamic crew,
business booming. Will you get me
cup o f tea?
- Nuri abi?
- I told you not to come here, didn't I?
- You said don't call, you didn't say
don't come. Get us some tea.
- What's he say ing?
- What do you want from me?
- Nothing big, don't put me o ff.
I've got my job to do, I can't waste
time with you, get lost!
Don't scold me in front o f the kid.
Look, will we do business together?
Still talking about business
- What are you looking at?
- Are you really brothers?
- We are.
- You don't look alike.
- My skeletal structure is more Italian
I'm going, you keep an eye on him.
- You are very funny.
- Honest? I'm not aware o f it,
it's great that you told me.
- Where are you going?
- I'll sleep in my brother's room.
- The boss may come any minute.
- What do I care for your boss?
- Please don't, or I'll be blamed.
Stop babbling, I'll lie down for
two minutes. Go fetch me some tea.
I'm opening the bar
I just need some cash.
- That'll be no problem for you
- Of course it won't, don't laugh.
I've got some goods,
I've got to sell them.
- I've got some goods too.
- What a joke! Do you learn these
jokes from the fish?
I am consulting you.
- What goods are those?
- All from Europe.
- What are they?
- Cream, shampoo, medicine.
- So you robbed a perfumery, eh?
- No, a friend owed me,
he'll pay me if I sell them.
- So he'd sell it himself, if he could?
- Something on those lines
- Don't bother, let him sell them
himself and pay you back.
- We are hurry. Don't you have
friends? He'll accept half the price.
- I don't know that market.
God dammit, you've turned into a fish,
you're no help. Get me some tea.
You're a fraud.
I've crossed your name o ff my book.
- Why, Dad?
- I wanted to, it's my book.
You never call me
- Have pity, I come here twice
a week, each time you complain.
- Don't answer back! You come
empty-handed. You could've brought
chocolates. My mouth's bitter.
- I brought you candy-floss.
- You eat those. You're not ashamed.
- They are delicious, Dad.
- You'll never jump with that stick.
- He jumped, Dad!
- Does it write 'idiot' here?
I'm an idiot, I wouldn't know!
- Why, Dad?
Shut up! Don't answer! You blockhead!
Why'd you bring this? Do you mean
my bum's turned into candy-floss?
I'm better than the whole lot o f you.
You and your good-for-nothing
brother. Sons o f asses!
- I'll have a shave, Nihat.
- Right away.
- After that, work on the hair.
- How do you want it?
- Shape it up, eh?
- I'll trim the top, we'll do something.
- Nihat, trim this part too.
- Don't do it Altan, behave, my boy.
- Give it to me, so you took it?
- After I finish the surgery.
- Behave my boy, or my hand will slip.
- Give it to me, I've been looking
for it for a week.
- What are you looking for?
- I need it, give it to me.
- Alright, take it.
- All you do is play games.
- I've come to talk business.
Don't play with that thing.
You create havoc in my shop.
You're a real miser, fussing
over a bit o f a jelly.
- You were going to run a bar.
- Of course. I came to ask for
suggestions. I've got some
pharmaceuticals. How do I find a buyer
- Did you ask Eczacýbaþý?
- I asked Mickey Mouse, he sends
his greetings to your mom.
- What pharmaceuticals?
Medicines, aspirin. If we sell them
we'll open the bar.
Like the Hodja's sheep.
If we sell them...
Very funny. You'll beg for free
beer when I open the bar.
Walk on. Off with you!
The hell with you!
- Welcome, Rasim Bey.
- Come here Nuri. Where were you?
- I was out delivering, Rasim Bey.
- Why did it take so long?
What were you delivering?
- On the way I dropped by Dad's
place for 5 minutes.
- You should keep your private
a ffairs to your leisure time
- I haven't seen him for a long time.
Have you been here long?
- Yes, 2 hours.
- Did anyone ask for me?
- No.
- Any problems?
- He le ft an hour a fter you.
What's the latest news on the
bar business?
I've got a few bits, drugs, that
sort o f thing. I have to sell them,
I've found a place for the bar.
- What kind o f drugs?
- Nothing big, lotions, aspirin.
- I was scared, I thought you meant
those uppers.
- No, o f course not. But the money
is in that business, I suppose.
- You can't get rich selling aspirin
There was a guy who did
this sort o f thing, he's in jail now.
- What did he sell?
- Don't be so naive.
- Uppers... Where do they sell them?
- You're really into this thing.
No, I'm just curious.
I want to meet those dealers.
- You may get in trouble.
- I'm not a drug addict. Just curious.
Give it to me. I'm leaving these
here. Show it to me.
You said you were curious,
don't mess it up.
Don't you trust me?
- Good evening.
- Yes?
- I wanted to get something.
- How many?
- I'll buy a box.
- Do you have enough cash?
- How much?
- 10 a piece. Box is for 240.
- I'll just buy one.
- Here, o ff with you.
- What's the name?
- Hüsey in.
No, the pill's name?
Are you high or something?
It writes on the back.
Call me if you need to.
- I will, Rasim Bey.
- Hi. Sorry. How are you?
- Who is this young man?
- Altan Çamlý sir, his brother.
- Have you been to Tesvikiye?
- I have, sir
- Tell Rýza to close the accounts.
- OK sir, goodbye.
- I didn't know you had a brother.
I have sir.
Unfortunately I have.
What are you doing?
The boss is magnifique.
- Altan! Farewell, farewell.
- What happened?
The boss is magnifique, so is my job.
I enjoy it and I don't want to see you.
I'm glad for you, I won't come any
more. I've come to fetch you.
- Where to?
- Our place.
- I can't come.
- I told Ay la that I found you,
she said 'Bring your btrother.'
We've got plenty o f food at home.
- I'll be working, I can't come.
- She'll be heart broken.
- I can't come.
- I said you'll break her heart.
He's my brother, sweety, I haven't
seen him for two years.
I'm very impressed. We just have
macaroni, that's all.
Fine then. That's what
we eat, any way.
How are you abi? We kept you
waiting. Tomatoes, you love it.
C'mon Ay la, honey!
No salt? Ay la! We're hungry, eh?
- Don't yell Altan, I'm coming.
- My pretty wife's a great cook!
- What did I cook?
- A little nervous today, are we?
Yes I am. Please don't get me wrong,
but I've had enough o f this marriage.
The decision is yours. Let's hope
for the best, Ay la.
- Sweety.
- Wait a second. You know Altan well.
Six years, and I still don't know him.
- My business is a bit hectic, she
can't keep up with me.
- Business, what business?
Tell me, are you against the bar
project? Tell me frankly.
What bar? It's been years, you're still
talking about it. You brought home
a couple o f shitty stools, that's all.
- You're not supporting your husband.
Support what, are you going to
open the bar with two stools?
- Stools are the main assets o f a bar.
- To hell you will.
He may open, he may close,
he may go bankrupt. Excuse me.
- What happened?
- I'm leaving.
Well done, Ay la.
I'm going with my brother.
- Go to hell!
- Is that your last word?
Did you see how she nags me?
There's no pleasing her!
Women are ungrate ful, in the
end they alway s sulk.
She may be right, actually.
I've done no good to her.
- This is not a decent marriage,
- But I'm near the end. She's making
fun o f my stools. But the truth
lies elsewhere.
- What is the truth?
- I'll open it, you don't listen.
I'd charmed her with just one
bouquet, but it's no use now.
- It's not eas y to be your wife.
- You shouldn't talk like that. We
were in love when we married. She
was hooked on me in the beginning.
You're no stranger, we didn't
get out o f bed for 40 day s.
- Where are you going?
- I don't know. Let's go to Dad's.
- Are you crazy?
- Why? Let's go straight away.
- At this hour?
- We'll say we missed him.
What happened? What
brings you two here?
We missed you Dad. We just dropped
by to see if you need anything.
- Shall I make some tea, Dad?
- No. I had two glasses in the
morning, makes me sick. You know
Ömer. His slimy sons bought him
a house in Ay valik.
- To get rid o f him. His shit would
freeze in Ay valýk.
- What? You didn't even bring me
a bread ring at the kandil feast.
- I brought some Dad, you didn't eat.
Don't interrupt! You shouldn't talk to
your Dad like that. I say you didn't
and you say you did! No one will
notice if I die here. Neighbours bring
food. Strangers strive to help me.
- Don't talk like that, Dad.
I will. I'm cursing my self.
I must be an ass to bring up the
likes o f you. Did I bring you up
to be callous brutes, you animals!
Now you come and bug me.
So you brought me kandil cakes.
Damn you, I don't want your
kandil cakes, o ff with you!
What a fuss over a cake!
I'll go get some in 2 minutes.
- It's too late.
- All right Dad, don't mind him.
I never mind him any way. Where
has he been for two years?
- He was working, Dad.
- I've been working, Dad.
Go on and work then, let me
see you, c'mon.
You've been shitting in our mouth
since we came here.
- Altan!
- What?
- Care ful, you're talking to Dad.
- We don't appreciate him, we're
not worth a shit. I'm disgraced.
- That's enough.
- We're never in favour.
- He got peevish as he got older.
- I've seen his younger day s.
- Get out! I'm better than the
whole lot o f you! Look at them!
- Don't, Dad!
So I get older. Shut up, don't
talk! Don't be rude!
I know what you're worth, too!
You rascal!
- Let's have a drink here.
- You go on, I don't feel like it.
- Come on, we'll relax a bit.
- Let me go Altan, I...
Come on, they're all friends. Come on.
Orhan, this is my brother. Erdo!
See my brother? I'll bring him.
Tevfik! Look, my brother!
- Don't make a big scene.
Don't worry, they're friends.
Suat! How's things!!
- How're you? Where've you been?
- Thanks. My brother.
- Really? It's a great pleasure.
- Not for me.
He's a bit strange, tolerate him.
He's a great joker.
- I don't like it here, let's go.
- We'll have a drink and go.
Tuncay! Look out!
What are we having?
- Nothing!
- You should drink something...
- Tuncay, we have a guest!
- Tuncay, move on.
- Beer! Suits me. Any appetizers?
- I'm leaving.
- Where to?
- I'm going.
Why don't you sit for a while!
Is there a problem?
- That faggot Tuncay spoiled it.
- I'll teach him, don't worry.
- I'll pop by, goodbye.
- Certainly. I found a music
set for your bar
- Man, you're cool.
Tuncay! You're finished
- My greetings to Ay la.
- How's Suat, great kid, eh?
- He's a fraud.
C'mon, you're so strange. Everybody's
a fraud. You think even your
brother's a fraud.
- It's my brother who's the real fraud.
I am not. I may look like one
but I'm not. Suat is great, abi.
God knows, he helped me a lot.
- Leave it, Altan.
He came up with cash, that's how
I got those stools, I swear.
You don't listen.
- Where are you going?
- We're walking.
- I'll go to the o ffice to sleep.
- OK, I'll take you there.
- You can't go there.
- Why?
- It's an o ffice, don't you understand?
- OK, I'll walk with you.
- Don't walk with me, go.
- I'll show you something.
- What'll we see at this hour?
- This is very important for me.
I'll take you to the depot a fterwards.
This is very special. Right here.
- We're there.
- We're where?
- See?
- What?
- This is my bar, don't you see?
- What bar?
Here, look.
- I'm going, don't waste my time.
- Where to?
- Where're you' going to?
- I'll take you...
- Go back to your home
- I've come all this way, come on.
- Altan! Good night to you.
- Good night to you too.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing, I'm not doing anything.
You go on. Lie down and sleep.
- Are you sick?
I'm sick, I live. My heart is...
- Go to your home.
- How can I go, didn't you see.
We had a fight, how can I go back?
I'm not an ass.
Don't be so touchy, Altan.
Get o ff my back.
Who's holding you back?
I'm no better than a street dog.
I'll lie down here.
- C'mon, come here.
If you insist. I'll have to endure the
smell o f medicines for a night.
Please don't get me wrong, it's
only for one night. Never again.
I'm not a beggar. If that's what
you think, I won't stay.
- OK, I'm going to bed.
- Come, I'll massage you.
- Don't be ridiculous, I'm going to bed.
Where will you sleep?
- I'll lie here.
- Allright, goodnight.
- What is this, abi?
- Rasim Bey's locker.
- What's inside, treasure?
You're not touching
anything, are you?
Don't get your hands on anything.
- I'm sleeping.
Fine. Take this pillow.
- Have a nice sleep.
Didn't you sleep yet?
That pill I took that day...
A friend's got the same stuff.
He wants to sell, I'll help him. He
owes me, he'll pay his debt.
'He owes you, he'll pay his debt'
So you've got drugs!
You want to sell them?
Don't get involved in such deals.
Congratulations, that's generous advice
Ay la is going to throw me out.
- What's Ay la got to do with it?
- I've been living in misery, with the
dream o f opening a bar. All I've
is 3 stools, I've become
a laughing stock o f kids. I can't
take it anymore, I need that cash.
Will the problem be over when
you sell your friends' drugs?
Of course it will.
Look, I know a place. We'll go
tonight. But this is the last time
you do this business, OK?
- Right!
Stay in the car, I won't be long.
- What happened?
- I talked to him.
- What does he say?
- There's a guy called Nusret.
He may buy it. He's in Bodrum
- How will we find him?
I have his number. He'll talk to you
if you give Fevzi's name.
- What's the number?
Here, write it on the back o f this.
- 05424251607.
- Starts with 0542?
Thanks. Drop me by a phone booth
Hello... I want to talk to Nusret Bey
I'm Altan, calling from Istanbul.
I got the number from Fevzi.
OK, I'm waiting.
Good evening, abi. Nusret Bey,
I have some drugs, Relaton...
I've got 7 large boxes.
Yes. How much? All o f it?
I'll bring them my self.
Dollars? OK.
I'll leave tomorrow morning,
I'll be in Bodrum in the evening.
I'll get the whole lot, is that right?
I'll call you from this number.
OK Nusret abi. Of course. I'm sorry.
I'll be there tomorrow evening.
Be care ful, he say s. You be care ful,
you silly. The bar is open!
- What's up?
- What?
- Open the door.
- What door?
Won't you take me in?
What is this, like a jail bar?
No, I won't
I'm going to bed, Altan.
You can't set one foot in here.
- I brought ice cream.
Don't you have any pride? I said go,
don't you understand anything?
This is not nice.
Allright then.
- Welcome.
- Wasn't there a queue?
- Not for you.
- Don't drive it far.
- Don't worry
- Park it somewhere sa fe.
The best place.
- He's driving like hell.
- The car is fast, what can he do?
Altan! You stick like a dung fly!
I'll call the cops if you don't leave.
You weren't interested in ice cream,
so I brought you this.
Carrera 4 S.
That's it!
- Hope you didn't steal it!
- What a naughty thing to say.
Dress up, we'll have a ride.
- But I'll drive.
- We'll see.
C'mon, I'm waiting here. Get chic.
Comb your hair. Put on lotion.
I used all my credits to bring
the car here. You think your brother
is good for nothing. Who's ever done
such a favour to his brother?
I'm waiting here, make haste.
Wow! That's it!
- I'm ready. Let's go!
- Right away.
How about that?
It's like a snake!
- It's out o f this world, Altan!
- And you don't let me into that
depot. Trust your brother.
See what I've brought you.
- That's right.
- Chill out, you crazy!
The car's nervous, Altan!
- Let's go to Bodrum for 2 day s.
- Allright.
Damn it! Ask the boss for the car.
You'll drive the Renault. We'll
have a couple o f day s o ff, while
I do a small business.
Right on!
- Let's have some soup.
- What about the car?
Leave it. C'mon, get out.
We'll be back, just lock it.
Aren't you hungry?
Give me the key. You'll spend the
whole night there, if I let you.
Tonight is very special.
For me, as well as for you.
Why are you so stiff?
Get those gloves o ff.
- Great car, eh?
- Amazing!
Know thy brother!
- Where is the car, you idiot!
- What car?
Just a minute, sir.
You filthy lot! You've turned this place
into a pigsty. You mock gangsters!
- With all respects, what pigsty?
- Shut up, don't answer!
- You stole my car in front o f me.
- So you stole the car, eh?
Don't spit on me, you
had a good time in the car.
- Will you tell us where the car is?
- I will, nobody's stolen the car.
Here's the key, in my pocket.
- Shut up, don't lie to me,
you filth! I'll teach you.
- Where did you leave the car?
I'm telling you, wait a second.
The car is over there.
- Where?
- Took the key from you, it's over
there. May I smoke?
- To hell with the smoke!
I took the car from Tolga Bey. He said
put it to the garage. The upper
level was full, I wanted to bring it
down. The patrol stopped us,
I'd no licence, I stopped to drink soup.
- Don't act like an idiot!
- Don't, I'm not hitting you!
- Thie f!
Ask my brother! Let me
take you to the car.
- Where do we go?
- Make a U turn.
- The car is gone!
- I can see that.
- Didn't you park here?
- I said what about the car and
you said let's leave it here!
- You parked it.
There must be another entrance.
Could it be on the other side?
Maybe you parked it on the other
side. Go on, say something.
I swear we parked it right here.
Must be thieves!
- Fantastic, great. Bravo.
- Please...
- Shut up, you!
- Please do I hit you?
- Hilmi.
- Hilmi abi, my brother parked
it here. Say something!
- I don't have a brother called Altan.
Why are you so tense? What're you
doing, my own Dad wouldn't even
even pinch me.
- That's enough!
What are you say ing, you ass-hole!
We won't be kicked around.
Get up, Altan.
Come here, don't run you cowards.
- My foot's broken.
- What happened? Is it bad?
- Cut it out!
- Why! I'm try ing to cheer you up.
- That's enough! Cut it out!
- You're so strange.
- Just when I got things together.
- I came along, your life changed.
Ah, my blind pity! I shouldn't have
let you into the depot.
What will I do in Bodrum?
Why am I going?
- I told you baby.
- Never call me baby!
I told you. You smashed the
guy's face. He must be looking for
you all over Istanbul. They'll find you
Let's get lost for a couple o f
day s, for your own good.
- So we'll run away all our lives.
Not that long. Just for a few
day s. How you hit that guy!
It was like he hit a wall!
- A heavy head-bang weighs 2 tons.
This forehead would survive two
tones, estimate o f the e ffect!
Great!
- What's going on?
- I can't go on, I'm going back.
- What for?
- I've got to go back to my work,
earn my bread, they'll worry.
- You must be crazy, we're on the
road, who'll worry? We'll phone them,
this is just for 2 day s.
You think you're free, but that's not
the point. I've got my work to do.
If they catch you in Istanbul,
you know what they'll do?
They'll pack you so fast you'll be
surprised. Let me drive.
What are you doing? We're going
to Bodrum for two day s.
We'll go to Bodrum for two day s and
everything'll be OK, ha?
- Yes, it will. We'll wander around.
- Shut up, you thie f!
- I've got a small business too.
- Bodrum' Bodrum, what?
So it is Bodrum. I'll make you forgive
me. You'll love Bodrum.
You thie f, you scoundrel!
- I saw it in my dream
- What?
- I've treated Rasim Bey badly.
- Still thinking o f that?
- Shut up! Turn the radio o ff.
- Call him, if it's bothering you.
What will I say? My brother stole
a car, I'm going to Bodrum.
Say 'Our Aunt in Yozgat died.
We're o ff to her funeral.'
Sou you had an aunt in Yozgat,
he'll ask. Any way, I can't lie.
You should.
Stop at a gas station then, let me
make phone a call.
I'm just about to wet my pants.
I'm going to the loo.
Me too.
Fill the tank, I'll pay you when
we get back. I don't have cash,
I'll pay you back in dollars.
- OK, OK, Turkish Liras will do.
- How much did you pay?
- You owe me.
- Did you call Rasim Bey?
- I didn't. But I will.
'It happened so fast Rasim Bey,'
I'll tell him, 'She was full o f life,
but suddenly she died. The ceremonies
will take at least two day s.
- How much for the shirts, 2.5?
- All for the same price.
Altan, where are you?
I was telling you something.
I'm checking the T-shirts. We look
awful. These are great.
The sun is strong here, it's an
alien sun, let's buy a hat.
- Here it is. Great.
- How does it look?
- This is it.
- I'll buy glasses.
Like this?
No, this is for teenagers.
- How about this?
- This is it.
I'll buy a pair too, hold this
Look at me. How is it?
It suits you.
Like a snake. We're game.
My brother will pay. Come on.
- Hello...
- Listen son. OK, listen to me.
That man there. He was talking to
his mug in the loo.
Hello... Nuri abi...
Play something lively.
I don't know how.
How do you do it?
You need the technique. Let me play
you a tune. How is it?
Everyone's gone crazy, this is no
holiday. If we can't find room here,
I'll sleep in Bodrum castle.
I didn't call Rasim Bey.
I'll go back to Istanbul, Altan.
Come on, for god's sake...
Have you got a room?
- Single room?
- It's my brother.
Brother? Yes, o f course.
Lovely brother you've got.
You're lucky, 311. I'll fill the forms.
Call me if you need anything.
I'm tired.
I'm tired o f walking.
You can at least try to enjoy
the place. Come on.
- So many tourists.
- The heart o f the matter is
the tourists. They don't have any
notion o f jealous y. You can approach
girl who's with her man, even kiss
her! He won't mind. Bollocks, that's
what they are!
- You bullock! You're a married man!
You don't know the problem.
Nothing going on for 3 months.
Have pity on me.
- Why is that?
I don't know, she must
have a problem.
- Women don't go for penniless men.
- Really? Is that the problem?
It is. Women don't go for penniless
men. They really look gorgeous.
- Excuse me?
- I said they're gorgeous.
- See what I mean?
- I'm a bachelor, Altan.
Come on, it's here.
Let's go in here for two minutes.
I'll carry out an important project
today. Hang on here for 5 minutes.
Drink something. I'll see a friend
and come back right away.
- What would you have?
- Apricot juice, please.
- Two minutes.
- Don't leave me, Altan.
- Just for 2 minutes.
- Don't be too long.
- Nusret abi, hi, this is Altan.
- What do you want?
- I've brought the stuff.
- What do you want from me?
I just don't know. This is my table,
this is my beer.
- I don't know German.
- Are you Altan?
- I am.
- Nusret abi's waiting for you.
Pardon. I'm very sorry.
He's German!
I'm going with a friend, I'll be back
in half an hour.
What will I do all alone?
You're not alone, there's
lots o f people here.
- I've brought him, Celil abi.
- He's here.
- Hello. I'm Altan.
- Give me the bag.
Bodrum's on fire.
- Nusret bey, it's too hot for...
- Sit down!
Sorry.
Bon apetite.
- You look like a fine boy.
Thanks, I'm an unusual type,
the ladies love it...
Look! I don't even trust my own Dad
in this business. If you do something
wrong, I'll cut your ticket.
- No, I'll try to keep track with you.
- Did you bring the stuff?
- I did, Celil Bey's taken it.
- Is it OK, Celil?
- It is OK, abi.
- Put these into your pocket.
- Don't be o ffended, but I'd like
to count...
- Look, whatever we talk about
stay s here. Never forget that. OK?
Where do I find you?
I'm at Cihangir, Istanbul. Ask for
me at the taxi rank.
- Allright. Get lost.
- I'm leaving then. Bon apetite.
Good evening, Celil Bey.
- Celil! Where is Osman?
- I'll find him right away.
- Harun!
- Yes, yes what?
- Japanese!
- The other day we missed the
Dutch girls because o f you!
- Come on, let's take a shot.
- Forget it man!
- Come on man, What the heck?
- Harun.
- What?
- That man's looking at us.
- Which man?
That man over there. I guess
they're together. We better gat lost.
Yes, You're right. Hello abi.
I don't know how to dance.
Good news, eh, Nusret abi? You've
done a lucky deal.
I don't know how it happened, Osman.
I gave half-price.
- Who is this guy?
- An idiot, never mind.
Get the guy s together and
distribute the stuff.
You'll be rewarded when
this is over.
Thanks, right away.
What's going on?
What a strange man you are.
Operation complete. So you've
got yourself a Japanese.
- Where have you been for two hours
- I'm on business.
- Got yourself a Japanese?
- Chinese.
I'm Altan, brother.
- Naughty brother, naughty.
- I'm leaving, goodbye.
Don't wear yourself out,
I'll knead the rest.
I'm not tired! I'm kneading it
for my personal pleasure.
You think I'd be embarrassed
to ask you, if I were tired?
- No baba, heaven forbid.
- Baba, a call for you.
- Who is it? Tell him I'm bus y.
- Osman, from Bodrum.
Good heavens! Give it to me.
Hello, speak Osman.
Nusret's doing a deal here, I was
alarmed. He got hold o f 5-6 packages
from Istanbul for half the price.
He told me to distribute them,
I wanted you to know.
- Got it. Thanks my boy, we'll find
the source. Don't lose them, probe
into this matter, that's it, my boy.
Hasan! Tell Apo and Suleyman to
search all the depots. They should
check if there's any leak,
that's my orders. Sure thing.
Hello?
Yes?
Bumble bee, buzz buzz buzz. What's
new, Ay la, how are you?
Did I wake you up?
What're you doing?
- I just called to say I love you.
- Enough! Where are you?
I'm here baby, on the job. We'll be
back. I'll start the bar when I get back
But I'm ending this conversation,
Altan, I'm sorry.
Tahir abi. We're checking.
Rasim abi's place.
- Any other place on the list?
- No.
- No boss, we'll check here too.
- Listen Apo, if he's the leak, cut his
ticket this time, OK?
- Got it, boss.
Did you see my brother?
Your brother's taken a room with
someone else.
- Someone else?
- Yes, someone else.
- Why?
- I don't know. Go and ask him. 314.
- Hello brother Altan.
- Hi Altan. Nihao is Chinese for hello.
I heard the noise and wondered
what's going on. What is this?
Don't touch... She knows her job.
Acupuncture. You must try it too.
- Sure it won't do no harm?
- Your sister-in-law's leaving,
try it be fore she goes. Tell you one
more thing. Wo haini. Chinese for
'I love you'.
Fan me, darling.
- Wow, Chinese, eh?
- We don't have much time.
She's leaving.
- Konichiwa sister. Enjoy each other.
- You're really in love with her!
- I said Wo Haini.
- Wow, you already speak Chinese.
- The ship's leaving.
- Wave your hand.
- Shall I?
Look at you. That's enough, she's gone.
OK, I'll send you to China, come on
- To China? How?
- We'll find a way, by ship, by plane...
- What about the bucks?
- I've found a way to get the bucks,
you'll be amazed. I'll open the bar
when we get to Istanbul.
Everything will be great, come,
I swear.
- Turn up the volume.
- What's going on? Lover boy!
He's singing so nice.
Look at those eyes, look at the
beauty. Look at the eyes, Altan.
- Eyes, those are just two lines.
- It's all in those lines.
- I love her, but who?
Look at the lines and they'll tell you!
You're in love!
Yes? It's me. Who are you?
Tahir Baba? With respects, Baba.
My voice is far from your
mind, Nusret. Or did you build your
own empire in that trash hole?
- I'll be damned, I couldn't catch your
voice, Tahir Baba.
- One o f our depots was
robbed, 6-7 packs are gone. Apo and
Suleyman checked it out last night.
If they get through to you, call me.
- B y all means. You'll be told
immediately. Any wrong done to you,
is done to us. With respects Baba.
- Celil!
- I'm here.
Sit down. That faggot who brought
the stuff. He stole it from Tahir Baba.
What does Tahir Baba say?
'Lf he turns up, call me,' he say s.
Let's find him, Celil. If Tahir Baba
finds out, this time he'll kill me
Go out and find that guy, come on!
As o f this moment, brothers Altan
and Nuri start a new life.
Lover boy, are you listening?
- I am.
I'm telling you something, listen.
What are you doing?
I'm eating the melon Chinese sty le.
Listen. One: I'll open the bar.
Two: I'll make it up with Ay la.
Three: I'll make Dad move in with us.
Everything's set.
Don't exaggerate. Hope for the
best. I'm tired o f your plans.
You know nothing, I'm a different
man. I'll save you too.
Let's go Altan, we have
a long way to go.
Wait a minute! ' Tolga Baykal,
the young and handsome star o f
high society beaten up by city thugs.
Son o f a famous transport tycoon,
he threatened the rogues
and said he would take revenge,
on his way to the hospital.'
Now we're done for!
- Who is this Tolga Baykal?
- Who's Tolga Baykal?
What's up, Tolga?
What do you think you're doing?
I'm not shooting, am I?
That guy you hit with your head.
They'll hit us now.
We can't go back. Let's
run away to Greece.
We don't have passports,
don't be ridiculous.
Never mind that. We can stow
away on a tanker, or a ship...
- What about Ay la? Are you nuts?
- We must be sa fe first.
- What about Ay la?
- I'll take Ay la later.
When we get to Istanbul, they'll
catch us in no time. This is plain
to see, I'm telling you.
I had completely forgotten about that
Why are you so quiet?
You hit a stranger with your head!
- All because o f you!
- Shame on you.
You ruined my plans.
I was a happ y man till now.
Don't get smart with me!
You brought all this trouble, you pest!
I make all the plans, I set
everything straight, and now...
It's my plans, my job that's ruined.
And now it's Tolga Bey.
You were happ y an hour ago,
looking at that picture.
- So he le ft. Was anybody with him?
- There was a man. His brother.
- His brother! What's his name?
- Nuri. And a Chinese girl.
- Chinese? What kind o f a gang is this?
- I don't know, Nusret abi.
- Do you know where they went.
- Istanbul, I guess.
Istanbul? C'mon, Celil!
- It's the same car for an hour.
- Who?
- The van, look back.
- Nonsense.
This guy's been on our tail since
we started, I swear.
Nonsense, don't make me nervous,
you're imagining things.
- I'm steeping on it.
- Maybe it's the tycoon?
- Cut it out, don't drive me mad.
- How should I know?
- I've got a headache.
- You're really something.
- Did it make a turn?
- No. How should I know?
Two bloody idiots steal your car,
and give you a nice beating.
You're in the papers. Look!
You've got a big mouth too.
'Son o f the transport tycoon to
take revenge! '. I've been working my
ass o ff for years, and you
play the ma fia. Do you plan to take
a gun and shoot people?
- I said no such thing Dad.
The papers make up stories.
- Should congratulate them for
giving you a good beating.
- Don't talk like that, Dad. We found
the car, the case is over.
Of course it's over, we're already
the talk o f the town.
We're nearly in Istanbul. Maybe
we shouldn't enter the city.
- I don't know.
- What do you mean I don't know?
Tolga's men must be a fter us.
The cops must be a fter us too.
We're already there.
What are we to do?
- I don't know, Altan.
- Why do you talk like that?
You can at least say something
I'd pere fer not to go.
I don't know, Altan.
There's Tolga, there's the cops,
and others too. They'll all be a fter us.
We shouldn't even be here.
What will we do?
- Shall we go to Dad's?
- What will we do there?
We'll hide. No one knows about us.
Does anybody from the depot
know Dad's house? No.
- I didn't call the depot.
- Let's spend the night at Dad's.
- I don't know, I don't know.
It's more or less sa fe. We stay
there you make your calls.
Then we all go our way s.
We'll make a plan, OK?
- What are these shoes for? Guests?
- These are ladies' shoes. Looks like
Dad's having a party.
- We'll find out.
What's going on, Akif abi?
My condolences.
We buried the deceased today.
The one with the blue shirt, his son,
used to come and upset him.
Didn't you hear about it?
He raved about you a lot.
- My condolences.
Oh my poor Dad! So he's gone!
- What are you doing?
- Just looking.
- Don't be sad.
- My Dad's dead!
Altan! This's how it is.
Don't cry, don't be upset.
How can my father die?
People are born, and then they die.
That's how it is.
Don't cry, don't be sad.
How can my dad die?
It's all right.
Come on, Altan.
- What's happened to this place?
- Doesn't make sense.
Look, I'm scared, we better get going
What on earth! You!
- Nuri abi, where've you been?
- Serkan, what's going on?
- Nothing. We're packing up.
- Why, are we moving the depot
to some other place?
- You're not aware o f anything.
- What are you talking about?
- Didn't you hear about the boss?
- He's mad at me, isn't he?
- No, he died.
- What?
I swear. He killed himself.
Come on, let's get away
be fore it's our turn.
What luck, we get back and
everyone's dead.
Why did he kill himself?
Oh, my dear dad, he's gone too.
We're in a shambles. We had a fight
the last time we saw him.
Come on in.
- Isn't Ay la home?
- Must be sleeping. Have a seat.
What's going on, Altan? Looks like
you've found the way home.
Welcome Nuri abi
- How are you Ay la?
- Dad's dead.
- Have you only just heard?
You must be really sad.
- Of course I'm sad.
- Where have you been?
- I was on a business.
- What is that package, Altan?
- You think we went to Bodrum
for acupuncture treatment.
We were there for business.
This money is ours, Ay la.
Where did you get that money?
Did you steal it or something?
What do you mean 'steal it!?
I did a deal. I'm opening the bar.
- That money must be fake.
- For god's sake. We're opening
the bar. You don't listen.
- Forget the bar. We'll give this
money to Tolga.
- Sorry?
We'll give it to that guy Tolga.
To compensate for the car, and
the whole matter will be closed.
- Are you nuts? I've toiled so much
for this, I'll open the bar.
- Enough is enough! You're obsessed
with this bar! They are a fter us,
they'll kill us, don't you see?
Get me something to wear.
I'm stinking.
Will a shirt do?
Let's hand them the money and
get it over with.
You work your ass o ff, and hand
it all to a stranger.
Let's find another way.
- Altan, where've you been?
What's up Haluk? How are you doing?
Hang on a minute.
- Where've you been?
- I've been working.
- What's up with that deal?
- What deal?
You were talking about drugs. Hope
you didn't get into a mess.
- Why should I?
- Two guy s were looking for you.
- Two guy s? Who were they?
- They asked the guy s here.
- Damn it!
- What is it?
It's alright, nothing. B ye.
- They're looking for us.
- I told you, let's hand them the
money right away. Heed my words.
- Where shall we take it?
To the hospital. I messed up his
face big time.
- How come you don't know them?
- I swear I don't know. I never saw
anyone called Altan.
- Don't drive me crazy. He gave
your name be fore talking to me.
- Must have heard it somewhere,
I swear I didn't see him.
- That asshope...
- Perhaps he used a false name.
- Let's go.
I'll find that bastard even if
he wears a false face.
- Let me carry the money, Altan.
- I've got it, allright.
- Let me carry it.
- You're obsessed with money.
- You're sure it's this hospital?
- This is the one the papers wrote.
Hello ma'am.
We wish to see Tolga Bey.
- Sorry?
- Tolga Baykal, we'll visit him.
- Tolga Bey's discharged, sir.
- Is he? How come?
He le ft the hospital
yesterday morning.
He should be in a coma,
we have to see him
- Who are you?
- It's allright ma'am.
C'mon Altan. He's discharged.
- What will we do now?
- We'll phone.
- To whom?
- Tolga.
- How will we find his number?
- From the directory, there's a taxi
rank here, come on.
Call for you, sir.
Yes?
Greetings sir, sorry for interrupting.
We want correct a mistake.
I've got great news. Something's
happened, whaever happened is
not like what you think it is.
We want to re fund the cost o f that
stolen car. Let's put an end to
this unpleasant situation.
Get o ff my son's back. We've no time
waste with the likes o f you.
Don't call again, if you don't
want to get into more trouble.
Why are you yelling!
Thanks, man.
- He hang up on me.
- What does he say?
'Get o ff my son's back,' he say s.
Must be crazy.
- Didn't you say we'll pay?
- I did.
- How did he answer?
- Bug o ff, he said.
Never mind, he won't have the
money. Suits me. We have the money
to ourselves. Let's go.
We worried for nothing. Those
guy s had nothing to do with us.
- I'm feeling low.
- Let's have a couple o f beers and
go home. Hi Tuncay. Two beers.
- Is that money ours now?
- Ours? Whose was it, any way?
- Let's have a tombstone
made for Dad.
- OK, let's order a really good one.
- Altan, how's things?
- We're doing OK.
You brothers are a team now,
you can't stay apart, eh?
- We lost Dad, Suat.
- Really? I didn't know. I'm sorry.
- Dad's gone, the boss's gone.
- My brother's boss killed himself.
What a pity...
Some guy s asked for you today.
- Oh no! Must be Tolga's men.
- Are they lunatics? Maybe their
minds are confused.
- Yeah, I've got it. I made a call and
straightened things out.
- Altan, how're you my man!
- Nusret! What brings you to Istanbul?
- We've come to see you.
- See me? That's great.
- Who are these guy s?
Nusret, from Bodrum.
Let me introduce you; my brother,
and my best friend Suat.
- I am honoured, sir.
- Why don't you sit?
- We're in a hurry.
Came to pick you up.
- All's well, I hope?
- All's well. We'll chat somewhere else.
- You're my guests. Tuncay!
Give us some fruits on flames,
or something!
Don't worry. We've prepared
something with flames for you.
Suat! Call Ay la, tell her I won't be
home tonight.
- Whose stuff are you selling?
- What'd I do to you, Nusret abi?
- Gasoline!
- You stole the boss' stuff
and sold it to me!
- What boss?
Shut up, you scum!
Those drugs belonged to Tahir Baba.
I don't know him, please be
so good as to...
Shut up! You've got me into
trouble for nothing.
- What drugs Altan?
- Just a moment.
I'm telling something, wait a second.
I swear I don't know Tahir.
I got those drugs from a depot.
- Which depot, Altan?
- Just a minute, I'm try ing to explain
- So you robbed the depot!
- Why are you hitting me?
- How could you do that?
How could you rob me?
You robbed the depot, you stole the
car, what kind o f man are you?
- What car, shut up!
Just a second, Nusret abi, this is
between us, listen...
You're not a man. You're an
animal in disguise.
You don't know the whole story,
hold your tongue for once.
- Celil! Pour the gasoline!
- Thie f!
Please don't, abi. I've never
seen anything like this.
Altan, you burned yourself,
now you're burning me.
- Be silent, for god's sake.
- Haven't you finished, Celil?
- They should be thoroughly soaked
- How can you burn a man
with gasoline?
- Where's the money?
Who could this be, right
in the middle o f a job?
Hello? Tahir Baba? How're you?
Business as usual. I'm in Bodrum.
- Cut it out!
- Tahir Baba!
So you're in Bodrum. I'll bury you
in Bodrum, you asshole!
Who're you?
- We're running a bar!
Get the hell out o f here! Get out!
- Who are these men?
- How should I know?
These guy s have become a nightmare.
- All because o f you.
- Because o f me?
- Of course.
- Am I to be blamed for the ma fia?
- Yes, you are!
So I am. Yo could say the
same for the Chinese girl.
Don't talk like that.
She's not any girl.
And I'm not any guy either.
I'm your brother.
Unfortunately you are, sad,
But it's true.
What? You should be ashamed. You'd
never drive that car, if not for me.
- Shouldn't I have done it?
- That's what you are.
Shouldn't I, shouldn't we.
You're a prune!
Your Dad's a prune! God forsake me
for calling him names.
You killed Dad any way.
- I killed Dad!
- Of course!
- Shame on you!
Gasoline! It caught fire!
How can I have done that.
How can you behave like that?
- Forget Dad, it's burning.
- My money's burning!
- Don't go near, it's gasoline!
- My money's burning!
Don't touch it, don't go near.
- The money's inside, it's burning.
- Don't touch it!
At least we're alive.
That's something too.
- Never mind.
- Allright, I'm sorry. Stop brooding.
You alway s say you're sorry,
but you do it any way.
You do it, then say you're sorry.
Alway s happens that way.
That money wouldn't be enough
to open a bar, any way.
- Why?
- That money was ill-gotten.
- It wouldn't do us any good.
- Well done! So you've learned
to tell good from rotten.
- I would never do this kind o f thing
if I were alonel did it for Ay la.
I love her. I swear to God I do.
Looks like no car will stop here.

Women love flowers.

- How could you do such a thing!
Don't, Altan!

What did I do to you, Ay la?
How could you do this to me?
You're dead, you're both dead!
God's curse be upon you.
You're dead! What did I do to you?
Just think; you come home,
and face such a scene.
There's nothing you can do. You might
say: Ay la wouldn't do such a thing.
She would, or she wouldn't, you
never know. Life's like that.
