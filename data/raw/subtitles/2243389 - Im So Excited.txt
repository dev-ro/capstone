Everything that happens in this movie
is fiction and fantasy
and has nothing to do with reality.
I'M SO EXCITED!
Oh my God! I'm sorry! Are you okay?
Are you okay?
The suitcases fell while I
was avoiding him.
Where's my phone?
What are you doing with the phone
in the middle of the track?
You're out of your mind! Get lost.
- Are you OK, Jessi?
- I feel sick.
You are pale.
Everything makes me sick.
You haven't told me anything.
Maybe you're pregnant!
Jessi,
is it true?
It's still early.
I'm two months pregnant!
2 months?
And never said anything?
- It's doctor's fault.
- How is it the doctor's fault?
He asked me if I want to keep the baby.
I want it very much.
"We tried for years",
I told him.
"Don't tell him yet, it's early," he said.
I said, "My husband will notice."
Did you notice?
I noticed that your boobs are bigger.
And the eggs I eat in the morning?
It's true you eat a lot of eggs.
Can I go to the infirmary
before bleeding out?
Let's go to the infirmary to show you.
Stay here tweeting
and put the suitcases on the cart.
I'm bleeding...
live.
Taxiing.
Peninsula 2549, ready to roll.
Peninsula in 2549.
Authorization to roll.
Cleared to taxi to the holding point.
Free on the right.
Also on the left.
Let's go.
Good evening, Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Joserra Belasategui speaking,
chief steward of the flight 2549
of Peninsula airline
with the destination of Mexico City.
Your attention, please.
We'll begin with the
security instructions.
There are 8 exit doors,
four on each side of the plane.
Each bears the inscription EXIT.
At the lower side of the seats
or on the floor in the corridors,
there are some lights on
Emergency,
marking evacuation routes.
All emergency exits,
including the windows on the wings,
have an inflatable evacuation
slide.
Life jackets are
under each seat,
but don't remove them
unless it's necessary.
Each life jacket is
in a bag.
To take it out,
Pull the red waist band on the front
Pull down to open the bag
as indicated,
once opened, vest will be thrown out
extending it.
To wear it, stick your head
through the opening,
past the strip behind the belt
and fasten the extremities,
pulling to tighten it.
To inflate,
Pull the red handle.
You can also inflate by
blowing into the tube.
Do not inflate the vest
inside the plane.
Ulloa,
stop it.
I dropped it. The habit...
Norma doesn't stop looking, isn't it?
Amusing herself
I don't like her. You go.
I can't, I have pray.
What do you need for!
For me, a lot! And for you too!
For me?
What would have been your life
if I had not prayed for you?
And what did you prayed for?
To quit drugs, alcohol
and dark room.
The joys of life!
You could have asked
to find a good husband!
I did that too,
but with your character...
Why don't you pray for me too, Fajas?
You don't need to, you don't have problems.
You think so?
You stopped drinking...
you have a husband who loves you.
You smell like tequila!
Na! Only a sip.
Joserra, not today, for God's sake!
I'll try, Alex.
What about the passengers?
Norma doesn't stop looking.
She's mad because she can not see a movie
nor make a call.
Explain me what is the fault.
I do not know how.
I figured! I'm avoiding them,
as they say.
If they ask, invent something.
I can't.
You know I can't lie.
Tell a story?
Don't give details.
Stun them with something technical.
For me anything technical
is a form of lie.
- You're a pain in the ass.
- Do not start!
Should I tell them the story of the Covenant?
OK.
The important thing is that they are
entertained and distracted.
You're better than anyone at that,
without technicalities.
Entertain them as you know.
Today I don't know...
What do you want to drink?
Wine.
Tea. And you stop drinking.
Shut up!
Have you talked again
with the control tower?
Any news?
You better don't know.
What about the track?
Still no news.
Wine and tea.
- And stop drinking!
- Shut up!
Miss, you can not be here.
Is something wrong?
No, but please, get out.
Everybody is sleeping at economy class.
The flight attendants have given them muscle relaxant,
against the economy class syndrome
so they all sleep now.
Even the hostesses are cooked.
They are exhausted, poor them.
If you need anything, my colleagues
are happy to assist you.
I'm sensitive ...
I have powers
What ... what do you mean?
Perceive things
that others do not perceive.
And today I feel it will be
a very special day for everyone.
But what do you feel exactly?
Last night I dreamed
that my life would change
and this morning... I knew it.
Do not ask me how... but I knew it.
(NERVOUS) You knew what?
Something big will happen
On this trip
that will affect us all.
Couldn't you say that before boarding?
I am often taken for crazy!
Unless the thing is very evident
and is very safe,
I never say anything.
What have you felt exactly?
Just woke up ...
and felt that ... today
I will be no longer a virgin.
Are you still a virgin?
Yes... When men hear
I have powers that get mad.
And I start shouting ...
but nothing!
Apart from that,
Have you felt something else?
I am viewing ...
I'm looking for sensations ...
Yes. I'm feeling.
I feel!
that we arrive to a place ...
white!
As a cloud.
A place where we all are better ...
and there is no lie.
Bullshit!
I have also seen human blood.
Blood?
Will someone die?
No... I did not say that.
But there will be blood!
I'm going to take your drinks,
I had forgotten.
Joserra, bring tequila instead of wine.
Good idea, tequila.
Fajas... a tea.
Norma want to complain officially.
- I wrote down.
- I told you.
If she wants letter paper,
say that with a sheet we clean our ass.
And you are absolutely right!
Another thing I would say ...
The groom. Every time he sees me
he winks at me.
- But he was not asleep?
- At the beginning, yes
When I pass near by, I feel
he opens one eye, and winks.
That it is something extraordinary.
Extraordinary is what I have in the cabin.
A crazy woman entered and
she says she is seeing
and contacted the afterlife
through Alex and Benito
and says that during this trip
something big is going to happen
that affect us all.
This is mine.
Poof, something big
that will affect us all!
Ii is mine that is going to be something big
that will affect us all.
It's hot.
Very? Do you think so?
Poof, not the Bridegroom! The water!
The water!
And when did you guess?
From childhood.
I see things, feel things ...
Since I was very little
What about you?
I can not complain.
Working in my village and outside, abroad.
I go to Mexico to work.
To do what?
My specialty are dead people.
The dead?
I feel the death.
I notice it.
You notice it here?
In the cabin?
I already feel sick.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, not here.
Well let's celebrate!
Stop drinking, Joserra!
I'll stop.
And what are you going to do in Mexico?
Some Spaniards are missing,
their families believe
that they have been murdered.
And I have to find them.
How?
I know where they have been seen alive
for the last time.
You mean, you're a private detective?
Detective-Detective, no.
To give you an idea,
I am a kind of divine rod.
Only instead of finding out where water is
I find where the deads are.
Crazy!
I'm going to look for the bodies.
Are you going alone?
I will get help from drug traffickers,
close friends of the victims.
Do you know where you're going?
I have a little 'fear.
I heard that in Mexico
there's so much violence,
but they pay me well!
I talked on the phone
with friends of the Spaniards.
With the drug traffickers?
They seem nice.
I see them in Guadalajara,
seems to be beautiful.
They swore
to accompany me everywhere,
I will never be left alone.
I think I can trust them.
Do you open?
Maybe they leave.
I don't think so.
Well, maybe they get tired.
I don't think so.
I'm opening. Act normal.
Hide the tequila!
Is there a problem?
What's going on?
Are you hiding something from us?
I'm sorry you can not see a movie,
nor make a call.
The steward did not tell you
you can use the public phone in case of emergency?
(DROWNING) Breathe through your nose, you fagot!
Yes, I'm queer. So?
And the two hostesses too. So?
- You wanted to know?
- Breathe!
What about the pilots?
The pilots?
Are they also fags?
He is bisexual, he's with me.
Shut up! Are you crazy?
Well, sorry ...
Excuse me, first of all this is
confidential information, huh?
The commander Acero is married with
two sons, aged 11 and 13 years.
A very difficult age, as you know,
for their father to go out
of the closet, do you understand me?
What about the other?
Who? Benito Moron?
No, I'm straight,
and unfortunately married.
I want to separate of her for years
but I can't.
I thought I'd make her believe
I'm with a man
because that's all she could not stand
but I do not like men.
How do you know? Have you tried them?
No. But...
since we are in confidence,
I once sucked a cock,
to rule out the possibility.
I... I have no prejudices,
I have a lot of gay friends.
But I got a sick ...
almost like taking heroin.
Have you thought about killing her?
-- Whom?
-- Your wife.
In South America we don't resolve everything by
killing.
Only in extreme situations. And we are not
South Americans, we are Mexicans.
Life has no value there!
No, people pay millions
for their life.
Enough talking.
What I want to know ...
We all want to know ...
but you have to get out of the cabin.
Passengers are forbidden to enter,
especially in the group.
Nor do the stewards
drink alcohol.
You are right.
The "hand"! The "hand"!
I hate being touched!
Still eating?
I'm sorry, I wanted to entertain them.
Talking about my private life?
It was the first thing that came
to my head and it worked!
You are unheard of, Joserra!
Like I said, I am sorry.
I warned you not to drink!
Alex, I'm sorry.
As the French say, "Je suis désolé".
I do not know if ... I understand.
Speaking of Frenchmen.
Rather, the French!
You don't have anything to say to me?
Who, me?
- About what?
- About her!
Let's not talk at feminine, okay?
You shut up, experimental sucker! You sucked your
colleague boyfriend's cock.
I was drunk, he had to prove myself.
- Better do it with someone you trust.
- And with a good dick!
Well, enough, Joserra!
Passez!
No, not another one, no.
Please, you can not stay here.
I'm a pilot too, I can help you.
No, thank you very much,
I don't think it's necessary.
We have a problem.
With Guadiana Bank?
No, I mean with the landing gear.
I did not ask earlier
not to alarm anyone.
Have you talked with the Control Center?
[Music, beat]
Needless to say,
but it tastes better.
The blow is your thing.
To face these beasts,
I have to drink with exaggeration.
When you do the hero, you scare me, Joserro.
Want some?
(ACCENT ARGENTINE) Can you sign here, please?
(MEXICAN ACCENT) I sign anywhere, I do not think it matters.
Thank you. I'll take care of that.
Have we met?
No. Well, I know who you are but,
no, we've never met.
Say 'you',
we are the same age.
In Marbella, perhaps?
I don't know Marbella.
Your face seems familiar.
I must have a common face,
it happens to me often.
Alba!
What is it?
A letter of complaint.
For what?
I will explain later, sign please.
Sign, if you do not mind.
Once arrived in Mexico, we will denounce
the Peninsula and all of you,
including the flight attendants
at Economy-class!
I tried to get served
but they all sleep like babies!
The passengers too, they are under drugs.
The pilot said that they took
a muscle relaxant.
You must be retarded, right?
When we arrive in Mexico
you'll all be in trouble.
(TIPSY) We may never land in Mexico.
Right now we are going around the Toledo area...
Toledo, Ohio?
Toledo, Castilla La Mancha.
Are you kidding me?
What do you mean?
Landing gear does not work,
so we have to make an emergency landing.
It's very dangerous,
they need to prepare the track
in a special mode ...
In short, a mess.
Why they do not prepare it?
What are they waiting for?
To find a free airport.
- We don't have a track.
- And Barajas?
Not possible.
Airspace is blocked by
the UN summit held in Madrid.
And we need an empty track.
What do we do?
For now, sticking around.
What about the landing gear?
Why does not work?
The pilots have told me not
to tell because people will panic.
One of the 4 wheels is blocked.
The pilots tried.
Why we do not descend?
At the airport they forgot
to remove the wheel locks,
damaging the truck.
Sure, now I get it ...
Do not worry, our captain
is an expert in emergencies.
With wife and children and a boyfriend
and a lover, you'd better!
If you meant Benito, he's not his lover.
He sweared that it was just a blowjob!
It's already happened?
There have been other cases?
I do not know ...
you never know with a bisexual ...
I mean if you know another case
when the landing gear did not work.
Oh, that!
Yes It has happened before.
In Gerona, a short while ago ...
And how did it end?
The plane broke into three parts
but only two people dead.
This is an attack!
They want to kill me!
They want me out!
Do not worry!
Maybe nothing will happen.
They're after me!
They want me out!
They try me ...
Excuse me.
They are the secret services of CNI!
They want to get rid of me!
This has nothing to do!
How do you know? You know everything!
Maybe... But I have contacts
in the CNI and know how they work.
I also know how it works!
They want to get rid of me!
(PANTS) Quiet, please!
Do not look at me like ...
Clean this.
We keep our nerve!
A few years ago, a passenger had
a harsh panic attack
and wanted to enter the cabin.
In Business-Class executives were
totally paranoid,
had mistaken him for a terrorist.
The three of us were trying to convince
the man to sit down.
And I went inside and prepared
an injection to sedate.
But
when I returned, it was too late.
executives have had him immobilized
and suffocated with a pillow.
Was in the same plane?
Yes, an Airbus 340.
But it was exactly this one?
How do I know!
What happened then?
We simulated a natural death.
It was decided to make a pact of silence,
which I'm betraying at this time,
because I have not done it with my heart.
The press said
it was a heart attack.
All this has caused me such a trauma
that since then I can not lie.
And the pilots did not tell me,
because I am telling everything.
I had read the news,
I did not believe, it seemed strange.
And how!
We have to stay calm.
We will do our best
to make your trip enjoyable,
do not ask me how.
I promise you I'll try not to drink another drop of alcohol.
We have a repertoire of musical numbers
that if you want,
we can sing.
He always gets like this, poor guy!
I pass the list of songs ...
perhaps it's not the best time ...
but maybe we forget.
I'm going to pray for everyone.
The gentlemen want something to drink?
What can I serve you?
Whiskey.
Two.
I should make a call ...
A blow job?
A phone call.
Armrest phones do not work.
What about the public phone?
It's only for emergency calls.
Mine is urgent.
I have to go to a friend's house
in Madrid to take something.
In Madrid?
We are suppose to fly to Mexico.
How you planned to stay in Madrid
if we go to Mexico?
Ulloa! What do you care!
I lied.
God!
But, under the circumstances,
I'd feel better if I call.
You can the answer in hands free,
does it matter?
An old fault. The "speaker"
is broken otherwise it's okay.
Can I have a gin tonic?
Sure, man
Hello. It's me, Ricardo.
It--is--wait, wait
a minute, wait.
Is this a bad time?
No, no, not at all! No, by God!
It's just that I was only ...
Are you okay?
I feel you're agitated.
No, no, no, for nad...
No! Ricardo!
(MOBILE) I hear you very bad!
Alba!
What happens, what do you do?
Alba, do not make anything crazy!
What? I'm not Alba.
(MOBILE) What happened here?
I do not know. I passed under a bridge,
and a cell phone dropped into my basket.
(MOBILE) Something else dropped?
No... what?
A woman's body.
What are you saying?
Who are you?
My name is Ricardo Galan.
Ricardo?
Ricardo, is this you?
I did not recognize you!
(MOBILE) Ruti! Ruti, me neither!
Is this fucking phone.
Listen, I'm on a plane.
What a joy to hear you!
You threw the phone?
But no, imagine! I'm on the plane.
Listen to me a moment.
No. I heard you enough for three years!
This time is different, Ruti.
I'm in an extreme situation.
(SPEAKER) You're always so,
and I've always believed you.
But it's over.
Remember, it's been over for 247 days.
I remember, Ruth
The phone you speak on now is that of Alba.
I was talking to her a minute ago then
probably the phone slipped of her hand.
I had to have exactly the phone of that bitch...
She was about to jump off the bridge
when you passed under.
I know I'm not in the position
to ask anything,
but could you please come back and check
that nothing has happened?
Alba is mentally ill.
I will go back, do not hang up.
I'm under the bridge and I do not see anything unusual,
so you can travel calm, Ricardo.
And now I will leave the phone on the ground,
as if I had not passed below the bridge
Call her again!
If I were Ruth, I would be waiting for you to call.
I will not answer.
You're not part of my life anymore.
The Ruth you knew no longer exists.
She disappeared with you.
Wait, give me the Cartier.
In the hospital you are not allowed
with sharp objects.
No.
What are you starring at?
Please, get in the car, miss.
I call you and you tell me.
You're not coming with us?
- Do I have to go?
- It would be better...
I had a cocktail and now I don't feel well.
You better come with us, please.
What a pity!
Oops! Are you hurt?
The dove. She thrown it out of the window.
I was picking up things
and she just hit me in the head.
The bird, it must have had a nice peck.
Yes.
Give me the jersey!
Come ...
It's not the first time that she attacks me.
I do not know how her mother let her live alone here,
she often escaped
from the psychiatric hospital.
But you saw her mother,
She is more concerned by what happens to Dior
then what happens to the daughter.
Mr. Galan did not want to leave her alone,
but even ...
Mr. Galan?
Yes, the actor, the heartthrob, Ricardo Galan ...
He was her boyfriend.
They broke up months ago.
I have not seen him here recently.
In short, he came ... to take
the things she had stolen.
Personal things that she did not want to return.
All the stuff thrown on the street belongs to him.
The cashmere jersey ...
very good, terrific.
The bird, memories of a beautiful evening, for sure.
He came here and made some scenes ...
And how do you know all this?
He told me, he knows that I do not like the gossip
and I admire him very much,
She confessed to me, poor thing.
You noticed how thick she was
She lost weight, because of worries,
not by excesses, as the press said.
I'm not surprised
he fled to Mexico.
He must be in the airplane now.
He found work in a movie fiction.
By the way, who are you?
I'm an old friend of Ricardo.
I should take his things.
There are up.
You wanna go up or should I bring them down?
- I accompany you.
- Better.
She is a painter. You can see that...
Half an hour ago she ran like crazy.
She doesn't recognized me anymore.
She started throwing things of Mr. Galán out the window.
I called the hospital and her mother,
to take her elsewhere.
I really do not understand it,
how can she leave her daughter alone
in these conditions.
I remember when I showed her the house.
Miss Alba was right there,
near the window.
She told me that she is down.
She likes to live close to the edge.
Then I did not understand what she meant.
So you've come for the bag?
I'll help you
You really do not have anything to say to me?
It is not a shame to have an affair
with Mr. Galan.
She was not the only one
Ruti, is that you?
(MOBILE) Glad to hear you again.
Any news about Alba?
An ambulance came and took her.
They admitted her in the hospital?
Well, it's better.
Are you drinking?
Yes... Well, we're all drinking
Alba was ready to jump from off the bridge
and you drink to celebrate?
How could you celebrate?
What happens is that no...
No, I am not telling you because ...
(BOTH) Don't tell!
Tell me!
They told me
not to say anything.
But I'm going to say!
You're stewardess, you will understand much better than me.
Former stewardess.
Former stewardess, honey.
The landing gear does not work.
We fly aimlessly
and still do not know
where or how we're going to land.
We are stuck.
How can you joke about this?
No kidding! I have no idea
what the locks are!
It's the first time I hear about them!
Enough is enough!
I'm not lying.
Believe me, at least this time.
Maybe this is my last call.
Everything right?
One time I tell the truth and
she does not believe me.
You lied a lot, right?
A lot.
I'm taking an anxiolytic,
an antidepressant and a sleeping pill.
With or without alcohol?
I finish this first.
Please do not wake me up until we land.
Do not worry.
Our leader, the most outrageous,
has only a catharsis per trip.
I once had two
Two.
- I feel sick!
- Have another chamomile tea.
- Chamomile does not help.
- Better this way.
Take this, you will feel better.
What is it?
Peppermint and anise,
these are calming.
I made it myself at home
Give it to me.
Take it.
Who would think to talk with your boyfriend
on a day like this?
- Do you need me?
- No, for the moment.
You're afraid. Go away.
Me? No!
After the thing with Benito, no.
I made myself a fool in front of everyone.
It was just a blowjob, they were drunk.
Between drunken men is normal, dear.
In the Army they teach you those things.
Even me, as fat as a pig,
they sucked me entirely!
It's Tere.
Oh, hello! Tere, nice, tell me.
You picked up the clothes.
Yes, the clothes. Keep them. The sweaters.
The sweaters ... this season
they are all "vintage".
(SPEAKER) I cant hear you, Tere.
Hide all! Do you know where.
Is something wrong?
Do not scream. It's an attack, I think.
- I can't hear you.
- I can't speak louder.
- An attack? Against who?
- Against me! Whom else?
Oh my God!
Hey, can you stop listening, please?
Hey, I'm listening, Tere.
It's a private conversation
I'm alone.
Everybody listened to me but who cares!
It was humiliating enough.
Humiliating?
Call the Minister!
I hear you bad.
- I call the minister and what do I do?
- Threaten him!
I can't hear.
I missed the last 2 sylabs...
Speak louder, he can't hear you.
- Threaten him, damn it!
- Okay.
- With what you know
- With what I know.
So what do I know?
Tere...
Maria Teresa!
Peninsula 2549, we continue to try to find
an alternative landing track.
So far we have not found anything.
But how is that possible?
We are following the procedure.
Give me an estimation?
I do not know.
But sooner or later we will
find a free landing track.
What is the status of
Airport of La Mancha?
Indignation.
Apparently the funding has been a huge scam.
This evening they do not talk about something else.
Okay, but the airport is active?
I don't know. I will inform myself.
Mr. Mas is the president of Guadiana Bank,
they financed the project..
What do you say?
They hide in the bushes now.
It's my daughter.
What do you think of her?
She's very cute.
You know her?
Me? How would I?
She is also an artist.
Ya...
She left us two years ago.
We have not heard from her ever since.
Looking, through other people,
we learned that she was working as
"dominatrix".
I haven't said anything to her mother.
She is ultra catholic, imagine ...
Do not trust what people say.
She had the best education,
but. .. we have had to do something wrong.
Sure.
But what?
You're asking me?
Not a single call in two years.
You are also ultra Catholic?
I'm not ultra anything.
I'm just a businessman ...
who would like to be able to tell
his daughter that her mother has changed,
and dies literally
to talk to her.
I fell asleep.
A lot of people are sleeping on this flight!
Where are we?
Above Toledo area!
We are flying around.
When we land,
maybe the plane will break,
or explode,
that is another thing.
Hey, sorry ...
The groom is awake and want to know.
Go out and say something!
Me?
Not you, silly!
We are preparing Agua de Valencia.
Agua di Valencia, what a great idea!
What is it?
She told me...
that we are still at a Toledo
and that we will explode.
Please don't exagerate!
We have some problems...
Some serious problems, really..
And we're drinking to forget.
I don't! I have given up alcohol.
Agua di Valencia is for the passengers.
And for us!
For them too, I'm afraid.
Too bad we do not have mescaline
to add.
I thought about it! But in the end I brought
only heroin, cocaine and pills.
Where was my head at!
The mescaline was retired in '86 ...
It's being manufactured at Valencia again.
I have a 'pusher' friend
who sells it in Madrid.
One second.
Oh, what a shame ... ay!
Too bad you do did not buy!
But I am against drugs!
The mescaline is different.
People become communicative and kind.
Imagine what it would do to them!
The ones here too ...
They wouldn't need entertainment,
I think
Hey, you have a song request?
No, imagine!
Musicals have killed the authentic cabaret!
I have some mescaline.
- For the honeymoon.
- It's your honeymoon?
Give me the scissors.
- Scissors!
- Give me those!
Wait, you have to agitate it well,
you have to do it right.
What a politoxicoman I am!
It smells a bit, no?
I've washed as best as I could ...
I had it in my ass.
I do not care.
Me neither. Also, I'm not going to drink.
Why did I promise?
The tablets should not stink.
I have ...
them packed well
before putting there.
I was "mule" many years.
To cross the border
the ass is safe.
I also believe very much about the ass.
It's true. No smell almost, look..
It stinks!
Thanks.
Hey girls, let's do
a collection to pay him.
- We won't pay with cash.
- We will pay, stingy!
Okay, okay, whatever you want,
but tell me ...
Sure. I finish and I'll tell you.
More or less, counting on the delay,
What time we'll get to Mexico?
One moment...
I'm starting to realize
and I regret.
-- Well, do not think!
-- Sure!
Sure. You are immoral,
you have no problems.
But I warned you ...
if they ask me, I'll have to say.
How much you like the 'mea culpa'!
What about the pilots?
We do not give anything to the pilots.
It would do them good to relax a little.
The girl is right?
Warn them it has mescaline.
Tell Alex that I did not take anything
and I feel sick.
How late we arrive in Mexico?
We don't land in Mexico.
Do not tell me that with the hangover
we are in the wrong plane.
Listen...
We just got married,
and we celebrated 3 days
and we have come directly here.
The hangover has nothing to do.
This was suppose to go to Mexico.
And now it does not?
No. Drink a little, I'll explain you.
I'll explain you.
Years ago, a passenger had
a panic attack.
Anything new?
There is not a fucking free landing track in this country!
Do make yourself bad blood, Benito!
- How is Joserra?
- Good.
He vomited everything and ...
is fine.
He is giving orders as usual.
Hey, it's very good this Agua de Valencia.
Don't you want, Alex?
It's almost only juice.
Someone has to stay sober, right?
- Joserra is sober.
- Understand!
- How you hetero are a gay couple ...
- We are not a gay couple!
- Take a little, you will get high.
- Get out!
Get high with you?
To hell, no way!
- Why are you laughing?
- Nothing.
Why?
Excuse me, Mr. Commander, it's funny
to see two big men like you...
speaking of getting high,
Agua di Valencia, of...
May I?
Sure.
Thanks.
Do not worry,
I'll tell you the truth.
You'll be fine.
What's going on?
Nothing.
Wait...
Take this.
Open your mouth.
Come, go to sleep.
Sleep.
- Go to sleep ...
- But if I've already slept!
Sleep more.
Sleep...
A glass of Agua de Valencia,
You find it pretty?
For us it has always worked.
Maybe it was not the right song.
This is how you solve emergency situations in this company?
It was to distract
That's the last time I pounded
and sit on my briefcase.
A lovely briefcase.
Norma, I guess you either ...
Yes, I will.
- Thank good.
- I loved Agua di Valencia in the 80's.
Good!
Sweet,
but with a dot bitter. Rich.
I want too.
I want another one too.
Me too!
Give me one.
I do not want to sound ungrateful ...
or eccentric.
Take.
You are right, Mr. Mas.
We are fools.
Norma,
I would like to make peace.
I was ignorant.
We were nervous,
there is nothing to excuse.
I'm glad we made peace because ...
you're one of our idols.
You started at the time of
the striptease?
At the end.
I came to Spain in early 80s.
with empty hands
And so I posed
on the cover of 'Interview'.
An historic issue, according to the magazine.
I can vouch for that.
It sold worldwide.
And how did you get into the "bondage"?
Ulloa!
None of your business
Imagine, at this point!
Well I was very young, I was very confused.
In times of confusion a girl
must listen to her heart.
And after failing as an actress
and singer,
my heart was full of hatred.
Sure it was...
I then discovered
I had natural talent for something else.
Talent to dominate!
I took the stage name "Miss Take" ...
The woman made the mistake.
In a short time,
I got faithfully
slave customers.
How crazy!
In a few years I got to the top ...
or to the lowest of human nature.
I had the power.
A lot of power.
I have 600 erotic videos of the
most important men in this country.
from "number one" to number 600 ..
Of all the colors and trends.
I am very eclectic. (LAUGHS)
600 men
You alone at the same time?
No, dear.
Me and a group of "escorts"
that worked for me,
in my own agency.
So you have erotic videos with the 'number one'?
I have several. Everyone with me.
Who is the 'number one'?
THE most important, checks accounts.
The President of the Government!
Baby, think a little!
A little bit higher than President ...
Even with the "bondage"?
No. He has more traditional tastes.
So the rumors that circulated
in the past are "real"...
Yes, but I did not say anything.
There is a security system
that sees, hears
and speaks.
Even with those who we screw.
They are also recorded, of course.
This reassures us.
These days, if there are
such documents, they will come out.
Because... you have a price.
My life is the price!
I think you give too much value
to this material.
You underestimate
the Secret Services.
They tried to rob my house
several times looking for my files!
As in "Watergate"!
The same! As you will understand,
they are not going to find them there
They are in a safe house
under another name.
I hear you have
very good relationship with the Opus.
Yes, very good...
And also with the Legionaries.
I'm going to Mexico to visit one of them.
A very important man...
Surely you know him.
But do not ask me names, huh?
Oh, I'm talking too much. (LAUGHS)
What have you put in this cocktail?
Mini champagne...
orange juice...
A splash of gin...
all mixed
with a good dose of mescaline.
Mescaline?
Hidden in an ass.
You drunked and drugged me
to make me talk!
But how I could trust you?
Look... We have put the mescaline
to make you feel better.
You notice that you're less thorny,
you like people?
Or you're horny.
Fuck!
I'm horny!
How do you do
I watched the monologue of Norma.
May I sit?
If you promise not to hit me?
Promise.
The only thing left from
my father
is the cover of magazine "Interviù".
I still have it.
I saw my father just a little while he was alive ...
I visited him when he was very ill.
He lived in a filthy room,
with empty walls.
except the cover of "Interviù."
All of you???!!???
How do you do?
Is she sleeping?
She is sleepwalker.
Better not to wake her.
Excuse me...
Last question, I swear.
What do you want?
You are doing it
in front or behind?
The only bigoted,
the only one who does not screw.
What do you do?
I am a security consultant.
But I need someone who advise me ...
And who gives me security.
Would you like to work for me?
You don't know me
I know when I can trust a man.
By the way,
Aren't you going to call your wife?
What do I tell her?
That you love her.
And the children too.
(WHISPERS) Come ...
Are we there yet?
No, but you continue sleep.
Take this.
Sleep, darling.
Take this.
This is the first wedding night.
Ciao, darling.
Hi, honey. How are you?
Good
And you? Are you there yet?
No. I'm calling from the plane.
Are the kids?
They're playing at 'Playstation'.
Today they are tremendous ...
Carmiña takes them later to the movies.
Pass them on the phone
Are you all right, Alex?
Yes, I wanted to hear you.
(SPEAKER) Children! It's dad, who wants to hear you. Toma.
Hi, papá.
Mom says you want to hear us ...
I wanted to tell you that I love you,
and you do not hit your brother,
which is bigger and one day will hit you back.
He has no balls! I'm sick!
I'll pass him. He stays here like an asshole.
- he's a pig!
- Stop listening.
When Carmiña arrives she
takes you to the movies.
(EXCITED) I love you all very much.
Alex, are you really okay?
I love you, too, Concha.
I'm glad. Call when you get there.
Kisses!
Look, the bucket! Finally!
Oh, I do not know what happened to me...
You're dropping something.
Cum!
I know what happened, slut!
Better and better!
Oops! You dropped some hair.
You are cuter.
I'm not a virgin anymore.
How come, all of a sudden?
With one in the economy class.
-- My saints have gone crazy!
-- I'm going.
I have not cleaned.
Doesn't matter, I clean.
And clean myself.
Bruna,
you must tell me everything, word by word!
What's going on?
You're flying with an apostate.
I would like having a believer here.
Especially now.
One moment, someone wants to talk to you.
Who is it?
Piedad!
It's me!
Dad?
How are you, my daughter?
Good...
I'm so happy!
Just now I was thinking of you, Dad.
Really?
I just read in a digital newspaper that the Civil Guard
has entered the Guadiana Bank,
and are confiscating everything.
Ya...
And that La Mancha airport
is a total scam ...
And they blame you.
I knew that all
would come out.
So I had to leave the country, I speak from the plane.
Sorry, Dad, I'm sorry.
Do not worry.
I'm happy to hear you,
I really wanted to!
Forget what Mom and I
said when you left.
We just want to see you.
I'm not, but your mother ...
she would be mad of joy if you call.
She changed a lot.
I do not know.
With you it would be easier.
But mama... she's impossible.
I'll be out ... several months.
I do not ask promises, but ...
please call your mother,
Give her at least a chance.
She has changed a lot!
I did not!
We love you just the way you are.
(SPEAKER) Let me think.
Ciao, my love.
Ciao, papá.
Take care of yourself
You too.
Thanks, Norma.
Peninsula 2549?
Request for Airport
La Mancha is approved.
Received.
Change frequency with La Mancha.
Received
Tell me the truth...
Will I be put in jail?
That's a good sign. It means I'll survive.
Sorry to ask, Signor Mas.
Have you killed many people?
I've fooled a lot of people
throughout my life,
but I have not killed anyone.
Why do you ask?
Sorry ...
- I behaved badly.
- Tremendous.
-- Can you prepare this tea?
You feel sick?
- I feel sick.
- Not everything resolves with fucking!
We'll see ...
We have a landing track!
Start the briefing, I'll be back.
- Piluca?
- May I help you?
I want nothing. Come on, wake up!
(Stupid) I'm awake ...
I'm Joserra, your colleague.
Where do we land?
At La Mancha, in an hour.
Take care of them.
They will ask for explanations.
They will get.
What do I say?
The truth, that you drugged them.
It is the truth ... beauty.
Good news.
We have runway.
We will land in about an hour
because we need
time to drop the fuel,
and prepare the evacuation.
It's easy!
What's wrong, Bruna?
Nothing.
Then?
Let's see, what's with that face?
You should be glad.
You just lost your virginity ...
Is that ...
What? Quick!
I smell death.
Enough is enough!
We're all shitting ourselves
and pretend as we can!
So make an effort, please!
Or, at least, shut up!
Let her talk
Explain, Bruna.
For hours I smell death.
From the beginning of trip,
but I thought they were farts.
I don't smell it in the whole plane.
In the cabin, for example, there's no smell.
Next to the phone, neither..
Neither near the couple, no smell.
Give it to her.
Near your neither, Ricardo.
Nor where the stewards are.
We remain with...
Mr. Infante... Norma...
and me.
It's me.
you. .. what?
I'm the one who smells of death.
I am a murderer for hire.
But you're not security advisor?
That too.
They go together.
Have you killed ... many people?
A few.
The next assignment would have been the last.
Well, I'm ... trying to get rid of my last request.
And how does one get rid of it?
Assuming the consequences.
I'll have to hide for a while
and change my face.
I know a plastic surgeon!
I will not insist,
we have 40 minutes to landing.
Is it me who you should kill?
Who's the client?
Signora Patricia Velasquez Vargas.
The wife of the owner of Unimexa?
The Mexican mobile phone company?
What a coincidence,,
her husband is my client!
I have a rendez-vous with him.
I will say that his wife could not count on you.
And how are you going to say?
I call now on the phone,
so you stay quiet.
Let me pass, honey.
I'll call him.
What is it?
Why are you looking at me like that?
What is it?
The victim is you, Norma.
Ms. Patricia wants to kill you.
Me?
But what have I done to this woman, I don't even know her
She doesn't see well your
sadomasochistic practices with her husband ...
Son of a bitch!
And where were you suppose to do it?
In Marbella, but I told her that
in Mexico is safer.
I wanted to save time,
prevent another one to do it.
In Mexico I would have help you escape.
Why, if you are a professional killer?
Why would risk
your life for someone like me?
(Ulloa) Sorry, Norma, I take this.
I do not kill women.
Very fair.
Good evening, Ladies and gentlemen passengers,
Joserra Berasategui speaking,
the chief flight attendant.
Following the last notice
we still have 40
tons of fuel to consume.
(CONTROL) Received. Safety Device is on and ready.
Let's take the safety position ...
Gather your knees
Separate your feet
and bow forward.
In Business Class
you can put them under the legs.
Let's revise the security position.
Can I have your attention, please?
Gorgeous, let's see ...
Gather the knees, separate the feet.
Cross your arms, tilt your body
resting the head on your arms.
Honey, arms under your legs,
there you go, wonderful.
Lady! Wake up!
Very Well, crossed arms ...
(PASSENGER) What about breakfast?
No, you will vomit on landing.
Alex, you who are bisexual ...
it is true that men suck
better than women?
What is it with this question?
Activate Ecam.
When you were out,
I let Ulloa ...
And it has been ...
Activate the approach phase.
Phase active and confirmed.
In fact we did a 69
I sucked him too ...
He is fat but has a nice cock.
Benito, do you think it's a good time
to talk about the Ulloa's cock?
Speed managed.
For me it's important
Do you think I'm becoming bisexual, like you?
No! You're a fagot since birth!
No shit!
Your wife knows it,
so she is obsessed that you could do
with men.
Continue with Ecam.
Turn on cross feed?
Yes, turn on cross feed.
I think you're overreacting, huh?
Today it happened with Ulloa
because he was drinking.
Side Pumps off.
When we did it,
you vomited.
Not that my dick nauseated you,
you liked it.
With the excuse of alcohol ...
Off to the left.
I do not know where you're going.
Oxygen crew supply to off.
Stop Ecam.
After you vomited,
you began
to ask me to screw you.
I said that a good game is short
and I had to practically take out
the cock from your mouth.
Does that answer your question?
I say this because we have to land
without landing gear and you have to concentrate.
Stop Ecam.
Good evening, gentlemen passengers,
Commander Alex Acero speaking.
Due to a technical fault we are
forced to make an emergency landing ...
(SPEAKER)... In about ten minutes.
We are heading to
Airport of La Mancha,
where the rescue teams are ready.
Please stay calm
and obey exactly
the instructions of the staff.
Once on the ground,
Compagnia Peninsula will take
of everything you need.
Thank you very much.

Good luck.
Ready for impact?
Let's go!
Come on, baby! Jump!
It snowed?
Where are we?
(GROOM) do not know. But we arrived!
Oh, what a hangover I have, dear!
Ja...
But I haven't even drank ...
Can you put the Lady?
It's me, Dad.
Piti!
You're at home!
Yes. I'm with Mom.
Have you already discussed?
Do not go, Piti! Wait, I'll be there asap!
We have not discussed,
the street
is full of policemen. Do not come, Daddy!
I'm on my way.
I want to see you! I have to see you!
We need urgent surgery.
Both of us.
I won't miss my nose
Your videos ... It may be of interest for me.
I can pay you.
Pity, because these videos do not exist.
Admittedly, I've slept
with whom I've slept ...
but I have not recorded anything.
I only did it spread the rumor,
and that was enough.
And the conversation with your assistant?
Was it also a farce?
No. She thinks there are real.
And with the time passing, I finished
to believe it too.
I understand ...
Well, good luck to you both!
You too, Mr. Mas.
How did you know you landed here?
After we spoke, I called
a friend who works at the airport.
He would not want to tell me but eventually he did.
This time I'm not lying.
No, not this time ...
Alba's phone.
This is your suitcase.
It's destroyed.
I put what I could.
Things are half-broken,
especially my gifts.
I met her.
Alba?
I saw her entering the ambulance.
She was dressed with your stuff.
It scared me and made me think
I could end up like her.
Good bye, Ricardo.
Ruth...
You will never end up like Alba.
But I must be careful.
Look, this is Nasser.
I met him in the foam.
We both feel that we met before.
Is it true?
What about the suitcase?
It's the last time I take
anxiolytics.
I had nightmares! I was shaking.
It was an idea of the co-pilot, Benito.
You have no scruples.
At least you knew from the beginning.
Speaking of Benito ...
he did blow job Ulloa.
- What?
- But I like him!
And I like him too!
You said it to Ulloa?
- He was drugged.
- Up to the neck.
I know when a man is looking in me
the woman or the transvestite.
Benito was looking for the woman.
oked at me and the woman.
-- Okay.
You already made me doubt, fagot!
Where are we going?
Where do you want to go?
To your house.
Before landing I swore that if
we survive it, I would go and live with you.
Things are fine as they are,
Alex.
I'm not being fair,
with you or my wife.
Concha thinks like me,
that we're fine.
Concha? Have you talked about this?
Of course!
Your wife and I, we tell each other everything.
How do you think this would last
so long?
She does not care that we ...
the character we have!
I did not think she was so generous
and open minded!
Yes, very open minded.
She and Carmiña have adapted
to the situation.
Carmiña?
Yes, she has also adapted
perfectly to the situation.
Concha and Carmiña?
What do you mean?
That they are together?
Is that what you mean?
Isn't it perfect?
And all behind me!
It was to make your life easier.
You could have said something,
I'm an asshole.
You never asked me.
If you would had asked,
I would have told you everything.
I have no secrets from you.
Neither with you nor with anyone!
Have you seen Benito?
What do you want, Piluca?
Have you seen Benito?
He was the first to get out of the plane.
You didn't noticed?
