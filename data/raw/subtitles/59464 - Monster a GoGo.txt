(Narrator) 'What you're about to see
may not even be possible
'within the narrow limits
of human understanding.
'Case in point: a space capsule
is rocketed into orbit on schedule.
'Its mission: to observe new objects
circling the Earth,
'satellites which no nation has launched.
'As the capsule reached its orbit,
'communications with it
suddenly went silent.
'Several days passed.
'A search team headed
by Colonel Steve Connors
'began an intensive search
of the entire area.'
This is Connors.
Go ahead, Patrol Two.
(Radio) 'Just finished the sweep.
Nothing visible but trees.
'Coming in. Over.'
Roger, Patrol Two. Come on home.
Over and out.
(Narrator) 'In a wooded area not far
'from the Space Agency
Astrophysical Laboratories in Chicago,
'observers reported that
a strange object had fallen to Earth.'
(Radio) 'This is Patrol Two to Connors.
Come in. Over.
'This is Patrol Two to Connors.
Come in, Connors. Over.'
This is Connors. Come in, Patrol Two.
(Radio) 'I've spotted something.
Looks like it may be our stray lad.
'I'm going down to have a closer look.'
Roger, Patrol Two.
They may have found something.
(Narrator) 'Was it the space capsule?'
How does it look, Jim?
(Jim) 'Hold on a minute.
Looks like...
'It's the capsule, alright.
Looks pretty bad from here.
'I'm setting her down.'
(Jim) 'There's something on site.
And...
Oh, my God?
(Jim screams)
This is Captain Connors
calling Patrol Two.
Connors calling Patrol Two!
Jim, do you read me?
Come in, Patrol Two.
What happened?
Sounds like he was in trouble.
We'd better take a look.
(Narrator) 'Without question, this was
the capsule that had put Douglas into orbit.
'And without question,
Douglas was gone without a trace.'
(Narrator) 'The helicopter pilot who had
discovered the capsule was dead.
'Horribly mangled in a way
no one had ever seen before.'
(Doorbell rings)
(Woman) Come in!
- Ah, Laura. How are you?
- How's Jimmy?
Oh, he's fine.
I just sent him over to Mrs. Williams.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Want some coffee?
- No. No, thanks.
- Tom?
- Yes, please.
Ah, thanks.
It's about Frank, isn't it?
Ruth, the capsule came back.
Well... what about Frank?
I don't know. He had all the emergency
equipment he needed, but...
Oh... well, what is it all about?
The shot was a success.
The capsule did come back.
We don't know whether
the radiation repellent worked or not.
I know I shouldn't feel this way.
It's his life, but...
Well, ever since Harry died,
Frank's been like a father to Jimmy.
Oh, Ruth, honey. Just try not
to even think about it right now.
What am I going to tell Jimmy?
Would you like me to stay the night?
I've got to get back to the lab.
If there's anything I can do...
- Thank you, Tom.
- Hi, Dr. Schreiber.
- Hiya, space cadet!
Jimmy, I thought you were
over at Mrs. Williams.
- I had get some more rocket parts.
- Oh...
When's Uncle Frank coming home?
Well, honey... he won't be back
for a while yet.
- Remember, he went on a long trip.
- He promised to take me fishing.
Well, some trips are longer
than we expected.
- What's wrong with Mommy?
- Mommy's not feeling very well.
Suppose you run upstairs
and when we're all through,
we'll have a nice big ice-cream soda,
huh?
No, I can't take anymore.
- (Telephone rings)
- I'll get it.
Hello?
(Muttering)
Where? Alright, I'll be right over.
It was Logan,
and he's located something.
Is it Frank?
I'll let you know as soon as I find out.
Wait, Tom, I wanna go with you.
Honey, he'll call if there is any news.
No, I wanna be with you.
I'll get my coat.
- Wait, I wanna come with you.
- No, Ruth. You stay here. Please.
- Douglas?
- No. Jim Taylor, the helicopter pilot.
- How did it happen?
- We don't know, sir.
We were in contact with him
from the ground car.
Suddenly, he let out a yell
and then went blank.
- There was nothing we could do.
- Take a look at the body, Tom.
I've never seen anything like it.
He's shriveled up like a dried prune.
Looks like some kind of a burn.
But it didn't touch his hair or his clothes.
- What about the capsule?
- That's what's left of it.
- He didn't have a chance.
- There's something else I wanna show you.
What do you make of this, Tom?
They look like severe burns.
What could have caused such burns?
I don't know.
Probably some kids' prank.
Dr. Schreiber, we're taking Taylor's body
back to the hospital.
- Oh, good. What about the capsule?
- The equipment's on the way now.
Alright. But I want you to stay here
until it arrives.
I don't want anything disturbed
until Dr. Logan has had a chance
to examine it carefully.
Alright, Dr. Schreiber.
We'd better get back to the lab.
There's nothing more we can do here.
Nora?
- What are gonna tell Ruth?
- We're gonna tell her the truth.
- Can we, Tom?
- What do you mean?
There's no real proof
that Douglas is dead.
There's no body.
Maybe we shouldn't tell her anything.
Nobody hopes for a miracle
more than I, Henry.
But there's no sense grabbing at straws.
Even assuming he was blown clear
of the wreckage before his oxygen ran out.
The wreckage here is enough
to tell the story.
I'm not convinced.
The condition of that body...
something's not right.
Well, we'll probably get
the facts in the laboratory.
Maybe you're right.
(Machines beeping)
- I thought you went home.
- Too much on my mind.
When did you get back from the lab?
I never went home either.
I kept thinking about the body.
Something about it bugs me. Worries me.
So I've been trying to find an answer.
So, here I am.
- Did you come up with anything?
- Take a look.
You know enough about these things.
- This is human tissue.
- Correct.
But it's different, though.
I've never seen anything quite like it.
I took it from Taylor's body.
He was literally cooked to death
in a matter of seconds.
By what?
Something so charged with radiated energy,
contact caused instant death.
You infer the capsule came back
with radioactive energy?
The capsule didn't kill Taylor.
It's here. Look through the scope.
Well, he's passed his medical.
Seems normal.
It is. No radioactivity.
Then it was something else?
Remember the scorch mark
on the ground near the body?
Whatever killed Taylor stood
or was placed right where the body was.
Analysis of the grass from that spot showed
clearly the same effects as on his body.
Henry, I know what you're driving at,
but... it's impossible.
- Douglas couldn't have survived.
- Why not?
The nose cone of the capsule did.
The chute opened.
I'm aware of that.
But we both know how it passed
over our radio signal.
Even if I go along with you
on the assumption that Douglas is back,
where is he?
And why should he be radioactive?
His body was loaded with repellent.
I don't have the answers
to those questions yet.
But my brother and I are working on it.
Let's face facts.
One: a capsule comes back.
Two: a man is seared to death
by an unknown force.
Three: we know an excessive amount
of radiation came back with the capsule.
And four: Douglas is missing.
But the radiation is what bothers me.
- Did you tell Dr. Manning of this?
- No, not yet.
And I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't either,
at least until we have
some more answers.
I need a little more time.
Well, it's entirely up to you, Henry.
Take as much time as you need.
But pray that something else
doesn't happen.
Well, I'm going now.
- Goodnight, Henry.
- Goodnight.
Well, we're finally going to meet
the invisible member of this project.
Yes.
It's a strange feeling working for three
years with a man you've never met.
(Narrator) 'The episode was
considered important enough
'for the civilian head of the project,
Dr. Chris Manning,
'to make an emergency visit.'
Carl. It isn't often we have
such a short time between visits.
How are you, Connors?
- Fine, thank you, General.
Dr. Chris Manning, Dr, Schreiber,
Captain Connors.
- Dr. Schreiber.
- This is a real pleasure.
I've been looking forward
to meeting you for a long time-.
- The pleasure is mine, Doctor.
- I'm impressed with some of your theories.
- I'd like to discuss them with you one day.
- Alright. I'd like that.
I pulled Chris off a vacation
to come down here with me.
After Logan told me about the pilot,
I decided it was time to break security
and bring you two together.
I would like to examine the body
as soon as possible.
They should be finished with the report.
We can go to the hospital directly.
- Fine.
- I'll fill you in on the details on the way.
(♪ Rock 'n' roll record playing)
(♪ Music over dialogue)
(Narrator) 'What changes
the delicate interlocking of fate
'that determines life or death?
'A series of "ifs".
'If the girl had danced with her boyfriend
instead of the other boy,
'and they had stayed later.
'If the two of them hadn't parked
to kiss and make up.
'But that is not what happened.
'And fate and history never deal in' 'ifs.
(Dog barking)
(Barking continues)
(♪ Music over dialogue)
(Screams)
Good God!
What happened to him?
From the looks of him, General,
I'd say the same thing
that happened to the helicopter pilot.
- Who found him, Captain?
- One of the search parties.
Did they see anything?
- No, Doctor. Not a thing.
(Woman groaning)
What's that?
(General) Over here, Chris!
I think she's alright, General.
She's in shock.
Let's get her right back to the lab.
- Whoa, easy.
- Come on.
- Got her?
- I got her.
(Dog continues barking)
(Narrator) 'Dr. Logan,
puzzled by the laboratory analysis,
'made his own exploratory trip
back to the landing area.
'His theory was proved right,
'and it was proved right
so unexpectedly and so violently,
'that he never lived to record it.'
(Birds chirruping)
(Signal pulsates and crackles)
(Signal intensifies)
Aargh!
Do you remember that song?
Would you like to dance?
- Good.
You know, Chris, that dash of gray
is very distinguished.
One would think we were getting older.
Ha-ha! Aren't we?
No.
- Oh, waiter?
- Yes, sir.
- Two martinis, please.
- With two anchovy olives.
- Now how did I happen to forget that?
- That's very easy.
- How many years has it been?
- Too many, Ruth. Too many.
Chris, I've got the most peculiar feeling
that something is terribly wrong,
ever since Frank was lost.
Maybe it's nothing,
call it feminine intuition, but...
When Carl told me the capsule
had come back, I... I almost expected it.
And now, another death.
I keep telling myself
there's nothing to fear,
but I can't quite make myself believe it.
Dr. Manning?
There's a phone call for you, sir.
Oh, thank you. Excuse me, Ruth.
Er, Ruth, do you know
where Portline Road is?
Yes, it's a mile from the site.
Why, what is it? What happened, Chris?
Maybe your intuition was right.
There's been another strange accident.
- Oh, no!
- Let's go.
- What happened, General?
- Just like the others, he's all shriveled up.
- You're certain it's Logan?
- Yes.
- Oh, no.
- Any trace of Frank?
No. But we found this.
- It's Henry's.
- Right.
- Let's see.
- Over this way.
- (Ruth) Oh!
- Take a look at this.
Absolutely unbelievable, General.
He looks worse than the others.
I suppose, again, there wasn't
anybody around who saw anything?
No.
One of our men recognized Logan's car
on his way into town this morning.
The car was still there
when he came back this afternoon,
so he stopped to investigate.
- Did you find anything?
- Nothing.
What do you think
brought him out here?
I've been wondering
about that myself, Carl.
- He must've had a good reason.
- He had the counter with him.
Captain, would you boys take Logan's body
back to the lab? We'll join you there.
Alright, Doctor.
I'll go with you.
They can bring my car later.
Carl, do you have any idea
where Logan was going this morning?
No. He said he was going into town
to pick up some personal things.
- I don't know of any special plans he had.
- Maybe you'd better drop me off there.
If we can find out what brought him
to this particular place,
we might have something to go on.
Good idea.
Does that bring me up to date?
- As far as the tragedy.
- What do you mean?
Well, for the last eight weeks,
nothing has happened.
Whatever came back in that capsule
has disappeared.
I thought this was gonna be a lock-up.
I thought it was just leg work
when Manning turned it over to me.
- Leg work?
- Yeah, you know, details stuff, trivia...
There's nothing trivial about three deaths.
That's for sure. And now
I can understand Chris's concerns.
- So, let's start with it.
- Well, where do we start?
- I'd like to see Dr. Kramer.
- Well, she's probably in her lab.
- Does she work alone?
- Well, she started with Dr. Logan.
But now she works with Conrad
and his brother.
Well, let's go.
(Knocking)
Dr. Brent, Dr. Kramer.
- With the deepest respect.
- Glad to know you.
I filled him in on the details,
but let's get to the larger issues.
The floor is yours, Doctor.
- Did you run a blood count on Taylor?
- Yes, we did.
Actually, there was no blood,
it had all turned to powder.
We think that accounts
for the shriveled effect.
How long was Taylor dead
before his body was found?
Just a matter of moments before
his last contact and I arrived at the scene.
We think he was on his way
back to the copter when it got him.
What "it"?
Whatever it was that came back
in the capsule. The monster.
It's true.
We have a radioactive something or other,
seven foot tall, 400 pounds.
If we sent the astronaut up,
we got him back.
Now something changed him
or affected him in the atmosphere.
- Something caused it. What?
- Imperfection in equipment?
It's impossible. It was a perfect two-man
capsule easily controlled by Douglas.
We checked that out.
- If I may guess, Douglas is back.
- A monster? I don't know...
What about the Zanpedium-51
he was taking, the radiation repellent?
Well, yes, we actually gave him
lots more of these injections,
so that he could withstand
all kinds of rays.
Well, did Dr. Logan keep a log?
- Certainly.
- May I see it?
Yes.
Excuse me.
This is Dr. Logan's log.
You'll find it very correct.
- Do you keep a log?
- Sure.
May I see it, please?
Yes, I'll get it.
He sure is thorough.
That's why he's here.
Why did you change
Entedium-50 to 51 six months ago?
Dr. Logan thought it would be
more effective.
But 50 was very effective when tested
on animals over a two-year period.
I didn't know that. Why wasn't I told?
Well, in the first place,
it's been so nominal.
Dr. Logan was so sure
it would be alright.
Well, another thing, Doctor...
Dr. Logan states the final injection
with Douglas was 100cc's.
According to your log compared to his,
yours says 200cc's.
And both logs are accurate up to here.
Who's correct, Doctor?
I am only an assistant
in this laboratory.
I simply work here and I take my orders.
Dr. Brent didn't mean that.
Security must be upheld.
Where's Dr. Logan?
He's either in the commissary or...
perhaps he's back in the other laboratory.
Well, let's go and see him.
Thank you.
I'm not a sensitive man, I deal in facts.
I crosschecked your logs
with Dr. Kramer's.
That's proper,
you're head of the project.
Well, why wasn't I informed about
the switch from Entedium-50 to 51?
- They're almost identical.
- Then why not call it 50A?
- I said almost identical.
- What's the difference, Doctor?
Entedium-51 can stand
one half times more radiation.
- You mean the subject can stand more?
- Precisely.
How did the animal experiments
work out?
Perfectly, for six months.
Well, what would happen
with an overdose?
An overdose of anything,
candy with a child, has a bad effect.
But it's corrected.
Why did you inject Douglas with 200cc's
instead of the customary 100cc's?
- Or was that your brother's order?
- No.
Dr. Kramer's very efficient
and very observant.
I did give him an extra 100cc's
for added protection. That was my reason.
Did you ever overdose an animal?
Yes. It absorbed great quantities
of radiation.
The results, please.
I put it back in the cage
with the other pigs,
it killed every one of them it touched.
Instantly.
- Is that all?
- No.
It grew twice its normal size.
My brother developed an antidote.
It worked.
- But the animal died.
- Of what, Doctor?
The heart couldn't stand
the violent transition back to normal.
And Douglas?
He's alive out there somewhere.
Working late, aren't you?
Oh, I just had to finish this up.
What do you think of that Dr. Brent?
He's a good man.
Why?
I don't know, he sort of scares me
with his access,
He sure shows his irascibility.
He's got a job to do.
I wouldn't want it.
He's kind of strange, though.
I mean, it's been so quiet
the past couple of weeks.
I hope it stays that way.
Yeah.
No deaths, no monster reports...
I see you've made
another batch of antidote.
(Ringing)
It was your brother's last order.
(Sighs) Oh...
That does it.
Going home?
Aren't you?
Soon as I've finished
cleaning up my desk.
Goodnight, Conrad.
(Narrator) 'Dr. Logan did know
where the giant was.
'In a storeroom in that very building.
'Logan had learned that
massive doses of the antidote
'brought about an almost
human appearance.
'But with such unpredictable side effects,
'that enough tranquilizer
to subdue ten ordinary men
'had to be given each day.
'This day, it was late.
'Logan knew that each passing minute
might mean a return to violence.
'As it turned out, he was too late.
'Like his brother, the scientist had
an intuitive knowledge of the situation.
'Plus, an extraordinarily bad
sense of timing.'
(Narrator) 'Everything used to make
the antidote was in wreckage
'by the time Logan returned.
'Any chance that might have existed,
'any hope that sufficient antidote might
be compounded to have a lasting effect,
'all this vanished with one sweep
of the monster's arm.'
Hello?
Connect me to Laboratory D.
Hurry!
This is Dr. Logan.
Is Dr. Brent there?
Put him on.
Dr. Brent? I'll be right over.
Yes. It's urgent.
- What's the panic?
- Frank Douglas was here.
- What do you mean, "was" here?
- I hid him in my radiation lab for weeks.
I've been giving him an injection
of antidote.
Why weren't we informed?
Blame it on my state of shock
or my concern for Douglas's condition.
I could only think to help him first.
- Did the antidote do any good?
- Yes, he became normal.
Except for size.
Why weren't we informed then?
I could only think of logging
what I'd witnessed.
Alright, so you logged it.
Why didn't you tell us then?
I don't know. I was trying to help.
Help?
You jeopardized this whole project.
What the hell do you want from me,
Dr. Brent?
I don't have a precision mind like yours!
Alright, I made a mistake.
But the fact is, Frank Douglas
has gone with the antidote.
It seems to me you're one big mistake!
Alright, Dr. Brent...
...chalk me up as incompetent.
Well, it's alright, Conrad.
We're both a little bit edgy.
I was just thinking
one mistake can be costly.
We'd better tell Connors.
(Birds chirruping)
(Screaming)
(Telephone buzzes)
Colonel Connors.
Yes.
Where?
Alright.
- What's the matter?
- It's Douglas. He's about here.
Why, that's right near Ruth's home.
We have the house covered.
Where's Logan?
Last time I saw him,
he was in his office.
You stay here in control.
I'll be right back.
(Door opens)
Conrad, Douglas was just seen
by over a dozen people.
They panicked.
Ten of them are still in shock.
- Was anyone seriously hurt?
- No, thank God.
But he's gotta be stopped
before anything else happens.
Washington called.
They've put me completely in charge.
Now, they want results
and they want them fast.
I need to know some answers.
Is there anything else I should know?
- I'm doing all I can.
- It's not enough!
They want answers, they want them now!
Now don't mince words.
Alright, but understand
this is just a theory.
- Go on.
- Douglas is much worse.
And?
And if my theory is correct,
he gets progressively worse.
What do you mean?
Well, when I first hid him
in the other lab,
I gave him an injection
of the antidote my brother developed.
It worked,
and he became almost normal.
But the condition lasted only five days.
Then, with each following injection,
the effect of the antidote
wore off more rapidly.
What are you trying to say?
The last injection was effective
for only a few hours.
- Are you trying to tell me...?
- Precisely.
It means, Colonel, that if he is using
the antidote he escaped with,
as his body needs it,
there is no telling how bad he will get
after each injection wears off.
Do you mean he gets larger?
No, he doesn't get larger,
the radius of his danger zone does.
What happens if he doesn't
have any antidote?
I'm not sure,
but it's conceivable that within hours
he could contaminate everything
and everybody within a radius of 50 miles.
That settles it.
He's got to be destroyed.
Alert the entire division, division forces,
anything else that's available.
He's got to be kept
out of populated areas.
And I want you with me every minute.
OK, cover the house, men!
(Narrator) 'As the giant became bolder,
'his whereabouts were
more easily tracked,
'and the army was called out in force,
'because this was, after all,
an American astronaut.
'Official orders were not to fire,
'but one nervous soldier is all
that is ever needed to start a panic.'
Hey!
- You're going in the house!
- Let me go!
My God, look!
(Officer) OK, men!
(Gunshot)
(Shouting)
(Gunshot)
(Gunshots)
Douglas was at the house.
It was like shooting at a wall.
Now what, Doctor?
I... I don't know.
Well, he can't get very far.
We have the entire area surrounded.
- We'll have him within an hour.
- Yes, but then what?
(Engine sputters)
(Engine fails)
(Car approaches)
Hey, lady, do you wanna get killed
or something?
- My car's broke down.
- Well, call the Automobile Club!
Well, hey, I thought truck drivers
were the gentlemen of the road.
Huh?
Yeah, well, let's see, lady.
We can save a lot of time here. Let's see.
Well, your lights are on,
it can't be your generator.
- How did it stop like?
- I don't know what you mean.
- Well, I mean, did it stop and start?
- Oh, no, it was sputtering.
- Oh, sputtered? Oh, yeah, lady.
- Hey, where are you going?
- I'm gonna get you some gas.
- Is that all that's wrong?
Yeah, and there's a charge
for that, too.
Lady, would you mind going and sitting
in the car? You're making me nervous.
Yes, sir.
Try now. Open up your hood.
There we go.
Move over, lady, I'll start it for you.
(Engine revs)
There you are, ma'am.
For God's sake, next time
drive on a full tank of gas.
Thank you, Lancelot.
Kelly's the name, ma'am. Kelly.
- What's this for?
- My way of appreciation.
Thanks would've been enough, lady.
Driver?
Ma'am?
Thanks, Kelly.
Lancelot!
Gregory Peck?
(Engine revs)
It's been over an hour.
I know.
And I can't understand it either.
I have every available Geiger counter
scattered throughout the entire area.
- And nothing.
- With the antidote, there wouldn't be.
- How much more can he have left?
- There were about 300cc's left to start with.
That means he'll soon be out.
Then I strongly suggest you inform
the general public in the entire area.
(Radio) 'We interrupt this program
to bring you a special bulletin.
'All citizens in the metropolitan area
to stay off the streets until further notice.
'This is an emergency.
'I repeat: this is an emergency.
'A man deeply contaminated
with radioactivity
'has been reported missing
from the Astrophysical Laboratories.
'Anyone coming near him is subject
to danger of radiation.
'Officials from the laboratory report
that the radius of the danger zone
'is constantly increasing.
'Let me repeat:
all citizens in the metropolitan area
'are to stay off the streets
until further notice.'
(Sirens wailing)
Sir, Chicago police just called.
Douglas is in the city.
- In the city?
- Yes, sir.
He got there on a truck and
the driver's dead from radiation burns.
How the hell are we going
to find him now?
You realize there's over
five million people in the city?
According to the computer,
the danger zone should be 20 to 25 feet.
Nora, how long would it take
to mix up 3000cc's of the antidote?
Not too long.
Do it.
And get it to me immediately.
OK.
We'll need an air gun
and a tranquilizing dart.
- Yes, sir.
- We'll have to find him first.
We'll track him down
with Geiger counters.
That means we'll have to get
within 20 or 25 feet.
That's much too close. He takes one step,
and we're in the danger zone.
That's a chance we have to take.
Wait a minute...
There may be another way.
If we place counters
in strategic locations,
surrounding the entire area
where the truck driver's body was found,
we could then connect the counters
to a centralized oscilloscope,
which would give us his exact position
without endangering any more lives.
It could work.
Let's try it.
What would be his radius of danger
within an hour?
Oh, about 100 feet or more.
Hmm...
It's hard to say.
Wait...
Yes, 100 feet.
If you're thinking of shooting
that antidote into him at this range,
you'd better make the first shot count.
I am fully aware of the consequences.
(Narrator) 'A city of five million people
became a huge tomb.
'The civil defense units
swung into action.
'City streets were cleared
of all but official personnel.
'With the realization that even
seeing the monster might mean
'that an individual was close enough
to absorb a lethal dose of radioactivity.
'The long wait began.'
What are we supposed to do
if something happens, just stand here?
Shut up and watch the scope.
Look! Look, we're getting something!
What's the location?
It's only a few blocks from here.
Better make that call now.
They're on their way.
Look... Look, it's going crazy.
(Sirens wailing)
- Right, where is it?
- Right here, sir.
One block forward,
and two blocks right-.
Sir, I'm losing him.
I've lost him, I can't get him anywhere.
That's impossible.
I have a Geiger counter right here.
(Beeping)
Could he have destroyed the counter?
No, sir, that would've registered
on the scope.
- Give me a counter.
- Don't be a fool!
Would you rather go?
He's in the sewers.
No, I checked with sanitation,
that's not a sewer.
It's an unused tunnel.
Hasn't been used for years.
Why didn't you tell me?
It doesn't go anywhere, sir.
Both ends are blocked.
Both blocked...
Is there any other way in?
The north entry is blocked
from the outside.
- Have this one sealed off.
- Yes, sir.
(Narrator) 'There is one terrifying word
in the world of nuclear physics:
'radiation.
'As the trail grew hot,
so did the level of contamination.
'Here was a problem that civil defense
authorities had never before faced
'and might never see again.
'Special equipment, never tested
under actual emergency conditions,
'was brought in.
'The mouth of the sewer tunnel
became the center of action.'
(Narrator) 'One of the weapons against
radiation is a decontamination spray,
'which reduces the level of radiation
in seconds.
'Would it work?
'Or would those who followed
the monster's trail be fried
'inside the lead-lined suits
that were all that man could use
'against forces too large
for him to comprehend?'
(Signal beeps and crackles)
(Narrator) 'As if a switch
had been turned,
'as if an eye had been blinked,
'as if some phantom force
in the universe had made a move
'eons beyond our comprehension,
'suddenly there was no trail.
'There was no giant, no monster,
'no thing called Douglas to be followed.
'There was nothing in the tunnel
but the puzzled men of courage
'who suddenly found themselves alone
with shadows and darkness.'
(Narrator) 'With the telegram,
one cloud lifts and another descends.
'Astronaut Frank Douglas,
rescued, alive, well, and of normal size,
'some 8,000 miles away in a lifeboat,
'with no memory of where he has been
'or how he was separated
from his capsule.
'Then who or what has landed here?
'Is it here yet,
or has the cosmic switch been pulled?
'Case in point.
'The line between science fiction
and science fact is microscopically thin.
'You have witnessed the line
being shaved even thinner.
'But is the menace with us,
or is the monster gone?'
