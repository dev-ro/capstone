I thought you graduated.
Aren't you going back to Hong Kong?
I'm going back next week.
Can I help you?
Yeah, I'm looking for my earring.
I found it.
Oh, good!
Aah!
Huh?
Thank you!
Are you all right?
Ohh!
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yes. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Sayonara.
Aah!
All right. Clear.
Hey, how was it?
Ah... I need some more practice.
Hey, Pete.
Hey, Cougar.
What's happenin'?
So, uh, got any news from Tony?
Uh, no. I got my eyes and ears
out there, but nothin' yet.
What about Virgil?
No.
Mmm.
Cougar, we're out there
doin' the best we can.
Well... you wanna have
a ride in my car?
Yeah! Yeah, I'd love to!
All right, let's do it.
Cougar! I swear to God
I don't know where they are!
I saw you
leaving Tony's safehouse yesterday!
He left town,
and you arranged it.
Real mistake,
Lieutenant Tim Victor.
Bye-bye, Mr. Undercover.
- Time to go!
- Cougar!
Cougar!
No!
No! No!
No!
No!
Aah! Aah!
Aah!
No!
Possible 32.
10-20.
We're gonna need backup.
Oh, Cougar.
I don't like this.
Don't you just love
the thrill of it?
- Hey, babe.
- Hi.
Hey, Pete.
I heard there was
quite a massacre down there.
Oh, yes. It was horrible.
- Who did that?
- Yo. Yo, let's get this done.
- Where's the stuff?
- It's all good.
Right outside the 5-0?
You crazy!
Here.
Survival kit.
Good.
So, where are we going next?
Hong Kong.
Oh, great.
So I can do some shopping.
And I can do fishing.
Right!
That's great.
Just a bit more.
That's good!
Cocky-looking kind of guy.
You lookin' for somethin'? Hmm?
Nice.
Yeah, this'll do.
You modify cars?
Oh, yeah. For tracks like Patia
and even some for McKell.
Well, I'm into street racing,
like around town.
I like a place where
I can leave the cops in the dust.
We can't do that.
It's illegal in Hong Kong.
I don't care.
Get your boss down here right now.
Can I help you?
Is something wrong?
About time.
Listen up.
This car's fast,
so I need hood locks,
and I need bigger brakes
on the front and on the back...
competition size.
And this tail pipe's gotta be bigger.
Much, much bigger.
About the size of my...
Well?
Have you been listening to me?
I've been telling you what I want.
Do I have to go through it
all over again?
You're so busy, you don't need work?
I'm paying cash!
Go to hell!
Huh?
My mistake. Sorry, sir.
So, you don't need the work?
That's okay.
There's plenty of other mechanics.
Now drive. Sorry!
Excuse me.
Thank you.
The guy doesn't want my cash!
What can you do?
See you! Bye-bye.
Go on, get outta here!
Come on, back to work.
Where are the girls?
Not back from school yet.
- Hey! Come on!
- What?
- Are you hungry again?
- Mm-hmm.
I can't even think
about food right now!
Hey! Don't go!
- Yeah, yeah, baby!
- Oh!
How 'bout a drink...
just us four?
There's a karaoke place
down the street.
- Bet you got a great voice.
- Come on!
Did you buy enough, May?
You might as well get lots or you'll
just have to keep coming back for more.
- Gonna get fat.
- Hey! Sue!
Ooh!
Not these two, John.
Ah!
- You pig!
- Who, me?
- Look, there's a spider on your leg.
- Come on.
She's a cutie.
Hey, buddy,
you must be new here.
- Quite a guy.
- Yeah.
Well, I wouldn't dare touch her.
You scared of some little girl?
Not the girl, you big fool, no.
- Then what?
- That's what.
Good luck.
- Nice knowing ya.
- Okay, here we go.
Hey, you!
Looks like
you've got a problem!
Now...
We'll talk business.
I never touched her, sir!
Pick a hand.
This one.
Put it on the table.
Know what I'm going to do?
Yeah.
Yaah!
Don't ever do it again!
What happened, Foh?
Nothing.
Go on. Go, go!
- You never touched her?
- I peeked.
Not my eyes!
If I see you again...
- Thank you.
- Now get out of here!
I'm gone.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
Some no-goods messing
with my sisters.
You need to get all your guys
ready tonight. Another operation.
- Okay.
- Come on, let's go.
My head!
Looks like
he learned his lesson.
- See you later.
- Bye.
Pull over to the right.
Keep going through.
Keep movin'.
Okay, go ahead.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
Follow the directions.
Let's go. Okay?
The expressway is closed tonight.
It's the second time
this week that police have set up...
Cut! Cut!
You cut me!
Danny!
- Freddie.
- What's up?
- See that vehicle over there?
- Yeah.
Tell him to get it out of there.
It's messing up my shot.
Don't be so ridiculous, man.
Do you think you're in Hollywood?
This is the news!
Get on with it!
What's the big deal?
What was the offense?
No tags?
Give us the ticket and we'll go.
If you want to go, get a taxi.
The car stays here.
Why?
I think your car's
been modified illegally.
- For crying out loud!
- No, he did not!
Maybe you need to
get your eyes checked!
It stays.
That man will know the answer.
Hi there, Mr. Tung.
Hi, sir.
Kind of crowded, isn't it?
- Yep. It's all yours.
- All right. Let's get started.
Hi, Foh!
Hi.
Adjustable shocks.
Get it outta here.
- It's all factory issue.
- Hook it up.
Over-sized calipers.
Drilled discs.
Tow it.
Give me a break, will ya?
Hood locks.
Tow it.
My car's all standard.
Standard?
With those tires?
Tow it.
Come on.
Hook it up.
This one's got a booster rocket.
Tow!
All right.
Let's get started.
Give me that safety chain.
- Stop!
- Get him!
Wow, he's movin'.
Yeah, and he's got no plates.
All right. All right.
Let's get towing.
Yeah.
- That's one hell of a car, eh?
- Yeah.
- You're gonna look great. That's it.
- Thank you.
What's going on?
What're you doing?
Background shots.
A car just ran the roadblock
and you're filming her?
You idiot!
Come on!
Come in, Delta 7.
Delta 7, do you read me?
Delta 7, copy.
Close the road!
Tell them we need more people!
Just had a car run the roadblock.
Need additional backup. Copy.
Delta 7, target is coming back
your way. Stop him.
Block the road.
Hurry!
Joe! You okay?
Call H.Q.
Black car, headed north.
Did you get it, Danny?
Did you get it, Danny?
Yes!
- Yes!
- Wow!
Brake!
Brake!
Wow! He barely
slowed it down.
He won't make it!
Slow down!
My God!
- All right. Is everybody here?
- Yes, sir.
John, let's get started.
This is the man from Interpol,
Steve Cannon.
He's giving the briefing
on tonight's operation.
This is the man
in the black car.
His name is Warner Krugman,
a.k.a. "Cougar."
He heads the syndicate.
Not only does he race cars,
he's a killer.
He's the outfit's number one.
- Can you do it?
- No, it's so difficult.
- What's she doing wrong?
- I can't make it work.
Do it like this.
Twist it. Twist it.
Give it a good spin.
Oh! I got it!
I got it!
Careful. Careful.
Watch it.
- You can't do it.
- Here. Keep at it.
- Hey, dad, call the police station.
- Okay.
I gotta get back to work.
Go. Come on.
- I got it. Look!
- You can do it. Go! Go!
- You nearly had it.
- See ya.
See ya.
- It's broken.
- Come on. I'll show you.
Have you done it yet?
No. Stupid top.
Here. I'll make it work.
Watch this.
Well done, Foh.
Here. Try it with a glass.
Look! It's magic.
Hey, that's pretty good.
Do it some more
so we can see how.
- It's a good game.
- Do it again. Please.
Okay.
Here we go.
There.
Give me that.
Watch this.
Now... There you go.
Now let's take the bowl
away like that!
Give me the glass!
Give me the glass!
Now put the top inside.
Amazing!
Look at that.
- Yes!
- You wanna try?
- Hey, Foh!
- Huh?
We're gonna stake out
that road racer tonight.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Come in, Tung.
This vehicle is not our target.
I know that.
I don't think I'll ever forget
the sound of that car!
Hey, Koo, can you tell me
what make that is?
It's a...
Celica.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
GTO!
No, wait.
Porsche.
- Got it.
- Truck with a leaky exhaust.
No!
Koo, you're useless.
You'll never learn.
Danny,
are you ready yet?
Look, I'm used to working
with high-tech gear.
Amateur stuff like this
is a nuisance.
Am I supposed to work in secret
with a giant camera?
Like people won't notice you
parading in your short skirt!
It's not my choice.
I don't want to wear this stuff.
They said to be creative.
They'll have me
in a swimsuit next.
Well, I don't
see you complaining.
- Could we get back to work now?
- Okay.
- Action!
- Good evening.
City View coverage,
live from the freeway,
continuing the series,
this is Amy Ip.
Today... an illegal road racer
showed up several nights ago,
and now many strange
and mysterious people,
like the men in this truck,
have been showing up here.
Who are they
and what do they want here?
Come with me
and let's find out.
Excuse me, sir.
But I noticed...
- What's going on?!
- I wanted to ask you some questions...
No video!
Don't worry, the station
will cover your face.
No one will see you.
No. That never works.
You can always recognize the people.
Here, I'll show you.
Just put it in front of you.
I'm not saying anything.
All right. Thanks.
See ya.
I told you to be discreet.
No one wants to talk
when they see a microphone.
Now what, Mr. Wiseguy?
Okay. No problem.
Pretend I'm him.
Interview me.
Hey!
Where's our guy?
Three nights
waiting for nothing.
- "A," "B," and "C" can go.
- Okay, sir.
Teams "A," "B," and "C,"
return to base.
Teams "A," "B," and "C,"
return to base.
"B" team copies.
- Back to base. Let's go.
- Yes, sir.
"A" team returning to base.
See ya.
Good luck.
- We're outta here.
- Yeah, we're going, too.
- Danny.
- Rolling!
We're not rolling.
That's it for the night.
They're calling it off.
- Another wasted night.
- You're right. Let's go.
We'll get 'em one day.
- What's going on?!
- Oh, so, you're awake?
Sure.
You know me, boss.
I can't believe it.
What's wrong
with the car, Danny?
- I have no idea.
- So, what are you doing?
I thought I might see something
really obvious, like...
Amy.
Wait. A tow truck.
Tow truck.
Wait! Come back!
So?
It's a broken fuel gauge...
or no gas.
Sell 'em a gallon of gas
off the truck.
I knew I'd forgotten something
at the gas station!
It was the gas.
That's why it's empty!
You! You're always arguing
and rushing me! Why?!
You forgot the gas?
Do you forget your head
before you go out?
When you drove out of the gas station,
you damn near hit us! Whoosh!
You didn't even look
where you were going, did you?
If you keep driving like that,
you're gonna kill someone soon! Humph!
You don't want to put gas in the car,
then you'd better get an electric one.
And while you're at it,
stop being so rude to the lady here.
I'm sorry. Here's...
Hey, don't talk money to me.
I'm a civil servant. He's the guy.
It's ready. All done.
So, what do I owe you?
Wait, wait, wait.
Not so fast, young man.
Next time it won't be
out of gas.
It'll be a breakdown,
meaning we tow it.
And when it's at the garage,
it'll need repairs.
And that's gonna cost you.
You got it? You understand me now?
- Yes, I understand.
- Don't forget.
You're all set.
Call the cops!
- It's that car!
- Where's he going with our car?
- Get out of the way. Call it in!
- Okay. Got it!
Wait! He's got
the girl in there, too!
Don't just stand there!
Aaaagh!
Waaaah!
Look out!
Where is he?
- You got a phone?
- Yeah.
Then get it!
Will you slow down a bit
so I can get it?!
How can I slow down?!
Aah!
Call the police.
Get the road race unit.
Tell them it's Foh.
- No one is answering.
- Move down.
Move down!
- Through yet?
- It's still ringing.
Yaah!
Foh! We'll flip over!
Aah!
I'm gonna throw up!
Aah! Aah!
Did they answer the phone yet?
Hold on.
Where do you want them
to set the roadblock?
How would I know?
How would I know?
Yuen Long intersection.
Yuen Long intersection.
Foh! It's back there!
What now?
Just do what I said!
Just do what he says, man!
The truck!
Wheee! Yah!
Tell the men, don't shoot
unless I give the order.
Yes, sir.
Hang on!
Aah!
He's disappeared!
Yeah, don't worry.
I think he'll turn around.
I'm sure he will.
Yeah! There he is!
Uhh!
Hold on!
Whoa!
Get him!
Stay in the car!
- Show us your hands!
- Come on, miss.
Get me out.
Get me out.
Hold your fire!
We got him!
Let's get him out of the car!
City View production office,
Jerry speaking.
It's me, Amy! I've got a great story!
The Road Racer.
One of the tow truck drivers
commandeered our car
for a high-speed chase.
I saw the whole thing!
Wow! When can I see
the pictures?
Pictures, Jerry?
What do you want?
I'm running a TVshow, Amy.
I've got to have pictures.
Come on, boss,
you're putting me on.
Don't you want an exclusive?
I'll describe it all.
It'll be exciting.
A great program!
This isn't talk radio, Amy.
And don't try to sell fake stories.
Especially to me!
Jer...
Miss, excuse me.
This is the statement you gave us.
Could you check it
and then sign your name?
Don't worry,
I'll get you out soon.
Hey, you!
You're good!
I want you to race with me.
Any way you like...
on or off-track.
And I'll provide you
with everything.
Money, car...
you name it.
I'm not a racer.
You're going to jail anyway.
My client's passport is genuine.
Give me a break, would ya?
It's a two-bit Libyan passport.
So what? It's legal and it says that this
gentleman here is not Warner Krugman.
That man there is Warner Krugman.
I know it is.
Very well.
Then you have 48 hours to prove it.
Look, 48 hours
isn't enough time.
I need three days minimum
to get the information from Interpol.
No. Forty-eight is forty-eight,
and you have 30 hours left.
Okay. Fine.
Answer me one question...
is this the man that was sitting in the car
that struck the policeman?
He's leading the witness!
Okay, I'll rephrase the question.
Have you ever seen
this man before?
I don't know.
What do you mean
you don't know?
My client is not guilty!
- Look, I know you saw him...
- He should be released!
That's enough!
I am in charge here.
Hi, guys.
Okay, Freddie, let's get
set up in the living room.
My brother was captain
of the gymnastics team.
And look, he won this in Macau.
It's the Portuguese
Championship cup.
Then we have to film it.
Get a good shot, Danny.
- Hold it steady now.
- What else is there to see?
I found my brother's
picture as a baby.
- He's got nothing on.
- Big baby!
Wait! What's this?
What are you doing here?
Give me that!
Put it away!
What do you two girls
think you are doing?
Sorry, but...
Dad's out of the house,
and you let just anyone in?!
Okay, I'm ready.
Does this look all right?
You'd better get changed.
All right, sir,
you'll probably want to shoot me first.
If you do it over here...
We're gonna be on TV.
Let's go.
- Right.
- I don't look too gray, do I?
- No, it looks great.
- 'Cause I wanna look my best.
I didn't know
you had so many talents.
In the interview,
you could talk about
all your athletic awards.
I didn't do athletics.
Okay. Gymnastics...
I'll say you're the champion,
and that you're the greatest
car racer in all the world!
I'm not the greatest racer
in the world.
No one knows that.
The audience doesn't care.
They like people who win.
I do not want
to be interviewed!
I understand.
I can't force you to do it.
But... I am going to do
an interview with your family.
May, you said you'd show me
how well you play the drums!
Do you really want to hear?
Come on, they're out back.
Here you are.
Hey, be careful.
Would you guys get moving?
- Okay.
- We're on our way. Come on.
- May I help you?
- Don't get smart.
- Where's Foh?
- Upstairs. What do you want?
- None of your business!
- Get back to work, you guys.
What's going on?
Get off that hoist!
So you're Foh?
- Nice to meet you.
- There's someone...
Go on, go on.
You can talk now.
I got a message for you.
You're talking to the cops a lot!
Don't do it anymore!
Uhh!
Aah!
Who knows?
Now and again guys don't listen.
See this?
It should cover the damage. Here.
Aah!
Aah!
Get him!
Get out!
Guhh!
Turn it off!
Turn it off, please!
I said get out of here!
Let's go!
Here. Sign it and we can go.
Sign here.
Bye-bye, cutie.
Stay right there!
Things have changed.
Go ahead.
I saw him the other day.
Last Saturday,
he was driving a black GTR.
He hit and killed a cop.
You recognize him?
Yeah.
- You're under arrest!
- What? You can't do that!
- It's a mistake!
- You have no right to detain him.
- He's just been released!
- You have the right to remain silent.
What is going on here?
Would somebody
tell me what...
We'll have someone come along
and spell it out for you, okay?
Have a beautiful day.
Thank you very much.
What the hell is going on here?!
Okay, guys, look.
Let's get on the phone to the states.
Let's go!
My friend, you are a perfect liar.
Call the FBI and Interpol.
Call Interpol first,
as a matter of fact.
We got everything covered for you...
security, everything.
You can go now.
Don't worry about a thing.
Let me talk to them
as soon as you get through.
- Fresh chicken wings!
- My favorite!
Oh, great, Dad!
Let's get 'em on the grill!
Yes!
Amy...
I'll get them
put in an album for you.
Look. Have you seen this paper?
It's fantastic.
Look at it.
Foh, you're a hero!
If only your mother
was still alive.
Amy, can I ask...
do you like being a star?
I'm not really a star,
more like a struggling actress.
These news programs keep me busy till
one day I get a chance to work in movies.
How about you making a career
as a journalist?
I gave it some thought.
Nowadays you need a degree
to be a reporter.
How's your job different
from being a reporter?
To me? Well,
there are some new shows
that look a lot like my program.
But there are some differences.
Hey, you going to eat
or just talk all night?
I'm talking while
cooking my chicken, okay?
- Here!
- No mic.
It's only candy.
No, thanks.
- Hey, I'll have some!
- Me too!
Amy, dear, could you
help my daughters get into TV?
- Can you?
- Dad! You heard what Amy said.
You've got to be a college graduate
to be a reporter on TV.
Learn to be good students
and then give movies a try.
No, I meant
when they start a career.
But if we study real hard
and finish school...
Oh, come on, please, Dad?
Hey, did you get
some good stuff?
No! It's impossible
to do anything!
Come on! Nearly three hours
and you don't film anything?
All the time you're
just wasting on this guy!
It's not wasted time.
I'll show the city our hero
whether he likes it or not!
Testing... one, two, three.
Loud and clear.
Steve, those documents arrived.
Oh, good.
Okay.
You forgot something.
Thank you.
Control room 2.
Corridor 3.
If you want to leave,
press the red button.
Mm-hmm.
Bingo!
Show time!
Ready.
Good morning.
Your pass, please.
See what's going on!
- Cougar.
- Baby!
Come on, let's go!
Get down!
Get down now!
Come on, hurry up!
Aah!
No!
Give me that!
Bastards!
Here! Give me that gun!
You're all gonna die!
Let's go, go, go!
Aah!
- Kill him!
- Get in the truck!
Damn!
Hey, Cougar,
why don't you just kill the guy?
It's a lot too easy to use a gun.
This is my game.
Only a cat knows how
to play with a mouse.
It's your call.
What's happening?
Foh! Foh!
Foh! Foh!
- Papa, what is it?
- It's Foh! Foh's still inside!
Foh!
Foh! Foh!
- Hang on!
- Hold tight!
Foh!
Come on, girls!
My son!
What's going on!
Here he comes!
Look out!
Get out of the way!
Papa!
- Sue, give me your hand!
- Help me! Help me!
Damn it!
Come on!
Don't let go of me!
Sue, stay there!
Help me! Help me, Daddy!
Help me!
Hang on, Sue!
Don't move!
Yeah!
Sue...
Say something.
Sue!
Speak to me!
Say something!
Say something!
Foh!
I'll get her!
- Papa!
- Dad, let go of her!
Papa, get over here!
All right.
Hang on, children!
Come here.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Argh!
My chest!
Papa!
Papa!
Pa! Pa!
Hey, you!
Feeling good?
I feel great!
You're gonna race with me!
- Never!
- I promise, you will!
And remember... this little secret
is between you and me.
Oh! I'll see you in Japan.
My heart!
Pa! Pa!
Clear! Move out of the way!
Give us room!
Papa!
Papa!
Papa!
Easy! Easy!
Could we get a picture
over here?
Quick! Do some magic.
Get yourself in there.
Do whatever it takes!
- I'll try.
- Go!
Excuse me.
I'm related... his daughter.
Nobody can see them yet.
The doctors are still working.
Muscles are too taut.
Relax a bit more.
And we'll try again.
All you press people
wait outside.
He's too tense.
I can't get the needle in.
- Police! Where's Foh?
- You've got to relax.
Okay, that's better.
Just relax.
Doctor, can I ask him
a few questions?
Keep it short.
Foh, are these the men
who did it?
Give me
another 50 CCs, nurse.
Look, these guys are animals!
There's one thing
I don't understand, though.
They break up your home,
they kill two of my men,
but they don't kill you!
So I'm wondering,
have you guys got some special deal
going on now or what?
Hey!
- Officer, that's enough!
- What are you doing?
- Nurse, call security.
- What do you mean by that?
Not what you think!
Hey, what are you doing?
Look what you did
to my family!
- Let go of me!
- Don't talk to me.
You just think about Cougar!
How about people?!
You guys are all alike!
- You don't care about anyone!
- That's not true! I do care!
- No, you don't!
- That's enough!
Gentlemen, please. Please!
Do you know
what they did to us?
My father's in there dying
'cause of you!
It's your fault!
You deserve to die!
- Miss, I'm sorry...
- We're related!
Stop it! I'm warning you!
Go ahead, kill me!
Go on, do it!
I'm sorry.
I-I'm sorry.
It'll be okay.
It'll be all right.
I've got you.
You're all right.
Just relax.
It's okay.
I'm here with you.
You're going to be all right.
You're gonna be okay.
Relax... Relax.
Foh, please...
Just relax...
Relax...
This'll make you feel better.
Much better.
There...
Thank you.
Amy, hi. You here to do
another interview?
No. What an awful mess.
It's a disaster.
Look at this place.
But the real problem is
we've got no cash.
We can't even pay these guys.
That's terrible.
Koo, I found the checkbook.
Six hundred, that's it.
He wants to go race on that?
It won't even pay
for the tires.
You said "race"?
Tell me where.
All he said was
he's gotta race.
Is Foh here?
Over there.
I haven't seen the girls.
Don't talk so much.
Do some work.
The wind makes
a nice change.
On my way to work, I looked in
to see you in the hospital.
They said
they discharged you.
Would you like me to go with you
to see your papa later?
What is it?
What?
My bag's empty. See!
I didn't bring a camera,
a microphone or a notepad
or anything else
to make a story!
Look, I don't want an interview,
but I feel really stupid standing here
talking to myself!
- Just let me be!
- Let me help you somehow.
Help me how?
With your camera and notepad?
Leave me alone.
Maybe I can't help you,
but I can help Sue and May.
I'll look after May!
I'll look after Sue!
I'll look after all of them!
I was just concerned!
Are you really
going to start racing?
I don't wanna know
why you're doing it,
but I know it must be
very important to you.
Concentrate on racing,
and leave the other things to me.
There are lots of things
I can do to help.
Not on the really big problems.
Leave the smaller problems
to me, that's okay.
I know that most things
I can't do.
But there is one thing
I can take care of.
You need a car, don't you?
You'll catch cold.
Wow! Little stuff,
big stuff... everything!
Yeah, but where'd
all this stuff come from?
We've got no money!
Never mind!
We're going to race in Japan.
Come on.
Let's get to work!
- SBC.
- SBC, one set.
- Turbo timer.
- Timer, one.
- Nothing else?
- That's it.
- That's it.
- All done.
- What have you got, Foh?
- Camshaft.
- Camshaft...
- There it is.
Thanks.
- One set of calipers...
- Caliper? Cal...
There, right there.
Call out the numbers of the parts.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
- MZ 60036. Tachometer.
- MZ 60036.
- Did you get it in France?!
- No, at the market.
- Would you like a drink?
- Here. Have a drink.
- Drink some water.
- Okay.
- Take a break and drink some water.
- What? No soda?
If I had some,
I'd give it to you, wiseguy. Here.
Koo!
Throw me a 27!
Catch!
Have some water.
It's for Foh, not you!
Give me that!
I need to drink, too!
Then go get yourself one.
I'm not a waiter!
Everybody's treating me
like a servant.
That man is a study in grace.
You think so?
When a guy can zero in like that,
he looks so, so good.
Come on, now. Catch me
when I'm eating, and you'll see "good."
Just like a sow!
So, where are we gonna find a place
to test this car in Hong Kong?
Foh knows a place, huh?
I do.
- Inspector.
- Just this once.
- Thank you, sir.
- Let's get ready.
"A" team ready.
"B" team all set.
- "C" team in place.
- Okay. You're all set.
The road's closed.
Keep moving... that way.
Inspector, there's a car!
All right. Just hold it.
I can't.
It's the governor's car.
What? Calling team "C."
Get moving!
Well, well,
I'm in the headlines again.
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop!
There's been an accident.
Let's go!
- Are you okay, sir?
- Oh! My neck! My neck!
Let's get you out of here, sir.
Careful, you fool!
The queen's gonna hear about this!
Foh?
Foh...
What is it?
You need this. The race committee
said all drivers do.
I already had
all your information put on it.
What don't you know?
About you?
Like, do you know how to smile?
He's not quick enough.
What on earth
does he think he's doing?
Oh, the man's got to move!
That lap's even slower!
He's getting worse and worse.
What's going on?
So far he's not going very fast.
When he comes face to face
with Warner Krugman, can he win?
Oh, no, my camera!
Good. It's all right.
Cougar's people.
I knew it!
Everything will be ready
for the next practice.
- We're on schedule.
- That's right.
- Excuse me. I need this.
- I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Thanks very much.
- What's going on?
- I think she's taking...
- Oh, my God.
- I think she's taking my bike!
Hey, come back with my bike!
Hi. Could I speak to Mr. Foh?
Hello? Yes!
He's already testing the car
at the racetrack.
Of course he is,
but he won't win the game.
- Hello, sir.
- Good afternoon.
- How 'bout that!
- You're doing good!
Welcome, sir.
Hey, Foh! Foh!
- Come quick!
- What?
Those guys you want
are in there.
Foh!
Hey, Foh! I'm coming, too!
It's a men's spa.
Wait here. I'll be back.
Wait!
May I help you, sir?
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Where are my sisters?
How would I know, Foh?
They could be almost anywhere.
What did you do with them?!
Shut up!
Don't shout like that in here.
You might try taking
better care of them.
Most likely
they're in a bar or a club.
I demand to see my sisters now!
Quiet! I told you not to shout.
Someone will oblige you
if you really want to fight, I'm sure,
so take a look around
and see if you've got the guts.
What do you say, guys?
I think we need
to lighten him up a little bit.
Wait!
What do you think you're doing?
You're so lame.
I could do better on my own!
I don't have time
to waste on you today.
Walk out while you still can.
Go ahead!
Clear out!
Look, tough guy,
why don't you get out of here?
I've got other things to do.
- I thought you'd be here! Come on!
- I was in the ladies' room!
Hey, man, what you doing?
Are you crazy?
Hey!
- Go and wait outside.
- Do I have to wait out there?
Don't ask
so many questions!
- All right!
- Listen to me.
Listen to me.
We're going to close the casino.
Get out of here.
Go home.
I'm not leaving here.
I'm a winner!
This place never closes.
You!
Give me that!
Get out of the way!
You've gone too far!
You're gonna die!
So, how are we gonna
break this to Cougar?
He doesn't know
he was here.
The guy who kills him
gets ten grand!
Wait!
I'm a reporter.
Let me in, please!
Hey!
I like your style.
Here's one of your sisters.
For the other one,
win the race.
It's okay, May.
But remember...
no more tricks.
I promise.
Let her go.
I'll see you.
Sorry, there was no contestant
either by the name
of Warner Krugman or Cougar.
So there's no Cougar.
We're running fourth now.
That's fine.
So what's the matter?
You're not into it.
With these times,
you might as well
go back to Hong Kong now.
I'm sorry.
Today's the last chance
to qualify, Foh.
Pull yourself together.
Foh!
I need to speak with you.
Who's this?
So, where's your sister?
She's here.
No, the other one.
She's on a trip.
Oh, really?
Where did she go?
None of your business.
Look, I'm just trying
to give you a hand here.
I don't need your help.
Please leave me alone.
Look, you're gonna be
real sorry about this.
- You hear me?
- Let's go. Come on.
Let's get this car out there.
1 minute, 39.
- Do that, you qualify.
- Okay.
You can do it.
Let's go.
Go, go, go, go!
Thirty-nine even.
He made it.
Give me the extinguisher!
Where's the extinguisher?
Let's get this out!
Put it out! Put it out!
Come on, help me out!
Hurry! Hurry!
Put it out!
No, over here!
Out of my way!
Give me that!
Come on, come on!
Over here!
Over here! Come on!
Easy, May.
It's gonna be all right.
- Are you okay?
- Get out of here!
I'm sorry.
I can't help you anymore.
I understand.
I have to go.
That's it.
Yes, sir.
It's a shame.
Take a look at this.
What's this all about?
Whose video is this?
It's my camera.
Oh, so that's what you've been up to
all along... using us for a story.
I treated you like one of the guys.
My dad loaned me
the cash for the car.
Yeah, so you could
take pictures of us.
Foh, we've been had. She's been lying
since she walked through the door.
- I knew it all along.
- You're just a traitor.
Shut up!
You don't know
what you're talking about.
Hey, Foh, can I get you to sign
for something, please?
They just arrived.
We're racing again.
Your engine...
and your spare tires.
That's your car.
Just in case you crash,
there's another car.
Murakami-san, I don't know
how to thank you enough.
Oh, it had nothing to do with me.
Talk to her.
Thanks, Ocho.
I don't know why
you need the car,
so I thought I'd just bring
my whole team with me.
- Thank you very much.
- No need to say thank you.
After all, I forgot to apologize that day
when I hurt your hand.
There's work to do.
- Come on, let's get going.
- Yes, sir.
Whoa! Look at that!
Shut up!
She's Foh's girl!
She's not for you or me.
Welcome to the 1999
Sendai International
Spots Car Championship.
The track may get wet.
- Watch for loss of traction.
- All right.
Ladies and gentlemen.
The drivers have completed
the warm-up lap.
Remember, only authorized personnel
are allowed on the track
while the teams make
the final adjustments to their cars.
- How's the car feel?
- Very good.
All right, guys,
check everything out.
- What's up?
- Hey, kill the girl.
Okay.
Let's go. Work to do.
- Foh has all the fun.
- Yeah. That's always the way.
- Hi, May.
- Hi.
It's for good luck.
Will you give it to him?
Okay.
Amy said to give you this.
Cougar...
You won't let him win,
will you?
Five minutes to race time!
The public is now asked
to return to their seats.
Four minutes.
Press members and technicians,
please leave the track.
Three minutes.
Time now for the Sendai Racing Girls
to leave the track.
What's the matter?
Get ready.
Two minutes.
Drivers, start your engines.
Foh!
Listen, this is one of the most
difficult tracks in all of Asia,
and now the rain's
going to make it worse.
Just concentrate on the race.
This race is your chance.
You gotta leave your problems
outside the car!
- Understand?
- Okay.
One minute.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Win.
Team captains,
please leave the track.
Check the leads!
They're good!
Clear!
Thirty seconds.
Tire change!
There he is!
He's gonna go!
Come on! Come on!
Foh's doing pretty good.
Here, Foh,
have some water.
- Get away!
- What are you doing?
What on earth were you thinking?
He'll get penalized.
- Ready!
- Stop!
Interference.
Thirty seconds.
Damn that woman!
I'm sorry.
Really, I'm sorry.
- I'm ready.
- You're good.
Tires!
- Ready?
- Ready!
Ready!
Get her out of my pit!
All of you!
Get out of here!
Wow, he's going really fast.
Yeah, he might make it to sixth.
Ready!
You?
I told you to go.
Sorry. Sorry.
Hey! What the hell do you think
you're doing with that board?
- I'm very sorry.
- Damn.
Stupid idiot!
Hey, look!
Foh's second.
He needs to be in first place.
Second!
Look, look!
Come on!
Okay, go on, spare tires.
Tires out.
- Look out.
- Fueling.
Coming through!
Fueling!
- Go!
- Go!
Damn!
He's tied.
- Yeah!
- I told you! He's in the lead!
I can see!
Yeah!
Foh, you can do it.
You can do it!
Foh! Foh! Foh!
- Come on!
- He's getting out!
Bring it home.
Bring it home!
You can do it!
- No!
- Oh, God.
All right!
Cougar, get out of here.
It's all over.
Get out of the way!
Where's my sister?!
What have you done with her?!
Help! Help!
I want to know where she is,
or you're gonna die.
"A" team,
get the cuffs on Cougar.
"C" team,
you're gonna move into the pit.
Hey, Foh!
Are you okay?
You all right?
She's fine.
I found her at the spa.
Give me a hug.
I'm so relieved.
It's a great pleasure
to see you again.
Damn you.
- Thank you.
- You drove really well.
Thanks.
I mean it, you're next!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Come on!
