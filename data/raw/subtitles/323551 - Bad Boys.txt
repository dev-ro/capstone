Give me the money.
You want to die?
Where's my sickle? He's dead.
- No, Jouko. Please don't!
Keep your trap shut, bitch!
A little prick like you has no
fucking use for money yet.
BAD BOYS - A TRUE STORY
So this took your money?
- Yeah, the wheel of fortune.
Wheel of fortune, huh.
To the poor, underprivileged
and displaced. That's us.
Pull the plug. - You pull it.
- No, you. - No, you.
He won't miss a couple meat pies.
Ever since we moved here,
things have been going downhill.
Don't talk with your mouth full.
- It's still frozen.
What a swine.
- There's no swine in there.
Look what the swine has
stuffed in the closet.
This is a lot more than I put in.
- Let's take back what's not ours.
We're not taking anything back.
It's like dad said: Let the others
fill out their applications.
A wise man helps himself.
What's your time?
Twenty-two thirty-eight.
I got to get it under twenty.
Cut through the schoolyard.
- And you buy yourself a jack.
A hundred and sixty-one.
Otto, what bills did we have?
Electricity bill's first. Then
the doctor's bills if there's any.
Mom's gravestone.
- It's been unpaid for three years.
You need to go to see the dentist.
- I'll go when I get a chance.
We're paying off her gravestone.
- What about the car?
We've never put money into it.
- Pay the tab at the bookstore.
I'd rather wipe my ass with cash.
- Not with the coins we have.
You're going to come and see dad.
- I'm going to school.
You're going to pay the tab so
I can get schoolbooks next fall.
He's your dad too, you know.
- I've seen enough of him.
You've kept the cat in the closet?
- It crapped in my shoe.
A junkie come calling here?
- Came with a good appetite, too.
All you can do with hooligans
is take 'em behind the barn...
...and put a bullet in the
back of their heads.
Sorry, I didn't mean it.
I understand.
Jyrki wasn't a hooligan.
What the hell's taking so long?
Aulis, please.
A vector and its diameter are at
a constant two to one ratio.
Morning, Eero.
Been rescuing stray cats again?
This is the third time. I want to
speak with you after school.
Maybe we can find with a solution
to your waking up on time.
Sir, isn't the Laestadian religion
a revivalist movement?
Looks like someone needs
reviving every morning.
Get your dad to come preach to us.
- Tell him to be sober this time.
You boys sure are coin-collectors.
We thought that you could get
something from the canteen.
Yeah right. When your pappy does
some spending, coins won't do.
It was hard getting those coins.
I worked as a lumberjack once.
Others just kept on sawing.
I just threw a cable around a tree
and punched the gas.
Use your heads. I've shown you
how to dynamite a tree stump.
"It's gonna blow".
- And then a lot of noise.
Where's Eero?
- He went to school.
I said to stay away from school
until the government pays me back.
I wrote to the president about it.
I even phone her.
But she was on the other line
and I couldn't wait.
The government's indebted to me
for every second I spend in here.
You remember your medication?
- That whore brings them to me.
The pills don't make a difference.
- How about restraints then?
Damn it! No one deals out
discipline but me.
I have a connection to the lord.
Sorry.
They put drugs in the burgers.
- Who?
The government. So youths
can't use their own judgment.
You and your brothers don't drink,
you don't curse or even fight...
...but you're always in trouble.
I have to think what's best
for the whole school.
Pick up the pace, or I'll have
to suspend you for two weeks.
I haven't hurt anyone.
- Your attitude attracts trouble.
Act like everyone else?
- You mean fight and drink?
Don't go from one extreme
to the other.
There's also
a golden middle ground.
My family doesn't have enough
gold for that ground.
Why just the slot machine?
Why didn't they rob the register?
And usually crooks steal some beer
but not one bottle's missing.
Maybe they had hard drugs in mind.
Anyone find the cat?
- Say what?
Maybe they left the register
alone on purpose.
Where's the logic in that?
- That's what I'm wondering about.
Isn't there any other place
for our dad?
They don't hand out rooms to bums.
Put him in home care if you can.
How much does that cost?
- Do I look like a price list?
If the old man's coming home,
I'm leaving. - He's your dad, too.
Like the Dalton brothers, stupidity
grows with height in your family.
All you need is a dumb-ass dog and
you'd be like the real Daltons.
Have your dad call us and
preach his ass off.
I don't think the sucker has
the money to buy a phone.
Aulis, stop it.
- Keep your fucking mouth shut.
I don't think the boy knows
anything about pussy.
But that's why they have
all those animals.
You're all just a bunch
of little cock suckers.
Dishing out your own
personal justice.
You draw faster than your shadow.
- But you have no use for pussy.
What? Pirjo, fuck, stay put!
- My name isn't 'Pirjo Fuck'.
Hey, don't fucking try me. I know
you're not allowed to hit anyone.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Fucking whore!
You shouldn't get in trouble
because of me.
Aulis is such a prick. He thinks
he's like everything that he owns.
He owns a lot.
- You're so different from them.
A beamer!
Smoking kills, says
the surgeon general.
My lord, if you help me now,
I'll give you this beamer.
Hello, I'm Dr. Ritvala. It's a
good thing you came along.
You're driving a bit dangerously.
- I'm really sorry.
One of our patients has escaped.
- We haven't been notified.
We thought we could take care of
it in-house to avoid bad publicity.
But could you contact your HQ if
anyone's seen our missing patient?
Who is this patient of yours?
Jouko Takkunen. He's a paranoid
schizophrenic
We took him in two months ago.
He sliced his boys' bunny rabbits.
But he's also very sensitive,
but you never know.
License and registration, please.
- Here's the registration.
I don't have my driver's license.
He took my wallet when he escaped.
Was it Jouko Takkunen?
- Yes, born June sixth, 1948.
Well? - He has a couple assault
charges that were withdrawn.
We'll have to report this.
- Of course.
Why don't you go to the hospital and
interview the nurse who saw him last.
I'll get his patient file, uh...
his file from my office. Okay?
Yeah, we're about done here.
- Okay, great.
Let's meet at the hospital in a half
hour. I'll show you his files then.
Got it, thanks.
- Thanks, guys. Drive carefully.
There you go. - No need to go
pick blueberries for a while.
And we can drive the car again.
I paid the insurance.
Let's go for a spin around town.
- We can live like normal people.
Normal's what you see in
magazines and on television.
What do you know about television?
- I've seen them all over the place.
This is normal:
"People envy our happiness".
We're so far away from that.
Just look at yourselves.
Just look at me.
Cottage cheese and fruit salad,
that's the best.
Where'd you learn to do that?
- You learn when you have time.
What do you wanna be when you
grow up? - A normal person.
You already are.
- I am not. I don't know anything.
Yes, you do.
This religious shit's out of here.
This is my dad's place and I have
a right to choose the customers.
I don't want bums in here.
- I paid for this drink.
And now you drank it.
Get the hell out of here.
Stop it. Are you crazy?
- Why don't you go cry to daddy.
Just go home.
- I'm not going anywhere.
There's no problem. Right, Aulis?
- Yeah. I'm sorry I got upset.
We're are just going to talk.
- You'll fight as soon as I leave.
We're not going to fight.
- You swear?
I won't swear, but I promise.
What do you take me for?
We can talk this out.
Just go home, it's okay.
- Okay, see you tomorrow.
They say you're not allowed
to hit anyone. - That's right.
You realize you're going to get
your ass kicked real good.
I realize it.
- What the fuck? Help me!
If anyone asks, Eero here ran
into a big fucking door.
Oh no, looks like I
parked on the line.
Anyone else need
straightening out?
We're not hitting anybody.
We have nothing to do with the
rest of the world. Dad knew that.
Yeah, dad knew so much he's
now in a mental hospital.
You yearning for a fight?
- He's just angry at the ST guys.
I'm angry at us. If I was normal,
I'd kick our asses too.
Just calm down.
- You calm down. I want revenge.
Revenge is stupid. Let's get even.
What's the point in revenge if
they don't know who it was?
What's the point if they did know?
You sure it'll pull loose?
- I'm sure.
Man, that flew like a missile.
The police.
Police.
- Where?
Hello, I'm police chief Suutari.
- Hello.
Can I come in?
- Yeah.
I went by the school. They said
it's no use looking for you there.
You have any coffee?
- We don't drink... - Yeah.
Eero.
I'm not here about school.
You're all grown men.
You know how to read and write.
School's more for business-types.
Your neighbor's been complaining
about you using explosives.
No, we uh, we haven't.
Why don't you go to the sand pit.
- Yeah, we'll do that.
There, noboy'll hear the noise.
- Okay, we'll do that.
You're chimney clogged?
- Just wet wood that won't burn.
I came by to let you know that
your father's escaped.
If you see him, could you inform
us so we can stop looking for him?
Yeah, we'll let you know.
Oh yeah, someone stole a cash
machine from the ST gas station.
Have you heard anything about it?
- No.
Call me if you hear from your dad.
- Of course.
You have any good ones?
Two hundred and thirty.
That coffee cost us a cool 1500.
I need to have a taste of that.
How stupid can you get,
putting cash in the oven?
We couldn't leave it on the table.
These are okay, aren't they?
They're just burnt at the edges.
You can be the one spending burnt
cash after a gas station robbery.
We're so stupid, we deserve this.
- No secret's safe from you.
Eero, don't.
- Let him go. He'll be back.
Eero has a point.
This can't go on like this.
Yes, it can. It's not the only
cash machine in the world.
Hi there.
- Hi.
You haven't barbecued in a while.
- No.
You all right?
- Yeah.
Wanna go hang out
at the ski ramps?
Why'd you come here?
Why do you want to talk to me?
- I don't know.
You ever kissed anyone?
- Of course.
Yeah, right. Who?
- A girl in elementary school.
Yeah, whatever. How old were you?
Eight? - Ten.
That doesn't count.
- So then it doesn't.
You want to kiss?
- Why?
It's hard to explain why you want
something when you really want it.
I want to.
- So are we going to kiss?
Yeah.
Why'd you laugh?
- I didn't laugh.
You did. You clearly laughed.
I didn't laugh.
It was just a ref... ref...
A reflex? When you kiss,
you laugh? Is that it?
It's just a habit we have.
- What kind of habit?
When a lot of bad things happen
to you, all you can do is laugh.
So you laughed when I kissed you,
because it was a bad thing?
Yeah. No, I mean no.
- You're such a pig.
I was just a little scared.
- You know, you're not normal.
That's what I've been trying to tell
you the whole time.
I'm here for my kids' sake. I want
them to have a happy childhood.
I had it rough growing up.
- Your kids old enough to work.
That's what I mean. They need new
bikes to get to their summer jobs.
And you had those construction
supplies we gave you.
We still do, but it's easier to do
construction work in the summer.
We've given you extra money before.
True, but adversity doesn't come
one at a time in numerical order.
I'm so scared of ending up in a
downward spiral.
Drinking doesn't make it go away.
- It just makes it worse. Sorry.
Well, all right then.
But we'll send an inspector
to check on the insulation work.
An inspector, of course.
I noticed you're expecting.
How far along are you?
Let's take the drill. I think this
one's going to be a lot easier.
I have the list. Guys, stop for a
second. This should interest you.
We'll start at the Shell station
after eleven.
There won't be anyone there
working that late.
Eero, you take care of
the security cameras.
Then we'll just pluck her up.
We'll bring it to the sand pit
and empty it out.
Then we can continue straight to
the gas station in town. All clear?
Yeah, but this is the last job.
- Ilkka, Eero, you're on lookout.
Uh-mmmmmm.
- What?
Pulling a tooth might result in a
psychological lock jaw that can...
...last several hours.
Is this a joke? - No, I can't...
Say again? - I can't...
Let's gas up our car before
we rip out the cash machine.
This isn't fair
to the gas stations.
They have insurance.
Then we'll hit the Seo station.
We'll be home before dawn.
This can't be so simple.
Someone's bound to see us.
We'll be wearing masks.
- Yeah, good.
Are you sure these are clean?
- Straight from the bin.
Which bin?
- Beside the door. On the left.
On the left looking out,
or on the left looking in?
The one with the clean ones.
What's the difference?
Why are we wearing masks when
they can identify us by smell.
Let's try it... Is it open?
Guess not... Try there.
Hey, I'm this close.
Stop.
- What's the problem?
Are you drunk?
- No.
You hurt?
- Just don't come closer.
You have underwear on your head.
- Don't come closer...
I don't know what the problem is.
- Let's pull it loose.
I'll have another look.
Maybe it's the lock or
it could be a different model.
No worries. That's why we
brought the cable.
My name is Leena. You understand?
- Uhum.
Twelve robberies. That's a crime
wave and you aren't doing a thing.
We have a strict order here.
First we handle capital felonies.
We take care of property crimes
when we have the time.
You know what a machine
like that costs?
Your insurance will cover it.
Calculate vector X
and segment Y...
...to come up with the diameter,
which continues to infinity.
That's enough.
Eero, give me that note. - No.
Give it to me and go wait
in my office.
I don't think so.
This is the last drop.
If you won't behave, I'll...
What?! Write my parents?
Oh wait, my mom's dead and my dad
just escaped from the nut house.
Stop our welfare payments?
We haven't gotten anything
from there as it is.
Or maybe you'll hit me?
I've been beaten up all my life.
Anything else?
I'm... I'm expelling you.
- Ouch.
You're just going to leave me
in there as a laughing stock?
I'm not leaving you.
I'm leaving the school.
Same thing.
I don't want to stay in there with
Aulis and his crew.
What do you want?
I want you to take care of me
and protect me.
I want you to buy me gifts
and talk to me.
I want you to buy me a kitten.
I want to have sex with you.
I really do.
You whore.
You filthy, salesman-fucking...
...slimy-pussied sinful whore.
Where you going? We're not done.
- No speak Finnish...
Speak what you like,
but you're not going anywhere.
No one leaves me.
Whoring's a sin!
You'll go to hell.
But don't worry,
I have connections.
No speak Finnish. - Hell has
everything you ever wanted.
Everything at your fingertips,
but just out of reach.
If you want to go to hell,
you better do everything now.
A crime league has terrorized
gas stations for some time now.
They pulled the w hole cash machine
loose w ith a car and chain.
The police haven't caught the
culprits, but have an eyew itness.
He w as really muscular and y oung.
Foreign, I think. He had a turban.
So y ou talked to him? - Yes, but
I couldn't understand him.
It w asn't Sw edish or English.
- Estonian maybe?
It did sound a bit like Finnish.
When he saw me, he laughed.
Oopsidaisy.
- I want my money.
Stop that.
- I want my money.
You think you're going to take my
money so you can keep whoring?
Think you'll go to heaven for free?
You'll only get to hell for free.
You let out even a peep and
I'll show you hell for free.
These bandits could be pro's
sent by the Russian mob to rob...
...select gas stations. Their loot
may be as much as 100000 euros.
It sounds great, but we have
to split the money four ways.
They think we ride around in
Limousines, drinking champagne.
We haven't picked up much cash
from these last few gas stations.
Not much overtime pay in it.
- How much money is enough?
Even if we got a million, it's
only a quarter million a head.
A million will do for me. But gas
stations don't hold millions.
But post offices do.
Post offices are not gas stations.
No cable's going to open a vault.
The town post office has a safe,
not a vault. Not even bolted down.
It's bound to weigh two tons.
No Nissan's going to pull it out.
There's a construction yard beside
the post office.
And a tractor and truck.
Matti, go inside.
- You go.
No, you. - No, you!
Llkka, you go.
- It's raining. No thanks.
It's only drizzling.
See how it's held down...
...and if it'll fit
through the window.
Here's a fiver. Buy some stamps.
Just make like you're buying them.
And bring the money back.
Thanks.
- Next.
You wanna go out with me?
- What?
My name's llkka.
Want to go out for a coffee?
Are you for real?
I want to get to know you better.
- Okay.
Okay. Meet you at the TS at seven.
- It's the ST. Seven's okay.
ST at seven. Okay.
How'd it go?
- Really well.
Well then?
- Oh yeah.
Hi.
- Hi.
I can't make.
I'm working tonight.
Oh. How about later tonight then?
Yeah, uh... no,
I have to work all night.
How about Friday?
- Sounds good.
Oh yeah, I need stamps.
- How many? - Seven.
That'll be three fifty.
- Here you go.
Pull the cable in through the
window. The wall will give away.
I didn't notice any alarms.
- It doesn't mean there aren't any.
There's four of us.
Two can be lookouts.
You take the truck.
I'll take the tractor.
The taxis will sound an alarm.
- I'll take care of the taxis.
Give the fiver back to Eero.
What's that?
I need two taxis
to the dance hall.
Great, thanks.
Are you and Pirjo going steady?
- I don't know. I guess.
Have you kissed?
- A little bit.
How was it?
- Nice, but hard to explain.
There's definitely more to it than
just pressing your lips together.
There's something more.
Like things inside your head.
Inside your head?
- Car.
Think he would've noticed if
we'd have had the window out.
I've had enough of this.
It's open.
Okay, try it.
It's gonna blow!
German design's
a tough nut to crack.
You'd need a week on it with a
diamond-head drill to open it.
We don't have a drill.
We only have dynamite.
Lose that and
put these in the Volvo.
How much do you think is in there?
- A hundred grand easy.
It's made to store a lot of money.
- Maybe even a half million.
It's gonna blow!
Give every shop-owner a bat. Let
them swing at all dumb-ass crooks.
It wouldn't do any good.
Too many of them need to have
some sense beat into them.
These guys aren't dumb.
Usually crooks copy at least
some of their methods from TV.
Maybe these idiots
don't have a TV.
Each and every idiot
has a TV these days.
This is supposedly the best.
- Okay, let's put it in and see.
You ready?
- Not sure until we try.
Which way?
- Push it in. Window up.
The Terminator.
- What's that mean?
They sure do shoot
and hit each other a lot.
Stealing money could be so
much simpler that that.
Maybe they just like
shooting at things.
Those sunglasses sure are cool.
No reason to drive the old
Volvo anymore.
I have an idiot-proof plan for
laundering our money. The lottery.
Everyone plays the lottery, but no
one ever really wins. And why?
They play with a chump-change so
there's no chance of winning.
We can play with, let's say,
a thousand dollars.
Our chances of winning would be
a thousand times better.
Which is?
- This week it's three million.
It's a little more than what we
scored at the post office.
So we take the money we
robbed and play the lottery.
Then we live on the winnings.
It's an easy system. I'm amazed
no one's thought of it before.
This is cool. Where'd you get it?
- We won the lottery.
No way.
- No way then.
People are saying things.
- What people?
Everyone thinks you're weird.
- What about you?
I don't know. I don't think
I know you anymore.
How about now?
- Very funny. Kiss me.
Help! What's that?
- You said you wanted a kitten.
But everyone's going to be home.
- Don't worry about my parents.
Hi! No one's home.
You box?
- No. My big brother did.
He died a couple years ago but
I didn't want to give that away.
I felt if I gave it away, I'd be
accepting the fact that he's gone.
Our mother died three years ago.
We still have all her things.
You still have your dad.
- Unfortunately.
What do you mean?
- Our dad's a little... sick.
He's mentally, you know...
Mentally ill.
And not just a little.
It's been rough.
My dad's sick too.
He's such a workaholic.
He thinks the world's going to end
if he's not on duty.
What do you want to be when
you grow up?
I always told my parents I want to
be something artsy.
It was just to agitate them.
Like a rock singer or an actor.
How about you?
- I don't know.
Hard to imagine being an adult.
I haven't even had a childhood.
Tell me when your childhood's over
so I can kiss you.
Okay, it's over.
Pirjo, we're home.
Is Aulis here?
Come on.
Hi, I'm Tuulikki, Pirjo's mom.
This is my husband.
Hi, I'm Ensio.
- Uh, Eero.
Aren't you one of
the Takkunen boys?
Yeah, the youngest one.
Yes, I remember. I came by your
house. Be careful with Pirjo.
She tries to be wilder than she is.
- Dad!
Stop it, you two.
- Only kidding. Just try to behave.
I got a cat.
- Isn't it cute. What's it's name?
Niilo.
- Niilo?
Uhuh. Would you like coffee?
- No. I need to get going.
I promised my brothers
we'd fill out some forms.
Hi. You want a soda or something?
- No thanks, nothing for me.
Something happen?
- Yeah, something's happened.
Our post office was robbed.
Half the wall was torn out.
It's under repairs for three
months so they cut my hours.
Some lazy idiot won't get a job,
and then ruins someone else's job.
I'm sorry.
- It wasn't your fault.
Now I can't pay my rent.
- If you want, I can pay it.
No, thanks.
You're really nice.
You're the first boy to look me in
the eyes, not my boobs.
I can't start a relationship now.
I need to get my affairs in order.
...and thirty-tw o. Bonus numbers
are six, fifteen and tw enty.
So, what'd we get?
Sixty-six euros?
- No, there's a mistake somewhere.
The only mistake is us giving all
that money back to the government.
374 lottery coupons. It has to add
up to more than that.
Let's check them again.
You check them. I've never slaved
away like this in my life.
Sixty-six euros.
Matti... This is so typical.
Hey, listen! A wise head causes
the whole body suffering.
We're going to be the laughing
stock of the whole town.
They don't need to know.
Everyone's going to find out.
But they don't need to know
that we didn't win.
They know that we played a lot and
suddenly we have a pile of money.
It could work.
But we don't have a pile of money
anymore and now we need more.
You spent all our money on this?
- Yeah, but it's not that simple.
Watch out.
It's not so simple.
Oh lord...
Lord, what can I do
with those boys?
They've turned their backs on me.
Who's' the father of the rain?
Don't talk crap.
You're just hearing things.
I know what I know when I know it.
They're just boys.
I can hit them smack in the face
without the blink of an eye.
I've been to easy on them.
You whore.
Don't worry,
I'll set them straight.
Step on it!
- Everyone on board?
Oh my lord.
- Punch the gas!
You wouldn't think a van
could move that fast.
This is living.
Push it to a hundred.
Winch him in.
We can't get him in. Let's stop.
This is a good place to stop.
- We're not stopping.
Let's run into the forest.
They won't find us in there.
This is the police. Stop or we'll
set the police dog loose.
Sick 'em, boy!
Look, it's Tarzan.
Boys, I do believe I've found
the lord again.
Nothing beats this feeling.
It's over. Ilkka got caught.
- He did, huh?
Last I saw him, he fell and
the police dog attacked him.
It's only a matter of time until
they come for the rest of us.
It's a sign from god.
He's telling us
he's tired of us doing this.
Or Maybe we just got caught.
Sometimes you sound so much
like your dad it's scary.
He's your dad too.
My dad threatened to hang me up
and put a power saw to my crotch.
You ever wonder why he's the one
who's allowed to hit anyone?
He knew that someday we'd be a
lot stronger than him.
So it's the wise ones
who do the hitting?
I didn't mean it like that.
You want to hit me then?
- I didn't say that.
You talk and talk, but you don't
have much to say. Say something.
Stop it. We have enough problems
without you two fighting.
Maybe the dog didn't catch llkka.
- It did. Let's call him Trooper.
He is officially a police officer.
The post office bandits
are taunting us.
Baseball bats are what we need.
Policemen don't carry bats.
Not here and not in the big city.
These baboons only
understand violence.
My son boxed and he was tough.
Then he ran into a
tougher guy with a knife.
Eero sure has a nice scooter.
- Yep.
What's he do for as living?
- Nothing. They won the lottery.
You know how improbable it is
to win the lottery?
Yeah, it's as rare as being born
in our precious country.
Why don't you stop acting
like a baby for just a minute.
And why don't you stop acting
like a cop for just a minute.
You play with fire long enough,
you're bound to burn your fingers.
Yes sir, constable, sir.
Hi, what shall it be?
Uh, three tubs of cottage cheese.
- Two... and three.
Fruit salad. Two cans.
Is fruit cocktail all right?
- Yeah.
Anything else?
- Got any odor-eaters?
How many?
- Three.
Just got one left.
And panty liners.
- Say what?
Panty liners.
- They're in the back. Hold on.
You crazy?
- What?
Is there any sense to that?
- No, I guess not.
If you get caught, all hell's
gonna break loose.
Wake up! Don't you see that
we don't care?
You have Pirjo. Ilkka has his dog.
We have this.
It's gonna blow.
- Morons.
I'm getting fed up
with your whining.
Do you always have to
go against the grain?
There's an order to
things in the world.
I could put you in order
if you want.
Why don't you be like dad
and go get the whip.
Guys.
- What?
Okay.
Eero.
- Yeah?
Let's not do this.
Let's go shopping.
Only if we don't buy
anything sensible.
I wouldn't think of it. And if I
did, the feeling would pass.
Three post office robberies.
They have alarms in the big city.
Here it takes 90 minutes to get
a car on the scene.
We don't have the manpower.
It has to be the Russian mafia.
One crew couldn't hit
so many places.
I think the Russian mob likes
doing jobs in bigger cities.
These are local boys
who know the area.
A crime league is moving through
the area, robbing local banks.
An alarm sounded and w e
immediately rushed to the scene.
We saw four men
flee across that field.
You had a police dog w ith y ou.
- Yes. He w as trained for this.
What happened to the dog?.
He pursued the suspect as he'd
been trained, but never returned.
Four masked, apparently foreigners,
are thought to be in the area.
Ilkka, they think
you're a foreigner.
Guys, could you leave me a couple?
I hope you know you're going to
hell for what you're about to do.
Hey, what's that boat?
We're repairing it
for some tycoon.
It's sweet.
I tried to make you some food,
but it didn't really come out.
I didn't come over to eat.
I wanted the evening to be normal.
A night like normal people have.
I want it to be unique.
Unlike anything else.
You think this is unique enough?
- Oh yeah. Very unique.
You could've drained the juices
before mixing them.
You remembered my favorite food.
It was nothing.
Eero just went inside.
This is so wrong.
We're stuck out here in the boat
and he has the house to himself.
It's only one night.
You're just jealous.
You ever thought about marriage?
If it happens, it happens.
I want a woman who loves to run.
I'd run with her
and raise a family.
What do you know
about a real family?
It's not hard to realize what this
world should really be like.
There should be a law
that nobody hits anybody.
People should hug more.
Everyone should clean up after
themselves and not lie.
You should wash your hands before
supper, not after.
What?
- You should. It's common sense.
Never mind.
- You're so...
I'm what?
- You know.
I wonder what Eero's doing.
- What do you think?
Washing his hands.
- You are jealous.
You know what?
I think I'll get married first.
Then I'll practice pre-mari...
marital relations.
Okay.
You feel uncomfortable?
- No.
Did you get some?
You scared?
Yeah, but I want you so much I
can't even think of being scared.
I want you too.
- Yeah.
Oopsidaisy.
What was that?
- Eero being an animal.
That's the sound of a person
losing their innocence.
Let's go watch!
- No way. That's their business.
That doesn't sound normal.
- That's because it's our Eero.
Hey, listen.
No, dad, don't.
Dad, stop.
He's crazy.
A religious man shares his wealth.
- Eero, he's your father.
He who strikes his father is
going to bout in hell.
I've been in hell all my life.
Boy, you don't know
anything about hell.
He who gave you life
can also take it away.
You're a whore of a man.
- Look who's talking.
Mail robber.
Let go.
Call it off, llkka or I'll kill it.
Come here, Trooper. Sit.
The stash is empty.
- Where's the money?
That's the money the
government owes me.
That's our money!
They have the government's stamp
and the government owes me money.
Let's call the police and accuse
him of attempted rape.
First cop who comes in is going
to hear about your mail robbing.
Judas.
- Ilkka, get that dog out of here.
Hey, my favorite.
How'd you know?
You all eat already?
A mouse has a mouse's appetite
and an elephant an elephant's.
Hi.
- Get lost.
No need to tell me what's going on
but I'm here if you want to talk.
I'm doing fine by myself.
I know. I just mean that you
don't have to tell me.
Adversity doesn't always
make you stronger.
Sometimes it just makes
you harder inside.
Yeah yeah.
Would you have wanted me to
die instead of Jyrki?
What are you talking about?
You always keep on
talking about him...
...but you never care where
I'm at and who I'm with.
I don't know how to be a boy,
but I've tried.
We thought you'd run away
if I ordered you around.
It's not caring if you don't say
anything about anything.
Or if something about everything.
It's hard being a dad these days.
That's a good boy. Good dog.
Lord, set me free of these chains.
I'll sacrifice this innocent,
furry little fuck to you.
Instead of doing little jobs,
let's do one big one.
Then we can go on vacation.
Or we could buy our own house.
- Or get dad his own nurse.
What he needs is a guard.
Who would take care
of him if not us?
He's doing just fine on his own.
- Concentrate on the job, guys.
Okay, but this is the last one.
- Okay.
The bank has a space
between the roof and ceiling.
We can get in through there.
It's a bank, not a post office.
- One of us stays on lookout.
Pound on the aluminum if
you see something.
Here we go. Who's first?
You. - No, you. - No, you.
Okay, llkka, you're first then.
Hello?
- Hi.
I haven't heard from you lately.
I was afraid to call.
Everything got so messed up.
Don't you want to see me anymore?
Of course I do, but I thought you
had enough after meeting my dad.
I don't want to talk about it.
I know what I'm going to be
when I grow up. A policeman.
You still there?
- Yeah. That sounds good.
What are you doing for Christmas?
- I don't know.
Spend it with me.
- I don't think so.
So much is going on
with my dad and all.
Maybe we should take a break.
Oh. - Just so we can get
things in order.
Is there someone else?
- No. I'll tell you when I see you.
Dad woke up. I have to go.
Call me.
Goodbye.
That's definitely a hole.
- I'm going in.
Find anything?
- Oh yes.
Bank deposit forms.
This is a paper storage.
You think the crook's are
getting dumber?
You never know if they had
an acute need for forms.
Let's go pick up those
monkey-brained little shits.
We'd keep them for four days. Then
they'd go destroy the evidence.
Should we set up a watch here.
Crooks only come back to the
crime scene in the movies.
How about I measure
the paces this time?
Oh boy. - Is there a lower
ceiling underneath?
Steel plate.
Sledge hammers won't do.
Dynamite. - Dynamite.
Dyma... Dynamite!
We've had false alarms before.
These American gadgets don't hold
up in these freezing temperatures.
We could also make a
new year's resolution.
But first we spend like crazy.
Then we find redemption and pray.
I wish the owner would come from
The Canaries and answer the alarm.
Couldn't find anything except
that alarm beeping in there.
I don't know about this. How much
money does a person need?
We could sell all our new junk
and live well for six months.
This new year we could promise
to never steal anything again.
It's time find redemption, boys.
Does redemption pay the bills
Or put gas in the gas tank?
Or food on the table?
Money won't fall into our laps.
- All I know is blowing things up.
A person has to have something.
It's gonna blow. Fuse is burning.
Even snow falling off the roof
like that can set off the alarm.
I just wish this wouldn't happen
on Christmas eve.
What's going on?
- Nothing. Let's go home.
Nothing? Damn it!
Hey Trooper. I'm pappy Jokke.
I have a surprise for you.
Dust to dust...
...and so on.
Put some more dynamite in there.
- We'll need twice as much.
Heh, it's gonna blow.
You have to go to the hospital.
- And he'd end up in prison.
I don't think it's broken.
I'll sew it up at home.
Guys, take a look.
Guys, this must be it.
Merry Christmas, boys. Mop up the
floor and take out the garbage.
What have you done?
Woof.
Dog's don't have souls.
- Do you?
The lord works in mysterious ways.
Eero, bring me that bag.
- Money's your only lord.
You have no right
talking like that.
You whored with
that cop's daughter.
Give me the money.
- Pirjo isn't a whore.
He who whores is a whore.
What else could I expect
from a whore's son?
Give me the money and
make it snappy.
Dad, mom wasn't a whore.
Oh, she wasn't?
- No.
Ever wonder why your name is Otto?
Ever wonder why the other boys
are so much younger than you?
What are you talking about?
Your mom made you with a slick
salesman with a queer moustache.
He's working as a professional
pussy in Sweden these days.
You don't know
what you're talking about.
You're the one who slept around.
You were all born in sin and
you know what happens to sinners.
You're lying.
Why are you lying, dad?
Go cry to your real daddy,
goddammit.
Give me the money now.
Eero, has the money made you happy?
- No.
And you, Matti?
- No.
That money hasn't made us happy.
You think it'll make you happy?
Hello! Hello!
It's my money.
Try to understand that
the government owes it to me.
What are you going to do with it?
- I have running expenses.
What expenses?
I'm gonna burn a lot of cash and
spend some quality time.
What's it to you?
If it's our dad's dream, his sons
should realize his dream.
Okay, dad.
Shall we burn some money?
Burn me and you'll go to hell.
The whole lot of you are crazy.
Matti, look at what your
brothers are doing.
You mean taking money out
of this bag and burning it?
Oh dear god, don't you realize
that you're burning real money?
I never burned money before so
I don't know what it looks like.
Okay, boys. I'll do anything
if you'll stop burning that cash.
Anything?
- Anything.
We want our childhood back.
- No. No!
A rare event occurred
over the holiday s.
A father turned his four sons in
to the police for a bank robbery.
The boy s are also responsible for
a spree of gas station robberies.
These "Dalton brothers" have been
charged w ith 94 counts of...
...robbery or attempted robbery.
Some people think even jail time
isn't enough for these boy s.
What's going to happen to them?
- A pardon is out of the question.
Jail time w ill do the boy s good.
Try to do well in college.
- No games with matchboxes.
Come see us on your vacations.
I'll bring blueberries and flour
so You won't forget your roots.
Well, well, well,
if it isn't my little robbers.
What, are you all turning your
backs on your daddy?
I refuse to stay poor. You're not
taking a single bag with you.
I know you didn't burn the money.
Nobody's that crazy. I'll find it.
Fuck you, old man.
Let's go. I'd rather sit in prison
than listen to his preaching.
Can you drop me off at a bus stop?
- That shouldn't be a problem.
Go ahead. - No, you. - No, you.
- This is going to be a long trip.
Hurry up, you baboons.
We don't have all day.
There's no hurry.
We do have all day.
Goddammit, I want that money.
I'm not getting riled up for free.
Where's that damn money?
Oh yes. Thank you.
Oopsidaisy.
Please, lord, help me now.
Forgive me.
Pirjo's going to police academy.
- You lost. Leena's seeing Aulis.
How's your leg?
- Hurts when it rains.
What an Invalid.
- Cripple. - Gimp.
You've never been serious
competition, not even now.
Grab on if you feel faint.
- I'd beat any one of you.
With what, handicapped scooters?
- Let's have a little race then.
To the station.
- That's too short.
Okay, to the gas station then.
- You first.
No, you. - No, you.
Go!
