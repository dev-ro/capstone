Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women,
and blessed is the
fruit of thy womb Jesus,
Holy Mary, Mother of
God, pray for us sinners,
Now and at the
hour of our death.
Amen.
No, no.
No, no, no!
No!
Help!
Aiuto!
Aiuto!
No, no, no!
Aiuto!
Please
help.
No!
Aiuto!
I'm sorry, but how much
longer will this take?
I've got to take
my vows tonight,
and I really can't be late.
Do you speak English?
Sorry for the wait.
It's extra work now
when someone arrives
without a return ticket.
Parli italiano?
I ask if you're
learning Italian.
Oh, I'm trying, but it's a
lot harder than I thought.
Mm.
So this convent, they
bought you the ticket?
Mm-hmm.
You're very young to
be a nun, aren't you?
What a waste.
Look at her.
It's a different life, yeah?
It must have been
a hard decision.
I don't think of it like that,
as a decision.
Very well.
I hope you find what you're
looking for, Sister Cecilia.
Sister Cecilia.
Apologies.
I'm Deacon Enzo. Come with me.
Thank you.
How much longer?
We're almost there.
Right this way, Sister Cecilia.
Sister Cecilia!
Reverend Mother.
Your eyes radiate the
light of the Holy Spirit.
Like the angels delivered you
straight from the heavens.
We've been eagerly awaiting
your arrival, my dear.
I'm sorry.
She says you're pretty.
Grazie. I'm Sister Cecilia.
Isabelle.
Isabelle, will you please
show Cecilia to her room?
I have to help our sisters get
ready for tonight's celebration.
Mind your place and do as I ask!
Let me show you to your room.
Our Lady of Sorrows
was founded in 1632
as a refuge for elder sisters
before their
transition to heaven.
- It's really beautiful.
- Yes, it is.
Buongiorno, sorelle.
And we work hard to
keep it that way.
Our sister's final
days should be
a pleasing environment
to help distract from all
the sickness and suffering.
All of this, it was built on
the catacomb of St. Stephen.
Catacombs?
It's off limits.
Hello, Sisters.
This is our new
novice, Sister Cecilia.
Ciao.
The one in the wheelchair,
her tumor has metastasized.
So we expect her to meet
God by the end of the week.
You talk about it so casually.
Death is a part of
everyday life here.
Have you seen my daddy?
Yes, let's go find
him, shall we?
It's best to just play
along with their delusions
unless they get violent.
Be careful of this
one. She bites.
I'm sorry.
Living quarters
for the caretakers
are down there and upstairs.
Morning prayer begins at 5:00
a.m., communal meal is after.
And if you have any
dietary restrictions,
we cannot accommodate them.
And this room is yours.
Thank you, sister.
I feel honored to
serve alongside you.
You're very sweet.
Thank you.
I don't mean that
as a compliment.
I'm sure this must
feel very romantic,
but this is our life.
And I promise you, work is hard,
physically and emotionally.
So if you're here to find
yourself, there are easier ways.
I'm not.
Tonight, you do not
have to take your vows.
You can still go back,
and God will forgive you.
I think he has
sufficiently prepared me.
The ceremony will start
at 1700 in the chapel.
Don't be late.
- Oh, ciao.
- Ciao.
I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.
I'm Cecilia.
Oh, I'm Guendalina.
You can call me Gwen.
My room is there.
Where in the States
are you from?
Just outside of
Detroit, Michigan.
Mm-hmm.
Are you from around here or...
Closer to Milan.
You're far from home.
Yeah, my parish closed.
- Did the priest get in trouble?
- No.
No, no, no, no, no, no,
nothing, nothing like that.
Just low attendance.
And that church was
my family, my home.
Leaving, I felt pretty lost.
But then Father Tedeschi,
he reached out to me.
Yeah.
He has a talent.
Sniffing out broken birds.
Oh, I didn't want to offend you.
I think that maybe we are
all head cases or runaways.
Which one are you?
Both.
Next time if you want,
you can lock the door.
Thanks.
Sister Cecilia.
Father Tedeschi, it's nice
to meet you in person.
We all feel so blessed
to have you here.
How's the Italian coming along?
Comme ci, com me ci.
It's fine.
I will translate for you.
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Let us rejoice, for the
marriage of the Lamb has come,
and his brides have
made themselves ready.
Sorella Cecilia.
Sister Cecilia.
Do you promise to follow Christ
more closely by
living a life devoid
of material possessions?
Do you promise to free
yourself from the demands
of a human relationship
and follow with joy
when he shall come again
a vow of poverty,
chastity, and obedience?
I do.
May God give you the
strength to fulfill your vows
faithfully and joyfully.
May you shine his light
for the world to see.
How are you feeling?
Full.
Yeah, we don't... we
don't really have anything
like this back home.
Cecilia, this is your home.
I know, I know.
I felt the same way
when I started here.
I didn't grow up
wanting to be a priest.
My first career was
in sciences, biology.
I was almost two decades
in, and I couldn't
understand the world
any better than back
when I was in Sunday school.
And then God showed me a path.
He brought me here.
This is where I was meant to be.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Two glasses in and I can't
stop talking about myself.
I'm so sorry.
- No, it's OK.
It's OK.
- What about you?
I imagine it was a
difficult decision.
I mean, yes, it
seemed so far away.
But the opportunities
back in the States,
I didn't feel like that's
what God saved me for.
If it's too personal...
No.
When I was 12 years
old, there was this part
of the Saginaw River that
would always freeze over.
And no matter how
cold it was, I would
always walk out onto the ice.
And I would do this thing
where I took my gloves off,
and I would place my
hands right on the ice.
And I would hold them there
until I couldn't feel anything.
I don't remember
the ice breaking.
I just, I remember this
sharp pain of cold.
The paramedics, they
tried to revive me,
but my heart stopped for
almost seven minutes.
That sounds terrifying.
I know God saved
me for a reason,
but I guess I'm still searching
for what that reason is.
Now will you... will
you excuse me, please?
Ciao?
Are you OK?
I'll go get some help.
Cecilia.
Reverend Mother, I'm so sorry.
I heard her crying and...
It's OK.
Sometimes we get
caught up in emotion.
You have a question.
All right.
What is this place?
Saint Helena, Mother
of Constantine
brought this back
from Jerusalem.
Here.
He suffered on the cross.
Suffered? This is the...
Yes.
For you. For us. For our
sins. For our salvation.
We suffer.
In the name of His love.
It is a gift.
Suffering is love.
Are you alright, Sister?
In the name of the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.
It's been three days
since my last confession.
I was...
I was careless last night.
I must have drank too much
wine and embarrassed myself
in front of Mother Superior.
I promise to carry myself with
grace because I want nothing
more than to belong here.
I'm afraid I've already
messed things up.
I'm sorry for these...
Yearnments.
Hello?
Good morning, Sisters.
Today a new life begins.
But this new year
will not be easy.
You will question your purpose.
You will question me and
why you have come here.
And some of you will not have the
spiritual fortitude for this life.
What did she say?
God is good. God is great.
God, my head hurts.
Too much blood of Christ?
Do you find this amusing,
Sister Guendalina?
No, forgive me.
This side of the
room is with me.
The other, will serve
with Sister Isabelle.
No.
What a blessing to
mentor you both.
Finish eating. We
have work to do.
Looks like her vibrator
ran out of battery.
What does that mean?
Oh, nothing. I really like her.
I'm super excited.
Clean their back thoroughly.
And if the consistency
of their feces seems off,
you let Dr. Gallo know.
Ciao.
All: Ciao.
We want to hang the larger
items towards the front
and the shorter items
towards the back.
That way, the wind can
blow underneath it.
First you have to make sure
your knife is nice and sharp.
Otherwise you run the
risk of making a big mess.
I'm sorry. I can't.
In the name of the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
Blessed.
Saint.
All of us adore you.
Sister, let's...
let's get you to bed.
Blessed Saint Cecilia.
Buonanotte, sister.
It could have been worse.
She could have given you bangs.
Gwen, I'm not joking.
She had scars on the
bottom of her feet.
It's not what you thought it
would be, huh, this place?
No, it's definitely different.
It's better than where
I came from, though.
What do you mean?
There is a boy.
There was a boy, I mean.
What happened with this boy?
He hit me.
I hit him back.
Once I left him,
I went to those support
groups, you know?
There were these nuns there.
And I thought, these women
have a very good life.
They have a place to live, a job
where they can keep
their clothes on,
nothing to worry about.
So I signed up.
Wait, so you don't
even believe in God?
Of course I do.
Life is so cruel.
Only a man can be responsible.
Oh, my God, I was joking.
Are you OK?
I don't feel good.
I'm going to call a doctor.
Sister Cecilia. Come with me.
Your Eminence.
Sit.
Could you please tell
Cardinal Merola your vows?
- My vows?
- Your vows.
I swore to three
vows when I got here,
of obedience,
poverty, and chastity.
- He's asking if you have...
- I understand.
I have.
I have been obedient,
your Eminence.
Have you kept your vow of
poverty? Yes, I, I own nothing.
I want for nothing.
Have you remained chaste?
I'm sorry, why are
you asking me this?
It's OK.
Just answer the question,
if you would, Cecilia.
Of course, I've been
chaste, your Eminence.
Before you arrived, did you
have congress with a man?
Congress with... no, no.
Have you ever had
congress with a man?
I've not broken my vows. I've never
been with a man or a woman, nobody.
You'll not be punished. We
just want to know the truth.
I'm not lying, Father.
What is going on?
When she arrived, Dr. Gallo,
did you examine her?
Her hymen was intact.
It's never been touched.
What are they saying?
Mother Superior, have we had
visitors during these last few weeks?
No.
What are you... what
are you looking at?
One last time.
Have you ever had
sexual intercourse?
Why are you asking me this?
You are with child.
This child was
conceived without sin.
As God as my witness
we have been blessed
with a miracle.
He believes you.
It's a miracle.
Out of all the women in the
world, why did he choose me?
You told me who saved your life,
who sent you on the
path that led you here.
Cecilia, you've been
searching for a reason.
God saved you.
This is it.
Blessed are the meek,
for they shall
inherit the Earth.
No working.
Remember, your only job is baby.
How long before they
start calling you Mary?
It was supposed
to be me! Bitch!
Isabelle! Isabelle!
Sisters!
Stop it!
Leave her alone!
Stop!
No! No, no!
We have to try again!
They have to try again with me!
They have to try again with me!
Heartbeat is stable.
There's no bleeding.
Praise be.
We'll run some blood tests
to check for distress.
But he appears to be OK.
But I'm not OK.
Father, Isabelle said it
was supposed to be her.
Why would she say that?
Well, Isabelle has been losing
her battle with mental
illness for a while now.
And seeing you and the miracle,
it clearly triggered something,
whether it be jealousy...
She tried to drown me.
You're right. You're right.
And I'll make sure this
never happens again.
I want to see another doctor.
Why? Dr. Gallo...
Takes care of old women.
I want to go to a
real hospital, please.
He's a licensed obstetrician.
Thursday through Saturdays I
deliver babies at Cosentino.
A hospital is not what you need
right now. You're perfectly healthy.
I just puked up one of my teeth.
Hospitals aren't the
safest of places.
We wouldn't want
you to get sick.
Or for the word to
get out, you know.
The safest thing
is for you to stay
here until the Savior is born.
Bless you, young mother.
Oh, Isabelle.
All of you, go.
Go away, I said!
Cecilia, you need to
stand up for yourself.
- Gwen, shh.
- Open your eyes.
I don't trust this place.
I don't think we can just leave.
Cecilia, you're five
months pregnant,
and you haven't even
been to a hospital.
We can take care of this.
How can we trust
what's inside you?
Maybe God is...
God has nothing to do with this.
Sisters, is something the
matter? I can see you...
Don't touch me.
Fuck this.
How the fuck can you just stand
there as if nothing happened?
Cecilia's pregnant
and we don't know how.
Isabelle killed herself.
What the fuck is going on?
Sorella...
Let go of me! I know when
a man is lying to me.
And all of you, every single one
of you, is so full of bullshit!
Let go of me! Let go of me!
Let go of me!
No!
Let go of me! I said let me go!
{\an8}"For Satan himself
often masquerades
{\an8}as an angel of light."
Gwen.
Gwen.
No!
No, no!
Let me go! Let me go!
No.
No, I'm begging you, please.
Shh.
Blessed...
Santa.
Please help me.
We have to leave.
You will never leave here.
What's happening?
I don't know.
Mother! What's going on?
I don't know, father.
God in Heaven.
- Call Doctor Gallo.
- It's not possible, it's Saturday.
Call him!: Something's wrong.
I won't get a hold of him, it's Saturday.
We need to get her to the hospital.
- No.
- You must go. Now.
- No.
- That's it, I'm calling an ambulance.
Stop!
Something's wrong.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
I don't.
I don't want to die.
What do we do if she
dies on the way there?
We must maintain hope.
It ain't looking good.
Then we shall pray.
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
I understand.
Stop the car.
What?
Stop the car.
What are you...
what are you doing?
Go!
Go, go!
Clean yourself.
Clean yourself.
Now you're ashamed?
Now?
Where was your shame when you stuffed
a dead animal inside yourself?
Shame on you.
Making us believe the
miracle died inside you.
What do you have to
say for yourself?
God will never forgive you.
I want to apologize
if any of my actions
made you feel scared.
And I want to reassure
you that you're safe.
What did you do to me?
When you look at
this, what do you see?
Some people might
see just an old piece
of iron, a rusty nail.
For those of us who know,
we see proof of
Jesus' sacrifice,
a symbol of his suffering.
And for 2,000 years,
that's all it was.
But we looked closer,
and we found blood,
tissue, little
fragments of bone,
a genetic code.
All we had to do was crack it
the key to resurrection.
You're insane.
Let me show you.
It's taken us 20 years
of trial and error,
20 years for God to deliver
unto us the knowledge
and the perfect fertile vessel.
Is this what's inside me?
No.
These are all our failures.
What's inside you
is our success.
I left the field of
genetics because some people
disagreed with the
ethics of my experiment.
So many people have such a
narrow view of its potential.
But here in the
church, here they
understood that a
simple procedure
could bring us salvation.
You're playing God.
I am not playing God.
Do you know what it's like
to watch the miracle die
in the womb, to fail God
again and again and again,
but find the strength
to keep going?
This is my calling.
And this, this is yours.
No.
What are you doing?
What's... what's going on?
What is that?
What are you...
what are you doing?
Please stop. Stop,
stop, stop, stop.
Please, please, stop. Stop!
May you never stray again.
No. No, no!
Stop!
Blessed are the meek...
No, no, no. Please no.
- For they shall inherit...
- No, no, no, no, please, no.
- The Earth.
- No, no!
No!
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Sister Cecilia.
How long have you
been targeting me?
Please, si confessi.
Was it since the accident?
What's going to
happen when it's done?
You think it's gonna,
what, save the world?
End it?
That's what revelation
says, right?
This is not God's work.
Very well.
If this is not the will of God,
why does God not stop us?
Any day now.
Hm.
He's moving.
Ah.
I'll be right back
with her medication.
Would you care to?
Yes!
I'll be right back.
Such a beautiful mother. And
those eyes. Like sunflowers.
Blessed child
it's all part of His plan.
You will save us.
Blessed are the meek, for
they shall inherit the earth.
God damn it.
Oh my God.
Cecilia, what have you done?
Cecilia, this won't
solve anything.
If you die, we'll find another.
You can end this.
All you need to do is
deliver our savior.
No!
No!
Cecilia.
Cecilia.
Let go of me!
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among
women, and blessed
is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary...
No, no!
Mother of God, pray
for us sinners...
Now and at the hour...
No.
Fuck you.
