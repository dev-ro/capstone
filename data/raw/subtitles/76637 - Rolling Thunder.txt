Major, I sure do hate to face
All them people.
Put your glasses on.
[Crowd cheering]
[Band playing]
Welcome home.
Hello.
Welcome home.
Welcome home.
Welcome home, major.
Major rane, I'm sure e
Crowd would like to hear you say
A few words.
It's good to be back.
We knew all along that everyone
Back home from the president on
Down was behind us 100%.
With God and faith and our
Families kept us going.
Speaking for myself, I would
Like to say the whole experience
Has made a better man, better
Officer and a better American
Out of me.
Thank you very much.
[Cheering]
Wish you a lot of luck.
Thank you, sir.
Right over this way.
Hi, daddy.
Hello, son.
How are you?
Fine.
Honey!
Oh, baby, it's good to have you
Back.
We have been looking forward to
This day.
Oh, I'm so glad you're home.
There is my boy!
Major rane, how do you feel
About being back after seven
Years?
Do you have any bitterness
Toward the anti-war movement?
Charlie?
I was so nervous that cliff came
By to drive us out.
You remember cliff.
How are you doing, cliff?
It's good to see you.
Jesus Christ you're looking
Good.
Let's get you out of here, okay?
Excuse me.
Not over here, get back with
Your daddy.
Let's move it, come on.
Major.
We made it.
We're home.
Take care of yourself.
You're going to be fine.
Oh, yeah.
If you ever get out to El Paso.
I'll be there.
Take care.
Aren't you glad your daddy's
Home?
Sure.
Remember what the doctor
Said, it will take a while for
You two to get to know each
Other, but you will.
Why is he staying out in the
Work shed?
Because it's small and quiet
Out there.
Charlie, come in.
That's a real pretty shotgun
You got me for a present.
Thank you.
Cliff helped me pick it out.
Says it's as good as they come.
Sleep tight.
Well, that was real nice of
Cliff.
Maybe you and I can go out and
Take target practice with it,
What do you say?
Okay.
We'll do it.
You get some sleep.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Where did you find that?
In the living room.
Mom said it was yours.
It's all right.
I just didn't know you had it.
I carried that around with me
For a long time.
We didn't get to see the
American flag very often.
In jail?
Jail, well, I guess so, yeah.
I made that myself.
I collect little pieces of
Thread and cloth and it took
A long time.
But I made it.
Every morning all the men in my
Compound would come in.
That little thing?
That thing.
Sometimes we would whisper the
"Star spangled banner."
Do you remember?
I mean, what I looked like when
I was a baby?
Sure.
Of course I do.
Every last detail.
Why don't you take that as
A present from me.
Thanks.
You don't remember me, do
You?
Well, there is no reason why you
Should.
When I left, you were only about
That big.
About 18 months old.
You knew your daddy then, mark.
You knew me.
Last thing I remember just
Before I was getting on the
Plane to go overseas was you
Toddling up toward me saying
Daddy, daddy.
You were are a tough little guy.
Why don't you get some sleep,
Son.
Good night, daddy.
Did you leave the night light
On?
He can't sleep without it.
Seems a little confused.
He has been that way for
Weeks.
A 104 degree fever for three
Day, vomiting, diarrhea.
The doctor says it's nothing
Organic, it's just nerves.
A problem pows.
Among others.
You didn't change the house
Much, did you?
Didn't change a thing.
Back pay.
I didn't touch a penny of.
It as soon as I found out you
Were alive.
Alive?
Well, in the prison camp.
Whatever you call it.
Any way, I was okay.
I decided to leave it in the
Bank for you to do what you
Wanted with it.
That's real nice.
I got you a present.
A special one.
I hope you remember.
Mounds.
Remember how we used to eat
Them when we were first
Together.
I had one of those in my
Flight jacket the day I went
Down.
I tried to save it.
I took a little bite out of it
Every day for 6 months.
Oh, Charlie.
You changed your hair.
Yeah.
About 100 times in the last
Three weeks.
And you're not wearing
A brassiere.
Nobody wears them any more.
Did they tell you that?
No.
They told us about mini-skirts,
But never thought we would get
To see one.
I have one, you want me to
Try it on?
No, you don't have to do
That.
Charlie, I have been with
Another man.
Aren't you going to say
Anything?
You just going to sit there?
Charlie, I didn't know when you
Were coming back or if you ever
Would.
I tell you, the men around here
Don't respect anything.
I told you all the guys that
Called me up, a lot of your
Friends from the base.
I didn't even look at them.
And then cliff, he and Peggy
Split and she took the kids to
California and cliff started
Coming over, playing with mark
And fixing things up around the
House.
He didn't make a pass at me.
I mean, he didn't at all.
I knew what he wanted, but he
Never did anything about it.
And then it just seemed like the
Two of us had to.
We knew.
We all knew.
Couldn't have been any other
Way.
Cliff asked me to marry him,
Charlie.
And I said I would.
I don't think I'm up for any
More of this.
Why don't you go to bed.
I'll work this all out.
What are you going to do?
I'm just going to sit here.
[Music]
I can't sleep.
Those pills you gave me don't
Work any more.
After seven years it's going
To take some time to re-adjust.
I had everything worked out,
But nothing is going the way I
Planned.
My wife wants a divorce, but I
Suppose you already knew that.
Uh-huh.
Does that make you angry?
It's important to me that I
Stay close to my son.
I won't let him go.
You don't have to.
Now, no matter what happens,
I won't let him go.
[Applauding]
[Band playing]
All right, folks.
Major rane, to help you travel
On the road to success in style,
We are proud to present to you
The keys to that Cadillac
Convertible.
Thank you very much.
[Applauding]
And as a special
Presentation, the young Texas
Bell who wore your bracelet
While you were away, miss Linda
Forchet.
Linda?
Major, I have been looking
Forward to the day I would be
Giving this back to you.
Thank you very much.
[Applauding]
And grimes department store
Would like to present you with
A token of our respect,
Admiration and hope for the
Future.
One silver dollar you were in
Honoi's h... hole.
And one for good luck.
Thank you very much.
What will you do with all the
Silver dollars?
I will take them home and
Hide them.
You should try talking to
Charlie about it.
What should I tell him?
I'm sorry they shot your dad and
Tortured him.
I'm sorry I'm taking your
Family away from you.
Sure didn't want it to work
Out like this.
I didn't either.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, come on.
Come on.
It's going to be all right.
I'll try talking to him.
I feel so guilty.
Ah!
Chuck it over here.
Now over to your dad.
No, no.
You guys go ahead.
I'm beat.
Buy you a drink?
Sure.
If I am bothering you, just
Tell me to leave.
No, it's all right.
I mean, h..., I wouldn't
Blame you if you came after me
With a d... tire iron or
Something.
Why would I want to do
Something like that?
After everything that's
Happened.
H..., what kind of a man if I
Went and hid without talking
About it?
Welcome home, Charlie.
It's good to be home, cliff.
I got to say this, Charlie.
I really admire you.
Well, thank you, cliff.
I mean, I have been in
Scrapes and I know what I can
Do, well, anyone who wasn't over
There has to ask if he could
Have taken getting tortured and
All.
I mean, them gooks had no mercy.
Well, you don't want to hear
About that, cliff.
No.
No way.
I don't even want to think about
It.
You know, you're lucky.
You're lucky they didn't ruin
You for life.
You want to know what they
Did?
No.
Sure you do.
They had this rope trick.
Yeah?
They were happy with it.
They got you down on your
Knees in front of them like this
And tied your arms behind you,
Like this.
Just help me out.
The that arm to that one real
Close.
Like this?
That's right.
Tighter.
They did it tighter.
You sure you want to go
Through this again, huh,
Charlie?
Of course.
Take the loose ends and pull it
Up in the air like you're going
To take me clear up to the
Ceiling.
Higher, man until you hear the
Bones starting to crack.
Higher!
Come on, higher!
Higher!
All right, Charlie.
That's enough.
They used to do that to us
Twice a day.
I don't know how yotook it.
You learn to love the rope.
That's how you beat them.
That's how you beat people who
Torture you.
Learn to love them.
Then they don't know you're
Beating them.
Listen, cliff, I hope you don't
Mind me saying this to you, but
I really appreciate it if you
Didn't call my kid a runt.
I won't.
Sorry, Charlie.
Here's looking at you.
How are you doing?
What can I do?
Give me $10 worth of premium.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Major rane?
Hi.
Hi.
Linda forchet, the girl who
Wore your bracelet.
I remember, how are you?
Fine.
I like your shirt.
You been shopping?
Yeah.
Come on, I'll buy you
A drink.
I have to get back.
You going to be the first guy
To say no to me?
Come on.
I guess not.
Why don't you hop in and I'll
Park the car.
I work here at night.
What are you doing here now?
Just hanging out.
I come in and water the plants
And socialize.
Bring me a tom Collins.
What do you drink?
I'll have a beer.
You major Charles rane?
Yes, ma'am.
The man's thirsty.
You sure shouldn't be.
The village idiot.
I was hoping to run into you
Like this.
Would you believe that I was
Going to slip you my number that
Day I gave you the dumb silver
Dollars?
You being and married and all,
Whoa babe, get a hold of
Yourself.
Thank you.
This round's on Manny.
Would you thank him, please.
Happy days.
Here's looking at you.
Here's looking at you.
You're the strong, silent type,
Aren't you?
No, I'm just a little rusty
On my small talk.
Hey, I didn't mean anything
Bad.
I don't mind carrying the ball
After all the drunks I have to
Put up with.
I have to be getting back any
Way.
I would like you to thank
Your friends for me.
That was really nice.
I would like to thank you too
For wearing my bracelet all that
Time.
I really appreciate that.
It's the very least I could
Do.
I would like to do more.
Yeah, well.
Come back and see me,
Wednesday through Sunday night.
Sure.
Bye.
Bye.
Major, have a seat.
Hello, major.
Saw you on TV.
You look good.
You really did.
You looked good.
We also saw them give you
A whole s... load of silver
Dollars and the boys and I were
In the neighborhood and thought
You should give us some of those
Silver dollars.
Huh?
Now, if you will just be so
Kind as to tell us where all
That money is, then we can just
Be on our way.
No fuss, no muss.
Ain't gonna do it.
Well, these are mean old boys.
They can make you tell me where
The money is.
Melio?
I didn't hear y, boy.
[Laughing]
Now, you are going to tell us
Where that money is sooner or
Later.
I would suggest sooner.
Because later may be too late.
He ain't cooperating worth
A s...
Sam?
Get him up, melio.
Now, don't give me any of that
Officers hard s...
I was right there in nam laying
Face down in the mud when you
Cats were flying over.
Now what have you got to say?
Rane.
Major Charles w. 3968469.
He's a rough old boy, ain't
He?
This dude's crazy.
He isn't going to do too
Well in the information
Department.
God d... you.
I'll make this mother f... er
Talk.
Fetch him.
[Music]
You ready to talk to us, boy?
I don't think we are going to
Get them silver dollars.
We'll get them.
[Speaking in spanish]
Who are you?
Charlie?
Shut up!
Oh, my God.
Lady, your husband has
A whole bag of silver dollars
And he has them
Hid from me.
I want those silver dollars and
I don't get them, he will die.
No, don't hurt him.
Please don't I know where he
Hid them.
Show me.
You dumb a... hole, how does
It feel to have gone through
All this for nothing?
A hero, he don't work like
That.
Charlie, why didn't you tell
Them?
I'll tell you why, lady.
Because he's macho mother
F... er.
You and t-bird take the wagon
And melio and I will meet you.
Melio?
[Gunfiring]
[Music]
They got new orders for me,
Major.
I wasn't going to reup, but I
Figure I get 10 years and hang
In another 10, I get my check.
All you have to do is collect
Your check.
What am I going to do with 10
Years?
You reup for another 10.
After all, ain't going to dig no
Oil well from your backyard, are
They?
Just one jerk off job is as
Good as another, I guess.
How is your wife?
Real good.
It's hard getting used to home
Life again, you know,
Getting used to being with
A woman.
You want to head back?
Yeah, sure.
Might as well.
Thank you, John.
Pretty slick, ain't it is?
Oh, yeah.
Figure out how to work it yet?
I have been practicing, too.
You ought to get the hang of
It pretty soon.
They will catch them some day.
I suppose.
Can't just let it slide.
They don't have any right to
Live.
Hey, I can come back later.
No, that's all right.
Come on in, sit down.
Linda forchet, this is John
Vohden.
We were together.
Pleased to meet you.
How do you do?
Well, I guess I better get
Going, major.
I have a long drive back to El
Paso.
Thank you for coming.
I'll see you real soon.
Bye, miss.
Bye.
Bye, major.
Take care, John.
I'll put these in some water.
You trying to tell me you
Ain't got anything better to do?
Oh, sure, my life is a mad
World of parties and rich
Boyfriends.
It wouldn't make any difference
What I was doing, I would still
Come see you.
Why?
Got yourself a groupie,
Major.
What's a groupie?
That words after my time.
Well, a groupie is a girl who
Falls in love with a rock star
Or movie star.
Somebody she doesn't know,
Worships him and knows she is
Never going to meet him, but if
She ever does, she will do
Anything for him.
Anything she can.
It's been six weeks.
We are getting nowhere.
I wish you could remember
Something.
A name, a face, an accent.
Anything.
I can't.
You sure about that, Charlie?
I can't even remember how
This happened.
I just came from the
Cemetery.
Took some flowers.
Graves look real nice.
I want to get my hands on them
Murdering bastards.
That will pass, cliff.
Everything passes.
Just sign here.
How are you today?
Fine, how are you?
Taking major home?
That's right.
Thank you.
You all set?
Yeah.
Sure you wouldn't rather stay
At a hotel?
I'm sure.
Pick you up Monday morning at
10:00, okay?
That's fine.
You know, I really do think I
Can help you, Charlie.
I'm sure you can, doc.
I think we will give it our best
Shot on Monday morning.
Why don't you just pull over and
Let me out by the mail box.
See you Monday morning, then,
Huh?
You need help with this bag?
No, I can get it.
[Music]
[Bar music playing]
How are you doing?
Is just going to get mad at
You for not calling.
I'm going to Mexico for a few
Days.
You want to come with me?
When are you leaving?
Now.
I get off at 2:00.
Stick around and have a drink.
I got to go now.
What do you expect me to do,
Just drop everything?
Wednesday was always a slow
Night.
Where are we going?
We are going to head toward
Nuevo laredo.
What is there?
Some people I used to know.
What are we going to do?
Be social.
Okay.
I'm ready.
[Music]
Okay, so what do you want me
To do?
I wish you would come in with
Me.
I will come in right behind
You and surprise them.
[Music]
I'm looking for a guy named
Fat ed.
I don't know anybody by that
Name.
[Speaking in spanish]
I know fat ed.
He is a good friend of mine.
You want to come to him?
He's a friend of a friend.
You want to talk to fat ed?
Stay here.
I will take you to him.
Follow me.
I'm Lopez.
Why do you want to see fat ed?
I told you.
Where is he?
He will be here.
Fat ed likes beautiful gringo
Girls.
I like beautiful gringo girls.
Everybody likes beautiful gringo
Girls.
Fat ed always takes care of his
Friends.
What do you mean?
We share.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
You have the wrong idea.
No, I don't think so.
I do.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Charlie, what the h... is
This?
Wait for me in the car.
She stays here.
Get on your f... ing knees.
Put your hands behind your head.
Put your forehead on the ground.
Don't move.
Now, I want to know where fat ed
Is or I'm going to kill you.
I don't know no fat ed.
I was just lying.
I'm in a hurry.
I don't know, I don't know.
You're telling me you never
Heard of melio, t-bird or
Automatic slim.
Go and ask for Billy Sanchez.
He knows everybody.
I don't know nobody, please,
Mister, please.
You could lose a hand like
That.
Why did you me up in there?
Move over.
Who the h... is fat ed?
I thought I was taking off
With you for a good time.
You are looking for those guy,
Aren't you?
Aren't you?
You know who they are, don't
You?
Don't you?
Some of them.
Why don't you just tell the
Police?
Because I want to find all of
Them.
Man, I have had it with lying
Men, Charlie.
The ones that say one thing and
The ones that always let you
Down.
Are you going to let me down?
Depends on what you are
Looking for.
Right now I'm going to take you.
That's Miles from here and
I'm tired.
Climb in the back seat and go
To sleep.
Why do I get stuck with crazy
Men?
Man!
That's the only kind that's
Left.
Charlie?
My brother-in-law took off
And got pissed at my sister and
Split.
I would like you to put a 10-29
Out on him.
I don't know.
If wouldn't be the first
Time.
Okay, but now you owe me one.
1973 red Cadillac
Convertible, Texas license
Number temporary 3802w.
Don't pull them over or nothing,
Just call me.
You're in a barrel if anyone
Finds out.
Don't worry.
You look better.
Does that mean I look good?
Sure does.
Anything would be an
Improvement.
I hope you're not just stringing
Me along Charlie rane.
I hope that's not what you're
Doing.
I don't have to do that, do
I?
Maybe you do.
How old do you think I am?
25.
Almost 30.
I have been around the course
A couple times now.
You sure don't look it.
Well I do in the morning
After I have been out partying
All night.
I do when I am brooding about
Some worthless man.
I have had a few of them, you
Know.
What are you getting at?
Only that you can trust me
And I want to know I can trust
You.
I want help.
Let's get out of here.
Why don't we tell them?
Forget it.
Here she goes again.
Jimmy, wasn't that the car?
I think it was.
They said no arrest, just a call
In on it.
Go ahead and get me some coffee.
Cliff, your sister better be
Good looking because he has
A real piece of a... with him.
Where is he?
Highway 90.
I'll call you for updates.
You bet.
[Laughing]
Do you know a guy named Billy
Sanchez?
Why are you looking for him.
He ain't good for nothing.
I don't want him for nothing,
I just want to talk to him.
He ain't even good for that.
Hey, Billy.
Lady here wants to talk to you.
Hello, lady.
What's your name?
I'm looking for a guy named
Fat ed.
I was told to look for him here.
I'm a friend of his from San
Antonio.
How does he get a friend like
You, ugly a... he is.
What's your name, baby?
Sherry.
I was supposed to meet him
A couple days ago, but I got
Into something else.
You mean something else got
Into you.
Ed wouldn't like that kind of
Talk.
He ain't here to hear it.
He went to the Dean house in
El Paso.
What's that?
On law paulinea road.
Did they all go over?
Except automatic slim, he is
Still here.
Why don't you wait around?
He will be back in a couple of
Minutes and drive you to El Paso
If you are really a friend of
Fat ed.
No, that's okay, I got my own
Car out front.
I'll buy you a drink.
Let he go.
It won't slow you down.
I said no thanks.
Charlie, let's go, this is
Getting ugly.
Start the car.
What kind of hustle you two
Putting down, huh?
You been looking for me,
Major?
Let me have him.
Oh, shit!
Let him go.
Let him go.
Get away.
Get away!
Get away from him!
When we get to El Paso, I am
Gone!
You know, I'm not one to leave
A man in trouble, but man, you
Don't deserve any better.
I thought I could help you, but
That was a big mistake.
Same d... mistake I always make.
The best thing I could do for
You right now is tell the
Police.
That's right.
I'm going to tell the police
And if you won't do it, I will.
And you're not going to change
My mind.
What is wrong with you?
You're driving too slow.
Where are you going?
I'm not staying in a car
With a d... lunatic.
Then get out!
[Screaming]
Charlie, I'm all you've got.
[Radio playing]
You feeling better now?
Better than what?
Better than before?
I should be asking you that
Question.
You don't have to worry about
Me.
I remember that song from
When I was alive.
Alive?
That's what we used to call
The time before we were
Captured.
[Gunfiring]
It's a h... of a wake up
Call.
What are you doing?
Practicing.
Must be planning on some
Point blank shooting, sawing off
The barrels don't give you much
Distance.
I haven't used one in years, but
I guess you never forget.
I grew up around them.
Where was that?
Just around.
My father was a master sergeant
In the army.
Still is.
Teach you how to shoot?
Ride, too.
See, he wanted a boy and got
Three girls.
Or I should say two girls and
A tomboy.
I'm kind of black sheep.
Why are you the black sheep?
I eloped when I was 17.
My momma was a church-going lady
And didn't like me very much
Because I was my father's
Favorite.
So she just acted like I was
Killing her.
Guess they were right, though.
Only stayed married for
A year.
I wish we had something more
Exciting to shoot at.
[Speaking in spanish]
Hi.
[Speaking in spanish]
God, look at me.
I'm all a mess.
I'm going to need a vacation
When this vacation's over.
I feel like I've been gone for
Two years instead of two-days.
Sure would like to soak in a hot
Tub.
Where are you going, out on
Parade or something?
You don't have to get all
Spruced up for me.
I like naturalness in a man.
Doesn't your friend live here,
The one I met in the hospital?
No.
Johnny vohden?
No.
He said he lived near El
Paso.
Well, he doesn't.
Will you sit down and relax?
You know, you don't have to do
Any of this.
You don't have to go after
These guys.
We could just jump in the car
And go 1,000-Miles from here and
Nobody would know any different.
Bury the guns in the desert.
Will you just stay with me for
A while?
Hold me?
Charlie, I love you.
He knows about your car.
The boy says you're looking
For a yankee that drives a big,
Red Cadillac.
That's right.
$5.
Yankee, huh?
Big steel hand?
Yes.
He was here.
Where did he go?
That will be 5 more dollars,
10 all together.
A big fight and now he's gone.
Where?
Why do you want to find him.
I'm paying, I ask the
Questions.
If you want some answers, you
Have to pay a little more.
Where did you get this, huh?
[Guns firing]
Hey.
[Guns firing]
Charlie, you are the quietest
Man I have ever known.
That's because I can't think
Of anything to say.
It's like my eyes are open and
Looking at you, but I'm dead.
It pulled out whatever it was
Inside of me.
Never hurt at all after that and
It never will.
Charlie?
What?
We're going back to San
Antone?
If you want to.
How about you?
I don't care if I ever see
That town again.
Good, then let's go as far
Away as we can get.
Let's go some place cold.
Let's go to Alaska.
Alaska's cold.
People don't do anything but
Just stay inside and sit in
Front of the fireplace.
And make love all day long.
Please tell me we're going.
[Music]
Charlie?
Charlie?
Operator.
Yeah, let me have the number
For the police department.
Emergency?
Yes.
72221.
Thank you.
El Paso police station.
That there is the last
American factory made
Convertible.
No more convertibles?
No more.
They cost a fortune.
The Japanese will start
Making them.
That's what happens.
We will buying our Cadillac
Convertibles from Japan.
Japan?
I ain't buying nothing from
Japs.
All he recognizes is white.
Even white people don't make
Anything good any more.
I bought a usa made TV because I
Wanted to buy American and it
Broke down in three weeks and
All the parts were made in Japan
Any way.
Next time I'm buying one
Straight from Japan.
Don's got a car like a major.
You remember don, don't you,
John?
Of course you do.
He went to high school
Around the way you did.
He played for the cowboys for
Two years.
H... he knows who don is.
Everybody knows who don is.
Let's take a look at that
Roast.
I'll help you.
Excuse me.
John, can I talk to you for
A minute?
Oh, yeah.
Excuse me.
Make yourself at home.
Say, pop, can I have one of
Them cigars.
How is that?
Can I have one of
Them cigars?
You bet you, boy.
I'm sorry about all this,
Major.
That's all right, John.
I found them.
Who?
The men who killed my son.
I'll just get my gear.
They're in a whorehouse over
In juarez right now.
There are the four that came
Into my home and there are 8 or
10 others.
Let's go clean them up.
Come on, everything's ready.
Me and the major are going
Out to get some beer.
We'll be back after a while.
What about your dinner?
Why are you wearing that thing?
He never wears his uniform when
I ask him to.
Bye, daddy.
Bye, son.
Well, where are you going?
Y'all get back here soon.
[Music]
They are all inside there
Now.
A texan with beige boots and
A tall, skinny guy with a straw
Hat that I want and a couple of
Mexicans.
They will recognize me, so why
Don't you go through the front
And pick up a hooker and take
Her upstairs.
When you hear me tap, get set.
When you hear me shooting, come
On in.
[Bar music playing]
Hey, soldier, you want to get
Married?
Not to you.
Any nice American girls here?
Take a look around, gringo,
Maybe you'll find your sister.
[Speaking in spanish]
See anything you like?
Oh, yeah.
30 minutes, 30-dollars.
I want to rent you, not buy you.
If you are looking for
A cheap thrill, go to the dog
Races.
Lead on.
Follow.
Soldier.
Let's go.
Take your time, sweetheart.
Take my time, will take more
Of my money.
You will get it if you are
Worth it.
That's what I like to hear.
[Speaking in spanish]
You want to f... or what?
I'm having a problem.
You're going to have to go.
Shit.
Relax.
[Tapping]

People.
[Screaming]
