What can be ultimate price for a heart
and for a few minutes..
..when it can give life to a person?
A very big happiness,
A very big happiness, or a big trouble and even
if it is not that, then a combination of both.
lt is that way l too thought.
But then life and its twists are
much bigger than my thoughts.
Under no circumstances
it can be delayed.
Or else just a simple look,
and there is an attraction and when it ends..
it makes one lie and it takes many forms
and for all these at least sometimes..
..twelve hours are enough.
Just twelve hours.
ln the morning you should have at least told
have called her and wished her the best..
..or at least after it was over you could
have at least asked how it went.
Yesterday and the day before it is going on
day and night isn't it? ln that it got left out.
And then it is no use to make it a calamity.
lt is just a stage item, isn't it?
Like that it is notjust
a stage item..
..she is reaching the stage level
for the first time.
Didn't l tell you, how much she
is straining for that?
How much she must have felt about it?
When l was in these hundreds of things
You could have at least reminded me.
You just tell her that l had called.
When she had gone to school
or when she was sleeping..
..tell her that l had called and
asked for details.
Sir.
- Ready, isn't it?
Ready, sir.
lf you d+E1 156on't get me, you just call
this Mathew, okay? Bye.
Did mother note one thing?
How was the competition,
whether she got the prize..
What are your hobbies?
Mainly internet surfing.
Facebook, Twitter..
..then surely some eastern music
and some reading.
Movies?
- Yeah, that too.
Name a Malayalam movie that
you like a lot?
Classmate?
- Why?
l have just completed my studies
and come out.
That is why the mood of college and
friends haven't changed till now.
l guess that is the main reason.
- Why Journalism?
lf the news that l report will make
a small change in someone's life,
then l will be happy.
lt is for that.
''Sometimes there is
a thought in my mind.''
Thank you.
When l give one song to you, you had
promised to give one to me in return.
Now since the last two days
only l am giving.
Not perfect. lf not free, then become free.
Then on Wednesday, 10.30 to 1 on my name.
Don't forget that. Okay?
l will reach home and call you.
Love you too. Bye. Bye.
Gayatri. Gayatri Verma.
- Then the other one? Shilpa?
Which Shilpa?
lt is a case of expiry date over, isn't it?
Now only, Gayatri.
Hey, Suresh, you don't listen to all his
nonsense and create some trouble.
Now who is this person?
The hottest woman, in Cochin.
Saw her, got to know her.
Moved with her for two weeks
and sang a song too.
Last week, l sang again.
This Wednesday l am going to sing again.
lntimately.
- My mother.
This is the first time he took bribe.
Due to his misfortune he got
caught in that only.
Yes. Traffic constable.
Name.. what is your name?
- Sudevan.
Sudevan. Yes. Sir.
He is a Nair. Sir should favorably tell the
minister and must take back his suspension.
He is man with 3-4 daughters.
lt is his job, isn't it?
He will have to then jump with
his family in front of a train.
Hello, can you hear now?
Yes. l was in the lift. That is why.
Yes, l will come.
Had come to shooting..
- ln the white Ford.
What happened to Rajan's cheque?
- Got cleared.
When told as it has to be
said it got cleared.
Sir, please.
What are the things, Joy?
We have kept our release on the 16th.
The people who have seen it say
the climax is too good.
Then the rest is not good?
Not like that.
- Not that way.
Tomorrow we have kept its preview.
lf sir comes..
Hey, l won't. Tomorrow l have
full day shooting.
On the 16th will you be here or..
l can't say anything.
Sometime l may have Malaysia trip.
Stand aside.
lf you too were there for the promotion,
then it would have been much better.
lf you promote it, it is enough.
l don't come for such things.
Then alright.
You first film, isn't it? Kneel and pray.
- Thank you, sir. Okay?
What happened?
- Joining on the 16th. Journalist training.
l knew it, man. l knew it.
Ok, then, l will remove
the bike and come.
ln the court..
Over. Divorce allowed. Substitute.
Not because l knew Rehan,
they suspect him too.
And then it was a relationship that had
to end from the beginning itself.
l am happy for you.
Shall l leave? Take care.
Central
Yes, let it go, go there and park.
Now one more hour it will take.
l will reach there by 1 .30-2-2.30.
lsn't it enough?
You are a doctor, aren't you?
- Yes, sir.
lf people like you start like this,
then it is difficult.
No, sir, since it was a test drive..
So what if it is a test drive?
Shouldn't wear a seat belt?
Sorry, sir.
Okay. Bring it here.
At what time we thought
of coming on this route?
At what time l thought
of buying this car.
Didn't get the color l wanted, now this..
Sir, this is lucky colour.
- Yes, l can see the luck.
Hey, l am telling you one thing.
The coming 16th is the wedding anniversary.
lt is a surprise gift to my wife.
That day in the morning when l come
for delivery if you say this and that,
l won't listen to anything.
Heard it?
''When you are smiling so much..''
- Hey, come on, man.
Okay, l will get back to you later.
Okay, bye, bye. Okay
Then go on the 16th after
prayers and join the duty.
l have told everything and made it ok.
- Thank you, sir.
But saying 3-4 daughters.
l have only one daughter.
Hey, man, when l tell the difficulties you
must enhance and enlarge it a little.
The minister isn't going to come
to your house and ask.
Then you go.
Henceforth don't do such things.
Let us go.
That is law. Who should stand,
who should go to decide that only two colors.
At least for a minute we all cross over at
a four road junction, with many expectations.
Then in just a wink to many ways.
To many goals.
Maybe we will again meet
at this same junction again.
May be some calculations that we think will
come true may follow. That is the law.
Central
The way two hearts join.
On the wings of coolness..
..on the branches of the laughter.
The dreams come looking for shores.
And the wishes and wants that flow
The lust flows endlessly
to a long life and many births
From all these the feelings
that come up and
The way two hearts join.
On the wings of coolness....
on the branches of the laughter
Central
The wishes get fulfilled.
The eyes dance.
And when you dance like a bird.
The sweetness found on the cheeks
And lips that we taste together
Takes us into clouds of happiness.
Central
We find a new language to speak
And also to write to convey
...the feeling of love and our dreams
And sing them all in happiness.
The way two hearts join.
On the wings of coolness..
..on the branches of the laughter.
The sweetness found on
the cheeks
And lips that we taste together
Takes us into clouds of happiness.
From one signal 4-5 boys
started following me.
First l didn't mind them.
Then after some time they made a lot of
vulgar comments then l speeded up a little.
They too were adamant.
They too started speeding
and rode parallel to the car.
To escape them l speeded up jumping
a signal. And l hit some vehicle.
Please.
Why didn't you stop..
ln the shock of hitting the car
l didn't stop.
l did it without knowing.
But l went straight.
l was very scared.
Then in the mood in between l..
..know what l and you.
Get some onion also from downstairs.
are doing and will say
Dad, mum wants 1/2 kg onion also.
Quarter kg onion.
Daughter said, half kg.
Sir, didn't hear properly.
Heard or not, you give quarter kg.
How much? 36-38, Rs.50.
What else you want?
- Tomatoes.
Where did l stop?
You spoke to Joychhan about my work.
Then..
After hearing your history,
he looked surprised.
Time is bad.
A man who is at home
after suspension..
..does it need an astrologer
to say that his time is bad?
lf so, then l also can do
this job, can't l?
The man is notjust some
ordinary astrologer.
He works in the Central Government.
l heard that you brought some medicines
saying your health is not good.
Sudevan, is going to join today, isn't he?
l came to know that you got hold
of the minister via Rajendran.
l thought that you must have taken
at least Rs. 50,000 bribe.
Only when, Rajendran told me you went
through so much just for Rs. 15,000?
Next time, let it come.
l will take 100,000.
But from the association's side
you must give me a welcome.
Now that fellow who just spoke to me take
his horoscope and give it to that astrologer..
if he calculates and says that someone
will beat him and kill him,
then l will believe him.
- Okay.
Wait. Wait. l am going to the office today.
l will take you to the school.
No, dad. l will walk. Saumya and
Meera are there, aren't they?
Central
These Saumya and
Meera were before also.
Then before them she was very
proud to go on dad's bike with dad.
Since last 2-3 weeks she goes to
school in their company, isn't it?
She must have got used to it.
And then dad's snap and name came in the
papers not for getting gold medal, isn't it?
Even at the age of sixteen
that labour can be seen.
Yes. Yes. Today is the release
of the film. Thank you.
Oh! l will call you.
Any call from Palakkad?
Sister had called.
She said that daughter slept well.
But when l talked to the doctor
he said that it did not matter.
At any time it may like before.
l think it is over.
10.45 lndian Airlines ticket
has been confirmed.
Thambi will come to the airport.
From there flight to Palakkad, at 1 1 .45.
Sasi and l will come by road.
No. Let Sasi come by car.
You come with me.- Okay.
Did Sudhi call?
Yes, called. Nothing special.
But the channel interview is at 1 1 .
That too live.
Didn't l tell you to make it a bit early?
Yes, since the announcement
was done early..
..now when on my way to airport
l will get down there.
lf they can do that at that time then let them.
Call them and inform that now. Understood?
After going there if they say
delay or some such thing..
Then tell them l will just leave.
- Okay.
Sir, we have changed the step.
Will you see that?
What are you guys doing?
Making fun of people?
You said you will leave me
at 8.30 now it is nine.
l can't take more than this.
There is just one shot. Please, sir.
- When l say l can't means l can't.
Mathew, get the car.
Mathew..
- Wait, let me see.
The one who is with us in Talking Point
is a very special guest.
As Mahadevan, lnspector Kiran,
Rama Murthy and as Dr. Mahendran,
the one who attracted all our hearts in
Malayalam films, the super Megastar Siddharth.
There is lot to talk, lot to know.
Welcome to the slow..
Oh damn! Show. Show. Show.
Why this slow becomes, show all the time?
lt is not slow but show.
The problem is because you are
becoming more conscious.
lf you think you will do mistake now
anyone will make mistakes.
lf it is a small mistake, then without
minding that you should go ahead.
But this is not a small mistake, is it?
lt is my first day.
ln the programme it is not
a mistake at all.
lt is just.. go through like that in the flow.
And then you shouldn't do any rehearsal at all.
Then you won't make mistakes.
Yes. No. l am at home.
What? That means? Oh God!
l am coming now.
- What is it?
The programme is starting. At 9.45.
lt seems he will reach the channel then.
Who?
- That, Siddharth.
You must drop me.
- Yes.
Why so suddenly?
Who knows? These people are like that.
l haven't even prepared well.
Tell dad and go, Rehan.
Dad, they have made the
programme a little early.
l am straight away going there.
- Yes, l will see that and call you.
You are performing well. l heard so.
Don't hurry.
- Shall we go?
All the best.
You said 9.45, didn't you?
Pray that the show doesn't become slow.
lt won't happen like that.
- Okay, aunt.
Okay, son. Bye.
- Bye.
lf you hadn't pushed him he would have
gone without telling me, wouldn't he?
He is a bit angry.
- That doesn't matter, it will change.
l don't think he is mistaken
in any way.
He has all the qualities of
his father, doesn't he?
And he has the qualification
also, doesn't he?
lf only you had called and put a word.
He would have got the job. But it will always
be a job that his father got for him.
Though he took some trouble,
he got this by himself, didn't he?
That is good.
That he will understand.
l won't understand your philosophy.
Get me tea.
Thambi, if you're free then you see lndia Mission
at 9.45. there is a programme by, Rehan.
Today is his first day. Okay?
George, it is me. Got up just now?
Our Rehan's programme is at 9.45
in lndia Vision Talking Point.
Just see and give me the feedback.
Okay?
Can we go by Panampalli route?
Yes, you want to go see girlfriend.
At this time of hurry you have time for that.
lt is first day, isn't it? Just want to
see her for a minute - Okay.
Hi, Sonia
- Hi, Sweta. How are you?
Fine. - Okay.
- How was the treatment?
lt was really nice.
Hello.
You have reached home?
l am at the Spa.
You are at the hospital, aren't you?
Do one thing, you wait
at the bread world.
l will come there just now.
- What is it? What is the matter?
Come, l will tell you.
- Okay, okay.
Everything is in the car. You should
send the feedback to us. Yes.
l was very much afraid.
Then, okay.- Message me
where the duty is. - Okay.
Okay shall l go?
- Start the car.
Central
What happened?
l will see and come.
Joining today?
- Yes.
What were you afraid of?
Some vehicle. l hit it.
ln that shock l did not wait.
l later stopped without knowing.
l was very scared.
Welcome to Talking Point.
Today we have the biggest star
of the Malayalam industry.
When you hear that you must
have understood who that is.
Yes, the one and only, Sidharth.
Are you sure that this is Shobana?
- Yes. - Thank you.
Your most prestigious project,
how do you propose to do it?
What is special about the film that
your fans are anxiously waiting for?
That he won't survive is sure.
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, sir.
Clear off.
Look, let us all be hopeful.
lf it is haematoma then if we evacuate,
then it is enough..
Then the recovery will be smooth.
Doctor, is he conscious?
No. But don't worry,
that shouldn't be a problem.
Excuse me, sir.
Left front ventricle with
intra ventricle extension..
..and midline shift and GCS with..
..before them you say all this?
That is why l used medical terms.
- Damn it. He is a doctor.
What did he say?
That car, that car broke
the signal and came, sir.
What is the name of the patient?
- Reehan Saifuddin.
The accident case that came in
the morning, isn't it? - Yes.
He is in the operation theatre.
Third floor.
l will go and come.
You all sit here.
We sit here..
Let me see what the situation is.
From now you stay here.
That is right. We will wait.
Doctor. Dr. Ram.
Yes, doctor.
Surgery is just over.
We have put him on ventilator.
Yes.
No. l will go home and come back..
Okay. l will come.
There was call from Ahalya Hospital
from Palakkad.
There a thirteen year-old-girl wants
a heart. lmmediately.
A child who had a problem
in her heart from birth.
Dilated cardio myopathy.
Since it was urgent they had
called as a part of the enquiry.
That boy his father is
your friend, isn't he?
Can't say he is my friend. Know him
as l have seen him at the club.
Come on, doctor,
what are you getting at?
lsn't he a doctor?
- Yes, surgeon.
Then he will know his boy
won't survive, right?
lf you talk to him..
- What?
lf he agrees for the heart transplant then
we can start the surgery for that immediately.
But the boy is still on ventilator.
- How many hours at the maximum, doctor?
Just fooling the people saying miracle etc
we can't fool our own selves, right?
lf we have to do it,
we have to do it immediately.
That girl's BP is going lower and lower.
Also having breathing difficulty.
Now the time is eleven.
We have reached the heart there
and do the transplant.
After that that girl won't survive.
The one who will be saved
is 13 year old girl.
lnstead of doing that waiting for a person to
die whom we know will surely die is not right.
lt is a crime. lt is very negative.
Thank you.
l don't understand why we are
hiding like this?
Don't you feel like seeing?
One day or the other,
it is a matter that everyone will know.
lf anyone asks l will tell them.
Don't need to see. You don't have any
need to hide any detail of anything.
That is enough. My son will die.
lsn't that what you are try
to make me understand?
l understand that.
But for the sake of someone else
sending him off earlier than..
Central
Hello. Hello. Where?
Okay. l am starting now.
Ask Hari to come with the camera.
The first time l see,
Priya is only a month before.
When working in Asianet,
as a programme producer.
The day on which l went to do an
interview on Siddharth Shankar.
One second.
Sasi, here.
Okay? ls the light etc, okay?
- Okay.
Steady.
Here.
Onam is a very special day for me.
l always try to come home and have meals
with my family on the Thiruvonam day.
Many times l am not able to do so.
But when l am at home, my daughter and
l together arrange the flower decoration.
Though l don't know much cooking l also
help in doing the cooking of the feast.
The Rasam that l make is like Sambhar,
my daughter says.
Normally they say famous people don't
pay attention to the affairs of home.
ls that also the case with you, sir?
No. l share everything with them.
And they tell me about everything also.
At home l am not a star.
l am a husband and a father.
Camera cut.
- Sasi.
Will you ask?
Okay. Camera roll.
Shall l ask just for a joke?
Since you say you know
everything l am asking.
Can you say who is the best friend
of your daughter if l ask?
l can. lt is me.
Who is your daughter's
favourite teacher?
Camera cut.
Priya, who is your favorite teacher?
Elizabeth, ma'am.
Camera roll.
- Rolling, sir.
That is, Elizabeth madam.
When she comes from school
she always talks about her.
She is a brilliant teacher.
Not only in teaching, but also in
overall development of her students.
ln the note of question,
there is a sensational news item.
But then, somehow l could not bring
myself to make that girl a scope material.
Today she is before me again.
As a Breaking News which
a journalist cannot avoid.
As a dying patient lying in a Hospital
and facing death she is before me.
Central
That boy has not died,
but his condition is very bad.
Death can occur at any time.
When the heart is to be taken out
he has to be alive.
Once death occurs we cannot do anything.
Not only that, let me be frank.
Priya's condition is not at all good.
BP and heart rhythm is abnormal..
..we can at most wait for another,
3 1/2 - 4 hours.
By then the new heart should
start working in Priya.
The problem is that boy's
parents haven't agreed.
Did you tell him that it is my daughter?
Mathew, call the CM's office urgently.
Sir.- He is trying.
But since he is in Delhi..
No, if sir goes and personally talks
to the boy's parents..
Just a minute. l will call now.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.
Sir, his flights were in the
morning 7.30 and 10.15.
And next flight is at night 9.20 ofjet air.
Only that is there.
See the availability of the helicopters.
Please, fast. - Okay.
Only after we got green signal
l went forward.
Then l don't know what happened.
Sister.
The doctor has specially told that
we can only allow the parents.
Sister, just two minutes. Don't want that
much also. l just want to see.
But we can allow only
one person inside.
You go.
Aditi, one person can go in. Go.
Go.
Mariana, just come here.
What?
Rate falling. l will check BP.
Call the doctor.
Start the lV.
- Yes sir.
lt is a seizure.
We are trying our best.
But..
- Doctor, please. You know how it is.
Hello, sir. l am James Joseph.
- M.P.
l am sorry, l don't know what to say.
What l am going to say, l don't know whether
it can be said in the situation you are in.
l had a call from Ahalya Hospital, Palakkad.
Mr. Siddharth Shankar.
Excuse me, sir. District collector.
He wants to talk to you.
Hello.
Look, Collector, for you and all others
my son is someone who is going to die.
But for me even now he is
my son who is still alive.
Please try to understand.
And leave me alone.
Yes, sir. l understand.
Thank you for everything.
l want to talk to my mother.
The one who is with us in Talking Point
is a very special guest.
As Mahadevan, lnspector Kiran,
Rama Murthy and as Dr. Mahendran,
the one who won all our hearts in Malayalam
films, the super Megastar Siddharth.
There is a lot to talk, lot to know.
Welcome to the slow..
Oh darn! Show. Show. Show.
Why this slow becomes, show all the time?
lt is not slow, but show.
lt was his big dream.
He wanted to be a good journalist.
A greatjournalist who will be
remembered for a long time.
And then a car who carelessly cut the signal
and came and hit us you can say.
But if l had taken a little
more care maybe..
An accident caused the
destruction of his dream, right?
We have to instead give him
something more than that.
A great human being who will be
remembered for a long time.
Rajeev should tell him
and make him agree.
We have to get his heart transplanted.
Good news. Reehan's parents have agreed.
How are the travel arrangements?
Flight or chopper?
There is no flight from Cochin.
lf you want to charter they say
they want minimum four hours.
Since there is a weather problem
helicopter is not available.
We cannot wait that much.
What is the next option?
There is only one option. By road.
Sir, Mathews is waiting.
He is asking when we are starting.
From Kochin to Palakkad
in two hours. Rubbish!
There should be some sense
in what they say.
lf you had told l would have come there.
- Tell me, Nasser, what next?
lt is impossible, sir.
No way. lt should be made
possible by hook or crook.
lt is 180km, which means
we have to move at 100kmph.
Highway is okay.
But in major districts there
are many small towns.
ln such places we can't go
beyond 60kmph.
Moreover it is a working day.
lf there is a traffic block for five minutes
all planning will go awry.
All these we know. That is why we
can't take by hospital ambulances.
We need an expert driver.
And quick control also is needed.
The police machinery has
to directly be involved.
ln the neighboring Chennai,
in a very similar event..
..the police department took over
and has done it.
They have done it very successfully.
Yes, l know that. But they got
a lot of time for planning.
And then road in Chennai and
Kerala road are not the same.
Why don't you make a try, Nasser?
When we fail, why not it be after trying?
l don't mind, sir.
But wherever we travel it will
be office hours.
Roads will be crowded and there
will be children going after school.
lf you give us orders, we will move.
But it will be sir's responsibility.
l can't take the responsibility
of such a risky mission.
lt is for a life, l agree.
But the same importance is for
the people in that van..
..and the people on the roads.
Just drop it, sir..
..it is too dangerous a game.
Once we cross Palakkad then no problem.
The rest we will take care.
We can block all the main roads
leading to the hospital.
Till then it has to be brought.
The commissioner there
is very adamant.
But we don't have time to lose.
Sir, some pressure from
the ministry level?
We are trying everything.
But the collector is not taking a stand.
That is the problem now.
That commissioner has scared
that man so much.
What is this commissioner's name?
- Ajmal Nasser.
Call and offer something.
- l did that also.
Let him quote the amount. Tell him we
will reach it to him in just ten minutes.
l have tried all that.
There is no use.
You call up your Cochin guys right now.
Right now. And tell them that
l will go to the media.
Now whoever is Ajmal Nasser is,
l don't care.
l will see to it that he will..
Sir, please.
- Dear, please. Please.
He doesn't know me.
Siddu, this is not the time to get angry.
You just try all ways.
lf you want we could have
taken up the whole process.
But we don't have the time
for that, do we?
The doctors there too once
they get a yes, immediately..
Yes.
- l am calling from Simon's office.
He wants to speak to you.
Ok. Dr. Simon D'souza.
Good afternoon, sir, this is Thomas.
What happened?
Are you all ready?
A small problem, sir.
The commissioner from there says
it is not possible to get it by road.
The heart will reach you.
And it will reach you by road.
You start your preparations.
lt is me who is saying Thomas. Trust me.
Yes, doctor, what can l do for you?
Write a resignation letter, keep it on
the table and do something else and live.
That is what you can do for me.
ls this a joke?
- Yes, it is a big joke.
Donor is ready, recipient is waiting.
Just if a green signal is received..
the doctors are ready to start the surgery.
But the people responsible are hiding with
frozen hands. What is funnier than this?
75 vehicles moving every minute, 3 mega
cities lnnumerable lanes, one way routes..
..less than 50 traffic signals about
40 police personnel..
..from 3.30 more than 100 school's
students walking pedestrians.
Doctor, before over reacting like this
you must think about such details..
Without knowing to which medicine
the patient will react, a quick surgery,
a possible venal thrombosis
damage to kidneys, lever or any other organ..
..from anti-rejection medication
heart attack that can happen at any time..
..heart rhythm problem,
or else failure.
lf you want to fight to say about technical
risk fight should be taken on equal level.
Obstacles will be there, commissioner..
..the police force is there to overcome
that and move forward.
We don't need you if it was a just road
which can be crossed like a fantasy.
This hospital has many good
and expert ambulance drivers.
Look, doctor, l don't have the responsibility
to answer you or convince you.
Don't try also.
When you go for escort for a minister
for a swearing in ceremony..
..there is no risk, obstacles,
and all the calculations..
..which you said before
are not there at all.
don't want to hear your answer that
you may give now which is ready with you.
Look, there is some limit.
l too don't have time to argue.
Before you make a decision
remember something.
lf you say no nothing will happen here.
Like all the days this day also
will pass by and will be forgotten.
But one yes from you may
sometimes become history.
A history that will give courage to say
yes to many who will come after you.
Central
Emergency meeting, twenty minutes.
Minister's pilot and police escorts,
every one of them.
We are starting the mission,
on my responsibility.
180 km, 2 hours.
Starting point Lakeshore hospital Ernakulam,
destination, Palakkad Ahalya Hospital.
There will be no halt.
You won't get even one second to relax.
lt is going to be a very dangerous
journey through out.
lt is 10, 20 or 30 times more dangerous
than going as a pilot for a minister.
We have given information to
all the district's police force.
ln every point traffic control
arrangement will be done.
lf any one of you..
lf any one of you is ready we will be
starting this mission within half an hour.
Sir, just two hours up isn't it a very risky
job, is it? ln such a short notice,
how much traffic control is possible, sir?
When seeing what sir says only blocking
other vehicles will not be a solution.
Since it is a busy time
if you block like that,
then there are possibilities
of having more serious problems also.
When so many commotions are there not only
our vehicle is there on an emergency.
Not only that people who are not
used to traffic regulations..
and no time to make them understand.
Leave that, Balu all that
responsibility is mine.
Whoever takes up this mission he
will have to believe in me completely.
At every stage of the journey,
but there is no time for argument.
lf you say no nothing will happen here.
Like all the days this day also will pass by.
And will be forgotten.
But one yes from you may
sometimes become history.
A history that will give courage to say
yes to many who will come after you.
Yes, l need one of you to say yes.
lf Ramakrishnan was there,
then l wouldn't have troubled you
Even after getting an admission
to such a good course,
if you say you can'tjoin it
she will be very much upset, dear.
l will leave you at the school.
No, dad, l will walk. Saumya and
Meera are there, aren't they?
Get ready for the surgery and be
at the Operation Theatre in 10 minutes.
Tell all the nurses to be at hand.
- Ok, doctor.
Some are on leave l know,
but please get them.
Central
Slowly. For a drive.
Come, let us go for a drive, come.
Sudevan, the van is ready.
From here first you will go Lakeshore hospital.
The surgery will start in 10 minutes.
After that all the arrangement
the hospital staff will do.
So by the time you get there
everything will be ready.
lf you can start from here at two
then you must reach Palakkad by four.
You will get my messages.
Sudevan, this is the route map.
Straight roads and highways,
go at maximum speed.
ln cities and towns and junctions
you shouldn't go less than 70 kmph.
The first 25 km is very crucial
in straight road.
To control all the other vehicles
a force has gone ahead.
That 25 km you must cover
in 12 minutes.
After that two crowded junctions.
When you slowdown over there you
have to balance what you gained before,
which means the first 25kms you will have
to go at a speed of 125 kmph.
ln this journey there will
be two people with you.
One is cardiac surgeon
Dr. Vinoy Joseph.
Sorry, doctor, l can't go.
l had said okay thinking it will be a helicopter.
But this is too much risk.
Please leave me out of it.
And then, Rajeev. Reehan's friend.
Surgery is over, Reehan's death occurred.
There is a small change. lnstead of
Dr.Vinoy Joseph, Dr. Abel Therian will come.
We wish the mission a success.
Hello!
- My phone will be switched off for a while.
l have an emergency duty.
ln Cochin?
No, l will have to go up to, Palakkad.
Escort?
- No
What?
A duty which l don't know whether
l will be able to complete.
My name as a bribe taking
constable at some place.
lt is a duty which l went
forward and took.
Shall l go? l will come back by evening.
Rajeev. Abel. Sudevan.
Noted traffic constable Sudevan
has taken up the job.
He who usually drives the pilot vehicle for the
ministers came forward and took up the duty.
Good going, Sudevan you are
doing absolutely fine.
What is the speed?
- lt is about 120 kms.
Fine.
Okay, 22 kms covered, sir.
Good, that means two minutes
before the time we expected.
Keep going you are doing great.
lt is that van, isn't it?
Passing, sir.
Yes. Mathews.
Ok. Thank you. Keep me posted, sir.
So far so good. 25 kms have passed.
This is the dress that the patient
was wearing.
The van crossed, it will reach
within two minutes.
Okay. We are all set here.
ln just two minutes the van
will pass from here.
Though it is a little trouble
all of a sudden for the people..
Basha.
- They haven't reached there.
The road is clear.
- Okay good.
Sudevan, the road is clear.
Keep the same speed.
Sudevan...
What is this,
connection got cut?
lt is not possible, sir.
- Please check it.
Get the RTO there.
We are waiting sir.
He hasn't come there?
- No, sir.
Hey, what is happening?
- No response, sir.
The number you are calling is switched off.
Please call after some time.
How much time we have to wait?
Let us go. Come on, this is working time.
We are waiting for long.
You must leave us
You must leave us
Stand aside. Stand aside.
No trace of them. lt is quite a while
that they should have passed by.
l doubt if there was any accident.
Shall we take the jeep and go, sir?
Okay, if you see him moving,
then don't ask him to stop. Okay?
No. - There is no need for him to
deviate in this straight road.
No luck, sir.
The van is missing.
What?
- The van is missing.
The van is missing somewhere
on the way.
This was just disclosed by the police
and they are shocked.
They are thinking how to
tackle this unexpected issue.
Didn't go today?
- Taken half day leave.
Sister?
- Sister has just left.
Where to this trip is?
Mumbai, a studio conference.
- Okay.
My friend, Reehan. Okay. Tony, Maria.
- Fifth floor office. - Hello.
Studying?
- No, in lndia Vision. - Oh!
Actually today is his first day.
- Oh, all the best.
Thank you.
Okay.
- See you. - Bye.
Thanks.
- Already late.
l have seen this boy somewhere before.
Did sister tell you?
That day when l saw l did not feel so.
But today l have a small doubt.
- ls it? - Yes.
Then all the best.
- Okay.
Seeing him he looks alright
Bye.
- Bye.
Okay? Okay, l will meet you
in the afternoon. Yeah.
Catch you.
Maybe the conference may
be postponed by a day.
That is always the case, isn't it?
- They had called from south branch.
They say that we only should
do the presentation.
Will it be done?
- What is this?
The opposition says the minister
is directly helping the goons.
The minister says that isn't true.
The goons are doing theirjobs
without any worry.
l don't believe this.
What is this, didn't l tell you that..
we shouldn't give political statements
at least thousand times?
No, Maria, since this goons' issue
has become serious problem,
at least we should give
healthy criticism..
l don't want such a healthy criticism.
That the journalists will do.
We are only for entertainment.
Just entertainment.
We don't want any smart talks.
Go and tell them now.
ln the last meeting l had clearly told them.
ln that he didn't say of any problems.
No. But you will see l will get
a phone from above.
Take it back. Quickly. What is it?
- One car hit a bike and went away.
Go back or you will get stuck.
When l saw the way those boys like that
l had thought something is going to happen.
Hey, we may miss flight.
- We will go by that other route.
At present the correct time
is 2 hr 25 min and 56 seconds.

Pick. Pick. Pick. Pick.
Madam, the report of a person.
Shaji has asked you to go through
and give your feedback.
Nice shirt, ma'am.
- Thanks.
Cool.
Alex. Alex. Can you hear me?
Yes, sir.
- Okay
Our men should go to all lanes
and side roads..
Don't leave any vehicle which you
suspect without checking.
No luck, sir.
Wireless in the van has problem.
But while starting the vehicle all
communications were in good condition.
Either a severe shake like an accident or
purposely they must have cut the connection.
Or else there is no chance
for any sort of problem.
Sir, now the problem is our mission
is very much behind.
lt is already 2 hr 40 min.
As every minute is passing by it is
getting more and more impossible.
We will have to just forget it.
And now if he sees the van to
continue the mission means..
He is right, sir.
Even if we find the van, it is sure that
our mission will fail that is sure.
Failure, means defeated.
Retreat l am going to do that.
Sir, got message from the
mobile companies.
All the three numbers of the van
are switched off now.
So they are not able to trace the location.
But in-between one of those
numbers became on.
lt sent two messages to other mobiles.
We have got the number that
received the messages.
The first one was in Kadavandara tower
and then it reached the Vayakkad tower..
And now it has just entered
Edappalli tower..
That means that number is
also travelling.
Get me both the numbers
and details.
The number that was switched on in-between
and the number that received the message.
Sir, got here.
Where?
- Here.
Sir.
- ls Sriram at station?
No, sir. l am outside.
At Edappalli, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.
Okay, good, note one number.
- Sir.
Hello, if you are travelling,
please stop the vehicle.
Hello, hello, can you hear me?
Where are you now?
ln which traffic signal?
ln which direction is your vehicle?
l am here only. And don't try to move.
What make of car?
You must get down from the car.
l am behind you, sir.
Your mobile please.
Who sent you this message?
My brother.
Please, Gayatri, we must meet a little early.
When you say all we get
is just one or two hours.
There is not enough time for even starters.
You have to give me at least five course.
Or else, one thing.
Just a second.
l will go, see and come.
Take him to the hospital.
Move aside. Leave way.
Hello.
- What happened?
l am Jitu's friend.
He has just gone outside.
Shall l ask him to call you back?
Hello.
l will call you back, Okay.
Who at this time of the night?
- No one.
No one l said.
The hottest woman in cochin.
Saw and got to know her.
Gayatri, l am with one friend.
Didn't l tell you, Dr. Abel?
Yes, at east meet tomorrow.
Now the will you give me
the usual or should l give?
Hey, it doesn't matter even if he listens.
He is our man.
Hey, Abel!
Central
Patient named Reehan's heart
is to be operated.
Yes, doctor.
- We are going in for the heart transplant.
Get ready for the surgery.
And be at the operation theatre
in ten minutes.
Dr. Shreedhar, move patient
to the theatre now.
l know that you are on leave today.
But please do come.
Abel, surgery is over five minutes before.
The condition of the girl at Palakkad
is becoming serious.
l talked to the doctor over there.
Sir, the police vehicle is on the way.
- Good.
Vinoy, get ready to go.
Sorry, doctor, l can't go.
Thinking that it will be helicopter
l said okay first.
But this is too risky.
Please leave me out of it.
Please, doctor.
At the last minute you..
l have a surgery at 1 .30,
or else l would have gone.
Now..
Abel, can't you go?
Rajeev.
Sudevan.
Abel.
Let it go.
Move from the way.
Sudevan, switch on your mobile.
One important message.
Dr. Abel's wife met with an accident.
She is in the lCU now.
Don't tell him anything now.
You must drop him at the nextjunction.
From there another doctor
will be arranged.
Okay, sir.
- Now you can switch off.
You come to the junction near your office
an important thing to be told to you.
l will be there.
Turn the vehicle.
l said turn the vehicle.
The unexpected missing of the vehicle
has put the police in a spot.
They are thinking how to tackle it.
The van which was
moving right on time...
..must have turned in one of the
roads in the middle..
so the police suspects.
But without the instruction of the
police how did such a thing occur?
lt was to reach by evening.
Now we don't know how to give any hope..
Sir, please
Mathew..
Call Cochin and ask about
the situation at present.
We should also know what action
the police has taken, isn't it?
lf there is some pressure from our side also,
they will have some interest.
Siddu, you speak to them.
All the three numbers in the van
are switched off now.
So we are not able to trace
their location.
But one of the numbers was
put on in the middle.
The other two mobile..
Mathews, two messages have
gone to the mobiles in the van.
You must trace the location of the
mobile to which it goes.
When l get the details l will
give it to you, okay?
l want to know.
- Sir, we got something.
Where?
- This one.
Dr. Abel Therian.
Hey, Shaji.
Central
No.
Don't. l will throw it.
Hello, Maria.
We are on the way. Where are you?
l am here in Pudukkadu forest area.
What happened?
l think l killed Sweta.
lt is not something l deliberately did.
But it happened.
She was cheating me, Maria.
With Chiku...
My best..
How did you do it, Abel?
l hit her with a car.
l don't know, Maria.
l don't know how l did it.
l didn't ever think..
Maria, l..
Maria, l want to go somewhere.
l just want to run away from here.
Wait there.
We will reach there in fifteen minutes.
So we can confirm it, sir.
From the highway he is
deviating and coming.
James called and told now.
Vishnu, he is there only.
He is coming.
He will reach there. From forest area.
You wait there.
Sir, within 10 minutes Vishnu's
Trichur team will reach there.
Please come.
Please call after sometime.
Not able to get.
Call once more and try.
Hey, no. No.
Doctor, please listen to what l am saying.
l will be able to help you.
Hello.
Hello. l am Sidharth Shankar.
Priya is my daughter.
Please don't cut the call.
Look, doctor..
l will do whatever doctor wants
to be done.
lf you need security l will make
all the arrangements.
l have connections.
No one will disturb you from any side.
l will save you.
l can promise you that.
Hello. Hello. Look, doctor,
l can assure you that.
Doctor, please try to understand me.
Now listen carefully.
l don't know what your problems are.
And l don't want to know them either.
l want my daughter.
l want my daughter.
Nothing is bigger than that.
Neither you nor your problems.
Last 13 years l am waiting when
she will go beyond our reach.
Pray to God. Hope for the best.
l am fed up of hearing that.
Before me this day is just a prediction.
And you and your problem
is obstructing that.
Did you hear that?
ls your problem bigger than
my 13 years of worry?
Take it. Go. Go.
The woman who he called,
she won't come.
lnstead the police will come.
l know that.
He got it into the problem.
lnstead of what happened
we can give him an opportunity.
lt is we who have decided that.
Sudevan, Sudevan, tell me.
We have started again, sir.
lt is a muddy road through the forest.
At the moment it is going at 80 km
speed towards Trichur.
We will get in the first main road
that we will see.
Where is that doctor?
- He is with us.
What? Sudevan, for God's sake listen.
We have arranged another doctor.
He will join you at Trichur.
Dr. Abel, you..
l will take the responsibility of Dr. Abel.
He is enough for me in this mission.
Come on, Sudevan,
he is a criminal.
l will not allow you to continue
the mission with him.
As soon as you reach the main road,
you must give him in our custody.
Our people will be there.
Do you get me?
After the mission is over,
l myself will hand him over, sir.
You must leave this risk to me.
Sudevan, l don't know
why you are doing this.
We don't have any time now.
From now every minute is
worth 20 minutes.
lf you don't reach within the next 15 minutes
if you don't reach the Trichur, Mannati road..
then we will have to
stop the mission.
lf you come you will have to move at
the speed of 100kmph,
and we cannot take the
risk of having him with us.
lf you have trusted me in this mission
you will have to trust me in this also.
Sudevan..
- Please, sir. Trust me.
What about the wireless?
lt is disconnected, sir,
Rajeev is trying to connect it.
Now we are on the speaker phone.
- Switch it to the hand phone.
Yes, sir.
- Are you mad?
The one with you is a criminal
who has made a murder attempt.
Try to connect the wireless.
You can use the mobile only
when absolutely necessary.
And for no reason you can
put the speaker on.
Understand
- Yes, sir.
Central
Left or right?
- What is happening, Sudevan?
Sir, in front of me there are two roads.
Left and right.
Which way to take for Trichur?
Oh, where is this road?
Can you give me some identification?
No, sir.
With no cars or people around..
While seeing the geography..
Have you stopped van right now?
- Yes, sir.
See if you can find some on the way.
Or else see if you can find any sign board.
No, sir.
- lt must be left.
When you see the Geography it is left.
Sir, Rajeev says it must be left.
- No.
Don't do anything without being sure.
lt is left, sir, l am telling you.
We are wasting time.
Didn't they say that we have to reach
Trichur within 15 minutes?
We are turning left, sir.
''Trichur''
People, please co-operate with us.
The instruction is only ambulances and
emergency vehicles can pass.
All others have to deviate
to the stadium road.
All the people should co-operate with
us forjust 10 minutes.
lf they have reached Trichur town
and compensate the time.
that we have lost we cannot travel by
the route that we had planned before.
We should take this route.
But what is the problem
in this route means..
The mobile number you are calling
is out of coverage area.
lt is out of coverage area.
The time is already over.
For the last 15 minutes they are blocking the
road and waiting at Mannati and waiting.
Yes, Vishnu.- We reached the
spot which you told us, sir.
They are not here.
l feel that they are..
Vishnu, they are moving, it is okay.
Thanks.
Okay, sir.
And Vishnu, are you sure they
have not crossed you and gone?
We are sure, sir.
- What if you have missed him?
Never, sir. They have not crossed us.
l am sure.
Okay. Thanks.
They have missed the road somewhere.
Then we have to..
- No, sir.
we have come this far, isn't it?
Let us wait a little while more.
- Did they miss the road?
Or the doctor who is with them did some
new drama, we don't know.
Sir, at least till the time he
comes back in the range..
What is the use of coming
within the range?
Now itself we are way too behind.
Now we have only one hour
with us in our hand.
No luck, sir.
Rajeev's phone is switched off.
Call the commissioner sir and tell him that
we will reach the main road soon.
The last outgoing call.
No range, sir.
- Call from your phone.
Sir, it is 18 minutes since
we blocked the road.
What should we do?
Sir, should we wait longer?
Don't. The mission is cancelled.
Mission cancelled, roads to be cleared
and signals to be back to normal.
Sir..
Sudevan, the mission is cancelled.
Sir, please don't cancel the mission.
We are just reaching the main road.
- As if you are really reaching.
l had told you to confirm
the road and move.
Sir, we have reached.
We can see the main road.
At the most it is 100 meters now.
The van hasn't entered.
We have entered the main road.
Moving at 90 kms.
Pravin. are you sure?
- l am very sure.
The van hasn't entered, sir.
Pravin, are you sure?
- l am very sure.
Sir, emergency call. From Trivandrum.
Hello.
- Yes sir.
They have entered on the Vaniampara route.
lt is a road which is 8 km
from the Trichur town.
That they made a mistake
to the Trichur town is right.
But it is a perfect mistake.
They are 8 Kms in front of the road that
we thought they will come in and enter.
Which means?
- Which means the mission is on.
Hello.
- Hello.
Madam, one Mr. Vetri from Times..
To know if you can give information...
...if the ambulance connected to the
heart can pass through the city.
For the co-operation of the public.
But l said we can't.
Because it doesn't have the
entertainment value that we need.
No, after the nextjingle we have
to start the announcement.
Whichever program gets delayed,
it doesn't matter.
Got it?
- Yes, madam.
Abel, Sweta is out of danger.
She will be conscious soon.
Central
ln the next 10 minutes the vehicle
will reach the main road.
The vehicle will pass
by Trichur Paalakkad road.
Please allow the vehicle to pass.
Maybe that will save a life.
We should do what we can.
Maybe that we can be
proud of that later.
Yes, sir, they have reached.
Hello, can you hear me, sir? Hello!
Hello, can you hear me, sir?
Yes, l can.
- Great.
Now there is 85 kms.
We have 45 minutes.
Possible if roads are clear.
Maintain speed.
We are just 45 minutes away
from success.
The visitors are shouting in the
room there and are increasing.
And in the lobby the phone is engaged.
You had given an interview
today morning, hadn't you?
Some sort of it that l gave.
Till the time she reaches here
her condition will become so..
After the surgery is over,
mother had said she will come.
Tell her not to come.
l will be here.
l have told Mathews to postpone quite
a lot of engagements.
Then you have the alternative
to postpone, don't you?
But the reason should be
something like this.
Telling you of other important
things is of no use, is it?
Hello!
Yes, okay.
ln your busy time in-between you
should turn and see.
Amongst the things that you have
neglected her childhood is there.
ln between some 15 days,
orjust 10 days should keep aside for her.
But if you say all this running is for her
future, then l won't believe it.
All this was for showing off to your friends and
colleagues or to by the latest model Caravan..
which others can't buy,
for your ego boost?
She may say that she is the
daughter of Siddharth Shankar
but she will do only that.
But if she has any problem in her life she will
never come with it in front of you.
You are the biggest failure
as her father.
She has many close friends
in all places.
Debu, what is the name of the girl
that was in the hospital?
Aditi.
Where is that girl now?
Hello!
- l am Reehan's father.
Her mother and l are now at her home.
Can Aditi come here?
l will come.
Priya's heartbeat has abnormal variations.
Condition is very bad, doctor.
lf we don't start her surgery within
half an hour we will lose her.
Dr. Abel, can you hear me?
- Yes, tell me.
Priya's BP is becoming dangerously low.
Her pulse is also weak.
lf there is no surety of reaching in time,
then it is better to put her on ventilator.
Hello, if you put her on ventilator then
we won't be able to save her.
Take her to the operation theatre.
Start all the procedures for surgery.
See her vital signs and give
her anaesthesia.
Doctor, we will be there on time.
Within 30 minutes 78 kms.
As per the plan we have
40 minutes balance.
Now we have only one way in front of us.
Billal colony.
lf they have to reach within 30 minutes then
we have to pass through Billal colony.
The colony is joined with the mosque.
Minorities are very strong over there.
The police cannot suddenly get in there.
Few times we tried for catching black market
goods, there was even firing at this place.
lf they can cross the colony with the same
speed then the mission will be a success.
That is sure.
But it is a very crowded area, a lot of shops
and many customers coming from outside.
l don't know.
l really don't know.
Billal colony, l know that place.
We have gone there many times
to get dvd for foreign tourists.
lt is a very crowded place.
lf we go through that place
we will surely get stuck.
Sir, l want the number of Siddharth Shankar's
secretary Mathew's number.
What?
l will tell you, sir. A last try,
please give me his number.

Just at the start the road is broad but
as we go inside the road narrows.
Only one car can go with difficulty.
Be very, very careful.
l am there when you enter the colony.
l know the place very well.
There are a lot of lanes.
Before you reach l will make
sure that. The roads are clear.
Doctor, l need your number.
lf there is any emergency l will call.
Hello, Sanji, we are entering the colony.
For whatever reason no vehicle should
come opposite to our vehicle.
