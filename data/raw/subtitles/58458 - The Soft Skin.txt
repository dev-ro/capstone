Crossing
I just caIIed your ofice.
The subway broke down,
not a cab in sight.
- HeIIo, OdiIe.
- HeIIo, Pierre.
- When's pIane time?
- I've got 40 minutes.
In this trafic? Never!
- I must try it, Franca.
- I've packed your suitcase.
HeIIo, daddy!
HeIIo, princess.
- WiII you take the car?
- If you come aIong to park it.
OnIy if you do the driving...
I make you too nervous.
It's my husband.
- It's a tie rack.
- Stop kidding.
What's up?
Pierre's Iate.
He's Iecturing in Lisbon.
- I can drive you.
- Franca wiII do it.
Go ahead,
you're a much better driver.
That's right, he is.
Bye, princess.
Bye, daddy.
Be good now.
Can I ride to the airport?
You know you can't.
Why not? She'II enjoy it.
Okay, you can come.
MademoiseIIe, wouId you get
Sabine's coat, pIease.
CaII to teII me
where you are staying.
Here's an articIe about you.
I'II read it Iater.
PIease be carefuI.
He can aIways catch another pIane.
- What's the time?
- It's 3:45.
We'II never make it.
Is your taIk on StendhaI ?
No, on BaIzac.
There's a speed Iimit
but what the heII.
A cop!
If he's after us, we're sunk.
You just Ieave it to me.
Bye MicheI, thanks.
- Porter?
- No thanks.
The Lisbon pIane,
can I stiII make it?
I'm not sure...
Mr. Lachenay for the Lisbon fIight?
Let me check.
They might have taken
the Iadder away.
Check in Mr. Lachenay's Iuggage.
This way, pIease. Let's hurry.
They're taking the Iadder away.
No, it's going back.
Let's hurry.
Quick, the door!
PIease...
Fasten your seat beIt
and no smoking. Thank you.
Seats forward, pIease.
WiII you wait here, pIease?
We can go now.
A photo with the stewardess, pIease.
This way, Mr. Lachenay.
Here's the bathroom.
Fine.
Perfect.
For you.
BALZAC AND MONEY
Why BaIzac and Money?
WeII, I'm a fan of BaIzac's...
and I don't despise money.
But aII joking aside,
that happens to be
the titIe of one of my books.
How about a book
on BaIzac and Love?
Why not?
There's a fuII house.
We'II need some extra seats.
- What's Ionesco up to?
- He's doing fine.
- We'd better go now.
- I'm ready.
- Good Iuck.
- Thank you.
As soon as I am through
with the introduction...
I know what to do.
See you Iater.
Ladies and gentIemen...
We've got a smaII probIem
with the microphone.
I present you Pierre Lachenay.
How about Iunch tomorrow?
Sorry, I Ieave at noon.
What a pity.
Look, it's Pierre Lachenay.
We hope to see you in Paris
very soon. Goodbye.
Here's where I get of.
I'II caII you.
Yes, tomorrow.
I forgot to ask you your fIoor...
That's quite aIright.
I'm sorry.
Thank you, sir.
WouId you ring room 813?
HoId on.
HeIIo, room 813?
Miss, I was in the eIevator
with you...
I wanted to apoIogize...
ApoIogize for what?
You got of at the 8th fIoor...
Of course.
WeII, since I'd past
my fIoor anyway...
and you had so many packages...
I shouId have heIped you with them.
Not at aII.
That's perfectIy aIright.
WeII forgive me...
Look, I wonder...
CouId we have a drink together?
Right now?
Yes, right now.
Do you know what time it is?
Oh, it's past 1 a.m.
And the bar's cIosed.
Then, couId we have
a drink tomorrow?
There's reaIIy no point,
you know.
I see. I'm very sorry...
Good night. PIease excuse me.
Look, I didn't mean to be so rude.
It was very kind of you to caII me.
Let's have that drink together.
Fine. In the morning?
No, I've got to go shopping.
Can we make it in the afternoon?
Yes, of course.
In the bar at six?
AIright.
Good night.
Do you enjoy... your work,
or do you disIike it?
I Iike my job.
I started a year ago.
They said I'd soon be fed up.
Maybe.
Many girIs do quit after a few years.
What happens to them?
They get married.
I Iove my parents...
They Iive in Bordeaux.
That's where I'm from.
Papa used to say it's a job
for a mob,
but now, he doesn't mind.
- Don't you know her?
- Yes, I do.
They're friends of mine.
That's Frank. He's the co-piIot
of the pIane you came on.
We aImost met six months ago.
What do you mean?
I knew a TV writer
who worked with Louise de ViImorin.
She had us to dinner once.
You were expected.
We waited, but you never showed up.
I just couIdn't heIp it.
I haven't read aII of your books.
In fact, I haven't read any.
But I've seen you on teIevision.
So, at the airport,
I recognized you.
... so BaIzac decides
to put out a noveI a month.
Not sIim ones, mind you,
but huge voIumes.
He writes a chapter a day.
He can't Iive on what
the pubIishers pay him,
so he buys his own printing pIant.
But business is bad
and his partners puII out.
He decides to do it aII by himseIf,
casting his own type,
setting it himseIf,
even making his own paper.
But he Ioses everything,
incIuding Mme de Berny's money.
Wasn't she his mistress?
Yes. I'II teII you
how that came to pass.
Mme de BaIzac wants
a wife for her son, Honore'.
Mme de Berny has two daughters
to marry of.
Honore' meets the two young girIs,
who Ieave him coId.
But he faIIs in Iove
with the mother.
That's marveIIous!
I've been taIking for hours.
It was fascinating!
I'II Iend you some books,
if you'd Iike.
I didn't reaIize
it was getting so Iate!
Look how kind these foIks are.
In France, the boss wouId have
put us out hours ago.
I'II ask for the biII.
It must be dayIight by now.
- A cofee, pIease.
- Coming, Madame.
Matches?
- Surprised?
- A IittIe.
It was easy.
I caIIed your secretary,
then your Lisbon hoteI,
checked with the airport
and here I am!
MicheI and OdiIe
are coming over Iater.
I knew you'd be tired
but it was onIy possibIe today.
They are going to Japan.
How does one turn of this heater?
I guess we can turn that of.
- I hate sports programs.
- So do I.
The other day,
on the way back from the airport,
my car broke down
on the rue Saint Denis.
What were you doing there?
TeII us aII about it.
Not rue St Martin, rue St Denis.
I was just going
to the Japanese art shop.
To buy some prints, I suppose.
You guessed right.
I meant to ask you...
- Ice cream?
- Yes, pIease.
... where you stay in Tokyo?
The Takanawa HoteI is pretty good.
- Listen.
- What is it?
That's Sabine.
I'II go this time.
Is it your first trip to Japan?
No, I aIready went there
2 years ago.
As soon as you put a cigarette
in your mouth, a woman Iights it up.
What are you doing?
I'm Iooking for my book.
It's Iate.
You shouId be fast asIeep.
I have sIept.
Yes, but not enough.
Back to bed, now.
Here.
And here.
That's enough, now.
I'm cIosing the door.
Open it more.
Is that enough?
A bit more.
No more than this.
They're going.
You might at Ieast say goodbye.
So you're of to Tokyo?
Not yet.
They are Ieaving next month.
See you at Suzanne's tomorrow.
Let's go together.
We'II see. I'II caII you.
I can reIy on you to caII.
Have a good trip back.
Goodbye.
Were you bored?
No, I Iike them.
They're nice.
By the way, Kanayan caIIed.
He's furious.
Again?
What is it this time?
It seems
that in the Iatest edition,
his articIe was put in Iast pIace.
He said: ''I know it's petty,
""but as I"m from
an underdeveIoped country...
''I've got
a terribIe inferiority compIex.''
I feIt Iike quoting that joke...
''That's no compIex, my dear,
you're reaIIy inferior!''
But that wouId be going too far.
Once you know him,
he's reaIIy a nice guy.

pierre LACHENAY, president
5th floor, Ieft
- What about that caII?
- The Iine's busy.
Can we do the maiI now?
If you Iike.
For Mr. Kanayan,
17, street so and so.
My dear Kanayan,
You're decision
to stop writing for us
is due to a misunderstanding...
No. I'II Iunch with him instead.
- And the other Ietters?
- Later.
What about the caIIs?
I'II take these if they caII back.
So I'm not caIIing anyone?
No one eIse.
And your appointment?
Yes, I remember.
- I'm going out.
- And your appointment?
I'II be right back.
When you caIIed,
I was on my way out.
When's a good time?
It's hard to say.
My hours are so crazy.
I Iose many friends that way.
PeopIe invite me,
but they are never sure
I'II turn up,
so they stop asking me.
WeII, I'II never stop.
I'II aIways be there
whenever you need me.
God, it's windy!
Do you have to go to gym?
It's part of the refresher course.
What's that?
We practice first aid,
safety driIIs
and how to handIe Iifeboats.
It's Iate, I must run.
- Guess what I've got!
- Something for me?
It's a record.
A IittIe girI singing?
No, something nicer.
Haydn's Toy Symphony.
You hear toys and birds caIIs
in the music.
Wait and Iisten.
It's IoveIy.
Where's the paper that was here?
I didn't touch it.
It's not here and I need it!
Let's see if it's up there.
It had a book review
I meant to keep.
I'm sure it's around.
Here it is.
This isn't the one, goddamn it!
CaIm down.
Our news deaIer can get it for you.
I want it right now!
Is that so?
WeII, get your Iousy paper yourseIf!
I Iove You.
Ever since Knowing You,
I"ve become a new man,
one who cannot conceive
of Iiving without You. I Iove You.
Are you coming or going?
We take of in haIf an hour.
I'm taking the bus.
Are you coming with me?
Catherine, pIease,
I've got to see someone.
AIright, bye.
You're stiII here?
I saw a pIane take of
and assumed you were on it.
Lot's of pIanes take of
from here, you know.
They're changing a wheeI,
so we're deIayed.
Are you asIeep?
You're mean!
I'm sorry I carried on so
about that paper.
It wasn't that urgent.
Besides, I found it
ten minutes Iater.
Let's go away for a few days.
We haven't been aIone
together for years.
Sabine couId stay with OdiIe.
What do you think?
A few days in the country?
Maybe. We'II see.
HeIIo, Mr. Lachenay.
How is Madame?
She's fine.
The menu.
- Did you wait for me yesterday?
- Yes, you were Iate.
What happened?
A snowstorm in Frankfurt.
I'm sorry.
Next time we're heId up,
I couId cabIe you.
Or caII my ofice.
What about your secretary?
It doesn't matter.
I didn't expect you.
GIad?
Yes, I was feeIing bIue.
Here's a present.
You can use it to make notes
during your Iectures.
Thank you.
I'm most pIeased.
Can I sIeep at your pIace?
I'm not expected home.
Look, I hate to say no,
but I'm scared...
of the concierge.
Besides, the IandIady's
an oId friend of my parents.
No one's ever spent
the night there. We can't.
Don't be angry.
I want to stay with you, too.
I understand.
Why don't we sIeep some pIace eIse?
AIright.
First, I'II pick up a dress.
Then, a nice restaurant.
A pIace where we can dance?
Choose a pIace.
I warn you, I don't dance.
I never Iearned how.
Even when you were... I mean...
Yes, even when I was young.
That made it hard to find a wife.
Don't be siIIy!
Go ahead, dance.
What wiII you do?
I'II just Iook at you.
That wiII be my pIeasure.
LUXURY STUDIOS
Open 24 hours a daY
- A room pIease.
- No reservation?
Sorry, not now.
You can go upstairs.
But I'II have a room in 15 minutes.
Can you wait?
Fifteen minutes?
PIease, Pierre, Iet's go.
Of course.
Disappointed?
No, I feIt the same way.
I'd no idea it wouId be so sordid.
We need a pIace of our own.
I'II take you home.
- I'm of now.
- One more kiss.
Listen.
We'II be carefuI, come on up.
Come.
I'II go first.
It's too risky.
You'd be worried.
There's another way.
When do you Ieave?
In two days. I'II be back Monday.
Next week, I've got a Iecture
in Reims. You'II come aIong.
We'II have two whoIe days
on our own.
That'II be wonderfuI.
Paris is no good for us.
Yes, you're right.
Think of me.
Where are you going now?
Home.
I'II teII my wife I just got back.
I don't want you to go there.
What's the matter?
Just Iooking at...
your bIue jeans.
You disapprove?
WeII, I prefer you in dresses.
Did you bring any?
Of course.
Great.
We need gas.
Here?
FiII it up, pIease.
50 francs.
Look at your picture!
Are you giving a Iecture in Reims?
No, I'm to present a fiIm AIIegret
made before Andre' Gide's death.
I accepted onIy so that we can have
two days together.
Look up the hoteIs in Reims.
The Grand HoteI's the best.
The sponsors wiII be at that one.
What's next?
Next, The Lion d'Or.
That might be risky too.
The MicheIet just has rooms.
We can eat out. Where is it?
It's pIace MicheIet in Reims.
A room for two.
Did you make a reservation?
Number 12 is a doubIe.
Does it have a bathroom?
We'II take it.
Any Iuggage?
I show you the way.
Excuse me, Madame.
I'II go first.
It's very quiet here.
Thank you. That's for you.
A nice IittIe room.
MicheIet's a good name.
I'd better unpack and bathe.
There goes my Iast pair!
I'd better run over
and Iet them know I'm here.
I won't be Iong.
I need stockings
and a ticket for tonight.
Don't forget my stockings!
- HeIIo, sir. Any Iuggage?
- No Iuggage.
- Your suite is aII ready.
- No need, I can't stay.
We'II take care of your Iuggage.
- Do you want to rest?
- I'm not staying.
- How are you, oId man?
- Fine and you?
Want to freshen up, first?
I'm aIright.
When I invited you,
I was sure you'd refuse.
But they know we're friends,
so I had to try.
Is your wife here?
She's in Paris.
Give her my best.
Let me introduce you.
Father Cote', our weIfare chairman.
PIeased to meet you.
Mr. Bertrand, our theatre manager.
Mme LaIoix's in charge of...
CuIturaI exchanges.
... tonight's afair.
Our cuIturaI director
and his wife.
Why the dinner?
Didn't you know?
Out here we squeeze
a ceIebrity dry, Iike a Iemon.
I must get my car fixed.
- WiII you be Iong?
- Five minutes!
Okay, I'II keep them busy
with the canape's.
Hurry back!
Don't forget my stockings...
ZibeIine...
Neamat stocKings
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry, we're cIosing.
I'd Iike to buy some stockings.
I bought you two pairs.
There are compIications...
A dinner for me.
Then I'II eat next door,
but stay awhiIe.
ImpossibIe,
they're aII waiting for me.
AIright, never mind.
You understand, don't you?
See you Iater.
My ticket!
Just buy one at the theatre.
Which one?
- The CapitoI, I think.
- But where is it?
Ask the hoteI peopIe.
I wonder why I'm here.
- You brought it back?
- They're too busy.
I swear that if it were me...
Come on.
You're at the head of the tabIe,
a Iady on each side.
Are you married?
I am.
Why isn't your wife with you?
My wife's home.
Oysters or potage,
take your choice.
Do you know Reims?
Any chiIdren?
A reaI interview!
I'II answer you one by one.
I have a chiId.
I've never been here.
And you're Ieaving tonight?
What about the smiIe of Reims?
OnIy Andre' Gide couId get me
back to the movies.
Last time
was to see CharIie ChapIin.
To fix a cIock, he opened it
with a can-opener.
I first saw the sea
at Paramount.
Last month, we had Daninos.
You know him?
Not personaIIy. How was it?
It was awfuI!
Everyone was Iate, it rained
and my dress was a disaster.
- Was it the coIour?
- No.
It made me Iook terribIy fat.
The afair was a reaI disaster!
Don't worry if our pubIic
seems coId,
we never appIaud.
Did you know Gide?
- He seIIs books.
- I aIso happen to admire Gide.
I met him twice,
the second time,
shortIy before his death.
TeII us about it.
I'd rather save it for my speech
so as not to repeat myseIf.
As you Iike.
A young Iady to see you, sir.
Are you sure?
I'm sorry to bother you, but since
I can't stay for your taIk,
wouId you autograph this book
for me?
Of course.
My name's Christiane Duchant.
With a ''t'', that's right.
Thank you very much.
He doesn't Iet anyone waIk over him.
Next year, it'II take us 72 minutes
to go to Paris by train.
Excuse me.
I must check the box-ofice.
Thank you for coming, Mr. Lachenay.
Thanks to you, we're soId out.
A rare event in this movie crisis!
Forgive me if I'm bIunt,
but I'm a businessman.
Tonight's big turnout
isn't for Gide, it's for you!
They've seen you on TV.
Time to go.
This way.
Take this.
I must Ieave you now
to check the haII.
See you Iater, at the reception.
I'm sorry I can't stay for it.
I must be back in Paris tonight.
What a pity.
Thanks again for coming.
And good Iuck!
Put your coat down.
I make a quick announcement.
We turn the Iights on.
Then you waIk on.
We shake hands.
Then you're on your own!
AIright.
ShaII I go?
The friendship of a great man
is a godsend. There's no need
to introduce Pierre Lachenay.
But I'd Iike to thank him
for coming here tonight.
Ladies and gentIemen,
I've Iearned
that men's unhappiness arises
from the inabiIity
to stay quietIy in their own room.
Had I recaIIed this
a few hours ago,
I wouIdn't be here now.
FrankIy,
I'm rather nervous.
I'm not a cinema expert,
... but I had the great pIeasure
to meet Andre' Gide twice.
One ticket pIease.
No more seats.
- The baIcony?
- We're aII soId out.
Can I stand inside if I pay?
That's impossibIe, MademoiseIIe.
- ReaIIy?
- AbsoIuteIy. I'm sorry.
This Iady insists on going in.
AII seats were soId out in advance.
You can cIose up now.
Everybody has read or heId
a book from the famous
''PIe'iade'' coIIection
which pubIishes the entire work
of an author in one tome.
Gide got the idea
for this coIIection
by reading the BibIe.
He said:
''My dear Lachenay,
''our taIk today wiII heIp you
read my books.
''Am I the man required?''
I reassured Andre' Gide.
But time fIies...
In concIusion,
I shouId Iike to read
a few of Gide's finaI words:
''I ofer no doctrine,
''I refuse to give advice
''and I shy away from discussions.
''But I know that many today
are searching
''for someone to beIieve in.
''To them, I say,
''trust those who seek the truth,
''beware of those who've fount it,
question everything,
''but beIieve in yourseIf.''
And now, Marc AIIegret's fiIm.
Great speech!
- You think so?
- ReaIIy. It was perfect.
Listen, in pIaYing this,
Your fist concern
is to generate emotion...
Our friend Gide is great.
- He Iooks Iike a wrestIer.
- True.
... not mereIY Your own,
but for others as weII.
Now, do it again,
no, just from this part on.
Do you want to see the rest?
Not reaIIy.
Let's have a drink.
Can You imagine me a provinciaI...
buried out here?
But I've kept my studio in Paris.
Did you forget something?
Let's go.
You taIked but I'm thirsty.
Bertrand shouId have a bar
in his theatre...
- Let me pass.
- Don't run away Iike this.
... but he won't Iisten to me.
After nine, it's tough
to get a drink around here.
There was a pIace,
but it's cIosed now.
The owner had a fight
with the cops.
Do you want one?
Nothing doing out here,
but inside those waIIs, who knows?
You remember that girI,
the recIuse of Poitiers?
I think there's a pIace nearby.
I've been there once, a month ago.
ShaII we go in?
Friends first.
What do you want?
I'II have a beer.
Two draft beers.
It'II Iimit the damage.
The fiIm runs over an hour.
Cigarette?
What's wrong?
Too hot in here.
You seem upset.
CIe'ment, Iet's get out of here.
You do Iook awfuI.
Can I finish your beer?
Let's go back to the hoteI.
A IittIe nap wiII do you good.
You'II be peacefuI in your room.
Those jerks wouId demoraIize anyone.
Getting you here
is Iike throwing pearIs to swine!
Your speech was reaIIy great
and I mean it.
In fact, aII your work
is first-rate.
AII they do here is eat!
Lachenay in Reims? Presto, a dinner!
They eat their heads of, for free!
That's why they go for cuIture.
Damn that shoeIace.
I'II try and fix it.
It's the second time tonight.
To every man, his own woes.
Mine's shoeIaces.
I hate them so,
I aIways wear moccasins.
But I put my best shoes on,
in your honour
and they're kiIIing me!
You might say I'm caught in a pinch!
Remember Lachere's wedding? At noon,
the bride hadn't even turned up.
What are you doing here?
That's a good question.
Forgive me, I've got to shake
that pest. I won't be Iong.
I couIdn't figure out
where you'd gone.
You vanished into thin air,
Iike a fIying saucer.
To quote the defeated generaI:
''I searched high and Iow
and aII around me,
''at a Ioss to know
what happened to my army.''
God, you Iook awfuI!
This town shuts down at 9 p.m.
In Spain and ItaIy,
peopIe stay out haIf the night.
In France, we're so stingy
we go to bed earIy
just to save eIectricity.
You Iook reaIIy tired.
You'd better have a nap
at the hoteI.
I'II pick you up for the reception.
I'm not staying for it.
Do they know?
They'II be sore as heII.
Not at aII. I toId them about it.
I didn't know that.
In that case,
I don't have to go either.
- Are you driving to Paris?
- Right now.
Great! Take me aIong.
- To Paris?
- Yes, I'II go with you.
AIright.
Is your car here?
I'II get my bag, wait here.
And bye-bye everyone!
OnIy be a minute!
Get dressed. Let's get out of here.
This town is getting on my nerves.
We're Ieaving!
NicoIe, did you hear me?
Go if you want to. I'II stay.
What do you mean?
I mean I'm fed up.
Don't you want to go?
Go yourseIf!
I'II take a train to Paris
in the morning.
Just Ieave me aIone.
Go away!
I didn't ask to come.
It was entireIy your idea
and then, you're ashamed of me.
It was aII so humiIiating.
That creep trying to pick me up
in the street.
I feIt humiIiated too.
But what couId I do?
I was trapped.
It's been a reaI nightmare.
PIease forgive me, my darIing.
You want us to stay here tonight?
No, Iet's Ieave right away.
I'II run down to pay the biII.
The biII, pIease.
Right now? They're aII asIeep.
I can't do biIIs. Wait tiII morning.
Sorry, but I must Ieave now.
I'II heIp you with the biII.
We'II work it out.
How much for the room?
40 francs.
Add a few extras...
that's about 80 Francs.
Here's 120!
Anyway, you've got my address.
Let me carry your bags.
Never mind. We'II manage.
Damn it, we have to pass
the Grand HoteI.
See that guy?
With the tan coat?
God!
He says: ''I'II go too!''
What did you do?
I was stunned, but when he went
inside, I ran of Iike a thief.
Crazy, isn't it?
Forgive me.
Sacha Guitry said:
''When they yawn,
''it's time to say bye-bye.''
- Is the CoIiniere good?
- According to the guide, yes.
They say it's an ice inn
with separate cabins.
That's right, come cIoser darIing.
Go to sIeep.
Forgive me.
Here's the bathroom.
Do you need anything?
No, thank you.
You asIeep?
You're tired.
When my brother bet
he'd shave his head
with his eIectric razor,
Papa toId him not to come back
tiII his hair grew in.
So he Ieft home.
And why did you Ieave?
To take the airIine job.
- How'd you get it?
- By passing a test.
I know a IittIe Spanish,
I studied EngIish in London.
WeII, nearby. For a year.
- Any friends there?
- Not at first.
I was homesick, but my parents
made me stay.
- Later, I made friends.
- Why couIdn't you go home?
In Bordeaux,
I'd had a crush on a boy
and my parents
wanted me to forget him.
Was he your first?
No, the first was in London.
An EngIishman?
No, a Frenchman.
Did you Iove him?
No, it was siIIy,
it didn't Iast.
And after him?
Two or three.
They didn't mean anything.
I was too young, I guess.
But the first time
it mattered physicaIIy
was Iast year.
I didn't want him
but he was aIways around.
FinaIIy, he aImost raped me.
It's strange. He thriIIed me,
yet, I didn't Iove him.
It didn't Iast very Iong.
I feIt squeamish,
as if I'd been soiIed.
When I got home, I'd take a bath.
It was ridicuIous.
I even hated
the cIothes he'd touched.
What did he work at?
Gosh, this is heavy!
Is he in aviation?
Yes, a piIot. You've met Frank.
I knew it!
I sensed it before our dinner
in Lisbon.
And when we met?
There was no one.
And Frank?
I broke of with Frank months ago.
- Others?
- No one at aII.
I Iike to make Iove,
yet I can go without for months.
Do you mind me taIking about it?
Are you sure?
I don't reaIIy know Frank,
but I hate his type.
What do you mean?
He's too sure of himseIf.
Not reaIIy,
but I don't care enough to defend
him. Anyway, why taIk about Frank?
Wait!
In profiIe.
Look at me.
One more.
I don't Iike your Iegs Iike that.
Don't cross them.
Let me show you.
Like this.
There.
My Iegs hurt!
One more with the automatic shutter.
Now, you and me together.
See, I'm Iucky at games.
Have you aIways been
so interested in women?
Funny, it's onIy since I know you.
I must be stimuIating.
Where do you go in summer?
My kids Iove Brittany.
The cIeaner can get it out.
Look, Pierre.
See that woman?
I used to be a bIonde, reaI cute!
You don't beIieve me?
Now, Iook there.
What do you see?
The same bIouse.
Right.
Leopard skin.
Women who wear them
Iike making Iove.
There's something wrong.
What is it?
Nothing.
I know you.
I can teII you're worried.
Something I did?
Something I said?
It's awkward...
I know, you've got to caII
your wife.
That's it.
CouIdn't you just say so?
I'II be outside.
TeII me when you're finished.
Connect me with Passy 42-70.
You're aIright, Franca?
Yes, and You?
I'm fine,
but something came up.
They wanted a repeat performance
so I had to stay over.
I'II be home tonight.
You caIIing from Reims?
Yes, Reims.
ReaIIY?
I caIIed Reims two nights ago
and was toId You"d just Ieft
for paris.
I'II caII you tomorrow.
Do you Iove me?
Yes.
Why won't you say it?
Because you don't Iike
to speII it out, is that it?
That's it exactIy.
Don't forget me.
I know, you were
with a girI.
Answer me.
Kanayan toId me his articIe
wouIdn't be ready
in time.
So I caIIed the hoteI in Reims,
you'd Ieft the night before.
You were driving, I became frantic.
A Iot you care!
How couId you treat me that way?
Listen, Franca.
Was that asking too much,
a few days with you?
We couId have gone of right
after the Iecture.
I've waited for five years.
You exaggerate!
No, I've counted them.
I was upset. I needed to be aIone.
If you'd onIy said that to me.
You'd never understand it!
Not so Ioud.
Sabine never wakes up.
Maybe not, but the nurse is here.
After aII, I might want
to go out.
I need some fun too!
Franca, I'm tired.
So am I,
but it's high time we taIked.
Say something!
If I'm wrong, say so.
I'm not up to taIking just now.
If there was woman...
teII me.
It wouId hurt far Iess if I knew.
- I was aIone!
- I don't beIieve you.
I don't care!
Thanks a Iot!
You expect me to be kind?
In what way?
Be considerate.
What for, you're not sick.
Yes, thanks to you, I am sick!
I haven't sIept in two nights.
Pierre, maybe we shouId separate.
I'm serious.
AIright, I'II go.
I didn't mean aII that.
I'm upset. I was nasty.
Look, I propose
we try an experiment.
No fighting for a month.
After that we decide.
We've experimented for years.
I won't forgive this.
HeIIo, Dominique.
Yes, I sIept here.
- How did you get your fIat?
- The Chaude agency.
Better caII them,
I've got to find a fIat.
I'm going out for cofee.
Madame Lachenay.
I'II take it in there.
Did You sIeep weII?
WeII, I was up aII night.
This is just to thanK You
for waIKing out on me.
I"d forgive anything but that.
OdiIe"s cousin wiII act
as mY IawYer.
- As what?
- MY divorce IawYer!
I suggest You get someone too.
WhY waste time?
I won"t be aIone Iong.
Your bags are aII pacKed.
picK them up anY time.
I caIIed your ofice,
but you'd gone.
You can't stay.
My father's in town.
He's on his way here.
And I'II be away tiII Friday.
Let's have dinner Friday.
I've got important news.
Important? TeII me now.
No, you're rushed
and this takes time.
Come on,
you teII me you've got big news
and now you won't taIk. TeII me.
Nothing doing!
Just teII me
if it's something pIeasant.
I'm not sure.
But it is serious and important.
What is it?
I meant to expIain it properIy.
It's just this...
My wife and I are separating
by mutuaI agreement.
Listen,
there's my dad, you'd better run.
See you Friday.
We won't meet at the airport,
but here.
AIright.
Excuse me, sir.
- HeIIo, daddy!
- HeIIo, darIing.
I'm aImost ready.
See, I waIk Iike a Iady.
My Iawyer's waiting
to hear from yours.
It's not that urgent.
Yes, it is.
I don't Iike ambiguous situations.
We can't taIk here.
Then, Iet's go to the study.
Sit down.
I'd rather stand.
I'm taking this one.
That one too.
Your bags are ready,
they're in the haII.
I didn't know where to send them.
Where do you Iive?
I sIeep in the ofice.
I pIan to take a fIat.
You fooI!
- Listen Franca!
- I won't Iisten.
What got into you?
Weren't you happy here?
- What's got into you?
- Not in front of the girI.
Now he thinks about her.
Go pIay with MademoiseIIe.
Sabine, go and see MademoiseIIe.
Come here, Sabine!
Kanayan caIIed.
I gave him the ofice number.
You were out,
so he rang here.
I toId him
you weren't Iiving here anymore.
What eIse couId I teII him?
The truth, we decided to separate.
We decided to separate!
You'd Iike me to say that.
Don't count on it.
I'II say that you Ieft me.
Isn't it true, you were fed up?
CaIm down, Franca.
You're a Iouse!
Forgive me, Pierre.
I didn't mean to do that,
but I'm so tired.
Come here, sit by me.
I'm sorry for aII I said.
You must Ioathe me.
No Franca, I Ioathe myseIf.
Kiss me.
We'II pIay in your room.
This wiII go to the cIeaner.
I'm taking her out.
Bye, darIing.
Bye-bye, daddy.
Come on, we're Ieaving.
They probabIy forgot something.
I'd better come back Iater.
No, stay here.
Anyway, Pierre's Ieaving.
I must be going.
CaII me tonight. I'd Iike that.
ReaIIy?
You got some champagne from Reims.
Just keep it in the ceIIar.
Here's the Foujita.
What for? I gave it to you.
Take it back.
I don't want it, it's yours.
Keep it.
Want to come back for supper,
or to sIeep,
or just for supper?
It won't work, you know
with aII that's happened.
I'm sorry OdiIe, I can't go
with you, I don't feeI weII.
What a fooI I am!
I shouId have known better.
What's Pierre done to you?
What did he want?
That's what he wanted!

Franca, you've got to caIm down.
You need some sIeep.
Let me have a sIeeping piII?
You said you'd be right down.
I'd better stay.
Franca's very upset
over Pierre. I'm afraid
she might do something fooIish.
In the pIane today,
In the pIane today,
we ran into a storm.
One of the passengers,
an American,
was scared.
He drank so much whiskey,
he went berserk. He drove us aII
crazy, it was reaI wiId!
Don't taIk so Ioud,
peopIe are staring.
You're charming tonight.
Did your dad enjoy Paris?
Did he have a good time?
I don't know.
I'm tired. PIease take me home.
Why? The program starts
in ten minutes.
Take me home.
You were so eager to come here.
WeII, now I'm tired.
I Ieave tomorrow.
Mad at me?
You're sure?
Positive.
I wasn't very good company, I know,
but you must understand,
I've had a pretty rough week.
Franca... the separation...
I thought you both wanted
this separation.
Yes, of course,
but it's not so easy
after 15 years.
You toId her about me?
No. I thought
the Iater, the better.
I don't agree.
If it was me, I'd prefer the truth
even if it's another girI.
You know the score.
I didn't see it that way.
Speaking as a man...
I teII you, it's a mistake.
You may be right. I'II teII her,
but it won't be easy.
You see, it's been hard on me too,
harder than I thought.
We're used to each other
and there's Sabine.
I'II miss seeing her every day.
If that's how it is,
you sure goofed!
You can give Sabine
some caIves Iiver for Iunch...
I'II get the door!
And some mashed potatoes.
The suit from the cIeaner's.
HoId on.
We found this stub in the pocket.
Thank you.
photo enIargement
This is the Iiving room.
There, my study and the Iibrary.
That wiII be our room,
with Sabine's next to it
for when she visits us.
I'II get an extra room
for the nanny.
So you want to marry me?
If I say yes, you'II taIk
to my father. Is that it?
Listen to me,
I've discovered
some facts of Iife IateIy.
There's a misunderstanding.
When you Iooked me up in Paris,
I was pIeased because
I thought you might misjudge me
after what happened in Lisbon.
On the way here, I guessed...
but now that it's out,
I've got to speak up.
It's just as weII
you bought it to a head...
It was aII happening too quickIy.
Because it just wouId have
dragged on
to wind up the same way.
What's the point?
In the restaurant Iast night,
I irritated you, I couId teII.
You aImost hated me.
It's true.
To pIan a wedding when you reach
that point, it makes no sense!
I know you're hurt.
I feeI bad, too.
If you'd Iike, we couId
meet from time to time.
I'm truIy sorry.
Bye, Pierre.
- How much is it?
- 14 francs.
Need some heIp?
How about a IittIe waIk?
Why hurry home?
We can go to a cafe',
or up to my pIace.
Who the heII are you?
What are you after?
Do aII women go for you?
You take them to the country?
IrresistibIe, a Don Juan...
God's gift to women?
Ever take a good Iook at yourseIf?
Come and have a Iook.
- Look again!
- Leave me aIone!
Take Sabine to Madame OdiIe's.
Look Mummy,
I've finished it aII of!
After her homework?
No, right after she eats.
And the homework?
She'II do it at Madame OdiIe's.
AIright, Madame.
A token, pIease.
OdiIe?
I want to thank you for everything.
I'm of for a rest tomorrow.
Ask Franca,
can I see Sabine before I go?
As you wish, Pierre.
But it's such a mess.
What can I do about it now?
It's too Iate.
Since you'II be seeing her,
wouId you
Iet me know?
Let you know what?
If you can stiII change your mind?
If you reaIIy want to go back
to Franca,
I'm sure she'd agree,
if you ask her yourseIf.
You may be right, OdiIe.
I'II do it next week.
Why? The sooner the better.
CaII her right now.
Now?
I'd rather wait awhiIe.
What for? Do you think
she'II sit around for 10 years?
Pierre, I beg you,
don't put it of.
You're probabIy right.
I guess I'II do that.
- Another token, pIease.
- One more?
That's right.
I'm going out.
WiII you Iunch here?
Madame Lachenay's pIace.
Is this you, MademoiseIIe?
- My wife, pIease.
- She just this minute went out.
Look in the haII.
HoId on, sir. I'II see.
No, she's Ieft the house.
Then, she"s in the street.
CaII her from the window.
I'II have a Iook.
I'm sorry, but her car
just puIIed out. Any message?
TeII Madame that I phoned
and wiII caII back Iater.
I"II teII her, sir.
That's aII.
CaII the poIice!
