Let go of me! Let go of me!
Let go of me!
'Kuruthi'
[The Holy Slaughter]
Please don't slaughter Manikkutti, Daddy.
Please don't!
Zuhru...
We reared Manikkutti
for the holy sacrifice, right?
If we go back on our commitment,
God will punish us!

How will they be able to go back then?
Peace be unto you, Ibru.
-And unto you be peace!
The bridge collapsed
around Magrib prayer time.
They must have crossed the
bridge before that.
-Who?
-The cops.
-And?
-And they came to the shop.
They enquired about that boy.
Which boy?
Didn't you see the
newspaper the day before?
The boy who stabbed that shopkeeper
to death, on the strike day.
That boy!
Where is this country headed to?
Only the devil's arrival is left now!
So, did the cops find that boy?
No idea!
No one has seen
the cops after that, either.
Since the bridge is damaged, they couldn't
have gone back through that route.
They might have gone through the forest,
to cross the hanging bridge at Kenachal.
You're the only one
who knows those places.
None of us have any
idea about that route.
Ibru, you're the only one who's
staying so remotely now.
Suma, as well.
Everyone else shifted
elsewhere after the landslide.
Exactly!
I often wonder,
why you can't come
here and stay amidst humans!
I have so many memories attached
to that place, Gafoor.
I'm unable to leave them behind.
'O Allah! Make me
among those who repent,
and among those who
purify themselves.'
'O Allah! Open the doors
of Your mercy for me'
Peace be unto you.
-And unto you be peace.
'Allah hears whoever praises Him'
'Allah is the Greatest!'
'Allah is the Greatest!'
'Allah is the Greatest!'
'Allah is the Greatest!'
One group has the
arrogance of power.
And the other group has the
courage of having nothing to lose.
In between all this,
there are poor folks like us,
whom no one cares about.
Everything described about the
Judgement Day is coming true, isn't it?
When the world is about to end,
it is said that Allah will
test us Muslims.
The death anniversary of your daughter
and wife is coming, right?
Yes.
Don't you get sleep nowadays?
My mind is always disturbed.
I'm really scared.
What are you so scared about?
About afterlife.
When the angels interrogate me in my grave,
will I attain heaven?
Only if you have lived
by God's commands.
Sometimes, in certain things,
I don't understand
what He has commanded.
My mind is full of doubts.
Doubts are a part of faith.
That's the sign of a true believer.
When you have doubts,
as the Prophet has advised,
do the prayer of Isthikkarah
(seeking counsel)!
And at that moment, what occurs
to you as the right thing to do...
That is God's answer to you.
I have only one wish.
I want to see my daughter again.
I am sure that she
reached heaven.
I must reach there too.
Hello!
Yes!
Didn't you go for work today?
How can I?
I have to finish the work
around here first, right?
Suma told me many times...
...to leave it midway
and get going for work.
Despite being a non-pay day, you don't
get to be on the ground, you monkey!
Your dad's the monkey! Mr. Moosa!
Oh, God! He's not a monkey.
He's a wolf!
A bloody old wolf!
Did you check the wasp nest?
That's why I went there.
It's quite huge, man.
And the window near it
can't be closed either.
So I didn't want to take a risk.
Where's Suma?
Is she at home?
She has gone to your
house with lunch.
What's with her now?
She has been cooking all the time
for the past two days!
We're relishing our luck anyway!
Ever since that
issue at the temple,
her devotion craze has doubled!
This cooking craze
began along with that.
Every week,
she has a different craze!
I wonder what it would be,
next week!
Anyway, climb carefully!
-Okay.
Do you have any doubt?
That's how it is.
I can't clean up your piss and shit.
I have other jobs to do.
You wretch!
You're not my seed!
If that's true, I'll celebrate by
cracking firecrackers here.
Forget firecrackers.
It's your face that's going to crack.
I'll kick it in,
just like a fibre bumper!
Just try!
Then you'll understand
that the times have changed!
Rasool, don't talk like this.
He's your father, after all.
If he's my father, he should
behave like my father.
I'm not your father.
I'm your nemesis!
See!!
Our mother died a miserable death because
of his alcoholism and marijuana addiction.
He ruined his children's lives too.
Even when he has one foot in the grave,
he won't give us peace...
Don't think that I'll die anytime soon.
If you want peace at home, get a job!
What job is there to do?
Go plough the fields!
If you can't do that,
drill that phone of yours to your face!!
And keep rubbing your thing!
It will feel really good! Get lost!
Have some food and go.
Do you want money?
Who are you to give me money all the time?
My sister-in-law?
-Where are you going?
-To Ahamed's shop.
Did you fill the form
for the exam re-attempt?
I'll do it once I am back.
When will that be?
I'll throw that carrom board
in some ditch! Tell Ahamed.
The curry is a bit spicy.
Don't have too much gravy.
It's just spicy, right?
What I get here is much worse!
I saw a lot of clothes piled up
in the room.
Shall I wash them?
Suma...
That's not necessary.
I'll wash them tomorrow.
Don't touch my clothes!
You spoiled two shirts of mine
by washing them on the stone!
Idiot! Will you stop it and get lost?
All his drumming and hammering!
The glass on the front window is broken!
But you still have to mess around me
and puncture my eardrums!
Four of them will be fine.
Last time when the coconut prices went up,
Preman sold all of them.
It didn't occur to him
that we would need it for cooking.
How's his drinking now?
It's still the same.
He comes back on all fours daily.
And then at night,
he starts crying,
thinking about Ramani.
For Preman to move on,
he needs a partner.
But he's more interested
in getting me married again.
I didn't get anything but trouble
from my marriage.
That wasn't the case with Preman.
And you, Ibru.
How long are you going
to manage alone, Ibru?
Why should I worry?
I have you, right?
You're not planning
to get married again either.
Yeah, right!
Don't bank on me doing
the chores around here forever.
I can't afford the daily wage
that your Jaleel sir is paying you.
Yeah!
There's an easy way out, Ibru.
If you want it.
I don't mind reciting two lines
of the Kalima in front of a Musaliyar,
as long as I can light a lamp and pray
in front of my Goddess in my room.
No one will know, Ibru.
No one will see it either.
Stop it, Suma.
That will be even more expensive for me.
Expense?
Is that what you're really worried about?
Suma, we...
Whatever path we both take,
it should be the right one.
That's all I want.
Right for whom, Ibru?
For you... or for your God?
Listen...
America and Israel are the ones
playing behind all this.
Why is that so?
They have given out contracts
to stop our growth.
They know that
if they confront us directly,
they will be too busy putting
out the fire on their tails.
-What happened in Afghanistan?
-What happened?
What happened in Iraq?
And now, it's in Europe.
They have started facing the heat
there too!
There's no point getting goosebumps
seeing what real men are doing
in Afghanistan, Iraq and Europe.
First, the people around us
should understand
that it will burn if they touch us.
What are you all saying?
We should be able to stand with
those who believe in democracy,
instead of caste or religion.
They are the ones we should strengthen.
The rest is all just blown up hot air.
-Ibru, are you done for the day?
-Yes.
-Ahamed, get me a tea.
-Yes.
Ahamed, I'm leaving. Add it to my tab.
Kareem!
I'm coming with you!
-I heard a news.
-What?
The son of the shopkeeper
who died on the strike day?
He is into 'that'!
-'That'?
-Terrorism!
He has vowed that he won't spare
the boy who killed his father, apparently.
-Where did you hear this from?
-Someone told me.
Has the bridge been repaired?
No way!
How do they move such a big tree?
It's a risky task!
I've told you many times,
not to shout out our thoughts
and ideologies in public places.
When you talk, you should be aware
of the place and time.
Why didn't you come
for the morning prayer?
I woke up late.
I wasn't feeling good at all.
This fervour for debating
for our community,
should be shown in praying
and fasting as well.
I feel restless.
To just stand and watch
all these atrocities inflicted upon us...
I can't bear it, Brother.
Shouldn't we do something?
This is not the time to be hasty.
God is testing us.
Soon,
our time will come.
Hey!
Give me 50 Rupees.
My hard-earned money
is not for you to spend at toddy shops!
-I worked so hard here today! -Good
for you! It's your own property, right?
You're both at it again?
-What's this?
-Papaya.
Nasser gave it.
Hey! Just tell her.
-To give me some...
-I won't give him money.
I had asked you
to go for work today, right?
What's the point in saying all that now?
I'm leaving. If I stay here,
I'll have to listen to her cribbing.
Don't stay until dark.
The snake from the temple
is roaming around.
Yeah, right! As if snakes are roaming
around with Aadhaar cards on their necks,
displaying their names and addresses.
Get lost!
Are you going home?
No. I have to go
and see Zuhra and Zeenath.
It will be one year
since it happened, tomorrow.
"The bird of my memories
is searching for a sky in its mud-nest"
"And the dark clouds
are raining down as tears"
"The star in the sky is blinking
its eye and looking at me"
"It's weeping forever"
"To see that world, on my prayer mat,"
"I am craving for it,
and that time has passed"
"The story ended in half a minute,
before I knew it"
Brother...
"Tears and laments happen in unison"
"I cross the path of embers,
carrying the burden of memories"
"When and where can I attain salvation?"
"With a raging fire inside,
as a guardian flame for the night"
"Will you come again as the drop of water
that disappears in the summer?"
"Will you come again,
before my eyes?"
"The bird of my memories
is searching for a sky in its mud-nest"
"And the dark clouds
are raining down as tears"
"The star in the sky is blinking
its eye and looking at me"
"It's weeping forever"
[Rajinikanth's 'Billa' playing on TV]
What to do!
It's not your day!
If you try to escape from here...
I know that I'll lose my life.
D.S.P. Sir...
There's plenty of money in this.
If you let me escape,
the millions in this suitcase
would be yours.
Shut up!
Come here with the suitcase.
Excuse me.
You've seen the suitcase,
but you haven't seen the money.
Even if you work hard all your life,
you can't see so much money together.
This is all for you.
After that, it's your choice.
Take it!
[Movie continues on TV]
'Dump the Genie', you idiots!
-What?
-What?
-'Dump the Genie'?
-Oh! That?
When we used to smuggle sandalwood,
if the forest guards chased the vehicle,
it's a signal
to dump the goods and escape!
'Dump the Genie'
Well...
You have no plans
to cook anything tonight?
But you say that everything I cook
tastes like crap!
Wow! My son who takes
everything I say so seriously!
Suma will bring dinner.
I see...
Aren't you ashamed...
...to slurp up what a woman
from another house brings?
What should I do? Should I say no?
Why can't you marry her?
That's funny!
Will your problem be solved
if I marry her?
What's the doubt in that?
If you marry her and bring her here,
then cooking for us is not her generosity!
It is her duty!
[Knock on door]
Give me all your mobile phones.
Phones!
I don't have a phone.
Go and sit in that corner.
Do you have a license for this?
I used to, long time back, Sir.
It's been ages since I renewed it.
One of its pins is not working now.
Where are the bullets?
It's been around 20 years
since I bought a bullet, Sir.
Hello?
This is Sub-Inspector Sathyan.
Let that be.
Did any of the constables call?
Yes.
Someone attacked us in the dark,
on our way back.
The constables scrammed
in different directions.
Them?
There were around three...
...or four of them, for sure.
It must be him. Who else?
Hanging bridge?
Kenachal?
But right now, through the forest...
How much time will it take?
Okay.
What?
Tsk!
Even the mobile range is minimum here.
Okay, okay.
Okay! Okay!
Hang up!
Is the bridge under repair?
-Yes.
-How far is Kenachal from here?
If you go by foot through the forest,
it might take 3 hours.
Is there a hanging bridge at Kenachal?
Yes.
I'll give you the short version.
My name is Sathyan.
I'm the Town Sub-Inspector.
He's an accused in a murder case.
On our way back after capturing him,
some strangers attacked us.
The other cops who were with me
scrammed in different directions.
Who did this?
That doesn't matter.
I have only one thing to tell you.
The policemen from the station,
are set to reach Kenachal
by dawn tomorrow.
Since the roads are waterlogged,
they will take some time.
So, tonight...
both me and him, will have to stay here!
Do any of you have any objection?
Huh?
Okay.
Now, one more thing.
None of you will be permitted
to step out tonight.
These mobile phones will be with me
for the time being.
Isn't he the one who murdered
that poor shopkeeper?
-What's your name?
-Rasool.
If you talk again,
I'll knock your teeth out!
Yes, that was me!
I'll do it again, if necessary.
Bloody fucker!
Lower your eyes, you bastard!
Lower your eyes, I said!
Are there any other houses
in the neighbourhood?
There's one more house, down the hill.
Are they Muslims?
No. They are Hindus.
[Phone ringing]
No need for any more calls tonight.
So you don't trust us, Sir?
No!
They knew the exact time and route
through which we were bringing him.
I'm sure one or more of the locals
is connected to them.
They had the gall to mess with the police!
I can't take any risk!
[Phone notifications]
-Shucks!
I don't even know whether the cops
who were with me are still alive.
He has made up his mind
to play off the deep end!
Who?
[Knock on door]
[Knock on door]
-Who is it?
-It's me.
-Why have you locked the door?
-Sir...
It's food!
Ibru!
Rasool!
What is it, Ibru?
Why have you locked up everything?
Give me your phone.
Your mobile phone!
My phone is at home.
What's for dinner?
He didn't come here
after asking my permission.
Oh! Since he didn't ask,
you didn't say anything, did you?
He might be a policeman.
But for random people to come
and tent up here, is this a lodge?
Where can they go in this night, Suma?
So it's not like you don't eat beef!
Hey!
Just because there were some
isolated incidents in the north,
don't think whatever we say is stupid!
Isolated incidents, it seems!
Is that your justification to kill
poor drivers and shopkeepers?
I don't have to justify it.
If someone tries to crush
our beliefs, we won't stand idle.
You killed an innocent, poor old man...
What did he crush?
I didn't intend to kill him.
He started hurling abuses at us,
refusing to shut his shop.
There was a tussle.
And it happened in the heat of the moment.
Quite natural!
But what rights did you have
to make him shut his shop?
Rights?
A bit rich, coming from people
who are known...
...for protecting people's rights
around the world, isn't it?
-Don't get me talking.
-Shut up!
-What are you...
-You too!
Do you stay alone?
No, Sir. I have a brother.
Does he have a vehicle?
He used to have a bike, Sir.
It got buried in last year's landslide.
[praying]
[Door opens]
We'll spend the night in this room.
The window of the other room
doesn't fully close.
Okay.
There was a lot of destruction
in this area, right?
Both our families,
were destroyed in it, Sir.
Her sister-in-law,
my daughter-in-law and granddaughter...
We lost all of them!
Did it happen here?
No.
At the slope of the neighbouring hill.
They had all gone for a wedding
eve function at a house there.
24 lives perished that night.
Hmm... Remember seeing it on TV.
After the initial hullabaloo,
everyone forgot about us.
The Government, media and the public.
We are like a flaccid wiener.
Not useful to oneself,
or others.
There's an angle between its barrels?
It's designed in a way that both
bullets will converge to strike...
100-120 metres away at the same point.
What were you working as, earlier?
Dad was a jeep driver.
That's not the whole deal.
I was with a landlord in Mysore.
My main job
was sandalwood smuggling and hunting!
I have even buried corpses in the forest.
Can you shut up?
Why? Will Sir put me in jail?
I'll be more than happy then!
At least I'll get food on time!
I want to use the toilet.
It's outside, Sir.
No way, Rasool!
Whatever you say,
I can't kick them out in the night.
If that son of a bitch stays here tonight,
I'll slit his throat myself!
Rasool, isn't he just a child?
Child? Him?
-He's old enough to kill a man.
-Shut your mouth!
This is my house.
I'll decide who comes or goes.
Do whatever you want, if you dare!
At least my doubt whether you're a man,
will be settled today.
Sir...
Why don't you have
a sense of belonging, Sir?
After all, we're from
the same community, aren't we?
Sir...
I have a question for you as you're a cop
who strictly follows the law...
Who are the actual powerless ones
in this country?
These infiltrators?
Or us?
Save your speech
for some stupid WhatsApp group.
-Fuck!
-But Sir...
Just one question!
If the laws here are not at all beneficial
for the majority,
shouldn't we change those laws, Sir?
These guys are fooling us,
claiming to be the minority...
Enough! Get out!
What?
Sir, shall I go home?
Not tonight. You can go tomorrow morning.
Why, Sir? She won't tell anyone.
She's from our community.
Just a minute.
You...
We'll settle your scores one day!
If someone wants to use the toilet,
do it now. I'm going to close the door.
Sir, I won't tell anyone.
-Why should...
-I said, no!
No one is going anywhere.
Sir...
Her brother will be really worried.
Call him and tell him something.
Call him!
I think Preman hasn't left the toddy shop.
He will call back. Give it to me.
[buzz of wasps]
[Bike approaching]
[Bike approaching]
Ibru!
-Ibru!
-Yes?
Hey! It's me!
Open the door!
Why aren't any of you attending the phone?
Huh?
Ibru!
-[Knocking on door]
-Open the door.
[Knocking on door]
-Ibru!
-Who is with you?
Huh?
No one.
I am alone.
Why aren't you opening the door?
-Isn't Rasool here?
-I am here, Kareem!
Then open the door!
You haven't gone to bed yet?
What happened?
Nothing.
My phone got switched off.
And his was on silent mode.
Oh!
Why have you come here at this hour?
When I couldn't contact you all,
I was worried.
It was exactly one year ago, when...
I have to wake up early
in the morning, Kammu.
Yeah, I'm leaving.
Can I get some water, Rasool?
Sure.
How are you doing, Moosa?
I'm splendid!
Rasool, give him water.
Kareem has to leave.
That bike is not yours, is it?
-The bike?
-Oh! That's Laiq's.
Who is Laiq?
Me.
I am Laiq.
Peace be unto you.
And unto you be peace.
Didn't you say that you were alone?
Is it? Did I say so?
I'm on my way from Bangalore.
Only after reaching here,
I realised that I can't cross
the mountain pass on the bike tonight.
The bridge...
Can I stay here tonight?
My room has a leak.
Is it?
Do you want us to help?
Back when I was in my hometown,
I used to do roofing and tiling jobs.
So be it. Come back with a load of tiles
after the rains.
Okay.
Can I get something to eat?
I'm really hungry.
We already had dinner.
Still...
...there must be something left.
There was some leftover rice.
That's all.
Kammu, do you want tea or something?
No. I had dinner.
You've made new friends, huh?
The leak is in my house.
That's why I came here for the night.
Why can't you say that, Ibru?
It's our Kammu, right?
I'm going to bed. Feeling sleepy.
Preman will be back anytime now.
Ask him to close
the chicken coop when he's back.
She's their neighbour.
Once, at Montparnasse station...
...I was in Paris for a while...
...I happened to meet
this stubborn Neo-Nazi.
He had drawn a cartoon, supposedly
born out of his freedom of expression,
demeaning the Almighty, the Prophet.
He wanted to paste it
all over the walls there.
I broke his jawbone.
I was in jail for 3-4 months.
One day,
a white woman came to meet me there.
A Macedonian lady with cat-eyes.
She knew everything about me.
About my house...
my family...
my hometown...
my old police cases back
in my hometown...
After noting down all the details,
she looked at my face
and said with a smile,
"Nothing personal, dear."
"But you are no longer welcome...
...in this country."
When I saw her,
I was reminded of that woman.
All that she wanted to say,
she said without actually saying it.
When there's a stranger in the house,
a dirty dish on the table,
and the chicken coop is open,
can you believe
that she would just rush off to sleep?
Can you, Kammu?
That's right.
There's something fishy.
Kareem, take him along and get going.
-But Moosa...
-I don't want to see your face again.
Get out of my house!
I can understand your anger, Dad.
My Dad was also of the same age.
A devout man.
A man who never hurt even an ant.
But still,
a bastard infidel,
stabbed that poor man to death!
Do you know for what?
[Gun cocks]
[Door opens]
It's a really messed up day...
...isn't it, Sir?
Where's that other guy who was with you?
Is he dead?
I have come in search of someone.
Someone who believes...
he can do anything to anyone,
if his sentiments are hurt.
A son of a bitch!
What about you then?
You can do anything to anyone?
You are mistaken, Sir.
The issue here is not me,
or my father.
And this isn't a personal revenge either.
This is bigger than that.
You're even worse than that boy!
Where are my constables?
Have you killed them?
I haven't killed them.
Not yet.
Before they die
without getting water to drink,
let's strike a deal.
Go and bring your wife to strike a deal!
Don't mess around, Laiq!
I know your entire history!
I'll charge UAPA and put you
and all your boys behind bars!
None of you will see
the light of day again!
The fate of our boys...
...was sealed long back, Sir.
Sooner or later, our fate is inevitable.
What more can you scare
people like us with,
than what's already happening
around us now?
So you have decided to murder
that boy in cold blood!
No one has to know, Sir.
We haven't come here.
You haven't seen us.
He escaped from your custody.
No one has heard anything
about him after that.
What about them?
They will understand.
This is an issue which affects them too.
I know!
This is a house of faith!
Okay.
So here's the deal.
The entire police force
will be here any moment.
If you want to stay, you can.
[Door opens]
That shot you fired,
missed its mark, Sir.
We shall leave...
...with him!
Rasool! Come, let's go outside.
I'm not coming anywhere.
Oh, God!
[Gunshot]
Get out!
Get out of my house!
Ibru! Ibru, listen to me!
Kammu, don't ever come here again.
Just go!
-Ibrahim!
-Just go!
Shoot these dogs!
Laiq, come. Listen to me.
We'll figure something out.
Come!
Get out!
Get out, I say!
Take him away, Kammu.
Rasool, close the door.
Lock the door!
Bring your holy book.
Huh?
Bring the Quran!
What? What happened?
They killed him, didn't they?
They killed sir, didn't they?
Place your hand on it and promise me.
That you won't hand over that boy,
to anyone other than the police.
Swear upon it!
It's a dying man's last wish.
Don't be hesitant!
Four...
There are only four rounds left.
Use it judiciously.
-Okay?
-Yes.
You can go.
I'll stay with him here.
Verily we belong to Allah,
 and verily to Him do we return.
Brother!
Are you going to untie him?
Where is he going to run now, Rasool?
[Loud thud on window]
What's happening there?
Huh?
Ibru!
Oh, God!
It is said in the Surat-Ul-Baqarah...
...that God does not burden
a soul beyond it can bear.
If God is burdening you
with sufferings time and again,
it means that you have the strength
to bear it, more than others.
There are only three rounds
left in that gun now, right?
They will kill all of us.
Not everyone.
Just the two of us.
Ibru!
Ibru, just listen to me!
Let's take that cop
to the hospital before he bleeds to death.
Open the door!
And then?
Will you drag this boy out
and let your friend prey on him?
Ibru, don't complicate things.
We'll handle the cop and that boy.
You needn't worry about anything.
He's someone who killed one of ours!
One of yours?
What about me then?
If he has killed one of yours,
you're going to kill one of ours!
What has a woman got to do,
where men are talking?
Ibrahim!
Think about your afterlife!
Think about what's said in the Hadith.
Every believer will once face
a moment in life...
...when holding on to his faith,
will burn like ember!
Are you feeling the heat?
Tonight,
will you disown your faith?
Should he preserve his faith
by sacrificing a human life?
No.
I won't give him up.
If I'm making a mistake,
let God decide my fate!
I'm here to protect the glory
of the same God's will!
If you try to stop me,
I'll hack you down!
Each one of you!
I'm risking all our lives here.
For a murderer.
Ibru...
He is young, right?
When someone deliberately
desecrated his temple,
his people went crazy.
If this had happened in your mosque,
are you sure that Rasool
won't do something like this?
At least remember the promise you
made to the dead cop before he died.
-Rasool...
-Ibru!
This is the malady of our country now.
Are you educated?
I've finished my 12th grade.
I'm going for IIT coaching.
How did you end up in all this?
How can I not?
Everything is in shambles, right?
Can we pass an entrance test
in this country, without reservation?
So you just stabbed a man to death!
He asked for it, right?
You've been enjoying the privilege
of being the minority for too long!
Now you should realize
whom this country truly belongs to!
Oh!
Law and justice don't matter
to the majority, right?
Don't you talk about law and justice!
Compared to what Shah Jahan did back
in his day,
we're far better!
Who? Our barber Shah Jahan?
Mughal emperor Shah Jahan!
What has he got to do with all this?
Lot of things!
Oppression!
Conversions! Discrimination!
This is the time to rewrite history.
Oh! Is that so?
But some of them
were good people, right?
Akbar, Bahadur, Shah Rukh...
Who? Shah Rukh Khan?
Wasn't he a king?
Learn history properly first.
How can you? You claim that there's
no history before the Mughals!
What do us poor people gain
by knowing all this, Son?
Anyway, who are these dead kings to us?
We're just trying to survive
without losing our lives,
from one drought to the next flood.
[Footsteps on the roof]
Ibru!
[Thud on door]
[Louder thud]
[Louder thud]
[Door being axed]
Don't come in!
I have a gun in my hand!
I said, don't come in!
Do you now understand,
on whose side Allah is?
[Gunshot]
Kill him!
Kill him!
Shoot!
Pull the trigger!
Come on!
-Ibru!
-No!
Go away!
-Ibru, listen to me at least now.
-Just go!
You can end all this right away.
Send that boy out.
Get lost!
-Ibru!
-Open! It's me!
Ibru!!
God had left him hanging in front of us!
Shucks!
You wish you had a knife
to kill him, don't you?
Anyone can pull the trigger
or wield a knife.
Only a few can kill the right
people at the right time.
Like Arjuna during
the Dharma-Yuddha (righteous war).
Dharma-Yuddha?
Yes.
What's happening now is a war, isn't it?
All over the world.
A never-ending war!
That alone is true.
Ever since humans started
walking on two feet,
there's only one thing
that they never stopped doing.
Fight with each other,
and kill each other.
So you're saying
that all this is without a reason?
Yes! There is always a reason!
What?
Hate!
Man always needs something to hate.
To maintain that hatred between us,
there will always be...
'Them'
...and 'Us'.
A spark of hate is all you need.
To ignite a raging fire...
As the fire rages...
we keep hating...
to make sure it never dies.
In the end,
we fool ourselves
into believing we've won...
And burn to death in the very same fire!
Ibrahim!
I'll give you ten minutes!
Send him out!
Otherwise I'll burn all of you alive!
Don't make me do that to this house.
We have a gun, right?
And there are just two of them!
Why don't we kill them?
'We'? Who's this 'we'?
Give that gun to me.
Send me out.
I will die if I have to.
But I'll die only after killing
at least one of them.
You idiot!
That's what they also want.
When you're at his knife's edge,
you won't be bragging so much
through your little mouth!
[Humming a tune]
What's this?
Power failure?
-Isn't anyone here?
-Preman!
Huh?
Kammu?
What are you doing here?
There was a power failure.
I came to repair it.
Okay.
Did Suma come here?
No. Why?
She's not at home.
Said she will bring dinner...
Who's this?
He's a friend of mine.
He just tagged along when I came here.
Okay then.
-Bye.
-Don't go, Preman!
She must be back home by now.
I'm heading off.
-Wait.
-You guys carry on.
Let me tell you...
That's okay.
Wait, man!
Who's that?
That's Suma's brother.
Preman.
He dropped his phone.
So he won't be able to bring
people immediately.
But the plantation workers
will start arriving in some time.
[Wasps buzzing]
[Knock on door]
-Open the door!
-Preman.
Ibru!
Open the door!
Rasool!
-What happened?
-What is this?
Why are you all locked up,
sitting in the dark?
-Did they see you?
-Who?
Kammu and that other guy with him?
They have left.
They ran away. I climbed up the tree...
...and kicked that wasp nest down.
What is it?
What happened to your hand?
Who is he?
What is this?
What happened here?
What is going on here?
Your...
What's that on your leg?
Huh?
I think...
it's a snake bite.
It's turning blue.
Poison has got in.
Take him to a hospital.
Go, Ibru. Take Preman to a hospital
as soon as you can.
Leave before they come back.
How do we get to the hospital
without a vehicle at this hour?
If we go by foot, it will be sunrise
by the time we reach Kenachal.
-That much time...
-There's a vehicle.
The key of their bike.
When that son of a bitch was hanging from
the roof, it fell down from his pocket.
Oh!
He gave it because
it's for one of his people!
Otherwise, he'd have kept it hidden.
Take it, Ibru.
Take Preman with you.
Go to a hospital.
Go, Ibru!
Rasool...
You take Preman with you.
I'll walk with him to Kenachal.
After dropping him at the police station,
I'll come to the hospital.
I'm not going anywhere.
Let them take him
when they come back.
That's better.
Ibru...
Take Preman with you.
Listen to me!
Let this boy leave from here.
It's safer for him too to leave
before they come back.
Let him escape!
So you mean,
even if all of us get killed,
you just want him to escape.
Is that right?
Who gave you the right to decide
that he shouldn't escape, Rasool?
Who gave you the authority to punish him?
After all, what was his mistake?
One morning, when we see that
our entire temple has been desecrated,
should we stay silent?
The temple he grew up around.
That too, the temple where
his grandfather was the priest.
Now tell me! Just because
he accidentally killed someone,
should you all gang up and butcher him?
How do you know all this?
I know! I know everything!
When he was petrified
and was in hiding for three days,
I was the one who gave him food
every day, so that he wouldn't die!
If they can do so much for one among you,
can't I do this for one among us?
What do you say now?
When I used to say that you
shouldn't let her into this house,
I was the bad apple for you all.
-Are y'all happy now?
-Can you please stop this?
All of you!
Aren't we...
...the same old
ourselves even now?
I'll ride the bike.
Suma, give me the key.
Give it to me!
Are you coming?
We need to talk!
K... Kammu?
Even when I kept on holding back...
-Hey!
-Leave me!
We also want to live here!
-Kammu!
-Let go of me!
Even our children have to
grow up here, without fear.
Kareem!
Brother...
Kammu...
-Brother...
No, Ibru.
No!
I've loved you all my life.
I even told you that I love you.
But you've only obeyed
what your religion says!
All this while, there was something
you kept forgetting, Ibru.
Religion and faith are not
exclusive to your people!
We too have them!
Vishnu, you ride the bike!
Preman!
Come.
The three of us will leave.
I said, come!
Haven't you had enough?
Haven't you all had enough?
Vishnu, go!
Vishnu!
Go fast!
Just go!
Go!
Vishnu!
Faster!
Kammu! Kammu!
Where's your phone?
Kammu!
Your phone?
Hey! Let's call someone.
Where's your phone?
-Kammu!
-Ibru!
Killing him off will be better than this.
Laiq!
It wasn't him.
It was her.
Suma!
Have you understood now,
when it came to choosing
between them and us,
she didn't hesitate like you.
For everything you did today,
God will punish you.
But the score that
I need to settle...
I'll make sure I
settle before I die.
Tell me.
Where did they go?
-Tell me!
-To Kenachal!
I know the way.
If you take that route,
you won't reach before them.
That's for sure.
There's a shortcut
through the forest.
Only I know that.
Why should I believe
you after all this?
Suma...
You shouldn't hurt
Suma and Preman.
You can take that boy!
You should give me your word!
You still haven't learned
anything from all this, have you?
Can you drive?
No.
I can't drive with this hand.
If one of us is holding the steering,
you just have to slip away
from the other one, right?
I will drive.
Keep quiet, Dad!
I kept quiet all this while,
and all of you did
what was done.
I'll take it from here.
If you need someone to drive a Jeep,
through unknown roads
in the forest at night,
you should be talking to me.
To Moosa Khader!
"Marching forward"
"Marching to battle"
"Unaware of the enemy,
unaware of the fate of our lives"
"A raging flame"
-Let's go.
"Marching forward to battle"
"Unaware of the enemy,
unaware of the fate of our lives"
"A raging flame"
"A flame kindled
by a primal animal instinct"
"Who is burning in it?"
"Who is burning in it?"
"Am I the prey?"
"Are you the prey?"
"Me or you?"
"You or me?"
"Am I the prey?"
"Are you the prey?"
"Me or you?"
"You or me?"
"Remember the story of these
battles and battle cries,"
"flowing as rivers of blood,
since forever"
"Lives are being lost
unnecessarily on this earth"
"Burning in this
fire of endless rage"
"O fire!"
"O fire that burns in the hull of rage"
"Who knows where all you will spread"
"As you continue to burn"
"O burning heart of ember,
this is all futile"
"There are only tears and ashes here,
after this holy sacrifice"
"Vengeance is fuming,
death is humming"
"Darkness is spreading all over,
from the long dead primitive world"
"Am I the prey?"
"Are you the prey?"
"Me or you?"
"You or me?"
"Am I the prey?"
"Are you the prey?"
"Me or you?"
"You or me?"
Stop.
If you climb this hill,
you can see the road
to the next foothill.
If you look from there...
We'll know if they are behind
or ahead of us.
Right?
If I die today,
I want to be buried near my daughter.
Once you die, wherever you lie
and rot, it's all the same.
It won't make any difference!
Are you in doubt?
What?
Are you in doubt whether what
you're doing today is right?
It is that doubt which
turns us into slaves.
When the world around us...
starts to determine rights
and wrongs by itself,
the mind starts doubting itself.
Before the Almighty Allah,
...each one of us
will stand alone, son.
The rights and wrongs that your
father and brother assert,
...won't be there in His ledger.
I too had...
...a father who taught
me only the right things.
When my organisation was banned,
the poor man got scared.
He forced me to go abroad.
And there?
Out of the frying
pan, into the fire.
Yet, I put up with everything...
...and lived my life,
without reacting to anything.
Finally, when they
got an opportunity,
they segregated us by our skin colour
and the prayer bump on our foreheads.
They isolated us.
But they can only ban organisations.
They cannot destroy ideologies!
But what happened to my father?
That innocent devout man,
who lived in fear of everything...
Didn't they kill him?
It's not my father...
...but I, who am right.
You are right.
What we're doing today is right.
They are behind us.
They will take that
turn and approach us.
With this time waiting to kill someone,
can't you save your friend's life?
Instead of standing
guard for an infidel,
if you had stood
with your brothers,
you too could have saved a life.
Get down!
If I'm going to
die, I'll die alone.
Start the vehicle!
Start the vehicle!
Get down, I say!
Run over him!
You!!!
Ibru, 'Dump the Genie'!!
Huh?
'Dump the Genie', damn it!
Dad...
Dad!
That house was built
by my father Khader.
If someone barges in there
and messes around,
whoever they are, I'll make
sure I escort them to hell!
Hey!
Hey!
Rasool?
What are you doing?
What you couldn't do!
Say thanks to God, Ibrahim.
For sparing at least one who hasn't
abandoned his faith, in your family.
Wasn't it for her?
Wasn't it to live your life
with this bloody infidel,
that you set out tonight?
Go ahead!
The authority to punish you for that...
...is not mine!
But for the all sins
you committed tonight,
a chance to atone for them,
I can give you that.
You...
...should...
...kill him, right here, right now!
Then...
Only then...
will I spare her life.
No!
Don't do it, Ibru.
Yes.
'Don't do it, Ibru'
Because, when I slit
her throat and kill her,
I want both you and
him to watch it!
No!
No!
It's easy, Ibrahim!
Easier than beheading a sacrificial lamb,
after reciting the final prayer.
I swear!
I know it!
Go! Run!
Instead of his throat,
when you jabbed
that knife into my gut,
what difference
did it make to you?
I seek forgiveness in God
I seek forgiveness in God
'I seek forgiveness in God'
'I seek forgiveness in God'
I seek forgiveness in God
I seek forgiveness in God
I seek forgiveness in God
I seek forgiveness in God
Someone who crosses the bridge
to go to the estate,
...might pass this way.
Go!
Go ahead! Escape!
If you climb down these rocks,
you'll reach the hanging bridge.
Once you cross the bridge,
do what you feel is right.
Will we all ever be
like how we used to be?
No way!
However much you two sit here,
holding on to each other,
outside your house,
beyond that bridge,
nothing will ever change.
"What I am offering are not flowers"
"Even if I offer blood...
enough to spill over a mountain"
"The raging spite only
grows stronger and stronger"
"To fight it out,
to bathe in this bloodshed"
"To pass on this spite to
the generations to come"
"Let's ignite and spread a fire"
"On and on, time and again"
"this Holy slaughter"
Do you know what's the biggest reason
for mankind's suffering?
Man's story on this earth...
...didn't begin with the forbidden fruit.
It began when Qabil,
killed his own brother,
out of spite.
That was the real 'original sin'.
It is the blood of that Qabil,
which runs through the
veins of humans.
The call of that blood...
We cannot ignore it.
Blood for blood!
Spite for spite!
Revenge for revenge!
Even if he's starving,
even if his house is leaking,
or even if he has to go to jail,
man just wants to
see the end of his enemy!
That's the power of hate.
Even if he doesn't teach
his children to read,
he will teach them whom to hate!
Generations to come,
will burn in that
raging fire of hate.
Even if man dies,
the hate within him will live on!
