Where is the money Courier,
Six minutes left?
Another piece to the rear.
A little further back.
Backwards.
Please do not do this.
I am the Courier.
- Dispose of the bag.
Are you okay?
No.
- Hang.
Do not move, I'm almost there.
- Great.
Ransom paid DAUGHTER FOR BANKS
What do you have?
- The money was delivered on time, job done.
As for the other job,
the Russian has disappeared.
What about the bag?
- Lost.
Coffee?
Fuck you, search your own home.
Note the footwork.
As they move.
See that, Lucy?
- Yes.
This is absolute perfection.
He dances.
God, you will be big.
You smell like the art class.
- Thank you, Lucy.
I bet one hundred dollars,
that the Irishman with him the next series K.O. stores.
You are about to see that Grandpa loses $ 100.
He is sloppy.
He let his hands hang too much.
There he goes.
I told you.
I have taught you too well.
That's the problem.
Lucy, we must go, or you
arrives late at school. Thank you, Dad.
See you tomorrow.
- Day baby.
How are you?
- Well, nice to see you again.
Let's cut to connect, Lucy is right.
That smell of glue makes me mad.
One evening he had a match
High stakes and went K.O.
And then I asked him:
How do you manage to be sustained?
He said to me:
the mystery of pain ...
that it is always in one place can feel.
And everything you need to know is,
where to feel it.
So ...
but once you get the deal.
- What?
Alone.
It would not hurt you ...
to go outside and see that
there is more in life.
I can help you with that, really.
You would be amazed.
I'm good with the females.
Hey, you should not come in here.
They say you're the best.
That everyone can find.
You ask no questions.
You not choose sides.
It does not interest you what you deliver.
And therefore, I was asked ...
this job to offer.
$ 100,000 to deliver this suitcase.
And if I say no?
You have two and a half days
to the suitcase to be delivered.
Fuck you.
If you deliver him,
you get the money and you see us ever again.
But if you reject my offer ...
- God.
Or, you're not on time ...
then, as you see,
You're not the only one we can find.
To whom do I submit it?
- A man named Evil Sivle.
Where is he?
- If I knew, I was not here.
This is $ 10,000.
I hope that your costs.
The rest you get when you deliver the suitcase.
You have now started 60 hours.
The time is ticking.
No trace of the Russians or the trunk.
Who has it, is dead.
On the other hand, Steele
Lake Charles has the problem solved ...
and he is on his way to St. Louis.
- Keep me informed.
Tell her we go;
because it is closer to the toy stores ...
I want her there and back to increase
Hang in there.
If there is not a destination,
why must there something coming?
They want to score just find.
- Then I find him.
And I think those other two bastards too.
Stitch, I'll arrange it.
What do you know about this Sivle Evil?
- Not much good.
He has done business with Maxwell.
Something of contract killers. Extremely brutal.
Nobody has ever seen him,
but everyone knows his name.
And long before Katrina
they all disappeared.
Disappeared? What happened?
- No one knows.
But this is New Orleans.
Set one no questions.
Collection agency ACQUITTED
- Who is this man?
That was Maxwell's auditor.
If you want to find someone from that team,
you start with him.
At one point, the FBI discovered
you in their database hacked.
They have not caught me so far
and that they are not going to do.
Uncle Eddie.
I believe my eyes.
The last time I saw you you were
but a high peat ...
and put you to mess in the case
from your father. How is he?
Well, come inside.
What are you doing in New Orleans?
What do you need today?
We all have good things
on route 90 of the truck fall.
I needed something light
not be traced.
How about that courier? Are you promoted?
I did not know you wear a gun.
We have what you need.
Walther 380 ACP.
Those crashes. I can not trust her.
- Name a woman who can trust?
Colt 38. A short walk.
- Fixed shot.
This is the Ford of pistols.
I want a Cadillac.
We have a .44 Magnum, 3-inch.
This is the V8 '67 Cadillac of guns.
May I ask what?
What do you know about a guy
Sivle called Evil?
Since you want nothing to do with it.
- Is that so?
I've seen him ten years ago.
Death came and lay his
finger on New Orleans.
And that finger belonged to, Evil Sivle.
- So there you are looking for.
Then you have some better weapons.
And why?
- Because the man is dead.
He is risen from the dead.
It is said that voodoo him
to life.
Because the left hand of death
death can not go.
So that you do not mind chasing,
not at all.
Listen,
I take the Caddy and the HK.
The best weapon ever built
the Magnum 350.
Do you still need something else, Courier?
Actually, I should as soon as possible
to St. Louis.
We can help you so bad.
- I thought so
One hour.
- This is the key to the gate.
But you must bring your own pilot.
That was it,
always nice to do business with you.
Stitch.
- Got it?
No. Call Jimmy for me.
- Have you been traveling?
Yes, I'm half a mile west
Bayou Teche, north of 83.
I'll arrange it for you.
- Yes, right now. Thank you.
Eddie sent me.
He said you needed a pilot.
Stitch.
- I think they made it.
Yes, she is here. What happened to Jimmy?
- He is working on something.
You could ask me that.
I stand in front of you.
How long.
- Since her fifth.
I know him from my fourth.
- Since your fifth.
I have chosen her for a good reason.
- Why?
I did recoveries with my father.
She steals all cars before they could ride.
She has been through a lot. Her mother
left her, went back to China ...
her father landed in jail.
I practically raised her,
while he was stuck.
It's actually Deidre's little sister.
She is strong, smart and fearless.
Do you think I would send someone
that the job could not.
And apart from that, I thought you
in one way or the other would come together.
You both need someone.
- No surprises.
You are incredible.
I'm glad you think so.
- You really think you're a charmer, or not?
Refreshing, no?
Tell me,
Why you'll work with Stitch?
I need the money.
And that none of your business.
Well, actually ...
that is my business.
Wait a minute, I have not agreed
something to steal.
We're going to steal anything.
We borrow it only briefly.
Okay, and your friend has the keys
certainly lost?
Something like that.
Want to go?
You know this is going to cost you extra?
- That is already the case.
So, what exactly is your job?
I deliver things.
What's in it?
- Do you always ask so many questions?
Questions go along with the pilot.
Nothing you say will cost three times as much.
I never ask what's inside.
- Why not?
That's why people hire me.
I ask no questions, I'll supply alone.
I think you're involved in it.
You think you do not, but ...
I think you should concentrate more
on your driving style.
If I can fly and talk
I can drive and talk.
Okay, wait a minute.
We go right here.
See that black car?
Remain two car lengths behind.
Look at his flashers,
use but not yours.
If he returns, wait five seconds.
Then once you do, you do everything he does.
Is this a standard delivery procedure?
- It is making progress.
Calm down.
Turn the car off.
Wait here.
Wait a minute. Calm down.
I have a few questions.
It is not safe here.
- What is not safe?
He's back.
He will take vengeance on us all.
Let me go, please.
- Where Evil Sivle?
Nobody likes Evil Sivle.
He will find you.
And if he finds you, he is the last
what you will ever see.
Why is he back?
Retribution. Evil takes back
what was taken from him.
Why am I doing this?
What?
- Sem Frantanna is dead
The old data is destroyed.
Steele is also dead.
What happened?
- We do not know exactly.
It's your job to know.
- Yes, sir.
In three days I take back what is mine.
Everything must be settled.
Take Steele his job and check for the case.
- Yes, sir.
Stanton, come here.
Sit down, boy.
I have something for you.
I'm only two days birthday.
- I can not wait.
Wait, let me.
Sit down.
Connection is there.
Have you ever thought that the time
for another job?
That did not hurt.
Keep pressure on the wound.
I can not really place your accent?
Where are you from?
A little bit of everywhere.
- Has 'everywhere' in a name?
I was born in China.
But then, just everywhere.
Why did you come back?
Because the life
a very nasty humor.
What?
You perfume.
- Lily of the valley.
Do you not like?
No, I think it's good.
It's just ...
What is it?
Thank you.
For more, you warned me.
How does she do it?
- She talks too much.
Whatever.
Thank you.
Do you want coffee?
- I gotta go. Walk with me here.
How's Deidre?
- What do you think?
I saw her and Lucy in a safe place
housed, but have not told why.
And that's difficult if they do not know why.
But what can you do.
You have done well.
Want to talk about what you do not tell me?
What do you know about this man?
- Jack Straw, 'n petty criminal ...
you can find it somewhere
St. Ann and Dauphine.
Thank you.
Keep an eye on her.
It was a tough day yesterday.
Do not move.
- I did not say anything, I did nothing, man.
Do not do this, man, please.
Get in the car.
You're out of the car, now.
Are you going to murder me?
If I wanted to finish, then I
already done so.
So shut up. I'm looking and I know Evil Sivle
that he will need. So where is he?
I do not know. I swear.
I know nothing of him, I do not even know him.
And why you're the last living
on this hit list?
Is it now back at you?
We will do so. If you lie to me or
the grind does not mention or something ...
I shoot a bullet in your leg
and I throw you out of the car ...
and let me show you where you fall behind,
you understand what I say.
What do you know?
- The auditor talked about retaliation.
What did he mean?
- I do not know.
What did he mean?
No, man.
Listen, I just know that ...
that anyone who ten years ago
with him had to do ...
dusty reunion get when you understand me.
- What happened 10 years ago?
Who are you?
I am the one who keeps you alive.
So answer the question.
Ten years ago
all hell broke loose in New Orleans.
And Evil Sivle was the reason.
He was the ongoing death.
Even God trembled as he heard his name.
- And Maxwell, who was trembling too?
Is that why Evil disappeared?
- Maxwell loved him like a son.
Until they murdered his wife and child.
Cut them into pieces and sent them by post.
Nobody knows what happened afterwards.
Some say that Evil, Maxwell murdered ...
Some say that Maxwell had murdered Evil,
Some say that everyone was killed that day.
If everyone would die
why do you stand on that list?
Because I ask too many questions.
 Office of Mayor Shirer. </ i>
Can you explain me,
why these people are dead?
And I found this in the car,
you have stolen.
How is it that every place that you
there seem to leave behind?
I have nothing to say, detective.
There is a call for you.
Sit down.
How do you fuck off?
- I had to urgently go to the toilet.
You probably have friends everywhere, right?
You're free to go.
I got a phone from the sergeant,
which was called by the Lieutenant ...
who was called by the mayor,
which was called by a friend of yours.
Who is this friend of mine?
Have a nice day, gentlemen.
I have a package for you.
- Are you kidding me?
What, no.
Who is the sender?
- I do not know.
I got a call to deliver it.
They described how you looked.
 STOP OR YOU ARE NOT FIND THE NEXT </ i>
Stitch, where are you?
Call me back immediately.
Hello?
 Hello </ i>
- How you doing, Eddie?
Who is this?
- How is your family?
 Your granddaughter is growing up so fast. </ i>
- Do I know you sometimes?
 Why does your friend to Sivle Evil </ i>
I do not know who you are and what you want.
And I have no idea what is going on.
 FUNDS USED IN riverboat gambling
Shared scams </ i>
Welcome home.
You set me up.
You got me with money paid
what the NOPD introduced as evidence?
You get me out of jail,
with a murder indictment.
You listen to my apartment.
Did you really think you would not I like?
That I would find out that you're from the FBI?
Why are you talking about a murder indictment?
You have broken the rules
and you got my goddaughter involved.
You go to hell.
It was not me that you have removed.
Think about it,
even if I could legally regulate ...
would cost me weeks of paperwork.
Services and friends that I have not.
And this here is two generations newer
than what we budget.
Sivle Evil is dead.
Really? Why do I have a briefcase
Russian couriers in possession of a ...
he him within three days
to deliver?
And why the corpses pile up,
where his name attached to it?
I am four years looking for Evil Sivle.
And then you come one day closer to him,
that I've ever been.
But now we have him.
Because we have something he wants.
And what is that?
You.
I deliver packages off.
I hunt not after spirits.
It seems that mind you now hunts.
He wants you for some reason on the street
and you come only from ...
if we find him before he finds you.
This case is perhaps the only
that you are still alive.
Maybe so.
Leaving does not mean it is over.
- Well.
Hello.
- I hate it when I be hanged.
I have already told you that I really know nothing.
Who's your friend with the suitcase, Eddie?
Eddie ...
Stitch, no.
It's all good.
We see each other again soon.
THIS WILL KEEP HER IN LIFE
It's me, Anna.
I can not find Eddie.
We have almost no time.
How far are we?
The old man did not know much
and did not last long.
So the courier will be motivated.
There is also a girl with him.
Who is she?
- She has something to do with the old man.
Let the girl disappear
that will motivate him more.
Listen, if we miss the deadline
I want you take this guy.
Where to?
- Far away.
For how long?
- Until I appear again, you know?
I see.
- Dad?
When we go home?
- Fast enough.
Where'd you get that?
That is ...
This is an old roller coaster.
Let me guess.
Running into a burning building
to save a helpless girl.
That's really long ago.
That gas under my apartment
has exploded.
I can not really remember.
You're lucky you're alive.
Is that so?
Stitch has found me.
He has helped me back on the road.
If there is such thing as luck, it was him.
What is happening?
We only have 30 seconds, hurry up.
- Who are they?
Road now.
- They will murder you.
Hurry up.
- Yes.
We go through that door.
Here the stairs.
Hurry up.
Why is this happening?
It was not about him, right?
We are just in the way.
Why did you take?
Why have not you given him?
Stop and talk with me.
They have seen your face
and they know who you are.
Do not you understand?
I can no longer protect.
You must stay here.
Where do you think you're doing?
I had vowed never to do.
Do you?
We lost him.
Who is this guy?
What we know is that the old man
found him ...
after he was almost beaten to death
and was left for dead.
More he did not know. But do not worry,
his need for revenge is too strong ...
for him to be careful.
He will soon show.
Where's the Russian?
- Still missing.
Okay, I need to know what my weakness is,
for it is too late
Dad?
- Not now, Stanton, I'm busy.
I got three days to damn suitcase
Evil Sivle to give.
They would murder me,
if I would be on time.
But Evil Sivle, the last face
you'll ever see.
I am as good as dead,
if you're not doing anything.
I want you to go back
and we will protect you.
Would you use me as bait?
What are you doing here, Anna?
Do I know you from somewhere?
- No, but I know you did.
I thought that with this nonsense stopped.
That's a difficult choice,
1000 you can make good ...
but a wrong and you've had it.
Have you lost the keys?
For your Evil Sivle can find you
behind his past days.
Maxwell has him on his thirteenth home
taken, he loved him as a son ...
and has taught him everything.
- How do you know all?
Because I have eyes and ears on the street was.
I kept him well informed.
And why is it paradise lost?
- By a woman. Evil fell in love.
But she wanted him to have quitted.
Especially when she got pregnant.
Evil when his son saw everything has changed.
He tried to get out, but Maxwell
saw as the ultimate betrayal.
So let Evil Maxwell's family murder,
but he made a mistake.
He killed not Evil
Evil and went crazy.
He killed everyone from top to bottom.
But you've already
thinking about choices, right?
That you already have in mind
since you first met them.
Is not that so?
But I can help you with that choice.
I offer you the chance to, once
and always with this life to stop.
You are in grave danger.
Both of you.
You just need to keep in touch ...
and tells me what he thinks and where he is.
If you help me, I promise you
tomorrow you your life back ...
free.
Fuck you.
What can happen in three days?
- He'll finish what he started.
He kills anyone who betrayed him.
Me too and he has rented in the Capo's.
And I hear those bastards,
know how to get them to make.
Quiet.
I'm sorry, really sorry.
Is it?
- Yes.
Go ahead, we must find the Capo's.
Have you received?
Why are you doing this?
You get it therefore not return.
No, but it makes it okay.
- How, by losing everything?
Pick up the phone.
AGENT LISPY
It is not the real case.
There is a transmitter.
Do we need him?
Press Play.
 We have the suitcase. </ i>
- Who is he working?
 We do not know. </ i>
Vegas.
- What happened in Vegas?
Let's go.
If he wants to play, we play it.
- We have the silver polish ...
Sounds like we have guests tonight.
- We go home and make fun.
With a garlic press?
- That I love.
He has taken the bait, with lead and al
- Good.
Stanton, play something else, you know
I hate that song.
I want a taxi to the 'Lucky 7'.
Yes, right now.
In Laurel, Mississippi?
If I'm not back tomorrow,
pick up my car and go to that address.
There is also the family of Stitch around.
- What?
I do not know what will happen.
But I'm looking at you when it's over.
No.
- That is the safest place for you, Anna.
Why are you doing this?
Keep on with it.
He is not there anymore.
Here you go.
You have the address.
You can not stay here.
You're really persistent.
- Give me your location and ...
I'll get you both out.
- Yes?
How?
- I'll take.
Where are you now?
- In Las Vegas.
The Lucky 7.
- Where is he going?
Names, addresses, whatever?
- He has a book, I can see.
Imagine not disappoint us,
they are very dangerous people.
He's in the FBI.
He said that he can help.
Do not you understand?
It's a win-win situation.
A chance.
To start over.
Somewhere far away.
Do we not both?
Hold on.
There he is.
- Welcome back.
So you want to find Sivle Evil.
- We bring you with him.
But you must promise to do something for us.
If you encounter him in hell,
you must give him the greetings.
It was for that briefcase
when in New Orleans.
Did you know that until the second century, torture
was used almost exclusively by slaves?
It was thought ...
that a slave only spoke the truth,
if one of them pulled with violence.
But by the time tortures were
applied to everyone.
It was a means for the good
the earth of evil to save.
My wife is what romantic
I have more practical, is it not?
Yes.
I think you will find the gate
to the concept, by pain ...
and we have that port.
Go ahead.
Five seconds.
Ten seconds.
That's your death reflex that on.
The burn is caused by the adrenaline
that is released and increased heart rate.
Your mind thinks you drown,
that death takes over.
But that's your mind
you fooling.
The pain makes the mind clear,
a clouded mind lying.
The problem of torture ...
that the thugs just said, what
they thought the good guys wanted to hear ...
So as all other things, had
torturing change, evolve.
And you know what we found?
The good must do it this way ...
that the wicked do not want it to end.
Make it so the pain just as you want
if I should give you.
And you know how we do it?
We search together for truth.
Did you know that in the fingertips
millions of nerve endings are ...
nociceptors that called?
A kind of fast connection to the brains.
You can ask me anything you want,
and I will answer all questions ...
but each question will cost you
a considerable amount of pain.
The more pain you feel,
the more honest your questions will be.
The sooner we hear the truth.
Ready?
You might as well die with that knowledge ...
- A question?
because without that knowledge die
is the real torture.
A question, please?
Where is Evil Sivle?
- Evil Sivle is dead.
At this time transmits the high-speed connection
a message to your brains ...
order to find a reason.
But as we have seen ...
lie the brains.
The next question.
That's not a question.
Okay, as Evil dead,
Who is behind this?
That question is much better.
Technically, Evil is only an idea.
Something that scares everyone
when they hear that name.
Therefore, Maxwell used his name.
We go by.
You'll stay with us.
Your body just learned that the only means
against the pain, honesty.
The next question.
Listen, if you ask no questions;
we must ask questions ...
and that does a lot more pain.
- Like, who hired you?
Would you say ...
Maxwell, Evil?
Of course, who else had
that all can do?
Damn, I think he faints.
You have done well.
You did much better than your friend Stitch.
We try again later.
If you're feeling better.
You just rest a while.
I'm going to eat I start the oven ...
The place where you can find it,
in your past. Sivle Who is Evil?
Nobody has ever seen him.
- Why is he back?
We come together behind the truth.
- You perfume?
It's Lily of the valley, not good?
- I can not remember.
Evil has fallen, had a son.
Everything has changed.
Sivle Who is Evil?
- He went to Maxwell.
Sivle Evil is dead.
- Voodoo has brought him back to life.
How he came back from the dead?
- Can you tell me your name?
I do not remember.
- He will finish what he began.
Your name.
- Who are you?
There must be some thyme.
It is not quite right.
What can I do in there ...
Whatever you want, honey.
- I have no more lemon.
Only salt is good I think.
The food is delicious.
I do not know, honey,
maybe a little ...
Where is Maxwell?
Where is he?
In Pradis Casino, you fucking asshole.
Maxwell?
- What?
The Capo's death.
Where is the boy?
- Outside the city.
Who is this?
Who is this?
- Not who you expect.
You live so still.
I think we all do
we or someone else, right?
Look at my face.
Is this the face of the man
I once was?
This is the face of a broken heart.
You still do not understand, huh?
I've always wondered what
happened to your body.
So I hired a Russian courier.
I had to know.
If you're looking for death,
then you find that a time, right?
I've given my life.
I've given you my heart ...
and that you have betrayed.
If a man makes such choices ...
he must live with the consequences, right?
Do you think we here without Julia
still would have been?
You can change everything ...
but not the eyes.
Certainly not yours.
You can you
really do not remember, right?
You were nothing more than a rascal
when I got out of the gutter.
I've learned everything you know.
We were together to build an empire.
Did you really think I
by Julia would be allowed to degrade?
Evil has fallen in love with Julia.
But she made him stop.
When his son saw Evil, everything changed.
He wanted to leave Maxwell.
But Maxwell saw as the ultimate betrayal.
So he killed Julia and his son.
Evil was crazy and killed everyone.
All of them.
Then nobody has ever
something heard of them.
Some say that Maxwell
Evil murder ...
but others say that Evil Maxwell
killed and then disappeared.
And everything changed.
But ultimately there is really
none of us changed, huh?
What we do ...
we can never stain
wegpoetsen on our soul.
Even if you deny it, you know that
your family is dead because of you.
If not, Evil?
No.
Do you know this yet?
This was once the Cadillac of guns.
Listen, I'm going home.
But that's not the same
if you're not there.
What do you think? For the good old days?
- Go to hell.
You really want to do?
Do it fast.
I've now twice
the world offered.
And every time you break my heart.
My mistake was ...
I feel when Julia had to bury.
Yes, that's my boy.
He's back.
If you pull the trigger, you will
never know where your son is.
My son?
- Come on, man.
You did not think I would murder him?
I love that boy.
Where is my son?
- He is like you, he has that anger.
He has that coolness.
That is absolutely perfect binding.
I think he got
when he saw his mother die.
You never know where your son is.
