So who is the N ä chste?

I was last year already with you. 
Frenchy. Are you sick

No, I have a carbuncle. 
This costs

- This is just enough. 
Come clean. 
- You now have a helper? 
- Quite right. 
Pull your pants down once already. 
This is Frenchy Plante.

Then we patch up our patients.

- Says The driver, a real lady. 
Mr. Flaunce, you know what they do. 
K ö nnten you are looking for the woman. 
- Yes, well. 
- And others are looking for the bandits. 
Come not, Doctor? 
No. The coachman needs me 
and other patients. 
Want to ride with us? 
I have no horse. 
Take mine. 
You trust me? 
And if I did not come back? 
No matter where you go,

Which party do you ride? 
- Find The Lost Lady. 
- I thought so. 
Take good care of that, my property

Do not worry, I adjust to the fact 
and also on the horse. 
There's something! 
She is not in here. 
But there is a bag. 
Yes, the bag seems to her to go ren ö 
You ß t hei Elizabeth Mahler, comes from

- I ß wei, that was a thorn bush. 
- Are you long for Dr. Frail? 
- Not very long. 
Then, you use. 
Thank you. 
I know the doctor about 5 years. 
We then searched for gold.

But he can not

- Maybe he has his soul in it. 
- If he has a soul. 
I've even asked the Doc, 
where his name herstammt. Frail. 
He said ...

from Norwegian. 
Du wei ß t 
It is not his real name.

He challenges force of death. 
The other day he's going to one,

A miracle that he did

Why would he kill him?

He lived in a city 
where the Ohio into the Mississippi flowing ß t. 
He is there a sch ö nes House

And one night 
something happened in that house. 
A man and a woman ... 
... there should have perished. 
And the doctor should

Can still be the charred 
Walls dividing the pastures to see. 
- Have you seen it? 
- I think a rattlesnake. 
Schie ß t you like to snakes?

It is more dead than alive. 
There is not much

But what is still there,

This ought to

There's nothing to it. 
Come on, we put them on a stretcher

In the gorge. 
I! She's alive! 
I've found the woman doctor. 
M ssen ü once you come too. 
I have a patient here. 
What makes the Red Anna with you? 
She is waiting for death. 
She did not die down there. 
- The Lady sees it from ö b se. 
- I'm coming as fast as I can. 
- F Anna ü r k ö you can do anything. 
- No, that has probably never done one. 
But I'll leave it alone. 
- How long will it take? 
- 2 hours, I think. 
Should I turn around her neck, 
make it faster? 
No, doctor, no. 
I say nothing. 
I have done my duty,

That's my water bottle, doctor.

She has severe burns 
and Gehirnersch ü tterung. 
Perhaps internal injuries. 
It is probably blind. 
- You will never see again can k ö? 
- I can not say yet. 
It was probably the whole day 
unconscious in the sun. 
- First, they need time to get out. 
- We ask the trapper to the car. 
We still have a small house, 
against ü ber of baby's. 
Then k ö nnten bring them. 
N Sch ö, I'll get the car. 
Do you have enough water, Doctor? 
Yes. Put it beside the stove, 
We ü m ssen it boil. 
And you, do that, you get out. 
Doctor, you will not have time,

When I had finished the housework

Hey, boy!

He has to wash them, yes.

You've found it! 
It should be migrated quite fresh. 
Wom ö so resembled a loose woman. 
What does this have to do with it? It is 
a stranger here, blind, and severely wounded. 
Dr. Frail? My husband has given you 
rashly offered to our house. 
- You will not die here. 
- You will not die. 
They will live, Ms. Mahler. 
It'll get better.

Here in the area is no one

Good morning, Rune. 
Where did you get the horse from? 
The doctor took it in payment. 
He l ä sst ask

I have saved you, ck 3 St ü. 
How is our beauty Sch ö? 
She now sits on the 1.Mal,

- Still blind? 
- The doc says it may take yet. 
Very fresh eggs. 
They are rare here drau ß en. 
- We f dr cken ü ü r Lady thumb.

That makes $ 3, pay at the checkout. 
Is not that a bit steep,

It was a b ö ser winter. 
My mother died this year. 
My father said: 
''Come, let us emigrate. 
In a country 
which offers us a new future.'' 
Oh, it was wonderful. 
The train to St. Louis. 
Then the river steamer 
the Missouri River and up. 
And then the coach ü about the mountains

A wonderful country 
just as in our ä umen Tr. 
''And now,''said my father, 
''Elizabeth, now we ü m ssen 
Find the right place''. 
Did you think 
Here w ä re the right place? 
If I can see again,

What you will see is a small

It sweeps away the first Windsto ß,

Tell me, what is Rune? 
And you, Doctor Frail? 
How do you like? 
Rune? The slightly cross-eyed

And the doctor has 
a gray beard and no teeth Z ä. 
I further ß that is not true. 
Rune is certainly a Bscher h ü boy. 
By Dr. Frail I can

I only know of his H ä nde. 
They are tanned by the sun

And terribly long legs he has. 
He's coming in 3 steps to a T ü r.

No, until she is healthy,

Rune? Is anyone there? 
Only the good old Frenchy, 
to make his respects. 
I was the one you drau ß s

I wanted to ask if I

Excuse me,

But nat ü rlich, Ms. Mahler.

In quantities as

Who helps me to Ausr ü pation, 
which nothing else can happen. 
- Ausr ü pation? So you need money?

I am sorry to you uschen entt ä. 
My father had all our money.

- Yes, yes. 
Yes. He has now. 
- I think I'd better go. 
- Good night, Mr. Plante. 
- Is everything all right, Elizabeth?

K ö can you see anything? 
No. 
Now go with the lamp out and ü ck. 
Nothing. 
That's not entirely true, Elizabeth. 
Their eyes follow the light. 
- Tell me what you see. 
- Please, try it. 
- I see some light as if through fog. 
- Something light? That's a lot. 
That is more

And tomorrow you will see a lot more. 
I can not see. 
But I thank you.

But if you keep them open, 
You see things as they are. 
I can not. 
I'll leave you here alone. 
You are on the brink of an abyss. 
I'll give you some advice: 
Do not go 
with eyes closed through life. 
(Rune) You can see them. 
It is free. 
Why do not you go home? 
I wait until you go. 
Take your time not be too long. 
Please, sir.

I apologize to her.

Are you afraid of me,

Then you should go.

Good morning. My name is

Thank you, all mine.

Excuse me. Thank you. 
Good day. 
Rune has told me

Glad

Thank you. 
I m ö chte one Minenausr ü pation. 
Excuse me? 
Rune and I 
want to go fossicking. 
I see. 
Fits for the f r ü a woman? 
- I'm still there.

W ü you rden me 
then a Ausr ü pation borrow? 
It is very valuable, 
one Familienerbst ü ck. 
The stones are really very rare. 
This is an exciting St ü ck. 
I have a magnifying glass in the apartment. 
Do you have any objection 
n ä me when I look at her? 
Nat ü rlich not. Please. 
- Doctor, she wants a Minenausr ü pation. 
- I thought so. 
She wants to borrow money then. 
This should be an old Erbst ü ck. 
Do you think 
That is more than $ 20 worth? 
Tell her that you are her 
umen an open credit Einr ä. 
All right, Doctor. 
If you daf ü r underwrite. 
Well? 
Your Frenchy was not lying! 
Give me the money 
and it can go to work. 
No, first 
We discuss the events ä products. 
It's embarrassing, with a lady 
Done ä ü ber fte speak. 
- Mr. Plante, we get down to business. 
- Substance. 
To the point. 
What do you think of 20%? 
Gro ß z ü giger as I can be. 
I can at any time Ausr ü pation 
get to 5 or 10%. 
Why do you do it then? 
No, 20% is too little. 
We want 50%. 
- The k ö you can accept or ... 
- Reject. 
Yes, or reject it. 
- 50%. 
- 50%. 
Because you are. 
Here's my hand on it. 
No, first we go to Mr. Flaunce 
and make the contract. 
And then we shake hands. 
Agreed? 
''... erkl ä ren to indemnify, 
that if one partner 
in the above-referenced Mine 
ckziehen from work to ü will ... '' 
Brrrrrrr! 
I catch the groove 
up there at the waterfall at 
and f ü them down hre 
behind the tree in the creek. 
I'll beat the sh ü Geb. 
Well, the proud owner of mine? 
Sit down there in the shade. 
Frenchy does everything alone. 
I will participate as you are. 
Please consider me as a man 
(laughs) 
That will not be easy. 
A better verbal ä EMPLOYMENT f ü r lts 
H ä hands will help you cause. 
Well, you are 'ne number, you know. 
They are really 'ne dolle number. 
Go up 
and f ä lle wood f ü r the gutter.

Rune! Rune! 
Go up to the water! 
So now we are ready 
to wash the sand. 
Down with the water! 
(Cheers) 
(Laughter) 
K ö Now we can begin to dig. 
Now we de rei ß Earth

10 meters of cotton fabric. 
Whoever gets the child? 
The wife of Russell. 
How I know she wants to 4 dozen 
Diapers. Since we prefer to take 12 m. 
Tell me, have Flaunce, you 
which go from the river above ö rt? 
Do you have some nostalgia? 
No, I just wanted to know 
how's ben since ü dr. 
- The mine is in operation. 
- With Success? 
Not likely. 
Only 5 ounces to 3 weeks. 
That hardly covers the interest. 
It takes time. 
It has 
f ü r ü about $ 1,000 of goods taken. 
- And I will continue to give her credit? 
- Yes. 
- Even if nothing comes out? 
- Even if I lose every penny. 
It is indeed nothing to me, Doctor. 
When Done ä ftsmann I do not understand 
how do you come to Their Costs. 
I am not an event ftsmann ä and 
therefore accountable to no one. 
Thank you

Not even my wife wei ß them. 
I promised Russell 
I watch him think. 
He was probably more scared than his wife. 
M ä Men are funny. 
How many M ä male by their wives

The k ü rzeste ü way is via the comb

MINE LUCKY LADY'''' 
OWNER: E. MAHLER, F. PLANTE, RUNE 
In about one months ü 
we have found almost nothing. 
I'm just not ü Gl ck. 
- We have ü m ssen patience. 
- Patience is something I have not. 
Good day, Doctor. I am pleased 
that you can look at times. 
I visited a patient. 
- M ö you'd like some coffee? 
- Yes, please. 
Thank you. 
Do not tell a doctor weight ö hnlich: 
''How are you? '' 
And:''You see once your tongue''? 
I see how you feel. 
Is it me good? 
- Show me nde Their H ä. 
- They're dirty. 
Maybe I should ask 
how are you? 
Come stop by on occasion. 
I'll give you what f ü r lts H ä nde. 
Thank you, Doctor. 
Lucky Lady''''. 
Have Eq ü ck? 
No, but a little bit of hope 
can not hurt. 
How is Rune? 
They are missing two of us. 
What do you want? 
Spying on us? 
What's the matter, 
what he can not see? 
Well, Rune? 
To work, Rune! 
Ren you go ö only 50% of this hole. 
I will certainly 
not more than 50% dirt digging. 
Why do not we cut the crap go? 
Do it all. But then 
ö go mine rune and my rt. 
My share k ö nnt have it cheap. 
And why ü w rde Mr. Plante 
so much money vorschie ß s, 
if he does not believe in the mine? 
Why you must ü m 
Watch a woman like that? 
If a partner is not certain rights? 
So take a look but does not hurt. 
You have to be well doctor 
in order to rfen the d ü. 
As you probably nnte k ö 
allow even more. 
You really are a tough old boot. 
But wait a minute. 
That's better than nothing. 
Rune! 
I walk into the village. 
I m ö chte that you come with me. 
K ö you can stay calm here. 
It happens you nothing. 
See you tomorrow, Frenchy. 
From today I'm going at night 
stay down in the village. 
I come here just to work. 
(Sob) 
I have the plague, eh? 
The plague. 
For a moment, 
I'll just change. 
Good evening. 
Good evening, Mrs. Flaunce. 
Our vorr ä te come to an end. 
I ask for an advance or 
my needle. 
Their Unsch ä tzbare needle! 
The sack of potatoes is not worth it. 
Excuse me, what do you think? 
I've seen lhr account register. 
The needle 
ä h tte I have borrowed a penny. 
- What do you want? 
- Do not play the innocent. 
So you know: Dr. Frail 
has advanced to you the money. 
K ö us we can well imagine 
She told him how to ckzahlen ü. 
I have it in black and white ß: 
$ 1119, you were worth it so far. 
Running up like a whore! 
L ü gnerin. Common wrong queue. 
One should trample you. 
At some point, somehow 
I pay every penny for ü ck. 
- What you pay for ü ck? 
- I was in the shop. 
Mrs. Flaunce says you made me think. 
They even called me a whore. 
That was not my intention. 
I'm sorry. 
- Better to leave the city. 
- Do not meddle in my life! 
Who gives you the right to 
playing with people's lives like that? 
Drag the people themselves 
and sto s ß them out. 
- Gef ä it llt you, len people ä qu? 
- Not at all. 
But you qu ä len us! 
Rune just like me. 
- Life is political once r ä. 
- Maybe it already has. 
Then it is true 
what one ä erz hlt. 
- From the woman who killed herself. 
- Yes, that's true. 
I was married to this woman. 
And the man was my brother. 
I have no right to forget. 
M ö you'd like me more erz hlen ä? 
This is a tincture from plants ö l. 
I have you f ü r produced. 
It will heal Their H ä nde 
gardens and at the same time surveilance ä. 
I'm at the end! I'm ready! 
I can not stand it any longer. 
But what we have found 
but must come from somewhere! 
Somewhere, yes! This is probably 
of the Flood ü brig remained. 
(Rumble, squeak) 
What is it? 
The whole earth is moving! 
Caution, the tree! 
(Elizabeth) Rune! 
- Rune! 
- Here I am. 
- This is gold! 
- What is it? 
Gold. 
The roots of the tree 
have held it. 
Where are you? 
The freeze is in Tr ü mmer gone. 
Where are you? 
What are you doing in that hole? 
Look. 
A miracle. 
Here, here. In the tree.

Come on everyone!
