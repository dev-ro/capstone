(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Ryan?
Perfect.
(DOG BARKING)
Norman, you scared me.
Did you leave that door open?
Or is your daddy home? Yeah.
(BUMP)
Ryan?
It's me!
Roman. Jesus.
I thought you were Ryan.
Here.
Do you know where Ryan is?
He's getting in on the 10:30 ferry.
Wants you to pick him up.
He called. I guess you were busy.
Got it.
Oh, baby.
What's all this?
Come on, I'll drive. Come here.
Well, just the fact
that Jim gave me the case.
I mean, there are five other guys
he could've given it to,
but he handed it to me. Hi, baby.
Miranda is insanely jealous. Yes.
What's in your pocket?
You haven't listened
to a word I've said, have you?
Yeah, five guys,
Miranda's insanely jealous.
What's in the pocket?
Open it.
It's your mother's old silver chain.
Ryan, it's beautiful.
- That's paper inside.
- Paper?
Paper for...
Our first anniversary.
Oh, my God, it's tonight.
- I don't even know what to say.
- Don't worry. You've been so busy.
No, please, don't make excuses for me.
- I will make this up to you.
- Really? You promise?
- What's on the paper?
- My love for you.
Sealed forever.
It's pretty dark out there, huh?
- Oh, my God. I love it.
- I love you.
(LOUD BANG)
You're welcome.
Thanks for telling me.
- He made me promise.
- Sneak.
You do everything
your big brother tells you?
Yeah, right. If I listened to him,
I wouldn't be such a fuckup,
and you two never would've met.
Can't fault you on that one.
All right.
- I'm gonna get out of your hair.
- RYAN: No, no, no rush.
I gotta go change anyway.
Thanks, big man.
It really looks beautiful.
I'm sorry about earlier.
Please don't smoke in the house.
Roman.
- You want one?
- No.
You know I promised Ryan.
Is that paper?
It's cute.
You know I can't save you
You're on your own
You're on your own
No, I just can't...
(MUSIC STOPS PLAYING)
Things get too busy on the couch to call?
- I was doing something for my brother.
- Oh, yeah?
Am I ever gonna meet
this brother of yours?
That's not likely.
Thornton Wilder wrote,
"There's a land of the living,
"and a land of the dead
and the bridge is love,
"the only survival, and the only meaning."
- My mom would've loved you.
- Well, of course.
You said she had good taste.
You know, you can't ever leave me,
no matter how bad a wife I am.
You're a perfect wife.
Liar.
You know,
we wanted to be pregnant by now.
I can't take that kind of time
off work right now.
Besides, we need my income.
That's not an issue. Come on.
I don't know if I'm ready.
What if we lose us?
Jess, you will never lose me.
So what was it like in prison?
Sex isn't all it's cracked up to be.
If you could start your life over.
what would you do different?
I'd be someone else.
That's sad, Roman. Anyone can change.
Change is choice, you know?
"Change is choice"?
Where'd you read that?
Just made it up.
- So, when will I see you again?
- Hard to say.
You're not gonna do anything stupid,
are you?
See? Right there.
That's what it's like being me.
Everyone always thinks
I'm up to something.
I wonder why.
You're sexy when you work.
Norman.
Hang on, hang on.
Lucky coin.
Damn it.
You know, no one ever died
from taking a day off.
- It broke. I don't know what happened.
- Oh, that's okay. I'll fix it.
- Unless you forget where you put it.
- Oh, don't you worry,
I'll find a perfectly safe place for it.
(RATTLING)
(BURPS)
We're out of juice.
(NORMAN GROWLING)
Norman. Come on.
When are we getting our house back?
- Jess, come on.
- I'm serious.
Look, I feel bad enough
about what my dad did already.
Everybody's always giving Roman
a raw deal.
I mean, he's my brother.
I'm not gonna do that.
I didn't mean it like that. I just...
I know you don't see it,
but he scares me, and I don't trust him.
Remember, I'm the one
that caught him snooping in our bedroom.
Come on, Jess. He's not a bad person.
I pled his case.
I know exactly how bad he is.
JESS:
I can't do this for another 18 months.
- We need to get him into a halfway house.
- RYAN: All right.
As soon as we find a place,
he's out of here.
(CLATTERING)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Hey. I think Roman's
pulling some kind of stunt.
What're you talking about?
Well, he just tore out of here in his car.
and he took all of his stuff with him.
Ryan, you know he's not allowed
to leave the state.
All right, I'm coming back.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
(GASPS)
DR. RAJAN:
They both suffered total cardiac arrest.
Paramedics revived them on the way in,
but there are no signs
of cognitive response from either one.
- We are assessing to see how...
- Which one is my husband?
Can he hear me?
It's possible.
We really can't tell at this stage.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
- Do you want a chair?
- No, I'm not gonna stay long.
Not sure he'd want me to.
I'm sure he appreciates it.
Anything happens, you'll let me know?
Either way?
Of course.
You're sweet.
Just like he said.
Mrs. Bryson?
Can we speak for a moment?
We can keep your husband
on the machines,
so long as there's lower brain function.
And we will keep monitoring,
but it's been three weeks now.
What are you saying?
The chances of him waking are very small.
- Like what?
- There's no way of telling.
It could be months, it could be years,
if he wakes at all.
I'm very sorry.
(NORMAN BARKING)
(DOORBELL RINGING)
JESS: I miss you so much.
I miss hearing your voice.
I dream about it, and then I wake up,
and can't remember what you sound like.
We got about a 50-50 chance
of this thing working out.
- Would you look at that?
- What? What am I looking at?
Jess?
You know, if you're not ready for this...
No, I'm... I am. Just give me a minute?
Okay.
Mr. Bryson, are you all right?
Can you hear me?
He's on secanol,
making him very disoriented.
But they said he was asking for you.
- Any problems with your vision?
- No.
- Your hearing?
- There's a buzzing in my ears.
I'm cold. I can't seem to get warm.
Tell me something about yourself,
something you remember.
My wedding.
So you're married?
I don't see a ring on your finger.
Jess.
I don't know what this is. What happened?
- Please.
- Mr. Bryson, please.
I'm sorry...
Jess, it's me.
There's nothing physical to explain
the disorientation and memory loss.
It should all come back to him
rather quickly.
The fact that he woke up, does that mean
my husband could do the same thing?
They sustained very different injuries.
I'm afraid your husband's condition
has not changed.
NURSE: He's still in shock.
The Haloperidol should keep his
delusions to a minimum.
But he's been awake
in a strange environment for three weeks.
What he really needs right now
is the familiarity of his own home.
His home?
Clearview Street?
That's where he was before the accident?
You're his closest living relative.
You'll have to take him home.
Hi.
Let's go.
Hey, Norman. Come here.
Hey, Norman.
Hey, what's up, boy?
Norman, stop it!
In here.
- You all right?
- I'm fine.
(VOICES ON TV)
Thornton Wilder wrote,
"There's a land of the living,
"and a land of the dead
and the bridge is love,
"the only survival, and the only meaning."
I love this part.
- Jess.
- No. Don't.
Don't say my name like that.
What do you want from me?
I'm scared.
- I don't know what's happening and...
- Come with me.
This is your bed, okay?
These are your things.
This is your life, and I am not part of it.
- Jess, please listen.
- No. don't touch me.
Something happened to me
in that accident.
Look, I don't blame you
for what happened to Ryan, okay?
- Please.
- I just want you to get better.
And move on.
MIRANDA: I would just kick him out.
- I can't do that, Miranda.
- Why not?
The guy's done time for assault,
along with God knows what else.
Look, he's dangerous.
You, of all people, should know that.
- Ryan wouldn't want me to.
- Sorry. I didn't mean...
No, it's okay. I know you're right.
Look, babe. All I'm saying is
you have to do something.
You can't live like this. Right?
Thanks for doing this.
It'll be good for him to see you.
-How's he doing?
-He's not really himself yet.
No shit.
You left it at my place.
- Figured you'd want it back.
- Oh, you must be a friend of Roman's.
Look, I knew you'd still be pissed.
- I'm sorry. I really don't know you.
- What, like, at all?
I'm sorry.
- Want one?
- I don't smoke.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
- What the hell are you doing?
- I want us to talk.
- Fine, Roman, talk.
- Don't call me that.
I've been trying to figure this out.
Trying to remember things.
And it's like everything's there,
but it all happened 100 years ago.
Remember the storm in Cancún?
The alabaster hair band you lost in Maui?
We searched the ocean for hours?
Remember when we went to Pastis,
and the waiter spilled a bottle of Barolo
all over my white shirt?
- No.
- The circus in Kentucky?
- Why are you doing this?
- 'Cause I have no choice.
These are my memories.
Jess...
I love you.
No. No, you don't.
- You're my wife.
- Stop it.
MIRANDA: I don't know what he's doing,
but he's lying to you.
You can't let him get to you.
- What if it's real?
- Jess.
No, I mean it.
What if I could have him back?
What if I could do things right this time?
He was in an accident. It's not your fault.
He used to write me love letters
every week.
And I never wrote him back.
I just let them pile up, like IOUs.
I had the perfect life,
and it just didn't matter
how many people told me,
I took it for granted.
- Thought he'd always be there.
- Jess...
He's not gone.
Sorry, my hands are not working right.
I have something for you.
I fixed it.
Norman.
DR. CREANE: You are disappearing.
You are becoming nothing.
You will hear nothing
but the sound of my voice.
When your heart slows down,
so will your thoughts.
Five...
Four...
Three...
Two...
One.
I want you to go back
to the day of the accident.
Where are you?
What can you see?
White.
Fog.
What else?
I'm driving.
Relax.
Relax.
Go back, go back.
Where are you now?
Birthday.
Whose name is on the cake?
Ryan.
Are you Ryan?
Who are you?
ROMAN: I'm hurting.
DR. CREANE: Say your name.
Roman.
I see Roman.
DR. CREANE: Say your name.
Give me your name.
Give me your one true name.
Clear!
Give me your real name.
Jess!
Take care of Ryan on his journey. Amen.
JESS: I'm so scared, David.
I don't want to believe this.
You can't give up hope, Jessica.
You and Ryan have something spectacular.
a connection most people will never know.
Who are we to place limits
on what that can accomplish?
Jess, you know Ryan better than anyone.
I think you're asking a question
only you can answer.
I can't be alone.
Get out!
Please don't send me back in there.
I keep getting these headaches.
I feel nauseous.
I'm afraid if I lie back down on that bed,
I'm not gonna wake up again.
I can't do this.
It's too much.
Even if...
I need you to go away.
Roman.
Please.
If that's what you want, I'll do it.
You ready?
Where are we going?
You don't remember this place?
Things we used to do?
Look, if you really don't care about me,
then why are you even here?
She asked me to talk to you.
Come on, hit me.
I know you want to. Come on.
She doesn't even like you.
You scare her. You don't have a chance.
I'm not buying it, Roman.
I know who you are.
Happy anniversary.
When we took this picture,
you whispered something to me.
There was an old couple in the park and...
And when I looked at them,
I could only think one thing.
- Our future.
- Our future.
Ryan. Ryan.
Hey.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Just had a bad dream.
Everything's perfect.
When you were gone,
I promised myself
that if you ever came back,
I would change.
That I'd be a better person.
A better wife.
I'm back.
(ROMAN LAUGHING)
Yes?
I never realized how short
you actually are.
- Funny, huh?
- Yeah.
No! No!
Are you okay?
Baby, what's wrong?
I'll be all right.
(PHONE RINGING)
He had a seizure.
We were able to stabilize him
almost immediately,
but now his involuntary
body functions are weakening.
His heart is still beating,
but if his condition deteriorates,
there's no way of knowing how he
would react to another episode like this.
ROMAN: He's suffering.
JESS: That used to be you in there.
Maybe in some way, it still is.
I just think we should do
what's best for him.
We don't know what that is.
We have no idea what will happen
if we turn that machine off.
I'm sorry.
I can't risk it.
I can't lose you again.
(EXCLAIMS)
- Damn it, fucker.
- Hey, there, potty mouth.
Hey, I didn't hear you come in.
Are you happy?
- I couldn't be happier.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Casey.
Yeah, I was wondering why
you never got back to me.
Guess this would do it.
- You do this?
- Yeah.
Never did one of me.
My brother must've
treated you very badly.
I hate you.
No matter what you do to me,
I can't change the way I feel about you.
Anyone can change.
Anyone can change?
Change is choice, right, Roman?
Right?
I feel badly for her.
This is what matters.
This is all that matters.
Casey?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Baby, I'm so sorry. I've been trying to call.
I've got a flat tire.
Can you wait?
He's beautiful.
- He?
- She.
I don't know. Doesn't matter.
God, I wish I was there.
- Me, too. I love you.
- I love you, too.
- I'll see you at home.
- Okay.
Congratulations.
Everything seems just fine.
- Thank you.
- Well, I'm not sure I'm the one to thank.
How long you had this rash on your neck?
Are you allergic to anything?
Not that l know of.
- I'd say it's your necklace then. Is it new?
- Oh, no.
Strange. Could be your body just
adjusting to the hormone change.
Sometimes women develop allergies
during pregnancy.
Is the chain silver?
Cheaper metals cause rashes sometimes.
Oh, don't worry. Nothing serious.
Hey. That was fun.
Remind me never to get a flat
in the rain again.
Well, what's this?
Doesn't even look real.
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm fine.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
It's nothing at all.
All right.
I'm gonna go change.
Hey.
Ah, here you go. Oh, that's my boy.
You're getting fat. I think we're going to
put you on Weight Watchers.
DETECTIVE MILLS:
When did you see her last?
Ms. Bryson?
Not for a while.
Not for weeks. I'm sorry.
So you and Miss Riggs,
you were seeing each other?
- Well...
- They were. But not for some time.
Not a very happy relationship,
I understand.
She was a troubled girl.
If you hear anything...
I'm sure they'll find her.
Sometimes I can feel him.
I have his hands.
His heart.
It's like he's waiting.
He's wanting to come back.
When you look at me,
do you think about him?
Sometimes.
Lucky coin.
Nothing's gone forever.
Jess?
Hi, baby.
Hey, what do you think of Victor?
I think, less thinking, more unpacking.
I love it when you boss me around.
I'm gonna go take this stuff upstairs.
Remember the storm in Cancún?
It's your mother's old silver chain.
The circus in Kentucky?
- These are my memories.
- He's lying to you.
Remember when we went to Pastis,
and the waiter spilled a bottle
of Barolo all over my white shirt?
Memories. Memories. Memories.
There was an old couple in the park and...
And when I looked at them,
I could only think one thing.
Our future. Our future. Our future.
Our future. Our future. Our future.
You're cute, looking at this stuff.
I'm sorry.
No, you... You just scared me.
Are you okay?
Yeah. Hormones.
Okay.
If you're hungry, I'm gonna go fix dinner.
Okay.
I'm just gonna be a minute.
- Hey, Jess, you need anything?
- No, I'm fine.
It's a funny thing, isn't it?
Love?
It's stronger than any of us.
It finds a way somehow.
And once you get it,
you can never let it go.
That's probably why
it was so hard for Roman.
'Cause I think he was in love with you.
And I think he felt like
I stole you from him.
Just because he saw you first.
So he stuck it out,
watching the two of us,
torturing himself.
Can't say I blame him.
We are so lucky.
I want you to come with me.
I think you'll like this.
It's almost finished.
Like it?
What do you think?
I guess I'll keep working on it.
Do not run away from this.
Jess, look at me.
We've worked too hard to get here.
I understand that
you are hurt and confused,
but the truth is
you're happier now than you've ever been.
No.
No, you lied to me.
How sick are you?
You took advantage of me
while my husband was dying.
No.
The only way that I could even stand
to be in the same room with you
was when you were someone else.
First Casey, now you.
Why do you do this?
Why do you all do this?
Why do you turn on me like this?
- What? What did you do?
- I love you. I did it all for you.
We are starting to build a family.
I came back for you. He didn't.
Back for me?
Just the thought of you touching me
makes me sick.
He's lying.
God.
(MACHINE BEEPING)
Come on, Jess, stand up.
Something's wrong.
I'm serious. Something's wrong.
Let me see.
You're hurting me!
- He's dumping his pressure.
- We're down by 25 percent.
- Okay, we're losing him.
- I've got an EEG 5, still falling.
You knew what you were doing with me!
You always knew!
Stop this.
I remember the first time
you looked at me.
I knew what you wanted.
You kept looking at me like that,
even when you were with him.
I will not let you go.
Time of death...
Mrs. Bryson?
I have good news.
The baby will be fine.
What about Ryan?
He had another seizure last night.
He fought it.
He fought hard.
For a moment it seemed
his body wasn't strong enough.
But then, somehow, he pulled through.
I think we're gonna be okay.
We'll get through this.
And...
I've taken a new case.
I think it's something I should do.
But I want you to know...
I need you to know
that when you find your way back,
I will be right here.
And things will be different.
I will be different.
I promise you, baby.
Let me help you.
(ON YOUR OWN PLAYING)
(SINGING) You know I can't save you
You're on your own
You're on your own
No, I just can't help you
You're all alone
You're all alone
You're on your own
You're on your own
You're on your own
You're on your own
You're on your own
You're on your own
You're on your own
On your own
You're on your own
