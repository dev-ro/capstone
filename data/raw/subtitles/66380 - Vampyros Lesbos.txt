THE LESBIAN VAMPIRES
You're very excited.
Not at all.
Linda.
And after that...
everything around me grows dark...
and she sighs and embraces me.
And then I suddenly jump up and I'm awake.
That's what I've been dreaming
every night for weeks.
And everything always repeats itself.
But I have never seen the woman before
nor the places...
where all this happens.
They are always the same places.
I see them as clearly
as if I'd been there often before.
And every time...
And every time I get frightened.
But it's strange.
At the same time this dream stimulates me.
More than once I've had an orgasm
during this dream.
But yesterday I was...
in a nightclub, with Omar.
That woman was there.
I can't tell you how amazed I was...
when I saw her.
It was her.
There was no doubt about it.
She was the woman
who always appears in these dreams.
My dear Linda...
Don't think that your problem is new to me.
There are many women today
who are sexually unsatisfied.
I'll give you the best remedy for it.
Find yourself a lover.
A better lover.
Hello, darling. It took a long time.
- Were you at Dr. Steiner's?
- Yes.
- What did he say?
- Nothing important.
I'm afraid, Omar.
We should stay together
for the next few days.
- Good day.
- Good day.
This is for the boss,
a very urgent matter.
Mr. Simpson asks you to be
particularly discrete in this case.
He is very anxious for our office...
to have the best reputation
for our Turkish clients, too.
I have to go see a certain
Countess Carody in Anatolia immediately.
It's a question of inheritance,
a strange case.
Linda.
BEACH HOTEL
Hello, I'm Linda Westinghouse.
I was given your address.
You are supposed to sail me across
to the Kadidados Islands.
I was told you were coming,
but unfortunately you are too late.
The boat goes across only once a day
and it's gone already.
Could I spend the night somewhere?
Countess Carody has reserved a room
for you here.
We were told that you have come especially
from Istanbul to visit her.
Yes.
Show the lady to her room, Memmet.
It's on the first floor.
I chose the best room for you.
- Thank you very much.
- It's very pretty and very clean.
I've made it up for you myself.
See you tomorrow.
Goodbye, thank you very much.
If you need anything,
call me and I'll come right away.
That's very nice, thank you.
Please excuse me,
I don't want to frighten you...
but you must not go to that island.
And why not?
Death is on that island.
Insanity and death rule that island.
Come to the wine cellar later.
- Memmet, go back to work!
- Wait.
Linda.
Hello.
Is somebody here?
Good morning.
Please come closer.
I'm here on behalf of Simpson & Sons.
Are you Countess Carody?
Yes.
You are Miss Westinghouse.
Yes.
I have a letter announcing your arrival.
You have a beautiful view from here.
Yes. This is my favorite spot.
I love being alone.
It's strange.
I have the feeling that I've been here before.
And that I know you.
I have the same feeling.
It happens quite often.
You must be tired after your trip.
Do you want to take a swim
before we talk about our business?
Yes, that would be nice.
Then let's go for a swim together.
Come on.
Come on.
But I don't have a bathing suit.
You don't have to be shy with me.
Don't be afraid, nobody else can see us.
Come on in.
I haven't found time
to go sunbathing in a long while.
It's nice to lie in the sun naked.
- Especially when you're not alone.
- Yes, that's true.
You look delightful in this suit.
Sit down.
Your inheritance
seems rather unusual to me, Countess.
I've never seen a will of this kind before.
I can believe that.
It wasn't simple to transfer
the property of the deceased to your name.
The deceased still had relatives.
It always belonged to the Dracula family.
Yes, I know.
Could you tell me about Count Dracula?
About his family?
They all come from Hungary, like me.
But his will contained only my name.
"To the woman who had made his life
worth living. "
That's why he left everything to me.
Unfortunately, there aren't many people
who are that generous.
It's wonderful.
He gave me so much.
Later, I will give it to someone else
who deserves it.
If I could be of any assistance...
Perhaps, that's possible.
Maybe earlier than you think.
I like this red wine.
What's wrong?
I have a terrible headache.
Lie down for a moment.
I'll show you to the guest room.
No one will bother you there.
Thank you very much.
Sorry, but I usually never drink wine.
Morpho.
Nadine.
Nadine.
Nadine.
Agra!
What's the matter now?
Pull yourself together. Do you hear me?
That's it.
Be nice and quiet.
- She's coming back. I knew it.
- Yes.
She'll take possession of me again, Doctor.
I'm so happy.
I sense her closeness.
Help me...
- so she doesn't go away again.
- Yes, I'll do what I can.
"The moon will turn red...
"red as blood
and the unreal one will step out...
"of the shadows and choose his victims...
"without pity, cruelly. "
Dr. Seward, could you come please?
Agra had another severe attack.
The same symptoms as before.
Get the injection ready right away.
Agra, how do you feel?
Are you better?
You probably had another hallucination.
Yes.
Was she here again?
Yes.
And I completely dissolved in her.
She was I, and I was she,
and everything around us had vanished.
What's your friend's name?
What's her name? Don't you want to tell me?
Come now, tell me.
Who is she?
My friend...
is the Queen of the Night.
So...
Who are you?
Tell me where I am.
Don't you hear me?
I want to know the meaning of all this.
Stop.
Stay here.
Good morning.
I'm glad
that you've regained consciousness.
How do you feel? Better than yesterday.
Apparently.
What's all this? Who are you?
And where am I?
I'm Dr. Seward.
You're in a private clinic.
The man that was here before
was my assistant.
Would you please tell me your name?
I don't know it anymore.
You are a foreigner, aren't you?
I don't know.
What happened?
I don't know.
I can't remember anything.
- What do you want?
- I'd like to see Dr. Seward.
Have a seat.
What can we do for you?
I saw your ad in the paper.
Yes. And?
A girl has been found unconscious
on the beach.
And so?
- I believe she's my girlfriend.
- What's her name?
Linda Westinghouse.
She is a lawyer with Simpson & Simpson.
And why do you assume
that she is your girlfriend?
- Because she's disappeared.
- What do you mean?
Well, she left her hotel
without saying where she was going...
and has not come back yet.
Maybe you had an argument
with your girlfriend earlier?
I apologize, but there are certain reasons
for the question.
No.
If it's really her.
Your friend has suffered a shock...
but now she's better.
Go to her.
Let's go.
It was terrible.
I don't know what happened
on that strange island.
My memory is gone.
The sea was all around me.
All I remember is being alone on a ship.
The sea was all around me.
Then, everything stops.
All I still see is a woman.
A naked woman lying dead
in a swimming pool.
It was the Countess Carody.
Is it possible that all this was only a dream?
Don't think about it anymore.
You must forget all this
as soon as possible.
We should take a vacation,
that would be good.
Try taking a few days off.
I'll try to do the same.
Thank you, Omar, it's nice of you.
This was my parents' house.
Was it 100...
or 200 years ago?
I was very young then, all alone.
From my window
I could see the soldiers looting...
and raping the women on the street.
They broke into our house, too,
and pounced on me.
I tried to resist and cried with pain.
And, suddenly, there was the Count.
Count Dracula.
He stuck his dagger into the back...
of the soldier who was lying on top of me.
The man screamed...
and I felt his blood running down my body.
He was the first man in my life.
It was horrible.
I felt like...
I was losing my mind.
Then I realized...
that the Count was bending over me...
and he whispered into my ear:
"I will relieve you of all your troubles. "
When I woke up that night
he was lying by my side.
His body was cold...
but his lips burned like fire.
Night after night he came
and took from my blood...
new life for himself.
When he realized...
that I was gradually losing my strength...
he initiated me
into the secrets of the vampires.
Why did he do that?
He had in some manner
become addicted to me.
I owe it to him that I belong
to the circle of the initiated.
I still can't touch men, I hate them all.
But many have become my slaves.
Many women, too. You understand?
I have bewitched them.
They have lost their own willpower.
I have become them.
But then I met Linda.
And now I am under her power.
I must...
initiate her into our circle.
Linda.
Linda.
I've been waiting for you.
This is blood.
Did you know
that you've been drinking blood?
Now you have been taken into our covenant.
From now on,
the Queen of the Night will take you...
onto her black wings.
"Konvec Nishe Vehach. "
"Konvec Nishe Vehach. "
Nadine.
No.
He's still a little weak.
He's lost a lot of blood, but it's not too bad.
Maybe the same thing happened to him
as to me.
Maybe I have contaminated him?
Linda dear,
I find you delightful and charming...
but, excuse me saying for saying so,
of occult issues...
you have not the faintest idea.
You have no authority
about supernatural processes.
You should've seen
how pale Omar was when I came back...
and there were two strange marks
on his neck.
Excuse the interruption,
but Agra has had another attack.
Can you come?
I'll be over right away.
I spent a great part of my life
studying vampires.
May I ask you to come with me.
I can immediately recognize those who are
able to have contact with those forces...
and those who are not.
Your friend will never be able
to penetrate that world.
It will always remain closed to him.
That's why it's impossible for him
to become enslaved by those forces.
With you, Linda, it's different.
You are in danger.
That's what I thought.
Doctor, at times I find myself
in strange circumstances...
doing things that I don't want to do.
It's like a strange call from nowhere.
You have been chosen
by the Spirits of the Night.
I fear these powers myself.
But just the same I will have to find out
about this phenomenon.
I am one of the few people...
who know how one
can possibly protect oneself.
I will tell you...
if you so desire.
Yes. Do it.
The foundation is the energy of life.
The will to free oneself.
When a vampire is killed...
its physical appearance vanishes.
The brain has to be hit fatally.
You have to try either...
to split the head with this axe...
or to pierce him with this pole.
What is it?
What happened? Calm down.
She was inside me.
And now she's left me.
No one can rescue me.
Why not?
Because now she is gone.
Why shouldn't there be a way to save you?
Come here.
You have to trust me and tell me everything,
do you understand, Agra?
No, it's too late. Much too late.
Now you can't help me anymore.
All right.
She's just told me that she is coming back.
She wants to come back to me again...
to meet you.
- How do you feel?
- Better, thank you.
I wanted to ask you
if I could leave the clinic now.
Certainly. You can go whenever you want,
there is no more danger for you.
I am worried about Linda, Doctor.
She's been strange lately.
She did not answer my questions...
as if she was somewhere else
with her thoughts.
And whenever she said anything...
her sentences were totally disconnected.
She feels better now.
You don't need to worry.
But why is she weaker...
everyday?
She will not be able to survive a new attack.
I told your girlfriend what she has to do...
and now it only depends...
on her power of resistance.
If those powers are strong enough
she will pass the danger point.
- That I promise.
- Many thanks, Doctor.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Stop.
Don't go.
You must help me.
They don't let me talk to anybody.
But I escaped.
They locked me up as if I were crazy.
But I'm as normal as you are.
But why did they lock you up?
Because they're idiots who don't know...
that I can host supernatural powers.
You must...
You must go to her house.
You know...
the old house of Uskulan,
high above on the mountain.
Tell her that she must help me.
She's there now.
Tell her.
But be careful...
she will hate you...
because you are a man.
Lock her up again.
You escaped again?
I swear this'll be the last time.
Go away!
I never want to see you
in this house again. Go now!
Where is Miss Westinghouse?
She doesn't live here anymore.
When did she leave?
She paid her bill yesterday.
- But where could she have gone?
- I don't know.
The more I study...
the phenomena of vampires...
the more attracted I am
by this mysterious world...
which summons its mysterious powers
out of unknown depths.
Powers which remain inaccessible to
most of us.
I can barely resist the temptation...
to pass the threshold which will open...
the dark regions of the supernatural for me.
I don't want to disturb you, Doctor.
What's the matter?
I just wanted to ask
if you need anything else.
No, thank you.
- I'll quit now, too.
- Agra has quieted down, she is asleep.
Fine, see you tomorrow, Melnik.
Good night.
Who are you?
You know, so why do you ask?
I've been waiting for many years
to make your acquaintances.
Why?
Why do you want to meet me?
You come from areas which I seek to enter.
Only with your help shall I succeed
in connecting to this world and to come...
into contact with the supernatural powers.
You are trying to take Linda away from me.
You can never obtain
my friendship this way.
I did it only to make you come to me.
And what do you expect from me?
I want to change into one of you.
Help me to fulfill my wish.
"Konvec Nishe Vehach. "
Silence.
Our magic formula is useless in your mouth.
Whoever has been our enemy once
will lose every battle...
and will never step over the threshold
leading to our empire.
But why are you here?
Because I have to get rid of you.
You will not succeed.
Sanctus spiritus benedictus...
aberatio aberni mandatinolent.
Morpho.
I came to say goodbye to you.
I have to leave you forever.
"The famous scientist Aldon Seward
was assassinated last night.
"Someone saw two people dressed in
black leaving the scene of the crime. "
Ah, it's you.
How is your girlfriend?
Have you read this?
Yes.
They killed this charlatan
who researched vampires.
What do you have to do with it?
Linda has disappeared.
There can be no doubt
that she is in the hands of the murderers.
My dear friend, you seem
to have too much imagination.
It is much more probable
that she's found another man.
Another crime was committed
that same night.
A dancer killed her partner,
biting through her jugular vein.
This dancer is the connection to Linda.
I finally managed to find out
where she lives.
And where is that?
In an old house in Uskulan.
I can't leave you alone. I'm going with you.
You are here...
to meet the people of the night,
Dracula's heirs.
Now you are mine,
in this night of darkness, of apocalypse.
You are beautiful when you're afraid...
but just how beautiful will you be
when you die?
Yes, scream, nobody will hear you.
Ever since my wife left me,
I have been searching for a new one.
My wife's name was Agra...
and one day she went to this terrible woman
who lives on the island.
When she came back, she was bewitched.
She was insane.
The doctor has locked her up
in his sanatorium.
You will die a sweet death.
You will ask...
beg to live.
But even while you're dying you'll kiss me.
And tell me that you can't live without me.
I want your blood, you see?
Your blood and to hear you scream.
Let me loosen those ropes.
You shall be free in your death,
experience your awesome pain.
Leave me, please, leave me.
You shall beg for my love.
My hatred and my love for you are infinite.
Your blood is red as death.
This beauty.
Divine and yet evil.
I will do this to you.
You have the power to choose.
Tell me if you want to let me take control
like the others did.
They were happy.
Come, I'll show you.
In my arms, under my torture, she received...
the greatest happiness.
- Her death was love.
- I want to love you, too.
- Yes, darling.
- I love you.
Yes, in pain everybody loves me.
It was like a game when I hung her.
I will play this game with you.
Just as you like it.
You'll feel something
that you have never felt before.
We will both be perfect...
and enjoy my suffering.
I want it like that, too.
I will do it just like you want me to.
You just have to loosen the ropes.
- I will do that, yes.
- Go ahead, do it.
It will be great for both of us.
Yes.
You are so beautiful.
Nadine.
Open up.
Nadine. Open up.
What's the matter with you? What's wrong?
It's the end...
for me.
Can I do something for you, Nadine?
Yes, only you can help me.
Only your blood can give me
my strength back again.
No, I don't want to belong to you.
You want to leave me?
It's the end.
It has to be.
I don't want to become like you.
That's why I have to do it.
Linda.
Come, Dr. Steiner! Quickly.
I don't understand.
It was a bad dream, Linda.
Nothing else.
No. It was not a dream.
Even though it may seem unbelievable.
Even though there might not be
an explanation for it.
The horror of these days will fade...
but the memories will always stay vivid.
As long as I live.
THE END
