Wakey, wakey, Mr. Cleg.
Not in bed, please.
I trust you slept well sir.
The bed in this house has a curious...
... character.
But one does grow used to it after...
... just a few years.
I will not... I will not be here that long.
Nor did I expect to be, but...
... it is a loud world.
and this... is an Island.
But... an Island sir...
... ruled by a tyrant queen.
Has the power to send any one of us
back to where we came from.

Perhaps you'd share
your thoughts with me sometime.
Mr. Cleg?
How much shirts are you wearing?
One, two, three...

Oh... indeed it is madam.

the more the need for clothes.
Brilliant.
Wing of a seagull
It... could have gone nowhere else.

Aren't you clever.
You're so good with your hands.

Dad?
Dad?
Dad?
Dad...
Now don't you say a word.
Well...
It was different when I was a girl.
We lived out in the country then.
Essex.
I remember how I'd go across
the fields in the morning...
And I'd see the webs in the trees.
Like clouds of muslin they were.
what, spider's webs?
Spider's webs...
Of course spider's webs.
They always makes webs?
then
look up close
I'd see they wasn't muslin at all
They were wheels.
Great big shiny wheels...
- You know what else?
- what?
If you knew where to look,
you could find the spider's egg bags.
Perfect little things they were.
Tiny little silk pockets she made...
to put her eggs in.
What happened to her
after she layed her eggs?
You like this bit, don't you?
She just crawled away
without looking back once.
And then she died?
Her work was done.
She had no more silk left.
She's all dried up and empty.
You ready then?
As ready as I'll ever be.
and you!
you guard the house. Allright?
What'll you have then?
Gin and orange for me, Billy.
- Evening Bill.
- Evening Ernie.
Pint of bitters please and then
gin and orange for the misses.
Gin and orange...
I've seen more meat on a butcher's apron.
I felt that.
I says to him, I says
"Is that the best you can do?"
You want to take it up with...
see what smart people have to say about it.
Getting an eyeful are you?
It's that fat tart... Yvonne Wilkinson
- Cheers Ernie
- Cheers
Some fat tart... Yvonne Wilkerson...
gin with...
Don't drink so fast, Bill.
Fancy another one?
No, not ready for another one yet...
He turns to me and I say:
"Nora, Nora... there's no hurry."
So back comes Nora
she's on him right away
Next thing she's got half of London...
all over her.
She's standin there laughing.
"What are you laughing at?", I says.
and that ain't all she said...
"Look at him, more like Tom Thumb"
"Tom Thumb," I says,
"what about, what about Tiny Tim?"
how we laughed.
Now that he's dead,
that's another story.
that was a right little heartbreak.
I wouldn't let him near me.
He told me today I said.
I say to him, I says
"I have the decorador, then"
know what I mean.
Yvonne Wilkinson
She made the first move.
