     SAMIRA: How d'you know
          all of this?
      HOLLY: I asked Gary.
 SAMIRA: Gary? So none of this
   has come from Robert then?
    KELLY: You've never even
    talked to him, have you?
          HOLLY: Um...
 No, but, like, Gary said he's
 like proper fucked up his arm.
Like ripped the skin right off.
   Holly, I don't wanna know.
  I'd love it if my boyfriend
     tried to kill himself
         'cause I died.
  But he didn't kill himself,
            did he?
        He's back here,
        stacking shelves
        on minimum wage.
       All right, but...
      imagine being fucked
    by someone that intense.
Has anyone ever told you you're
  a really weird little girl?
      KELLY: Anyway don't
         kid yourself.
   You don't wanna fuck him.
      You wanna be the one
       that IDs the body
 when he finally gets it right.
  Nah. She wants to save him.
           Don't ya?
       You won't be able
       to fix him, Holly.
   If she ever speaks to him,
            that is.
    DAVID: You've been like
           my angel.
   You know, like everything
   with Mum and Dad and crap
       and all that shit
          with Steve.
         I don't know.
   I just don't think that...
  Look, it's not been working
      for a while, has it?
   I'm sorry about the bear.
  I just wanted to, you know.
       Can we be friends?
           Oh, yeah.
    No, that would be cool.
  Of course we can be friends.
        So you're not--
          You're okay?
             Yeah.
   I just think I'm a bit...
      A bit dark for you.
             Dark?
      I mean... I mean...
     You're a bit vanilla.
             What?
  I mean you're just so nice.
       Not that that's--
      I mean, it's great.
  You're a lovely person and--
        Fuck off, David.
   You know nothing about me.
       Whoa! Whoa! Easy!
           You okay?
       Samira, get a mop,
      clean this up, yeah?
      Let me have a look.
        I'm a paramedic.
       I'm a paramedic...
            trainee.
I'm a student when I'm not here
      at the supermarket.
             Can I?
      I heard you came off
           your bike.
       I'm gonna sell it.
    I thought it'd be better
        in the open air.
 At least you're not in a box.
You should have kept this moist.
       It might scar now.
     I know. They told me.
     What you listening to?
   What are you listening to?

         No, you don't.
            Orange?
     That's a pomegranate.
      Whatever. It's free.
   What made you talk to me?
No one else in that place does.
 They stare at me and treat me
  like I'm gonna kill myself.
   Well, you do a pretty good
          impression.
      [diesel horn honks]
            Come on!
      It's the short cut!
      Cinema's over there!
    You're too good for me,
 and I don't want to hurt you.
  HOLLY: You're not going to.
    BEN: Now, the eagle-eyed
          amongst you
    will notice I'm wearing
     a funny costume today.
    But the thing is that's
out of respect for the uniform.
  You don't go shopping in it.
       You don't go down
       to the pub in it,
     even though you think
     you might pull in it.
           [laughter]
It's not just a uniform for me.
    It tells the whole world
           who I am.
  Even though we're all here,
 none of us are wearing green.
       But don't forget.
       You are different
     from the others here.
  You're not a media student,
 not a sports science student.
     You're training to be
          a paramedic.
   And training doesn't begin
  when you put on the uniform.
       It starts up here.
            ¶¶ [rock]
         BEN: Three Ds.
           Discipline.
     You're not just wearing
    the uniform to look good.
         Determination.
       To live up to what
       the uniform means.
          And finally,
   most importantly of all...
            distance.
  When you put on that uniform,
 it sets you apart from others.
  Doesn't make you superhuman.
           Some people
       you will not save.
            ¶¶ [rock]
           Oh, shit!
       Rob, I'm so sorry.
       I'm so, so sorry.
        You're so sweet.
           [giggles]
           [laughing]
          Oh, my God.
            Fuck me.

      [moaning continues]
         Oh, fuck yeah.
           Oh, fuck.
      Yeah, grab my feet.
  Oh, my God, that's amazing.
   I'm not holding your feet.
      Oh, God, not again.
          What the...
            Where...
              Rob?
         Are you there?
        What's going on?
             Nina?
              Rob.
           It is you.
          HOLLY: Rob.
       What is happening?
          Who's this?
          You're dead.
     You're-  You're dead.
   Who the fuck is this girl?
       Rob, who is this?
  Come on, Rob, introduce us.
            Nina...
     This is Holly, who...
    works in the supermarket
            with me.
            Holly...
      This is Nina, my...
          Girlfriend.
            Dead...
          Girlfriend.
         This isn't...
           [laughing]
     This isn't happening!
      How could you, Rob?
      Rob, she isn't real.
         She... isn't!
            [laughs]
     NINA: How old is she?
        No, you can't--
          You're dead!
      Sure, but I've kept
         my standards.
           I mean...
          supermarket?
      ROB: Holly, just go.
             You...
            This...
         This is my...
    Uh, you should just go.
            You can.
   You should just leave me.
 HOLLY: This has to be a dream.
           Oh, fuck!
         Can't be real.
     I can't believe this.
     You're my boyfriend's
      dead ex-girlfriend.
    You think I'm his ex ex?
            I'm not.
      And don't even think
        about calling me
     his late ex-girlfriend
 because that gives completely
     the wrong impression.
         I'm not an ex.
          You're dead!
 Doesn't mean we're on a break
        though, does it?
          Get the fuck
       out of my bedroom.
   NINA: You have to help me,
            my love.
 ROB: I can't. I can't. Please.
    NINA: I think I remember
     six or seven seconds.
        My mouth filled
       with my own blood.
      And then no change.
             - Rob.
  - Just the mortuary slab...
        with you and Dad
  bonding over my naked body.
       I don't want this.
     And then the funeral.
      Then you... and her.
       I don't want this.
        Rob, just move.
         Kiss me, Rob.
      Kiss me, beautiful.
             [sobs]
          Kissing you
    isn't how it used to be.
              Ow!
             Holly!
           Ow, fuck!
          Fuck's sake.
    Wait here for a minute.
             Holly!
          Holly, wait.
             Fuck.

  Oh, you'll check your phone
 whilst giving mouth-to-mouth,
           will you?
       Hello? Yeah, uh...
        Ah, we lost him.
  Shame, I know, but I did get
   a text from my boyfriend.
           Oh, sorry,
    I don't mean boyfriend.
 I mean supermarket fuck buddy.
    Keep pumping the chest.
  You don't want to lose him.
 - The doll, I mean, not the--
       - Fuck off, Josh.
     - [indistinct chatter]
     - [loud music playing]
         You all right?
 Look like you've seen a ghost.
      How are things going

   Has he mentioned her yet,
        dead girlfriend?
       It came up, yeah.

             Sorry.
       That sounds so...

       - I mean you can.

 SALLY: God, the bulbs are out,
          did you see?
     First sign of spring.
           ROB: Yeah.
     Spring would be nice.
     DAN: Is Rob here yet?
      SALLY: Yes, he's in
     the front room. He's--
     I think he's come off
        his bike again.
         DAN: Oh, God,
    is he still doing that?
      - Don't mention it.
      - Of course I won't.
           Hey, Rob.
        Good to see you.
         How's things?
        Yeah. You know.
             Yeah.
              Yep.
 Drink before the performance.
   I've certainly earned it.
    - Have you been writing?
    - Well, I call it that.
      Did you get to read
    that chapter I sent you?
 SALLY: That's how Martin Amis
         does it, Rob.
     Gets all his feedback
 from reluctant dinner guests.
  Rob's not reluctant, is he?
     Why does he come here
          every week?
 - Well, not to read your book.
 - You don't mind, do you, Rob?
      Well, how's he going
        to answer that?
     DAN: He's a free man.
 He can say whatever he wants.
  When did she do the painting
       in the front room?
   It was her A-level piece.
          Very strong.
        Best one there.

        [scraping plate]
    SALLY: Have you thought
       any more about...
starting up your studies again?
         I'm not sure.
    Feel like my maths brain
         has dried up.
     Seems a bit pointless.
          And working
    in a supermarket isn't--
      You're sounding like
  a nagging grandmother, Sal.
   So... how's that motorbike
         of yours, Rob?
      Quite a mean machine
       you've got there.
             Yeah.
           It's fine.
  I used to have a Moto Guzzi
          myself once.
      This is ridiculous.

          Do you mind?
         No. Of course.
       Oh, you don't have
        to read it now.
  I just really like this bit.

   in the urinal before him.
    Reaching inside himself,

        with his hands."
     You know what I mean?
      That just came out!
       "With his hands."
           You know.
   I will. I'll... definitely
     read the rest of this.
          This is all
      a new thing for me.
     But that-- that's why
    it's so good, you know?
      Scary, but exciting,
           you know?
           [chuckles]
   It'd be good for you to--
         I mean, uh...
     Not that it has to be
           that PhD.
  You could do anything, Rob.
   Don't let her put you off.
     Take care, won't you?
   - I'll see you next week.
            - Okay.
            [knocks]
           Is she...
     Do you want her to be?
              No.
     I thought you'd gone.
      You stopped texting.
         There you go.
    Jesus, you're freezing.
        She'll be there.
          We can cope.
             What?
         Are you okay?
             Okay.

     zigzagging in my eyes.
        [Nina laughing]
    I have a shard of glass
   in the back of my throat,
        and that's about
        all I can feel.
    You might as well stop.
   - I wanna make you happy.
            - Stop.
        He's using you.
    God, Rob, she is young.
 Naked, you could pass for 16.
        You're not old.
              No.
           I'm dead.
         If I was just
      his old girlfriend,
 then I could see why you'd get
 your frothy little hopes up,
             but..
            come on.
       That first morning
when I was naked in the sunshine
         by the window,
       pushing his hands
         into the sand
   as we fucked on the beach
          in Cornwall.
          Or the time
       I went down on him
          on the sofa
   in my parents' front room,
    just before he met them
      for the first time.
             [sobs]
          These things
     will stay in his head
  precisely because I am dead.
     You're an oil painting
       that's still wet.
       Any good memories
        you slather out
    will just get mushed in
     by what happens next.
        I have no next.
             Nina.
  Holly is my girlfriend now.
  I don't know how we're gonna
  deal with this... situation,
   but that's just how it is.
         No, it isn't.
       We never broke up.
    - You died. I couldn't.
       - Did you want to?
             - No.
         - Well, then.
- I'm breaking up with you now.
          - You can't.
  - What do you mean? Why not?
      - Because I'm dead.
       Didn't change you
       very much, did it?
Well, that's sort of the point.
   Why do you always have to
   be like this when we row?
  I'm not being like anything.
           I'm dead.
  I'm very literally not being
     like anything at all.
    Holly is my girlfriend,
       and you are dead,
      and that means that
 we can't be together anymore.
  You can't expect me to be on
my own for the rest of my life.
          You're not.
       This doesn't mean
     I'm gonna forget you.
   What the fuck do you think
       you mean by that?
       You're impossible.
ROB: I never know what you want.

  HOLLY: I think that I should
      give her a memorial.
     I know there's a grave
  but she's not there, is she?
  Besides, I want to show her
          how I feel.
  ROB: You know you were right
        about her grave.
        She's not there.
  She's not anyplace, is she?
   I used to take flowers to
the road where she died, but...
       it's just a field
      with a broken fence.
    You know, what matters,
    all that matters is us.
            You, me,
         Sally and Dan,
     what we carry with us.
  Like when I came off my bike
      the first time, I...
   I wanted a lorry to come.
    I wanted to be crushed.
       Lose my legs or...
        I wanted scars,
   so she'd always be there.
       But you're right.
        This is better.
   She drew it on my T-shirt
   one night when we were out
         to wind me up.
  She'd decided I'd die first.
      Put a picture of me
     being eaten by sharks.
    Put my name and a date.
  So I said, "What about you?"
   She said she'd never die,
    and wrote it underneath.
   So was it after her crash
     that you had it done?
       Nope. That night.
  Neither of us felt permanent
  marker was permanent enough.
     Her art was all about
        leaving a mark,
   like a needle in a record.
     She loved letterpress.
         Old printing.
    Seeing the indentation.
   The impression stuff made
           always...
     Are you sure you wanna
      hear all this shit?
        Yeah, of course.

         Don't know why
       you bought white.
      What the hell, Rob?
   You're branding them now?
        It was her idea.
   I know what this is about.
         You're scared
      you'll be forgotten.
       You don't want me
  to take your place. I won't.
         I never will.
        You can go now.
       I'm honoring you.
          Jesus wept.
You're a very silly little girl,
       aren't you, Holly?
This has nothing to do with me.
           It's him.
   Oblivion would beat this.
     Would beat lying next
   to the heat of your heart
     beating in your little
         living chest.
 The smell of your sweet stink
    rising between your legs
    as my boy puts his hand
       inside your pussy.
      Nina, don't do this.
 I'm just-- I'm trying to help.
           I'm sorry.
        No, you're not.
     You didn't even notice
I didn't do anything this time.
     You just rode him like
  a little toy rocking horse.
    No. Last time you said--
 I'm not doing this to get off.
       I don't want this.
        I don't... want.
             Fine.
     Far as I'm concerned,
 the least you could have done
      was leave me a book.
           Right now
    that'll be my pleasure.
    You know, I'll fuck him
     all day and all night
  and leave a fucking library
            for you.
    You won't drive me away.
    Trust me. I don't intend
        to drive again.
   I've had a bad experience.
        Rob, are you...
 are you going to say anything?
        What can I say?
          I love you.
         [Nina giggles]
  But it's me he can't forget.
       I'm honoring you.
    You won't be forgotten.
         Don't you see?
      That is the problem.
      And you've certainly
      made that one worse.
- Do you want her to come back?
           - ROB: No.
      But I don't know how
       to make her stop.
        [siren blaring]
 Would you meet Nina's parents,
         Sally and Dan?
        O-Okay, but I--
      - How's that gonna--
    - I think I need you to.
     You know, to show them
         I'm moving on.
           With you.
 Perhaps she'll accept it too.
    HOLLY: So what the hell
         was that, Rob?
        SALLY: I'm sorry
        I forgot to ask.
       Is there anything
     you don't eat, Holly?
     We're having a roast.
     Um, I'm a vegetarian.
         Oh. Um, well,
   there's potatoes and peas.
  It's no bother. I'll, um...
        I can do omelet.
         I didn't think
     it would go like that.
     Dan's writing a novel.
           Oh, cool.
      Is that what you do?
            - Uh...
       - [loud stirring]
         No. It's a...
       It's a new thing.
           Our friend
    the maths PhD over there
        helped me set up
        my writing den.
    SALLY: And every Sunday
          poor old Rob
 has to come over and give his
opinion on the latest chapters.
         Every Sunday?
        Why don't I know
      about your PhD, Rob?
        Why don't I know
      anything about you?
             What?
 Should I be writing equations
    on the fucking windows?
   HOLLY: Are you all right?
           I'm sorry.
          It's just...
          It's just...
   HOLLY: What just happened?
     SALLY: You're sitting
        in Nina's chair.
          Oh, my God.
  What was with the mum, Rob?
         What was that?
 - If I can help in any way...
  - No, just leave him to it.
      If there's anything
          I can do...
   It's just something we all
  have to live with, isn't it?
          We just have
       to keep on living.
         Don't we, Rob?
           So, Holly,
    what books do you like?
  I don't really-- Textbooks.
   But I mean I don't really
      enjoy reading those.
     So do you really have
      to go to university
   to be an ambulance driver?
           Paramedic.
 So first time away from home.
 I bet your mother misses you.
     What are you, twenty?
     Uh, no, I'm nineteen.
   I guess Rob is your first
       proper boyfriend.
         They need me.
        Fine. Whatever.
             Holly!
     Excuse me, I'm just--
           Thank you.
           I'm sorry.
             Holly!
   Come on, look, I'm sorry.
        Don't ignore me.
      Oh, come on, Holly,
stop being so fucking childish.
  What's there to talk about?
         You wanna fuck
   your ex-girlfriend's mum.
        Fuck off, Holly!
  Just 'cause I hold her hand
          doesn't mean
      I want to actually--
     Can we talk about this
        somewhere else?
    - Do you wanna sit here?
       - No, you're fine.
       It just felt like
     I mean nothing to you.
           I'm sorry.
    I'm all she's got left.
        And I wanted her
     to meet you because...
          I love you.
           - Do you?
       - Yes, I love you.
             [ding]
           Prove it.
       God, you are dark.
     Finally, he realizes!
          [Rob laughs]
- Oh, Jesus, it's fucking cold!
  - Shh! Someone will hear us.
  I really don't fucking care!
          [Rob laughs]
           I'm sorry.
         Oh, fuck yeah.
      Say goodbye to her.
        Don't you think
       that's a bit rude?
           - [gasps]
          - What the--
             Fuck!
           Ugh! Fuck!
         What the fuck
      are you doing here?
     Where else would I be?
    I'm not gonna apologize
    if that's what you want.
   We make each other happy!
   You don't make happiness.
     It blooms on anything
   you don't scrub too hard.
          Nina, stop!
 You don't think this is love,
         do you, Holly?
          I mean sure,
   he's made you feel useful.
  Every drop of semen that has
    trickled down your belly
 has been a splash of sunshine
  on his grief-stricken brow.
      But basically you're
      Florence Nightingale
          job-sharing
      with Linda Lovelace.
          Jesus, Nina!
  This is fucking ridiculous.
 Nina, come on. Is this really
  how you want to say goodbye?
   No, but neither was going
     through the windscreen
     of a Triumph Spitfire,
    but sometimes you don't
      get a choice, honey.
           Besides...
   you never can say goodbye.
             Ever.
             What?
    What are you doing here?
       Don't even mention
      the word "closure."
        Face it, Holly.
You've been swaddled and carried
    your whole life through.
  All these fucking lectures?
       You know nothing.
        You mean nothing.
         To him or me.
         You can't even
   put your own trousers on.
     Would you just stop?!
             Nina.
     This is the end, Nina.
 I'm saying goodbye to you now.
 I'm never gonna see you again.
           Poor Rob.
    I'm clearing everything
        out of the flat.
    There's not going to be
  a single trace of you left.
 I think he's going to ask you
      to move in with him.
      Do you think you can
      manage that, Holly?
      Living in my house?
      Do you really think
       you can eradicate
    every last trace of me?
              Yes.
       I love you, Holly.
              Yes.
      [door knob turning]
           After you.
 You know you won't be able to
see her parents anymore, right?
 I mean, if this is gonna work.
        Yeah, no, yeah.
           I figured.
            ¶¶ [rock]

  ROB: Would a car be useful?
    HOLLY: What d'you mean?
            For you.
     Now that you're here,
     rather than on campus.
        Yeah, all right.
           [giggles]
    What if I sold the bike?
    Rob, you can't do that.
             What?
        I don't ride it.
         It's a waste.
       I think walking is
    all I'm about ready for.

     Yup. That's where mine
          used to go.
         Can't believe
  you threw all my shit away.
  The least you could've done
       was gone to Oxfam.
        Yup. There too.
      Well, this is weird.
Why do you think I'm still here?
        Okay, ignore it.
     Good idea, sugar lump.
         You can finish
       reading it for me.
        Fuck you, Nina.
    You already tried that.
       Rob is never gonna
         see you again.

        [alarm chiming]
    NINA: You missed a bit.
     ROB: Hiya! Did you see
 the letterpress sold on eBay?
    I said we'd deliver it,
    Could be your first trip
        in your new car.
     Holly, what the fuck?
     Why is this all white?
         [door closes]
     Is that... a new top?
    SALLY: If I was her,
    I'd want you for myself
    for the whole weekend!
     You know what I mean.
        You deserve it.
            Thanks.
    I don't just mean, um...
     I couldn't get through
          without you.
             Sorry.
          I don't mean
       to offload on you.
     No, it's-- it's okay.
          I can't even
    walk out on him, can I?
       I mean, I could...
       walk out of here.
 But it's all the other stuff,
           you know.
        How can you take
      30 years of hang-ups
    into a new relationship?
    Wouldn't stand a chance,
           would it?
    Oh, you won't leave us,
           will you?
     No. No, of course not.
    This'll be good though,
           won't it?
      Get to see the sea.
     Drop this off to them
        in the morning.
     Make a weekend of it.
        Go to the beach.
     We could do anything.
      What are you doing?
      I dropped my phone.
       Come on. Let's go.
      Getting out of here
will do us both a world of good.
     HOLLY: You're driving.
        ROB: Yup. Sure.
        All right, mate?
        After all that,
   I bet they don't want it.
   "It didn't look that heavy
           on eBay."
 Don't mess me about, old man.
      I'm a motherfucking
         Power Seller.
 So what d'you want to do now?
Fancy that chip shop we passed?
            Ah! Oh!
      What are you doing?
          - Printing.
          - Ah ha ha!
         - Stay still!
             - Uh!
          - Oh, shit.
           - [laughs]
  So... what's happening about
      fish and chips then?

         - Oh, my God.

          Scratch me.
              Hmm?
          Scratch me.
         Make me bleed.
       I-I don't want to.
             Wuss.
   Whoa, whoa, whoa! Come on.
     You'll break your arm.
     You are such a pussy.
             - Oww!
     - Nina! Please! Stop!
         Shut up, Rob.
    This is what she wanted.
This is what darkness is, Holly.
  Flesh trapped between metal.
         Metal on bone.
   Almost makes me nostalgic.
        Oh, I can almost
       taste the petrol.
  - Please, I don't want this.
        - Tough... shit.
    You won. You fixed him.
        Shame you don't
       want him anymore.
    What do you want, Nina?
            Nothing.
  Honey, you know it's not me
       bringing me back.
     Even if he's not here,
 you've let me under your skin.
    This is what you've won.
      I'll always be here.
 It's not true. It's my fault.
       It's all my fault.
            Get off!
  You should thank me, really.
       Now is definitely
   the right time to end it.
  You're not ready for someone
who doesn't need fixing, Holly.
          A quiet job,
     pint on the weekends,
   it's rushing towards you,
      coming to crush you.
    Oh, fuck! Are you okay?
         I'm so sorry.
       I'm so, so sorry.
          [whimpering]
     NINA: It's got nothing
      to do with you, Rob.
            I can't.
    I can't do this anymore.
      I can't look at you
      without seeing her.
        It's never going
      to work out, is it?
           [knocking]
  If you don't mind me saying,
    that's a very living way
  of looking at the situation.
 I'm mean, from my perspective,
      it already hasn't...
          worked out.

            - Okay.
     So then, Rob, old son,
    what's the celebration?
          I got a job
       as a data analyst.
Brilliant! Oh, well done, mate!
     That's brilliant news!
        Yeah, well done.
            Thanks.
       Yeah, and, well...
            thanks.
    You know, that's why...
     Just... to say thanks.
             I see.
   I just mean that isn't...
  This isn't actually helping
      any of us. I mean...
 I mean me being the one person
  you can both bear to be with
       - isn't exactly...
     - No. That's not fair.
       ...isn't actually
     helping anyone, is it?
      Well, that's funny.
   Because I'd say we've been
     helping you massively.
  That's not what I'm saying.
  You think you've been doing
     all of it on your own?
You think it's been easy for us,
          seeing you?
 Supporting you all through it?
    Helping you get back on
   your feet, find a new job,
  shaking you out of the lows,
        all the while...
           having you
     as a constant reminder
   that our daughter is dead
        and you're not?!
      And I do mean that!
       I'm sorry, but you
    can't help but think...
       You can't help...
       but look at kids,
    I mean people your age,
        and not think...
   why are they still there,
         and she isn't?
     Like that bloody child
       you paraded at us
    like some fucking ghost
          of our girl.
  Well, you can do that, Rob.
   You can find someone else.
           We can't.
       So don't sit there
  thinking that we've not been
     doing anything for you
    because we bloody have.
           I'm sorry.
           [panting]
    Hold on, Josh, one sec.
         What, did I do
        something wrong?
           ¶¶ [rock]
       You are so kinky!
      Holly, I think I...
         Just fuck me.
            [grunts]
            Please.
             Please!
              No!
            Oh, God,
     Holly, you're amazing!
          Please, no.
     JOSH: Are you coming?
         I gonna come!
            Typical.
      JOSH: Jesus Christ!
   Ah! God, I love this song!
       I'm gonna love it
          forever now.
    This is not what I want.
         Join the club.
           [knocking]
           Who is it?
               Hi.
              Hi.
  You didn't answer my texts.
  Holly, this is stupid. I'm--
          I love you.
        I'm sorry, Rob.
 You know this won't work out.
          That's a...
 I don't know why you say that.
          Yes, you do.
      I had to come here.
     I had to speak to you.
       I know I didn't do
    everything I should've,
  but I'm a different person.
       Believe it or not,
         I'm happy now.
           I'm sorry.
      It wasn't you, Rob.
       It was never you.
     Are you gonna be okay?
             Yeah.
