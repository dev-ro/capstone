- Hi, Dougnastix!
- Hi, Asterix, Obelix! On a hunt?
Right!
It is necessary to kill a wild boar by a dinner!
What are you doing? You have lost your mind, Obelix!
You bring down trees while I'm on a trace!
Well you know how Getafix does not love
when you bring down trees!
Tree? What tree?
- This tree.
- What?
- Ah, that tree? I always said that in forest one can
break a leg! Everywhere these trees!
I'm leaving!
Wild boars are there!
Where? Ah, wild boars...
I nearly have forgotten about them!
Let's go!
Silence. Look.
Here's our dinner!
Rome
Gifts from the distant country, Egypt
for allmighty Caesar!
Gifts from mountain tops of Switzerland
for allmighty Caesar!
Excellent.
Allmighty Caesar! Imortal ruller!
Do not worry, we shall note your triumph
with magnificent representation!
You just look,
the gifts will arive from the whole empire!
In the beginning of ceremony to arena will arrive
the hundreds of slaves!
And everybody will bow their heads before You!
- Gaius Flavius!
- Yes, Caesar!
I want a gripping show,
worthy of my victories!
In other words, the best
representation in the world in the name of our Caesar!
I named you the main organiser!
And if you will succeed, I shall make you
the richest person in Rome!
But if it happens otherwise,
you will become the main act of the program!
I shall throw you to the lions!
Your destiny is in your own hands,
Gaius Flavius! Good luck!
Thank You, great Caesar!
Whant an honor!
You have told to me, that we have received gifts
from all provinces?
Oh, yes, Caesar!
Thousands, millions!
From every single province?
From every province, yes.
From every place?
Yes, Caesar. Yes, from all.
All, all, all places. Almost.
Almost.
All is quiet, private?
Natives do not rebel?
All is quies, Centurion.
No rebelions.
That is wnat I like. Peace.
There's our chance! It is necessary to strike suddenly
on gauls and to break them! I convoke all!
Hey, private! Are you here a newcomer?
I have just arrived in last groupe!
Do not attack these awful gauls
with no reason! It is too dangerous, you silly!
Yes?
Listen, from all countries which has conquered
Great Caesar, Gallia is the most rebellious.
And from all villages in Gallia this is
the most awful.
Wouldn't cross with even one leg into this village. There live
bloodthirsty predators, awful monsters.
Viscious beasts, without anything human in them.
They are like wild animals.
So, I have warned you.
- Here is the present hunt, Obelix.
- Yes, anything.
Well, you bear wild boars?
Certainly.
Here is the present dinner.
Right, Obelix?
Hey, what's up with you?
Nothing.
Yes, you are ill.
Hardly true.
Great druid Geatafix.
I wanted to say...
I worry.
Obelix, apparently, is ill. Before him lies
the tray with roasted wild boar, and he does not eat.
- Did he eat something earlier?
- Two wild boars.
For him it's nothing.
Let's go-we shall take a look.
Good day, great druid Getafix.
Greetings, Panacea.
Greetings.
And who is it?
That?
Look, here he is.
Strange, earlier he could not live without wild boars,
and now he does not eat them at all.
Obelix, what are you doing?
I bear obelisk.
Wait, you don't have obelisk.
Yes? Interesting, no obelisk.
No.
Panacea! Approach here, child!
It is Panacea, the niece of the leader.
She has just returned from her studies in Paris.
You remember, Asterix?
- I'm glad to meet you once again.
- Greetings.
- I'm glad to meet you again.
- Greetings. I don't know you.
You left as a small girl. With such pigtails, as in Obelix.
- You remember him, by the way?
- Certainly, I remember.
He fell into the barell of magic potion
when he was a kid.
Greetings. Obelix.
I, I, I...
I, I, I...
I'm glad to see you. Well, see you later.
I, I, I...
I'm also glad to see youm Panacea.
Why are you two laughing?
Obelix, my friend, you are in love.
Yes? Really?
Does Dogmatix like that or not?
I am afraid, it is a heavy case.
My Potion can't help there.
You want a peace of advice?
If you like Panacea...
I can't
Why won't you talk with her?
Why do you interfere?
I can't.
Greetings, Obelix. How did you sleep?
Are you still thinking of Panacea?
She is beautiful.
No doubt, beautiful.
And kind too.
Go and visit her, give her a present.
Great idea!
Oh, no, Obelix! No!
What is it?
You want to give her that?
That is the biggest piece of obelisk.
That's not a thing to give to a girl.
No?
No. Bettet to give her flowers.
Flowers? Great idea!
Be cautious, do not run into trees!
Silly, silly?!
They know who here is silly!
That is my problem, that I am so modest
and irresolute.
Surrender, the gaul, you are my prisoner!
You have been told.
You-stupid dork.
Loves me, loves me not.
Loves me, loves me not.
Loves me, loves me not.
No, no, no, you give.
I can't, can't.
All right. Panacea!
Quiet, she'll listen to you.
Panacea, my friend has brought something for you.
Oh, how sweet!
My favourite flowers.
Well, at last!
Panacea! Well, at last!
- I've waited for so long!
- We are again together!
- I shall not release you!
- And I too!
Oh, pigeons in love.
Hear nothing.
It is great that Tragicomix has returned.
They will soon get married.
What is with you, Obelix?
I am afraid, he has fallen in love.
With Panacea? Poor creature, Obelix,
you don't have the slightest chance.
Trust me on that.
I don't speak to you, dorks!
- Private, this gaul, is he an athlete?
- No, Decurion.
Is he wild?
No, Decurion.
Then it is my chance!
Perhaps, last in a life.
Stay behind!
Forward, forward, forward!
- Do not approach!
- You will be mine, the gaul!
Grab!
Help me!
Great, we grabbed him! Tie him up!
What is it? What do you have there?
It's Panacea's ribon.
Something is wrong. We must find them.
Druid Getafix, apparently,
the romans are about to attack the village.
I must prepare magic potion just in case.
Gaul and his girl.
You wished to make good impression,
Decurion?. Well, soldier, that now you can.
I wanted to make You happy!
I never shall forget you.
You will far go, I promise.
Yes!
To the most distant post of an overseas foreign legion!
Really, to Condatum?
Really, to Condatum!
And captives you will take away with yourself!
- You don't need them?
- I don't have any need of them even for money!
If I leave them here, the other gauls will tear
everything down in effort to bring them back.
And if I release them, they will revenge.
By Jupiter,
I need to get rid of them, and of you too!
Something does not suffice.
Great druid Getafix!
The romans have captured Panacea!
Well, again. Go collect people.
Now it's good.
Rise in turn!
Have you noticed, today I did not ask
for the magic potion? No, no.
In fact I already know, that if I ask for it...
...that you will tell me again how
I fell into it when I was a kid.
So give, spill. All the same to me.
Gauls, forward! We shall rescue them!
Only it is not necessary to swear!
Don't push me! I want to be heard!
Depart, I shall show them!
Gauls, gauls, gauls!
Gauls are attacking!
Let me, I also want to beat romans!
Do not worry, we'll get them all!
Arrange cohorts in three rows!
In three rows arranged!
Legionares, spears out!
Spears out!
Ah you, gauls, prepare the fists!
Stand still and that will be worse!
There was a month of fog, I have taken a knife
out of a pocket.
Obelix, may I?
Great. Like this?
Yes.
Came, seen and played.
Gaul, I am ready to admit my defeat
and give my life to you.
Romans know how to die. Take a sword
and allow me to leave with honour.
You what, have gone mad? I am going to pull your ears!
I aks you for the last time -
where are the captives?
They have been taken to the most distant post
of the overseas legion.
Obelix, we have to go!
- Yes, yes, I'm coming!
- To the most distant post of the overseas legion!
- I am free?
- Yes, free.
Friends, neighbours, gauls,
All village counts on you!
We understand what responsibility
lays on you!
Here, this is your stock of magic potion,
Asterix.
Protect it, you will need it
on your long journey.
Who knows what dangers wait for you there!
It is in Latin.
- Means: "The die has been cast".
Condatum.
It is necessary to learn, where there is their headquaters.
I shall ask the first Roman soldier we meet.
Dogmatix!
- Left, straight! Left, straight!
- Let's stop the patrol and ask.
- Perfect!
- Hey, Obelix, I didn't have that in mind!
Too late.
- It was necessary just to stop them.
- And now they don't move.
It is necessary to be polite sometimes.
Sir, would you be so kind, as to tell us
where there is the headquaters.
- The third turn to the right.
- Many thanks, sir.
Here you see, it is necessary to be polite
always and everywhere.
Wait here.
I won't let in Gauls. If you wish to enter
the army - wait in line.
I simply wish to ask something.
- Wait in the line, I've told you!
- I'm in a hurry!
Then give up!
So it is better.
I do not understand, in what does Asterix's politeness
differ from mine?
- Please tell me, where is a department of the information?
- I do not know. The information is in a department of the information.
Aha, here it is.
Strange, who needs the information?
Well, come on, you'll dreak down the door!
As you wish!
Nobody here?
Ah, you are here!
I'm in a need of one information. I'm looking for a legionare
Tragicomix. You have enlisted him.
It is a secret information.
I can not give it to you.
Why?
Because it does not concern
impudent gauls, such as yourself.
Last time I ask-
Where now is Tragicomix?
Give him a copy of orders on a march.
Quickly!
- Orders on a march, sir.
- Many thanks.
Here, that means to be polite.
Obelix! Obelix!
I'm going!
Stop! To the line, like all the others!
Hey, Asterix! The Roman with whom you were
is extremely polite, very polite with me too!
What do you think, can be I with him
very polite?
Certainly!
Lift a chin, I shall show you how
cultural and polite I can be.
Tragicomix and Panacea have been taken to Africa.
We can get there, we just need to enter
the Roman legion, and immediately.
- Read.
- Latin, Greek, it's all the same to me.
It's us again!!!
Well, here you are gathered, young volunteers,
so wellcome.
So if you please, I'm your humble instructor
Dubious Otatus.
What a wonderful idea - to fight for romans.
And now I ask you to follow me here, gentlemen, here.
That's it.
Now I present you Hakuswriteus,
who will enlist you all.
- What is he saying?
- It doesn't matter, we are in a hurry.
- Come on. What is your name?
- Constantlywithoutworx. I'm from Londonium.
- Next.
- I'm from Iberia. Pedros Gonsales.
How do you spell it?
Just write down "Ole!", or else we'll spend
the whole day writting it down.
And finaly, there are two gauls.
Asterix and Obelix! Move that hammer faster,
we are wasting time!
Soldier Opaella needs a fish
or a chicken.
Well here we are in the army.
Silece! No jokes!
Now you are in the army!
- I was speaking.
- Back in line! A step back!
- I shall make the soldiers out of you!
- Should I be polite with him as well?
- No, it is not necessary yet.
- Silence!
- What did he say?
- What did he say?
- What did he say?
- What did he say?
He wants to know what did You say.
I said - silence!
- What did he say?
- Silence!
Silence!!!
All right, let's all calm down. So, what was I saying?
I have forgotten everything. So, he has asked me and I have told him that.
- It is possible to ask a question?
- What?
About the money. How much is legionare payed per day?
- One sestecia.
- Ah, my God, it is impossible!
- Two!
- No, one!
- Two!
- One!
- Two!
- One!
- Two!
- One!
Uno, dos, tres! Uno, dos, tres!
Uno, dos, tres! Viva, viva, viva, Espagnia! Ole!
Hey, roman, when will we proceed?
When we'll start training?
- What is it?
- Lunch!
- Soup!
- Soup!
- Soup!
- Great idea, my belly is already empty.
Yes, I also think that mine is empty.
So, Decurion Doubious Otatus, this is how you
brng regruits into shape.
What did Decurion told us, soup is bad?
You know that, I think, I've fallen in love.
Yes, I've fallen in love.
Eat! Eat! Eat!
Asterix, and to us they will give a wild boar, right?
Yes, stronger the army, worse meals.
They do that intentionally,
so that the soldiers eould be more malicious.
Thus, the Roman army is the strongest in the world.
That is interesting, what have you put in there?
Soup of the legionary.
Weat, old stale cheese, wild nuts -
all mixed and cooked together to save time.
- And every day like that?
- No. Double ration for Easter.
This is impossible to eat it! What a nasty thing!
Excellent.
Wonderful.
Superb.
Hey, are you the guy who prepare
meal for everybody?
- Yes, why?
- Why?! Those are slops!
If you wish so, you may irder your favourite meal...
Certainly. I would order a wild boar.
I see, You have rather refine taste.
Or, as they say, your taste in food is very delicate.
That's right! Great that you have understood us, cook.
Get out of my kitchen, or I'll throw you out
into the furnace!
Asterix, may I be polite with him?
It seems, my friend, that he did not
present us with other choice.
The main thing is- do not twist your head.
Listen, cook, each time when you don't prepare us our meal,
we shall come back.
Soupslopius, are they gone?
Yes, gone.
Quickly find somewhere
wild boars, partridges, a salmon...
...and fresh cream.
I understand boss.
And before you leave, make fire
a bit less.
You are enlisted in the first legion, the third
cohort, the second manipulus, in the first centurio!
You must report to the commanders!
The dwarf, report!
- Asterix from Galia.
- I'm Obelix, and what is your name?
Decurion Dubious Otatus, the first legion,
the third cohort! You two, back in line!
Silence!
So, now spear throwing! Try
to hit the target, legionare Obeliks!
Come on!
Oh! Well, I did everything that I could!
It's not so simple to find a wild boar!
And now I shall teach you to fight
with the sword!
Since you are new, they are made of wood!
So, begin! Begin! Guard yourself!
- Why is it made of wood?
- Do as he tells you to! We should not waste the time!
- Guard yourself!
- As you say!
Decurion, I shall not eat this soup,
it tastes like spoiled!
Legionares, your training is over!
Tomorrow in the morning you will go to Masilia,
from where will ship take you to Africa!
It was about time.
- I should gather my things.
- I hope they will not forget to bring the cook.
All of you are soldiers of my army
and will soon battle as romans!
- As romans?
- Yes, and romans!
Like those romans?! Ha-ha-ha!
So, as you were! All to sleep!
Tomorrow in 5 in the morning we begin a campaign!
A bunch of pityful barbarians!
Now they are not so ridiculous to you, right?
Left, right! Left, right!
March forward ifor the glory of Rome!
I' wathing for those who lag behind me!
After me, Decurion Dubious Otatus!
There's still a long way ahead of us!
In the name of a beard of the druid, look
those lagging behind.
One drink - and I shall carry entire cohort.
Today we spend the night here.
Halt!
With this rate we shall reach
Masilia in 4 days.
- You think, it will be easy to find them?
- Certainly, easily.
Here is Masilia, a silent small fishermen village.
Good. Good.
Everything will suffice. I do not wish to go any more.
I want to go home, to Rome.
Throw your things and pair up!
And it is possible for us to sit down together?
We very much in a hurry! Is everything ready?
Raise anchor!
Usually I speak - raise anchor!
Good by friends!
Centurion Gorilasgreatus!
I welcome you, Centurion Gorilasgreatus.
I'm at Your service.
Work, gaul!
Waitress, drink!
Hey, and to me a beer!
Has the wind damaged a fence?
Yes, when the wind blows,
nothing can resist it.
I also can't resist something.
No!
Your new waitress is very vivid.
Yes. She's our new gaul.
Girl from Galia! Ah, Paris!
Can she speak to me on Franch or Latin?
Move your hands! Help!
Leave me! Let me go!
You - hideous beast! Leave! Go away!
- Panacea, here!
- Stop them! Guards!
Stop! Stop!
Where they're going there's nothing
but the sand and the sun.
The desert will become their tomb.
Here are the new reinforcements.
I've brought them here, Centurion Gorilasgreatus.
Dubious Otatus, you have carried out the order.
I am pleased with you.
Send newcomers to fix the fence, it is necessary
to close up a gap before the wind rises.
Lift!
My helmet!
That is necessary. There are many romans here.
Don't beat them, Obelix. They are our friends now.
- Romans - our friends?
- Right, since we are the romans now.
So, you mean, we are now friends of our enemies?
- Explain it to me.
- We have no time for that. Let's help him.
Now nobody can get out of here.
Those two which ran into the desert
may be considered dead.
- Which two?
- The guy and the girl. Both gauls.
- Ran into the desert.
- Tragicomics and Panacea?
- You didn't know about that?
- Now we know! There's no point in us staying here anymore!
Deserters! Guards! Guards!
- Are we all still friends?
- No, now we are enemies.
- Us and the romans?
- Now we are. Do you understand?
And now, open the door, Obelix!
May I ask why we had to close them before?
Not many caravans pass through here.
You were fortunate that we have found you here.
We will take you to Zi.
- And why are we tied up?
- It's so you wouldn't fell off cammel.
- Who are you? Merchants?
Yes, merchants. To be precise - slave traders.
Romans will pay a great sum of money for you.
You are a collection items - two beloveds.
Slaves on sale! Approach and choose!
The guaranteed quality!
Vikings from fjords in excellent
condition!
Second-hand slaves under a special price!
Slaves for all occasions!
- With 6 months guarantee! All are healthy!
- Is he in a good condition?
Been in slavery for only 10 years, belonged
to one old woman, helped her to knit!
No, he's not for me. To me it is necessary to aquire a
brawny macho slave for circus Maksimus.
Hasan, you, like,
trade with africans?
They have arived from Africa, but they are gauls.
So, the girl does not interest me,
but the guy is strong.
- Well, how much is he?
- I sell them both to you for 3.000.
3.000 is too much.
But for that sum you receive great goods!
They have lived on surburb of Gallia, in Armorica!
In Armorica? Yes, Hasan.
And your stand is not as wide as usual, eh, Hasan?
Imagine what the prefect of Rome would say about that.
You will not be allowed to trade anymore.
Why sould I argue with my old friend?
2.000! Do we agree now?
Certanly, my friend.
Usually for this kind of slaves you need to have a licence.
Have you been asked for it on customs?
Yes. Only one thousand.
Is it possible in cash?
And the regulal taxes, brother,
have they been payed?
500, Gaius Flavius.
Yes, and still. And you filed all payment
taxes?
It would be a great honor for me
to give them to you...
... as a sign on the infinite gratitude
and respect for You, oh, great roman!
Well, I couldn't take them as a present, I cannot.
But since you insist, I shall not upset you.
It is necessary to transport the goods. Come on.
You see, it is always possible to agree.
It is just necessary to be able to bargain.
Look!
Caravan!
There are more and more people in the desert.
- Where are you from?
- From Galia.
- You as well?
- What do you mean by that?
I have just sold, that is I have given a ride to a
couple from Gallia to Zi.
- Would you take us as well?
- Of course!
- However, we have absolutely no money.
It's a free-of-charge service.
No, no, the buyer will pay me.
Catch them! Quickly!
Asterix, are they our friends?
- No, I wouldn't say so.
- Good.
Asterix, since now we are not romans,
where do we go?
- To Rome.
- To Rome?
Yes. There they sold Tragicomix and Panacea
to slavery.
Well, Gaius Flavius, when will
my triumph be finished?
Coloseum will be ready, Caesar.
- What is in the program?
- About that, it'll be amazing!
We will set free 10.000 pigeons...
... then the chariot race will begin and
the best equestrians will delight crowd.
After that, in arena will enter the gladiators.
Oh, great Caesar, have You known
that such people are but a few in the world.
Giants. Strong as bears.
Quick as foxes.
After them, in front of You will pass the slaves
representing every country of Your empire.
- No exeption?
- No. Finally, Caesar.
Even the rebellious gauls, presenting gauls
will bow to You on circus sand.
- Never!
- Hey, how dare you?
Caesar, do not pay attention.
No, as the son of the valorous leader
I do not recognize myself as the slave!
And he is insolent, your young gaul.
- Yes obey gaul!
- No, Gaius, he is right.
I will personally see to it that he is treated
in acording to his status.
Put him in solitary!
No, we will not be separated!
Girl was wrong to speak like that.
Pardon her, Caesar.
- I'd rather die!
- Die?
If that is what you wish,
there's nothing simplier.
Put them both in Colise prison,
and then throw them to the lions!
My cats have a great apetite,
you'll see that yourself.
Well, is that Rome?
Yes, Obelix, we've arrived.
- What shall we eat?
- There must be somewhere a slave market.
Hasan Ven Leader,
You sell the slaves from Africa?
Yes, I've sold two of them.
Right, to whome did you sell those two gauls?
- You require the information?
- Well, that's going to cost you.
Obelix.
Just 500.
Alright, 100.
Ok, I'll tell you all for free.
- Do you want more?
- No.
He is called Gaius Flavius, he's tall, large man.
You'll recognize him with no problem.
He always dreses in red, he has a white toga,
and often goes to the pool.
Many thanks, Hasan Ven Veader.
That's it.
As my parents used to say, agreements are always possible,
one just needs to know how to trade.
Respectable citizen,
Would you wish to undress?
- Is he our friend?
- Yes, friend. Do as he says.
We're in so few clothes.
I hope we shall not catch a cold.
- You can't get in, shorty!
- How dare you speak to him like that?
I haven't spoken to you, fatty.
Asterix, as I see it, he's not our friend.
- I'm afraid he's not.
- Good.
Anyway, I can't see anyone wearing a white toga.
There's nothing for us to do here. Let's go.
Magnificent. That man is just
born to become gladiator.
What?
Wait, I need to fresh up.
Look, Asterix, I'll dive.
I need him.
I must have him.
There's no more water in the pool.
By a beard of the druid,
you are detaining us.
Alright, alright, alright.
I'm going, I'm going.
I need those two.
- And what about the dwarf?
- He, too, is necessary. He's the leader.
Well, come to me, my little poet.
Well, do you feel my lovely Dogmatix.
We must find Gaius Flavius, since he knows where our friends are.
Let's go.
All is well, my beloved.
Do not worry, pappa is with you.
Move, Obelix, we have stayed hare for too long already.
Hurry up, Obelix!
Mister Asterix, I have the right to speak
to Dogmatix whenever I want.
Mister Obelix, we have no time!
If you don't stop shouting, you will frighten
little Dogmatix. Calm down.
I'm calm!
Me too. Very calm!
- Do you know Gaius Flavius?
- Certanly. Very well.
He has the school for gladiators and
he's very interested in You. Grab him!
Oh, my magic potion!
Asterix is always yelling at me,
I don't know why.
Well, let's go, Dogmatix.
It works, just not always.
Interesting. Where did Asterix go?
I'm suddenly tired.
Asterix!
Is there anybody here?
No, we are closed.
Asterix!
Asterix!
Asterix!
Where are you?
Wait. Look, there's the second gaul.
It is necessary to catch it. Go after him.
- Where will you go?
- I'll cover you.
Where is Asterix?
Get him!
Asterix!
Asterix!
Dogmatix!
Wait! Where are you going?
Come to me, my little poet!
Obelix!
Asterix!
Asterix!
Asterix!
Obelix! Obelix!
Asterix!
Asterix!
Obelix!
Obelix! Obelix!
It's me!
Obelix! Obelix!
Asterix! Asterix!
Well done, well done! Obelix,
it's fortunate for me, that you have appeared in time.
But, unfortunately, I have lost magic
potion.
And I have lost Dogmatix, he ran away.
What is that singing in Coloseum?
The slave from Gallia every night
sings the same song.
- From Galia, you say?
- Yes.
On the day of Caesar's triumph
she will be cast to the lions.
- And I'm without a magic potion.
- What did you say?
I said - I'd love to get into the circus to take a look.
Yes, but it's well protected everywhere. they let in only those,
who are doomed to death - lions and gladiators.
We'll get in!
We'll become gladiators!
You dishonour honour of school Kaja Flavija!
We need strond men instead of prima-donnas!
There you go! So much more lively! Beat it strongly!
Strongly! You are too slow!
It is not necessary to walk around in cicles!
Hold that sword harder! Hold that sword harder!
That is not a bouquet of flowers!
You are the gladiators, not dancers!
You are just hopless! None of you have any talent!
That big gaul - that's what I need
for this presentation!
He should be the main gladiator for Caesar,
since you all are just a bunch of freeloaders!
I don't care how, just find them!
Put in the search all of the army!
I need them today, do you understand?
Bring them to me! Quickly! Leave now!
You too! Stop irritating me with that coin!
Are you Gaius Flavius?
Who, you? Ah, me. Yes. No.
Are you Gaius Flavius?
Yes. That is, no. Not quite. But I used to be him.
We want to become gladiators.
Gladiators?
You want to become gladiators?
In that case, I am Gaius Flavius.
Than again, becoming a gladiator is not easy,
but I'm willing to help you.
- Only make it fast, we are in a hurry.
- Strongly, weaklings! Even strongly!
Dubious Otatus, I have a two candidates here,
take a look at them!
So, you want to become gladiators?
Well, I shall send you to a trainer.
He is the strictes trainer I've ever seen.
Where are those two puppies?
No! Forgive me! Forgive me!
Don't do that to me, Gaius! I do not wish to die!
My God, just not that!
I cannot, I can not, I can not, I can not!
We want to become gladiators.
Teach us.
Gladiators, we have two beginners!
Children, give them a good lesson!
Everything it finished. Good bye, Gaius.
Where are you going?
I wish my pension to be sent to my mother.
Circus Coloseum: For the first time on arena
gladiators Asterix and Obelix.
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!
Caesar, this is our triumph.
That is, I ment, Your triumph, Caesar.
You have magnificently presented Rome.
With all my humbleness I recieve those complements.
I hope everything goes well, or else, as I've already said,
you will be the main act.
Let the games begin!
Let the games begin!
From the farthest provinces of the empire!
Brits, gotts, egiptians, liberians!
The slaves from all conquered countriesbow their head
in the presence of the great Caesar on the sand of the arena!
From all corners of the world,
dressed in animal skins!
The greatest presentation on earth!
All roads lead to Rome,
and today everything is here!
Help me, Lord, give me streinght,
my throat is as dry as Sahara desert.
As a highlight of our programme, straight from Galia,
come the barabarians...
...which wouldn't submit to our great emperor Caesar!
In the end of this presentation they will be thrown
to hungry to lions!
The emperor, allmighty and infinitely
generous...
...has alowed them to protect themselves
with their bare hands!
You are too kind, Caesar.
I know, Gaius. Great Caesar
is mercyfull to the fallen.
And here comes the moment all of you have
been waiting for! Here it is, chariots race!
A gift from our immortal emperor to
romans and fellow citizens!
Where is that gaul, who until now
rode that chariot?
- Mekanix? I dunno.
- How are we gonna race without him?
That's no problem.
- Really?
- Yes, if you need a gaul, that is.
Death or glory!
Circus Maximus!
I will hold the ribbon,
you take care of the competition.
Two men in a chariot with four horses?!
What mockery is this?
Now, this is a race!
Faster, faster! Come on, come on!
Go, go!
This is the last round! Thi...
By Mercury, if anyone touchs me,
he's receive a whip!
He won't let us pass, stop him!
Come on!
- Let go, you idiot!
- As you wish!
- Ave, Caesar!
- Thank you, Gaius.
And you, get back down there, you coward!
Your place is in the arena!
I have warned you, Gaius!
Your place is also in the arena!
No, no. Please.
The winner of great chariots race-
Gaul Asteriks!
And now the stars of today
gala presentation will act for Caesar!
The greatest gladiators of roman history!
They have been trained in the school of gladiatorial
and fighting arts of Gaius Flavius!
The special event! In honour of Your triumph,
great Caesar! Your circus Maksimus!
It is my great privilege to present to you this group.
Among them are two extraordinary men.
Those two gauls are the best fighters.
Ave, Caesar! We, who are about to die,
salute you!
Hi, Julius! What's up?
They have all those bad gallic habits,
it's in their blood.
But here they are fighting with masters.
They are the bonebreakers. It is necessary for them to be rude.
Asterix, thaose men, are they our friends?
No, they are not our friends, Obelix.
I don't understand. In Galia they were our enemies,
in Africa they've become our friends.
Can Julius explain it to me?
Oh, Caesar, I'll set the lions on them,
and it'll all be over in a second.
Where is Merlin? I want to know where is he!
Pomniboss, bring me the amphore!
The truth lies in the vine!
I have the Sahara desert in my throat!
When will you bring...
And now, dear spectators, came
so much prolonged moment!
Sacrifice in the name of Jupiter!
Greater kitties have gotten hungry,
Caesar.
Since thay have been caught, they have received
one yoghurt and a slice of a toast per day.
- Obelix, Asterix!
Magic potion! We are saved!
Magic potion, magic potion...
Are you able to fight, Obelix?
You know me. If my little poet is not with me...
Here they come! The greatest, the most viscious,
furious, horrible...
...terrible, the most frightening beasts on earth!
Look at them!
Dogmatix, my friend!
My magic potion!
My little Dogmatix!
Tragicomix, catch!
Lions, lions, lions, and all mine!
You said it right, Gaius.
The programme was extraordinary.
No one in Rome has ever seen one like it.
Mercy, Caesar! Why don't you release
those two brave soldiers?
Mercy of Caesar has no boundaries!
Almost.
Oh, no. No, no.
Gauls, you are free.
Listen!
Caesar's triumph has appeared to be our triumph,
Triumph of all Gallia divided into 3 parts!
I thank the emperor personally...
- Oh, Obelix.
- Have you seen them, they are such heroes.
And Obelix tore down the Coloseum.
