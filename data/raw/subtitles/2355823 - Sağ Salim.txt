In the name of God the merciful...
Pour, pour some more...
Poor old Salim.
Were we to see you like
this, so young...
That's so true...
I don't know what
they wanted from him.
Pour some more...
Who shot him, uncle?
Has anyone seen orheard anything?
No. I guess it
was just one of those things...
Are we sending the body
to Sivas?
Sivas orhere, what
difference does it make?
He has no friends
orfamily...
Get a hold of him, let's turn him over.
In the name of God...
Let's turn him overthen.
Here, hold that.
- Cotton wool.
- Cotton wool?
- To stick up his ass.
- What?
- But Uncle, I am not dead!
- Hold that forme.
What are you doing to my ass?
Uncle...
- Uncle... - In the name of God the
Merciful. - I'm here, I'm not dead...
I'm not dead... I'm not dead!
I'm not dead!
I'm not dead!
- You fool! Are you dead?
- Let me check...
I'm not dead, thank God
I just fell asleep.
Get up! My daughterin law
is having a baby!
My God! Again?
My God! What a state!
Uncle Ramiz, I think

Aunt Mehtap, for Heaven's sake...
How many is it now?
Come on son get a move on!
Get us to hospital!
Ok, ok I'm coming!
God...
- Where's the steering wheel?
- At home.
ForGod's sake son... What is
the steering wheel doing at home!
Don't get mad, I'll get
it right now...
This caris my life, Uncle Ramiz.
I take the steering off at
night so they don't steal it.
Come along then!
Go slowly son are
you trying to kill us?
I can't stand it much longer!
Hang on in there Auntie
I'll get you there, don't worry.
I can't stand it!
This won't work, Uncle Ramiz.
I'm going to take a short cut.
- Heavens!
- Is this your short cut?
When did they put that there?
Uncle Ramiz... There is a lot of illegal
building going on in the area these days...
- You... Yourbuildings...
- Uncle please don't
...your driving wheel, your life...
- Uncle please don't!
Uncle Ramiz, happy news!
Look how I got herto give
birth, Uncle Ramiz!
My daughter... Good news!
Thank you, Father.
Thanks to you too, Salim...
Not at all, Aunt Mehtap.
You're always welcome!
Uncle!
Uncle!
Good day to you, Uncle.
And to you.
I'm a bit late, I do appologise.
Do you know Ramiz has had
another grandchild. A boy this time.
I made her
give birth!
Hang on son don't
go in there!
But don't you worry I'll drive like the
wind and get the cheese into town.
- There's a dead man in here! A dead man!
- Stop it for a second!
Hang on son, don't be scared.
Don't be scared now.
Don't be scared. Don't.
I had him put there.
- You had him put there?
- Yes.
Is this a joke?
This was not our deal!
Look Cafer. I'm not joking.
I need that money.
Tell me when they're
bringing it.
Please don't bro...
They'll kill us both bro.
Stop calling me bro!
You dog!
If I say "tell me", "tell me".
When are they bringing the money?
Today bro.
At what time?
- Around two bro.
- How many people?
- Just the one.
- Don't lie to me!
One person for all
that money!
I swear, it's just one guy.
So they don't draw attention.
I beg of you don't bro.
If Gucur finds you...
He won't give you to the cops.
You'll never get out of
this bro.
You're right.
Better not leave any clues.
The maniac shot his friend!
He shot his friend!
What's going on?
What...
Where are you going?
Biray!
When the heck did you
learn how to drive?
- Uncle.
- What?
Who is he?
Grandpa Cemil.
Who is Grandpa Cemil?
No one you'd know.
A poor soul.
Look here. He's from your
home town.
- From Sivas?
- Why, yes!
From where in Sivas?
Oh anyway. God rest
his soul.
I'm in the truck, tell
the boys to load herup!
Salim!
- That's the load.
- What!
Whatever next!
Uncle please stop it!
Don't you know I'm scared of
the dead? I'm scared!
Son, who isn't afraid of the dead?
Come over here.
Come over here.
Come... Stop it!
Don't do this to me!
Look here. Son. Salim.
This man is a poor old soul.
Abandoned.
Take him down to Sivas.
It's a very good deed.
Uncle... What am I, a herse?
What do I want with the dead?
Son, they were his dying words to me.
He even saved the money
forhis funeral.
Go away! Money forthe funeral?
It's none of my business!
What are you afraid of?
What are you afraid of?
You think he'll come alive again?
Don't be scared, don't be scared.
Things like that happen...
I didn't put enough cotton wool in.
Irfan what have you done?
I said make a coffin, not a canoe!
What do I know about coffins?
You said "make one" I did!
- Good for you!
- Uncle, look here.
Is there no one left to send?
Where am I going to find
someone all the way out here Salim?
Look uncle, if that man farts again
I'm going to die of fright.
I'll hit the truck!
I'll have an accident I swear!
Salim. It was his last will
and testament.
He said, if I die don't bury me here.
Send me back to my hometown.
He didn't say "make sure
Salim takes me" though.
Salim, come on, don't.
If you don't understand the situation
of the poor and the lonely who does?
Do you just want to leave him
all alone?
Let's not leave him...
So he has no one, no distant
relatives or such like...
He has a no good son. He followed
him all the way out here.
And when his time came...
There he was left, alone.
He has no one, too. Just like you.
Come on son.
Come on my lion!
Do a brave deed!
Don't leave him alone
like his son did.
Dear God have mercy, protect me.
Hello, Uncle?
What is it Salim?
Uncle when I go through
pot holes...
...the lid of the coffin slides off
further and further...
Well push it back then Salim.
Is this going to keep
opening all the way?
Salim... Son... You're going to make
me say things I'll regret.
Just take the body over and
let's both get rid of it!
Wierdo...
Uncle... Hello?
God forgive me...
God!
What are you doing?
I'm going to die...
I'm going to die today!
The coffin lid slid off.
I'm trying to close that.
Don't worry. I'll close it.
God bless you.
Look here...
What are you doing all
the way out there?
I'm going to Sivas,
I'm waiting for a car.
Swearto God!
I'm going to Sivas too!
- My lucky day is it?
- Yes indeed it is!
Good for you.
You weren't scared at all.
I'm not scared of the dead.
Did you know him?
Who?
The guy who passed.
Oh him. No, I don't.
Seems he was an old guy
with no family.
He told the headman of our village
on his deathbed.
Do whatever it takes but get
me back to my home town he said.
So I set on my way, to do
a good deed.
He was a lucky guy.
What do you mean lucky?
Turns out he had this good
for nothing son...
...he neverlooked in on him once.
What kind of a son is that?
If only my parents were alive...
...I would lie down at their feet.
Come on... Can't you
go straight?
What's up? I
hope you get well soon...
...are you sick?
No, these are to
get high with.
High?
It calms the brain.
Does it really work?
Yes it does.
You know, I'm a bit
tense too...
Thanks so much...
Thank you.
Is this the first time
you've carried a body?
You seem a little scared.
Why are you carrying some stranger?
Is the money good?
No, what money?
For God's sake is this
something you'd go through for money?
As I said, because it's a
good dead.
Besides, everyone's scared of the dead.
I'm not normally scared...
...I dreamt I was dead last night.
The headman of the village
was cleaning my corpse.
...they were just about to stuff
cotton wool into my as...
I almost didn't wake up.
Who am I talking to?
Salim on his own again!
- What is it woman? - Hello? Where are you?
- Don't keep calling, I'll loose my temper.
- Look, Halit dear.
- Look here.
- Has she called the house?
- No, no one.
I keep calling, the phone
rings but she doesn't answer.
- How can she, she's scared...
- Wait till I get my hands on her...
- Halit...
- I'm going to shoot her.
- I won't let her get away with it.
- What will you do when you find her?
Kill her?
- Will you have your own daughter's
blood on your hands? - Be quiet woman!
- It's all yourfault. - Halit...
- Send her to school you said.
- Yes let's.
- Let her have a job you said.
- Halit. - Let her stand
on her own feet you said.
What's wrong with her
standing on her own feet?
Look where she has
gone on those feet!
- You made the girl a whore!
- Don't you call my daughter a whore!
- Don't call her a whore! Halit I beg of you
don't do anything to her! - Be quiet!
She has made me a laughing stock!
- My word has been made light of!
- Halit...
But I will find her...
I will cleanse my name!
- This is not honor... 
- Don't cry woman don't cry!
Don't cry forthat whore!
You're making me loose my temper.
Don't call my daughter a whore!
ForGod's sake...
I'm so hot...
But... What the...
What the hell are you doing?
We're going to die!
- Hit the breaks! Hit the breaks!
- The steering wheel, the steering wheel!
Hit the breaks!
What the fuck?!
You idiot! There was a
man in front of the car!
A man?!
What man?
What the fuck are you doing?
How can you sleep at the
wheel?
What should I do?
I dozed off?
You dozed off?
You were snoring!
It was because of your pills!
One won't hurt you.
Maybe, but I took two.
My God! I'm a murderer.
My God I'm a murderer!
Oh God...
He's there on the ground.
The man flew!
What?
The man infront of the car. He must
have flown over when we hit him.
Do you think he's dead?
Of course he is! Could anyone
survive such a fall?
God knows how you hit him...
You? We hit him!
You were holding the wheel, too!
We hit him together.
Shut up!
Where we stepping on the breaks
together aswell?
I couldn't stop.
I hit the breaks. But I
couldn't stop.
My God!
Come on stupid machine!
What's this smoke?
Am I on fire?
What?
No, no, no, come on
that can't be smoke.
It's not going!
I'm on fire! I'm on fire!
I'm on fire! It's going to explode!
It's going to explode!
What have I done to it?
I was driving it so nicely.
Mad man!
It's Ayhan's car after all...
Dear Lord, you know I didn't
mean to kill him!
What's done is done.
Stop that crying and grab
a hold of his feet.
God! Of who's feet?
Come on, let's carry this guy.
Brother. I can't hold dead people.
They make me sick.
Look here brother...
Thank God I'm helping you.
Either you come down and hold him
orl'll leave you here.
Couldn't we just leave him here?
Besides who would know
that we did it?
There are tire tracks in the road.
The caris there, too.
With the dent in the back.
What if someone saw?
Aynur...
Aynur your legs are slipping...
Aynur used to write on her legs
before exams, to cheat.
When she looked at it, she pulled 
her skirt right up to herpanties...
Think of Aynur's white panties.
What the hell are you doing?
Now you've got his feet, will you put
them on your shoulders?
No brother. I must think of something else.
Or else I'll faint.
Think of Aynur's legs.
Think of Aynur's white panties.
Think of Aynur.
Think of Aynur.
Think of Aynur's legs.
- Come closer! - Think of Aynur.
- Make sure noone sees.
Ok, put him down like that.
My God what is happening to me!
My God what is happening?
We have to separate the corpse and the car.
We'll take the body with us
and toss it out somewhere ahead.
Once we push the car down that
hill, we're alright.
I'm talking to you!
Isn't it a sin?
Isn't what we're doing a sin?
We can ask the police
to come over if you like.
It's all the same to me.
You killed a man in broad daylight
in an empty road.
You'll get a good couple of years
let me tell you.
So? Are we calling the cops
or pushing the car?
We're pushing the car.
Get behind the wheel.
Come on, come on!
Fuck!
What happened?
- There's another body here!
- What?
My God!
We killed him too!
My God...
There was one, now there are
two, what shall we do Lord?
Help us!
We didn't kill this one.
Swear to God?
Maybe we didn't kill this one
either?
This one's shot.
What? They did what?
- They shot him, shot him.
- They shot him, shot him.
- Come overhere! - What?
- Catch a hold of him. - Again?
Come on!
Think of Mine.
She was a small girl with short hair.
But she had a huge ass.
Her name was Emine but she
liked to be called Mine. Think of Mine.
What a little perve
you turned out to be!
You've spent yourlife collecting material.
Pick your end up, come on!
What can I do, I have to think of
something else!
God. Merciful God...
What will we do with the other gentleman?
We'll throw him in the river,
he'll be washed away.
My God! Throw one to the lake,
the other somewhere else...
These are great sins!
I am sure of it!
Think of Mine and her huge ass.
Think of Aynur's white panties.
- Come on, hold him! - What do you
mean hold him? Dear God, help us!
Do we just push him over?
- We push him over like this? - Yes.
- Ok, come on then.
- In the name of God the Merciful.
- Come on then.
One, two three, God help us!
How far can this go brother?
He'll float a bit and then sink.
Are you sure? He
seems to be floating to me?
We should have tied a stone to his foot.
Don't you worry. The river
will wash him away.
Come on, let's get the car
before someone comes over.
Fuck!
What the hell is this?
No way!
We should have thrown a few stones
at the deceased. He would sink too.
Brother, just shut up for one second!
You're fixated on stones!
Just do what I tell you to!
Will you stop scolding me?
Are these normal?
I don't know whether
I'm coming or going.
Come on!
Fuck!
Good deed they said!
Give me a hand!
Brother, you're going to be angry again
but I'm worried about something else.
We've chucked him in the water.
Why not the other one?
He's been shot, there's a bullet in
his body.
Get it? We'll get into trouble.
We hit this one. We'll drop him off
somewhere anyway.
Will we throw him in the
water again?
No, we'll shove him up my ass!
I've had enough of you!
I prayed. I swearto God
I prayed.
Fuck!
- The deceased's phone is ringing, 
should we answer? - And say what?
Maybe it's an emergency.
Come on, get into the car.
- Hello?
- Hello, Murat?
- We were worried, is everything alright?
- Yes sure, why shouldn't it be?
- I'm in a coffin, rolling along.
- In a coffin?
- A coffin? Are they burying you?
- No, not yet.
- I'm waiting for them to cotton wool in.
- Oh of course, the cotton wool.
Are you having a laugh?
- I nearly got caught! - What?
Don't ruin us now. - No, don't worry.
- I lost them don't worry.
- Ok.
- Ok I'll call you when I get there.
- Ok, bro.
Brother...
You know how we
threw him in the water...
What if we left fingerprints?
There's nothing to be done about it now.
What if the police find him
and ask questions?
- Ask what? - Why our fingerprints
are all over him?
You can say we fingered the corpse.
What if they ask how we
knew him?
We'll say we don't know him.
But bro...
Won't they ask me why I held
the feet of a man I don't know?
- There you go. - God.
- You're unlucky.
- Oh God...
- You can tell them yourself.
Smile. Calm down. I'll deal
with it, calm down.
God help us...
Good day to you, sir.
Look here, calm down or
you'll ruin both of us.
Who's in the back?
I don't know him. He died up on the
mountain, I'm taking him down to Sivas.
- Do you have his papers?
- Papers... Oh yes!
The headman of the village wrote it.
Sir, there are two
corpses here.
Now we're fucked...
You should have listed to
the teacherinstead...
...of staring at Aynur's
pants and Mine's ass.
Who's the second one?
I... I... I... Our... I...
- My, our...
- He's my relative sir.
- Yes, it's his relative.
- My condolences.
Bless your soul.
His death certificate?
The death certificate?
- He doesn't have one sir.
- No, he doesn't have one sir.
He died on the mountain. The headman said
you take him...
...straight down orthe body will smell.
While you're here maybe we can sort it
out sir, you'll be doing a good deed.
Yes, it is a good deed.
Go to the police station.
They'll help you out there.
And if we get stopped again?
You can say Commandar Alper
is aware of this.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
Did you see anything suspicious
on the way here?
No, we didn't.
We didn't hit anything...
I mean, we didn't see anything.
- We kept our eyes on the road.
- What is it sir, a terrorist?
No, a drug trafficker.
A short man. If you see him
alert the police.
- Come on, quick. - I'm going to die.
- Come on!
- Come on, son!
- God! Sorry...
- Well aren't you comfortable?
- What?
Ever since you came to the car everything
has been going wrong! You're unlucky!
I save your ass and look what you
say in response!
My ass? We hit the man
because of you!
- We hit him? - Yeah!
- You hit him! - Get out of town!
Was I the one fast asleep at the wheel?
You gave me those pills!
Did I tell you to drink
stuff you know nothing about?
Dear Lord, please help me...
I have one guy in the back, the other
guy has my fingerprints on him.
I'm a murderer! I'm a murderer
and it's all your fault!
Look here...
- My God! My God!
- Eyes on the road, eyes on the road!
- God! My God!
- The bloody thing won't go in!
God! It's all your fault!
Don't stare at me!
- Why have we stopped?
- I feel sick.
I feel a little dizzy.
Lie down and sleep a little.
It will help.
Yes, that's a good idea.
- What about you? - I'm going to
take a walk, get some air.
Oh, good.
- And coveryourself with this. It's getting
chilly. - Oh, thanks a lot.
Where are you off to?
I need to relieve myself.
I'll be right back.
I don't know if you can hear me.
Or see me.
But look... I'm here for you.
I wish I could just drag you
out of that coffin.
Noone can escape death.
Even me.
Forgive me.
- What the?
- What are these?
Cain and Abel.
Who and who?
Cain and Abel.
Give them back.
Who are you?
- Give those back.
- I said who are you?
What are you doing with
those guns?
I'm a police officer.
But I always carry my
guns with me. Give them here.
Yeah right, you're a cop.
Don't lie to me!
If you were a policeman would you
dipose the body? Or trick the gendarmes?
Look here son...
I'm helping you because
you seem like a nice guy.
Don't make me regret it.
Give them here.
Stay back or I'll shoot.
Give them here! There's
going to be an accident!
- Come here!
- You come here!
What the fuck is going on?
Who are these people?
So he was alive?
He was alive.
I didn't hit him and kill him then.
No, but you shot him
and killed him though.
What are you doing?
Getting rid of the evidence.
DearGod...
What the hell are you doing?
Stop! Where are you going, stop!
Stop!
Do you think he came and
we didn't notice?
What's up with you? You've been
running to the bathroom all day.
Isn't that enough?
I seem to have a lot of gas.
You've got the squits, right?
I told you not to eat so much.
God!
God, I almost killed someone else!
What are you doing, girl?
What are you doing?
I'm in a very difficult situation,
will you take me?
Take you? Take you where?
Wherever, it's all the same to me.
You see, I've got somebody chasing me.
You have someone chasing you?
Look here my girl.
I don't want any more trouble. I don't
want any more, close the door!
Don't you have any conscience?
All my troubles started because of my
conscience! Close the door!
But I'm pregnant too.
Well it isn't mine! Dear God!
So, you're leaving a pregnant woman
on her own like this?
- You can't.
- What about the kid's father?
I can't call him because... Because
he broke up with me.
Call yourmother orfather?
- Don't you have anyone?
- No!
No, I have no parents. I have
no one! Don't you get it?
Will you take me or
won't you?
Get in.
Get in, come on.
- Get in!
- Ok.
Tahsin...
You go over to this side. And
leave the carrunning.
I go in. When I get out, we
run forit, ok?
- Ok.
- Come on then.
By the way...
...don't fart in the car.
I'll kill you.
Hands up!
- Don't you dare, I'll waste you!
- Ok brother, calm down...
Push it over.
Give me the bag.
What are you going to do with
the bag, it's only bills and invoices...
...take what you want from the till, it will
count as the price of our lives. Come on!
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Gucur Osman... Give me the bag!
Who the hell are you?
Where did you learn about this from?
That's my business. Besides, what
does it matter?
Give me the bag! Come on!
Look here. I'm going to find you before
you can spend a penny of that cash.
Yeah right.
This is money for contraband fuel. Who
will you call, the cops?
Gucur!
Hands up!
How much more are we supposed
to lift them?
Didn't I tell you to
wait in the car?
Take this, come on!
Come on, take it!
Wait, I'll be right there.
Brother?
Where are you going, get into
the car, come on!
What happened bro, did you fix it?
Was it easy at least?
- What's happening?
- Who's that?
Who the hell are you, you
thieving bastard?
Mommy!
A robberwas all we needed!
What's going on?
What are you guys after?
Tahsin! Tahsin!
Drive, drive, faster!
Tahsin!
Tahsin! Quick, drive, quickly!
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- It's me! It's me!
Idiot!
Drive!
This way son, this way!
- This way you fool!
- Run Recep, run!
- Stop, stop!
- Go, go, go!
Come back here you bastards!
Run, run!
I'm going to find you!
I'll find you!
If I don't find you and make you pay,
then I'm not Gucur Osman.
Recep, run to the car!
Run to the car!
Stop!
Stop, get these ropes off!
We're still tied!
You idiot!
Go faster!
- Ayhan!
- Yes, Ayhan!
Why did you run off and leave me?
Is this who you left me for?
Him? 
What has it got to do with him?
He was passing I hitched a ride, 
that's all.
Wait girl. 
What did you do with the car?
You just left it in the middle
of the road, didn't you?
The carhas something wrong with it.
Shame on you!
I rob places and risk my life for you
and you run away from me.
Is this youridea of justice?
What are you staring at?
Step on it!
I am! I have my foot to the floor.
Really? If you like I can try too?
Did you have to search for
this idiot?
I think calling me an idiot is
going too far.
She's carrying your child
and I'm carrying her.
I need to have some respect.
Respect? What are you
on about?
What kids?
You abandon the girl. Then ask
"What kid?". Put that down.
You told him you were pregant?
You're not?
- Shame on you!
- Shut up!
And step on it!
Idiot!
Bro... This would bring
the dead back to life.
Is there anybody here?
Hello?
Who is the owner of this car?
Tahsin, how much longer are you
going to drive the wrong way?
Pull over, you'll get us both killed!
Slowly! Slowly, slowly
slowly, slowly!
Good foryou.
Bro, I don't exactly get it. You took the
money from the guy, right?
- Yes. Then you thought it was me
and gave it to someone else, right?
I did.
But he didn't even look like me,
I don't know how you did that!
He was wearing a ski mask.
- Ski mask? 
- Why was he wearing a ski mask?
He was afterthe money too,
don't you get it Tahsin?
What a coincindence!
He must have got such a surprise!
Some idiot steals the money and
then gives it to him!
I swear to God, if you say one more word
I will bust you a second asshole!
I'll bust you a new asshole!
And he calls me an idiot!
Get out of the car! Quickly!
But why were you running away
from me?
I don't know... When all
that happened I got scared.
My precious girl...
My sweet, my baby.
Why are you afraid of me?
I'd die for you!
Look, I stole the money, just
like we planned.
We're going to get away from here
and that's it.
But first we have to get rid of that idiot.
What do you mean
"Get rid of him," Ayhan?
Yes Ayhan, what do you mean?
Ayhan, my brother.
He saw us both. What if
he goes to the police?
I really won't brother, I swear to God!
- Look, he says he won't...
- Stop that crying...
- Look at the road! 
- How can I, you're talking about me.
Don't get me angry!
We're having a private...
...conversation here,
keep your eyes on the road!
Orl'll put one in yourhead.
Just look at yourself!
You know, you men are all the same.
Anger and threats
at the smallest thing!
You, my father, look
at yourselves...
- What about me?
- Now you look here!
What are you doing talking like those
women on tv?
Are you mad?
Look here! Talk to me properly,
and don't call me mad!
What do you want from me?
You said you wanted to run away
we're running, what more?
I said that but I didn't want it
to be like this.
My God! I seem to have desparately
asked help from a snake!
Now I'm a snake, am I?
What, did it hurt your feelings?
Of course, you're not a snake,
you're a killer.
You killed Cafer
right infront of me!
I did it foryou!
I killed him foryou!
Forme?
I'm running away from one animal
I don't want to take on a second.
Don't you get me angry! I kill you both,
both you and him!
Go on, kill us then!
You asked forthis...
Not him, not him, kill me.
Kill me, I'm sick of it all!
What are you doing?
Are you nuts?
Come on, do it, pull the trigger!
Look here! Don't you drive me mad!
Look, you know me.
I'm feeling something.
I'll burn us all, myself and this truck!
And you can stop cying,
be a man for a change!
I'm doing it all for you!
Just for you!
I put myself in danger,
I commit robberies!
What an ungreatful broad
you turned out to be!
Broad! Shame on you!
Broad? You're an animal!
You're a bearthat's what you are!
Yes, I'm a bear. I'm a huge bear!
- You got a problem with that! 
- Drop dead and rid me of you, scumbag!
Shall I kill myself?
Is that what you want?
Yes, yes. Die, die die!
Where the hell are you? I have been
calling for the past two hours...
...why don't you check yourphones?
I'm at Mustafa's petrol station, come here
quickly! We've lost the bastards!
God damn the lot of you!
What the...
What the?
Are you making fun of me?
You bastards!
I'm going to destroy you all!
It has gone everywhere! There
goes my upholstery!
I need to clean the truck.
If the gendarmes see it like this...
Do you have a handkerchief or
something I can wipe with?
Here, use this.
What is this?
Never mind that, just use
that to wipe with.
- Will it work?
- I guess it will.
Look at that, it really works!
Impressive, it absorbed all the blood!
I should keep a few of
these in the truck.
Are you okay?
No. I'm not okay at all.
My family tried to marry me to
someone I didn't want.
He's a real animal.
My father owed the man money.
He sold me in return,
I knew Ayhan from the neighborhood.
I asked him to take me away
from here. He accepted.
I didn't run away with him
because I loved him.
And now I'm just sitting here like this.
Well look at that.
Who's this?
Who's this? Aynur with the
white panties or...
...Emine who calls her self
Mine with the big ass?
Bro?
What the...
What the heck is this?
Ayhan.
Fuck!
What the hell is this?
What have you done bro?
I swear I didn't do anything!
It's the road works fault.
At best I'm one eighth at fault.
What are you jabbering about?
Did you kill him?
Sort of...
Partly.
But I didn't mean to.
So was I the unlucky one?
Anyway. Why did you run away?
Please forgive me brother.
I got scared when I saw the guns.
I wouldn't have left you otherwise.
Was that the first time you've seen a gun?
Of course not! I'm just a bit tense.
And when I shot that guy afterwards...
What?
You shot someone?
Partly.
I mean, he was dead before.
Look bro. I'm very sorry.
I made a mistake.
Don't you do the same.
I can't get out of this alone.
You know about such things.
Help me! What am I going to
do now, help me!
Stop, stop.
My God, what am I going to do
there are dead people everywhere!
What am I going to do?
Are there any more canvasses?
Canvas?
Of course there are!
We can wrap up at least 10 more people!
- Hello!
- Hello?
- How are you doing? - I'm fine but
how about you, still in the coffin?
I'm going to get out but
I'm too scared!
These guys are psychopaths!
Not counting the guy
in the coffin...
...and he's my buddy to the death...
...until the day we die I mean...
...there are two more bodies
in the truck.
What are you saying?
And do you know what, 
they killed one of the bodies twice.
And they're such wily snakes in the grass...
They pretend to cry, be all upset...
It's really something!
What have you got yourself into?
What kind of people are these?
They're properpsychopaths.
- Psychopaths?
- I'm really giving myself a fright here.
If they were actually to say:
Let's bury the coffin...
...I'm so scared I won't be able to say
"Wait a minute, I'm in here".
What are you doing, smoking some
of the produce?
Hello? Hello?
Hello, Orhan what has happened?
Hello, can't you hear me?
Hello, Orhan?
- My best friend! Here, have some.
- What's going on?
- Here you go. 
- What's going on, have they buried you?
- Don't finish it, we're sharing.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Hello, where did you get to?
I dropped the phone, bro.
But I need to tell you something.
Wait a minute. Don't do it
like that, hang on.
It's very good stuff.
I swear to God, you know what
state I'm in at the moment?
I did wipe it but I think it
needs detergent.
Anyway, it'll have to wait
until I get back.
- Get rid of the truck.
- What?
You can't get rid of a blood stain
no matter how much you wipe it.
They'll see if they check the car
with a black light, you'll be in trouble.
What are you saying?
This truck is my life!
I'm just telling you.
Don't be upset.
We can buy you a new one, we
have all this money now.
Her boyfriend robbed a
gas station.
What gas station?
Look what we can do.
As soon as we arrive in Sivas we'll find a
carlot and buy you a brand new truck.
I just want to arrive at Sivas
alive and well.
Can one of you tell me, who robbed who,
whose money is this?
- God!
- What's going on?
- They're shooting, get down! Get down!
- God!
No one can take my money son!
You bastards!
Who the hell are these?
I swear to God
I don't know!
- Whom did you made angry now?
- I swear to God I didn't do anything!
Ayhan said there were some other
people at the gas station.
- Who's Ayhan? 
- The gent in the back with no head.
- The one who robbed the gas station?
- Yes.
Stop! Give us back our money!
Bring us our money back!
My God!
- Are they from the gas station?
- How should we know?
Maybe they're the people who
tried to rob the gas station.
I thought you said
Ayhan robbed the gas station?
My name is Eyvah Mehmed!
No one can take my money!
Step on it, won't this
thing go any faster?
I've got my foot to the ground
this is as fast as it will go!
What are we going to do?
Now, everyone's going to be quiet.
Cain and Abel will speak.
Bro, they have guns!
You don't say! Robbers with guns!
Fatso, what do you think
you have in your hand?
- A gun.
- Go ahead and shoot then!
- I'm low on ammo.
- What? What do we do?
What are we going to do?
Use this. It has only been used once.
What's that? You had a gun?
It's not mine, it's the deceased's.
It fell to the floor when he shot himself,
I hung onto it in case it came in handy.
You get on with it, what is
this anyway, lots of questions?
Just forthe two of us.
This is out too God damn it!
The bastards are shooting from both sides!
I'm going to waste you!
Fuck!
- What the hell are those?
- Huriye and Nuriye.
My fathers "girls". I stole them when I was
running away so that he wouldn't shoot me.
Look here, can you hold those?
Get your finger off the trigger.
- Get your finger off the trigger!
- What?
- Get me out of here!
- Get your head down!
Be quiet, the headman's calling.
- Hello?
- Salim, are you there yet?
Not long now, I'm very close.
What are those noises, are they shots?
No, no, they're sending off some kids
for their military service.
Military service? You don't send people
off at this time of the day?
- There's are the ones inbetween
two periods uncle. - Inbetween?
- Sounds like the war of the
inbetweeners. - What? I didn't hearyou.
God, my phone!
My phone!
My phone!
Never mind the phone, are you okay?
Turn around for a second?
Is he okay?
- Well...
- What? What happened?
Have I been hit?
- Your earlobe.
- What, what happened?
- It's hanging. - What?
- Stop!
My lobe! My lobe! My lobe!
My lobe! My lobe!
- My lobe! 
- No, keep your eyes on the road!
Pull yourself together! 
Keep your eyes on the road!
I've been shot!
I'm sure to die!
I had dreamt this!
My God, I'm shot!
Look at me.
You're not going to die. Look at me in
the eyes. You're not going to die.
Nothing's going to happen to you, okay?
Ok.
Now you hang on.
I'll show them!
My lobe. My lobe.
What do you mean by stealing Eyvah
Mehmet's money?
Get back here!
Ready... Take aim...
...Shire.
- Not like that, ready, take aim...
I hit them! I hit them! Salim!
You see, I hit them. I told you
nothing was going to happen to you.
I shot them.
Ready, take aim, shire and boom.
Bro, what are they shooting with?
I'm going to kill them all!
Don't break your oath, bro.
Tahsin. This is no time
for oaths. Come on!
Here, use this. It will stop the blood.
Thank you.
Are you allright?
I'm not dead yet.
Do you think we could have
my lobe sown back on?
Never mind, look you
have a nice scar now.
If not, we can have a
silicone one made for you.
We can do that?
We should go to the hospital
never the less.
What if I die of blood loss?
Hospital? We have a coffin and
two bodies in the back.
There are men on ourtails
and the truck is full of holes.
But what an adventure!
One earblew off.
My other earhas gone deaf.
The inside of the car
smells like burning.
Is it because of the guns?
It must be the cigarette.
I thought that smell
was coming from my ear.
This smells like burnt meat.
Burnt meat?
The coffin's on fire!
- The coffin's on fire!
- My God! My God!
Pull over! Pull over now!
- I can't, we're on a highway!
- Just pull over!
- Into the first empty space!
- My God!
- Pull over here!
- God help us all!
- Hold this. - Fire!
- Help me, it's on fire, hold this!
Nevermind, you'll get burnt!
Hold this! Come on, help me!
Where can I hold it from?
It's on fire!
- Don't you have a fire extinguisher?
- No, I don't.
Find water! Find water!
- Find water.
- Water.
Where are we going to find water?
Just let it burn.
Bro, should we pee on it?
You set the man on fire
and then you pee on him?
Who are you peeing on?
That's my father!
- What?
- Your father?
- Your father?
- Yes, my father.
But we set him on fire
God damn it!
Look here, were you
that bastard of a son?
Yes, it was me!
Do something! Come overhere.
God!
Mind the car!
Check if the bag is in the car.
What's up?
The bag isn't here boss.
Ok, follow me.
I was small.
I started working with a guy
to earn money.
A rich man.
The bastard shot someone.
He wanted me to take the fall
because I was younger.
I didn't want to.
They framed me.
I ran away.
I ran away...
...but they wouldn't give comfort
to my father in Sivas,
saying "Your son is a murderer. "
The pooerman sold everything and moved on.
For years I couldn't even go to him.
I thought I could at least collect his body
and take it back to our village.
Even that wasn't meant to be.
I'm feeling peckish. Do you have
biscuits or something in your bag?
No. I was about to ask you.
It smells so lovely meat.
That's my dad that you're smelling!
I made that mistake
right at the begininng.
Right at the start.
That's what comes of doing business
with an idiot like you.
For Heaven's sake, bro.
Am I the one who lost the money?
Tahsin...
You know what I mean.
My God humanity is dead,
not a single car stops!
Could it be because they're
mistaking you for a bear?
Look here.
I'll show you how it's done.
They'll stop. Why?
I'm a good quality guy.
That's Gucur...
That's Gucur! Gucur!
Gucur!
Catch them! Surround them!
Come here you!
- Ok! - Where do you think you're going?
Where do you think you're going?
Where is that bastard?
Get overhere!
You know, I'm feeling a little dizzy.
We must have got poisoned
by the smoke.
Here, eat. It'll do you good.
Could I borrow yourphone?
Mine exploded.
Here. Talk as much as you want.
It's number one's phone.
- Number one? 
- The one you ran over and then shot.
He isn't answering.
Bro, he's not answering.
It's not my fault you know...
Look my girl.
We're up to ournecks in it already.
Don't go down with us.
Let's get you onto a car
go home to your family.
I can't. I have run away.
Besides, if I go back they'll kill me
don't you get it?
Whatever next.
Even if he gets mad, orhits you,
he is your father at the end of the day.
He'll get mad at you, but
forgive you later.
It's better than being in this
situation.
Look at me.
Call your father.
Bro, number one's daughteris calling.
She hung up.
That's my father's phone!
This is my father's phone!
No, this belongs to
the man I ran over.
The one I killed first.
Daddy!
My father!
- My father! - Now you've had it.
- Had what?
- You know.
- What?
You know!
Dad! Dad!
Dad!
Mommy!
Goodness...
- Mommy. 
- That's enough. Lay him down here.
Why do you think we were
running after you for two hours,
you thought you could outrun us?
Where is my money?
Where is my money?
Honorable Mr Gucur...
...I swear to God we don't 
have your money.
It's in an old truck.
They had a coffin in the boot.
They took it.
Atruck. Atruck with a
coffin in the boot, right?
Where the hell is this truck?
Bro, they shot at us with
something very strange.
Our front kaput flew into the air.
And we spun around.
Really?
What happened next?
The our car got wrecked bro.
But if I caught them I would
get our money.
I mean, your money.
We understood we were at fault and
decided to return it all to you.
I swear to God.
- You swear to God?
- Yes, I do.
As far as I remember, you stole my money.
You burst in. I said don't.
You didn't listen.
Then you tied me up.
Then he came,
you gave the money to him.
I swear to God I didn't take it.
I think it was Mehmet whom took it.
- You think it was Mehmet?
- Yes.
Who's the guy you thought was Mehmet?
- The man in the truck.
- In the truck.
The man in the truck with a coffin
in the back.
That's exactly it sir.
Where is my money?
Where is my money?
Where is my money?
The truck...
Bro... This is bad, right?
So, you killed my father?
Stop, what are you doing?
Stop! You're going to make an accident!
That was my father!
Put that away! It's about to go off!
But we've gone so much together.
Yourfather died by accident!
Where's the accident?
You shot him!
Come back here!
Stop! Don't!
- Come back here!
- Stop!
Don't!
I'll kill you as well!
What will you do now?
I wouldn't have shot him if
I knew he was your father!
I wouldn't have!
Say something!
Don't come any closer!
I'm not a murderer.
How come? You burnt his father.
You shot mine.
What else could you do?
You hidden psychopath.
You're a murderer!
Look, sister, I'm not a murderer!
Fuck!
Father?
My father!
Whore!
Dad! Dad!
Dad!
Are you sure?
This time, it's for sure.
What a mess!
It wasn't your fault.
If it'll make you feel any better,
the same thing happened to me.
I had the guns in my hand.
And I stood up suddenly.
Just like you...
He called me a whore.
His last words were
calling me a whore.
- It's my Mom.
- Well, answer it.
- Mom?
- Hello? Nihal?
- Nihal are you okay, my dear?
- Yes mom, I'm fine...
- My dear, where are you?
- My father...
- Yes my dear, your father, he...
- My father...
My dear, run for your life, I swear to God
your father's going to kill you.
He'll kill you, my dear!
Run, run away my daughter.
I'll be patient and wait foryou.
- He was going to kill me.
- Don't move!
Where's the bag?
In the car...
The truck.
Well, well, well.
Look at her. I would never have
thought of it bro!
My girlfriend is trying
to cheat me, is that it?
Did you do all of this for him?
It has nothing to do with him.
I only ran away to get rid of you.
I did everything you asked.
You were starving on the street!
Your father earned
a few coppers thanks to me!
Is it all there?
It's all here boss.
Isn't that Uncle Halit?
Woman, what happened to Uncle Halit?
I shot my father.
You killed your father?
No she didn't really, you see when
I fell on her...
- Shut up!
- Stop it for one second!
Don't harm him, he's innocent.
It was all Ayhan.
He stole your money.
- It was all his plan!
- And now we have Ayhan!
Who the hell is Ayhan?
He didn't steal it this one did.
No, not him, that one did.
How many of them are there?
How many people are behind you.
Have you got the whole town
behind you, you whore!
Don't call me a whore!
What if I do call you a whore?
You're a whore!
Your're a little whore.
There, I've said it, now what.
This is what's going to happen. Everyone
will shut up, Cain and Abel will speak.
Who the hell are Cain and Abel?
Allow me.
Salim? Salim, please don't die!
Salim! Don't die! Please come round!
Salim please don't die!
Salim!
Dear veiwers, there is carnage on the
highway to Mersin, Taþucu.
There are six bodies at the scene and
they are all badly burnt.
We're going live dearviewers, please
keep your children away from the screen.
It's a carnage. We will be showing you
the scene as soon as we get permission.
He has woken up!
Am I dead?
Where are we?
At the sea.
What are we doing on the sea?
We're running away!
- Where to?
- Cyprus.
We're waiting fornightfall.
- What did you do with the truck?
- It burnt along with the bodies.
- What?
- What could we have done?
We didn't leave anyone alive
behind!
We piled up all the bodies
and burnt them with gasoline.
That's when your truck exploded.
What do you mean?
- My beauty!
- Here, this is all that's left of it!
It's too early to say anything.
All the bodies are burnt.
They're unrecognisable.
- Six of them, correct, sir?
- Eight.
Eight?
In the back of the truck, we found
two other bodies embracing each other.
- And a gun. 
- He says there are two more bodies!
- In fact...
- He says they're embracing!
Salim, did you put someone
else into my father's coffin?
How would I do that?
I can't even touch them. Dear God!
I just don't get you. Are you making
fun of me or what?
- What's not to get? I'm a coward.
- You're a coward?
You faced a bullet to
save Nihal!
I did?
When Nihal's father came back from the dead
again, I fainted from fright!
Well, I was the only one who hadn't
shot him, now that's complete too.
He's completely dead now, right?
I wish you hadn't killed Nihal's father.
Am I the only one who killed him?
So many people killed him
before me!
Now.
I ran him over. Did he die? No.
Nihal and I both shot him.
Did he die? No.
You shot him, he died.
Sir! Sir!
There's a live one under the burnt bodies
and he's swearing!
- What is he saying?
- He's yelling: Whore!
DearGod, what kind of killers
are these people?
They've actually burnt him alive, God
knows what the reason was...
Judging from the swearword, one of
them is a woman.
People on the boat!
Mummy!
The Coast Guards, the last
thing we need!
Why? We don't have any bodies
with us?
- There aren't, are there?
- True, there aren't.
Good day to you, sir!
What are you doing there?
We're sightseeing.
Why, what's wrong?
These are military waters.
Get out of here.
We didn't know sir, we're going.
Don't worry.
Come on, let's go.
But... That's...
It really is him!
No way!
I told you we should have
tied a stone to him!
