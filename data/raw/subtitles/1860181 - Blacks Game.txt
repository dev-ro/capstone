OK, here's how it is.
You've been awake for five days,
you're king of the hill and
you've just finished feeding your nose.
There's a chick hanging on to you,
babbling on,
but you can't hear a word she says.
All your senses are mixed up and have
stopped working the way they should.
You're wondering where the hell you are,
and whose place this is
where you've been hanging out
for as long as you can remember,
could be two
hours or two days.
Not that it fucking matters, what's
more important is where you were before,
and i'm not talking about
this club or that bar,
No, you need to go further back.
Cause even though you know deep down
that the journey ends in darkness,
it doesn't necessarily mean
that it started in darkness.
Based on shit that
actually happened
REYKJAVIK, MARCH 1999.
You don't remember
the fight at all?
- No.
- Nothing?
Do you drink a lot?
You a blackout guy?
- No.
- No.
Toti, is that you?
It's me, Stebbi, from Olafsvik.
How are you, man?
Good.
What are you doing here?
I spent the night.
Why?
Some drunken bullshit.
I'm probably looking at an assault charge.
- Do you have a lawyer?
- No, not yet.
That won't do.
You need a good lawyer.
Trust me, I know.
Stebbi.
Is your mother still out west?
Yeah, out west.
What about yours?
How's she doing?
She hangs in there, the old broad.
Look, if you get in trouble,
just contact me.
Toti! i hadn't seen him much
since we were kids in Olafsvik.
Our mothers were best friends at the time
and his father the town's minister.
And even though Toti
was two years older,
he and his friends
let me hang with them,
popping sea sickness pills,
watching porn and shit like that.
But after his father died when he was 12,
he and his mom moved to Reykjavik.
Toti dear?
Since then i'd just heard some
crazy stories about the guy.
All i knew was that he didn't
study theology like his father.
What are you doing?
This mother dear, is Dextro Amphetamine
Phenylpropanolamine. Speed!
- Stefan Kormakur Jonsson
- Yes.
Hello, I'm from the Reykjavik Police,
I'm handing you a summons.
They called it a
"reckless and aggravated assault. "
"Up to five years of imprisonment",
and "personal injury claim. "
Mum?
I was wondering if you
knew of any openings?
No, I'm not quitting school.
I'm just thinking ahead
for the summer.
Yeah.
OK. Yeah.
Thanks.
Bye.
- I don't like it.
- What are you afraid of?
Even though the cops didn't find
jack shit there,
it doesn't mean that Robbi
hid the stash in his apartment.
There's only one fucking
way to find out, isn't there.
Toti.
- Hey, it's Stebbi here.
- What? Stebbi who?
Stebbi, from Olafsvik.
From the police station the other day.
What's up?
I was thinking about what
you said about the lawyer.
Can you recommend anyone?
Did you get charged?
Yeah, and a personal injury claim,
fucking bullshit.
No problem, I can get you
in touch with a real lawyer.
Really?
Yeah, you just have
to do me a favour in return.
- I scratch your back, you scratch mine.
- Sure, no problem.
- Are you free now?
- Yes.
- Do you have a license?
- Sure.
This here opens an apartment on
Kleppsvegur 66, top floor to the right.
Go in there and see
if you can find something for me.
It's extremely well hidden.
The cops couldn't even find it.
What is it?
It's best that you don't know.
In case you get busted.
Just imagine where you'd hide
12 big ass chocolate bars.
That can't be found.
If you do this for me, Stebbi...
I'll get you in touch with
Viktor Marteinsson, my lawyer.
He'll get you acquitted.
I guarantee it.
- You think so?
- Think?
This is chicken shit compared
with what Viktor normally deals with.
Still I don't know...
Taking this chance because
of the charge, at this point I mean.
Sure, perhaps you're right.
At this point...
Best to be patient, wait it out,
and see what happens.
Who knows, the charge might
vanish from the system or something.
Fuck it.
That's right!
Look, there's one thing.
If something happens...
have you heard of "Moment Zero"?
No?
Sometimes there are moments,
when you get into extreme situations
where it's very important to keep face.
No matter what.
You just scream two words,
not out loud, but in your head.
Two words.
Fuck. You!
Then you just do the first
thing that comes to mind.
No matter how crazy.
You just do it without thinking.
That's it.
Who are you?
Robbi told you where he hid the hash?
Did you speak to Robbi?
Are you fucking mute?
Calm down.
Relax!
Stebbi Psycho!
You realise the shit
you just stepped into?
What!
- You know who that guy was?
- No.
The motherfucker you almost killed?
Was the one and only Einar Skakki!
You know Joi who owns Venus?
Joi "Pharaoh"?
Yeah, I've heard of him.
Einar works for him.
His right hand guy.
Are you good?
No, can't say that I am.
Just relax, it'll be fine.
With Joi "Pharaoh"
and Einar Skakki on my ass?
Hey while you're with me,
no one's going to touch you.
Oh, really?
Stebbi, I take care of my own,
don't fucking worry about that.
Now, we'll just set up a meeting
with Viktor, take care of that charge.
And never think about
that business earlier.
Eat something.
Gotta stabilise your blood sugar.
Who's this Robbi?
Robbi, the rat?
He lives in that charming apartment.
The Rat's Nest.
He's in police custody, the idiot.
Einar Skakki is his uncle.
2 YEARS EARLIER
What the fuck!
Always the same hassle with you.
Bulldozing your way through everyone.
Well now, how's everyone?
- Wasn't it a piece of cake?
- Yeah. Sort of.
But there wasn't as much shit
there as there was supposed to be.
Really?
Bullshit!
No bullshit. We checked it out. Me
and your nephew here, didn't we, Robbi?
- And what? Are you clean now?
- Yes.
There's not one gram left
in that house, I guarantee it.
Recently restored.
I checked under the hood.
The engine looks beautiful.
Worth at least 3.5 million.
The deed.
Let's go to the bar guys.
My treat. Jager all around.
Joi "Pharaoh" and Einar "Skakki"
were true Icelandic pioneers.
They had been on the front lines
of the Icelandic drug business
for more than two decades.
in the 1970's The Pharaoh
was the first Icelandic citizen to be sent
to prison for dealing drugs.
When speed became the "it"
drug during the punk era,
the ball truly started to roll for Joi.
He became well known
as the owner of Club Venus,
a strip joint
in the heart of Reykjavik.
When he bought his villa, he registered it
in his wife's name of course.
He paid for it in cash.
Rumour had it that the Pharaoh enjoyed
a cosy relationship with the Narcs.
He gave them info on the competition
and in turn they left him alone.
But in any case,
one thing was clear.
For decades, nobody in this business
had been able to touch The Pharaoh.
But in the wake of a falling out
between Toti and the Pharaoh
when he caught Toti selling Ecstasy
behind his back and went apeshit,
Toti decided to go all in and started
competing for the Pharaoh's business.
Nori, stop leaving those damn
skateboards all over the place.
This is little Nori.
Always on the computer.
A genius.
We're cousins after all!
Go ahead and put Stebbi
in the system.
- Really?
- Yeah.
OK, I'll need a name,
social security number and address.
And you'll have to bring your tax card in.
Where do you want him?
Why not the car wash.
Toti, I'm not sure
I can do this full time.
You know,
with school and everything.
Stebbi, just fill this out.
It's only a cover.
Come on, let's go upstairs.
There you are, you asshole.
I've called you a hundred times today.
I heard you ran out of the tattoo parlour.
What the fuck is going on?
Are you going to cry, or are you
going to finish your tanning session?
Just pick up the phone when I call you.
Is that complicated?
Who's this?
What piece of shit
are you dragging in here?
Calm down. Stebbi's cool.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Didn't we agree on not going
anywhere near this fucking "soap"?
At least we have it now.
Better than the Pharaoh having it. Right?
Was no one staking out the Rat's Nest?
Yah, Skakki. He decided to drop by
on a social call.
Really? What happened?
We made him feel welcome,
me and this psycho.
- He almost killed him.
- I wouldn't go that far.
Who the fuck is this guy
and why is he speaking?
Saevar, he's a fucking nut job
that can hold his own in a fight
with Einar Skakki.
They don't come any tougher that that.
We need guys like that
in this business.
- He's disgusting.
- Stebbi is my responsibility, OK.
Dagny, baby!
You're early today.
Oh, shut up.
- Hustling big time tonight?
- Well, there's a huge party at OZ tonight.
Say hi to the new crazy guy in the crew,
Stebbi Psycho.
That's just what I need.
Look, Saevar, I need about
20 extra grams for tonight.
20? For the OZ party?
I'm not just going there.
There are imported DJ's
at Skuggabar and stuff.
It's going to be crazy crowded.
OK, let's see what we have.
Coming?
- Bye.
- Bye.
- See ya.
- Bye.
- Let's get you set up with a salary.
- What?
A salary?
Yeah, before Nori puts you
in the system.
At least now you can afford a hair cut.
Yes, Florida always delivers.
Yes, I can make that work.
Yes, exactly.
Look just go ahead and book it,
just tell me how much to pay.
I have to talk to you later.
I spoke to the idiots
down at the police station.
Right.
Got copies of all the case
files as well as the charge.
"Life threatening, aggravated assault".
Got a short fuse my friend?
I think this cop that took your statement
did a real poor job.
Really?
Conflicting witness statements
and I don't know what else.
We should find loads here
to dispute in court.
What, are these steroids?
We stopped that kind of baby stuff
long ago, right, Saevar?
This is much more potent.
Increases your insulin.
I get it from my doctor.
Necessary before any workout.
You just pinch the fat,
and inject.
Well, pussies...
Lift this up!
Lift this up!
8... 9... 10...
10 I said!
Pain is satisfaction!
Pain is satisfaction!
Cheers!
Toti, look...
I just want to thank you for everything,
getting me in touch with Viktor.
And the job...
Stebbi, cut the sentimental bullshit.
It's just the privilege you get
by being a part of the Inner Circle.
It's fantastic to have a guy like you
on the team,
someone I've known forever
and can trust completely.
- Hi!
- Hi.
- Baby! How are you?
- Great, and you?
Am I in danger, locked
in a room with Stebbi Psycho?
You never know.
What's going on with your case?
Got a date for your hearing yet?
Not until late fall at the earliest.
Fucking bullshit.
You don't have to worry,
Viktor's got this shit down, understand.
He's knows what he's doing.
What's up?
A little favour for my uncle.
He built a house for some guy
who refuses to pay him,
even though he has a shit ton of money.
Total asshole.
Owes him around 16 million.
Here, put this on.
Wait, is the guy here?
No, but he keeps a horse here.
An Icelandic champion.
Expensive piece of shit. I'm gonna send
the guy a message, a nice lesson.
You've seen The Godfather, right?
What?
How the hell am I supposed
to know which horse is his?
Dammit!
They aren't marked or anything?
What, are you gonna blow me?
Dammit, man.
Well, I guess
we'll just have to do them all.
Right...
What do you think is the best way?
- One massive blow?
- I don't know.
Goddamn interruptions.
- Hello?
- Hey, man.
Robbi, where the hell have you been?
We haven't heard a peep from you
since you were released from custody.
It's been weeks.
Well, I've been...it's been busy.
I've been doing all kinds of shit.
Yeah, yeah right...
I heard you found the "soap"
in my apartment.
- Yeah, no thanks to you.
- I was in fucking solitary!
- Robbi?
- Yeah?
Shut up. What do you want?
I was just thinking,
are you busy right now?
- What the fuck? Who is this?
- Relax. He's alright.
No, seriously, man.
There's no room...
Robbi, if we are going to hold your hand
through this "thing", he's coming along.
Fucking spit it out,
what's going on?
Look the only thing
I can tell you right now...
Is that we're going
to Hvalfjordur. OK?
- That's the only thing?
- Yeah.
Either spit it out, or I'll shove this
up your fucking ass, Robbi!
OK, it's an insurance scam.
It's a solid project.
Who's with you on this?
- What do you mean?
- Who organised it?
I know it wasn't you.
Spit it out!
OK, OK. Fuck!
I can tell you that...
You know him.
He just moved back from Copenhagen.
Bruno, the devil himself.
Always the same overgrown cow.
You're here?
Is it true what I'm hearing
that you've stopped sucking
Einar Skakki and the Pharaoh's cocks?
What?
You heard me.
Fucking bullshit.
I can handle my own shit.
don't you worry about that.
I still remember you, down on your knees,
shaking like a little girl.
Come on, that's enough.
Well, Robbi, now it's your turn.
Come here.
We'll assume you wore a seatbelt, right?
Guys can we just...
Over... on the shoulder.
Ready?
How does it look?
Yeah. Looks good.
We're just missing what?
2-3 broken ribs...
and maybe a fractured collarbone.
Put him on the car.
- Fucking insanity.
- Jesus!
Toti, come talk to me.
What do you think about
us working together?
What do you have in mind?
Well, I have a ton of contacts
in Copenhagen and Amsterdam.
They can get us whatever we want.
Then we just get all
the smaller dealers on our side.
And all the little smugglers.
The first thing we have to guarantee
are good transport routes.
Then make sure
we have some start up capital.
With this?
Among other things.
We'll get at least
18-20 million from this.
If he doesn't freeze to death
before someone finds him.
How long do you think The Rat
lasts against his uncle Einar Skakki?
Especially after he was busted
with all those drugs the other day.
You really think that Narc didn't try
to make a deal with him?
I think this is just as good
as it's gonna get for Robbi.
Think about it.
I mean you're either
with us or you're not.
it was around 6 am that the police
was called to the scene of the accident
after the car had swerved off the road
and down to the sea here in Hvalfjordur.
The driver who was alone in the car,
was gravely injured
when he was found
stuck inside the vehicle.
You lost control of the car
in a very dangerous spot,
how did this happen?
Uh, well. . .
i was just driving
and the weather was terrible.
Do you fear for your life?
Yeah. i sometimes fear for my life.
My cousin Ingo just tells me
the number of the container.
And before Customs arrives,
I stop by to pick up the package.
It's a fucking piece of cake.
So are you buying the 3kg
from us or...?
Yeah, sure.
But that's not the main issue.
It's you and your cousin
we want to invest in.
After Bruno sent in a giant order
for all kinds of drugs,
we needed a reliable route to transport it
here to the "ice rock".
But smuggling shit to Iceland
is no fucking joke.
But with the Samskip cousins we got
a reliable "bridge" to mainland Europe.
The other cousin, Ingo, worked for
Samskip's Copenhagen branch.
This guy here, was a runner for
Bruno's business partners.
His code name was
"Soren the Electrician".
Every other week he would
deliver a package for Ingo.
Our distribution network was a total
revolution in Iceland's drug trade.
You all know Herbalife, right?
- Dietary crap for women and fags.
- Shut the fuck up!
It's a clever scam,
Saevar has earned millions from it.
Exactly.
This is our pyramid.
We're here on the top.
Buying and importing.
The top points out to sea.
Bruno and I handle
all foreign communications.
Stebbi here, Stebbi Psycho, he'll be
our private driver. Our right hand, man.
Then there are those two areas here.
Area 1 and area 2.
We split Reykjavik into two,
Saevar and Dagny
are at the top of each pyramid.
They handle all communications
with the street dealers.
Take orders and things like that.
Here in the middle,
is the "Neutral Zone".
You can see it doesn't overlap
with the other pyramids.
All new shipments were immediately
taken to the Neutral Zone,
secret hiding places somewhere
in the city.
That way there was never
any connection
between the importation
and the inner Circle.
But where will I be?
Robbi, while the insurance checks
are still coming in,
you're only doing physical therapy
and rehab full time.
We're not taking any chances
with that.
Yeah sure, I understand that.
I just thought you guys could use me.
I have areas 101 and 107...
Robbi, while you're always
so fucked up and out of it,
you can't be trusted with anything.
What's with the fucking
disrespect all the time, man!
I've sacrificed myself for this shit
and I'm sick of these cheap shots.
- Relax, Robbi.
- Listen, it's very simple.
If you want to end up on the floor with
busted kidneys and more broken ribs
both shoulders dislocated, then please
be my guest, and come a little closer.
From now on, we all
carry three mobile phones,
One is for the Inner Circle only.
And if there's any suspicion of a leak,
everyone must talk to Nori
and get a new SIM card immediately.
This one here is for all other business
and the third is your private phone.
The only one registered to your names.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
The Bakery was
the heart of the operation.
Every fucking imported gram went
through there before hitting the streets.
- Hi, Stebbi.
- Hi.
Can you put 30 grams of that pure stuff
on my private account?
Sure, no problem.
- No cigarettes in here!
- Oh right! Sorry!
Then on the way to the dealers,
the product again
went into the Neutral Zone.
And the dealers never knew
where to pick up their orders,
until it had been planted.
Well, the semester finished
two weeks ago.
I've gotten myself
a great job here.
Till the fall, you know...
Pays better than the fish factory,
I can tell you that much.
Yeah, well, all kinds of stuff...
Importation and things.
You actually know my boss Toti.
Remember. Son of minister
Gudsteinn and your friend Elsa.
He's doing very well for himself here.
Listen, do you need me
to get you anything?
The fucking genius thing
about our system was
that if a dealer got careless and got
himself busted, he couldn't squeal. Why?
Simply because he didn't know
a fucking thing about anything.
But that didn't mean
that he was free and clear from us.
You see, for Toti, it didn't matter if
people owed 15 million or 15 thousand.
A debt is a debt,
and it has got to be paid.
You got busted selling our shit,
the shit was confiscated,
ergo you owe us the street value.
- Understand?
- Yes!
And the most important
rule is to never give an inch.
You have 48 hours to pay
and no fucking stolen crap!
As soon as we stop breaking bones,
our bones will be broken,
it's as simple as that.
The last thing in Bruno's master plan
was to simply erase the competition.
Shut the fuck up!
These old guys were over
in this business anyway.
Besides taking every last gram
from the Pharaoh's stock,
we also took over the few dealers
and enforcers that still worked for him.
We even had him sign over
the crown jewel itself, Club Venus.
And it didn't take Bruno long
to turn the joint into fat profit.
CLUB VENUS BURNS DOWN
NEW OWNERS SHELL SHOCKED
Who is it?
Stebbi? Hi.
- Hi how are you?
- Good, you?
Why haven't you answered your phone,
I've called like 20 times.
Oh shit.
Am I interrupting something perhaps...
What? Er, well...
just a little research...
Yeah...
I'm at a party close by,
I was hoping you had something?
For you? Absolutely.
- Oh really?
- Of course.
Come over here.
You know I'm not buying it,
the whole "psycho" stuff.
What about now?
- Oh fuck, Stebbi, wait.
- What?
Oh fuck. Do you have a tissue?
I'll be fine in a bit.
Maybe just a little nap.
Tired huh?
I've been awake for four days.
Sometimes I think
I should take some holidays.
Dagny?
Hey, Bruno?
What are you waiting for?
It's green already.
Bruno operated best at night.
And in the winter,
the nights can get very, very long.
The night has just about ended
when the next one takes over.
And then the next one,
and the next. . .
Take the next right.
But i couldn't complain.
i couldn't sleep much anyway.
Better than sitting on my ass at home,
counting down the minutes
until my damn court hearing.
Are we good?
Now you can go home
and finish jerking off over Dagny.
- Huh?
- Stebbi Psycho!
Across the globe, both private
and public companies and institutions
are preparing their computer
systems for the Y2K problem.
A special Y2K delegation from
Scandinavia is now visiting Iceland
to advise local computer scientists
on how to deal with the situation. . .
Check this, the Rat has turned into
a fucking celebrity.
His father has been making
a scene at the police station.
Wait, how long has he been missing?
I don't know...
what... 3-4 months.
The person you are trying
to reach is not available,
please try again later.
Same story.
What's up?
No idea.
DRUG FREE ICELAND
They have two months.
- Hi.
- Hey, cutie.
- Good to see you again.
- You too.
What's this?
ENTRANCE/CASHIER
i finally understood what
all those nights timing different routes,
and other field research,
were all about.
The only purpose of this shotgun
is scaring people in the bank.
In the bank there will be
ordinary people
and ordinary people all react
the same way to a shotgun.
I'm not gonna shoot anyone,
but I'll leave it loaded.
OK, this is how it'll be.
Cashier, cashier, cashier.
Customer, customer
and the rest of us in the car.
When I say "Go"
we rush inside the bank.
You with me?
- Should I leave the motor running?
- Yes.
Go!
- Stebbi, the fucking child safety is on!
- Sorry, man.
This is a robbery!
Everybody on the floor, now!
Face down on the floor you fuck.
The first person who looks up is dead.
Is that understood?
Go!
Go!
Get the bitch going!
Go!
Masks off!
Start the car!
The fucking windshield
wipers aren't working, man.
Give me the ice scraper.
Not too fast. Not too fast
- How did it go?
- Fine.
Go take a shower. Need to rinse way
the "devils aura" after a job like that.
- Have you guys counted yet?
- Probably around 3-4 mills.
You're kidding right?
I mean, that's a good days revenue
from the Neutral Zone?
Nobody is gonna get rich from
bank robberies here in Iceland.
But this is chicken shit!
It's not about the money, Stebbi!
Don't you get that?
Bruno's... he's fried his fucking brain.
Finally when things are starting to roll.
We are rid of the Pharaoh.
It's simply stupid taking
these kinds of risks.
OK, it might be fun and all that.
The adrenaline rush of robbing a bank.
But we're running
a fucking business here. Understand.
Like stated previously on the news,
the robbers jumped over the counters
and emptied four cashier's drawers.
All the bank's employees
were in danger,
as the robbers were armed
with shotguns.
it's almost 8 o'clock now and there are
no new developments in the case.
No one has yet been arrested.
Good morning.
Do you live here?
I'm from the internet company downstairs.
Could you please turn the volume down?
We can hear the music
playing loudly downstairs.
What time is it?
Ten.
it was going to be a hectic day
and i was already way too late.
i had to exchange 13 million
into dollars to be shipped to Holland.
The thing is that you can only exchange
499 thousand at a time.
More than that and you needed
a passport and tons of paperwork.
This meant that i had to make numerous
trips to different banks
in the next few hours.
- Good morning.
- Dollars.
Hey, Mum...
it's me...
Yeah, sorry...
It's just that things at work
have been totally crazy.
I know... I know...
Listen, I'm thinking about
coming home during the holidays.
What do you think?
Mum?
Fucking piece of shit!
Mum? Sorry, but the reception here
is really bad.
I'll call you soon.
OK, yes... OK.
Bye, Mum.
- Yes?
- Greetings, Viktor here.
Have you forgotten
about our appointment?
i was so fucked up, that i completely
forgot my own date in court.
Case number S607 in 1999
is now in session.
i just sat there trying my best
to listen to the judge's verdict.
Because of some technical mistakes
in the prosecution's case
which Viktor emphasised repeatedly,
i was cleared of all the charges.
And the police was reprimanded for using
excessive force during the arrest.
While i, the victim of the excessive force,
didn't have to pay any legal fees.
Catch you later...
i was so numb that when i should
have been relieved, i felt nothing.
Yes.
What did I always tell you?
Viktor never misses his mark.
Get the hell out of there,
it's time to celebrate, man.
But I haven't finished exchanging all
the money to dollars. I have to wrap it...
Fuck that shit.
Saevar's parents are on holidays
and we're having
an old school party at the villa.
Just hurry up dude. See you there.
A part of me wanted to disappear.
Take time off from all the crap.
But another part of me
wanted to keep going.
i knew which part would win.
- Hey, man.
- Hey!
What's this?
Rush, man,
makes everyone horny as hell.
This guy too?
Jump in, man.
Stebbi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
- Viktor knows his stuff right?
- Yeah, he sure does.
Let's make a toast.
You look so tired honey.
You have circles under your eyes.
Yeah, haven't slept for days now.
- Were you that stressed?
- Nah, just been very busy.
Have you ever tried
100% pure cocaine?
- Does that even exist?
- Sure.
Here, straight over from Peru.
Where the finest snow comes from.
Whoa! This is the shit, man!
- I'm expecting a kilo of this stuff.
- Oh really? Wow.
That was insane.
Service!
You expect anything less?
Nope.
I'm still in the mood.
You seem to be as well.
It would be nice to get
some more of Bruno's coke.
I wouldn't mind owning a kilo of that stuff.
I'd be quite content with that.
Yeah, that would be worth
shitloads of money.
Not money, I'm talking about
a fucking non-stop party.
Stebbi. Stebbi. Stop it.
- You leaving?
- You coming?
In a minute.
- So did you get what you wanted?
- Huh?
Dagny? Did she meet
all your expectations?
Uh, yeah. Sure.
I figured you wouldn't say no to her.
Let's cut the crap.
Bend over.
Now!
What part of that don't
you understand?
When I speak,
I expect you to obey.
Shut up!
This will be our little secret.
Just between us.
You and me.
OK, loverboy?
You and me
Are so overwhelmingly in love
Even though you are just 16
i am 17 since last fall.
You and me could
so easily get married
Even though we are young
i will take care of you, darling,
unconditionally
The day will come
that we will have gotten old
And what we'ii want then,
is difficult to say
Will you want me,
and will i want you?
You and me, my dear,
will have to wait a while. . . .
What's going on here?
Saevar? Saevar,
where are you my son?
What the hell are you
doing back so soon?
Let him go! Let him go I said!
Saevar! Have you gone insane?
Saevar K just blew a fuse
when his parents came home
two days early from their holiday.
They had to subdue him
before he killed his mother.
And then during the night while
his mother was in intensive care.
Saevar K simply
decided to end it all.
The funeral was held in quiet.
No flowers please.
Stebbi, where the fuck have you been?
- Just catching up on some sleep.
- Shut up and listen.
The 100% pure Peru Coke
has landed.
You have to take it
to the Bakery AS AP.
- It's in the shore close to the "Pigsty".
- What?
Where our cunt of a president lives!
Stefan Kormakur Jonsson.
How are you?
My name is Arni Jonsson
Special Investigation Unit.
Can you spare us a few seconds?
I'm kind of in a hurry.
It will only take a few minutes.
We're in the car over there.
Just finish filling up your car,
then come over.
Well, Stefan...are you guys
quite busy these days?
Huh?
Aren't the holidays
the busiest season of the year?
Especially now, with the Centennial
just around the corner?
The Bakery must be
hectic with traffic... right?
Stefan.
Here's the situation.
We just got the results from
a DNA test the British did for us.
From a hair we found on the
seat of a certain Lada Station.
A green one.
You know what we're talking about.
Fuck my luck!
But apparently this hair
was just a drop in the ocean.
For about a year a whole unit
was specially assigned to our operation.
They had been watching our every move
and listening to our conversations.
And when i accidentally called
my Mum on the wrong phone,
they finally got full
access to the inner Circle.
Their main focus was on Bruno,
being the head of our operation.
Plus they wanted to nail
him for Robbi's disappearance.
They were sure Bruno was behind it.
We know that Bruno
is the head honcho.
And we have evidence
suggesting he played a key part
in Robert's disappearance.
We just need a confession.
Him on tape admitting it.
And that's where we need your help.
You'll get rewarded,
a reduced sentence for sure.
Maybe even a suspended sentence.
The next time you meet up with Bruno,
call this number.
Put the phone in your pocket.
Just be careful to keep the line open.
To make sure we hear everything.
Then focus on getting
him to talk about Robbi, OK?
And just so you know,
you are not the only one
we're speaking to from the Inner Circle.
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
- How's it going?
- Who are those guys?
- Some Lithuanians, friends of Bruno.
- OK.
Where have you been baby?
I've been looking all over for you.
- Have you seen Toti?
- No, not tonight.
Do you know where he is?
How's Mr Psycho doing?
What can we get you?
We have E, Alaskan snow,
speed, acid and roll ups.
OK, wow. I'm good.
- Do you have a passport?
- A passport? Sure.
Great, meet me outside
in the car in two minutes.
Yes, we're listening.
I don't know what's going on,
but Bruno is on his way into my car now.
Try to steer the conversation
to Robbi's disappearance.
Yes, I'll try.
Drive.
Where are we going?
Just drive straight ahead.
Take the next left.
Towards the bridge?
Just drive. I'll tell you when to turn,
and when not to turn.
Have a seat.
You're going on an important
business trip to Hamburg tomorrow.
You'll be flying through Copenhagen.
- What? Tomorrow?
- Relax.
The flight is in the afternoon.
You can still party hard tonight.
All the info is in there.
You're delivering a payment.
If customs gives you an attitude
just tell them you're buying a sports car.
Wait, I thought Toti sent
this bag on a boat the other day?
Stebbi, I'm going to confide in you.
Toti will soon be assigned to a new post,
he is getting way too soft.
Toti! Too soft?
Either that,
or he's stabbing us in the back.
Do you remember that
100% pure Peruvian coke?
It arrived the other day.
Only Toti and I knew about it.
He was going to take
it to the Bakery.
But it never got there.
I checked it out myself.
It arrived to the country,
went into the Neutral Zone
But then it just disappeared.
- Unless you have it?
- No!
Follow me,
I want to show you something.
Open it.
- What?
- Open the box.
Do I need to come and get you?
This is what happens to rats
that betray their friends.
Never forget that.
Is it the hand of...
You know exactly who it is.
Just remember, we were
childhood friends, me, him and Toti.
So you can only imagine what happens
to idiots I don't know as well.
Did you kill the Rat?
What do you have there?
I see.
No signal.
We must ask Nori
to get you a better phone.
Although you'll never get
good connection in here.
Which is good.
Harder for the police to listen in, you see.
We should get going.
Don't want to miss the Millennium.
9... 8... 7... 6... 5...
4... 3... 2...1!
Happy New Year!
Toti?
Happy New Year.
Yeah, sure. You too.
Everything good?
I need to talk to you.
- Hey, Dagny.
- Happy New Year!
Don't you have a party
to go to downtown?
Yeah, are you guys coming?
- Stebbi can drive you. Now.
- No, no. I'm not going yet.
He's going with me later, you have
have to go. Right now. Go get your coat.
The Peru Coke.
Did you pick them up?
- Isn't it taken care of? To the Bakery?
- That's what I need to talk to you about.
- I buried the package.
- You buried it?
- The Bakery, I don't think it's safe.
- What? I'm on my way. Relax.
How do I look?
Am I pretty?
- Always.
- Cool.
Listen...
I'm going to Hamburg tomorrow.
- To Hamburg?
- Yeah, on business.
I'll be staying there a bit.
And I was wondering if
you'd maybe like to join me?
- You want me to go with you?
- Yeah.
I got plenty of cash.
I've been thinking about this...
Stebbi, it's the Millennium.
- Yeah?
- Let's talk about this later, OK?
Fuck!
Shit!
Mum? Yeah, happy New Year.
Yeah, I'm sorry,
work's been crazy busy...
I promise to come see you soon.
Mum, can you hear me?
Listen, I have a duffel bag
I'm going to send with the bus.
Just put it
in the downstairs closet? OK?
Next please.
5 YEARS LATER
After years of wandering around,
getting high, wasting time,
i was finally back home.
To pay a visit to my Mum.
Ashes to ashes...
Dust to dust...
The Lord giveth peace to the deceased
and mercy to those who are left alive.
Amen.
So that's how it is.
Dammit.
That's what's called
taking possession
of other people's belongings
without permission.
Stebbi Psycho.
Showing up at Mum's funeral.
But you were a no show
at Toti's funeral.
Even though you had your part
in his death.
That's fucking bullshit.
Stefan Kormakur Jonsson.
You know what happens
to rats that betray their friends.
Then you do the first thing that
comes to mind. No matter how crazy.
You just do it, without thinking
Fuck. You!
