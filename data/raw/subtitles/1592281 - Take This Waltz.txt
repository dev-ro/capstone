At airports.
Going from one
plane to another.
To run, to hurry

Trying ... to find ...
To wonder if

And that the flight would lose you.
No ...
this is not the fear ...
Then what are you afraid of?
I fear the stress of

Well, I am well
honestly, but ...
This ... is the feeling that
are waiting to fail ...
You look very well.
I know.
Truth. Look in
mirror and want to fuck with.
I honestly believe that I look
better than before I gave birth to Tony.
Think about it?
Yes ... You look fantastic!
- Thank you.
It is from these moments that you want
Your answer to the other immediately.
I do not think it will fail.
Do not look at me like that.
With this sincere look ...
... Like a baby fawn.
The next time you wake up
inside me vomit ...
... You should feel
guilty about you.
Then do not do it.
Do not wake up in
in your vomit.
I put my best.
On Tuesday I will close 10 months.
Very nice!
Okay, enough.

Merry.
Wait.

I will continue to
I make breakfast

how to become everything.
I did not ...
Sorry.
Howdy.
Hi!
Where are you going?
At the grocery store.
Big breakfast?
Great breakfast, start early.
You mean because both
early in the grocery store.
No, no, just woke up.
Naturally.
What does this mean
Irritable, irritable lady.
Who needs a rickshaw
at 5 am, asshole?
I go to the lake
shortly before dawn.
And then I go straight to work.
It makes no sense ...
I just do not like to
I come home in between.
- You go to the lake?
- Yes.
To think?
Yes.
- This is so gay.
- Gay?
You adelfara.
What are you? 12 years old in 1982?
Who says that word anymore?
Who go every
morning on the lake?
Ego.
The sisters.
I think I woke up early
to insult me.
You think?
Nice talking to you ...
To do it again some
time to drink coffee.
- It is a call-shot?
- What?
It is an invitation-shoot
or a normal call?
Like, "had to ask him if he wants
drink coffee sometime ...
But ... I have no
intend to do. "
Significant difference from
normal call.
No, it is a call-shot.
Okay, then,
what about now?
Let the gay office
you for me.
Stop it.
So what will you do
Now with me?
What do you mean?
To "succeed" now.
What will you do?
To "succeed" now?
Yesterday I woke up early,
and saw me leave,
I do not "succeed" anywhere.
And now with "succeed."
Now what would you do?
Nothing.
Maybe simple is good ...
Talking normally ...
between us, so ...
That things ...
not be so ...
- ... charged?
- No, I did not say "charged".
- Well.
- I never said "charged".
Got it.
Can I show you something?
Well it would seem
bit like monitoring ..
But ... you're the one
he woke up at 5.30;
to follow me,
so ...
This ...
Causes me consternation ... basically ...
All right.
I guess my answer
is, "Fuck you".
What
One side is
full of hope.
Yes, but the other side
is a junkie,
ready to fountarei
a bridge.
No, you become melodramatic.
One side does not respond
rather the full dynamics.
The one on my side, or
one side of the picture?
Well ...
And ... it was very
good idea, obviously.
You want something to drink,
or another coffee ...?
No, no, no.
- Water?
- No, I must go.
Then why not do it?
So you're an artist.
Why do not you sit?
No, I paint.
What does this mean
It means that for paint
myself, and ...
... Pay my rent,
carrying the rickshaw ...
... Through the city streets, as
bum one of the modern era.
You show your work anywhere?
No.
Why
Because I'm a coward.
These are then.
- No.
- No?
I'm not sitting.
Merry.
What about you?
I want to write.
- You do?
- Not now. Not yet.
Write, but not those
I want to write.
But yeah.
Then why ...?
What prevents you?
What's wrong with you?
General.
You look worried.
I do not mean just now ...
I mean ... in general.
I remember when my niece,
The Tony was newborn ...
Reserving the ... ...
... And sometimes crying,
as do babies, and ...
And ... I did what I could
to find the cause.
Hungry, is tired?
Has rash?
9 times out of 10 I
solve the problem, but ...
Sometimes ... I do not know ...
Sometimes ...
I walk in the street, and ...
... A ray of light illuminates a
special way the sidewalk ...
And ... I want to cry ...
And ... after a
second over.
And I decide, because
I'm an adult.
Decide not to leave
the emotional moment.
and this some thought
times with Tony.
And she just lived
such a time.
One moment he did not know
how and why
and just let herself.
And he could not do
someone something about it.
To make it better.
He was alone.
And the fact that
're alive ...
Conflict ... with this ...
Yes.
Or just do not understand
what it was.
Yes.
I guess though
this is likely.
The fact that I met you.
Seems inevitable.
I think I saw
something in your eye.
No, I think I
I saw something in your eye.
Indeed I think
I saw something in your eye.
No, I saw something
in thine eye.
It's so weird, because ...
I was so sure
that you had something!
I guess that I'm wrong
got something in your eye.
Come on.
All right.
Lou!
We need to see this.
With rain and cold water.
Lou?
Yes?
- Do you have a job?
- Yes.
No.
I want to zoulixo until
I leave all the snot ..
I want to be raped
with scissors ...
Until they die ...
by bleeding.
Very far fetched.
Much? No, it was
far fetched
Will scratch the
grater for the potatoes.
Is that all?
This is silly.
It's scary!
Not in the grater

And I'm sure James does not

Love in marriage.
Somewhat depressing.
Sometimes I think,

And then ...
I kissed your eyelids ...
Flickered ... and,
beneath my lips.
- A little.
- A little ...
And ... much too late ...
I touched his lips ...
I with mine.
But because you're married,
I did not dare to kiss.

Instead, I went
slowly into your throat ...
And ... I kissed every inch of.
And I stopped for a while ...
Sign ... to have
on your left shoulder.
Yeah, that.
And ...
In ... smelled.
Inhale and smell.
How do I smell?
You smell like you.

It takes courage to
"Seductions" your husband?
Yes.
He wants all
courage the world.
This is ridiculous.
Is it?
Then why prove it
