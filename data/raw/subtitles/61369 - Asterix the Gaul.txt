Two thousand years ago and more,
Julius Caesar came, saw and...
conquered the land of the Gauls
after a long and bitter struggle.
The resistance was led by Vercingetorige.
This valiant young leader...
was forced to lay down his arms
at the feet of Caesar.
lt's an historical fact that Caesar had
a lot of Gaul but he didn't have it all.
One little region held out.
A fortified village surrounded by the...
entrenched Romans and it is in this
village that we shall meet the hero...
of our tale, the mighty warrior Asterix.
There he is now, about to go hunting
for wild boar, their habit.
You'll be back soon Asterix ?
- Yes l'll be back in time for dinner.
Ah something tells me there are
Romans around here.
What hit me ?
- The Gaul keeper's key.
The occupation of Gaul as we see
was no Roman holiday.
And one sweet morning the legion
leader , Bonus Belonus, was meditating.
Hail Bonus Belonus !
The patrol is back.
Hail Patroleum, lets hear the report !
- Hail Bonus Belonus.
By Jupiter, how did you men get so
badly beaten, were you outnumbered ?
Well, were we outnumbered ?
- Outnumbered ? l wouldn't say that.
There was a boy.
And he wasn't too big either.
By Jupiter there is a deep
secret to the Gaelic strength.
Well Asterix, anything special happened ?
- Oh no, oh yes, l crowned four Romans.
That all ?
- Obelix, how would you like some boar ?
Oh sure, just got a couple
of these to drop off.
Yum yum roast boars.
l guess the Romans were furious.
They are going to attack us
again you'll see.
Why worry as long as Panoramix
can cook up his magic potion.
That reminds me this is my ration day,
let's go see the old Druid.
Come along Obelix ?
- You know we mustn't waste food.
Hear that ! That's him cutting
mistletoe with his golden sickle.
Panoramix, Druid ?
What's the matter Panoramix ?
- You scared me, you made me...
cut my finger with my sickle.
- Sorry,l've come to get my potion.
Shhh, it's a secret, come with me !
With stirring motion l mix the potion
that gives us our magic powers.
The magic potion that increases
your strength a thousand fold.
Exactly what do you put
into that potion, oh druid ?
The origin of the potion is lost
in the darkness of the ages.
A Druid can only repeat the secret
to another druid, all that l can tell you...
is that it contains mistletoe and lobster,
the lobster is not necessary...
but it tastes good.
Can l have some too ?
- No Obelix, no no you know you can't !
You fell into the potion when
you were just a baby and the effects...
of the potion on you
are permanent, you know that.
Why don't you try out the effects
of the potion for us ?
Sure here l go.
lt works, old druid it works.
Those poor poor Romans,
how sorry l feel for them.
And now lets see
what the Romans are up to.
And in spite of our siege,
these Gauls go on defying us !
lf they are going to fight
one against four it isn't fair !
We have to find out their secret .
- You're right Marcus Sufrus.
l must have a volunteer, who will
go and spy on the Gauls ?
With so many volunteers l 'll
decide by playing musical chairs.
This game which has come to us
down through the ages.
lt was played with one chair less
than there were legionnaires ...
when the music stopped...
lt's Caligolaminus !
lt's Caligolaminus ! lt's Caligolaminus !
No no l won't go
- Caesar will reward you Caligolaminus.
No not me !
Either you volunteer
or l will feed you to the lions.
lf you insist, l'll go.
- Make a Gaul out of Caligolaminus.
Meanwhile in the Gaelic village...
Men it's a long time now since we last
heard from the Romans, that's a bad sign.
We must be vigilant and remember
to get your ration of the potion.
Hooray for Tunabrix, our chief !
Hooray for Tunabrix, our chief !
Chief ! Chief !
- Yes Obelix ?
Panoramix won't give me any potion,
that's not fair. Because l feel weak.
You weak ?
- Oh my oh my, here comes Stopthemusic !
l shall now sing a lay
in honour of Gaelic courage !
Barbarians, they can't
appreciate my art.
Caligolaminus is now ready !
- Good, lets go and see.
Put him in chains.
You're going for a stroll near the village
of the Gauls, when the Gauls see you ...
they'll rescue you, when you'll be within
their gates, you'll learn their secret.
Now how do you like my plan ?
- Well just between us l don't understand.
Take him to the enemy.
- Take it easy, easy man easy !
l'm a real Roman, l'm a Roman, hey !
l'd like to get into a good fight.
- Yeah but don't count on it Asterix.
The Romans are staying close to their
camp, they're tired of getting beat.
What's that ?
The sound of chains
Somebody's arriving, up the tree.
How long are we going
to have to walk like this.
Shut up, you'll be the only one spared
when the Gauls attack, don't forget !
Romans coming, they've got a Gaul.
- Let's save him !
l feel better.
Let's we wake them up and start again.
No come on, it's getting late.
- Come along little fellow.
Mission accomplished.
Well lets take off his chains.
- But you can't do it without tools.
Tools ? Who needs tools ?
Well who are you ?
- l'm Cali... Caligoliminix.
l live in Lutetia.
But the Romans and Gauls
live in peace there, don't they ?
Well in their eyes l appear so foxy,
that they think l am a spy.
The Romans take you for a spy ?
Are they stupid ?
The heroic patrol, commanded by
Marcus Sufrus returns to the camp.
At HamsweetHam.
Oh hail, the Gauls came they saw
and they freed Caligolaminus.
What a great victory for us !
l hope that Caligolaminus will come
back to us in a single piece.
l hope so for him otherwise
l'll grind his pieces to pieces.
And throw him to the lions.
Poor Caligolaminus.
We're approaching the village, there
you'll be safe. There's only us Gauls.
Oh great !
Asterix and Obelix they brought company !
- l wonder who it is.
You'll have to meet our
chief, the great Tunabrix.
Where are the Romans ? Let me at them !
Where are the Romans ?
Here we are !
l bid you welcome brother and
l hope you'll feel at home.
Well, thanks.
And now l shall carol a song of welcome.
Stroll around the village till supper.
- All right.
l'll find out what sort of tools
these Gauls use to work their metal.
Hey come on Obelix , that stone !
- Here it is, coming right up.
Gosh They really are strong !
There must be a secret to this power.
Hey Caligoliminix ! Supper's ready !
Roast boar.
- Roast boar ?
ls there a secret to your
super human strength ?
Yup, but we can't tell it.
Why don't you eat ?
lt'll get cold otherwise.
Why can't you tell me what the secret is ?
- Because it's a secret.
lt's not fair !
lf we Gauls can't share
our secrets, what's the use ?
lf l was as strong as you l could get past
the Roman line and get back to my home.
What do you say ?
- Well l say lets finish his roast boar.
My relatives are probably worried.
- Well lets go and see the Druid.
Panoramix ! Panoramix !
What do you want now Asterix ?
Me, nothing, but our new friend
want to know why we're so strong.
lts absolutely out of the question.
But l have to get home
to get back to work.
What do you work at ?
l'm a guide, l guide for Lutetia
by night. National tourism.
No ! No ! And No !
All right, l get it, you don't want me.
l'll get to Lutetia anyway and
if the Romans throw me to the lions...
at each bite l'll say,
''You can blame Panoramix the Druid !
You can blame Panoramix the Druid !
You can blame Panoramix the Druid !
Oh Well, all right !
- Come back Caligoliminix !
Come back, Caligoliminix !
l'll show you the secret of our power,
l'll even give you a portion of a potion.
lt's a secret you can drink ?
- Go call the others Asterix.
lt's a secret you can drink ?
- Go call the others Asterix.
Get your magic potion !
Come and get your potion !
Come and get your potion !
Magic ?
- Potion ?
Come and get your potion !
- Magic ?
Potion ?
- The magic potion ?
A portion of this potion, can give you
the necessary strength to return...
to Lutetia but the effects of it
disappear quickly.
lt tastes like vegetable soup.
- l can make it taste like other things...
lamb barbecue, clam chowder,
cheese omelette, steak and onions...
But l don't feel anything special.
- Why don't you try lifting up that rock ?
But l will never be able to.
Hey little fellow, you have
to be careful anyway.
What are we going to do now ?
- Were going to dance.
Lets the dance now begin !
Take your places !
Step to the right !
Step to the left !
Left row forward, right row back !
Mark your places,
reach your partner.
Pull your partners moustache !
Pull your partners moustache !
These are removable moustaches,
They are the latest style in Lutetia.
Your are no Gaul,
you're a Roman spy.
Get the Roman !
lt's no use Asterix, remember
he just drank the potion.
lt's because of you that he escapes.
By my golden sickle, you are the one
who insisted that l give him some.
Lets forget it, he didn't learn much
and the effect will disappear soon.
Hail Bonus Belonus !
l've learnt the secret of the Gauls.
lt's a magic potion.
Where is this potion ?
- Here here here !
Come along Caligolaminus, l want to see
what effects this potion produces.
Fight them !
Fight them !
l said fight them !
- Him ? Fight us ? By Jupiter, he can't !
We'll make mincemeat out of them.
That's that !
Wonderful ! Trouble is we don't
have the potion to study !
l suggest we cut him open
just like a rabbit.
You just try it, come on you just try it.
Your idea isn't bad, but
Caligolaminus refused to cooperate.
Sure l refuse !
How long is the potion effective ?
How long ? l don't know.
All right, lift that rock.
There you are.
What a man ! Now don't move, when
that rock gets too heavy for you ...
it'll mean the effects of the potion
have completely disappeared.
Much much later...
Well now, you don't feel quite so strong ?
- No not quite.
lf l can find out what's in that potion,
l can become emperor, Bonus Caesar.
We leave Bonus Belonus to his
dreams and return to the Gauls.
l'm going to gather mistletoe.
- Do you want me to come along ?
No Asterix, you stay here and
protect the village, your strength is ...
due to my potion but your intelligence
was yours from the day you were born.
Anyhow l won't be very long.
All right.
You Roman nincompoops !
We've captured the Druid, Bonus Belonus.
- Bravo, Julius Octopus, as a reward...
you can have a pass to go
to Rome and see the circus.
Rome, l'm going to the circus !
Rome, l'm going to the circus !
Druid tell me your secret.
- The secret ? Not on your life.
This man must talk, get me the torturer.
We'll see if he'll talk or not.
Cough !
Come on druid ! We've been torturing
you for hours and it hasn't helped.
lt has helped me pass the time.
- Speak, l'll make you powerful and rich !
No !
You will have lots and lots of money.
No
The magical powers of this Druid
are much too strong for me.
And he's so stubborn,
a stubborn as a mule.
What's the matter Asterix ?
You look worried.
The Druid went to gather mistletoe
and he hasn't come back.
l'm going to go and find him.
- Be careful Asterix !
You had your potion a long time ago.
- Well l'll just have to trust my brain.
Panoramix !
Druid, where are you ?
Panoramix !
Panoramix !
Panoramix !
Don't worry, don't sell your oxen.
- Then what ?
Just sell your cart .
- What ?
Just sell your cart and go
home with your oxen.
What a brilliant idea that is !
Stop, stop enough !
Tell me, have you seen
a Druid gathering mistletoe ?
No but l did see one being carried
in a net, a group of legionnaires.
They were taking him to HamSweetham.
What ? You take me to Hamsweetham.
- But that is a way out of my way !
Hamsweetham is the biggest market
around and it has a great used cart park.
How lucky for me to have met you,
Hamsweetham, here we come.
Why are you hiding ?
- To play a joke on my Roman pals.
That's great, l love jokes.
This jackass should get
the laurel wreath for stupidity.
What are you carrying in your cart ?
- Nothing.
By Jupiter, are you laughing at me ?
What is going on here Cracsus Daris ?
This sap is laughing at me,
l'll have to check his cart.
Let him enter, l know him
he's not dangerous.
That idiot had almost got me caught.
Here we are in camp, are you going
to play your joke now ?
lt's dark, ln the morning it'll be funnier.
- Oh sure.
Goodnight...
l better start looking for the
Druid, lets start there.
Lie down and dine, oh Marcus,
my loyal right-hand. We must talk.
Thank you Oh gracious Bonus.
We must get the secret recipe the
Druid has for the potion, understand ?
And when we do we shall march
on Rome and take the place of Caesar.
Julius Caesar ?
Right friend, Jules, and the two of us
will form a powerful triumvirate.
l have need of him now but later
in Rome, l'll be the triumphant.
l'll have him eaten by a lion in Rome,
l shall become Caesar, just me, all alone.
This is very interesting but it doesn't
help me find Panoramix the Druid.
Oh he's certainly being
guarded in that tent.
l beg your pardon, l've come
to free Panoramix, my friend.
Don't let him get out,
he's an unconquerable Gaul.
l'll go get some help.
- Sure go.
Asterix !
- How are you ?
Have you gone mad ? Why did you come
here you've walked into the lions den.
Chief ! Chief !
These asses can't do a thing
against my magical powers.
l know that, lets have some fun,
with them, l 've got a few ideas.
Chief ! Chief !
Oh Bonus Belonus
- What now ?
We've captured a Gal, G, Gaul
in the t, tent of the D, D Druid.
We need reinforcements
or the prisoner is sure to get away.
By the great Jupiter,
sound off the alarm !
Surrender, you Gauls, if not l'll order
my brave legionaries to attack you.
l hope he surrenders.
The suspense is killing me.
l toss my weapon at your feet as
Vercingetorige, my chief, tossed his ...
at Caesar's feet, come on, l'm
surrendering. l've got no time to waste !
Seize that Gaul or l'll have
you all fed to the lions.
Lions ?
- Fed to the lions he said !
- And he means it too.
Hey what's happening ?
The camps been invaded by a Gaul.
- Well that's not fair, he might have
waited will l woke up to begin his joke.
He doesn't play fair, it's not nice !
So you refuse to speak, do you Druid ?
But tomorrow on the torture rack ...
your friend may be a bit more gracious !
They've no idea how loquacious l'll be.
l'll break the record for loquacit
Shh they're coming !
Bonus Belonus wants to see you.
You, do you know the
secret of the magic potion ?
Me ? No !
- For the last time Druid...
give me the recipe for the magic potion
or l'll have your friend tortured.
You can't scare me Roman.
- l trust in the courage of my friend.
Well, we shall see, l want this Gaul tied
to that table, and go get the torturer.
Here l am, you know my
motto, always ready.
Pity please, don't hurt me,
l can't take anymore !
Enough, l can't see him
suffer like this, l'll tell you all.
Torturer, desist !
But chief l didn't even get started.
Oh pity please, pity please !
OK druid, let me in on the secret,
if not l'll have him finish the job.
l'll prepare the potion in front of you
but l need a number of ingredients...
that l can only find in the forest.
- What scared-i cats these Gauls are !
You will have what you need, go with him
l will hold the other Gaul as a hostage.
l'll need mistletoe...
herbs and a few roots,
and some flowers.
The Druid is back.
- Now he wants a big pot.
Then give him one !
Just a pinch of salt, a tiny touch
of pepper and let it bubble.
Bubble ? Bubble oh make it bubble fast.
- Something is lacking.
An ingredient that is important,
- What ? What ? What ?
Strawberries.
- Strawberries at this season ?
Of course it won't be that easy,
we could wait until the right season.
No, send out our fastest messengers,
l want strawberries, strawberries !
Strawberries, strawberries !
Asterix, you get good ideas.
- You are the one who thought of ...
sending them strawberry picking,
while we lounge at Caesar's expense.
The messengers have been gone for
days, not a single one has returned.
The messengers have come back !
- That's fine.
Hail Bonus Belonus.
- Hail my legionaries, did you find them ?
No, no sir !
- No strawberries Bonus.
- And we lost Julius Octopus.
Here l am Bonus Belonus, look l found
the strawberry, l ran into a route...
merchant just back from Greece,
l had to pay their weight in gold !
That's good, you shall have a reward,
l grant you a pass to Rome and you've...
my permission to go to the circus.
- l'm going to the circus !
Druid, here are the strawberries
you needed for your magic potion.
What do you think of them Asterix ?
- l'm not sure they are of fine quality.
Could be worse.
l've changed my opinion
they are excellent.
Yes, just what l needed for my potion,
send for another basket.
l've had about enough, you're
driving me mad, you're not being fair.
All right, all right, take it easy,
don't cry l'll prepare your potion.
Stop crying, he'll prepare it.
- Sure, l'll make it without strawberries.
Of course it won't be as sweet.
- Anyhow strawberries ...
can give you a rash.
lt's ready, it's best to serve it hot.
- l'll be first.
Where is the proof that your potion
is not a poison, by Jupiter ?
l'll be happy to taste it
first if you are afraid.
No, if this potion is the real one
it will increase your power ...
and you will become invincible.
l want a volunteer !
l said l am calling for a volunteer.
Oh Bonus Belonus, don't risk the life
of a legionnaire, try the potion ...
on some ordinary person
for the experiment.
Good idea !
You come over here, friend.
- Who me ?
Are you well, my good friend ?
- No l am not, l was told l could sell ...
my cart but no one wants
to buy it, and it is all his fault !
l don't quite get what you mean but for
consolation you may have some of this.
No thanks, l don't drink.
Drink it !
Why are you looking at me ? Didn't you
ever see a cart dealer taking a drink ?
After drinking this potion,
you are the worlds strongest man.
Me ?
You're so funny, he's a big joker.
We'll find that out, punch somebody !
- But l'm not mad at anybody.
A volunteer
for a good wallop !
l would like a bit more enthusiasm
when l call for a volunteer.
Me, l'll volunteer.
- You, that's an idea By Jupiter.
Go on !
- Go ahead hit him !
Go on, hit him !
- Hit him, you fool !
By Jupiter, its absolutely marvellous.
Did it hurt much ?
- l thought the sky dropped on my head.
Well you don't need me
anymore so, l guess l'll go.
That potion is simply,
that is its magic.
Forward, come and get your magic potion.
The road to Rome lies before us,
oh Marcus, Caesar's days are numbered.
You Druid, you write down the
recipe of the magic potion.
They will be cooked once it is in our
possession, that will teach them a lesson.
A good idea yes.
Let us tryout our great new strength.
l'm trying to over do it.
l'll try that boulder.
A smaller one.
l'm strong, l am a superman !
What great power !
- Yes ?
Bonus Belonus ?
- Yes ?
There is no powers
in lifting that little stone.
You're right !
So you tricked me you Gauls,
this potion is not magic.
Yes it is !
Oh Bonus Belonus, lets settle
the hash of these Gauls.
How dare you appear
before me without shaving ?
A good legionnaire
should be clean shaven !
You are right but a legionnaire
leader should set an example.
But, what, what is gong on ?
- Look at them !
What's happening here Druid ?
- lt's an old formulae for a hair growing...
lotion, an extremely powerful one, the
hair on you heads and on your face...
will grow and grow
with the fastest pace.
l will have you killed.
Give me the anti-dote for this.
lf you kill us who will make the antidote
for you ? We are a little bit tired today.
- Yes, we are going to retire to our tent.
Hey you two ! Wait, hey !
What's wrong oh Bonus Belonus ?
l caught my foot in my beard, imbecile !
l am at the mercy of these Gauls,
l'll have to bargain with them.
Three thousand and seventy five.
- What ?
lt's a new game we invented, one who sees
a beard gets 15 points, 10 000 wins.
You've got your goal, you Gaul,
well what do you want ?
Promise not to split hairs about it ?
- Don't you mention hairs again, you hear ?
That's for the beards.
- No wait, please.
All right but don't get in my hair again.
Oh to be exact to
a hair we'll listen !
All right, l give up, just give me the
antidote and l'll let you go free.
Well you see l don't feel very
much feel like working now.
He gets a hand for being hair brained.
You wouldn't think
he's just had a close shave.
All right, all right don't get so upset,
l'll do it. l'll have to go out again and...
get all the ingredients in the forest.
Yes but with an escort.
Why did you accept so fast,
he's up to no good.
The effects of the potion l laid down
aren't going to last very long.
Tomorrow there won't be any beards,
so we had better try to get out of here.
As soon as l'm rid of this long hair
and this beard, l'll murder those Gauls.
lt will give me a riotous satisfaction.
We have come to escort you to the forest
to gather the ingredients for the potion.
l have a plan.
- That's great, we've got a million idea.
You will keep off my beard.
Keep your beard off from under my feet.
Come on hurry, our beards keep growing.
l think that now l have got
pretty much what is necessary.
lt's only us.
- That's fine, well get to work.
l've been working all morning, l hope
l will be able to take a rest sometime.
Where are you going ?
- Can l see him prepare the anti -dote ?
No, better not, you would hinder us,
you are too nervous.
You guards, watch this tent,
see to it they don't escape.
Well that's good, you see Asterix,
in the small pot l have prepared ...
our real magic potion, l think we will
need your muscles if we are to get out ...
of here and here in the big pot
l have prepared the anti dote.
water, salt, vegetables and a marrow
bone, since we have to taste it in front...
of the Romans l thought
you would like something good.
The magic potion is ready,
might as well take a good portion.
All right now call our bearded hosts.
Hey Romans, soups on !
You bring that pot out here.
- All right, all right.
You taste it first.
ls it good ?
- lt's fine but l like it with more salt.
lt's your turn Bonus Belonus.
How can we really be sure that this potion
keeps the hair from growing longer ?
You really are clever, watch my moustache
you will see, it has stopped growing.
By Jupiter, it is true, drink men.
They swim like swine.
- Yes.
Now my guards, seize those two Gauls.
- The pleasure is mine.
Not by the hair of your chinny chin chin.
Let me go, please let me go, help me.
Run, we'll leave while they
are picking up the pieces.
l was just starting to have some fun.
- Halt you, get back in there.
Romans !
More Romans !
Many more !
More there ! We are surrounded.
Reinforcements, they got here
just in time, what luck.
lt's not so good.
Now l've got you Gauls,
l'll have you eaten by the lions.
Oh Bonus Belonus, you are
awaited in your tent, it's urgent.
Urgent ?
- Yes urgent.
Who's cloak is this littering my tent ?
Remnant of Caesar, that which is Caesar.
Julius Caesar ?
- ln person.
l have come to find out what you
are been doing about he Gauls.
And I want to know what has been
going on here to keep your garrison...
from receiving me with all due honour.
Well you see, l mean, we have been
fighting what l mean is with some Gauls.
Fighting with Gauls ? How many Gauls ?
- Two.
By Cleopatra, show me the two man who
are capable of standing up against...
a garrison of my legionaries.
Well so there are the terrible Gauls ?
Tell me just what happened here ?
Caesar, Bonus Belonus was trying
to steal our magic potion so he...
would be invincible. He intended
to become emperor.
Well, well
- Oh well, let me explain...
You need not bother, and go and shave
will you ? You and your men will be...
leaving for Mongolia, there're other
barbarians there who tried to oust me.
But l could explain everything.
- And as for you, in exchange for the
services you have rendered l shall...
allow you your liberty, but
we will meet before long, Gauls.
l'll count on that Caesar.
By the Gods here they are.
Hooray Panoramix, Hooray Tunabricks
our chief hooray Asterix,
Let us rejoice because our brothers
have reached a decisive new victory.
Hooray for Tunabricks our chief.
Let the festivities start.
Under a star studded sky, the little
fortified village of brave Gauls
celebrated one more victory. Obtained
through the protection of their Gods.
lntelligence, magic and courage,
they knew the future would bring them ...
further victories over
the Roman legions.
