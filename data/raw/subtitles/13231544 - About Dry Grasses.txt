About Dry Grasses
Here.
This is for you.
Thanks. What is it?
The olive oil you liked.
- From the farm?
- Yes, cold pressed.
Thanks.
Did you go anywhere on holiday?
No. How could I?
Lots of trouble at the village.
My dad got worse again.
Hospital and injections.
With my mother it's another story.
She's all upset.
About what?
Because I'm not married.
Same old story.
But she's really out of control now.
Sulking, cross. Even got sick.
Really?
Spent holiday in bed because of that.
As if there was a decent girl
and I didn't like her!
Be careful, they want to tax bachelors.
Stop it.
Believe me, my holiday was exhausting.
- Welcome back, sir.
- Thanks.
- Welcome back.
- Thanks, thanks.
Cut it out, boy!
- Good morning.
- Yeah, good morning.
Well, well, well!
The teacher of teachers, welcome!
Hey, Nail, how's things?
Fine, fine.
Came back to the coral, huh?
Yeah, what else can you do?
- Is everyone here?
- They are.
- Hey, Samet!
- Yes?
I got new chickens.
From now on, you can get eggs from me.
Okay, we'll see.
Tell the others, okay?
Alright.
Hi.
Welcome back.
Is this all of us?
We're not enough for you, Samet?
With you here,
how could it not be enough?
Firdevs the Great!
That's right!
Just don't want to be the sucker
who showed up on time.
No, everyone's here.
It was so hard for me to
get out of bed today.
We get used to being lazy so quickly,
don't we?
- Right.
- Bekir isn't here?
Hofe's in his office. Had breakfast?
I haven't and probably won't.
If Firdevs isn't eating, me neither.
She knows why.
Stop teasing me.
Give me the other one, Nail.
- Try the honey.
- From your home town?
My brother's hives.
- Morning all. Bon appétit.
- Good morning.
There's a cigarette butt in my cup.
Nail, what the hell?
Must be the plumbers
during the holidays.
Had I seen, I'd have stopped them.
That's outrageous.
They even
took the broken taps with them!
Outrageous.
Come sit down. The food's almost gone.
- Here's your tea.
- Thank you.
Nail says he has eggs.
Did he tell you too?
What's up, Samet?
Are you getting a commission?
This job doesn't pay enough.
What else can I do?
His kid's away at high school.
He needs help.
Sorry, I can't eat
this local stuff anymore.
You buy perfume
from peddlers. Why not eggs?
What do you mean?
The perfumes were originals.
I swear. They really were.
I checked the internet.
I would never buy fakes.
I checked too.
They sell things
left behind at airports.
So they're originals.
When did you
find all this stuff out, Kenan?
The guy wasn't lying.
What's he doing with original perfumes
out here in nowhere?
- Doesn't sound right to me.
- Why not?
His tracksuits were fake.
But he told us they were fake.
Only after he found out
I'm a sports teacher.
How could he know
you're a sports teacher?
Because he saw me in a tracksuit.
Why would he hide it?
He can sell tracksuits, too.
The man showed a little honesty
to make you believe a bigger lie.
A tracksuit counts.
- How do you know?
- Well, how do you know?
Alright, it's original.
It was original.
I get allergies otherwise.
Morning. That's quite a spread.
Who prepared these?
Kevser did, bless her.
What about the schedule?
Bekir's preparing it now.
He'll be here soon.
Take your old classes again for today.
Here's notebooks.
Then we'll see.
Very funny. But you didn't scare me.
You're lying. I saw you flinch.
Me, flinch?
You shrunk back.
That's not fear.
That's just a reflex.
It's the same, sir.
Alright, have it your way.
Here, this is for you.
It's heavy. I nearly threw it away.
Oh, so beautiful.
- You like it?
- A mirror!
Look at it later at home.
Thanks very much.
Don't worry, I won't show anyone.
Sir.
You said you had an extra bedstead
that you wanted to give away.
- You still have it?
- Yes.
I know someone who needs it.
Who?
Emirhan in the 8th grade.
It's in the basement.
But let me check first. Okay?
Now off to class.
The teacher's here.
Come on, sit down.
Right, enough. Everyone sit down.
Don't throw the markers on the floor.
Pick them up.
They keep getting lost.
Put their caps on.
Sit down.
Holiday's over.
Yes, sir, it's over.
How was it?
Good.
Mine wasn't.
Did you miss school?
Hey, what's going on?
Holiday's over.
It's a new semester.
Yes.
I'm your class teacher again.
Okay.
If you have any problems, come to me.
Alright.
But not for nonsense,
like "my friend hit me", okay?
But sir, he keeps kicking me.
He won't anymore.
But he does.
Welcome back.
C'mon, I'm gonna see Vahit.
I tried calling over the holidays.
They cut my phone cause of the bill.
Don't need it anyway.
I can't even pay you back yet,
but I will soon.
Forget it.
And the security job?
It was a bunch of lies.
They'd rather get a dog than hire me.
I was stupid to get my hopes up.
They were right.
Why hire a terrorist like you?
For sure.
Welcome back, teacher.
Come, there's tea brewing
at headquarters.
But I'll be gone soon anyhow.
I might have a job in a nightclub.
Where?
In Varto.
There's a nightclub in Varto?
- Good money?
- Whatever they pay is fine.
Good thing I gave up smoking
or I'd be
collecting butts in the streets.
You're still in the twilight zone then.
Fine, go.
I'll come fucking visit.
Where've you been, motherfucker?
Why would I come here
when it's full of lowlifes?
That was two hours ago.
Asshole.
Don't piss me off.
Seref, three teas.
Forget tea.
Fetch what's behind the boxes.
I'd fetch you a punch in the face,
but it'd be rude to the teacher.
Welcome, by the way.
Thanks.
I say to him,
"I'll pay you. Get those boxes down."
Say that when no one's around, then.
What are you talking about?
Was I supposed to kick them out?
Unbelievable, he can't make it over here
in 20 minutes.
When there's whisky and stuff,
he's here in a sec.
Stop going on and fucking bring it out.
It's gone. Finished.
Shouldn't have ordered tea for me.
Can't go without having tea. No way.
He'll have tea at army headquarters.
No way. I'm not going there.
He can drink both here and there.
We're wine people.
Forget about whisky. It's not for
lefties like you.
What's this? Like a fairy chimney. Wow.
But it's all made in factories now.
They say it tastes the same.
- No problem. Wine's wine.
- Fill it up.
There's a bunch of mangy dogs
around the school.
Can't we do something?
They won't harm the kids.
I don't mean the kids, but the dogs.
Poor things. They scratch all day long.
You see how people live here.
How do you expect anyone to
care about the dogs
when no one cares about people?
That's right, but...
You start caring
about every living thing,
you won't last long here, my friend.
Did you always not give a fuck
or is it just now in the army?
What do you mean, sir?
Fill these out and
bring them back to me. Okay?
Yes, sir.
If I'm not here, give them to
whoever's in charge.
Yes, sir.
Well, Erdi?
I put it here.
Did I ask you that?
Someone must've moved it.
Did I ask you that?
I don't understand.
Did I ask you that?
Were you always a lazy fucker
or is it just now in the army?
Maybe someone moved it.
Answer my fucking question.
Yes, sir, I always was.
What were you, Erdi?
A lazy fucker, sir.
Good job,
you told the truth. Go get us tea.
Yes, sir.
I love when a man tells the truth.
Really. He's a great kid.
Welcome back again.
Tell me what you've been up to.
How was it?
It was nice to go home.
But it's the same old routine.
- Good.
- What about you?
We don't get holidays like you.
We hang around here.
We went to Erzurum once.
The kids kept going on
about the shopping mall.
Otherwise nothing.
Hey, Berkcan, your thing is sorted.
I talked to them.
Really? Thank you, sir.
It wasn't easy, but I managed it.
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate it.
Go on, carry on with your work.
And shut the door.
We have a female sergeant here,
named Dilek.
I think you'd be right for each other.
Don't laugh like that.
I want to introduce you.
No, no way.
Why do you say no flat out?
Meet her, get to know her, text her.
If you don't like her, no problem.
Who knows, it could lead to marriage.
What are you doing? I'm still young.
Stop being so shy. Take action.
- I'm not shy.
- Wait a minute.
What are you doing? Stop it.
Wait a minute.
I'll ask her to come. Hello?
No. Leave it.
I'm telling you I'm not interested.
I don't believe it.
You're crazy, you know.
Fine, but you're always hanging out
with the wrong people.
Why?
The other day we were checking IDs
in the tea house.
That guy, the one I just saw you with.
He's got an attitude.
"Why do I have to show ID
in my hometown?"
I told him to cut the crap.
It's a routine check. Shut up.
Really? So?
So, nothing.
He fucking showed it of course.
The guy's an asshole.
Seriously.
All the losers around
here end up at our door.
You really have your work cut out.
You don't know the half of it.
The other day,
some guy calls the station stranded
on the road.
Had to go in the middle of the night,
find gas and fill his tank.
Really?
Better believe it.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- It's Nuray, isn't it?
- Yes.
- I hope you didn't wait long.
- No, it's fine.
Have a seat.
Would you like tea or coffee?
I'd like a weak tea.
Thanks.
Weak enough?
That's fine.
Sugar's here.
Thanks.
Your school's pretty big.
Had to ask my way to the canteen.
Yes, large for this region perhaps.
Compared to our dump, everywhere seems
like Paris to me.
- Which village?
- Incesu.
Never been,
but it must be harder than here.
Of course.
How long have you been there?
This is my fourth year.
- Enough for a transfer.
- Yes.
Are you going to ask for one?
You kidding?
From the day I arrived,
I've only thought about leaving.
- Where to?
- Istanbul.
It can't be easy for you here either,
after all that time in Ankara.
That's right.
But your family's here,
I guess. That's good.
Sercan said something like that.
Yes.
You live with them or something.
Sercan told you
a lot about me, it seems.
No, not really.
Don't get the wrong idea.
He knows I'm here.
He insisted I call,
said we'd get on well.
You draw too, I guess?
I'm just an amateur.
Community education level.
That's great. Really.
I studied it at school, now I teach it.
So I'm an art teacher,
but I haven't drawn in a long time.
I'm lazy, I guess.
But sometimes I take photos.
I head out into the wild,
things like that.
That's nice.
Come on, teacher.
Thanks.
Get a bit closer to the horse.
Bow your head a little.
Like this. Okay.
Bow your head a bit more.
Turn it this way.
Look at me, into the lens.
I'm taking it now.
Today we study portraits.
- What's that?
- Quiet.
People's faces. Today you'll draw this.
That's really hard, sir.
It doesn't have to be exactly the same.
Do your best. Change it if you have to.
Try to add your own touch.
We always draw the same things.
Mountains, rocks, snow, donkeys.
You draw the things you know well.
What more do you want?
Wouldn't it be better
if we drew the sea?
The sea? What for?
Would be nice. The sea and sun.
But how will you draw things
you don't know well?
But we do know them.
How? Any of you seen the sea?
Where did you see it?
On TV, sir.
I don't mean that.
I mean in real life.
Yes, Delila.
I visited my aunt in Izmir.
- You saw it there.
- Yes.
- Did you go in?
- Yes.
Fine. Okay.
We can draw the sea as well.
I'll check my photos, then maybe we can.
do what you like.
What's the name of the sea at Izmir?
Anyone know?
What's it called? Tell me Aylin.
Aegean Sea, sir.
Well done, dear.
What other seas are there?
Tell me, Sevim.
Marmara Sea, Mediterranean, Black Sea.
Good job. Bravo.
It's always the same.
Something wrong, Bilal?
You always ask Sevim and her friends.
What's that mean?
From the start of the first semester,
you've always asked them.
So what if I do?
It's a kind of discrimination.
Don't talk nonsense.
You fool. Be smart.
- But you always...
- Shut up!
Be careful when you talk to me.
Don't take advantage because I'm nice.
Behave yourself.
Finish drawing.
Can we draw something else?
Draw whatever you want.
I'll get the Honda.
The Honda. I want to buy it.
- Really?
- Yeah, life's short.
Has he dropped the price?
No, but I looked into it.
It's worth it.
- I see you've made up your mind.
- Yeah.
It's cheap even.
Then buy it and relax.
Buy it. Yeah.
- We'll drive around.
- Yeah, sure.
What's up, girls?
Aylin wants to call her dad
about staying for study period.
Study period? Never mind about that.
Don't let anyone
touch these volleyballs.
You're usually here.
- Send them to me.
- Alright.
They say volleyball
but keep playing football.
Alright. Is your eye better?
- Yes.
- Here you are.
Thank you.
Sir, Ibrahim fell off the slide.
Really? How?
He was walking on it.
He deserved it then,
if he was walking on it.
Whoa!
What have you done, girl?
You've made a mess.
What class do you have?
Social studies.
Mr. Kenan is so boring.
How can you share a house with him?
Shush. You shouldn't talk like that.
But it's true.
- Did your dad say yes?
- Yes.
Okay.
Can you let me
and Aylin out of class now?
No way. Come on, get to class.
Mr. Kenan doesn't do anything anyway.
He just shows dumb videos.
That's right.
What more do you want?
Would you rather take notes for an hour?
No, but...
Come on, get to class.
- But...
- Out of my sight!
Don't talk about
your teachers like that.
Come on, off to class now.
What's up?
Let's go get water from the hill.
Come on.
Let's get some spring water.
Right. If we have to suffer here,
let's at least take advantage of that.
Exactly.
Look.
Who's that?
Is that her?
Yeah, I told you.
I met her the other day.
Did you take that?
No, it's her Instagram account.
She's pretty.
Not bad.
- Want to meet her?
- What?
I can introduce you.
Why?
I think you'd get on.
You'd suit each other.
Why?
I don't know, you just would.
You're both from here.
You're both teachers.
What does she teach?
English.
Nice.
You could learn English as well.
You always wanted to.
And you're both Alawis.
That's not important.
Maybe not for you and me,
but it is for families.
And she's smart, and intelligent.
She does drawing and stuff.
If she's so great,
why don't you date her?
I'm leaving here, man.
Besides, I don't want to get married.
You're the one who wants to, right?
That's true.
Your mother will be happy.
You said she was upset about it.
Well, yeah.
I'll sort it out this year, anyway.
Don't think I'm not interested
cause of her leg.
It doesn't matter to me at all.
You don't even really notice.
She's just got a slight limp.
It doesn't matter to me, either.
Maybe it's even better.
How?
You know.
Let me see.
We won't be silent.
She's left-wing, I guess.
Yeah, she's pretty.
She's really pretty.
Good morning.
We're doing a quick search.
Girls line up at the board.
Boys to the back wall.
- Hurry up. Don't waste time.
- Be quick.
Don't touch your bag, boy.
Get in line.
Where's the box?
There.
What's this? Who sits here?
- Me.
- Is this yours?
Yes. My sister must've put it in my bag.
I really don't understand.
Such things at your age.
Whose is this?
Whose is this?
Tell me boys, whose is this?
Yours?
You bring a penknife to school?
You've been told countless times.
It's forbidden.
You never listen.
Are you coming to school
or a fashion show?
Here's a laser.
What's this?
Whose is this?
Mine.
It's not a school notebook.
What is it, then?
Well, it's private.
Private?
You're at school. Private, how?
Stand up straight.
- Your nails...
- I cut them yesterday.
Yesterday?
They grow so fast?
I really did, sir.
Cut them again before tomorrow.
We've told you,
lighters are not allowed.
Are you coming
to school or to a tea house?
What's up? What are you gossiping about?
It's funny.
What's funny?
The letter we found on your Sevim!
My Sevim?
What about her?
Poor thing. She wrote a love letter,
at her age.
A love letter? Sevim? To whom?
I don't know. Who could it be to?
Who could it be to?
I don't know. What do you think?
Don't know. What do you think?
What's all this secrecy? I don't get it.
There's a letter, so what?
What do you mean "so what"?
There are rules.
Or why bother doing searches?
Let them smoke.
Come on! You understand what I mean.
- It's not the same.
- It is.
You never wrote
a love letter in your life?
What do you mean? Not at that age.
Good for you.
You've never had a life then.
What? You only have a life
if you write letters?
Yes. Got nothing better to do than
make fun of a child's letter?
You're obviously bored stiff.
What's up, Samet?
Why are you talking to us like that?
Give me the letter. I'll sort it out.
Take it, no problem.
What about the principal?
No, Samet's the class teacher.
Take these too.
Okay, fine.
No need to get upset, Samet.
No one's getting upset.
Go sit in the warm teachers' room.
Why do you keep hiding in this hole?
Screw that madhouse. At least I can
relax in here.
You're right about that.
Won't argue with that.
But you'll freeze in here.
Then make some tea to warm us.
I can make tea.
No problem.
The principal showed up late again.
- Really?
- Sure.
He's newly married.
His wife must be so hot.
If I were him, I'd be late too.
Ah, Sevim.
It's you.
Come in.
You've got my letter, sir.
Can I have it?
My letter. You've got it.
Can I have it?
Sir, give it back.
Sevim,
why are you crying?
I don't get it.
Who told you I had the letter?
Who? Mrs. Kevser?
Sevim.
What's wrong?
Sevim, look...
Okay, it's alright.
Yes, I had your letter.
But I didn't read it and I won't.
I tore it up and threw it away.
No need to worry.
Where, sir? What if someone finds it?
Even if they did, they couldn't read it.
It's in tiny pieces.
Don't worry.
There's nothing to worry about.
Did you think
I was like the other teachers?
These things are normal for me.
Being in love
is a wonderful thing.
Okay?
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
When I was your age,
I was in love
with my literature teacher.
I saw her face everywhere.
Time passed and lots changed, of course.
But one thing I'm sure of...
I never had
such strong feelings ever again.
Okay?
I never again had feelings
that were so pure,
innocent and powerful.
Really.
You should appreciate these years, okay?
These experiences are so valuable
and so hard to find...
Please, sir.
Give me the letter, I'm begging you.
For God's sake,
what did I tell you, Sevim?
Aren't you listening? I said
I tore it up and threw it away.
Don't you believe me?
The letter's gone.
It doesn't exist anymore.
Come on in.
Don't you see the door's open?
Here's your tea.
Alright, Sevim?
Okay? Here's your gift.
Put it back in your bag.
It's yours, you know.
But don't bring it to school anymore.
Those idiots
don't understand such things.
I was scared
you'd say it was my present.
Well done for not talking.
I didn't exactly get what was
happening in there.
If I had, I wouldn't have let them.
Anyway.
So?
Did you read any
of the books I gave you?
Won't you give me the letter?
Not taking your gift?
What's up with her?
Aren't you coming?
I'll get my coat.
We're going to Turnagöl next week.
- What for?
- Parent visit.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I'm sick of every new principal's
crappy projects.
We do everything, so he can suck up
to the Directorate.
It's a pain for the families too.
Some are worse off than others.
Kids can be
embarrassed by where they live.
Someone needs to tell that clown
to stop the bullshit.
Something happened
on the last parent visit.
It was awful.
I didn't see my zipper was down.
We went in and sat.
Everyone was staring at me.
Something was off
but I didn't know what.
I leaned back,
and the bottom of my shirt stuck
through my open zipper.
It was a disaster.
That was when the guy asked me
if I wanted sugar.
I got up,
took some sugar
and immediately bent over.
She's here.
- Hi.
- Hi. Welcome.
Sorry. Hope I'm not too late?
No, not at all.
This is my friend Kenan. My housemate.
Came to town together today.
Nice to meet you.
- Likewise. Welcome.
- Thanks.
- Have a seat.
- Sit by the window.
- No need.
- No, please.
Thanks.
- I'll take your coat.
- Thanks.
Want a drink? We already ordered.
No problem.
Tea again, weak.
Something sweet?
No, thanks. Tea's fine.
Weak.
What have you been up to? How's school?
Fine. The usual.
School, then home at night.
I pass the time by drawing and stuff.
You draw?
Yeah. I try.
That's a great thing to do.
I started while I was at the hospital
in Ankara.
I liked it so I carried on.
That's nice.
Have you ever exhibited?
Sort of.
We have an association in Ankara.
We held an exhibition to support
prisoners' families.
Nothing big.
You're an English teacher, right?
Yes, but I don't know if I'm teaching
them English
or they're teaching me Kurdish.
This is your first year here?
Yes.
So two years before you can transfer.
No. Because of my disability,
I can go whenever I want.
Really?
And wherever I want.
That's great.
Sometimes I think about asking
for Istanbul. My sister's there.
That's great.
Yeah, there's something like that
in the regulations.
So, will you go?
Maybe.
But my parents don't want me to.
And the incident isn't that old.
It's okay here,
but it can be tough.
I don't know.
I think you should go.
No, no.
I get it.
I had a wide circle
of friends in Ankara.
- I was very free.
- Definitely.
I thought I'd never come back here.
But here I am.
Don't be like that.
Not all dreams come true.
It wasn't a dream. It was an ideal.
Of course it was.
But things didn't work out.
If I stay here,
maybe I should get a car?
That's a good idea. Yes.
A car means freedom.
Definitely.
You can at least go out and explore
the countryside.
Exactly.
- I like traveling.
- Yeah? Me too.
I do it all the time.
Nice.
Traveling's fine,
but it's hard in the snow.
No, it's not. You can still travel.
Ignore him.
All the roads are open.
- Travel to where?
- Wherever you want.
- Lots of great places around here.
- Such as?
Such as Diyadin Canyon. Ever been?
- The one near Agri?
- Just after Agri.
- How'd we get there?
- By car.
Fine, but if there's a snowstorm
you can't get through.
If you always worry,
you never do anything.
You just have to do it.
Must be nice there, I guess.
It's a beautiful place.
I went there
a few years ago with friends.
An incredible view.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
There are great places to see nearby.
Definitely.
I can take you some day, if you like.
What?
We can go some day if you want.
You have a car?
An old wreck.
Yes. Until you get yours,
me and my wreck
are at your disposal.
Thanks a lot.
Kenan!
Corner kick.
Kenan!
Come here.
The Director of Education wants
to see you and Samet.
- What for?
- Where's Samet?
- At home.
- Call him right away, okay?
- Something wrong?
- I don't know. Hurry, okay?
There's Samet.
- Tell him.
- They didn't call us.
- I don't know.
- Hope it's not serious.
What's up?
The Director wants to see us.
- Who?
- The two of us.
Why?
I don't know.
The principal just told me.
- Bekir?
- Yeah.
Didn't you ask why?
Sure, but he didn't say.
What do you mean?
He mumbled something.
I didn't understand.
Couldn't you ask him
properly and find out?
We have to go, anyway.
What did he say, exactly?
Something about a project.
Said he didn't know.
Fuck him, he doesn't know.
- When?
- Right now.
- Right now?
- Yeah.
Damn.
I'll call Bekir.
If he doesn't know,
maybe they're making you principal
and me vice principal.
What?
Anything's possible.
Asshole isn't answering.
Who was with him?
I don't know.
So, think we got promoted?
Look at you. Are you getting excited?
Come in.
Come on in.
Take a seat.
You sit there.
What's-his-name
will be here in a minute.
Fatih!
Yes, sir.
Bring us tea.
Bring one extra.
How's it going?
- Good.
- Thank you, sir.
How are you yourself?
Is the school warm enough?
It's fine this year.
Good.
Stick it out. We want to install
central heating.
We've done it in six villages.
We'll do it everywhere
as the budget allows.
We already have central heating.
Right. I mixed you up
with Karasu.
We want to install it there too.
That's good.
Determined
to replace all the stoves in the area.
Right.
Mr. Bekir said you wanted to see us.
We came straight away.
He didn't say why...
Here's the tea.
Thanks.
Come in, Atakan.
Sorry, I'm late.
Take a seat.
Atakan is the counselor
at the boarding school.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Well, guys.
It was almost curtains for you.
You escaped by the skin of your teeth.
What do you mean, sir?
This isn't easy to talk about, but...
there are allegations of inappropriate
contact with students.
What?
How?
Your genius principal
sent us his report straight away,
so the district governor knows too.
About what?
I don't understand. There's a complaint
against us?
Yes.
About your closeness to the students.
What've we done?
Fortunately,
the governor is a sensible man.
He buried the report.
I wasn't here. Otherwise,
I'd have blocked it myself.
It must be a misunderstanding.
What's the problem exactly? Who...
There's no misunderstanding.
Unfortunately,
the complaint is about you two.
About us? What complaint?
Look.
Things like this happen every year.
We investigate
and mostly there's nothing.
Since your school has no counselor,
the complaint went to the principal.
And he sent it here
at the speed of light.
I called to warn him not to pour
gas on the fire.
These situations
are potentially explosive.
You never know what can happen.
- Right, Atakan?
- Yes, sir.
Things can get out of hand
and suddenly you've got a lynch mob.
You should always investigate first.
The governor got
angry about the principal.
I don't get it.
Who's accusing us
of inappropriate contact?
Besides, the principal sent us here.
He said nothing to us.
He thinks he's behaving professionally.
Look, you're fond of the kids
and pinch their cheeks or whatever,
but at that age,
their minds work different.
We never make shows of
affection like that. Never.
I don't even show any affection
to my niece in school to avoid
any misunderstanding.
What're you talking about?
What's that got to do with it?
I've worked
at that school for seven years
and look what happens.
I've been here thirty years
and they're still shitting on me.
It's that easy to defame someone?
Yes, it is. Sling mud
and see what sticks.
What about honor and dignity?
Is that so easy to destroy?
Excuse me, but this is very serious.
Who says it isn't?
Don't be childish, for God's sake.
Which students complained?
Look.
This is all you need to know. Okay?
There's a complaint
and the counselor talked to the students
to clear up the situation.
Yes.
What did they say?
I can't tell you that.
What do you mean?
We're accused,
but we don't know of what.
- How can that be?
- Yes, but...
Kenan, we just told you.
For God's sake!
It's about your contact with students.
What more can we say?
- But what's the exact allegation?
- If we knew, we could at least...
You want me to say "you did this,
you did that"?
Like a child?
You're adults. Forget about it.
I spoke to the students in person.
Luckily,
the complaint is
about your behavior in class.
What did we do?
- I can't tell you that.
- What did we do?
Kenan, calm down. Let Atakan finish.
If it had been about something
outside the classroom,
when no one else was present,
no one could help you.
Who made allegations? At least,
which class are they in?
Again, in such cases,
this information
is always kept confidential.
That's enough.
We can't give names.
You couldn't be objective then.
Listen here.
Don't ever try to find out who they were
or you'll be in big trouble.
Even I couldn't save you.
Knees bent.
You'll get power from your knees.
Come on.
Not like that.
How are you standing?
Wait. Look at me.
Shoulders out.
Serve now.
Not like that.
What's going on? What's this nonsense?
I don't know, Tolga.
- How did you hear?
- From Bekir.
He said he'd talk to you.
He talked alright.
He reported us to the district.
- Seriously?
- Now it's our turn to talk.
- Is he in his office?
- Hang on, wait.
Bekir? I want a quick word.
What's up?
You reported us
without even telling us, why?
We just followed the rules.
What rules?
Look.
The damage is already done.
There's nothing to say.
Both the director and the governor
were shocked by how you handled things.
I only applied the regulations.
It's not about regulations.
Forget about them.
Don't hide behind the rules.
You know better than the directors?
Forget about them.
They tell you one thing, and me another.
They even said I did the best thing.
- Don't lie to me.
- Why would I lie?
- We talked to them as well.
- So?
Don't talk about lying.
Calm down guys.
The door's open. Students will hear us.
Go outside.
Don't hang around here.
I understand you're mad at me.
You may be right, even.
But as soon as I heard it,
I called a counselor friend.
It's their specialty, isn't it?
Sure.
He said, "Don't cover it up."
"Otherwise, you'll be blamed."
That's right.
I'm trying to put myself in your place
and think about our teachers too.
I'm thinking out loud.
Maybe you could have...
No, no.
I'm trying to say...
Let's forget about who did this or that.
Everyone here should state their intent.
Intent? What intent could I have?
That's what I'm trying to get.
Come on now.
Put yourself in my shoes.
Well, I'm trying,
but I still don't think
I'd do what you did.
You'd do what?
Talk to the teachers first.
Alright, but suppose
the teachers were guilty?
Just supposing.
Would they say: "Yes we did it"?
That'd never happen.
What if the kids' imaginations were
manipulated to punish the teacher?
Who'd protect the teacher then?
Shouldn't the principal
listen to both sides
and be brave enough
to use his common sense?
If you were in charge,
you'd talk differently.
You were just trying to protect
your own position.
Don't try to squirm out of it.
I'm not squirming. Show some respect.
I just followed the rules.
Don't hide behind the rules.
How many years have we been
rotting together in this shithole?
Haven't we earned the right
to be told before a report is filed?
You're right, but these are not
everyday issues.
You're not sure what to do
when you hear things like this.
So you think you'd better ask an expert,
right?
We keep saying the same things.
Tell us what happened from the start,
for God's sake.
- We need to understand.
- That's right.
On Friday,
that Demir
brought a laser to school
and was pointing it at girls' skirts.
The girls complained to me.
So I gathered all the boys together.
- In the 8th grade classroom.
- Yes. Tolga was there too.
And Kevser gathered the girls.
Where?
Kevser and Saime were both there.
But Kevser spoke.
Where, I said?
- The 5th grade room.
- Yeah.
Hold on.
What did Kevser say to the girls?
General advice.
Advice? What exactly did she say?
Saime told me
it was on being careful
about their looks and behavior.
Don't get close to the male teachers.
You're grown ups now.
Be careful even when you walk past them.
Of course, that's sinful.
When walking past us, huh?
That shameless prude!
Bekir knows the rest. He was there.
Kevser told the girls to keep
things balanced and formal.
What's this about not getting too close?
Like, the teachers need
to respect distances too.
So she asked if anyone had a complaint.
What's she up to?
I don't get it.
It's outrageous. It's not possible!
She said be careful. What's the problem?
She's full of bile I think, but anyway.
Okay. And then?
Then two girls raised their hands.
Before they talked, I told them
to come outside.
We came here.
- Who were they?
- Never mind.
Come on, you can tell us.
At least tell us which class.
Seventh grade? Eighth?
I can't say that either.
There's a strict rule.
The director stressed that.
No names, to protect the students.
Who else was in the room then?
Me, Kevser,
Saime, and the kids.
We talked to them here, not in front of
the other kids.
Doesn't matter. Kevser will tell
everyone anyway.
What did the students say?
I feel bad even talking about it.
No, no. We have to know the allegations.
They said, you put your arm round
their waists and shoulders.
Me?
I've never done that.
I don't even do that
with my closest friend.
- What the hell?
- And me?
You keep pinching their cheeks.
That's what they said.
Pinching? What pinching?
They were ready to say more,
but I got worried and cut them short.
God!
- Now, did I believe them...
- That doesn't matter.
It's not about you.
We're trying to
understand what happened.
That's what I mean. Believing isn't
the issue here.
Don't get me started.
I've seen principals
here in seven years.
You pull strings to get the job,
then you mess it up and we suffer.
Nonsense.
Nonsense, how?
- Kenan, you're wrong.
- The wrong's been done.
Look, Kenan.
You know I'm not a union member.
I have no Directorate pals.
So what? Everybody knows everything.
Of course.
Everybody knows everything, don't worry.
A principal should know how to deal
with a crisis like this.
Maybe you're mad at me because you think
you should be the principal.
- Not at all.
- Maybe you're right.
You've been here longest.
But it's not my fault
you didn't get the offer.
I swear,
when they offered me the job,
first thing I said was
that whoever's been here longest
should be principal.
Go ask them yourself.
That's not the issue.
It is.
No, it's not.
You've all known each other for years.
I came to this school after you.
I hear an allegation.
I don't know you that well.
Naturally, I can't be sure.
So I have to do
what the regulations say.
What's done is done.
Tell us who they were.
Don't get me involved, please.
You're already up to your neck in it.
No way.
Don't get me in trouble.
You know there are strict rules.
Don't talk like the principal.
What'll we do?
Take up arms?
That's what I'm saying.
What does it matter if you know?
Let it stay an enigma. So what?
Everyone at school will know, except us.
That's absurd.
The paranoia will kill us.
Everyone'll hear soon, anyway.
Don't leave us hanging.
So you'll find out then.
Hang in there. Don't get me in trouble.
You're such a coward.
What's the point of friendship
without some risk or sacrifice?
Don't try to sway me by talking
about friendship.
It won't work.
Look how he talks.
You know they tried to fire you
because you dated Firdevs?
We went and sorted it out.
We lied and swore for you.
We took a risk.
Why hang on to a secret
that'll come out soon anyway?
Come on.
Who'd fire me because of Firdevs?
Nonsense.
The mayor had a thing for your girl.
I know,
but once rejected, he backed off.
So, isn't it natural he wanted
to get rid of you?
No way. Makes no sense.
Look...
Okay, have it your way.
I got no more to say.
Look.
We promise we won't say that we know.
Right, Kenan?
Sure. We know it's forbidden.
Neither the students,
nor anyone else will have a clue.
It's just not easy
to have this hanging over us.
The case is closed, okay?
No point in opening it again.
You're the one who understands
us best in this dump, right?
Fuck you, Tolga.
do do la la Three, four, do do la la...
It's how kids' minds work.
You took her letter.
She's getting revenge for that.
And she's got a stupid friend
who's pissed off at Kenan.
What?
Do you see how
their minds work at that age?
Hang on. Are you telling us...
Look.
You never heard
anything from me. Understand?
Of course, we'll act like we don't know.
That's the best thing to do.
Of course. We won't act like kids.
Hold on,
are you definitely telling us it's...
Exactly. Those idiots,
Sevim and Aylin.
Unfortunately. It surprised me too.
But maybe it shouldn't have.
They say,
"Nothing human is alien to me."
Okay, but it wasn't me
who found the letter.
I even took it to protect her.
How would she know that detail?
She thought you read it.
And how am I involved?
- I didn't even know about the letter.
- I have no idea, Kenan.
But don't even dream of talking
to them about this.
You'll get into big trouble.
Case's closed.
Don't stir things up.
We know, the director warned us.
But it's outrageous.
You keep saying "outrageous".
It's way beyond that now.
But I told you
to stop giving them gifts.
Look at that.
Am I the guilty one now?
I didn't mean it like that.
Well?
Around here,
it's not like where you come from.
Every region has its own
realities and traditions.
Right?
Things like that
might be misunderstood here.
Don't get me started
with your traditions, for God's sake.
When it's just talk, you talk so big.
But when it's time to act,
you're scared.
What's the relation?
I'm just telling you the situation.
Fuck the goddamn situation!
You bow to consensus.
Why are you bleating about
other injustices, then?
Calm down.
Was it wrong to try to stretch your
narrow-minded habits?
Take a risk to bring civilization here?
That'll bring civilization?
How else will it come?
Look around. If we teachers don't do it,
who will?
If we're also trapped in this oppressive
culture of yours,
who's gonna do it?
Look, this place has even twisted
your thinking.
Where you're from, maybe we'd already
be in court now.
What are you on about?
So you've always thought this way
about the gifts but were never upfront.
You waited until now. That's actually
what annoys me.
So what? Can't we give a gift
to a good student?
No one's saying that.
But if the schoolboard
hears about these gifts later,
it might cause serious problems.
That's why.
You made me eat everything.
I polished it off so it's not wasted.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.
Sit down.
Notebooks out.
Notebook.
- They're out.
- No talking.
Notebooks out.
Title.
Perspective.
What?
Perspective.
What's that?
Quiet.
- Do we write in our drawing pads?
- Wherever you like.
No talking, write. Quiet!
No talking.
I'm trying to force something into
your tiny brains.
Don't make it harder.
Alright?
None of you will become artists.
That's clear.
You'll plant potatoes and sugar beets,
so the rich can live comfortably.
Isn't that so? Unfortunately, it is.
That's reality. Nothing we can do.
But the show must go on.
So don't talk and write what I say.
Do we write the bottom part, sir?
What?
The part at the bottom.
Do we write that too?
Why are you asking?
There's space there.
Shall we write that?
I said, why are you asking?
- Should we write that...
- I'm asking why.
Don't you understand?
What language am I speaking?
You didn't explain
what we needed to write.
Write whatever you like.
What the hell am I doing here?
- You wanted to see me?
- Come in.
Some of the students came to me
and said that you insulted them.
- They got scared, I guess.
- Really?
They took it hard.
Who are they?
Doesn't matter who.
They said you told them
to plant potatoes and whatever.
Just telling you to be careful.
Right.
Because there'll be trouble
if they tell their parents.
You know they're dreamers.
I get it.
Let's take it easy. Okay?
Okay, I get it.
I really get it.
Sit down.
Come. Come here.
You. I'm telling you.
Come up here.
You're lucky you live far.
You have a long ride to get here.
Otherwise, I'd expel you
from my class. Got it?
Go outside now.
Go and stand by the door.
Go on, out.
Go out.
Get out.
Out.
Anybody else itching for trouble?
Don't be shy, we'll sort it out.
Sefa,
great tie!
Yes, sir.
You should lend it to me one day.
Alright, I will.
- Sir?
- Yes?
You're the first teacher
to get mad at Sevim.
I wasn't expecting it.
That's how it goes.
I'm really surprised.
"Call no man happy till he dies."
- Isn't that right?
- Yes, sir.
My advice is,
don't believe the gossipers
and schemers in class.
- Okay?
- Okay, sir.
If you see any of their nonsense,
come tell me.
- Alright?
- Alright, sir.
Okay.
Yes?
Sevim told my sister...
Alright boy, not now.
I mean from now on.
Don't bring up the past like that.
We all know
exactly who and what these people are.
It's just a few, isn't it?
Yes.
There are always people like that.
What's important is knowing
how to deal with them.
The best way is to keep your distance.
Stop being their friend.
Alright?
Alright, sir.
Don't lean on the wall.
I said, don't lean.
Stand away from the wall.
Yes, you. Away from the wall.
Away.
Look at us, Samet.
Our troubles are far from over.
I even keep away from my niece.
And yet, look what they say.
I've lost my appetite ever since.
Should've kept to
herding instead of teaching.
At least I'd have some peace.
That's for sure.
Better off herding sheep
in the mountains than at school.
Tolga pretends to empathize with us,
but he laughs at us behind our backs
with Firdevs.
I heard them today. I think they're
enjoying this.
Really? Where?
In the teachers' room.
They stopped talking when they saw me.
Let them fucking laugh.
If I could only leave this hole,
I'd never see any of them again.
Okay,
but it's still hard to digest.
We're colleagues, after all.
Fuck colleagues.
Everybody's out to screw each other.
They're all miserable, don't you see?
Yes, exactly.
But it really was a close shave.
We almost made headlines.
Don't exaggerate.
No need to be that scared.
Why should I be scared after all
I've been through?
You've been here seven years.
Boredom's all you've seen.
That's not true. Don't say that.
Even at the start,
it wasn't easy.
When I found out I'd been posted here
in August
seven years ago,
I was up in the mountains
near our village
herding my dad's flock.
I felt relieved now that I had a career.
I was so happy.
And the same day we heard that
my brother-in-law had died.
He'd just married my sister.
What happened?
He went to Diyarbakir, where my sister
was teaching.
Nobody knew him there, of course.
They thought he was a spy
and shot him right downtown.
No way.
Then the organization apologized.
They thought he was a military spy.
The guy's fucking dead.
What good's an apology?
That's bad.
Talking in blood has become
the fate of our East, unfortunately.
I couldn't even celebrate
becoming a teacher.
I found out what it's like to feel joy
and sorrow at the same time.
Hey, you're leaving this year.
We don't have one photo together.
Been housemates for two years.
Let's take a photo here.
Huh?
Yeah?
Okay. What, a selfie?
No. Something better.
With the view behind.
Okay.
How d'you want it?
Come here.
You're putting it there.
I'll set the timer.
The view's beautiful.
- Gonna stand like that?
- Yeah.
- Ready?
- Go ahead.
How are you? Any better?
I'm good. Thanks.
After being on the drip, huh?
Yeah, right.
I'll take this.
Go ahead.
Want me to get someone?
No need. I'll manage.
The list's inside. Even the boot sizes.
- Hand them out.
- Okay.
Come in.
We asked for a coat for you.
Take any coat you like from the box.
Okay, sir.
I got one.
Good. There are bags there.
Put it in one.
Alright.
Look in the box, Delila.
You can take any coat
and sweater you like, alright?
Can I take these, sir?
Okay. There's a bag behind you.
Put them in that.
Enjoy 'em. Don't show anyone.
Tell the next person to come in.
Thanks, sir. Goodbye.
Come in.
Are you in my class?
Yes.
- What was your name?
- Halime.
Right.
Get what you want from the box.
It says boots here.
Okay.
What does your father do?
He's not here.
Is he in town?
Your parents are alive though, right?
Yes.
Okay.
- Have you chosen?
- Yes.
Good. Nice choice.
Not too small for you?
No, they'll fit.
There's a bag behind you.
Put them in it.
You okay?
We were thrown into the air.
I remember being on the ground.
Everyone was shouting and moaning.
I was still in one piece there.
A steel ball had severed a vein
and gangrene set in.
Unbelievable.
And then? Ambulances and police?
God, no. A police officer even said
sweep them up to his squad.
It's in the report.
The ambulances were so late
and taxis refused to take the wounded.
Didn't want their seats dirtied.
Yeah.
That and much worse.
I only made it to the hospital
because a guy convinced a taxi driver.
Otherwise... I lost many friends there.
Did you see that guy later?
Yes.
He reached out five or six months later.
He's from the Eastern branch.
The time in hospital sucked.
Spent eight months there.
Most doctors were from our union.
They really tried to save the leg,
but failed.
After they cut it off,
I thought I'd die.
I never thought such pain was possible.
If they'd said, "We kill your parents
and it stops",
I'd have gladly said yes.
Just to stop the pain.
Sorry for telling you
all this while eating.
It's fine.
It's really unbelievable.
I'm lost for words.
You can't grasp certain things
without experience.
This is definitely one.
Do the other teachers at school
know about the explosion?
No, they think it was an accident.
Some might know.
Don't they ask?
Not really. My school is big.
Everyone minds their own business.
And I'm not that close to anyone.
It's better they don't know.
They'd only judge you.
Funny thing is, until this happened,
even my family
didn't know about anything.
They follow politics,
but they're not radical.
Mine are the same.
How's your family gonna be radical?
They've spent their lives
in a tiny village.
Their only cares are their cattle
and marrying you off.
Don't say that.
I've seen such radicals and fanatics
in that tiny village.
Kenan's from an Alawi village.
Same culture as you.
I don't care about that sectarian stuff.
- They're all primitive.
- Definitely.
Sure.
But they must've been devastated.
- Who?
- Your family.
Of course.
That's a whole different drama
I won't go into.
You can't tell from your walk.
Honestly! You walk better than me.
Thanks.
It's a quality prosthesis.
The government provides some,
but none as good as this.
Theirs make you limp.
If you get your own, they only pay
a small amount.
- Well, that's something.
- Yeah.
What about the car, by the way?
Waiting for the dealer to bring it.
Oh, so you got one?
For sure.
Fantastic!
It takes a while, switching the gas
and brake pedals.
That's great. Wonderful.
Congratulations.
It'll change your life, you'll see.
So, when's it coming from the dealer?
Can I take a photo of you?
Why?
I mean, sure you can.
You have quit
 an interesting face, actually.
A face that somehow embodies
the story of this land.
- You think so?
- Yeah. Definitely.
I'll use it for my portrait drawings.
Okay, sure.
Move the plate a bit.
You, move your arm.
Out of the frame.
I'll do it like this.
What should I do? Look at you?
Nothing. Just look at the camera.
At first,
it looks like an ordinary face.
But then
there seems to be a strange sorrow
somewhere deep inside.
I'm not exactly sure, though.
Sorry if I got a bit weird.
No, it's okay. Thanks.
Don't move.
Don't smile.
By the way, my parents
will visit my sister in Istanbul soon.
You two can come, and I'll cook for you.
Alright, but we wouldn't want
to make work for you.
It's no trouble.
Don't expect a feast,
but you won't starve.
Spaghetti and wine are guaranteed.
That's great.
- My favorites.
- Yeah?
I love spaghetti and wine.
Okay.
I love them.
The weather's terrible.
Really?
Ice all over.
They let the tap at the mosque freeze.
I told them a hundred times.
Leave the water running.
Even a dribble would be enough.
Some idiot always turns it off.
It's so cold.
I couldn't see where I was going.
It's dark as a dungeon out there.
I better go after I finish this, then.
What?
I said, I better go.
Why? It's early.
No, I better go.
The electricity's cut off.
Exactly, why sit in the dark at home?
- His mother's waiting.
- What?
His mother's waiting.
Go to their street
at any time of the night
and you'll see
a tiny silhouette in the window.
That silhouette is his mother.
She waits there
all night until he returns.
I've told her a million times,
I don't know when I'll be back.
But she doesn't listen.
Soon as I get near,
she turns off the light and goes to bed.
Like I won't see. At least wait with
the lights off.
I don't blame her.
She doesn't trust you.
It's better now.
When he was younger, she'd go out
and look around for him at dusk.
She can't do it as much now.
Poor woman just waits at the window.
So she realized it back then.
What?
- "What" what?
- What did she realize?
That you're a restless,
good-for-nothing vagabond.
That's how it is here.
It's not just mine.
Mothers here are on pins and needles.
When I was just seven,
on a dark night like this,
the gendarmes came and took my dad,
right out of his bed.
As they were taking him away,
he said "wait".
Stopped everyone.
Searched his pockets.
Found a lottery ticket, gave it
to my mom and that was it.
Never saw him again.
That's why my mom has worried
about me for years.
Not because I'm restless.
Anyway,
what's interesting is that
the only thing
I remember from that night,
isn't my father.
It's the flicker on the ceiling
from the stove.
I wondered for years
why I remembered that.
Then I realized it's not about what
has happened,
it's about what's beyond the visible.
What goes on inside.
- Win anything?
- What?
The lottery ticket, did you win?
Nothing.
Not even your money back?
No.
Fuck that. You won nothing from
a ticket like that?
Forget that stuff.
Always the same story.
Same old words. Every year,
he pretends to go.
Then I see him
kicking back in the tea house.
You need to sort yourself out.
Don't talk the talk,
if you can't walk the walk.
Want to go, do you? Then go.
You think guerilla life's a picnic?
Find a decent job,
so your mother can sleep at night.
Save your mother first,
then you can save the world.
Fine, Vahit. If that's what you think,
I'll shut up.
Look.
Times have changed.
It's not the same. It's a vendetta now.
Everyone's out for revenge.
Nothing's clear anymore.
No one knows who wants what,
or who won't give what, and why not?
It's obscure on all sides.
Look here.
Enter the swamp, you'll sink.
That's for sure.
But if you want to drain the swamp,
you gotta be smart and not enter it.
And you gotta give it time.
If you want to sink, that's up to you.
Right, teacher?
Know what I think?
If you put up shelves and put that mess
lying around on them,
the shop'd look fresher.
Your heart's drying up, Vahit.
You seem gripped by fear.
Must be your age. But that's okay.
Who's talking about fear?
There's more to life than a full belly.
- Like what?
- Lots of things!
I'll sink if I fucking must. What have
I got to lose?
What have you got?
What about your life, idiot?
And your youth.
You think that's nothing?
You're just blowing hot air.
Talking nonsense.
A life is valuable even if it's aimless,
faithless and dishonorable?
Give me a little whisky.
Of course it is.
It definitely is.
For sure it is.
You think anyone
without a Mauser is a lowlife.
Don't you?
Who was it that said:
"Youth is such a wonderful thing.
What a pity it's wasted on the young"?
So, we're aimless,
faithless and dishonorable?
No one said that.
But if you carry on, someone will.
So what if they do?
It's your problem.
Why you fucking asking me?
But one day they will.
They'll need to have
some guts to say that.
They'll need balls of steel to say that.
Whoever fucking says that,
I'll make 'em piss from their belly.
Don't be childish. What's the gun for?
I'm surprised that
you didn't give that asshole
what he deserved.
Always talking about honor.
What was I supposed to say to the guy?
You know what I mean.
Don't talk in riddles.
I said it, so you know your enemies
from your friends.
If someone stands
in the middle of the fucking village
bad mouthing you,
I wouldn't stand for it.
That's how I am.
I wouldn't allow it.
Am I the guilty one now?
I wish I hadn't opened my mouth.
No one's guilty.
If you don't shut the guy up,
if you let him talk,
he'll continue talking.
You always talk big,
but you won't even stop
some guy mouthing off.
It's not right.
Sorry.
Anyway, I'm going.
Stay put. We'll go together.
- No.
- We'll leave together.
I won't be able
to get up in the morning.
So don't get up, then. Sit down.
No, no.
You two have fun.
Come on, sit down.
Hey.
What's your problem, for God's sake?
Aren't you being too hard on him?
What were you on about?
I didn't even get it.
He comes here and keeps telling me
"so and so said this and that about you".
All kinds of crap.
The hell you doing about it, then?
Are you a statue or what?
Can't you speak up?
It's not the first time.
Yeah, okay.
I couldn't take it anymore.
I still think you're too hard on him.
It's not always easy to step in.
People talk. Forget about it.
Look, you've upset the kid for nothing.
You should just make up with him.
You see, it's not easy to stand
alone around here.
Everyone wants you to pick sides.
Some call you a coward,
others a traitor.
Someone else comes
and says you're a turncoat.
That's how lives are lived out here.
I cured two cows for this one guy.
Then he came and shot my dog.
Why?
Because he's human.
Yeah, he's human.
What's up? Still awake?
Yeah.
I gotta turn the school lights off.
I was on duty and forgot.
You have tea?
No, but I can make some.
Okay, you make tea.
I'll turn off the lights.
Okay.
The keys?
Right.
What's that?
Did you draw all that stuff?
- What?
- On the walls.
No.
There was
a history teacher here before me.
When he left,
he even asked me to pay
for the kitchen counter.
- You shouldn't have.
- Sure I didn't.
When I didn't pay up, he tried to take
the counter with him.
Asshole.
I'd never met such a creep before.
He kept burning his coal even in May
so no one else could use it.
So, yeah.
He was a real asshole.
His kid must've drawn them.
Why haven't you painted the place since?
Why the hell should I?
Anyway.
By the way,
what happened is probably
all over the village.
What?
- You mean, that...
- Yeah.
They make insinuations.
Like what?
Nothing really.
Just insinuations.
Fuck that. So what if it gets around?
"So what"?
They'll tear us to pieces.
Nothing'll happen.
Don't be paranoid.
It's not paranoia.
It's just that I can't get over it.
Over what?
I can't get my head round it.
Or rather, can't make sense of it.
How could these girls,
who I think so highly of and
who seem to adore me,
say such things about me?
That's children's psychology.
Who knows what they thought up?
Yeah, but it doesn't make sense.
That's what bothers me.
Fuck it. Don't let it bother you.
Fuck you, Tolga, always so relaxed.
You're wrong. I'm in shock too.
I even said: "Look, girls.
These are very serious accusations."
They said, "Yes, but it upsets us, etc."
I asked, "Why did you hang around
your teacher then?"
What did they say?
Nothing clear, of course.
"But sir, blah blah blah."
"Look", I said...
Alright, but what did they say?
What did Sevim say, for instance?
I don't remember exactly.
Just stuff like, she's upset.
Also said she's scared.
Scared?
- Something like that.
- Scared of what?
I don't know.
But it seems they went after Kenan more.
How's that?
As if they were mad at Kenan,
and you got caught up in it.
What do you mean?
I'm saying, maybe Kenan was their mark.
Why?
Maybe Kenan's jealous that
the girls like you and not him,
so he's acting
overly friendly with them.
Is that possible?
I don't know.
Might be something like that.
You mean Kenan was their real target
and I just got caught in the middle?
Yes.
Aylin actually
complained more about Kenan.
But Sevim said some stuff too.
Like he pinches girls' cheeks.
You serious?
Stares at them during lessons.
How about that?
He doesn't look brave enough
for stuff like that.
Though he might be.
I don't know.
Sevim might've encouraged Aylin
to avoid being alone.
You know Sevim.
Not that well.
That's what I think.
What am I doing here?
What kind of people
are we involved with?
Why did we
get into this fucking profession?
All those years spent studying.
Don't mention this to anyone.
Sure. Who would I tell?
It's just what I think.
It might not be true.
No, it's probably true.
Look at him.
Talk about a dark horse!
Lecturing me about ethics.
Saying I shouldn't give gifts
and to respect sensibilities.
Well, well, well.
He thinks he can dump it in my lap.
What a rat.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Did you eat?
Yeah, I got
some pastries in town. Have some.
Wonderful.
I couldn't eat all day.
This is great.
Heat them up.
No need. Fine like this.
Tea?
No, thanks.
Enjoy.
What's up?
What do you mean?
Why didn't you eat?
My parents' medication ran out.
They needed a new prescription.
The druggist refused. Said they had
to come in person.
How can old people come all that way?
You were in town too?
Well, mostly at the hospital.
Really? If I'd known, we could've come
back together.
We could've,
but my timing was kinda mixed up.
Mixed up?
Went to a mechanic, too.
Couldn't eat with all that hassle.
What did you do?
Remember,
they messed up my teacher score?
- I went to get it fixed.
- They do it?
They whined, but it got done.
Nowhere else has such an awful
education office.
How can they forget the service score?
Yeah, well.
Civil servants are people, after all.
True,
but this has a huge effect
on a teacher's fate.
A few points can change where you spend
your whole youth.
If you hadn't noticed, lots of people
would be ahead of you unfairly.
Exactly.
It's good you sorted it out.
I thought I saw your car there.
I almost ran after you,
but I wasn't sure.
Why didn't you call?
I didn't want to disturb you.
Why would you have disturbed me?
Don't know. Would I have?
Would you what?
Have disturbed you.
No, why?
I see you take bread home,
Comrade Nuray.
Yet you leave poor dogs
to die of hunger.
They have their fates too.
Wow.
I didn't think you believed in fate.
I'm full of surprises.
What're you doing here?
I left school early to go to
the education office.
I needed some cash too.
You just get out?
Yes. We had
a charity sale at school today.
Waste of time as usual.
Expected a festival? Just be grateful
for the charity.
What're you up to?
You have time for coffee?
I can't now.
Okay.
Actually, I don't have much time either.
I need to get back.
Okay. Some other time, then.
Sorry.
No, it's alright.
- Some other time.
- Okay.
What's Kenan up to? He's at home?
Kenan? No idea.
He said his father was sick.
I didn't talk to him again.
Like I said, I left early.
Haven't you seen him?
No, how would I have?
Don't know, just asked.
Anyway. Talk to you later.
Okay. What are
you two doing this weekend?
You could come over.
What?
I told you, my family's going away.
Come for dinner.
Oh, yeah.
- Maybe Saturday?
- Okay.
Fine for us. Have they left?
No, tomorrow.
Alright. Tell Kenan, then.
Seven okay?
Yeah, seven is great.
Okay. Send you my address later.
Alright.
Won't be any problem with the neighbors?
- Neighbors?
- Yeah.
We fought and won some rights, you know.
- Don't be silly.
- Just asking.
- We fought for decades.
- For sure.
Better believe it.
Just as I'd expect from you,
Comrade Nuray.
See you later.
- Bye.
- Take care.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Come on in.
- You okay?
- Damn it, I tripped.
Where's Kenan?
If I say it's just me?
Why?
Kenan's got a lot on his plate.
His father's sick and old, you know.
You should've told me.
We could have postponed or something.
You think so?
I did think about it, but...
Have I been an asshole?
No.
- I'll go if you like.
- No.
- Really.
- It's not that big a deal.
It's just too bad that he's missing
out on the feast.
- Come in.
- It's his loss, anyhow.
No, no need.
Did anyone see you come in?
- Did anybody see you?
- No.
I snuck in like a thief.
But what about those rights you won?
Okay, but there's no need to push it.
By the way...
Thanks, there was no need.
It's nothing.
Nice.
No one's home, right?
Locked the folks in the closet.
They won't cause trouble.
You look very nice, by the way.
The skirt suits you.
Thanks.
You get these at the grocer's?
They're wrapped like parsley.
Just in case.
You know how things are here.
- I'll put them in water.
- Okay.
Have a seat. Are you hungry?
We can eat straight away.
Yeah, maybe.
I'll sit down then.
Fine. Be back in a minute.
If you say you painted these,
I won't believe you.
I did. Why?
They're really good.
You call that
"community education level"?
Oh, come on.
No, I'm serious.
You're much better than me.
I just don't get
how you could find meaning
in Kenan's face.
You never know
where you'll find meaning.
The time for transfers is coming.
What will you do?
I'll try every trick to get out of here.
We'll see if there's an opportunity.
And you, still not considering it?
You can go anywhere. If I were you...
- It's hard for me to go.
- Why?
First, the family
isn't ready for that idea.
I know people in Istanbul.
Friends from the organization.
If I go there, I won't have any
problems socializing.
Sure. Impossible not to socialize there.
If you can't there, you can't anywhere.
Someone needs to stay here.
What'll happen if we all leave?
Yeah, there's that too.
But you have to think
about your own life.
Life will take care of itself.
I've done my share.
Others can do theirs.
Four years! Isn't that enough?
If you say so.
But I think you're exaggerating a bit.
Exaggerating what?
You blame this place for
all your problems. It's false.
What do you expect in Istanbul?
No idea.
Wherever you go,
your problems go with you.
I can't think about that right now.
All I know is that this place
is dragging me down.
All I see is emptiness.
Things shriveled and bent by the cold.
Hungry, sick, helpless dogs.
You'd manage to see the same things,
even in Switzerland.
Don't worry.
Doesn't matter.
I'll face my destiny. Good or bad.
I say go big or go home!
Right.
I was like you before the explosion.
Rushing around like I was missing out
with no foresight.
So I should be sensible,
satisfied and grateful?
- Not at all.
- What, then?
If you're complaining, it means
something could or should be done.
You realize, get annoyed and complain.
You should react, but you don't.
- You run.
- What else should I do?
Devote my life to this place?
No.
I've done my duty and now I'm off.
I've given four years to this hellhole.
Isn't that enough?
It is,
but someone needs to do something.
I'm always for action. People need
to get involved.
That's what the world needs.
Some more?
Sure.
For example, you follow politics
and get mad at everything.
Do I?
You do.
I read the news but I don't follow
anything closely.
You think that,
because I complain a lot?
You complain, but what changes?
My father's like you, as well.
He's retired and has nothing to do.
He just gets mad.
Should he set himself on fire
outside Parliament?
No, but complaining changes nothing.
- So?
- Got to focus on action.
How do you view the world?
How do you place yourself?
Place myself?
I mean, what "ism" are you?
"Ism"? What the hell is that?
You must belong to some faction.
I don't feel a need to define myself
as anything.
Maybe I used to,
but that phase is in the past.
It's not about phases.
How do you contribute to the world?
What do you do?
- Is it his a goodness contest?
- No.
I'm asking where you stand,
where you feel you belong.
If you want to answer.
A sheltered life within a group
with the same ideologies
isn't really for me.
Why not?
- Don't believe in solidarity?
- It's not that.
Maybe I find it
incompatible with freedom.
- Why?
- I don't know.
All I know is,
something in me firmly rejects
that kind of existence.
It's not just about you, though.
What are you doing
for the world, I'm asking?
Everyone contributes somehow.
It's no big deal.
Those who're able, do things.
And others don't.
- In society, everyone can do something.
- Yes.
How do you feel when you see
rapes, corruption
and refugees in the news?
Upset, but
the world's troubles are endless.
- You shut your eyes.
- No.
You keep problems at a distance.
What if I do?
Does everyone have to be a hero?
No, but you seem to embrace selfishness.
Isn't that why the world lacks reason,
equality and conscience?
You think the same rules
can be applied everywhere?
Is an idea that's logical to us
also logical in Mongolia?
Cultures differ,
but aren't people's basic needs
the same everywhere?
Don't ask me. I can't even get my own
thoughts together.
Like what?
I don't know.
I think justice is a utopian idea.
Equality too.
For that, everyone has to be the same,
which is nonsense.
Everything's different.
The world is a struggle
between different, ever-moving forces.
History is the sum of that,
but we don't accept it.
I don't even like thinking about it,
because it leads to chaos.
Whereas order is needed
for life to continue.
So we prefer
to believe your charming tales.
They're facts, not tales.
That's what the structure of history is.
You see chaos as a negative
and destructive force.
"If only humanity had a nicer history!"
Unfortunately, it doesn't.
You keep proposing bowing down.
Isn't that contrary to your principles?
Not at all.
Fancy words will never replace bringing
a bucket of water
to a place suffering from drought.
Can this wretched world be helped?
That's the only question.
I'm not opposing that.
- But why are you attacking me?
- Cause you're here.
I'm tired of
asking myself those questions.
Don't you think change is needed?
There're things that need to change
and things that don't.
Am I happy with
the state of the world? No.
But that doesn't mean I gotta belong
to a clique.
- That's the real problem.
- What?
Educated people like you getting
lost in uncertainties.
They leave
the public arena to the ignorant.
Maybe the public arena
was designed for them.
Isn't it obvious that division is human?
Ideologies and even goals
can easily be misused
to satisfy objectives.
I don't think much about these things.
Man dreams, tries,
builds and then destroys.
That's how history unfolds.
For me, history recalls
the weariness of hope.
Aren't you
a product of this history too?
If we viewed history as a system,
wouldn't that save us from confusion?
You believe people would really be happy
if their needs were met?
Why not? That hope is all we've got.
Hasn't hope always been the key
driving force for humanity?
- Like waiting for a messiah?
- That's nonsense.
Doing something can never be equated
with weakness.
Free society, but not individuals?
Social struggle involves
social responsibility.
Where do you see yourself in this?
I'm in favor of freedom.
What freedom?
What do you mean by freedom?
Human freedom.
History has a course, the planet too,
and the course of humanity is freedom.
You think socialists live in a cage
with limited freedom?
It's freedom
for people we're fighting for.
Well, I happen to be a member
of some charitable foundations.
I'm not the one you should be grilling.
Your approach is weird though.
You act a bit lumpen. You don't want
to get involved,
but if the work's done,
you'll support it.
Should I get beaten by the cops?
You talk like a liberal.
Isn't that kind of support the same
as siding with the strong?
So why not do it now? Go side with
the government.
Bravo for making me pro-government.
You measure sensitivity.
That's as futile as judging a suicide.
I'm not measuring anything.
I'm annoyed that you stigmatize those
who do something when you don't.
Isn't that the topic?
Would you be happier
if I said I trusted people?
Say what you think. You do anyway.
But you generalize.
There are exceptions,
and reasons for them.
I think, even self-sacrifice
often means indebting the other.
Even the suicide bomber
does it to exist,
not to cease to exist.
I can't help but get mad
at the undeserved trust
of ideologically motivated crowds.
Their sticky blind morality
and their happiness because they're
like-minded.
Sorry.
Why is it so important for everyone
to think the same?
And I'm all alone in the middle
of all this noise.
But despite all,
the whisper of
that unique source inside me
reminds me how human it is to oppose
and to feel bored.
Seeing the connection between obsessions
and ideas
doesn't make me a degenerate.
Doesn't it matter that a person has
the courage to sacrifice himself,
whether for an ideal, or a lofty cause,
even if brainwashed?
Especially today.
Of course it does.
Then that means
you should somehow understand
and forgive the suicide bomber
that cost you your leg.
Can you do that? Whatever his thoughts
or beliefs.
I can, if needed. That's not the issue.
And I didn't imply
you were a degenerate.
What if those people you scorn
came together over shared ideals?
Aren't there evils that are only
overcome with the solidarity you hate?
- Of course.
- "Of course".
Of course there are. I'm not saying
the contrary.
What I'm saying is this.
You know very well,
the actions of a society
are not equal to the sum of
its individual parts.
Isn't that reason enough to stay away
from the herd?
Whatever their reasons or motivations?
The well-off may have that luxury.
A proverb says,
"If you travel in a herd,
all you'll see are asses."
Well for some, those asses might
mean a blessing,
security and warmth.
- Right?
- I guess.
What about you?
How do you contribute?
- Me?
- Yeah.
- Me?
- Yeah.
I can't, anymore.
As you see,
I'm retired due to disability.
Don't say that.
I mean, that's not what I see.
That's not where I'm looking.
I'm looking somewhere else.
- A fill up?
- Alright.
You need time
to get to know someone.
On the other hand, certain things,
if left to time,
would just be a waste of time.
Right?
Yes.
This process can be quickly handled
with a few questions.
I'm sure it can.
No need to waste time.
It's not necessary.
Okay?
Now, for instance.
What are you like?
How do you mean?
What kind of person are you?
In what sense?
Answer the question however
you understand it.
How you understand it
is an answer in itself.
Shall I tell the truth or try to make
you happy?
The truth, of course.
Alright.
Very romantic, fond of his family,
charitable...
What? Can't that be true?
What do you think I am?
And your worst trait is
excessive compassion, right?
How did you guess?
I'm serious.
Are you religious, for example?
Sometimes.
Do you think there's a God?
For those who believe, he exists.
You're avoiding the question.
Let's move on.
Are you fond of your family?
I'm not overly fond of anything.
Good, now we're getting somewhere.
What else?
Are you selfish?
Very.
Wow, you're brave.
When I'm not scared, yes.
Do you like children?
Depends on the child, I guess.
Are you a faithful lover?
Except in special circumstances, yes.
What do you mean?
I think you got it.
Moving on.
Do you have a girlfriend?
- Not for a long time.
- Why not?
Let's say I'm picky.
You're modest too.
Let's drink to that.
Okay, last question.
Why didn't you tell Kenan
about my invitation?
Take a guess.
You mentioned something
about history earlier.
Hope.
Hope and what?
The weariness of hope?
Yes, that's it.
The weariness of hope.
Nice phrase.
I'm weary too.
Like I've lived a really long time.
Everything seems to take so long here.
Lessons,
breaks,
waiting for weekends,
nights,
everything.
Could you turn off
the living room lights.
It's too bright.
- The lights.
- Alright.
Honestly, at first it felt a bit weird
when my leg touched yours,
but I got used to it.
Interestingly,
I even started to like it.
You're not mad I said that?
No, quite the opposite.
Besides, if we
don't normalize it right away,
it'll hang over us like
the sword of Damocles.
That's true.
In fact, for a moment it felt like
what you experienced was destined.
Like it happened
to give you a second life.
As if this incomplete state had made
you complete.
You always exaggerate.
But I like the idea.
Is that you?
Yes.
Early twenties were nice.
You lived as you pleased,
without schedules.
Everything is so planned now.
This adjusts the suction.
Turning it up pushes the air out
and helps you walk smoother.
That's good.
But it runs down the battery.
Wow, it's
an advanced piece of equipment.
Expensive though.
About the price of a new mid-range car.
No way.
Maybe more, since the dollar's up now.
Listen.
Yes?
You won't tell Kenan, will you?
Tell him what?
What just happened.
I won't.
But why not?
No reason.
Just don't.
Alright, I won't.
I won't, but what's the big deal?
Do you ever see him?
Sure. He's teaching me to drive.
Really? That's great.
Wow, Kenan.
You never mention this stuff.
Opening the shop on a Sunday?
My wife's yakking at home
was driving me crazy.
I escaped to the shop.
I made breakfast for myself.
Come have some.
No, thanks. I've eaten.
What happened to the kid?
He's not around.
Who knows where he's hiding out.
He mentioned a nightclub job.
Same old stories, never mind.
Why?
Just asking.
Couldn't get the money?
What money?
Doesn't he owe you?
That doesn't matter.
Haven't seen him
for a while. I was worried.
What about you? Did you clear the air?
Haven't seen him since.
Really?
- Has he called you?
- No.
Um... How are you?
Good, sir.
- Your sister?
- Yes.
- Hi.
- Hi there.
Where were you?
All night?
Here now.
And you? Didn't you go to your village?
No, it wasn't planned.
I had extra lessons.
I got warm pastries.
Hope you're not full.
- With cheese?
- Yeah.
I'll have some then.
- Weak?
- Okay.
- Looks good.
- Yeah.
Where were you?
Where were you?
You know,
life's so strange.
Sometime things happen that
you'd never expect.
What happened?
I went to
the education office yesterday.
My head was full of this transfer stuff.
I was walking around in a daze.
I got money from the ATM
and who did I see?
Who?
Nuray.
So?
We stood and chatted a while.
So she invited me to her place
for something to eat.
I said okay.
Her family had gone someplace.
We went there and talked.
It was such a nice talk. Really.
I wasn't expecting that.
She's really smart.
We had something to eat and drink.
Then wine, alcohol and so on...
And?
And,
I don't know.
Am I doing something I'll regret later?
I don't know.
Meaning?
You never know what life will bring.
I don't believe in fate or stuff,
but it kinda felt like that.
I think these things
are outside our control.
They take place in those hazy areas
beyond our will.
And so they're the kind of acts
we don't need to feel responsible for.
Eat up. I'm not having much.
I will.
I'm so tired.
Luckily it's Sunday today.
I'm gonna rest.
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.
- Nuray.
- Hi.
Sorry, I came uninvited.
No problem. Welcome, come in.
What brought you here?
Come in.
- With my shoes?
- Sure, it's already a mess.
I surprised you, huh?
I bet you weren't expecting me.
That's true. But what a nice surprise.
I called Kenan, but he didn't answer
so I thought I'd try my luck.
I didn't hear. I was working,
my phone was on silent.
Take a seat, please.
I'll take your coat.
No need, thanks. I won't stay long.
So how did you
get here at this time of day?
By car.
What car?
My own car.
It came then.
Yes.
That's great. When?
A few days ago.
Called Kenan to ask him to come,
but he didn't answer.
- So I got it alone.
- Congrats.
Thanks.
Congrats, but how did you dare come here
in this weather on your own?
We could've picked you up.
Thanks, there was no need.
I've got to get used to it.
Kenan was busy I guess,
so I had to do it myself.
Actually, it was good. You learn better
on your own.
I'd have come, but I thought you didn't
need me anymore.
Thanks.
We made tea. Want some?
Or something cold? A beer?
Tea's fine.
Right away. Kenan?
No, I'm fine.
- Thanks.
- Enjoy.
How did you find this place in the dark?
GPS!
Ah, right. Well done.
I didn't only come here.
You know that village called Kirgindere?
Down that way.
I have a sick student there.
He hardly came this year.
Now that I drive, I can tutor him
so he doesn't fall behind.
Since you're nearby,
I decided to drop by.
That was good.
What was?
Your student. It was a good idea.
So, Kenan.
Why don't you answer your phone?
No particular reason.
No particular reason?
- No.
- What's it then?
Nothing.
What does all this mean?
I really don't get it.
What happened between us
to justify this attitude?
What's wrong?
Yeah, that's what I'm asking.
How do friendships that started
with such timidity
suddenly turn into arrogance?
Are you serious?
What happened?
Let me ask it this way, then.
Did I do something wrong?
No.
Does what happened with Samet
make me guilty for you?
Did I betray your friendship?
Or do I fall short of the moral standard
you imagine in a girl?
Please don't think
I expect anything from you.
I don't.
I'm just curious.
It's the first time in my current state
that I'm testing how others perceive
me as a woman.
I'm questioning
what I have the right
or the strength to do in this new state.
Trying to see what place I occupy
in this world now.
I need to know
what I lost along with this leg,
and what I still have.
I'm not expecting pity,
compassion or understanding.
I mean, nothing is expected here.
We don't have to see each other again.
That's fine too.
You might be right in your own way.
I don't know. It's possible.
But
it seems to me that
everything beautiful in this world
gets stuck in the webs we weave
before it ever reaches us.
Anyway.
Sorry, I came unannounced.
It's best if I go.
- Wait.
- Thanks for the tea.
Sit down, please. Don't go like this.
Let go, I'm fine.
I'll go just as I came.
The weather's worse.
Nuray.
Come back. Look, let's talk some more.
Wait.
Nuray!
Nuray!
What's going on?
Nothing.
What d'you mean nothing?
Can you take me back to town?
The snow's much heavier.
When I first came here,
they told me
there were only two seasons,
winter and summer.
They were right.
Straight into summer, no spring.
Grasses covered by snow for long months
grew yellow without becoming green.
Even the birds
that sang happily a few weeks ago
were chirping wearily.
I was like an abandoned mill,
a useless, rundown mill
that even birds ignored,
waiting for demolition.
In this forgotten,
remote corner of the earth,
like many other things,
the line between good and evil,
and pain and happiness was blurred.
Everything seemed to happen
only to forget time.
As if this incessant snow was striving
to bury everything
and make oblivion possible.
Seasons come and go,
hopes are born and die,
but still, life goes on
with a patient belief based on
something unknown.
My time to get out of here
was approaching.
This morning,
for the first time since the trouble
with Sevim,
I carefully combed my hair
and even whistled.
It was
the last days of school, after all.
There was the charity sale
and the graduation ceremony later.
Well done, Tolga, you get a free dinner.
Where've you been?
Why? I was packing.
You haven't stamped your report cards.
Careful, boy.
Calm down. Don't panic, I'll do it now.
Do what you like.
But they say the director is coming.
Really?
Yeah.
Great.
What's up? Have you decided to be nice?
Will such small kindnesses save you?
You want it on the floor?
No,
you did the right thing.
Who sent the cake?
We're taking some to all the teachers.
That's not what I asked.
Consider the question again.
And you're laughing.
You're funny, really funny.
The cake was cut and we did the rest.
Who sent it, who?
We did. Ourselves sir.
I brought the cake. My mother made it.
Ha!
Alright, I got it.
Isn't lipstick forbidden?
You're not graduating. Why dress up?
You're lucky I'm leaving or I'd really
give you a hard time.
Sorry.
As if everything was sorted out,
you apologize for lipstick?
I don't care, put on tar if you like.
No, don't close it.
Don't.
Leave it open.
Well,
this is how it ends, Sevim.
For me, I mean.
This story, this place.
It's time to forget what happened
and this dump.
Let's see how this tastes.
Sit down. Don't
stand there like a soldier.
It's good.
Cookie cake. I used to make it.
It's easy. I made it actually.
Really?
Well done.
There's something I wanted to talk
to you about.
It's no big deal, but since you're here.
Well,
actually, I wanted to ask you something.
Something I'm curious about.
Sit down.
If you like, I mean.
I requested a transfer.
You probably heard.
I'm leaving soon and won't be back.
So at times like this,
you tend to look back over everything.
Everything that's happened.
You wonder if there might be
anyone who's been hurt,
anyone who might need some last words
or an apology.
Considering I'll never return,
I was wondering if Sevim wanted
to tell me anything.
Get out.
Out.
Where was I?
Yes, since I'm going
and won't be back,
is there anything you might like
to say before I go,
dear Sevim?
Like what, sir?
I'm saying, I'm leaving
and won't be back next year.
If there's anything to say,
now's the time.
You'll never get another chance.
What kind of thing do you mean, sir?
I don't know. That's for you to know.
If you say you don't know,
that's also an answer.
It would mean
that you're a shallow person
who has no values.
And honestly, that'd upset me.
I'd feel a bit stupid for having cared
about you.
What I mean is,
you'd really upset and disappoint me.
Whether you meant to, I don't know.
Don't even care
about the reason anymore.
Because I realized
I still haven't figured people out.
I still haven't understood
who's worthy or not, who's special
and who isn't.
It was my biggest mistake,
if I ever made one.
So, you have nothing to say?
What should I say, sir?
Look at you.
Instead of being ashamed,
you're laughing.
I'm not laughing.
Whatever.
Don't worry.
I'm not blaming you.
What could you say
after all this, anyway?
What is there to say?
Okay.
Alright.
What's up?
May I go?
Sure. I have things to do anyway.
But you'll come to the celebration?
Alright, I will.
Come here. A bit closer.
After I left them,
I started walking up the hill covered
by dry grasses.
Thin dried up grasses I don't even know
the names of.
These nameless, humble grasses that
no one cares about
seemed important to me
for the first time,
for they are perceived as worthless,
like my life here.
Then I thought of Sevim,
what I looked for in her.
In this lifeless, motionless landscape,
what I was looking for in her
was perhaps something
I couldn't find in myself.
A kind of energy,
a tiny sign of transcendence.
I didn't dream of her, but beyond.
...I just wanted
to make her a means for a dream world
I had built beyond her.
But I knew
that between us
there was an abyss deep and wide enough
to choke our cries.
A distance too cruel
for our consciousnesses to approach.
I dreamed of the impossible.
And now,
I'm talking to her in my head again.
Sevim!
I lied to you last time we spoke.
Despite my efforts to convince myself,
I don't regret knowing you.
I wish I could see myself
through your eyes.
It's obvious you won't be like me
in the future,
you'll be a petulant, ferocious,
happy and hopeful woman
who can establish a closer,
more direct connection with life.
Because of this, I feel sorrow,
but I am also happy for you.
That's how life is.
Even this coincidence that
brought us together
is an astonishing mystery.
The feeling that arises as this idea
takes shape,
means all that happened cannot be
deemed worthless.
Yes.
Experiences, words,
and emotions,
are perhaps reflected
in some dark corridor of the universe.
But as it turns out,
the truth is as brutal as it is boring.
You'll realize this
like everyone else.
Time will pass,
and if you survive in this land of
unending setbacks,
you will still turn yellow
and dry up in the end.
You will find yourself at the midpoint
of your life,
and see you've gained nothing
but the desert inside you.
Nothing else.
