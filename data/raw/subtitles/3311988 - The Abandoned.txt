[indistinct chattering on radio]
        - Mostly cloudy,
     with scattered showers
and thunderstorms developing..
      - Big storm tonight.
       Don't mean to pry,
      but I can't imagine
      what a girl like you
    wants to do at the lots.
        [intense music]

   [cell phone keys beeping]
        [phone ringing]
           - Hello?
           - Mom. Hi.
         - You made it?
             - Yup.
    - Storm coming tonight.
        - Yeah, I heard.
      Can you put her on?
    - Julia...she's asleep.
         - Please, mom.
  Can you please call her over
  so I can tell her goodnight?
      - Julia, don't think
       about her tonight.
    - Well, if she wakes up,
  can you just please tell her
         that I called?
            - Okay.
        - Don't forget.
      - Focus on yourself.
   I don't have to remind you
  that this is your last chance
   or they'll take Clara away.
   - Yeah, I know that, mom.
        - Remember your
      breathing exercises.
            - Yeah.
  - I don't know how many more
    opportunities you'll get.
    - Yeah. Yeah, okay, mom.
          I gotta go.
         Alright, bye.
       [doorbell buzzing]
  - You're a student, correct?
          - Yes, sir.
        I'm gonna become
        a nurse someday.
 - Best of luck with all that.
     Around here, you work
      in the night shift.
    2 guards man every shift.
    1 guard on patrol duty,
   the other on the screens.
   - Wow. What is this place?
   - The building was erected
      during the big boom.
        Assumption being
    industry drives growth.
Growth brings up demand for more
   affordable luxury housing.
   Imagine living in a place
 providing everything you need
    for a comfortable life.
   You'd never have to leave.
  And as you know, boom became
     bust, and here we are.
        - What a waste.
- You have to be careful here,
         Ms. Streak.
   Things are starting to...
          fall apart.
   Ballroom, grand hall, gym
     mail and storage rooms
   plus a residential tower,
        30 floors high.
       As a patrol guard,
  you make sure nobody gets in
  nobody vandalizes the place,
      nothing bad happens
      to the structure...
  and nobody steals anything.
      - Does that happen?
        - All the time.
    Steal whatever they can
      get their hands on.
    We've been having issues
  of vagrancy, tryin' to make
     the place into a squat,
     so don't let anyone in.
This job pays well for a reason.
        The nights here
    can be long...and dark.
Some of the lights are on timer,
    so they turn off to save
           on power.
        The combination
 can make some people...uneasy.
      - I like the night.
  - We've blanketed the entire
 building with security cameras
  so we only need two guards.
 One on patrol and the other..
   - In front of the screens.
            Got it.
   Where's the control room?
          - Upstairs.
      I see your partner's
         already here.
     This is Dennis Cooper.
 He's been here since day one.
    - Hi. Nice to meet you.
    I'm Julia, but everybody
        calls me Streak.
        - That's great.
            - Nice.
      Cooper will take you
      through the controls.
    But I think you'll find
  the system pretty intuitive
    once you start using it.
      You'll go on patrol
     once every two hours.
Cooper will communicate with you
      using this headset.
      Packs a small camera
       and a microphone.
   Show us the feed, Cooper.
    [keyboard keys clacking]
         Simple enough?
Also, we've been having trouble
       with electricity.
      We lose a video feed
       from time to time
    so you'll have to throw
           a breaker.
           - Got it.
- You know what a breaker is?
            - Yup.
  - Don't forget the uniform.
That is the most important part
         of this job.
     - Have a great night.
    - There is a locker room
   in the back, to the right
   if you wanna change there.
Unless you feel more comfortable
    changing in here, which
     I could probably make
an exception for that...tonight.
         - I'm gonna go
      to the locker room.
            - Okay.
         [door closes]
      [instrumental music]
       [thunder rumbling]
  - This place is really big.
      A person could spend
      a lifetime in here.
- Well, most people don't last
      more than a week.
      - What's your story?
       - What's my story?
   My story. Um, let me see.
   It's a very long, detailed
     richly...boring tale.
      However, let's start
    with tonight's chapter.
     I guess it starts out
that I'm sick and tired of Dixon
       wheeling in some..
...local community college brat
  and expecting me to entertain
         them all night.
        That's my story.
'Cause tomorrow or the next day
  or possibly a week from now
but without question, it's going
 to happen, you're gonna decide
     that patrolling a big,
 empty building every two hours
 is not what was meant for you
         and your life
      and big aspirations.
    You're then gonna quit.
  Then Dixon's gonna bring in
  someone who's just like you
         and gonna sit
      right in that chair
         I'm gonna have
     the same conversation
    and be forced to babysit
     that person all night.
           - Really?
       - No tips, either.
       - This is gonna be
         a long night.
      - You have no idea.
       Sorry, sweetheart.
    Welcome to the big world
          of security.
  Excuse me. Time to lock up.
          Lights out.
        2, 3, 4. Ta-da.
           [gulping]
            [burps]
        [clears throat]
            - Gross.
   - It's weird. That happens
   every time I try to burp.
       What are you, 24?
            25? 23?
      Alright, we're just
   gonna stick with 24 then.
        - What, are you
       talking to me now?
        - Tough. Right?
  Bet you were a good student.
     Little teacher's pet.
          Am I right?
      Fit. Like your arms.
         You do a little
       self-defense maybe?
         Little karate?
    Little, uh, tae kwon do?
        Judo? Jiujitsu?
       Jell-O wrestling?
         Pillow fights?
       [exhales heavily]
       Kickboxing, maybe?
            - Yeah.
     Yeah, I do kickboxing.
 Yup. You have to for this job.
         - Ho-ho. Yeah?
           - Mm-hmm.
- Is that what Dixon told you?
   I must've missed that one.
        I can't kickbox.
           Guess what?
           You don't.
    I don't think I've seen
    one of these since 1982.
  My grandma had one of these.
    - Do not touch my stuff!
  - That's quick...kickboxer.
            [burps]
        Where you goin'?
           - Patrol.
- Not without this you're not.
       Goes on like this.

        [mouse clicking]
              Um..
     ...do you miss me yet?
     - What are you doing?
             - Me?
     I'm not doing anything.
        Just a little, uh
       welcome ceremony,
     a little initiation..
   ...to the security world.
       [buttons clicking]
    - Open the door, Cooper.
  Cooper, this is not a game.
            - Games?
       I don't play games.
      [breathing heavily]
          [footsteps]
    [indistinct whispering]
     [whispering continues]
     - Cooper, let me out!
       Cooper, let me out
        of the elevator!
  Please, Cooper, let me out!
        Please, Cooper!
     Please open the door!
            Cooper!
         Open the door!
   - Relax. I'm just testing
       the cut-off switch.
- Please open the door! Cooper!
  - Seems to be workin' fine.
            [gasps]
           [whirring]
           [panting]

          [footsteps]
      [instrumental music]
       [music continues]
    - I can see-e-e you-u-u.
   - I can't believe how huge
      and beautiful it is.
    - That's what she said.
    - This place is amazing.
   - You wanna see something
          even better?
    - Why should I trust you
        all of a sudden?
    - 'Cause I'm all you got
         tonight, babe.
        Go over your left
     and exit through there.
        Then your right,
     go down that corridor.
       [music continues]
        [dramatic music]
           [panting]
      [instrumental music]
       [thunder rumbling]
      - They really spared
          no expense.
       [thunder rumbling]
   And nobody will live here?
   - They never finished it.
    - It's so dark in here.
    Uh! What is that smell?
        [dramatic music]
           [screams]
              Uh!
         - First night,
     you found an intruder.
  Very promising, Ms. Streak.
            - Jerk.
          - This way.
         - Hey, Cooper,
       did you hear that?
          - Hear what?
        [intense music]
         - Never mind.
       [thunder rumbling]
           [beeping]
              Ah!
            [huffs]
        - Complimentary
    first night meal. Enjoy.
       - This looks like
         hospital food.
  - You know why hospital food
    tastes the way it does?
             - Why?
  - 'Cause it makes you wanna
    get out of the hospital.
        Think about that.
       - Uh, why are you
      being so nice to me?
     - I'm not being nice.
     That's company policy.
 In a few hours, your stomach's
       gonna be grumbling
        and you're gonna
       wanna fall asleep.
      You need that fuel.
        - She's pretty.
     Is that your daughter?
             - Yup.
     - Are you guys close?
             - Hey.
            Enough.
          - You know,
    I have a daughter, too.
            - Good.
      - Her name's Clara.

      How come I can't get
       441 on the screen?
   - Because there is no 441.
   - It says 441 right here.
    - They never got around
        to finishing it
 before they ran out of money.
 - Where's the circuit breaker
        for the cameras?
    - I said there's no 441.
       It doesn't matter
   what the blueprint says.
If anyone should know, it's me.
         I've been here
  since the beginning of time.
        - Well, someone
      should check it out.
     - That's a good idea,
    someone should do that.
So why don't you go down there?
Matter of fact, I'm telling you
       to go down there
      and don't come back
 until we have 441 on the grid.
   What are you waiting for?
       [snapping fingers]
        - Fine, I will.
            - Ah-ah.

   4-4-1-4-3-7-8-5-2. 4-4-1..
         4-3-7...8-5-2.
        Circuit breaker,
         where are you?
       4-4-1-4-3-7-8-5-2.
         [Streak sighs]

            [clangs]
        - You happy now?
            - Hello?
       Is someone there?
       Is somebody there?
         - You talkin'
        to the walls now?
     That what you're doin'?
       What are you doing?
           [clanking]
           - Nothing.
       [pounding on door]
    [indistinct whispering]
        [dramatic music]
       [door slams shut]
        - Keeping busy?
 - I heard something in there.
      - Yeah, what's that?
        - I don't know,
        behind the door.
    - There's nothing there,
        I told you that.
     - You knew about this,
          didn't you?
Why are there cameras down there
 and why were they turned off?
         - Because it's
     an unfinished section
        and they told us
     not to go down there.
   - There's something there.
         - Impossible.
            - There.
        Can you see it?
           [buzzing]
            Oh, God!
           [panting]
           I told you
     something's not right.
       [doorbell buzzing]
     - No, we have company.
      - What does he want?
    - Probably wants shelter
         for the night.
            [sighs]
      - What are we gonna
          do about it?
   - Well, one of us is gonna
      have to go down there
      and tell him to scram
  before he breaks that window.
           [no audio]
          And I guess
    that person will be me.
      - I didn't realize.
           - Save it.
     - I'm coming with you.
       - Oh, really? Now?
       [pounding on door]
          Sorry, buddy,
     you gotta turn around.
         - Please, man,
    it's so cold out there.
     I have no place to go.
         - Can't do it.
      - Come on, you have
     all that space in there
   and it just stands empty.
 I just need one night inside!
      - You gotta move on.
           I told you.
  The storm's gonna get worse.
        Find some place.
- Please, I'm begging you, man!
        I'm begging ya!
   I.. Honest, I mean no harm.
  I -- I -- I.. Honest to God.
        I just, just need
     one more night inside.
  I'll be gone before sunrise.
       No one will know.
  Please, man, I'm begging ya!
        I'm begging ya!
   - It's not my call. Sorry.
  Move. Streak, shut the door.
      Now! Shut it, Streak!
           - Come on!
            Come on.
   Hey, don't leave me here!
 Come on, have some compassion,
       man! Have a heart!
I'm gonna die out here tonight.
     I'm gonna die out here
      while you're inside!
And I hope you remember my face!
   And I hope you think of me
 before you go to bed at night!
     - What's he gonna do?
        He's an old man.
 We can't leave him like this.
     Have a heart, Cooper.
          - I said no.
        [intense music]
           - Please!
     - I'm letting him in.
       - No, you're not.
   - It's freezing out there.
        - I'm not losing
        my job for him.
   - You don't have to worry.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
          Thank you.
       [door slams shut]
          Nice doggie.
         It's good now.
             Yeah.
           I gotta..
         ...thank you.
      - You can stay here.
       - Oh, wow, yeah..
    - But you have to leave
        before sunrise.
            - Okay.
 - And don't go walking about.
  The entire building's wired
         with cameras.
       We won't hesitate
       to throw you out.
       What's your name?
             - Jim.
 - Look, Jim, I don't know you
     but I just put myself
     out on a limb for you
      and I need to know
you're not gonna screw me over.
       - Cross my heart.
       What's your name?
            - Julia.
       - I'm sorry about
     earlier today, Julia.
   I'm a good person, really.
     I'm not a bad person.
          - Prove it.
            - Okay.
        What's up, boy?
     What are you thinkin'?
              Huh?

           Oh, yeah.
           I think..
         ...it is-s-s.
             Yeah.
           [rustling]
  Let's see. One, two, three.
   And dump it back in there.
  Let's see if we can do this.
           One, two..
     Oh, the hell with it.
              Mmm.
      [breathing heavily]
- Cooper, are you seeing this?
     Cooper, are you there?
         Hello, Cooper?
        [water running]
  - What are you saying, boy?
Oh, you wanna go out for a walk.
           [barking]
    You heard the nice lady
        they'll throw us
    back out into the storm!

           [clanging]
             [thud]
            - Hello?
        Is anyone there?
           [rattling]
           [clanging]
         [eerie music]
     Cooper, are you there?
           [buzzing]
    - I hear your plan, boy.
             Yeah.
         [dog barking]
             Yeah.
      [barking continues]
       [music continues]
      What is this place?
         [dog barking]
      [breathing heavily]
        [dramatic music]
      [breathing heavily]
    [indistinct whispering]
            - Hello?
          - This way.
            - Hello?
      [breathing heavily]
            [yells]
        [Streak gasping]
        [intense music]
      [breathing heavily]
       [music continues]
       [music continues]
           [screams]
        [doll laughing]
   [Streak breathing heavily]
      - Streak, you okay?
   - Where the hell were you?
          - I was, uh,
    taking care of some, uh..
      ...some manly duties.
         Where the hell
       are you right now?
- I'm in a shelter downstairs!
   Have you seen this place?
     - It doesn't look like
        anything to me.
         - There's like
       all these drawings!
     It's like a dormitory
         or something!
 Did you know about this place?
     - I was told not to go
     in there, so were you.
        Get back up here.
      - There's something
 still living here, I know it.
     - Streak, did you shut
  the shelter door behind you?
           - No. Why?
    - Because somebody did.
      I told you not to let
   that piece of shit in here.
         - Oh, no, no!
        Oh, no, no, no!
      [breathing heavily]
    [indistinct whispering]
         It's not him.
    - Oh, it's not? Really?
Who locked the door, the wind?
     - Please just help me
         find the exit.
      [breathing heavily]
       - Can you remember
        how you came in?
      - You can't tell me?
 - There are no cameras there.
   I told you that, remember?
      I've no idea to know
         where you are.
- It's too dark in here to see!
   - Hold still for a minute.
         And just relax.
      Can you see anything?
      [breathing heavily]
   A light, an arch, a chair
       something familiar
  you remember on the way in.
  - Everything looks the same.
       - What was that?
            - What?
         Cooper, what?
           - Nothing.
         I -- I thought
      that I saw something.
    - Stop messing with me.
  - I'm not messing with you.
         Must have been
    video interference here.
         It went black.
   - I'm in control of myself
    and I won't have my mind
       play tricks on me.
    I'm in control of myself
        and I won't have
   my mind play tricks on me.
    I'm in control of myself
        and I won't have
  my mind play tricks on me..
    - Stop. Look. Go towards
    the back and to the left.
    I think if you go that --
        - You're wrong.
      I know where to go.
      - What do you mean?
      - I know where I am.
    [keyboard keys clacking]
           - Streak..
     Streak, listen to me.
     I -- I can't see you.
      If you can hear me,
           don't move
   stay right where you are.
 Do not move. I'm coming down.
          - This way.
        [dramatic music]
          [screaming]
       [music continues]
           [gasping]
           [panting]
        - What happened?
           [panting]
       You okay? You see?
  That homeless piece of shit
 that you let in locked you in.
        - It wasn't him.
            - Right.
We're gonna find him right now.
We're gonna escort his ass out.
    He's gonna sleep tonight
          in a puddle.
    - There's something else
   in there. It was not him.
       - Something? What?
       Hundred bucks says
       he left his room.
  Come on, let's go find out.
             - Jim?
       [thunder rumbling]
        - He's not here.
    And that's why you keep
 this scum outside, understand?
       - Where you going?
 - I'm gonna try to catch him,
         save our jobs.
            [clicks]
 - Come on, boy. Come on, boy.
            Come on.
       Take it easy, boy.
   Come on, boy. Come on up.
  Come on, boy. Come on, boy.
           [whooshes]
            Come on.
           [clicking]
          [whooshing]
           [clicking]
      [electrical buzzing]
      [buzzing continues]
              Boy?
          Is that you?
           Oh.. Boy?
         What the hell?
           [creaking]
     What do you know? Yeah.
             Yeah!
        [dramatic music]
           What the..
           [screams]
          [screaming]
          [screeching]
        [dramatic music]
           [rustling]
       [thunder rumbling]
   - I can't breathe in this.
    [keyboard keys clacking]
   I'm locking this place up.
      - Well, I can't find
     this scumbag anywhere
    and that's unacceptable.
              Shit.
          - Found it.
     - Wellville, a center
     for physically deformed
     and mentally challenged
            children.
           Last week,
     I received a phone call
    from an anonymous source
        complaining about
  the treatment of the children
       hospitalized here.
          So I decided
     to show up unannounced.
And what you're about to see..
     ...are some of the most
      disturbing images...
        ...this reporter
       has ever witnessed.
       We were told to go
 straight down to the basement
    where the institute holds
  some of its youngest patients
      many of them orphans.
        And what we found
         was horrifying.
          [shuddering]
           [groaning]
      [instrumental music]
       Kids, some as young
      as five years of age
    left unattended for hours
    in this grizzly basement.
       We found one child
    covered in his own feces
          sitting alone
     on the bathroom floor.
        [child panting]
- We don't need to watch this.
           - Wait.
 - The man at the helm of this
    institute, Dr. Thorndike
points a finger at the county.
    - You have to understand
          nobody else
     wants these children.
    - Well, it doesn't seem
   that you want them either.
     - We're low on staff.
      We're low on budget.
   - Then how do you respond
       to the allegations
         of malpractice?
      - It's preposterous.
    We have some of the best
 and most qualified physicians
        in the country.
  - Dr. Thorndike, is it true
   that some of your patients
   have been victims of abuse
and neglect at this institute?
     - Alright, that's it.
        We're done here.
     - So we leave today..
       ...but the children
           stay behind
     unable to cry for help
    so we must cry for them.
      I'm Warren Rawlings.
        Back to you, Bob.
      [instrumental music]
       - These poor kids.
         They probably
   spent their life in there.
       I could sense it,
      they're still there.
         - He's the one
       who locked you in.
  You got confused and scared.
  You're a very confused girl.
 - I'm telling you what I saw.
   - Enough already. Enough!
      I know your problem.
 - What are you talking about?
           [rattling]
   You went through my stuff?
         - Yeah, I did.
   Because somehow something
wasn't just quite right tonight.
 Something didn't smell right.
 Because in all my years here,
    one night shift with you
     has created more havoc
 than anything I've ever seen.
     Did you not take your
   three anti-psychotic pills
         this evening?
- That's none of your business.
       - Oh, it is now.
     - Look, I'm not crazy.
         My whole life
 I've been able to sense things
     that I can't describe.
        And when I told
      the doctor about it
   he put me on these pills.
And if I don't take these pills
       then they're gonna
        take Clara away.
     - Your daughter Clara?
       You can't do this.
    This job is not for you.
   This is not right for you.
   This building at night --
        - I'm not crazy.
    I am not crazy, Cooper.
       I know what I saw.
    Please, I am not crazy!
             Look.
 We gotta call him out of there
      and then we've gotta
         shut the door.
  We can't let those kids out.
           We've gotta
     shut the door, Cooper.
Cooper, please, I'm begging you.
Please, we gotta shut the door.
- Because spirits can't travel
        through doors?
          Is that why?
    - You don't understand.
    I have seen some things
      down there, Cooper.
 I have seen things down there.
    - You're gonna sit down.
   You're not going anywhere.
           - Why not?
  - Because you're delusional,
          that's why.
  You've done enough tonight.
         - Cooper, I --
     - I'm not letting you
          out of here.
             - Why?
      - Because you're not
        thinking right.
Because you put me in jeopardy.
    Because I need this job.
   I don't have anywhere else
             to go!
     You can take your pill
    and go fool someone else
      like you fooled me!
            I can't.
    No pill...changes this.
       Do you understand?
        - I'm so sorry.
          - Don't be.
    I don't need your pity.
  Are you fucking kidding me?
  - They won't leave us alone
unless we shut the door, Cooper.
           - Or what,
     you're gonna stun me?
       - I'm gonna do it.
         - Put it down.
    You're not gonna do it.
        No, you're not,
 because it's just gonna prove
  that you're crazy and you're
     gonna lose everything.
       - Please, Cooper,
    I'm begging you. Please.
        - I'll go down.
          I'll go down
    and I'll shut the door.
             Okay?
              Okay?
             Okay?
      See? That's better.
 - What are you doing? Cooper?
   Cooper, no! Don't leave me
       like this, please!
 - I'm not taking any chances.
    Can't trust you anymore.
    - Please hurry, Cooper!
           Please I..
      Don't leave me alone!
            Cooper.
            - What?
   - Don't take the elevator.
          - Seriously?
        [intense music]
      [keyboard clacking]
      [elevator whirring]
          Oh, come on.
        Streak, did you
    touch anything up there?
   - I'm not doing anything.
            [clangs]
        [elevator thuds]
            [sighs]
      - Goddamn generator.
   - It's not the generator.
Maybe we should call someone.
     - That's a good idea.
 That way we can both be fired
  and thrown out in the storm
with the homeless piece of shit
     that you let in here.
     Maybe you can tell 'em
       your ghost stories
       that'll amuse 'em.
         I'm gonna try
     to pry this thing open
    and get to the breaker.
           [grunting]
 - Don't do it. It's not safe.
           [grunting]
        [intense music]
           [whirring]
     Cooper, it's closing.
           Watch out!
           [whirring]
             - Uh!
           - Cooper!
      [whirring continues]
            [clangs]
        [intense music]
           [panting]
       [music continues]
            [huffs]
     Cooper, are you okay?
      - Yeah, I'm alright.
You know, there's only one thing
          I wanna know
    that I don't understand.
         - What's that?
       When you were down
        in that shelter
        how did you know
    where the entrance was?
        How did you know
        which way to go?
        - I don't know.
    [indistinct whispering]
      - Did you hear that?
          - Hear what?
          Oh, my God.
       Cooper, you gotta
       get out of there.
        [dramatic music]
- Well, can you see something?
        [intense music]
       What did you see?
          - The kids.
          They're out.
    [indistinct whispering]
    Cooper, can you hear me?
    - There's no such thing
           as ghosts.
      Or your mumbo-jumbo
      getting in my head.
     Just had a few drinks.
    [indistinct whispering]
             Wait.
    [indistinct whispering]
             Yeah.
Well, let's get this over with.
           - In here.
         [dog panting]
     - I can hear the dog.
           Hey, boy.
          [whistling]
        Come on out now.
  Come on, boy. Come here now.
           Goddammit.
           [whistles]
    I'm not going in there.
              Hey!
      If you're in there..
   ...it's your last chance.
    I'm shutting this door.
      [wheelchair rattles]
     [wheelchair rattling]
            [grunts]
       - Close the door!
       - What's going on?
        What's going on?
     [wheelchair rattling]
        What's going on?
              Ow!
     - What are you doing?
       Don't go in there!
    [indistinct whispering]
     - I can't control it.
         - Cooper, no!
        - I can't stop!
             - No!
    Cooper, can you hear me?
           [panting]
          No, no, no.
              Oh..
            Please.
            [grunts]
            Come on!
        [dramatic music]
    Come on! Please, please.
              Uh..
       Open. Please open.
    Please, please, please.

         - Who's that?
             Hello?
         - Are you one
        of the grown-ups?
      [footsteps thumping]

        [intense music]
   - Cooper, can you hear me?
           [panting]
  Hi, boy! You're a good boy!
     You're gonna help me!
      You're gonna tell me
      where he is, right?
        [intense music]
       Come on, come on.
            Go! Go!
       Come on, let's go!
           [panting]
      [breathing heavily]
         [dog panting]
     Cooper, are you there?
            Cooper.
            Cooper.
            Cooper?
Cooper, can you hear me? Cooper?
            Cooper?

          Oh, please!
  Please don't do this to me!
            Please!
            [crying]
            - Julia?
        [intense music]
      They're never gonna
         let you leave.
        - Who are they?
         - My friends.
     - Why? Why would they
         do this to me?
  - They don't like grown-ups.
- Is it because of this place?
 - Do you want me to show you?
        [dramatic music]

      [instrumental music]
 Some of us tried to run away.
        [siren wailing]
       [music continues]
       [music continues]
 - Where are they taking them?
        [water running]
      [instrumental music]
       [music continues]
   - The grown-ups lock them
   in here to keep them quiet.
    They drank the bad water.
   When the grown-ups arrived,
        it was too late.
        - They all died?
       - Except for one.
         - Mama! Mama!
             Mama!
          - No! Clara!
             - No!
           - No! No!
          No, my baby!
         - Don't do it!
         It's not her.
              No!
      [instrumental music]
        [dramatic music]
        [Cooper grunts]
        [Streak gasping]
    We gotta get outta here!
      - Let's go, Cooper!
             - Ah!
         - No! Cooper!
      Cooper, no! No! No!
          No, Cooper!
     Don't let go! No! No!
             - Go!
       - Cooper! Cooper!
        - Don't let go!
          - Go! Get..
         - Cooper! No!
