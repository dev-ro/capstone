Until you sell your soul to the devil,
the devil will keep trying to buy it.
Next Monday,
three hours.
To enjoy my angel
before I go home to Lebanon.
I can't.
Now you can.
Ever been to Beirut, Lisa?
There's no more Lisa.
Today was my last time.
See you Monday, Lisa.
They can't do that to you.
They can't throw you out
on the street.
How much do you owe?
Four months, soon to be five.
What's that? Three grand?
I'll get it for you.
You've caused us enough trouble
with that shit!
You must be able to do anything
for your agent.
Spend hours, days, weeks with him
without going home.
Know his wife, parents,
kids' names and birthdays.
Put your life on hold for him.
What you can't do
is to see him as a human being.
An agent isn't a human,
he's a weapon.
Yes, it's some great news,
by the grace of Allah.
Our emir, the Mujahid Sheikh
and Lion of Islam,
Osama bin Laden,
may Allah protect him,
has instructed me
to give the good news
to the Muslim masses
and my brothers the Mujahideen
of the union of the Salafist Group
for Preaching and Combat
with the group Qaeda al-Jihad.
Praise be to Allah,
praise be to Allah!
And we thank Allah
for this blessed union
which will be a bone
in the throats
of the U.S. and French crusaders
and their allies
and inspire distress,
concern and dejection
in the hearts of the apostate
sons of France.
And we ask Him
to guide our brothers...
Why's he say France?
It causes our brothers
to suffer.
France colonized our lands
and outlaws our sisters
wearing hijab.
Get out!
Go on, get out!
France fights our Afghan brothers,
prints caricatures of the Prophet...
May He be blessed and praised.
Do you have arguments
in favor of France?
They have Zidane.
He's the best.
That's the best the West has.
France is guilty
and we will make them pay.

D.G.S.E HQ
Jan 13, 2008. 9 AM meeting.
Tape starts. Present are
Heads of Strategy, Intelligence and Operations.
Go ahead.
An undercover agent in Damascus
overheard five men
targeting France
for their next attack.
- Reliable source?
- Top quality.
Evaluation?
70% probability.
Bring me the agent's file.
Get me 15 minutes
with the President's office.
Tell them
there's an imminent threat.
"Imminent" as in "won't materialize"?
What do I care!
You don't.
But if the unthinkable happens,
you'll shed a little tear
before informing the President.
I'm sure he'll understand.
Your source is in the Middle East?
Is your source based
in the Middle East?
Yes, sir, of course it is.
Do you want to know where?
You know we're trying to cozy up
to the regime.
We can't risk
a diplomatic incident.
I quite understand, sir.
Let them terrorize us,
so we can stay friends.
What do you want, Fouche?
Infiltrate their home base.
I need a provision
from Special Funds. 3 million.
You won't get anything
until you prove the threat is real.
Proof of a threat?
That's called a bombing.
Institute

Yalidzin, 11/20.
Passable.
Le Sentier, 6/20. Clarify your ideas.
Asloum, 10/20. Better.
Sibaut, almost 0.
Bellanger, nearly but not quite.
9.5/20.
I have to repeat
a semester for that?
For half a point?
Your Arabic's poor.
Did you really expect to pass?
I was half a point off passing!
You can't do this, sir!
If you want, I'll give you 5,
then you'll have no regrets.
If I don't get my degree,
I can't work at Alliance Fran√ßaise.
6 months translating
in the Emirates. A real job!
Drache, 16. Very good.
Mr. Djouri,
please give me another chance.
I'll sit the exam again...
Arab proverb: "When diplomacy fails,
send a woman."
French proverb: "Dream on!"
That really sucks, what he did.
If it's any consolation,
it's not just you. He's a bastard.
My name's Jeremy.
I'll back you up...
Thanks, but I'm a big girl now.
Really? What's a big girl like?
Too old for you.
I shouldn't have followed you,
but when I saw you...
What don't you understand in "no"?
How long will you live?
110,
120 years?
I ask for 2 hours.
Out of 120 years,
2 hours for me?
To get to know you, where
you're from, where you're going.
After that, I'll leave you alone.
Two tiny hours.
Lille
Northern suburbs
Get outta my face!
- 5 grams? 10 grams?
- Give me 20.
- Not 50 like last week?
- No, too much.
- 50's good.
- No, 20!
- Go on, 50's good.
- Give me 20.
- The cash!
- Don't bust my balls.
- The cash first.
- Go get it.
Give me the cash.
Let's see the dope.
I'll go get it, okay?
Fuck it!
Police! Stop, asshole!
Don't touch, fuckwit!
Shut up!
- You see the new guy?
- Where?
The new guy, gray jacket.
Beat it!
Beat it, I said!
Get the hell outta here!
Hey, cutie...
You new here?
Want to be my bitch?
Stop!
For fuck's sake, stop!
Not that!
Not that! Stop!
My name's Aziz.
My boys saw them.
Look at me.
What's going on?
Nothing, we're mopping the floor.
Boss, if you want him to last
more than two weeks,
he's gonna need protection.
Pack up, you're moving.
This is your new home.
Shift!
Make room for the new guy.
You're on my territory, and here
we don't abandon our brothers.
- What time is it?
- 7.
See you tonight.
- Happy birthday, son.
- Dad, big surprise.
You don't seem very happy
to see your father.
It's not that. We're having a party.
I wasn't expecting you.
It's cool.
I'm glad to meet you.
Dad, this is Diane.
The one who's stolen his heart?
Wonderful!
Okay, thanks for coming...
You can't leave now.
Would you like a drink?
Very friendly.
I'm always on the road, selling wine
to foreigners with no taste.
Jeremy said you have to repeat
a year. That must be a pain.
A great job, a trip
and a year of my life up in smoke.
- I'll find something else.
- I'm sure you will.
You can go back to your old job.
By the way,
did your friend Lisa
stay in Grenoble
or did you bring her with you?
I don't know anyone called Lisa.
What is this?
The wig's
so no one would recognize you?
Look...
Turning tricks to pay for college,
rent, food, what do I care!
But my son's in love with you.
He'd hate to know who you are.
- Leave him now...
- Or?
I get a fine? Lose my license?
We can find a compromise.
Jeremy!
- What?
- Over here.
Diane has bad news for you.
She's going on the road...
As my interpreter.
Now I'll understand my Arab clients.
You idiots, you scared me.
Right, I better be going.
Okay, Diane.
6 AM, Monday.
I'll pick you up.
Happy birthday, son.
You're really gonna work with him?
Be right back.
Do you often
drag people out of their beds?
Get off my case!
Interpreting for a wine rep!
I'm not interested, okay?
Who mentioned interpreting?
What the hell is this?
Where are we?
You won't answer me?
Where are we?
- Get out.
- What?
Get out. Room 12.
Not there, you'll be in my way.
Stay seated.
My name is Alex.
This is the D.G.S.E.,
French secret services.
Today, you start training
as contact officers.
To be operational,
6 things to remember...
Live undercover with the discipline
it entails.
Learn to operate dead-drops.
Maintain your legend
to fit in with your cover.
Learn to tail without being seen.
Be fluent in your target's language.
Learn basic self-defense.
Sir?
About self-defense...
Right.
I want the assailant's size,
eye color, weapon used,
number of shots fired and hits,
and anything about Leila,
who will be your instructor
for the next 6 months.
Good intelligence means tying up
information with known facts.
Type in your name.
You don't get here on talent alone.
We run a check on you.
Shit, it's gibberish.
You read this?
Hands off my Koran
unless you wash and ask permission.
Got that?
You're interested in the law?
The law?
Fuck the law!
It got me 6 months in here.
I'm talking about Sharia law.
The only true way.
Once you know the way...
You don't get lost anymore.
You're a quick study.
Which job provides the best cover?
Lawyer, accountant or dentist?
Lawyer's too risky.
Access to secrets
makes you a target.
Good.
Dentist's the best cover.
People trust
an educated health professional.
I'd say dentist's the worst, too.
You intimidate people
and if they ask you
to extract a molar, you're burned.
Your true identity is in the umma,
the community.
Your brothers protect you
and you protect them.
- Against who?
- Guys like you.
Why?
Because you're not a brother yet,
my brother.
If you're followed, you must be able
to transform in seconds.
She's headed your way.
What's with men?
Bastards! Screw 'em!
Where the hell is she?
I can't see her.
- You're not in Bordeaux?
- I wanted to see you too bad.
Different, and much better.
It's the same one.
I promise you.
- It's still the same bottle.
- No way!
- It is.
- No way.
My first mission,
so I have to dress up?
The guy at the bar.
Patrick.
Three kids.
Faithful husband of 8 years.
Compromise him.
Bring me his wedding ring.
Hold on, I'm through with all that.
You'd mess up your 1st mission?
Put your wedding ring in my mouth.
I'll put something else in there.
Please...
Can't you just give me your ring?
Please.
I tried.
I honestly tried, but I can't anymore.
You understand?
A question of method.
That's why you failed.
We train operatives,
not whores.
You hate me
because I'm sleeping with your son?
I don't know what you mean.
What do I tell Jeremy
if he asks about my day?
To trust you.
To lie, trust is essential.
Well?
Are they deaf?
No, worse. If it's not in Paris,
they don't believe it.
Bearded fools and asses in suits,
as bad as each other.
Operation Shard.
Small...
Small and invisible.
I want your ideas within 48 hours.
You're reporting directly to me.
What about funding?
Use the usual laundering system.
Just avoid banks in Luxemburg.
I'll need good people,
not rookies.
See if Aline's done with Chad
and check out Ahmed, he's...
A problem for you?
Yes.
And a problem
that it's a problem?
Yes.
How does it feel having a problem
with 10% of the country you defend?
Meeting in the situation room.
Our experts have analyzed
the latest intelligence.
Khaled Ibn Ahbad
could be a member of the family.
Egyptian, Muslim Brother,
years in jail
for his part
in Sadat's assassination.
It's going to be chemical.
You're flying to Germany, doctor.
No, the medication
you wish to order from us
contain extractable cyanide.
Our security services...
Your daughter?
I wish her a long, happy life.
Without accidents.
Muhammad al-Haj.
Jordanian doctor.
Took part in attacks in Saudi Arabia.
His cover is Amman hospital.
Appointed Director in '98.
A radical Salafist.
Like Khaled Ibn Ahbad.
They met through a guy
working undercover in Africa.
His name's Salem al-Qatba.
Sudanese.
Member of the Islamic Courts Union.
Close to the Taliban, he disappeared
before popping up in Iraq.
Probably
one of the network's gofers.
As for the two others, nothing.
Our source had never seen them.
We need to know
what they're planning.
Let's get busy.
We demand that France
withdraw its forces from Afghanistan
and all the lands of Islam
within three months.
Or else the next victims
won't be dogs.
How did you get it?
A USB key sent
to our station chief in Beirut.
Find out all the tape can tell us.
They know we won't withdraw
from Lebanon or Afghanistan.
The ultimatum is 3 months.
Is that to keep us guessing?
No, the Salafists warn the infidel
of his punishment...
When he says
"France withdraw its forces",
you can tell he's from N.E. Lebanon.
The speaker is a Sunni...
His pronunciation of vowels
and consonants is typical of...
Jihadists read the verses
as revoking tolerance...
Yellow means death
for the Shiites...
It probably died
of respiratory failure...
It could be transformed cyanide...
With cold explosives,
it makes the perfect chemical bomb.
Who said anything about bombs?
One of those in the Metro,
you're looking at 50-200 dead.
Not good enough! Find a poison
to teach hell a lesson.
You asked me for cyanide.
We've been wasting our time.
Now the French will waste theirs,
looking for cyanide
in the tiniest shampoo bottles.
And the martyr?
Not one of our brothers,
one of theirs.
It's a powerful symbol.
An infidel?
How can an infidel fight Jihad?
He who converts
is no longer an infidel.
You follow me?
Slim, you okay?
What's up?
Nothing, as usual.
Do I look good or do I look good?
You never say a word,
so I figured you were stupid.
Now I know you only submit
to God. We're the same.
You're a real man.
And you're a real fool.
You're headed for a big fall.
Muscles and territory
don't make me strong.
I'm talking to you!
My only strength is to shut
my mouth and act like one of them.
If Aziz ever sees through me...
I'm scared.
I count the days and I shut up.
You know, kid,
not everybody's like Aziz in here.
Go on, throw!
Pay up.
Give me 20.
You haven't paid.
A fifth of my winnings
is for the community.
You said Islam bans gambling.
You said your Ma was flat broke.
Listen up! Never talk
about my mother like that.
I was wrong about you.
I had you down as weak,
but you acted like a real Muslim.
- Why? Are there fake ones?
- Sure.
Guys who submit to a man
rather than God.
They're jahilin.
Like me...
if I don't protect my reputation.
Again.
Why did Alex recruit you?
That's my business.
Why did Alex recruit you?
Who's Alex?
Who gave me a dumb bitch like her?
Alex.
I'm screwing his son.
Why did Alex recruit you?
Slap me now
'cos you won't get an answer.
There you go.
However scared or stressed,
keep control.
You okay?
You believed me, huh?
When I said I was screwing his son.
Search! Everybody out!
- Slow down!
- Get out!
Take it easy.
What's this?
Where'd you get it?
Hands off the Koran!
It's cool, boss. Everything's okay.
Shut up!
Get off, you fuckers!
Get off me!
Your grub.
I don't eat pork!
I don't eat pigs like you!
Fucking hell!
I wanna see my mother!
Let me out!
Wanna see my mother.
Paris
D.G.S.E. Headquarters
Abu Ghadab means
Father of Wrath.
He's used it since '98.
His real name's
Arzam Taha al-Bharad.
Lebanese,
born in Saida in '54,
he started out
in the ranks of Osbat al-Ansar,
then hooked up
with Abu Nidal's F.C.R.
The group became a sub-contractor
for operations against the West.
Sorry I'm late.
No problem,
as long as it's not ten times a day.
The prayer's five times a day, sir.
Your job's 50 hours a week.
Speaks 5 languages,
including Hebrew and French.
In 1998, the Brits logged him
as active in Damascus.
But after 9/11, al-Bharad
lost influence in Salafist circles.
A major attack in Europe
would restore his prestige
after he was shut out
of the London and Madrid bombings.
Find me a weak point.
I don't care what.
What did the Brits want to trade?
Information on Chadia Daoud.
Amman
March 3, 2008
A woman wants to meet Danar.
She says she's ready for the struggle
and is loyal to our cause.
She says a lot.
Who is she?
An Algerian, in France for 11 years.
She's built a financial network
that supports an NGO
called Children of the Desert.
She's used it as cover
for operations against the West
and even France.
Her name's Chadia Daoud.
Take off your veil.
Are you ready to do what we ask?
We need genuine French passports.
Can you earn our trust?
Trust?
You're too smart
to use dirty words, brother.
I'll do what you ask in Paris
on one condition.
I want to meet Abu Ghadab.
Abu Ghadab doesn't believe
in women in the Jihad.
Tell him women die like men
when they fight for Allah.
Take one.
They'll remind you of home.
If you do a good job in Paris,
I'll intervene in your favor.
Algeria...
The taste of my childhood.
A controversy has been sparked
by the decision
to reinforce the French contingent
in Afghanistan.
The deputies were out in force
in Parliament.
Thierry Curtet reports.
Died so there would never be
another 9/11.
Died to make the world
a safer place.
Where's Slim?
You won't be seeing Slim
anytime soon.
He got parole.
Hungry?
Join me
and people will say you're crazy,
a fundamentalist,
a fanatic, a sicko.
But they won't look down on you.
You'll be part of a family.
Now, you're one of us.
We just need to find you a name.
My brother.
What are you wearing?
I got out this morning.
Cold, huh?
Why didn't you visit me in jail?
It's not like you don't have time.
I've got good news, you know.
I found a job.
Deliveryman at the supermarket.
It doesn't pay much,
but we'll get by.
You found people who'll trust you?
Don't you believe me?
Look, the boss trusts me enough
to give me two days in advance.
Which supermarket is it?
The one off the roundabout.
500 euros for two days?
Go on, get out.
- What's wrong?
- Get the hell out!
Get out!
I'm doing this for you.
I don't give a damn!
Take your shitty rags
and get the hell out!
It's for you
I go to all this trouble!
Go! Get out!
I never want
to see you again, Pierre.
My name's not Pierre.
My name's Aziz.
Any sign of the contact?
They said it'd be a blonde.
2 o'clock,
the blonde by herself.
Not in 4-inch heels.
What did they teach you?
Not to wait 50'
for your contact.
If I go, it's goodbye Chadia Daoud
and Abu Ghadab.
To my left, blue sweater?
There's a guy behind you.
Leila?
What's that noise?
I can't hear you.
- He slipped me a cellphone.
- Can you hear me?
Answer me, please.
Follow the ball.
Which one? Which ball?
In front of you.
Keep going.
Hand over the passports in 10 yards.
When and where
do I meet Abu Ghadab?
Keep going, I said.
The passports...
When and where?
Look, you have no choice.
Don't be an idiot, hand them over.
To think I didn't believe in women
in the Jihad...
Beirut, in one week.
- Stop it.
- I want you.
I have to take you back.
It's the protocol.
Let's protocol at my place.
Just one hour.
I'm taking you back.
Alex's orders.
Seeing how he treats you...
Come on.
Let's go to mine.
Screw Alex!
Make the most of me
before I go over to the enemy.
- Come on!
- I can't. Honestly.
- You can.
- Stop it.
Please, cut it out.
What?
Nothing, I'll be right up.
For failing to inform your superiors
of your liaison with "Mirage"
and ignoring the security protocol,
you are considered responsible
for her elimination.
"You will be taken into detention
forthwith,
"pending disciplinary measures
after investigation of the charges."
Ahmed, I hope you believe me,
this is not about your prayers.
It never even crossed my mind.
All because he had a private life.
You know he's a patriot.
Who maybe gave Leila away.
Do we have analysis of the explosive
that killed Mirage?
The explosive was inside the lock.
It's a trademark
of Syrian overseas operations.
Al-Bharad, the man she was due
to meet, is currently in Damascus.
How did you know?
I served her a delicious chamia.
100% Syrian.
Algeria...
The taste of my childhood.
If a Syrian cake reminds an Algerian
of her childhood,
she can't be Algerian.
And if she wasn't Algerian...
How did she contact us?
Through al-Haj?
You should have kept her
until I gave you orders.
She was worth nothing.
The living are always more useful
than the dead.
Eliminate al-Bharad.
You have 3 days.
That means
we risk leaving our signature.
It'd be disastrous.
Disastrous to think
we'd eliminate the threat with him.
15,000 al-Bharads in the Mid East
are desperate to replace him.
What do you recommend?
Our man in Beirut
got the security tape
of al-Bharad's old apartment block.
You want to send him a honey trap?
Anyone in mind?
Your contract with the State.
If you sign it,
make no plans for the next 5 years.
You leave for Beirut in 10 days.
Can I go see Jeremy?
Don't tell him where you're going.
We're friends of Pierre's.
Do you know where he is?
Is that it? Am I an agent now?
An employee of the State.
I'm doing it for me.
Nobody else.
We all have our reasons.
Have you found yours?
You knew it was a trap, asshole!
That's why you didn't go up.
I didn't know.
Al-Bharad speaks 5 languages,
including Hebrew and French.
His right-hand men are
Khaled, Danar, Muhammad al-Haj...
More on al-Haj.
42, Jordanian, Director and surgeon
at Amman Hospital.
There's the box.
Next time you order a termination
on my patch, tell me.
I had to respond, or I'd lose
our people's trust. Man management.
Who recommended Ahmed to me?
Great man management, sir.
What do you think?
I think he's clean.
Straight up.
Keep going.
Who's your handler?
To the house.
Who?
Delphine Boileau, born in Orleans
in 1982. Social Security No. 282...
St. Emilion has been a UNESCO
World Heritage site since 1988.
'99.
Try again.
- Shit! I'll never do it.
- Again!
What are you stopping for?
- Contact zone?
- Ashrafieh, Shatila, Hamra.
- Shiite sector?
- South suburbs.
What the hell!
What were you trying to do?
You must be blind!
What's wrong with you?
You're nuts!
It's not working.
We're gonna lose him.
Hit me, you asshole!
Watch where you're going!
What's your problem?
Okay...
That's enough.
West Beirut
Hamra district
Good evening.
So, tell me, why wine?
It's always been my passion.
I got it from my Dad.
So when I was offered this job,
I couldn't say no.
My respects, ma'am.
Your wish is my command, sir.
The lady will choose,
she knows her stuff.
Give me a Ksara Comte '98.
To drink with the gentleman
who wonders if I know what to pick.
I'm a wealthy man
and Lebanon is a dangerous country.
I need to know who I'm with.
And here, wine is not a job
for women.
In my country,
it's so much more than a job.
We have very good wines
in Lebanon, also.
Funny you should say so.
Lebanese wine has a full body...
You look like you've seen a ghost.
French wine has a fine reputation,
I'm sure you know.
Lisa?
Is it you?
No, I'm Delphine.
I don't know anyone called Lisa.
Is she your date?
Watch out for her.
$300 an hour.
- She's a devil...
- You being a pimp
doesn't make me a whore!
Leave us alone. Go!
What?
Didn't your whore speak Arabic?
Which match do you want to see?
The Paris team's schedule
has a lot of good matches
and our player's been chosen.
I booked for June 18.
That's the final.
The tickets are in the safe.
I hope the final will be good.
Do you often make calls
when you're with a woman?
That depends on the woman.
Did you hear him say "safe"?
"The tickets are in the safe"?
Yes.
And he said there's a match
on June 18?
He said nihaya. The final.
There are no finals in June.
All sports seasons end in May.
I'll see what I can find.
Whatever,
as long as you stay close to him.
And the guy who recognized me?
What can I say? How was I to know
you'd screwed half of Beirut?
Al-Ghuraba camp
200 kms south of Kabul
When you blow yourself up, ensure
the crowd doesn't limit the explosion.
At this camp,
you will forget your former lives.
Here, you will become soldiers.
Here, we will prepare you
for martyrdom.
Then, we'll send you to lands
where hypocrites and infidels
inflict all kinds of cruelty
on Muslims.
I don't get a word of it.
For a real Mujahid,
to fight is to die.
God is great!
Faster!
Or else I'll kick your ass!
Move it!
Move it, you faggot!
1, 2, 3, 4...
Faster, you idiot!
You killed al-Haj.
You're the traitor!
VX, the most powerful neurotoxin.
10 milligrams
is enough to kill a person
weighing 70 kilos.
Don't! Listen to me...
I'm talking to you.
Please, not that.
Don't do that!
You can diffuse it over a city
or dissolve it in the water.
It's colorless and tasteless.
Does it come from Iraq?
No, the Algerian desert.
France ran experiments down there
until 1975.
"Turn his own weapons
back on the enemy."
Sun Tzu, The Art of War.
Delphine?
You're back? I was about
to take a bath. Do you want a drink?
Coming?
Just a second.
Diane found a plane ticket.
I checked out the date.
June 18 is the day De Gaulle
broadcast from London in 1940.
A symbol of resistance.
June 18, '46.
Proclamation of the Italian Republic.
Democracy beats out fascism.
June 18, '52.
The Soviet UN Ambassador
mentions bacteriological warfare.
One year later, June 18, '53,
General Naguib declares
Egypt a republic.
June 18, '54,
the Security Council
censures apartheid in South Africa.
France abstains.
June 18, '59,
a black uprising in Durban, S. Africa.
June 18, '79,
the SALT II agreement
slowed the arms race
between USSR and USA.
Finally,
June 18, '92, Ireland approves
the Maastricht Treaty by referendum.
Your conclusion?
The hypothesis of al-Bharad
hitting France on June 18
is plausible.
The Beirut-Paris flight symbolizes
North-South tensions, France's errors
and the bacteriological threat
to the West.
And the USB key in the safe?
It links to a website
with a video by al-Bharad.
The translation?
Sir, we received it 45 minutes ago.
Call security.
I, Abu Ghadab,
on this symbolic day of June 18,
shall die a martyr
to show France
we shall never be its slaves.
And I decide
to go to meet Allah today
for there is no other God.
You've got it wrong.
He's been using Islam
for political ends for 20 years.
It's a decoy.
He'd never blow himself up.
But you like being wrong
too much to hear me.
Monday, June 16
Can you see yourself as a martyr?
I'm ready.
It's just I can't face the idea
of killing kids.
I have a son.
His bitch mother
won't let me talk to him.
Anyway, you can't talk to him
from here.
I bought it in Kabul.
I'm not in.
Please, leave a message.
Hi, Ma.
Answer the phone, please.
I know you're there.
I'm a long way away.
Pick up.
I know you can hear me.
I just wanted to say
I'm doing something very important.
I won't be able to call you
for some weeks or even months.
And I wanted to tell you...
I know I wasn't always
how you wanted me to be.
I messed up and everything.
But if you could see me now,
you'd be proud.
I've changed.
I'm fighting for a good cause.
I've changed, Ma.
And I wanted you to know...
I love you.
If only you knew
how much I love you.
They have compromised
the security of the camp.
These cowards
have brought disgrace on Allah.
He who brings disgrace on Allah
does not deserve to live.
It's not mine.
I just called home.
I wanted to talk to my mother.
It's not my phone!
If that's true, prove it.
Kill the traitor.
I'm glad you asked me along.
Won't you tell me
where we're going?
You don't like surprises.
Sure I do.
We're leaving my country
to visit yours.
I'll just freshen up.
Yes.
I'm at the airport. He swapped cases.
It's going to Paris.
It's on Middle East Airways.
I'm on my way.
He's going to blow up the plane.
It won't take off.
Trust me.
Trust you?
Is that all you can find to lie?
Forget it.
Call Lebanese security.
Have them ground the flight
and wait for us.
And get me the seat numbers
for al-Bharad and Boileau.
Mr. and Mrs. Dhorgan?
That's right.
Let's go.
Seats 33H and J.
Search all the luggage.
He duped us.
They're on another flight.
Which one?
How long have you known?
The real question is,
why did your superiors send you,
a beginner,
against a professional like me?
You're gonna blow us up?
The only bomb here, sweetie,
is you!
The phone call you listened in on...
I booked for June 18.
The USB key in my safe...
The air tickets for June 18...
All to deceive your services.
There are no finals in June...
Now they're convinced
I'm going to blow myself up.
Well?
Al-Bharad's flight is about to land
at Paris.
- Is your team ready?
- Yes, sir.
Control to FA 213 from Beirut.
Permission to land, runway 4.
Sure, we'll check all the luggage.
Hold on, she's right here.
Alex for you.
- Listen...
- No, you listen.
There's nothing
on the Middle East flight.
The case you saw must be in Paris.
Diane, are you listening?
Can you hear me?
Did you hear what I said?
It's in Paris.
Diane, answer me.
Can you hear me?
Are you listening?
The case must be in Paris.
It must have been on a flight
via Beirut.
18th of June, 1940 Plaza
Miss, you're not allowed in here.
You have to leave.
Did you hear me?
You must leave.
- C'mon, miss...
- The guy with the backpack.
You can't stay here.
Security to Line 4.
Don't do it.
Don't let them do
what they did to me.
Don't let them wreck your life.
If only you knew...
I've been dead a long time.
Freeze!
Grab him!
The phone! Stop him...
Hold him down!
Don't move.
Fear.
That's the aim.
Destroy you from within
through fear.
Today, I failed.
Tomorrow, others will succeed.
God is generous.
For putting me here today.
- It doesn't make you a fighter.
- You're not.
You're a coward.
A guy who kills civilians,
women and children.
Who drives the weak
to blow themselves up for Islam.
You sully Islam.
When you speak,
you betray Islam and Muslims.
I've heard it 100 times,
my brother.
I'm not your brother.
Don't mix us up.
You're quite right, my brother.
And your wife?
Does she agree with you?
My wife would want me to kill you.
But she'd hate me to be like you.
He's waiting for you.
I won't introduce you.
How did you know the bastard
would use Diane to deceive us?
If she hadn't spotted the bomber,
imagine the tragedy.
You know,
I don't have much imagination.
Case closed.
SECRET OF STATE
If you want anything,
call the chief.
I'm not allowed to talk to you now.
I can't break isolation rules.
Be strong, Aziz.
My name's Pierre.
Your Dad's shitting on you.
He's always lied to you.
He's not in wine,
he works for the secret services.
Tell me where he is, Jeremy.
He's not my father
and my name's not Jeremy.
I recruit in colleges
for the services.
Guys mostly.
So at night,
you were lying, too?
Like you, on the road selling wine.
We're in the same business.
Which one's that?
Tell me where he is
or I'll break your arm.
When did you know I was burned?
You knew, didn't you?
When that guy recognized me,
it was time to get me out.
Rather than protect me, you gambled
with my life and let him fuck me.
So he'd think he was a step ahead.
When will you ever tell the truth?
I'm a patriot, Diane.
If they asked me to tail my mother,
I'd do it.
What happened to you
happens often
when people like you
meet people like me.
- If you were me...
- I'll never be like you.
If you were me...
you'd know you must be able
to do anything for your agent.
Spend hours, days, weeks with him
without going home.
Know his wife, parents,
kids' names and birthdays.
Put your life on hold for him.
The one thing you can't do
is to see him as a human being.
An agent isn't a human,
he's a weapon. Nothing more.
My only consolation
is knowing that you're alone
and you always will be.
I know.
Fouche here.
I got a note about 3 young radicals
about to leave for a camp in Yemen.
Have you got a solution
to infiltrate an agent?
A guy we can trust,
who's solid enough for the job.
Are you there?
Can you hear me?
IN MEMORY OF AGENTS
WHO DIED FOR FRANCE
I asked for a solution.
Have you got a solution or not?
A solution, Alex.
A solution.
Since September 11, 2001,
France's secret services have foiled
over 15 bomb plots
on home territory.
