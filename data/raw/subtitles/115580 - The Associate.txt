You look good. What happened?
- I left the bad company.
Come on let's dance.
I have some good news.
Come on.
Hurry, you give me goosebumps.
- I missed your humor.
Manchester want you back.
Have they found out
that all your good ideas were mine?
He has always respected you. He
wants you as a senior vice president.
You are one of the
highest rated women in the industry.
And your boss, Frank.
- I is also promoted.
Think about it. With Cutty and Manchester
together, we own the Wall Street.
Forget it, dear. Manchester
get neither Cutty or me.
If Manchester does not make it,
then do another there.
Everyone will have his fingers in the Cutty.
You are a zero without him.
You know what, Frank?
I can afford an assassin.
Is that a no?
You can keep the conference in Moscow,
and speak with the grandmother in South America.
Try again.
It was great.
It's point-click commands,
anyone can use it.
- Shall we look at your assets?
- It dares you not!
What you know about along the chain software?
There may be a revolution.
- We know.
- Look at this!
We must meet Robert Cutty personal
about this here. Do they?
He's not so much for the meetings.
I'll do my best.
It's not good NOK.
I want to know when and where.
I call him and find out
of it. So I'll call you.
No, Mr. Cutty is not present.
Just a moment.
Have you read the newspaper?
Have you seen Cindy Mason's article?
Is he really all the affairs?
Looking after he was not the one right?
- Men are like that.
- Did anything happen yesterday?
Not with me. The only people
interested in is the Cutty.
He's a nail in my coffin.
I wish I had never made him...
...a part of my life.
It's as if
I'm not in the Cutty-Ayres.
Let's go two months back.
Two months FC
- F.C.?
- Before Cutty.
You have known too little to do.
Do you have composed it himself?
Before him were the unemployed and poor.
- A small detail.
You call him a genius himself.
He's a bigger hermit than Hughes.
- You let him take credit.
- Because he should be respected.
You've got what you want.
- Thanks.
What secret meeting
with Cutty talking about?
CNN and the Times called. Cindy Mason
offered 1000 $ if she got the address.
She Offered to 1000 $ to
reveal where the meeting would be held?
call and say you agree,
and say the same to the other.
- What should you do?
- Making their way in abundance no.
- Where the hell is Cutty?
- My legs are bad.
Get the camera away from my hair, otherwise
I stick it up your ass!
Thank you.
Hello, dear. How are you?
- I thought the meeting was secret.
- I did too.
- The door is locked.
- Jump out now, Robert.
They're waiting, Robert!
Let him be. - Shame on you, Cindy.
- Can you...
What imagine the Cutty
by cutting us out?
It's too bad!
I'm wasting time.
Someone has talked to the press.
He would not be exposed to them.
If he can not come at a meeting,
how can he run a company?
- Alle Cuttys ideer er her.
- Takk, miss Ayres.
It is certainly exciting, but without
Cutty, I believe that I report pass.
- coat min.
- I have a clear conscience.
I told Robert you were important,
and that some of you were customers.
That we had promised something, that we had
a moral obligation to you.
Wait a minute. Will Cutty...
- He will keep Syntonex themselves.
For any nonsense.
Say to Manchester that you recommended
that Mr. Fallon kept away from it.
I have not said.
- Shut up, Frank.
I do not do it, Donald.
- Pull yourself together.
Look up at page 1.
Let's read it.
Take it easy now.
- "Syntonex economic overview".
- Page 2 is better.
The consolidated financial statements...
Move ya ass, Bissel.
What's wrong?
Trouble in paradise?
- What happened?
- What happened?
They accepted.
I have a surprise.
- Jesus! They accepted.
We have collected a small gift.
I hope Mr. Cutty smokes cigars. Si
thanks for that, he saved our jobs.
This is my favorite time of year.
Dad gave me a train ticket in the Christmas present.
One-way?
He bought one for us each,
and then we drove to the train.
One year we ended up in Cleveland,
that he had to resemble a fairytale.
Do you still?
- No, now I'm a light teeth every July
It was a great story.
- Orcs you another one?
- Sure.
Robert Cutty does not exist.
- He's not fair.
- I have known for weeks.
What do you mean by "weeks"?
Hans ideer lå der, og du fikk dem.
- Why did not you say something?
- When I got no more fine gifts!
If you had to find a white man
to get people to recognize you,...
- it is my duty to keep life
in the illusion and support you.
Think that you have not said a word.
You are something for yourself.
Thanks.
When I assume Syntonex need
I assistant. Interested?
Really?
- Does that mean yes?
It's a nice little dance.
Great headline.
Under the low point.
- The Cutty should get out of the cage.
- It is certainly one that can help us.
I have a friend in the Finance Authority.
- I put Eddie on Laurel.
- Inkognito.
- Great.
Agent Thompkins?
Frank Peterson here.
You should hear what Cindy Mason
've written before the newspaper comes out.

I'm going.
You did me in a good mood so
that I had to go and act.
I bought something for you.
Merry Christmas.

Management Thomkins? Good day,
I'm Laurel Ayres. Can I help?
I want to speak with Mr. Cutty.
- Just like the rest of the world.
He is not here,
but I will say that they have been here.
Were not they together with Aesop Franklin
on Donald Fallon party?
- Jo. Is it forbidden?
- Mr Cutty probably an explanation.
Give him this.
A subpoena? Should he witness
because I'm in the newspaper with Franklin?
He served on Syntonex shares.
- He did not do anything illegal.
There we find out when we meet.
Working together, he does not...
...we need to do a
full investigation. Merry Christmas.
This is totally insane.
- Charlie are my only hope.
Tell the truth.
- Are you crazy? It is fraud.
If I had just finished Syntonex-
act, so I could drop the Cutty.
- Including Santa Claus for us?
Hold-up now. I've NOK in the head.
I think he's following us.
This is insane.
- Out the door. This here.
Hello, ladies.
- What is it now?
- A new look.
That sounds wonderful out.
It should be distinguished,
rich, full power and man.
This is interesting.
- White.
He must be white.
- Shit!
- This is crazy.
- Do you have a better idea?
- Charlie can do miracles.
- I could use one.
Take monster on and empty
breasts for sand. I'll be right back.
I hope
that I'm getting so old.
My name is Robert Cutty.

I'm talking right down from the uterus.
- Act more masculine.
All right.
I'm Bob Cutty. I bite you
in the balls in the back seat of my car.
I said, masculine,
not morbid.
Can I trick the Finance Authority now?
- It is a miracle.
I never go on stage with a new
look before I've tried it.
Tried it?
Mr Cutty. Of course. He can
get the best without reservation.
Discretion?
The Plaza hotel.
- What about Cutty?
- He will meet Finance Authority.

He's here.

a meeting with him and end the act.
Miss Ayres said that all costs
was at her expense.

I do not say good night,
because I know they come to heaven.
Hey, Robert.
It's me, Camille.
Camille...
- What have you come in?
- I bribed a boy.
- What do you want?
- You were eager to meet me.
Are you disappointed?
- There must be.
Not at all. You are so lovely.
- You are a genius. Geniuses are delicious.
- Do you think that I am a genius?
I knew it
when I saw Banff prospect.
But Syntonex prospect made me
to be silent. It was so insightful.
The letters are all women's dream.
- I know.
Have a seat.
- Robert...
- keep his pants on.
Camille. Oh, dear.
It's La Perla underwear.
- You are a man of the world.
I want your genius.
Fill me with your genius.
What's wrong? "
" I have cramps.
I'll help you.
Stop it!
Is not that what you want?
No. It should be a pretty and intelligent
woman that you feel too good.
Would you not make a career?
Use your head.
There is no one has said before.
- What a surprise.
I trembled. Keep around me.
- You can do yourself.
It's not down here
that is important. It is up here.
Think about it.
And get your clothes on.
I'm glad
you would see me.
What a man.
I want to pay you,
but tell me where Mr. Cutty live?
- Is he alone?
- I can unfortunately not tell.
- What number does he live on?
- Do not ask about such things.
Mr Cutty?
It's confidential...
Oh, God...
men's room
Excuse me, Mr. Cutty...
I'm Frank Peterson from
Manchester Investment Company.
Walter Manchester and I eat
along with Donald Fallon tonight.
I gotta go.

Come to my car.
- Solo They already?
- Idiot! Cutty escape!
- Mr Cutty car!
Do you see him?
Robert Cutty? Donald Fallon.
Right from the ashes of the fire.
Taxi!
The press treats you
like a rock star. A cigar?
I was on my way to a business
noon where you were the main topic.
I met Peterson in the toilet.
- Can we talk man to man?
- Man to man. It suits me.
- HP lets not Syntonex.
With you at the helm, it is understandable.
- Syntonex is Laurels children.
If she wants a child,
she must find a husband.
Are you poor? "
" I have bad taste in the mouth.
- Is it from Cuba?
- No, from the Dominican Republic.
The shit I do not smoke.
- I apologize for it.
- Imagine that you would give me something like that.
- Frank has prepared a proposal.
Take Laurel to work,
then accept the one confession.
She gets a lesson and a conditional
dom. Authorization her blows.
- You are free.
- It was a great deal.
She gets a little money, and we win.
- Run to the side.
It's okay
if you do not like the agreement.
Get Finance Authority to drop the case,
so we forget the rest.
Nice to meet you.
- Syntonex need you.
Think about it.
Next time you get one from Cuba.
Shit
that he reminded me of Brando.
What do you do, Mr. Cutty?
Follow him.
Inn on the page. Stop.
Turn off the engine.
We are here for a while.
Good, Cutty. You will die.
You should... die.
It's absolutely crazy.
- Laurel went in, but did not come out.
I was at closing time.
- Cutty arrived at Plaza...
...went to Laurel,
and never came out again.
I was there all night.
Laurel closed not up this morning.
What is it?
- What is it?
- Nothing.
They knew they were shadowed,
and relax from you.
We should look after ourselves.
- Merry Christmas.
- I love you, you bastard.
Even when I'm the perfect man,
he sticks the knife in his back on me.
Do you want to talk about it?
- No! I want to kill him.
You got a problem. How will you
kill one that does not exist?
He can not meet
Finance Authority if he is dead.
This is the best gift
you have given me.
It's great.
...the wreck of the boat was found at
Albania. All are presumed dead.
Oh, my God...
- What?
Mr Cutty was with the boat.
- Stop...
- Hallo... He was on board.
- Cutty and ship owner were friends!
Now he's dead.
- Oh! It's perfect.
Do you have a black dress?
So bring it on you!
He was the sweetest and
kindest man I have met.
He was the best thing that has happened to me.
I am completely devastated over...
...that he is finished as fish food,
and that his body never being found.
They've rescued all on board.
Mr Cutty was not.
It's a miracle!
Did you see an inscription in it?
"Dear Robert, lets continue".
Who is Jane?
- A, he failed in his quest.
Now the power on.
- Mr Cutty missing a foot.
This is more realistic.
- Should we not take out the hook?
Just do it.
- What?
- He moved.
Is not this wrong of us?
- Hook?
It's drastic to kill him.
- Not worse than to create him.
I've found it.
- Just throw it in there.
- Should I loosen the handbrake?
- Do it.
That's...
Goodbye, Mr. Cutty.
I'll miss him.
It exploded not.
- What do we do now?
- I do not know.
Let's not let it stand for?
- How will we explain it?
We can not go down there.
It only takes a break.
cars explode,
or so they do not.
Votes not it?
Are you okay?
- Yes, it is now.
Well, we do not live by it.
- That you can say.
We'll handle together and driving home.

Excuse me, Miss Mason.
Excuse me, ladies.
I have unfortunately just found out
that Robert Cutty not participate in the evening.
There's typhoon in Hong Kong and the plane
of his were not allowed to light.
Bob is very disappointed.
He asked me to apologize and said,
many thanks for the welcome to the club.
And thanks for the price.
On behalf of my friend, Robert Cutty,
I accept it on...
Mr Cutty is here.
- No, he is not.
I thank the...
- Cutty is here.
- It is not true.
- This release can not escape.
- Want a bet?
- You continue to smoke cheap cigars.
- Nice to see you.
Just be, Frank.
Without you I was not here tonight.
Gentlemen. I rented a Concorde
typhoon struck and the finish line.
There is some good to be
interested in an exclusive club,...
it makes one feel good.
You know me not, but accepted the
me as one of their own. Amazing.
My work spoke for itself
himself, and I am "This year's business man. "
But to quote Gaucho Marx:
"I will not belong to a club
who wants me as a member. "
We should encourage the
young people, therefore
I share the prize with this young man.
He has been a source of inspiration.
Oh, God!
- Now I understand.
You know what, gentlemen?
There's something about the exclusivity.
The word exclusive,
means "to exclude".
That's it
that would happen to me.
I accepted the rules of the game.
I worked hard and honestly.
But I knew that I had
the right image for this club -
and that I would never get it.
An image is something funny.
Under the right imagen
it may be one who is wrong.
And the one who is wrong...
...we have the right Robert Cutty.
It could be him serving
coffee or light his cigar.
A boy or waiter.
You never know.
I want to wish you the happiness
getting me into the club...
...that the first woman ever.
Thank you.
Well done, Laurel.
We have lunch next week.
- You were fantastic, Laurel.
- We did it.
I thought that one should be
mischievous in the business world...
Men always hurt them
they love most.
I have examined my soul.
I feel reborn. Liberated.
I have come in contact
with my feminine side.
I am ready to change my
the caring...
...compassionate leader
you need in the company.
Can I prove it?
This is fantastic.
Unbelievable that people can change.
I know my partner NOK
to know...
...that she will be kjempesur.
