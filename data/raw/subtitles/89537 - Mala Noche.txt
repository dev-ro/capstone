Working in the store Sunday all day.
(Man]
Can I help you?
(Narrator] I want to drink this Mexican boy,
Johnny Alonzo, from L.A. near Riverside.
He makes my heart throb...
# Thumpety, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum #
when I see him.
He says he's 1 8,
but he could be 1 6.
Do you want some chips?
(Narrator] All I want to do is caress him.
I want to hold him.
- What's that?
- He has these hickeys on his neck.
- What have you got there?
- He likes men.
What's that?
That looks like a hickey.
Gonna be your friend.
Su amigo.
(Narrator] He's out on the street
with friends staying in a three-dollar-a-night...
cheap hotel room on Sixth off skid road.
- And he speaks almost no English.
- Hey, tell him I'm not the Immigration.
Como se llama?
Me llamoJohnny Alonzo.
(Man]
And you don't have any place to stay, do you?
Look here, man.
Let me have a pack ofTop, will ya?
That's all I wanna hear.
- There you go, huh?
- All right. Thanks a lot.
Thanks.
Hey, Johnny.
Hola.
Que pasa?
Es muy fr/o.
(Speaking Spanish)
Come here, you little cutie.
You need a place to stay tonight?
I mean, there's always my place.
Okay?
And it's right across from
the Y.W.C.A. over there.
Hey. Wait a minute. Come back.
No way.
I'm in love with this boy.
- Really.
- You are always in love.
No. I mean, Sarah,
he just came into the store.
I mean, I'm sure he just got into town.
You see people
come into the store all the time.
Let me invite him to dinner.
Okay.
So where are we gonna fnd him?
- I don't know.
- Hmm.
The street.
How old is he?
- He says he's 1 8, but...
- Oh.
I don't know. He's probably...
Vegetables and rice.
Sounds good.
- ##(Speakers. ; Woman Singing In Spanish]
- (Coin Rattles]
I don't care. Even...
Even if it jeopardizes
working at the store...
I have to show him that...
that I'm gay for him.
I have to show him how I feel.
What are you doing out here
by yourself, honey?
Oh, I... I'm waiting for
some friends of mine, actually.
- Oh, okay. You're all right?
- Yeah, I'm fne. Thanks.

Hello. Hola.
You ran out without paying?
Are they looking for you now?
Are they after you?
Um, we're gonna be
leaving pretty soon actually.
- I'm sorry. I didn't know you're... Are you married?
- Well, no. It's a... It's some friends of mine.
You know, usually people cook,
you know, they're married.
- It's kind of dumb.
- No. Um, you're gonna get hit, you know.
Oh, God. I've been hit before, you know.
Hey. What are you doing under my car?
johnny.
No, we'd like to invite you over...
Excuse me.
We'd like to invite you for dinner.
We're gonna make you some good food.
- We're hoping to cook him for dinner tonight.
- You're gonna cook him for dinner?
Gonna make something
for them to eat actually.
 Tienes hambre?
Are you hungry?
- (Car Tires Squeal]
- Come on.
Sure. Sure. Come on.
- Take care, okay?
- Okay. You too, lady.
- Be careful.
- Bye-bye.
; Guau!
Hey. Hey. What are you doing?
I am gonna be making you some good food.
Where'd you get this stuff at?
- No, no. I'm gonna be cooking some vegetables.
- Listen to her.
All right. All right. He is a sugar freak.
Permiso?

(Johnny]
Si.
(Chattering)
It's okay. Sure. We can go back.
It's all right. Don't freak out.
- What's the matter?
- He wants to go back to the hotel.
It's okay. S/. Es posible.
Okay. I'll take him back. Then we'll...
Si. Es posible.

(Chatter On Police Radio]
- (Sarah] What'd he say?
- (Spanish)
Well, he says that when, um,
they frst came on the train...
they had another friend
with them, and...
and the police came...
Tres policia?
S/. There were, like, three police.
jumped him, and they...
They hurt their friend.
Killed him?
- That's horrible.
- I think he, like, killed him.
- What's this...
- The biggest pro...
The biggest problem is you get too
far removed from the death aspect.
It's like you walk into McDonald's,
and they just line the cows up...
and they bump 'em all off for you
and you never have to see it happening.
If you had to go out there
and kill every piece of meat that you ate...
that's a... that's a little easier for me to buy,
you know, because you experience the death.
You see it happening, and you realize
what you're doing when you eat it.
But when you walk into a McDonald's
and say, "Uh, give me a Big Mac"...
you know, you're just getting dead cow
and you never see the cow die.
- That's...
- (Sarah] All those poisons release
at the time of death too.
(Man]
Bad for your karma.
So it's not bad to eat food without meat
in it. You know. You can survive.
##(Ballad. ; Men Singing In Spanish]

- (Sarah] Nice meeting you.
- Adios.

(Narrating] We returned downhill
through the tunnel curves fast.
Jesus Christ. The boy's insane, like
all Mexicans, about driving fast and crazy.
In the front seat next to him I cover my eyes,
tell him to slow down.
It's too late to get control
of the wheel.
The look on his face is pure ecstasy.
The incredible, beautiful, turned-on face
of an ignorant Mexican teenager.
His friends laughing in the backseat...
driving a maniacal machine
downhill as fast as he can go.
(Thunder Rumbling]
I'll give you $1 5 if I can sleep with Johnny.
Quince dolares.
Si? Para me and Johnny.
Is okay? Bien?
Quince dolares. I wish I had more.
I wish I had a hundred.
I love you.
Come on.
Ask him.
Mm-mmm.
I'd give you 50 if I had it,
but I only have 1 5.
Quince dolares para tu.
Fifteen dollars?
(Rain Pattering]
Come on. Angel face.
- I want to sleep with him.
- Okay, vamos.

Where the hell do you think you're goin'?

No, we're not visitors.
Uh, I'm with him. We're going upstairs.
Got a key?
- The key.
- (Spanish)
- Doesn't have it.
- No visitors.
- Oh, come on. We're going upstairs.
- You're not going anywhere.

- No, you're not going anywhere. Open the door.

Is that when he slips the $ 1 0 bill
from my pants, or did I lose it?
I think he got it.
##(Ballad. ; Woman Singing In Spanish]
(Narrator] They need money...
Johnny and him. I hope they got it.
Though I was upset that I'd been fucked,
violated and lost the money too...
for a few moments,
thinking about it, in the morning...
of the Mexicans gloating over having fucked
the gringo puto and got his money too...
talking about it and laughing,
my ass sore.
And the more I think about it,
the more I know I asked for a reckless evening.
##(Continues]
(Narrator] Johnny'll probably never
look at me or talk to me as a friend.
He probably wouldn't have in the fiirst place.
I had to fiind out...
to get as close to him as I could...
even if it turned into a shit-bad night.
(Woman)
Hey, buddy, how's it going?
- All right. What can I get ya?
- Oh, we need a ffth of Night Train.
- Fifth of Night Train.
- Yeah.
(Narrator] He said he was gonna
return to L.A. in 1 5 days...
as soon as he got
traveling money together.
He lives with nine or 1 0 brothers.
Maybe when they're making love they can
think about Roberto having fucked me.
Roberto's cock fucks Johnny fucked me.
That's about as close toJohnny
as I'll ever get.
Unless I had the money.
Poor boys never win.
Who fucks whom?
Mala noche.
Every street Mexican on Sixth
will think he can stick it in me.
Well, they're wrong. But they never were
too smart to begin with, or they wouldn't be here.
Chingalo. My ass is sore.
It's true. L... I think he tried to use his cock
like a weapon on me, macho fucking prick.
##(Continues]
Johnny comes into the store often.
An acquaintance of mine brought a camera
into the store the other day...
and I gave him $ 1 0 for it.
We decided to go out
and see if it worked.
It does! (Laughs]
Hey!
Pepper talks to a dog we fiind on the street...
and I say, "You lead a dog's life. "
I don't think he understands.
Johnny doesn't want...
doesn't want to be in our movie...
and tells me Ro... Roberto wants to
learn to drive the car.
- Tell me.
- Randy. Is that your name?
- No, no. My name's Walt.

"A circuit court jury in Portland unanimously
convicted 22-year-old Armando...
'Zamora Flores, a transient,
of murder and fiirst-degree robbery...
in the slaying
of William Somerset, 53."

- Hey, hey, hey.
Look. "Flores, through

they were going to another tavern...
but went instead to Somerset's house."
- Hey, hey. (Spanish)
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
"He said there a man made
homosexual advances towards him...
"and when he refused,
came at him with a knife.
They struggled, and Flores said
he stabbed Somerset."
Friend of yours?
You see how sad that is?
Nope.
- Vamonos.
- You any...
Great. You got a gun, huh?
You can't just carry it around like that.
What are you trying to prove?
You're gonna shoot your balls off.
What if... What are you gonna do if somebody
pulls a gun on you and you have to use it?
Look. Don't point that thing.
It's not a toy.
Take it out ofhere.
Man.
Get it out of the store.
You're just gonna get in trouble.
Take the pie. Vamoose.
Take it and go.

a privileged life...
and just because
I see someone attractive likeJohnny...
doesn't mean I should be able to have him...
to buy him or whatever, just because
he's hungry and on the street...
desperate, good-looking.
That wasn't my intention exactly,
but it could be misunderstood that way.

(Walt Narrating]
The plan is simple.
I go to his room at midnight.
(Knocking]
He opens the door,
sees that I want him that badlly...
I lay down at his feet like a dog.
Or rather, at the feet
of Roberto and him and...
(Howling)
(Howling)
And after an hour or so, when none of us knows
what to do any longer, I get up and I leave.
My point is being made,
that I want to see him badlly, right?
That must mean something.
How many gringos...
have acted that dramatically
toward him ever?
And whether or not he could respond
in any meaningful way doesn't matter.
He would think of it
as a dramatic macho act.

That's what people pay in the store for it.
But it's worthless

Butter. Margarine.
It's not margarine.
It's shit.
And Pepper has girlfriends too.
I don't think he likes me that much.
I don't blame him.
We're just not compatible.
But why isn't it easy for them?
I mean...
they don't have any imagination
about sex or anything else...
like fantasies or erotic friendship.
Friendship?
I guess it's not their fault.
- Let me in. Let me in.
- (Knocking)
- (Man] Who is it?
- It's me, Polly. Let me in.
- What do you want now?
- There's a guy... There's a weird guy upstairs.
H-He followed me in.
Wh-What kind of... Did you look?
There is a guy who makes Son of Sam
look like Tweety Bird.
We've gotta call the cops.
He's a derelict, man.
We gotta call the cops.
All right, I'll call the cops.
But, look, you handle it.
- Okay. I will.
- You talk to 'em.
- I don't want anything to do with this.
- All right, all right.
Hey! Let me in.
Wait a minute.

They're people like we are.
I found out they call him Papas, not Pepper,
because he likes to eat papas... french fries.
El Loco Papas is smart like a fox,
staying offby himself...
but they got him anyway.
This kid shouldn't be out on the street, man.
They get into trouble that way, man.
Dealing marijuana... The cops
are gonna get him, man. You know that.
jesus Christ.
It ain't fair, but...
(No Audible Dialogue)
(Muttering)
Hello, everybody, goddamn it.
(Laughs)
Senor.
Amigo... Mexico.
(Walt] I'm gonna have to boot your ass
out ofhere pretty soon if you don't mellow out.
(Mutters]
Go ahead. Make me go...
Watch out.
- Sorry.
- All right.
- Love a...
- Love a duck.
You see?
So, what I told him was the story about
the lady with one in her bedside stand.
I said, "What the fuck is that?"
And she said, "That's for burglars."
And I said, "You will not
blow a burglar away with that.
You'll blow him into little pieces."
And she said,
"That's what it's for, George."

Looking forJohnny, I saw no sign.
I think they got you too.
You have no place to go or to hide.
I don't know
what's gonna happen to you.
Or, I do know what's gonna happen to you,
and so do you, probably.
And that's why I fell in love with Johnny
in the fiirst place.
And that's why Roberto was silent most of the time
and chased white butt...
if you know what I mean...
hoping some of that sticky good comfort,
luck and security might rub off on him.
Or at least he could make it squeal.
(Engine Starts, Revs)
Are you all right?
Hey!
Are you all right?
Man, don't be afraid.
I'm your friend.
(Man] Hey, assholes! Shut the fuck up!
I'm tryin'to get some sleep!
Give me a break!
I gotta work for a living, huh?
- Damn!
- Johnny!
Hey! Johnny!
(Laughing)
Hey! What happened to you?
They didn't get you.
Were you in Idaho?
(Whispers)
Shit!
So, come on.
Tell me what happened.
(Johnny Speaking Spanish]
(Walt Narrating] All this time
we think Johnny's on vacation in Idaho.
Well, it seems that Immigration picked him up
and shipped him back to the border...
not to Idaho.
Swimming the Rio Grande by moonlight,
he's back in less than two weeks.
He rode the rails,
hopped the freights.
(Laughing)
; Toro! I; Toro, muchacho!
; Ole! I; Ole!
; Toro! I; Toro!
Whoa!
(Train Passing]
The police came.
I told you to get rid of that gun.
(Laughs)

##(Continues, Man Singing In Spanish]
Hey, how you doing?
Good to see you.
Hey!

(Sarah] I'm thinking ofleaving
for Anchorage tomorrow.
What's in Anchorage?
I can do nude dancing
in just about any bar in town...
and make 1 50 bucks a night.
Why do you wanna do... Look!
(Walt]
I can't believe he's there.
Hey, hey! What are you doing?
Hey, come down to the store
and see me sometime. All right?
Come... Come down to the store
and talk to me. All right?
