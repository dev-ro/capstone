Wakey-wakey. Heads up.
Shoes, pants... low bridge... shirt.
On your left. I'll take that.
Block, slap.
Knife switch.
Grip him, flip him.
Okay. Coffee anyone?
Can you imagine waking up every day
with some random asshole
like Mr. Good Morning here
trying to hack you up
with a fucking machete?
Seriously.
This might have been fun for a while.
Fucking dead!
Once the shock wore off, once I realized
what the hell was happening,
after nearly 140 times,
it just fucking got annoying.
It's like being stuck in a video game
in a level you can't beat.
And I wish it would stop,
but I know it won't.
You know how people say,
"Oh, I can do that with my eyes closed,"
and you always think
they sound like assholes, but whatever.
Watch.
Sorry, pal, they think you're me!
As many times as I've seen
this happen to my apartment,
I still can't help but think,
"Fuck, man, this is a lease."
The landlord is already
an asshole, anyway, and...
I'm never, ever getting
my security deposit back.
Wasn't always like this.
I was happy once.
I really was.
I had a woman that I loved, but...
...now I'm just pissed off.
Ah, shit, got to jump.
I missed this truck
exactly 22 times before.
You know how it feels,
falling four stories to the street below?
It fucking hurts is how it feels.
Mr. Man's Man in the Challenger here
screams at date-rape volume
every single time.
I'm being carjacked!
Yes, you are.
The next set of assholes
trying to kill me are in that minivan.
Could you get through
this traffic, please?
Don't tell me how to drive.
I'm not telling you how to drive.
Esmeralda the Chauffeur and Pam.
- You love to argue.
- Now, I have no fucking idea
if those are their real names
because I never stop to say hello.
Now, after the bus,
it's pretty much smooth sailing
and I can... Wait a second, did I...
Oh, shit, did-did I get to the bus yet?
Nope.
Sweet Jesus!
God?
Don't feel bad for me.
This kind of shit happens every day.
I used to complain that
every day felt the same,
and then May 9th came,
and now every day is the same.
Same wake-up scream,
same machete-wielding asshole.
Same everything, with slight variations.
Mother...!
One thing that never changes...
...is I die, every single day.
I die.
Here's a little highlight reel.
Now, truth be told,
I don't even know why they want
to kill me or what I've done
to deserve getting killed.
But there's a shit-ton of 'em.
You've met Pam.
She did that to me 14 times
before I finally got her timing down.
This little angel-faced asshole
is known as Guan Yin.
How do I know her name?
I am Guan Yin.
And Guan Yin has done this.
Her name means "Goddess of Mercy."
I think she digs irony.
I call this little
cocky motherfucker Kaboom.
What's up, pretty boy?
You fucking weirdo dwarf,
what are you doing?
Oh, I don't like that attitude.
I've given them all nicknames:
Pam, Smiley, the German twins,
Roy Number 2,
who just happens to be some asshole
who looks exactly like me.
Sometimes I manage to kill them.
But it doesn't matter.
They always find me,
and eventually they take me out.
I'm Guan Yin.
And Guan Yin has done this.
I don't know how this is possible
or why I keep repeating the same day.
I've never had time to figure it out.
It's a shit show from
the second I open my eyes.
Jemma... the only woman I've ever loved
and the one person who has
the answers I'm looking for.
Hello.
Uh, I-I'm looking for Dr. Jemma Wells.
Who's this?
This is, uh, her hus...
um, her boyfriend, Roy.
Ah, Captain Roy Pulver,
he of Delta Force fame.
Who's this?
This is Colonel Clive Ventor.
- Jemma's boss.
- Until recently.
Is she around?
Well, no, unfortunately she's not.
Oh, do you know when she'll be back?
Now, that is more of a cosmic question
that I'd have to hand over
to a higher power.
Huh?
She's dead.
- What?
- Hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but Miss Wells took a nasty spill
and snapped her neck last night.
An accident in the lab,
working late, likely very fatigued.
No.
Can I ask where you are?
That was no fucking accident.
- Eins.
- Zwei.
Drei.
Why is she dead? Who killed her?
I've never lived long enough to find out.
Okay, so, where were we?
Fuck!
Oh, honey, we got ourselves a cowboy.
I think I'm gonna
have to get serious here.
What the fuck?
Fuck me!
Oh! Fuck.
Nah, I think they deserved it.
So, I could run for a while
and I could hide for a while,
but the day always ends bad
in a hail of bullets.
So I figure, if I'm gonna get fucked up,
I should probably get fucked up.
- Hey, Roy.
- Hey, Jake.
You look like death taking a dump.
- What happened to you?
- I just woke up wrong.
- I'm fine, Jake.
- All right.
Happens all the time.
Can I get a large bottle
of that baijiu, please?
You know what, Jake?
- Make it two large bottles.
- Two! Jesus Christ.
Hear ye, hear ye!
Sir Osis of Liver!
I'm just kidding.
Alcoholics Unanimous, am I right?
We only got today, right, Jake?
'Cause tomorrow isn't guaranteed.
Fucking "A," pal.
Fucking "A."
This kid is all about the shutdown.
How can you drink like that?
How can you not?
You know, a lot of expert
internal security pundits...
and mind you, I'm one of 'em...
think that next 9/11
will target our distilled spirits.
Now, you have got a country
where the rate of alcoholism
and binge drinking is somewhere
in the 38th percentile.
So should you wipe out, en masse...
This douchebag is named Dave.
Dave is a security specialist
with some private firm,
and it doesn't matter
what my answer is to him
asking, "How can you drink like that?"
He always launches into
this exact same fucking speech.
I know what he's gonna say, word for word.
I know everything that's gonna happen
from the second I walk in.
At 11:05, this famous
Chinese swordfighter comes in.
She was a 12-time world champion.
Holy shit! Dai Feng.
Roy, you know she's one of
the most famous...
- Wudang Chinese sword masters?
- 12-time...
- World champion.
- Have I told you about her?
- A hundred times.
- Really?
- I don't remember.
- I do.
Pedro, clear a table for Sifu Feng.
Hi. Please, sit.
Sifu Feng here is
the reason I have to bust my ass
to get to the bar every day.
If I get here any later than 11:00,
she takes the last seat at the bar.
Oh, shit.
She just stared at me.
Have you ever been with a woman?
I think I'm catching a fish,
if you know what I mean.
I think you have a better chance of
growing a penis on your forehead, Jake.
At around noon...
O-Okay. I feel, I feel a little bit bad
about this next thing.
I just love seeing him wipe out.
I'm sorry.
I know I should probably warn him,
but it's just so fucking funny,
and it's not like I got
a lot to laugh about these days.
You can't file workman's comp, Pedro.
No one will believe you.
At 12:20, Dave the pantload
finally goes back to work.
You better hope the terrorists
don't decide to start poisoning
the world's baijiu supply, Roy.
But not before delivering
that little gut-buster.
- It's too much.
- Sit down, Dave.
Excuse me?
I want to tell you a story.
Whoa. Okay, I'm bombed today.
A little twist on the war story.
I start talking about
the other times I've died
when I've had too much to drink.
You ever been shot in the face, Dave?
Huh?
I was shot in the face.
A funny thing happened to me
right before I died.
This was a while back now. I...
I think it was a .45 ACP round.
Enters here, clean.
Bullet winds up in my mouth,
almost intact,
and I remember tasting steak.
Yeah.
Like a really, really good rib eye.
Mmm.
And it wasn't only until,
until much later,
when I was alive again, I said, "Shit.
That was my tongue being cooked
by the heat of the bullet."
That's what I tasted.
My tongue.
You believe that shit?
That's fucking wild.
That is a true story, Dave.
Good stuff, buddy.
Ever thought about getting a sober coach?
Copy that.
At exactly 12:47...
Oh, l-let me get to that in a second.
But say a quarter till,
I've usually got
a really, really good buzz,
and I-I'm feeling fucking good.
You see, as long as I make it to this bar,
I can drink until they find me.
I can get absolutely shit-faced...
...and not feel a thing.
12:47 p. m.... I've never, not once,
made it a minute past this point.
Why do I let it happen?
Why not?
'Cause outside of this bar,
no matter what direction I run
and no matter how hard I fight,
I have never lived past 12:47 p. m.
They always get me.
Bunch of assholes I've never met,
killing me for reasons
that remain a mystery.
And she's dead... my girl.
Gone in a moment further back
than I can ever go.
Stuck here in the death loop
of a never-ending day.
I know I can't keep
drinking my way through it.
Not when every day ends like this.
I need a plan now.
I need to make somebody pay.
They have an army.
All I have is time.
Yesterday was months ago.
Great.
Yeah, that's good.
Guys, um, can you give me
a second, please?
Sure.
My God, woman.
Look at you.
- Hi.
- Hey.
So, have you developed
some allergic reaction to the phones?
No, no, I just got back,
my cell phone was shut off,
and I didn't get a chance
to square away my landline, so...
- So they shut that off, too?
- Eh, yeah.
I mean, it's-it's really just luck
that you got in touch with me at all.
Oh, yeah. Luck, yeah.
The amount of luck
it took to find you in the bar
at the bottom of your apartment building.
I mean, what were the odds?
Well, hello there, sarcasm.
How you been, stranger?
Haven't heard from you in a while.
What's that?
I brought a résumé.
But the printer I used
was kind of low on ink
so the Delta Force section
is hard to read.
Sh...
- Is that gonna hurt my chances?
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Come here.
- Hmm?
They, uh, wear uniforms here, so just...
Oh. All right, cool, yeah.
- I need to just...
- I mean, it's not those...
whoa... those maroon things,
like mall security
'cause I can't rock that look.
Maroon. Like... my dress?
No, not like your dress,
because that would be sexy.
- That's...
- No, I'm just saying.
- ...fine.
- Anyway, I...
What's the salary here, anyway?
You have any idea?
And is there a medical co-pay
because I have preexisting,
you know, with the combat stuff.
Anyway, what do you do here?
It looks really big.
- Been working on it a while?
- Just long enough,
I hope.
What is that thing, anyway?
That's five years' worth
of sleepless nights
and round-the-clock research.
And it means more to me
than you can possibly imagine.
- What does it do?
- What's it do?
Hmm.
Unmakes all of time and space
and destroys the planet in its entirety,
if improperly used.
No shit?
Wait, like "doomsday" destroy?
Well, you must be really stressed.
Mm-hmm.
Wow, look at Joe.
Jesus, he's getting so big, Jemma.
Hey, you mind if I swap this out?
- Huh?
- This-this picture.
You-you got another one of these?
Oh, yeah, sure, you can take it.
What's your weight?
Uh...
I'm doing, uh, I'm doing
a special paleo thing,
so it's like 175.
Still drinking?
- Yeah.
- I'll put 180.
Have you thought about telling him?
It would mean a lot to me
if we could tell him, Jemma.
Honestly, what would he gain?
You've been absent m-most of his life.
Why do you got to say it like that?
Like it wouldn't be worth it
if I got to know him now, you know.
My work took me away from you guys.
- Your work?
- Yeah.
Your work? I...
You loved that life
a lot more than you loved
the idea of sharing one with us.
Getting shot at is way more exciting
- than diapers and minivans.
- Right, right, right.
There's your go-to argument
and you know that.
I'm just the asshole who didn't
want to stick around, right?
What does it matter anymore, Roy?
We-we both moved on,
we've made our decision,
and Joe adores you, anyway.
- He adores me?
- Yeah.
What'd he say about me?
What do you want, Roy?
I lost you, okay?
I know that. I blew it.
I made my peace with it.
Please don't let that happen with my son.
That's all I'm asking.
He's our boy, Jemma.
- Dr. Wells.
- Just a minute.
Oh, sorry, Brett.
Uh, this is Roy. Roy, Brett.
Brett's head of security here at Dynow.
Your office is in
a restricted area, Dr. Wells,
and is therefore off-limits.
I made it clear to the colonel
that I would accept visitors
when I deemed it appropriate.
I was just dropping off
my résumé, big guy.
It's all good.
Well, we're not hiring right now...
Captain Pulver.
Tell him I'll be there in a moment.
Colonel's waiting.
What a dick.
I thought you said you were hiring.
They are. We are.
I am.
What are you talking about?
It's a very specific security detail.
Black bag stuff? Like covert?
- Beyond.
- Really?
When do I start?
Sooner than you think.
I read the man's résumé,
and I see cause for concern.
He doesn't look like much.
No one ever notices the housefly
till he fucks up
a good bowl of soup, Brett.
There's something I don't like about him.
He has that... trait.
What trait is that?
The overachiever who makes up for
a lack of talent with hustle.
The guy on the playground
I grew up hating.
Vet his service history.
If it's accurate, I want him
tracked and monitored.
If he becomes problematic,
we'll deal with him.
And, uh, reach outside the normal ranks.
No one that could connect back to us.
The more random the asset, the better.
Find some real freaks.
Okay, I'm-a get out of here,
grab a little vino, maybe some...
- Just let me fix your hair.
- Ow, ow, Jemma!
I'm bleeding.
Did you get my birthday present, Roy?
What are you doing here?
You're acting so weird.
Did you get it? The present.
I sent it to you.
I don't know. I haven't checked.
Well, please do. I sent it a few days ago.
I will. Of course I will.
Dr. Wells, could I see you for a moment?
I'll go to the hospital first.
Be there in a moment, Colonel.
- You drew blood.
- Listen to me now, Roy.
Okay, look, I know we haven't
seen much of each other lately,
and I know we've gone down
very different paths.
- I know, but what I was thinking...
- It's important that you listen.
- Just listen.
- Okay.
All right, you talk, you talk, you talk.
Okay. I've forgotten
how trying this can be.
Okay.
I see a lot of you in Joe. I do.
His determination,
his willingness to succeed no matter what.
- He has some of your best qualities.
- Nice.
But he also has your selfishness
and your ability to just disappear
when it suits...
Just when I thought
we were turning a corner.
- ...and run from responsibility.
- Okay, all right.
What do you want from me?
Just tell me. Just tell me.
I want the man I fell in love with
a long time ago,
the one who gave me a son.
The strong, confident version of you,
not the Roy who's out every night
getting hammered and...
Remember this. Osiris.
- Osiris.
- Okay.
Whoa.
Look, it's Roid and Rage.
You know, carbohydrates
are not your friend, fellas.
Dr. Wells, are you well?
Yes.
- Does cigar smoke bother you?
- No, not at all.
The Spindle.
Well, we're experiencing
a minor delay at the moment.
And why?
R and D is never an exact science.
And yet that's exactly
what we're after, exact science.
Your, uh, friend, Captain Pulver.
Yes, he dropped off a résumé.
And whatever possessed him?
Well, I may have mentioned in passing
the military presence here at the lab.
And whatever possessed you?
The security protocols of this facility
should not be the subject of pillow talk.
I can assure you, they're not.
- Roy and I are not in a...
- You are the mother of his child, no?
Please, please, sit down,
make yourself comfortable.
I don't want this to seem
like an interrogation.
You want another one?
Mm, another one of what?
You are something.
So, how long have you two
known each other?
- We only met today.
- Yeah.
He is my newest best friend.
Yes, I am.
Alice is a dental hygienist.
Which is weird
'cause I totally hate teeth.
I mean, just the texture of them
grosses me out.
But, you know, I'm...
I'm all about a challenge.
I like to, like, push myself
out of my comfort zone.
It's the only way to grow, really.
So true.
He's so pretty. Isn't he pretty?
I got to pee. I'll be right back.
You should take her home, Roy.
You should take her home.
Yeah.
It's for you.
Who wants to call me now?
I don't know.
- Hello?
- Roy, can you hear me?
Jemma? What...
Are you still at the lab?
It's-it's almost 3:00 a. m.
Jemma, Jemma, are you okay? You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine, but...
- What... what-what's going on? Listen...
Yeah, listen to me.
I think I might have to do
something drastic,
and if anything happens, promise me
you'll do what you do,
but just take care of Joe.
I can't, I can't, I can't hear you.
- Jemma?
- I'm gonna need your help.
Wait, wait, wait. W-What's going on?
- Are you okay?
- I can't explain it right now, but...
you wouldn't understand, anyway.
Hey, I think I lost you.
Jemma, call me back, okay?
- Who was that?
- It was my ex, and she was...
she sounded pretty worked up.
It seems our dear doctor has gone rogue.
Find her.
What did I miss?
Oh, hi.
Uh, well, you know, we were talking about
the hottest people on the planet,
and naturally your name came up.
Yeah!
I should've tried to call Jemma back
when I was drunk and horny
and I didn't give a shit.
I didn't know how important it was.
I didn't know it'd be the last time
that I'd ever hear her voice.
Some things you can't redo.
And some things you're forced to do
over and over again.
I know this whole thing leads back to her.
I just have no idea
what this whole thing actually is.
Did you get my birthday present, Roy?
Did you get it, the present?
I don't know. I haven't checked.
Well, please do. I sent it a few days ago.
Remember this.
Osiris.
"Happy birthday, Roy.
"May you always live your life forward
and always remember
"time waits for no man.
XOX..." Oh...
Fuck me.
Let's do that again.
I'm being carjacked!
Fuck!
Come on, come on. Let's go.
Dude, die already. Goddamn it!
He's in my way!
About fucking time.
I'm being carjacked!
Don't read and drive, moron.
Ha!
How did I never notice this?
Shit, I missed the exit
to the Chinese restaurant,
and the last time I went anywhere else,
it ended up really bad.
I call this guy Smiley,
for obvious reasons.
At least getting shot is simple,
straightforward stuff.
Yeah! Get some!
Who the hell thinks up shit like this?
Get some!
All I've been doing is
running for my life this entire time.
Now I've got my first real clue
to what the fuck might be happening to me.
All I need now is a little cease-fire
and somewhere quiet
where I can get some reading done.
Osiris and Iset were devoted
husband and wife. Blah-blah.
She was an Egyptian high priestess,
"ideal mother and wife,"
"protector of the dead,"
"skilled in all magical spells
for transport
through the afterlife and beyond."
"Osiris was eventually
dismembered into 14 parts
and scattered across Egypt by his enemy."
What the fuck kind of
birthday present is this?
Happy birthday, Roy.
May you always live your life forward
and remember
time waits for no man.
Joe.
What the hell's he doing?
Shit.
He doesn't know his mom is gone
and he's all alone now.
That I'm the only family he has left.
- How you doing, pal?
- Ten dollar entry, bro-ham.
Five dollar per round, double elimination.
What, uh... What do you got going here?
Pop-up e-sport tourney.
- What is that?
- Competitive video gaming.
Yeah, we do mostly retro
'80s-based side-scrollers.
Double Dragon, Altered Beast,
Street Fighter.
We're purists, bro.
Dedicated to video games' golden age.
Analog or death.
Eight-bit is the shit.
- How old are you?
- The big four-one.
Life creeps up.
- Forty-one?
- Yeah.
You got a son here somewhere?
I'm childless by choice, bro.
Whose choice?
Keep it.
Joe-Joe. Hey.
- Hey, bud.
- Roy. Hey, what's up?
Look at you. You shot way up, huh?
I think you were, like, maybe yea high
the last time I saw you.
I didn't know you were a gamer.
Oh, I am not a gamer.
Then what are you doing here?
Actually, I was gonna ask you
the same question, buddy.
Isn't it a school day?
I ditched.
Come on, buddy,
you can do better than this.
Well, I couldn't not come.
These are, like,
my favorite vintage video games.
- Ah.
- And mom would be really mad
- if she knew I was here.
- Mom would be really mad.
I'll tell you what. I won't rat you out
if you tell me one thing.
Okay.
What did you buy from that boy upstairs,
the older boy?
I didn't buy anything.
Joe, I saw you.
- Oh.
- Oh.
It's an RPG card game.
I traded it with that kid.
You can be, like,
all these different assassins
and mercenaries and stuff.
It's really cool.
I bet it is.
What, you think I was
buying drugs or something?
Or something.
I just turned 11. I can't do that stuff.
You can't do
that stuff ever, pal, okay?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
All right. Let's go get some lunch.
We can come back, okay?
I want to talk to you.
- Okay.
- All right?
Screen is broken, anyway.
Oh. Piece of junk. Come on.
- You hungry, bud?
- Yeah.
Yeah?
- What's your favorite food?
- Pizza.
- Pizza?
- Mm-hmm.
We can get some pizza.
- What about sushi?
- I don't like sushi.
You don't?
- No.
- How come?
Hey, what's up?
- 'Cause it's sushi.
- Oh, that makes sense.
I have to tell him now.
Tell him that his mother is gone.
Tell him that he's never
gonna see her again.
- Tell him that...
- You know, Mom says you're a badass.
Badass? She says that?
Well, she doesn't use that word,
but she says
you're, like, a SEAL team guy
or something, like a soldier.
Mom talks about me?
Yeah, she mentions you a lot.
A lot?
Hey, are you like that guy,
the one from Taken,
who has "a particular set of skills"?
- Liam Neeson?
- Yeah.
No, he's kind of a fake tough guy.
But, yeah, I'm-I'm the real guy.
Really?
I'm not kidding you. That's me.
Oh, that's so cool.
Hey, Joe.
I got to tell you something, bud.
And it's gonna be
pretty hard to hear, okay?
I don't have an easy way to say this.
12:50.
Three minutes longer than I've ever lived.
How?
This all makes sense now.
The diner is underground.
Just like this place.
They're tracking me.
What did you want to tell me, Roy?
Joe.
I'm your father.
In all that fear,
I saw my son's love for me
for a split second, and it was beautiful.
Please... please let this death
be the last.
Motherfucker!
How are you tracking me?!
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?
- Where's the device?!
- Up your ass!
Oh, you're full of ideas.
Fuck off.
Okay, fuck off.
Hey, buddy.
Okay. When you gotta go,
you gotta go.
Where's this tracker?
I know it's here.
Fuck.
Pedro, you want to help me look?
And then I said, "Well, I will see
your counterintelligence expert
"and raise you
a countersurveillance specialist,
- my friend."
- Oh, you are crazy.
You should have seen... I know...
the look on his face then.
- Dude, you're crazy!
- He was like...
- Dave.
- Hey, Roy.
- Hey, sorry to interrupt.
- No, no, no.
I was just telling Chef Jake over here
- about this loudmouth...
- Got it. Great. Good.
Dave, you know anything
about tracking devices?
I don't know anything
about that kind of thing, Roy.
I know everything about
that kind of thing, Roy!
Now, what are we talking?
- Traditional transponders?
- The kind you put on a person.
A body-based or an implantable device?
I don't... What's better, if you,
if you don't want the person
to know they're being tracked?
Well, an implantable version
is loads more reliable.
A body-based device would be
attached to clothing...
See, where do you implant it?
Where would you do it?
Well, most people think subcutaneously,
- just underneath the skin...
- But, Dave, Dave,
- where would you put it?
- Oh, you mean me, personally?
You, personally.
A Dave special.
What is that stupid face, Dave?
Yeah. Yeah.
- He gets it.
- Yeah.
The teeth, Roy. The teeth!
Ideally a molar.
You got to be shitting me.
You look so handsome with the mask on.
You have nothing to worry about.
Just keep breathing deeply.
It'll all be over soon.
Also, your mouth acts as
a natural transmitter.
- Dave?
- Yes?
Would you be able to look at a tooth
and detect if there was
a tracking device in it?
I mean, not while
it's inside someone mouth.
If that tooth were removed,
- I could possibly check it out.
- Jake.
Large bottle of baijiu
and a pair of pliers, now.
No, no, no, no, no!
Oh, goddamn!
Fuck this shit!
- Don't worry, Dave, it'll grow back.
- No, no.
What, have you lost your mind?! No.
No, no, you need some damn help!
- You're being so helpful.
- No! What?!
- What do you think?
- No.
- You sure?
- I'm positive!
- What time is it?
- Shit.
- It is 12:45. Okay?
- Oh, shit. Only two minutes.
No, no, it's time for you
to stop snatching
your damn teeth out of your mouth!
Are you crazy?!
Oh, fuck this shit.
Oh, no, no, no! Oh, God.
Oh, shit! I should've stayed
my Black ass home.
- Look.
- Oh, no! No!
Look!
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah? What?
Yeah. That tooth. Mm-hmm.
There's an irregularity in that tooth.
- There is?
- Yeah.
Oh, my God.
I would need to see inside of it.
- Roy?
- Yeah.
Carefully.
- Yeah.
- Okay?
Careful.
No! No, that's not careful.
- You son of a bitch.
- Oh, my God.
- Roy?
- Huh?
Someone paid a lot of money
to keep track of you.
- They did?
- Yeah. A whole lot.
I've never...
I'll see you soon, Dave.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Who did it?!
- Who put the tracker in my head?!
- I don't know!
- Who did it?!
- A guy called Brett.
Mr. Frat Boy, fake-bake, bald,
400-pound, "I dye my beard hair black,"
douchebag head of Dynow security.
Brett.
I'm gonna punch a giant
fucking hole in his chest.
- What's up, guy?
- Jake.
I need a large bottle of baijiu
and a pair of pliers, now.
I have died 144 times as of today.
But this particular day,
I finally get to do something about it.
Drop it.
- What, the tooth?
- No, not the tooth.
I'm not dropping it.
Well, it drops or you drop.
This is a custom handmade Walther PPK
that cost me nearly
half a million dollars at auction.
You bought a handgun
for a half million dollars?
And had my personal pistol-smith fit it
with a vintage
SD-22 SpielWaffen suppressor,
of which there are six in the world,
for an additional $250,000.
750,000 bucks?
- Correct.
- Why in the fuck, Pam,
would you ever do something like that?
Pam?
Well, I never got your name,
so I just call you Pam.
- We've met?
- Many, many times, in passing.
Let me see it.
Slow.
Hold it by the trigger guard.
Handle it as if it were porcelain, please.
Soft as a whisper.
A.H.?
Adolf.
Hitler.
¿Qué?
It was a personal gift from Carl Walther.
Hitler kept it in his desk in Munich...
You've been killing me
with fucking Hitler's gun this whole time?
It was stolen by
an American serviceman in 1945.
- Jesus, what is wrong with you?
- Fast-forward to the present day...
I didn't think this could get any worse...
- ...it cost me a very pretty penny.
- ...and it has.
- Who sent you?
- Wouldn't you like to know?
- Hint-hint?
- Never.
Are you going to kill me now?
No, Pam, I'm gonna shoot you.
That's for the Jews.
Those, too.
Ooh-wee! Get some!
Come on, boy! Get some!
Jemma put me here on purpose.
I don't know how. I don't know why.
There's got to be a good reason.
Shit, there's got to be a great one.
Look, you lost your phone, little fella.
But she's gone.
I can't get back far enough
to reach her...
- Brett.
- ...so none of this matters now.
There's only one real piece
of business left.
Revenge.
Things are getting warm now.
Did you eliminate the asset?
You mean assets, plural.
- Marshall?
- Hello, Brett.
Don't ask who this is,
'cause you know exactly who it is.
- Where's Marshall?
- Who's that? Bomb boy?
The one I call Kaboom?
Well, he's at a big company barbecue
at the moment.
We're only missing two members:
you and the shithead calling the shots.
You assume there's someone above me.
Well, you're a lapdog, pal,
so there's got to be a leash.
I want who's holding it.
I want who killed Jemma.
I think it's Ventor.
Well, you know where we are, hotshot.
Yeah.
I'll see you in a minute, motherfucker.
I'm guessing the big boss man
has a penthouse view,
but I'm about sick to death
of all the sneaky, stealth,
behind-the-scenes bullshit.
Let's go old-school,
just kick the fucking front door down.
That was a good plan.
I'm gonna gouge his eyes out.
Hold, hold, hold!
- Fall back!
- Let's go!
I can do this all day, dick.
Hello, Roy Number 2.
Goodbye, Roy Number 2.
Go ahead.
Yeah, go ahead.
Roy Number 2 was unarmed, and I'm positive
I'm not getting a weapon past these guys.
Sir.
Oh, yeah, sorry.
Got the card here.
Just gonna...
- Access denied.
- Hmm.
Oh, it's, uh... it's... it must be me.
Usually this doesn't happen.
Sir!
Hi, Roy.
Never say die.
That was weird.
You big motherfucker.
Oh, fuck.
Hello, handsome.
You cut my head off a couple dozen times.
Someone's been the busiest little beaver.
What are you gonna do with that?
I was thinking about fucking you up.
You remember in Raiders,
that asshole who was
twirling the sword round and around,
thinking he was all cool and shit?
And Indy just shot him 'cause
he was exhausted and impatient
and just couldn't take
the bullshit anymore.
- You remember that?
- Yeah.
Fuck!
Something you might not know
about getting killed with a sword,
with the exception of attempt number 15.
Getting killed with a sword
hurts worse than a gunshot.
Another lesser known fact about swords...
...they hurt a hell of a lot more
coming out.
Fun fact: Harrison Ford had the shits,
and that's why he shot that guy.
I am Guan Yin.
And Guan Yin has done this.
I am Guan Yin.
And Guan Yin has done this.
I am Guan Yin.
And Guan Yin has done this.
I'm Guan Yin, and I have done this.
And this isn't even the worst part.
This is.
Ventor.
Man who killed Jemma.
Same bozo that's had me killed
150 fucking times.
Captain, as first impressions go,
this is truly standout stuff.
How you were able to dispatch
the elite level of
high-speed professionals
we threw at you is really remarkable.
You should be pleased with the effort,
regardless of its outcome.
As someone who bears
the same fraternal scars of battle,
I hope that this defeat,
however bitter, holds some solace.
He must have that bullshit memorized,
because it's word
for fucking word and the same
every single fucking time.
All the men I've watched die
and lain to rest,
in their multitudes, I see a singularity.
It's in the eyes.
Their gaze is identical in this moment...
remorse, regret.
"What could I have done?"
"What didn't I do?"
All our best intentions
left to bleed out with the rest of us.
But what if we could
remake our world whole
and erase our mistakes?
What if the ability
to rewrite history was real?
Adolf Hitler, Pearl Harbor...
Wait a minute, wait-wait a minute.
I've never lived past this point,
so all this crap is new.
In whose hands would you entrust a tool
as powerful as the Osiris Spindle?
I have your answer, Captain.
Mine.
A man brought to heel
by the brunt of human misery,
a man who understands,
as you do, the horrors of war.
Who better to oversee
and implement such a tool?
Exactly.
I am sorry about Dr. Wells.
She took us as far as
her flawed ideology allowed her.
Sweet girl.
Blood on your hands is what you wanted
when you came here, Captain.
And blood is what you have.
Just not mine.
Oh.
That's really sharp.
Not even any blood on it.
Is it a katana?
Katana? That's Japanese.
- It's a Chinese sword.
- Let's not make this about race.
It's a sword.
Uh, Brett, um, just...
I know three things now.
One, I'm gonna fuck that guy up
next time I see him.
Two, whatever I'm stuck in
is called the Osiris Spindle.
And three, Ventor has no idea
that it's working.
That somehow Jemma put me
inside this thing and started it up.
But why?
She resurrected her dead husband, Osiris.
Osiris became lord of the dead...
...and the afterlife.
I'm Osiris.
Jemma put me in the Spindle to stop them,
to stop Ventor.
She needs me to keep
repeating this day until I do.
She had... she had faith.
Son of a bitch, she still believed in me.
She knew I could beat 'em.
Hi. I need to learn
how to fight with a sword.
I have no idea what you just said.
Oh. Sorry.
I need to learn how to fight with a sword.
There is something intriguing
about you that I like.
I'm flying home to Shanghai
in the morning.
I would only have a day.
I think we can get a lot done in a day.
Ah! Ah! Ah!
I'm a beginner, but I'm a quick learner.
It is the one who wields it
that makes it a weapon, Roy.
That sword is no more an extension of you
than a set of car keys.
I've had some training,
but I'm willing to work hard.
In lesser hands, the Jian blade
is just a flimsy piece of forged steel.
But within the most determined grip
and under the keenest eyes,
it becomes a weapon of annihilation.
I've had a very good teacher,
but I need to learn more.
Hello, handsome.
Are you surrendering?
Mm... mm, mm.
You're not really gonna fight
with a sword, are you?
I do like your confidence.
Normally I'm a little more chatty.
I do have one thing to say.
I think it'll wait.
Shit's about to get steel.
Motherfucker.
Hmm.
Oh.
What I wanted to say was,
"I am Roy.
And Roy has done this."
W-Whoa.
Brett?
I smell muffins. Do you smell muffins?
I'll just... walk it off.
Now I'm blind.
Looks like a 400-pound unicorn.
You slippery son of a bi...
You gonna go for that gun?
I am not.
- Do you know why?
- No.
Because I'm gonna get great satisfaction
of beating the shit out of you.
How?
How do you think?
The Spindle.
- She activated it.
- Jemma.
She put me inside, pal.
She put me inside to stop you.
- Then you killed her...
- Ow!
...'cause she knew what you were, Ventor.
A wannabe dictator
bent on a worldwide redo.
Fucking liberals.
Before she launched her little Hail Mary,
did she bother to mention
that the Spindle reaction,
if maintained too long,
could destroy the entire planet?
Oh, don't worry, dickhead.
The world comes to an end,
you won't be around to see it.
The Spindle gives us the power of God
to recreate our whole world,
minus the tragedy.
Adolf Hitler, 9/11...
Shut up with this bullshit speech.
The past is the past, Ventor.
It's designed to be left behind.
We live and we learn from it.
And this from an absentee husband
and failed father.
I would've thought you'd have
more than a passing interest
in redoing things.
What about your son?
- My son?
- Young Joe, isn't it?
If you've come all this way to kill me,
well, then who's saving him?
I never thought Joe would be in danger.
I never thought in a million years
that they'd ever target him.
I'll kill Ventor and every one
of those motherfuckers
a thousand times if they hurt that kid.
Sir, sir.
Behind the barricade, sir!
Can't go that way, sir!
Hey, pal, pal, I need you
behind the barricade. Pal!
How many times have I let him die?
My son!
I need you...
That's my son!
No!
It's my son!
I need to save my son!
No! No!
And there it is.
The end of the world. Why not?
Mine's already over.
I can feel it.
Not just death but being unraveled.
Every part of me splits and splits again
along with everything else.
There's nowhere left to run,
and the one person who could help is dead.
So what if I avenged her?
I'm... I'm the one
that killed her, not Ventor.
Me. I did it.
I killed her when
I ran from our relationship.
I killed her when I ran
from raising our son.
I killed her when I didn't call her back.
I'm the reason she's gone.
I'm the reason Joe's gone.
I'm the reason the world ends.
The hell's the point?
Why the hell should I even bother trying?
Nothing will ever matter again.
Not when you've lost
everything you've loved.
Not when you're responsible
for the loss of all human life
as we know it.
Nice job, asshole.
Can't you ever let me
sleep in just once?!
So this is it, then.
This is it, huh?
Are you just gonna feel sorry
for yourself forever, day in, day out?
You're not gonna do a goddamn thing,
even if there isn't
a goddamn thing you can do?
No.
You are.
You're gonna do something.
Time means nothing now.
It's no longer counting against you.
I'm being carja...
You never got to know your son,
so if that's all that's left...
...it's more than you ever deserved.
Hey, Joe.
Roy? What are, what are you doing here?
W-What happened to you?
I fell off a building.
Skipping school?
Let me guess... pop-up e-sport tournament.
- How'd you know?
- Where do you think I'm going?
- You're a gamer?
- Absolutely I'm a gamer.
I knew you were on your Xbox
every time I came over,
but I didn't want to blow it
with your mom,
- you know?
- Yeah.
I'm into, like, the old
'80s vintage side-scroller games
like Altered Beast and Double Dragon.
Street Fighter?
It's my favorite.
Mine, too.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- I like the new stuff, too, though. Uh...
- Hey, Roy?
Hey, you think Mom will be pissed
that I bailed on school?
You know what?
She'll be pissed.
But I'm gonna cover for you, okay?
Okay.
- No more skipping school, cool?
- Cool.
Let's go play some Street Fighter.
- Fight!
- You're gonna die.
- No, you're gonna die.
- Yeah?
You're gonna die and fail.
- Oh.
- Oh. Oh, my bad.
Oh! But I'm still alive!
This game is so old.
What's it called? Glaca?
- No.
- This game's broken.
It's Galaga. Galaga.
Right in your face.
- Hey! I still won.
- What?
I got it.
Ooh.
K.O.
You win!
Why do you like this game so much?
Well, there's a lot of people
that chase you
and you get to kill them.
- That was a power boost.
- Oh, that was Aku... Aku... Arugula?
- Was that the Arugula?
- Hadouken.
Hadouken again!
Haru... ken!
How did you win?
You win!
- This is where it gets hard.
- Yeah. Get the girl.
- Get the girl.
- Get her?
Aw.
Tell you what.
Let me show you how it's done.
Man, these guys keep coming.
You have no idea.
- I'm not worried about it.
- For a kid who doesn't
go to school that much,
you're pretty smart.
I have my ways.
You beat me again.
Akuma is the master!
All the years of this that I missed...
...I want it all back.
He has Jemma's looks,
her smarts, her sense of humor.
Thank God.
Then I see that kid laugh,
and I see myself,
just a flash, see my own face
smiling back at me, it j...
it breaks my heart.
I could do this forever, and I just might.
We've ended this day just like this
over a dozen times now.
Never gets old.
I like that he's sound asleep
when it all ends.
I like that he never stirs once.
I want to tell him that I'm his father,
like I did before, but I'm scared.
I'm scared he won't
look at me that way again
and I won't see what I saw in his eyes.
So I say nothing.
I want to get a boat one day,
take Mom out in it.
She never gets out at all.
I just wish I could rent one.
Could we rent one?
- A boat?
- Yeah.
Take Mom out in it.
- I don't see why not.
- When?
Whenever. I... We could...
This is when I tell him
we can do it this weekend.
Then he sends his mom a text
telling her that we're all going sailing.
This is what usually happens.
Joey...
...you know, your mom...
Yeah?
Do you know what your mom is working on?
The Osiris Spindle?
Osiris Spindle.
- You know what that does?
- She can't talk about it
'cause it's, like,
supersecret and whatever.
But I overheard her say
it could, like, wipe out everything,
like the world, I guess,
if they weren't careful.
Do you believe that?
Yeah, I do.
I wish I didn't.
Your mom trusted me with something,
and I let her down.
What do you mean?
Last night, your... your mom, she, um...
She didn't come home.
I know.
Does she have a new boyfriend?
No.
No, there's no new boyfriend, no.
Did she know I was ditching school?
It felt like you were following me.
Yeah, I wa...
but not for that reason.
- Why, then?
- I... I don't know.
I saw you, and I wanted
to talk to you, catch up.
We haven't sp-spoken to each other.
Why did you think I was following you?
Just something Mom said this morning.
- Wait, what?
- On the phone. It was weird.
She said if I got into any trouble
that I should find you.
Joe, it's Mom.
Pick up the phone, please.
I didn't know what she was talking about.
You spoke to Mom today?
If anything strange happens,
I want you to call Roy, okay?
What time?
I don't know, um...
I'm gonna text you his number,
but call me back.
Bye, baby.
Hey, bud, let me see your phone.
She was still alive when I woke up.
Ventor hadn't killed her.
She wasn't dead yet.
Don't worry, son.
I'll come back for you.
I'm coming back for both of you.
You killed her.
- How the hell did you get in here?
- Where is she?
Where is she?!
You trying to erase the evidence?
Trying to figure out what she was doing.
How she was able
to initiate the Spindle...
Shut your mouth, Brett!
Continue. Continue!
We can't get
the Osiris Spindle to function.
Whatever she did started
a chain reaction we can't control.
She sabotaged it somehow,
and it's not responding.
Son of a bitch.
The Spindle is working.
It's you.
She made you the missing mass.
Otherwise, how could you have
broken into this facility?
How...
How many times have you done this?
A lot.
It works.
She was alive
at least 14 minutes after I woke up.
I have time to save her.
Okay. Let's do this.
Jemma is the only one who can stop this,
and you have at least
14 minutes to reach her.
What the hell. Here we go.
The fucking asshole just jumped.
Fly, motherfucker!
Fly!
I got 12 and a half minutes.
Make this thing go faster.
Move!
Nice flying, dick.
All right, fuck this.
I want a brawl now.
The battle royal.
The boss level.
Bring 'em all on, every last one of 'em
so I can light 'em up and lay waste.
'Cause I've been waiting for this
for a long fucking time.
Maybe too long.
I mean, you know, I don't have all day.
Hey, Brett!
You came for me.
You did it.
You came for me.
How many times did it take?
Just one.
We don't have much time.
Come on.
I couldn't tell you they were
watching me, monitoring me.
I had to sneak around the lab all night.
I barely got that book to you.
It was just enough.
I think Ventor sent men after Joe.
There's no one left.
They're all gone, Jemma.
Joe's fine.
He's skipping school
for a gamer con, but he's okay.
How do you know that?
He's got a crush on a girl
in his class named Camille,
who he showed
all the bus routes in school to,
but he's afraid to ask her
to be his girlfriend.
He and his friend Wyatt,
they lied about their age
a couple weeks ago to enter
a paintball tournament.
You asked him about a welt on his neck.
He said he got it from a bug bite.
He, uh, he fractured his wrist
last month skateboarding,
and now it makes this weird, fun...
- Clicking, right.
- ...clicking sound.
He did a watercolor version
of Van Gogh's Starry Night
about a year ago for your birthday
'cause he knows
that's your favorite painting.
He thinks Mom works too much,
doesn't smile enough.
Oh, but that boy loves you so much.
We have to stop this.
You saw it? The end of the world?
Yeah.
What was it like?
It was everything you imagine it to be,
only a million times worse.
How do I stop this, Jemma?
Not about stopping, Roy.
It's about restarting.
What does that mean?
It means you have to enter
the Spindle's core,
then theoretically
the time-space continuum
should reset and resume.
Theoretically?
I don't know.
I honestly don't, Roy.
I mean, this whole thing's
just so cobbled together.
I was just trying to stop Ventor.
I didn't even know it worked
until you showed up.
You have to remember,
I just saw you yesterday.
And I haven't seen you in forever.
I didn't know what else to do,
where else to turn.
I just knew the man you were, Roy.
I know the man you are.
But I don't know what'll happen to you
if you go in there.
Will it go forward?
If I walk through this thing,
is it gonna reset?
Are you and Joe gonna be safe?
If you return your mass
to the core, it should.
You may not make it.
You may cease to be.
Going in there will likely kill you,
and you'll have to repeat the day
one more time.
And if you die then,
there's no coming back.
Well, then...
...give me a kiss and tell me you love me.
I love you.
Wait for me, huh?
I will.
Okay, asshole...
...just don't die this time.
Piece of cake.
